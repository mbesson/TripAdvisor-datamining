The real shocker was the rooms though \u2013 very modern d\u00e9cor and simple with a European or Asian feel. Although small, I found the room soothing and pleasant, and the bed comfortable. They also had plenty of parking (although getting into some of the spots was tight). On the downside, the shower was low (I\u2019m tall) and had poor water pressure. The bathroom door was awkwardly placed, and had to be kept closed to enable passing through the room. The front desk staff was generally civil but there was sometimes an undercurrent of surliness. The most annoying event was how hot our room would be by the time we returned in the evening, the vents seemed to be blowing hot air although the heat wasn\u2019t on. The maid did seem to turn up the AC pretty high (75 or 80) but that was about the outside temperature and the room felt a lot hotter than that. We\u2019d have to crank the AC down to 60 and open windows to air it out.

It's cheap, cheerful and good value for money if there's one or two of you - just don't bring a kid! The dumb Motel 6 website allows you to cheerfully book a child in a motel that doesn't have room for them! At no stage were we warned that the property could not accommodate children in any way, shape or form. Staff didn't even have a rollaway bed for emergencies. We were told that it 'happens a lot'. Morons. Whilst I'm grateful that the member of staff helped us move the next night to the other Motel 6 across town (after asking her to call and move us), it was still a totally unnecessary stressful situation to be placed in. This should not have happened. This is basic for a hotel website. It cost us time, money, inconvenience with moving luggage and worry. We were lucky as they had one room left. Had we left it until the morning to book, I think we would have been stuffed. Three of us crammed into a bed for the night, because we were too tired to care after a long drive. On the positive side, the room was very clean, fast (chargeable) Wifi, large range of TV channels but a little cramped. Our room was on the top floor which was away from the noise. Parking is right next door (free with a permit) and you can get a great takeaway pizza from the restaurant behind the motel and water/milk from the nearby petrol station.

I was forced to buy a second room so ended up paying double. For that amount of money believe me you can stay at a much nicer hotel in San Diego. For example, The Marriott Residence Inn right down the street has better rooms, offers breakfast and a light dinner, and has a pool too. Back to motel six; they have done some renovations but the room is so small and cramped that even with 2 in it you'll feel claustrophobic. The light in the bathroom flickers constantly, and bring your own pillow. Coffee in the morning is disgusting and only had powered creamer...yuck! Theres are hard as rocks. Also the view from the room looks directly into a room about 4 feet away. Perfect for stalkers! I highly recommend that you don't stay here. I was told by the manager that the fire department allows them to put 4 people in these rooms? If they do they are creating a fire trap.

Nevertheless, it was a safe, clean, and decent place to sleep for a good price (paid between $55-70 based on the night). Main complaints are that the bath towels are quite skimpy, pillows fairly flat (ask front desk for an extra pillow) and there was no shampoo. Front desk has hairdryers upon request - quite useful! The bed on our first stay was quite good; the bed on the second stay left much to be desired - sagging in the middle and left much to be desired. Our room on the second stay was quite a bit bigger but located next to the stairwell - as a result, we heard people going up and down stairs all evening. Both of us our good sleepers, but if you are not, I'd recommend asking for a room NOT near the stairs, and one that faces the courtyard as opposed to the street. Front desk staff was helpful, depending on who was there. The bus and trolley stops were within 5 minutes walking distance, and made transportation quite easy. The Gaslamp district is only a bit farther away. We took the 992 bus to the airport - $2.50 as opposed to the $10-15 taxi fare.

However, that said, the room did appear to be clean. My biggest complaints were the lack of really basic amenities. There was no clock in the room at all. There was no shampoo/conditioner in the room. When I called to get some, they made me walk across the parking lot at 11:00 at night to pick it up from the lobby. Only one very flat pillow per person and to echo another reviewer, the towels were like sandpaper. They could take the money they're investing in their satellite tv and put it into these things instead (who wants to sit in an unpleasant room and watch cable tv anyway?) I know it's just a Motel 6 and you get what you pay for, but I've stayed in a lot of hotel/motels of the same class/price that were a whole lot nicer. It's tolerable for a couple nights, but if you can afford to, stay somewhere else.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "nek0", "ReviewID": "UR5776611", "Content": "I stayed here this summer on my road trip through California for a few days.

I stress motel rooms becuase based on some of the other reviews, I think some people expect the ritz at $69 per night.

There is also a great deli right next door which offers very good cheap breakfast and lunch options. They have a small courtyard inside the hotel which is very nice if you are traveling with a dog and want to take him/her out at night without having to go outside the hotel. The only drawback is that the other guests were less than considerate when walking in the corridors late at night, as they were very loud, but hey, like I said you get what you pay for and I expect these things when I want to stay somewhere cheap.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "LA", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Room\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4053684", "Content": "Had the misfortune of staying at this motel, as nothing else was available.

I didn't complain that he hit his head I just wanted a bandaid, but that wasn't allowed and couldn't be bought from the little vending machines in the laundry room either. Downtown is a horrid place to stay if there is a Paredes game. Don't even think about going to the gaslamp district in your own car because you'll just end up frustrated at the lack of parking. The nice things about the hotel were the price, Motel 6 offers a internet discount on their site. It is very close to everything, it's only 5 miles to seaworld which was the reason we made the trip.

The location has you close to all downtown attractions and walking distance to the Gaslamp. It is located right off of I-5, so if you're a light sleeper, traffic noise may be an issue. The rooms are very small, but parking and local call are free (a rarity in SD hotels). We stayed here for one night in June. It was our first night in San Diego, and we knew we wouldn't be in the room much. The duration of our trip was going to be spent at a hotel in Mission Bay, so we opted for an inexpensive, clean room in downtown for the first night. For the price we paid, the accomodations seemed appropriate. Consider this hotel if you're on a budget or only need a place to sleep for the night.
