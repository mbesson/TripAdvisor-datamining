The shower was an absolute joke with hardly any proper operating pressure. Requests for this to be remedied met with the same response as with the room-safe. The satellite old-fasioned TVs had a poor selection of channels which generally were not properly tuned in.Requests for this to be remedied - yes,you've got it - were treated in exactly the same way as the room-safe and the shower. Breakfast was an experience we would not wish to have to endure again - filthy uncleared tables, juices dispensed from a machine into paper cups, dirty cutlery and appallingly indifferent service. The fruit selection was adequate but at all times we were concerned at the hygiene in it's preparation and of the state of the kitchen given the deplorable couldn't care less attitude of the staff. Coffee (instant) served from a jug had globules of something floating on the surface. We did not eat there again and chose to go elsewhere for our meals.

I was under the impression that this is a 4-star hotel, but feel that it is more of a 2.5 to 3-star facility. The hotel is quite conveniently located in central Dubai. It is a short 15-20 minutes cab ride from the airport and about 10-15 minutes walk from a subway station. There is a 24-hour grocery store on the way to the subway and made it easy to pick up water and snacks. Wireless internet is provided for free in the lobby only and wired internet for a fee (extra for the cord) in the room. The cleanliness of the room was acceptable, but the quality of the room was sub-par. There are a number of places that show unacceptable wear and tear. Quality of the service was somewhat inconsistent. I arrived early and was told I could pay extra to check in early. When I said I would come back later, the front desk changed his mind and said they can have a room ready without charging me extra. There was a problem with my safety deposit box, and although I told the front desk about it before I left for the day, it was not taken care of until I called again the next day. The first hour I was in the room, about 3 staff members knocked on my door to ask if everything was OK. I mentioned to them too the safety deposit box issue and they said it would be taken care of. I interacted with the front desk staff a couple of times. Some staff members were friendly and helpful. A couple others seemed too busy/distracted to give me their full attention. I had no problems with the bed, sleeping comfortably or the noise level. They do provide free shuttle service to both airport and a number of popular tourist destinations. I called ahead to have them pick me up at the airport but was told the shuttle wasn't running at that hour (mid morning).

We booked our stay via hotels.com for 40\u20ac/night and enjoyed our 7 nights at the hotel a lot. The rooftop swimming pool and jacuzzi were very nice and clean (we usually went there in the evening before it closed at 10pm), the rooms (we had the cheapest) were spacious with tv and balcony and they were cleaned every day (new towels and new shower gel, shampoo, etc.). The staff was extremely friendly, even though depending on who was sitting at the reception, they couldn\u00b4t help us much (e.g. we asked about the camel racing court). The location is good, too. Close to the airport, close to a mall (Burjuman) and Al Karama and Meena Basaar are in walking distance. However, if you wanna go to Deira, the beach or to downtown Dubai you gotta take a cab which are really cheap, especially if you\u00b4re not travelling alone (taxi from the airport to the hotel is about 20-30DHS which is like 5\u20ac). Even we as students could afford it and never used the nearby metro a single time. Furthermore, the hotel offers shuttle services (e.g. to Dubai Mall, the beach, Deira) for free which is always on time and reliable. The only thing, I found a bit disturbing was that the walls are quite thin. We were on 7th floor and we could hear the street noise or the baby in the next room crying at night. The food is very good and cheap, but spicy (about 5\u20ac for lunch or dinner buffet). We could leave our luggage until 2am in the night, since we had to be at the airport at 3am and we did not have to pay extra. If I ever go back to Dubai, I would always return to the Winchester.

We stayed here for 7 nights. They do offer an airport pick up service which you can email them about from their website, however we chose to go by taxi. I would probably recommend using the hotel service as it would ahve worked out cheaper! What I want from a hotel is what most people want, a quiet comfortable place to crash after sighhtseeing and enjoying the city all day. This hotel did everything it said it would with no fuss, no frills and no problem. We had an apartment on the 6th floor that had a bedroom, a separate kitchen, a separate bathroom and another living room with 2 sofas - one which was a fold out. There was a TV in the bedroom and the living room. The bed was king sized and very comfortable. The sofa bed was also very comfortable and double sized. Every day the bed and sofa bed was changed by house keeping along with all towels. The air conditioning was very good but be warned it can be freezing if you don't turn it off! We didn't have any sort of view but this wasn't really a problem at all. The pool on the roof was very warm, with a hot jacuzzi at the far end. You could use towels provided up there for you. There were also sun beds there which I didn't use as I only had a swim every evening after a long day out in the sun. It was always empty apart from one evening but this wasn't a problem either as there was plenty of room for all. We had breakfast included and I knew from other reviews that this wasn't going to be what many westerners would expect and so I wasn't disappointed at all. The hotel catered for Indian guests as well as made a good attempt to make western guests satisfied. There was toast and croissants as well as potatoes (in different forms each day - hash browns, mashed or fried with onions) baked beans, sausages, mushrooms and sometimes chicken livers! (yum). They had Indian options which were also very good, along with juices and tea/coffee. Newspapers and TV News were also available to make your breakfast as relaxing as possible. The location is about a 20m walk to Al Karama or Khalid Bin Al Waleed Metro stations as well as Spinneys supermarket, ATM machines, McDonalds, Money Exchange etc... or a very cheap taxi to anywhere else in the city. Be warned that just around the corner there is also another Winchester Hotel as well, owned by the same people I believe - so ensure taxi drivers are aware that this one is on 10B Street around the corner from the other one! Overall I was happy. This would be considered a 3 star hotel with good customer service, FREE WIFI in the lobby, a decent breakfast, a decent pool and a comfortable good size apartment room.

It was situated very close to the Meena Bazar, Burjuman Mall and the Metro station. There are two Winchester hotels : Winchester Grand (which I stayed at) and Winchester Deluxe, they are in the same company. Some of the websites show that they are 4 star, but i think that the one i stayed at is not 4 star but three. The four star is the Winchester deluxe which is a much newer building. The hotel provided a free shuttle service at allocated time which was bonus, but it is not necessary as the taxis in Dubai are very cheap; meters start from 3 dihrams and the minimum charge is 10 dirham. From Bur Dubai where the hotel was to the gold souk in deira (opposite Bur Dubai with a creek in between) costed about 13 dirham, which works out to be about \u00a32.30 approx which is certainly very cheap. We booked two rooms: one studio bedroom and one executive bedroom. The rooms were generally kept tidy. The air condition in the studio bedroom worked properly but it wasn't working properly in executive bedroom. The shower was also not working properly and it seemed the shower head was tired and in need of replacement. The other strange thing was that when the cold tape was opened, hot water came throughout the whole day which made it slightly miserable, but I think this is normal in Dubai, as i I experienced it also in Dubai airport toilets. The swimming pool is small, but well maintained. The best time to cool yourself would be at night. I think that the pool was opening times are 11am to 10pm. The hotel staff will need to improve on their facial expressions i.e smile; which we thought lacked in the staff. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The price for 6 nights was reasonable.

Towels are provided by the hotel at the pool area so there is no need to take your own towel up to the pool and there are also sun loungers and chairs to relax on. The housekeepers made a great job of keeping the room tidy. Clean sheets were placed on the beds every day and the towels were replaced daily too. The toiletries and toilet paper were kept topped up. Check-in and check was fairly swift and problem free. We asked the hotel to provide our transport to the airport and the driver was at the hotel to pick us up bang on time. The free wi-fi available in the lobby area was perfect for us. We would definitely return to the Winchester Grand if we holiday in Dubai again and absolutely recommend it to others.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cPractical and Convenient with a touch of Luxury\u201d", "Author": "Aussie893", "ReviewID": "UR115428609", "Content": "I stayed here for a 3 night stopover between Australia and Europe.

I had a nice big room with a large double bed, a couple of armchairs and tables, and a nice ensuite with toiletries provided and a bath, not just a shower. Everything was very clean and worked fine - ok, if I wanted to nitpick I'd maybe say the TV was a bit of a disappointment - only 2 English channels, and the picture was a bit fuzzy, but then I don't go on holiday to watch TV. I paid about \u00a350 a night room only, I was on my own and I think even for a solo traveller that was good value, but the room would have been plenty big enough for a couple, and would have been excellent value for two! Everything else at the hotel was good as well. As I mentioned, I stayed on a room only basis, but I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant every morning anyway, as the breakfast buffet was good - a nice range of hot and cold food, which varied a bit every day - and good value too, only 25AED, which is about \u00a34.50 at the current exchange rate. There's a nice rooftop pool - although the pool and the pool area are both fairly small, so you need to get up there quite early to guarantee yourself a sunlounger! All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful, and spoke good English. It's in a good location too, close to the city centre, and within walking distance of some nice restaurants and tourist attractions. One other thing worth mentioning - it's a little bit hard to locate! It's in a sidestreet a couple of blocks back from Mankhool Road, the big main road. If you're coming south down Mankhool Road, turn left at the car park just past the Ramada Hotel, go straight on for two blocks, then turn right, and it's on your right, just after another hotel called the Savoy Park. A couple of other tips worth mentioning: There's a big supermarket called Spinneys which is only about 5 minutes walk away on Mankhool Road, and sells pretty much everything food wise you're likely to want - they also sell English newspapers and magazines. Also, if you're desperate for an alcohol fix, the nearest place that serves alcohol is the bar of the Ramada Hotel, also only about 5 minutes walk away on Mankhool Road.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cA very basic hotel\u201d", "Author": "The_Traveller55112", "ReviewID": "UR95957082", "Content": "If you are looking for a basic hotel, this is it!

Upon arrival on December 31st 2010, each of the 2locations' Reception Desk held a speech about \"upgrading\" us to the other hotel. The snake was biting its tail ! Mostly inconvenient moreover is the extremely difficult roadway to reach the location which is inside a streetblock (the other location being easily spotted). Even the map on the hotel's leaflets shows a series of arrows with street names none of which are the same than the reality ('Bank Street' instead of 'Al Mankhool Street')!

Second, setting the temperature for the AC didn't work (so it was always cold when it was on). Also, at first the washing machine and the microwave didn't work because the hidden cables were not connected! Some parts in the kitchen were missing too. These last two things they fixed quickly. The service was very good and they were very friendly. I didn't eat breakfast or meals in the restaurant so I can't grade it. I liked the gym and the roof-top pool.

It wasn't far from the airport, so it cost 40 dhirams in a cab (which is about \u00a38 english money). There is supposed to be a shuttle or a free shuttle, but there was some confusion over ours and we just got a cab, for the price it was certainly easier than waiting around. Check in was very smoothish... BUT we had booked a studio room. We were told that they had no studio rooms so would be upgraded to a 1 bed (this sounds good right?). However we were told that we might have to leave the 1 bed and go back into a studio if they needed the room later. This was rather annoying as it meant that we were worried about unpacking and filling the fridge, etc in case we were suddenly told to leave the room (which we were not!). I was quite relaxed about all this as I am easygoing but it made my friend tense and he argued with the staff and said it would be unfair if we had to change rooms midway but there was little resolution there. The 1 bed apartment was spacious and we were happy with it. When a fuse blew I called reception and they came and fixed it straight away. My only complaint and it is kind of a biggy is that there are intrusive building works going on all around the hotel and they are very very noisy all day long. This means you can never relax on your balcony (which is a terrible building site view anyway) because the noise is just so loud. If you are going out in the day or staying in your room with the balcony door closed then you will not be too bothered by this. We found the staff REASONABLY friendly. We booked a shuttle for the journey back to the airport. Well not only did we not get one, but we were told we would have to pay for it. In addition the price was slightly more than a taxi would have charged, so you are better off just getting a taxi! Because this hotel is in Bur Dubai it is not near all of the attractions. There is a FREE shuttle bus once a day to the beach (and back) and a FREE shuttle to a few other places (not the airport!). I would not book tours through the hotel as they are more expensive. Get a phone number from the Dubai Map available in reception, there are lots of tour companies listed there. Internet is not included, it is rather expensive. However if you take a walk to Mankhool road, (a rather main road a few minutes away) there are some eating places that have free wifi. As alcohol is difficult to get hold of, they will direct you to the bar at the Ramada hotel. It is horrible and chavy there. You are better of finding a hotel called the Park Regis Hotel which is a 5 minute walk away (very modern). They have a bar in there called the Grandstand Bar and between 6 and 9 there was a 2 for 1 happy hour making the drinks very affordable. Aside from that alcohol in all of Dubai is very expensive and very difficult to get hold of. There is a lovely gym there with many weight/resistance machines and a cycle, 2 treadmills and a rower (no crosstrainer). It is all modern and working equipment. Also a male and female sauna, those facilities were all good. We didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food but it looked reasonably priced (29 dhirams for dinner - that's about \u00a36 english pounds). Lots of supermarkets/restaurants/McDonalds/KFC/Burger King nearby. On the roof there was a pool with sunloungers, it was not a huge space but adequate and pleasant. If I needed to be in this part of Dubai again I'd stay here, but next time I'll stay nearer to Jumeirah beach.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore, India", "Title": "\u201cFeel at home\u201d", "Author": "girijamenon", "ReviewID": "UR88707549", "Content": "I had booked myself to a one bedroom apartment.
