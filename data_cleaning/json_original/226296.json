I love this website. But anyway; We have been to Cancun 3 times and thought maybe we'd try Playa. I'll never go back to Cancun again. My husband and I stayed at El Dorado Suites for 4 nights during the first week of Dec. we really liked the quaintness of Playa Del Carmen and decided to bring our 3 kids 18, 16, and 7 back for Christmas. It wasn't easy to find availability in some of the All-Inclusive resorts so I started looking at the smaller hotels and found Blue Beach Club. It was the best looking (from their website) beachfront property in the town of Playa available so I booked it. The first night we stayed in an oceanfront room. It was O.K. Definately oceanfront! It was clean but too small for my family so we upgraded to a suite. Only $65 more per night. It was located directly above the small restaurant they have. It was very nice. We had a seperate bedroom w/ bathroom. A bedroom area with a dbl. bed, a pull-out sofa bed in the \"living area\", and another bathroom. We had a kitchenette with a frig, stove, microwave, sink, and a breakfast bar. It was well equiped with dishes, pots and pans and silverware. It overlooked the ocean. It had a balcony with a hammock, table and 4 chairs and a wonderful breeze. The beachfront restaurant is small but the food is genuinely mexican, it's very fresh (we saw the pick-up truck drive up and sell them fish (some stlill alive). The breakfast is only $3.99 and more than the average person could ever eat. Coffee is great, but isn't all coffee great when your sitting next to the ocean? The beach is public and yes there are fishing boats directly in front of the hotel but there aren't any in front of the hotel next door- maybe a 100' ft. to your right. Really it's no big deal. My kids played in the ocean all day and were in plain sight from our lounge chairs. The staff was wonderful, very accomodating. Our drinks were always fresh and the staff would be there the minute you even looked like you needed something. Very friendly! Jose at the front desk was wonderful and came up to us more than once during our stay to ask if everything was OK. (by the way- he didn't know I was a travel agent until check-out) so his intentions were genuine. This hotel wasn't what my kids are used to. We usually stay at mega all-inclusive resorts when they travel w/ us, but honestly we had a much better time. We were together w/out all of the distractions of 5 pools and the video arcade. Overall if your looking for excitement and a high energy place- don't stay here. If your looking for laid-back \"Margaritaville\" this is the place. We also loved the fact that we were directly on the beach and also within 2 blocks of 5th avenue. (My teenagers also loved the location). I would definately recommend this hotel to my clients (depending on their needs, expectations and budget).

We faced the street, and were on the ground floor, so had no view of the ocean, but that was fine. Construction of a new condo complex right across the street began at 7am every day, and continued until after dusk. But, of the 40 or so workers, nobody had power tools, so after awakening the first morning to the sound of unexpected construction, it became routine to wake up daily to the sound of hammering, and then drift off for another hour or two of sleep. Geez, construction in Playa? Get used to it. It's a booming town. There is construction everywhere. The day would usually begin with my wife and I walking down to the beach (about 25 paces away) to the hotel's beach bar/restaurant, and enjoying breakfast. Then it was back to the room for some sun lotion, or a walk further into town for groceries, or just relaxation. Then before lunch we'd wander back to the beach and find a couple of vacant lawn chaises (definitely in short supply for the hotel...only a dozen or so). Drinks & lunch on the beach set up some great r & r in the afternoon. The boats anchored just offshore were not a concern, simply adding to the charm of the location. The water was warm and incredibly clear, and quite shallow. I would walk out about 100 yards from shore, and it was still only waist-deep. And what a great location. Short walking distance to 5th Ave., which I loved, with all of its bars and restaurants. I'd give the hotel a 3.5 if I could. It's trying to be a 4, but I can't give it that. Yet, the location is great, and yes, I'd stay there again, and definitely would return to PDC, in a heartbeat. Thanks to Juan Carlos and the guys.

After registering our disapproval, to no avail, we were given two Superior suites for the first night. The next day we were given a Master Suite, not a garden view, but a view of the street and the construction site across the street. Our rooms refrigerator just barely worked and the showers water pressure was very inconsistent, going from nothing, to a trickle, to a good stream. It also varied in temperature from very hot to cold. Suffice it to say that we did NOT get what we reserved and what the web site advertises. Although we stayed there and had a good time we would not go back there. On the plus side the maid service was excellent and the support staff were very pleasant and helpful. What was most disturbing was the reservation not being what was reserved and no apology or explanation offered. So even with a guaranteed reservation at Blue Beach you may not get what you think you reserved. We did not find the boats tied up at the beach in front of the resort to be a problem as others have indicated in previous posts. Blue Beach has a distinct lack of beach chairs available in relation to the number of rooms / occupants.

We found Blue Beach via the internet and liked the location and price,and we are easy to please so we figured we could handle any less-than-awesome lodging. We were so pleasantly surprised by how nice our Junior Suite turned out to be! The kids got \"their own room\"(they shared the futon) and the shower was big enough for all 4 of us to spray off after playing on the beach. Sure there was a little rust here and there and the kitchen appliances/utensils were a little out of date, but I was grateful for the fridge and the dinette set and hey--we go to Mexico not for perfect sparkling accomodations, but the perfect sparkling Caribbean waters! The kids loved that we could hop our little patio wall and be right there on the beach. There were some small fishing boats tied up right there, and some might not like that, but our son was in heaven watching the \"boat dudes\", and we could sit right at a little table in the shade sipping pina coladas while they buried each other in the sand right in front of us. I never worried about security there at all....we put anything of value in the safe that is in the room. We only walked about 1/4 mile at the most up the beach to a nice wide area for laying out and playing in the water. And the amount of incredible shops and restaurants that are within EASY walking distance will make your head spin. We took a cab to the ferry dock for only a few bucks and the ferry to Cozumel is enjoyable and cheap too. DO NOT GO HERE if you don't like to get friendly with locals, or if you require pristine lodging, or if you aren't adventurous about trying new foods in all the great little hidden treasures around town (expensive all-inclusives are for you!)
