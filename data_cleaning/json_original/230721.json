{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cheap And Cheerful We stayed at the jolly for two nights in June. Check in was very fast and we stayed on the top floor. Upon first entering the room we were quite pleased, nice bathroom and bed. Huge terrace outside with great views. The air con worked fine. However it is extremely noisy at night, very loud music from outside which we could hear from the top floor and through double glazing!! Also we came away with a number of bites, we had insect spray but even that didn't work so perhaps bed bugs are to blame. I would probably advise not to stay here, location is about a 15 minute walk from the centre of florence.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR997042004", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ajtoynebeesmith"}, {"Content": "Umm Never Again Our small tour group of 14 stayed here this past month in June 2008 for two nights. The Jolly Carlton is in the process of major renovations. Scaffolding and cloth cover about 70 % of the windows. It took me three different room changes over a period of one night to find a working AC to cool the room. 35 degrees cel. ( 85 to 90 degrees farenheit was more than we could bear). If you have to stay here, best bet is a bottom floor since heat rises. At one point, others in our tour group had no hot water and soon after my own 10 year old son took a bath in brown water that was clearly from rusty pipes. The mgmt. did not seem too alarmed by this. We won't stay here again. If you must, wait until the renovations are done and perhaps these problems will be fixed. The lobby and restaurant is newly renovated, looks nice and were the most comfortable parts of the hotel. The Jolly Carlton advertises itself as a 4 star hotel, which in my experience was not correct given our stay and the mutilple difficutlites we experienced.", "Date": "Jul 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR287895281", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "josiah97"}, {"Content": "Big Disappointment!!

Our room was fairly large, with two twin beds and a sitting area with a table and two wingback chairs.

It was very clean and the housekeeping staff were very prompt when we asked for extra pillows.The lobby is very impressive, and we found the service at the front desk to be good. There is internet access in the lobby if you buy a card. The wait staff in the breakfast room seemed a little stressed, I think they are understaffed. Globus always uses this hotels for their tours, so you would think the hotel management could deal with this a little better. The location of the hotel is not ideal, it is about a 20-30 minute walk at my pace along the river, it is quite scenic however. As for the area, we found it to be fine. We wandered all around and found many cheap restaurants a little north of the hotel, in an area that seems to be the real Florence where people live and not the touristy centre where you have to pay an arm and a leg to eat anything.

The lobby was very welcoming although the hotel staff seemed inconvenienced by any type of question. It's very true that the bus stop is close to the hotel, but it doesn't always take you where you want to go. We asked the hotel staff for a bus route map and they said it didn't exist. They just told us to get on the 1 bus and it would take us wherever we needed to go (which is didn't!). But I digress...The room was ok for a European room. For some reason it felt a little spooky to me at night, but that's probably the result of too many Stephen King books. We never had any problems with noise at night, so I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. Although we were so tired by the end of the day, we wouldn't have heard anything!The location of the hotel was disappointing. As another reviewer mentioned, the hotel is not centrally located. Stay somewhere else if you don't want to walk far.The cleaning staff did a very good job. Although, we arrived and the 2 twin beds were separate which they should not have been (we were on our honeymoon). I called the front desk to request that the beds be made into a queen size, but the request was never fulfilled. I moved the beds together every night, and you would have thought that the cleaning staff would have gotten the point that we wanted the beds together. But no, every day they separated and made up as 2 twin beds.After staying in Rome for 6 days with a mediocre breakfast, we were thrilled with the breakfast at the Jolly. They had wonderful jams and jellies. And unlike the other hotels we stayed at, the scrambled eggs were made perfectly.Anyway, the hotel was fine, but we wouldn't stay there again just due to the location.", "Date": "Jul 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR976239678", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Nice Place Location was great - away from major tourist spots - but walkable (10 block to the Ponte Vecchio).

We stayed at this Hotel for 5 days in June, 03 and all 3 of us found the staff at reception desk quite indifferent. This is obviously a popular hotel for American tour groups; too bad that the staff doesn't seem to appreciate the business. The rooms are acceptable for European standard. Quite noisy at night as there's a disco/bar directly downstairs. Also, it's not true that it's within walking distance to Ponte Vecchio and city center. Yes, you can walk there, but it takes a good 25-30 min., by which time you're all hot and sweaty. You maybe tired already, but then it's time for you to really start walking either to museums or other interesting sites. The upside is that you're not going to gain any weight from all that gelato and pasta, because you're forever walking and walking.
