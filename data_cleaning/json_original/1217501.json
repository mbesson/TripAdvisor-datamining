( formely jena hotel ) as soon as i stare at room i return and ask for an explanation and change room, finally in order to get the real ramada rooms ( they sell those rooms like SUPERIOR ONES WHEN Those rooms are just standard ramada rooms) at the end they refuse to give the ramada room, so i pay another 50 usd in order to get my room. please just make reservations on www.ramada.com pros: the ramada rooms ( superior ones) are fine, new bed linen soft and cool to sleep in. coffe maker, flat screen and laptop safe in room. cons: HORRIBLE AREA is not reforma avenue but a near street where prositutes hang by night and drunk people also not safe after dark belive me , even there is a metro station right in the back of the hotel corner, after 7pm the area become ugly and fell unsafe. so if you decide to stay here, please dont go by night on yourself , grab a taxi fron the hotel and dont use bus or sub. if you plan to visit mexico city and stay safe at night its ok, as long you dont mind dont go out after dark ( belive me is an ugly are by night ) i would not stay again EVER.. I PREFER EMPORIO REFORMA HOTEL NICE HOTEL SMALL LUXURY HOTELS OF THE WORLD WWW.SLHW.COM OR stay in holiday inn zocalo www.ichotels.com but not hotel jena tricky ramada reforma ( the real name must be RAMADA TABACALERA OR RAMADA HIDALGO) so my advice is to choose a better hotel and even cheaper with LOTS OF FACILITIES AND NICE SUROUNDIG AREAS LIKE ZOCALO ( DOWN TOWN MEXICO CITY CENTER) the best option in zocalo is the new hampton inn, breakfast buffet include \u00a1 \u00a1 great stay with soft bed and luxury linen.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alaska", "Title": "\u201cSweet staff - Nice Rooms - Great Breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "AlaskaFamily99", "ReviewID": "UR27412261", "Content": "Staff: Friendly, helpful staff. Very welcoming and nice especially when you don't speak Spanish. They made us feel very welcome. Helped us find our way around. Helped us find tours at reasonable rates. Room: GREAT. clean. nice beds, nice blankets, tv, phone, wireless internet available for free (we didn't have our ipod though). Bright, airy, cheerful atmosphere. Water ok to drink from tap. Air conditioning was perfect and you could adjust to your liking. EXCELLENT. Pool: very nice with a whirlpool attached. Nice place to let your kids get some energy out while you can rest on the reclining chairs or sit at a table. Sunroof so sun comes in during day. Bar with tv right at pool. Location: Location wasn't that great but wasn't really far either from the Alameda park and Centro Historico / Zocalo. Only about 40-50 pesos to get to the Zocalo by cab. $151 Pesos from the airport to the hotel. Not too far to walk (only 5 blocks from the Alameda park) but I was 7 weeks pregnant and didn't want to overdo it. One bad thing on location: there were prostitutes a block away. Ew. You don't stay here for the location. Once you're in the hotel, everything is great. Free breakfast: the complimentary breakfast buffet was awesome with friendly quick staff. Yummy food. fresh fruit and juices. coffee. hot and cold food available. Cost: it costed us about 100 US per night but its worth the price when you have a family and are pregnant. We'd definately stay here again if we ever found ourselves in Mexico City.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHad a very nice stay\u201d", "Author": "EclecticNature", "ReviewID": "UR21159722", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for two nights before heading out to Tlalpujahua, Mexico.

The room was very clean, and there was a separate sitting room. The staff was exceedingly friendly and warm. The bar/restaurant downstairs was very adequate and had good breakfasts. The beds are rock hard (I am told that is a common thing in Mexico). It did feel a bit dated but charming.

I was traveling with my roommate. He is from Tampico Mexico. He was treated like a provincial at the expensive hotel and he wanted out. There are several scouts in front of the expensive hotels that look for customers who want to change hotels. There was one from the Jena outside our hotel. He took us to the Jena and we immediately changed. The decor is old. Not beat up old, just out of date. If you like 1970's style decor this is the place for you. The rooms are huge and clean. The hall ways are monstrous. The bathrooms are done in marble, are clean and well stocked. They also have a bide, and bathtub (bathtubs are rare in Mexico). We had a double bed plus a small TV room with cable. The staff was very pleasant and spoke English. They have an internet connection in the lobby and money exchange. The cafe was average. There are several fonda's (cafe's) and small convenience stores within a block of the hotel plus a Hospital across the street. They can arrange a private tour of the Teotihuacan pyramids.

We needed to stay close to this neighoborhood and thus arrived without reservations which was fine. The decor is outdated but the hotel is clean, the staff was friendly and they have internet access in the lobby for 25 pesos an hour. They also have a restaurant which was a bit overpriced for the area but turned out to be convenient since they have room service. The rooms have color television with basic cable and remote control and the bathroom had a clean bathtub. It is one block from the metro stop Hidalgo. I paid about $63 US dollars each night for three nights from Friday night to Sunday. The hotel is six stories. We were given a room next to the elevator which should be avoided in any hotel. Some friends were given a room for the same price accross from us which had a seperate second TV/sitting area! On the second night at the hotel my girlfriend got really sick (not related to the hotel or the trip). We were really worried and scarred that she might need to be hospitalized. She was in agonizing pain and then I noticed that the hotel offered medical services. I called the front desk and they connected me to a clinic. I spoke to a nurse who also had me talk to a Doctor. For 500 pesos (about $50 U.S. dollars) they came to the hotel room. I was told that the bill would be higher if they had to administer any medications. The Doctor and the nurse were very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. They told me they would arrive in 15 minutes and they did. The Doctor correctly diagnosed my girlfriend and the nurse administered two shots which almost immediately took away her pain (one was a pain reliever and one was an antibiotic for her condition). The bill turned out to be $180 dollars due to the medications but worth it. If she needed to, they told me they could also arrange for her to get an ultrasound at the hotel! If she needed to be taken to the hospital then they would have arranged for that. Fortunately she responded well to the shots and the Doctor also gave her prescription medications which were effective. I should also mention that we are two women and this did not seem to be an issue with the hotel staff, the doctor or the nurse. Thus, I am rating this hotel as Excellent since I am very grateful for their services, in addition to it being reasonably priced, clean, nice, and not far from the Zocalo. We walked to our hotel from the Zocalo in about 15-20 minutes and I am a slow walker!", "Date": "March 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Duluth, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, Quiet, Inexpensive\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3102773", "Content": "I have stayed at the Hotel Jena a few times over the last few years, and have always found it to be more than acceptable. The rooms are clean, the place is generally quiet, and it is conveniently located. It is quite close to Metro Hidlago, and within walking distance of Alemeda Park, the Monument to the Revolution, and the National Lottery Building (plus lots of other places). BTW, it is close to one of my favorite places to eat in all of Mexico City - Tacos al Caminero. As you leave the Hotel Jena, head towards the Monument to the Revolution. Walk to the Monument, and once you get there head to the left. You'll find Tacos al Caminero nearby. In any case, ask at the hotel if these directions don't make sense. BTW, most of the staff don't speak English too well, so a little Spanish helps. The restaurant at the Hotel Jena is ok, although better options are nearby, including the previously mentioned Tacos al C. and there is are VIPS and Sandborns quite near by as well. Prices at the Hotel Jena have been around 40-50 dollars (US) per night in recent years, which is higher than some of the smaller hotels nearby, but must less than some of the more popular places in that area (Hotel Melia, for example). I have never made reservations and they always seem to have a room for me, but they certainly will take reservations. All in all a very pleasant place in a convenient and interesting location.", "Date": "January 31, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ramada Reforma", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d1217501-Reviews-Ramada_Reforma-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$73 - $93*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Puente de Alvarado No 22</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col Tabacalera</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">06030</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1217501", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8d/40/8d4013155a5072ca470c5f80f05a6d6a7large.jpg"}}
