This is one of the nicest hotels in Toronto and is a great location. The service is very friendly, professional and discrete. Though we weren't there to be tourists, this would be an ideal hotel for any purpose - tourists, business, or any other reason. Our room was a suite with a separate living room. It was very clean and the bed was great. We didn't arrive until after 1am and then were supposed to check out at 11am, but realized we didn't get a chance to really enjoy the room. So we booked for an extra night. Yorkville is a great area to stay and since you are near the subway you can get anywhere else downtown. There's a Whole Foods across the street so we picked up lunch and brought it back to our room. We spent the afternoon at the Stillwater spa in the hotel and it was fantastic. As we were about to leave the hotel to find a place to eat for dinner, in the elevator there was a delivery person with some great smelling Indian food being delivered to the hotel, so we asked what it was. The delivery person told us it was from a healthy Indian takeout place in Yorkville called Veda Healthy Indian Takeout. We love Indian food, so when we heard it was healthy we decided instead of calling for delivery to enjoy a short walk through Yorkville to Yonge Street about 5-10 minutes (2-3 blocks) away at Yorkville Avenue. We really enjoyed the food from Veda with some wine that we ordered through room service and had the hotel bring up to our room. It was nice to just relax in our big comfortable suite with good healthy Indian food and a great bottle of wine. After dinner we enjoyed a nice drink at the rooftop bar. It was a nice atmosphere but pretty quiet the night we were there. We've been to several weddings at this hotel before and have always enjoyed the service and quality. There are other nice hotels in the area and it can be a bit pricey, but it is well worth it. Park Hyatt is a good quality brand that we know we can trust to always be consistent. We would definitely recommend this hotel if your company is paying or you want to splurge to be guaranteed good service.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart, Germany", "Title": "\u201cStay with style\u201d", "Author": "VfB 1893", "ReviewID": "UR126291366", "Content": "This hotel is old, really old - but you know what?

Breakfast is excellent. Really worth the money and the staff is very corteous. Bell boy and reception also excellent. Valet parking is a little pricey, but i did not find any space to park... I was a little disappointed with the rooftop bar - I really do not know what is so special about it.

The valet was quick and professional, however at $40 it should have been. When we entered the room the ice bucket was full of half melted ice. I called down to ask for more, then called down twice more, finally going down to the desk after an hour of no one coming up with anything. While talking with the front desk about what the problem was the doorman commented they were only at 37% occupancy. How a four star hotel has trouble with something simple like this while not even busy is troubling. This was a sign of things to come as on two different occasions we were told that the house car was not available for us to use, the first time the driver was about to get off of his shift, and the second time we were informed that it only ran from 6pm-10pm on a Saturday. The hotel lobby is very nice as is the driveway up to the hotel and the corridors to the room. The room itself was okay, however nothing besides perhaps a deep seated tub and 3 pieces of art differentiated this hotel from a Sheraton or a holiday inn. We stayed in a deluxe double room which was not worth the up charge for a small sitting area. We were all unimpressed for what the hotel presented on the website vs what we experienced. Definitely not worth the money we paid, we traveled to the Hyatt regency in Toronto also, which we found nicer for a better price. The money paid for the room is not an issue, however the value for the price paid was just not there.

Been in better, but definitely more better appointed than a run-of-the-mill hotel. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was dated and wallpaper was even starting to peal at the edges; needed an updated. My main complaint was for an expensive hotel I could not believe how poor the sound-proofing was. We were near the elevator and could hear everything, all the time.

Furnishing was fine, bathroom was clean and roomy. Everything worked. Ah, no coffeemaker, but it seems many hotels are doing away with them. What a shame.

The bed was comfy, but not as nice as Fairmont beds, in my opinion. But there was really nothing major to complain about the room. Had dinner at the restaurant (and breakfast the next morning). Now that was a major disappointment. The dinner was really sophomoric. I can get this level of food anywhere for half the price. Service was diner-resque. Not impressed at all. Certainly it's nothing like the Epic or Toca. And breakfast? Well, I wanted a cup of coffee real quick and something to fill the stomach before going back on the road. Parking was valet for $40.

Great bathroom, big counter for standing all your stuff on - and lovely large and fluffy towels, bathrobes etc. If I have any criticism, it would be that the whole place is very \"neutral\" - and maybe a bit lacking in character - inside the hotel, you could really be anywhere in the world. There was a bit of noise in the hallways at night - but that was a wedding party, which I guess probably happens most places. We didn't use most of the facilities but did visit the rooftop bar on two occasions... Amazing view of the city, great cocktails and nice food. Not cheap, but friendly service (on our last night we ordered a pizza and a salad to share, and they split our salad into two nice portions in separate bowls without being asked) and nice surroundings made it worthwhile.

The dinner was amazing and well worth the money, staff had excellent recommendations for wine, dinner. After dinner, we walked around Yorkville, had coffee and dessert. We got ready for bed and went to sleep. My friend was wearing a nice new expensive white nightie (this detail you will see later). She turned the light on to find the bathroom in the middle of the night and on her way back to bed, she let out a scream. Her fitted sheets were filthy, stained, the sheets were never cleaned. There was fecal matter all over the bed (urine, semen etc.) it was absolutely disgusting. We called the front desk and the could not do anything about it until the morning when the housekeeping manager was inn. The odd thing was there was no top sheets on either bed so I cannot imagine they change the duvet comforter after each guest leaves. We ended up sleeping or trying to sleep fully clothed as her new white nightie was covered in matter from the previous guest. She had to take a hot shower for a while and throw out her nightie. The next morning what was supposed to be a nice day, we went down to get the hotel manager at 7am. He could not be bothered to come up to our suite but send the housekeeping manager who was appalled by what he saw, called another staff person to see it. He apologized and said he had new housekeeping staff and will assure they will change the sheets after each guest and he will be talking to the front desk about it and the hotel management. We go to check out, not an apology from management, we still had to pay for our very expensive room. They offered to comp our $20 parking and that was it. We were shocked by their lack of compassion for our ordeal. My friend who was in tears by the experience wrote a letter to the hotel and not a response. I have many friends in the film industry who come to Toronto each September, they all know of our experience and I tell them all to stay at the Four Seasons. We tell everyone of our story, for a hotel of this calibre your money is spend elsewhere. I will never stay here again, or recommend staying her.

The location of this hotel is convenient for shopaholics as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw away from boutique shopping in Yorkville and designer shopping on Bloor. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth noting that there is no airport shuttle available and the hotel is a $60 cab ride from Pearson. Having missed dinner due to my late flight, I asked the concierge for late-night food suggestions upon arrival. Though he initially thought most nearby restaurants would be closed (other than McDonalds, Tim Hortons, and Room Service), he did come up with a lifesaver \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hemmingways Pub across the street. Afterwards, I enjoyed a drink and view of the city at the Roof Lounge on the 18th floor. Unfortunately, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to enjoy the steam room, sauna, hot tub, or fitness centre at the Stillwater Spa (available to hotel guests at no cost); however, I did take a mini tour and the spa amenities seemed wonderful. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Park Hyatt. We highly recommend it for both business and leisure!", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, personal service.\u201d", "Author": "FRTravelbug", "ReviewID": "UR104937983", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel for one night with my mother.

Everything about our experience in this hotel was just perfect. I'd arrived from a work trip to the US while my partner came directly from the UK, and a week here was just what we needed. Our airport taxi dropped us at the entrance, and the door staff had our bags on a trolley before we were out of the taxi. They looked at our luggage tags and greeted us by name. In the lobby my partner was shown to an armchair while I checked us in. The person who greeted me outside introduced me to the desk staff by name and ensured check-in was processed promptly. A concierge then showed us briefly where the spa, restaurant etc were and directed us to the lifts and our room. This was amazing service given that we haven't ever stayed at this hotel before and aren't members of their frequent guest programme. The room was really very impressive. It was a Park Suite, which consists of a living room and bedroom (see my photos). The living room has a minibar (which we didn't use), sofa, writing desk, coffee table and chair. There's a flatscreen TV too. The bedroom has a King bed (very comfortable), a further flatscreen tv, bedside tables etc. There is an ipod docking station in each room, and each room has a large cupboard with a motion-activated light. There is ample wardrobe and drawer space. The bathroom was very nice, with quality toiletries that were replenished as required. There was a nightly turndown service including two bottles of water, and the room was serviced at least twice daily (judging by how often things were tidied if we were back at the hotel during the day). There was free wifi throughout the hotel, which was easy to use. A newspaper was delivered to our room every morning in a branded Park Hyatt bag, which I thought was a nice touch (though I only read it once - I was on holiday!) We didn't have any spa treatments but as hotel guests we could use the facilities, including the relaxation area (with tea, snacks, magazines, fishtank etc), and male/female jacuzzi, sauna and steam rooms. All the staff we interacted with were helpful, friendly and courteous. Everyone from the chambermaids to the concierge, bellhop, spa staff and front-of-house team were great and really added to our stay. The concierge team were especially helpful, and coordinated the repair of some luggage which had been damaged by the airline in transit. The hotel is in the trendy Yorkville area of Toronto, and has a subway station (\"museum\" station) in the next block, just past the Royal Ontario Museum. You can get to the main financial area etc by subway within ten minutes. There are lots of very nice restaurants and high-end shops (Tiffany, Vera Wang etc) within walking distance. The hotel also has a towncar service in the mornings and evenings though we didn't use this. I've stayed in a lot of very nice hotels and this ranks among my best hotel experiences. I was very impressed by the Park Hyatt and I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for a top quality hotel stay in Toronto.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara Falls, Canada", "Title": "\u201c4th time staying\u201d", "Author": "1974sniper", "ReviewID": "UR101194137", "Content": "I travel to toronto for business ever few months park hyatt is always a great stay friendly staff clean rooms great decor, fair priced for toronto. front desk is truly there to help. will be staying there in 3 weeks for my next business trip", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeyond Exceptional\u201d", "Author": "green-machine-1969", "ReviewID": "UR100777200", "Content": "First, I must say that I've never written a review before but after this experience, I felt the need to contribute to the all of the excellent reviews.

We had light lunch and also enjoyed a few romantic late evening drinks. The food was terrific. The atmosphere is awesome. Stephanie, our server on both occasions is absolutely magnificent.

I expected the hotel to be top notch, like the Sofitel chain, or better, and I was not to be disappointed. This is the hotel where undoubtedly many of the rich, famous & powerful have stayed, whether it is for business reasons, or the Toronto Film Festival. Is the hotel pretentious and expensive? Well of course it is! But for the well-heeled (as opposed to the budget concious traveller like most average people) this hotel is probably \"run of the mill\". By saying that I am not knocking the hotel one bit. The north tower is particularly well-adorned with wood, marble and the like, not to mention chandliers and superior art work likely worth more than my car! The hotel lacks a pool but apparently has a world class spa, Stillwater, which unfortunately I had no time or an extra $300 to indulge in. (Check it out on the web, the spa looks amazing...) My room was a one bedroom suite with a separate dining room/living area in an adjacent room. I don't exactly know the price, but I suspect it was in the $400 plus range. Each \"room\" had a full bath, a sitting area and large screen LG LCD TV of approximately 42 inches in diameter (My guess). Yes, did I mention I had TWO large screen TV's! The room was suitably appointed, and the massive King Size bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, perhaps with the exception of my own. In other words, no complaints or concerns about the \"ginormous\" gorgeously appointed room, and especially about the service - from the concierge to the bell hops. My clients and I had dinner at the Annona restaurant situate inside the hotel - both on the night of our arrival and indeed, on the following night. On both nights I had Scallop based dishes, the first of which was salad based, and both of which were very tasty indeed. In fact, the scallops had to be the LARGEST scallops I had ever seen or been served in any restaurant ever. They were cooked to near perfection, and could be cut like \"butter\" with no dryness or sense or being overcooked. My company and I drank white wine (Penfold's Chardonnay) and local beer with our meals, all of which suited our dinners to a tee. The only disappointment with the meals was the \"chip like\" bread served with the meals, and also the regular bread and \"dips\". I can't even really describe it, but I have had better tasting and softer bread, AND fresh baked at far lesser restaurants - even East Side Marios! However, all other aspects of the meal were superb, so don't get me wrong. Annona is a very nice restaurant, including the decore and the service was very very good. At the conclusion of the meals (and my stay) I didn't get a chance to see the bills, but I was very grateful to my hosts for the opportunity to stay at this lovely hotel in a swanky part of Toronto I don't normally partake in. I have stayed at the Westin, the Royal York, the Sheraton, the Best Western, and Sutton Place in Toronto, but this property easily tops the list! I doubt I will ever return to this hotel (unless I win the lottery) but if you are looking for a high quality meal/dinner, and superior overnight accomodations you won't be disappointed in the Park Hyatt.

You have to park across the way on Cumberland St. at the Four Seasons - where the sign claims that the $38 fee is for overnight parking and that there is an additional daily max - which means it costs more than $38 to park there! Fortunately, there are 2 other garages on Cumberland. The 2nd one is cheaper - I parked there for a grand total of $63 CAN for a two night stay. For cheap coffee, there is a Tim Horton's nearby on Bloor just a few blocks to the west. And the coffee at the Whole Foods Market isn't bad either. Next time, I think I'll stay at the Yorkville Marriott on Bloor near Yonge St, because there were a lot of nice priced restaurants and some markets on Yonge.

First for the FYI's: 1. Some rooms have benefitted have a recent recarpet and some have not, so I'd request a fresher room. My first room had not been recarpeted and while the room was acceptable, it felt tired. The recarpeted rooms are much more pleasant. 2. If you are a light sleeper, exterior noise can be an issue, especially on weekends if you are on a lower floor and facing Avenue Road. Yorkville obviously draws young ultra-affluents and they enjoy playing with their Ferraris and Cayenne Turbos when they leave the clubs, resulting in loud and throaty exhaust notes penetrating some rooms. Highest floors furthest away from Bloor Street or Avenue Road are quietest. 3. The hotel's complimentary bicycle valet program is an excellent amenity and the Don Valley Trails and Toronto Islands make excellent destinations for riders, as does the downtown core on weekends when traffic is quite light. I've made more than 20 trips to Toronto and love both the city and area surrounding the hotel, and I agree with the general tone of the reviews. I found the level of service to be absolutely outstanding, although I didn't find the property to harmonize well in visual terms. In going from my room to breakfast for example, the room had one theme, the hallway another, the ground lobby a third, and the breakfast room yet a fourth, with none of them top-of-class or particularly complementary.

Without question, the rates can be pricey but the service and location are outstanding. If you look for deals you can find rates under $200/night. LOCATION: The location is within walking distance to the wonderfully chic Yorkville neighborhood, the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Toronto. If you are in the mood to walk it is also within walking distance to the CN Tower and West Queen - but it would be better to take a metro to those locations. ROOMS: We stayed in a standard king room in the north tower. There are two different towers at the hotel and both have rooms that appear to have been former apartments in size (around 400 sq feet) and structure (unique angles and corner windows). The rooms were quite comfortable, with bedding that is outstanding and marble bathrooms that are very high-quality. They offer a twice-daily housekeeping service and the rooms are sparkling clean. SERVICES: We ate in the hotel restaurant, enjoyed the top floor bar and utilized the gym. The gym has a standard collection of treadmills, free weights and a few other machines. While it is small, everything was quality. It clearly served its purpose. It is located right next to the award-winning spa, which is a great way to walk into the gym. The top floor bar is a must visit - enjoy their tapas-style food and the great view. The hotel restaurant left a bit to be desired. It is pretty expensive and you can do better by simply walking to eat into the Yorkville neighborhood. The in-room wireless Internet was reliable, fast and free. TIPS: If you are planning on seeing the standard attractions in Toronto you really can avoid renting a car. At $40/day for parking at the hotel you can save a lot by either taking a cab ($45 from airport) or using their car service ($75 from airport). We used the car service and it was punctual and upscale. We walked a block from the hotel to the subway stop at the Metro and for $3 each way were able to take a comfortable ride to the CN Tower, Rodgers Centre and other locations. Additionally, consider eating out in the neighborhoods as the food at the hotel is very expensive. We found local restaurants that were half the cost for breakfast and less expensive for lunch/dinner as well. Additionally, utilize the concierge. We had wonderful help from them (they will mail your postcards for free and rent a car which we needed for a day trip to Niagara Falls).

Watching the sunset on the patio with a glass of wine and my significant other was memorable. Everyone working at the hotel treated guests like royalty - I really cannot say enough good things about this hotel.

The hotel itself and its amenities are fantastic. I stayed in the newer tower and the rooms were spacious, clean and the showers were excellent. The Roof Lounge is phenomenal. Despite all this, both stays have involved staff being confrontational, rude and downright hostile. For the most part, the staff is as good as every other aspect of the hotel, but I find it more than simply coincidence that I have had two separate incidents with the staff. The most recent incident was simply astonishing. My party and I were running late for a particular event that was integral to our stay in the city when our elevator became stuck between floors. After requesting help through the intercom and receiving a brief response, we were left without any contact for approx. 10-15 minutes while we became increasingly more anxious. Finally, we were able to open the doors ourselves. Remembering that most elevators have a safety feature that will not allow the elevator to move while the doors are open, we simply exited and dropped 3 feet to the next floor. On the way out of the building, we were met by a hostile security guard. Rather than apologizing for our delay and lack of contact or assistance, he proceeded to insult and scold us for exiting the elevator in plain view of other guests, further delaying us while we stood in shock at this display. I could understand his position that we could have been hurt, but the onus was on him to provide assistance and instruction. This is simply unacceptable behavior inside of a supposed 5-star hotel and put a damper on what was otherwise an enjoyable stay.

Other issue is that none of the rooms including suites(contrary to what central reservations will tell you) have pull out couches.

So, we got our money's worth. The public areas of the hotel are very nice. We had a Park Deluxe King room in the new tower on an upper floor. Room was enormous, very clean, tasteful but a bit dated and not arranged very well. The sofa in the room had seen better days, with lots of staining and discoloration--totatlly unacceptable in a hotel of this class. TV was an old 27\" or 32\" CRT and ought to be upgraded to an HD flat panel if the hotel wants to be taken seriously as a 4+ star property.

Bathroom was lovely (shower head was perfectly fine--not sure what other are complaining about). The bathroom products provided (like shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, bath gel) were very nice and in very large quantity containers--perfect for enjoying back at home.

In the Deluxe (new) tower rooms a large and very comfortable. Most have a seating area, a deep soaking tub and larger bathroom. The rooms here have a black/gold motif. Given the choice stay here. The Suites: Suites are mostly oversized rooms, I have stayed in a few that had separate sitting areas which were small. Truthfully, unless you have a compelling need for a suite a deluxe (new tower) room will suffice. A few issues: Soundproofing is ok but not perfect. Some rooms get street noise, others hallway noises. Valet parking is $36 CAD a night plus taxes which is understandable but still high. The Stillwater Spa in the hotel is very busy and hard to get appointments at. When you do get in, the spa is often crowded and I found the massage services pretty ordinary to poor.

The rooms are lovely, the bathrooms are incredible, and the Yorkville location make this an unbeatable experience. And just to top it off the service is excellent as well. To be honest, I don't have anything negative to say about this hotel experience. The televisions are a bit old but apart from that I couldn't be happier. I stay at the Park Hyatt every time I visit Toronto for work and I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. A note, for those visitors who are not familiar with Toronto; the Park Hyatt is located in Yorkville which is a great nightlife and shopping district about 3 kilometers north of the financial district. So if you are coming in to Toronto for some work and you need to be downtown this might not be the best hotel for you, but if you like the uptown shopping experience than this is the neighborhood you need to be in. The location of the Park Hyatt is perfect. Also, be sure to book so that your stay includes breakfast, the restaurant on site has several tasty options. I hope that helps.

My main issue was with the service which was hit and miss (more miss than hit) eg.: 1. The second stay my husband and I ended up in a twin bed room, when we called to try and change rooms they could only offer us a king room in the old smoking tower. I was probably more annoyed that they did not mention this at check in even though we were both standing together whilst checking in. 2. I called conceirge at one stage to find out if Toronto had a particular shoe store. Conceirge said they had never heard of it and so there must not be one. In hotels of a this class I would have expected them to check the phone directory or online for me and get back to me. I later found out that while there was no store the shoes I was looking for were sold at a couple of shops - a quick check online would have told them this. Would I stay here again, probably as it was perfectly functional and we got a good rate but it was not a memorable hotel which I think Park Hyatts should be.

Let's talk about one stress I didn't need...We booked our room a year in advance and even called the week before to confirm our non-smoking King. Lo & behold, upon check-in - they can't find our original reservation and try sticking us with (2) double beds. Because that's what I really want on my wedding night - a separate bed and LOTS of sleep. First we got the, \"There's nothing we can do\" routine and after some wrangling & manager-talking - we got what I suspect WAS a smoking room, sprayed out with a queen size bed, in a 1 bedroom suite - in a sold-out hotel during a busy weekend, no extra charge. THANK GOD! Other then that bump - the Hyatt ROCKED and loses a star from me based on poor organization. Room - LOTS of space, double sink vanity - all marble baby! Largest bathroom amenities I have ever seen - practically full-size bottles! Comfy bed, two TVs and a nicely stocked mini-bar. I think we were in the 'older' south tower, but it felt clean and new. The north tower is newer and just as nice (we toured the rooms before our wedding). Room Service - One of the BEST and most comprehensive menus I've seen. I think the prices were fair and in comparison to a nice meal out. I had the Lobster Club Sandwich with Fries for around $20. The Breakfast - $20 & The Grilled cheese $15. Good times all around, fast service. Parking - Around $30/day for valet, but worth it for the in/out priviliges. If you're willing to walk - you can park on the U of T grounds for around $14/day - but not for 24 hrs. like at the Hyatt. Spa - The BEST in Toronto, hands down. ipod menu/playlist given to you before your treatment. Classy tea lounge, whirlpool, steam room, sauna. Pricey - $140 for 60 minute massage. I would definitely stay here again! They resolved my problem and the service level is what you expect from a 5-star hotel.

A cab downtown to the Canon Theatre (near the Eaton Centre) was $10 but considering parking fees and aggravation, was well worth it.
