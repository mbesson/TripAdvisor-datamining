Actually had a strip of steel across the centers on all windows including the bathroom and they were riveted not screwed together. The only way out of a window would be to break the glass. We were on the highest floor (4th) and could not understand why. When I ask the desk clerk he seemed to act as if not to understand my question. Hotel was not clean. When the cleaner came to do the room he did replace the sheets, but did not clean the wood floor. If you have any lung problems this place would make it worse. Old tv, broken furniture and a/c that was filthy and did not cool. Most everything in the room needed some kind of repair or cleaning. Would not stay there again. The price was $507 Sin Dollar or $393 US for 3 nights. Not a bargain at all.

You can't tell by the photos but the flooring is all lino not carpet. And don't be fooled by the photo's this place is very run down and dirty. We had to ask to fix our toilet, the fridge didn't work, faulty power point (the cleaner/fix it man just told us to wiggle the plug around to make it work), the air con barely works, and the smell of the place was BAD like old cigarettes, damp mustiness, mixed with cheap cologne. In 1 of the rooms, old rubbish was found in the wardrobe and a pair of undies in the back of the couch. And when we checked under the beds (to see if anything had fallen under) upon leaving all we found was 5mm deep of dust underneath them. You can\u2019t open your windows as they have been riveted shut. The odor was so bad that we had to re-wash our clean clothes again to get the smell out of them. Bathroom was filled with mold roof to shower curtain because of lack of ventilation. Beds are very firm and the mattress covering is made of vinyl. There is no mattress protector so the one sheet you sleep on keeps sliding up and all i could think of was who had sleep on it before me? As i could only assume that the mattress was not cleaned and wiped before our use. If you want to go to the zoo, china town etc spend I little bit more money and go into town where there is organized tours, as what you save in accommodation here you will spend on transport. The pool was only 1 meter deep but enough to cool you down. Not even a stop over will get us to stay here again. The owners need to start spending money here to bring its standard back up; this place is VERY run down. Had i found their dossier sooner i would've taken up their money back guarantee of - \"if you are not happy within 15 minutes of check in - you will get a refund\". The dossier was not out to be found immediately it was stored in a draw - found on the second day of our stay.
