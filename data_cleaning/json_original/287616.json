I don't think that anyone ever taught him that, \"Less is more,\" when it comes to explaining mundane details. Hey, Buddy: Just send the email confirmation it will have all that fine print on it... and just cause you explain doesn't mean that (the rather dense person on the other end of the phone who thinks he's the only person in the world who calls that hotel) will understand it either. Anyway, after no apology for my wait, (and not seeming to understand that I'm three hours ahead of you in my body so will you please hurry up) I was given the hurry up and brush off to my room. The rooms themselves are in a seperate building from the main guest house with the desk/exercise facility/common areas/business center, etc., and on a rather chilly December for Vegas, it was quite a trek to get across the courtyard to my room. I normally wouldn't feel very secure here because there is nothing stopping anyone from approaching you from the street while walking to or from your room. It seemed as if the area was problem free enough, but you never know these days. I wouldn't choose this place if I was a female business traveler travelling alone. But I was tired and didn't care and was more annoyed by the fact that it started raining while I was walking outside. Rain in the desert, what are the odds... I digress. The room itself was a plenty roomy 1 bedroom in the standard Residence Inn style, but this one had nice granite countertops and very comfy furniture. There were a few issues with caulking that had worn away in the tub and a couple of stray hairs on the bathroom floor(probably from the housekeeper), but that is a minor detail (the average person loses 1,000 hairs a day from their head) and the bed linens were spectacularly white. The TV in the bedroom could not tune in channels 2, 3, 4, or 5 clearly and normally would have been a problem except in my head it was past midnight, but only 9:30 Vegas time. Breakfast was below average because of several reasons. Most all limited service off some kind of hot item on their breakfast just to compete nowadayz. Residence Inn has made their rep by having more items and fuller breakfast, but I much rather have quality food and better presentation than quantity. First off the atmostphere was, meh. They used styrofoam plates and plastic ware instead of china and silverware like most Residence Inns, and besides, with Marriott's latest green efforts, they should be doing better. The eggs were too dry, like they were made hours ago, and the bacon was too salty. There was only one waffle maker so the line was long and people gave up and went to get other items. On the good side though, fresh fruit selection was excellent and so was yogurt selection. There were three cold cereals to choose from and they had fresh oatmeal with brown sugar and at least two diffrent nuts to choose from as add ins. Breads selection was fine. Coffee was available 24 hours in a nice conspicuous place and they also offered hot water for Bigelow teas or Nestl\u00e9 hot cocoa. Business center wait in the evening was atrocious. Every time I came down (which was a trek) there were some of the local, ultra blue collar (see guy who needs a serious shave who's clothes resemble somone who is homeless looking at pictures on MySpace of girls in bikinis showing off their stretch marks next to montster trucks covered in mud) residents on Facebook, MySpace, Email, etc, doing no serious work. The front desk person seemed to be in no hurry to dismiss people who had been on there for hours! When finally it freed up around midnight (because everyone went to bed and the auditor apparently will enforce the 30 minute timeline if someone is waiting) the connection was terrible. The main reason being is that it is NOT a hardwired connection but a desktop WIRELESS connection that's connected to the network that EVERY other computer in the hotel is connected to (and that's a LOT of connectivity!) The convenience store selection was average, prices were average for a C-store in a tourist trap, but the large ice cream cooler full of Good Humor gave them a huge plus in my book. In addition, the water out of there was plenty cold! Day service was, well, like night and day. The day staff was so pleasant, easy to converse with and went the extra mile to make sure our requests could be taken care of. Thus I can see the hotel service improving drastically if their evening service improves (and they put at least two people in the front office on a sold out night.) Their shuttle service is convenient and their drivers are keen on recommendations. The first driver we had was more friendly and talkative. On the ride to the strip from the hotel we saw that there was an In and Out less than a mile away, and across the street, a Jack in the Box (both of which do not exist in Indianapolis, yet.) All the above minor service issues withstanding, I would stay there again if I was here on business and wanted to rent a car just because of location away from Vegas distractions, but not too far that you can go and enjoy them easily.

The Residence Inn does not offer room service but we found 2 menu's from 2 different restaurants, one of which is highly recommended by the staff. DO NOT order from the Mama Mia's menu. It was horrible and I will be writing about it in a follow on review. The staff apologized the next day when I complained and said the Mama Mia's restaurant staff sneaks into the hotel and places their menu under the doors.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "middletown,in", "Title": "\u201cvery comfortable\u201d", "Author": "sgmcneil", "ReviewID": "UR47278700", "Content": "We have stayed here several times and everything is clean and we enjoy the breakfast buffet.

We checked out early in the morning after our first night and moved to the Residence Inn Green Valley, which was a huge improvement. When we checked into our room at Residence Inn South, we found a note on the counter from the housekeeping service, to a prior guest, stating the room was not made up due to the \"privacy\" sign on the door. Obviously someone had made up the room, because the bed was made etc., but they had not cleaned well (as evidence by the housekeeping note still being on the counter) and the carpet had not been thoroughly vaccumed. When we went into the bathroom, their was hair on the tub and the floor. Yikes. I hate a dirty bathroom! It turns my stomach to check into a room with an unclean bathroom. We called the front desk and the staff person apologized and immediately moved us to another and larger room, which was appreciated. However, we still found the room in general to look worn and give an appearance of not being very clean (due to the worn nature of the carpet , tile around the tub etc.) I was then waiting iniside the building door where our room was located, for my daughter to come from her car into the building. A group of four people (two couples) who were guests, entered the door with their key, looked at me and called me a \"dumb [--].\" I had not spoken to them and was simply standing in the entry way. I reported the incident and requested security take some extra strolls through our building. The staff person whom I spoke with told me he would inform the manager but we never had a responsive call from the manager. We shortly realized that this hotel was located in an area where we could not walk around to restaurants or shops. The nearest grocery store, per the front desk, was an 8 minute drive. There were no restaurants or shops around. The hotel is located on what was previously known as \"Industrial Drive\" and it definitely is in a more industrial location, even though you can see the strip from the hotel. The breakfast area is very small, about half the size of the normal Residence Inn. It made it very \"tight\" seating in the morning. We also inquired of the front desk if they had a cork screw to open a bottle of wine we had purchased. The staff person was very polite and informed us there was not one anywhere in the hotel but he could call the Court Yard hotel next door and have one brought over but it would take 20 minutes. After 30 minutes we called again and were told the Court Yard hadn't yet responded. We gave up. We found this just wasn't the right place for what we were looking for. We moved over to the Residence Inn Green Valley and loved it. The staff at Residence Inn South were all polite and friendly, but the location and housekeeping in the hotel were poor.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGood but over-ranked on tripadvisor\u201d", "Author": "Hiker30", "ReviewID": "UR23769103", "Content": "I stay at a lot of Marriott properties all over the world (platinum rewards member). I like Marriott because there is always a minimum level of comfort I've come to expect no matter where I stay.

The location is not on the Strip, but is convenient to get there by car or the hotel shuttle. The room I had was a standard Residence Inn studio king, in fact it was an exact replica of the layout I've seen at other Residence Inns and it was nice. The front desk staff were nice and the hotel breakfast was above average for a Residence Inn (eggs, potatoes, do-it-yourself breakfast burritos, and the usual fruit and breads). The area was quiet at night, and there is no casino on site so the hotel really does \"sleep\" late at night. CONS: The room I had was not as clean as it should have been. Hairs scattered around the bathroom floor and tub, and the toilet seat was...not shiny. The bed was much firmer than I expected, I didn't sleep well.

But this was the stay from HELL! I was driving my 91 year old mother from Boise, ID to San Diego to visit family for Christmas. We had a two room suite. At about 10 pm I got into bed. A few minutes later I saw a small black bug on my pillow. Thinking it might be a spider I just flicked it away. A few minutes later I felt a bite on my shoulder and brushed by hand across the spot. A larger black bug hit the sheet next to be, burst open and left a spatter of my blood on the sheet. As I was jumping out of bed a second bite happened and I did the same thing with the same result, another bug and a blood spot on the sheet.. Once I was out of bed I was able to see many of these vile creatures on the white sheets. Because of their size I thought they were ticks and only learned that they were not when I had them inspected by a lab in Boise on my return. They confirmed that they were in fact bed bugs and that they did exist in that size. The only good news was that I was not exposed to any disease. That night, I called the office and told them to find me another suite. I had to wake my sleeping mother and move all of our stuff to another room and even after taking a shower still felt itchy. I inspected the sheets in the new room and found nothing but I remained itchy for several days, in spite of showering twice a day. I find it amazing that a hotel of this supposed quality would have bed bugs! I have never experienced this before, anywhere! It was a really gross experience and needless to say, I would not stay at this hotel again. I was told by the inspecting lab here in Boise that the only way to get rid of them was to do a massive extermination, and I don't know if this was done after I left. My massive, they meant the entire hotel, not just the room. I was also told to check my luggage, and bedding at home, very carefully, because I may have brought them home with me. Fortunately thid did not happen, but I could have been exposed to these bugs and worse, my mother may have brought them back to her retirement home and infected that whole place. This is inexcusable. I will never get into bed in a hotel without first checking the bedding VERY, VERY carefully.

The free buffet breakfast was great. I highly recommend this place to anyone. It was quiet and clean. I do have to agree with a previous reviewer regarding the shuttle. The shuttle does drop you off at Mandalay Bay and I believe the MGM. However, it stops at 11:00PM, but you can always take a taxi back to the hotel. It is a great perk but I am not a shuttle person. I am too independant and don't like to wait. If you aren't planning on drinking heavily than take your own car. ALL the major hotels on the strip have FREE parking gargages in the back of each hotel.
