I chose it for the location and for it's cheapness. I suppose the price should have been an indication of the quality to be expected. The staff were pleasant enough though, so no complaints there. We were situated in a double room on the top floor. The ceiling, curtains and walls had dirty marks. The bed was awful, very hard with springs that must have been broken. In the bathroom the cold water tap ran warm. The worst came in the morning when we were awoken from the sound of what would seem to be all the water pipes in the building running through our bathroom. The noise went on for quite a while as obviously other guests were using the showers in their rooms. Needless to say we made sure we made a swift exit after that.

We got a great deal on this prime location hotel by using the Trivargo website but our main priority was a hotel in a great location with a clean and quiet room (which is exactly what we got!). This hotel is 2 minutes away from Paddington tube station and around the corner from lots of pubs and restaurants. All of the staff are friendly and we got lots of smiles and hello's from people that work here. A special mention must go to Francis and Lucica who worked on the reception desk. I think Francis is a duty manager. Both these members of staff were very helpful, friendly and professional in there approach. It was my partners birthday and I put this in the booking and both members of staff wished him happy birthday. Needless to say, the little fuss put a smile on my partners face! When booking the room I asked for a quiet room and we were even given a choice of viewing 2 rooms to choose from. This was very unexpected and very welcome. We chose room 404 and had a good nights sleep which when considering the location was surprising. The hotel could definitely do with a refurb as I think it has a lot of potential. It's location and staff are it's strong points. There is no lift here but that was not a problem as I was expecting that from reading tripadvisor. To conclude - this hotel is clearly not The Ritz but if you are looking for a clean and reasonably priced BASE to explore London then look no further.

The website showed lovely pictures and the description said all rooms had dvd player, tea and coffee making facilities, a desk and a hairdryer.Also said it had been refurbished. Well it has had a lick of paint here and there but that is about all. We were in room 614 and it was up many flights of narrow stairs. There was no working light at night to guide you up those stairs. The room was the smallest we have ever stayed in, but for one night we thought it would be ok. You could just about move around the edge of the bed if you touched the wall. The top bed cover was dirty but they did do pretty swan shapes for the two towels. The very tiny tv was hanging on a not very safe wall hanger. There was no DVD, No hairdryer and no tea and cofee facilities. They said they would put the tea and coffee facilities in the room and we trusted them but when we got home quite late the staff had changed. We found a tiny travel kettle that had not been tested for safety, two flimsy plastic cups that are meant only for cold drinks, some stolen sugars from Mcdonalds, two out of date coffee granule packets and worst of all two dirty possibly used teabags in an old used paper bowl. No milk and the night staff were not interested in helping us and said they never provide milk. The bedroom window had a huge broken piece of glass in it and we were scared it would fall on to us. The shower did fall on to us several times whilst we were showering as it was not secured to the wall. Don't get me wrong we were staying in a fully refurbished room as far as the staff were concerened and we could smell the fresh paint and see evidence of painting on the floor. Just a shabby and quick job was done though. For one night we managed but when we spoke to the hotel they were not interested in our concerns and to date they still have not addressed our complaint. We chose this room as a birthday surprise and it was ruined as it was such a bad experience. When we checked in we spoke to the reception man, a charming indian guy, who assured us that all the previous bad reviews had been addressed and that all would be fine for us, this was before he took our payment in full. We should have seen the room before we paid and we say to all readers of this, SEE ROOM FIRST DO NOT PAY THEN VIEW ROOM. It is posisble that they do have a couple of decent rooms that they keep for such people. We spoke to booking.com before we checked in and they said they had spoken to the hotel to check that all the facilities would be in the room. The hotel denied having this conversation and blamed booking.com for putting the wrong information on their website. Booking.com clearly say it is the hotel who is responsible for the information listed. We believe booking.com but that has not helped us as nobody is taking the blame.

We invariably book budget accommodations so that we can use our finances to enjoy the sites and attractions. During our most recent trip, we visited many cities in England, Ireland and Scotland. Every hotel we booked met or exceeded our expectations both in terms of amenities and location. The Warwick, however, was truly atrocious and we had to move after one night of a planned six night stay. The reception area is, in fact, three desks jammed together in a small area manned by an combination of receptionists and employment counselors (honestly!). I had prepaid for one night, and the receptionists insisted we pay for the rest of the stay up front. When I presented my credit card, she stated she would have to add three percent to our bill. Instead, I paid her all of the cash I had at the time (84 GPB) and then went up to our \"room\". It was a laughably small room with contained the most decrepit BUNK-BED I had ever seen. It had no towels, no TV, no toiletries, and no area to store anything. The toilet was abysmal and smelled. I immediately returned to reception and met with a different young lady who was most sympathetic and admitted she was anticipating my complaints. She helpfully moved us across the hall to an equally small room, this time with a reasonable double bed, but still no TV or any other amenities. Overnight, she checked around to find us alternate accommodation and was very pleasant. We elected to not take advantage of her findings, and instead went next door to the Tudor Hotel, which was infinitely better, albeit more expensive. Upon returning to the Warwick to collect a refund, we were surprised to learn that they deducted two nights from the cash because, to quote the young lady, \"the booking agent on the internet takes the entire first night charge as their fee.\". Total rubbish! To put our review into perspective, we have never recommended that fellow travelers avoid any hotel in which we have stayed. This dump is a refuge for young students who can afford nothing else. On the bright side, it is ideally located on Norfolk Square 100 metres from Paddinton Station.

The room was tiny and very marked up. The curtains and carpets had not been cleaned (not even vaccuumed) in a very long time (don't look at the top of the baseboards). The bed was very uncomfortable and you could feel every spring. The toilet seat was broken and the light above the sink did not work. (difficult to shave in the semi-dark) The requests for repairs were completely ignored. The bed was obviously tossed together in a hurry each day and the sheets never changed in the 8 days. Not a big deal for us but just to let everyone know what to expect! The breakfast included not very good coffee, (never tried the tea) cold cereal and your choice of croissant or toast.

There was a thick layer of dust in the furniture and the cup in the toothbrush holder in the bathroom was caked with paste. Even the tiny soap bar had dirt on it. The soap dish was coming off the wall, the curtain could not be opened and was black and stained, and the walls were paper thing. Most disturbing, the staff insisted on cash payments for rooms even though a sign clearly says they accept credit cards. They were not friendly at all, there is no clear reservation system, and the hallways are littered with luggage--the same bags for days, you have to walk over some to get to the rooms. This place was disgusting, it did not feel safe at all, and I was very uncomfortable. Better to spend a few pounds more on a decent room anywhere else, a room that is not filthy in a place that does not make you nervous.
