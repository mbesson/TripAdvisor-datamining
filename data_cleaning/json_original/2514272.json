I paid 100 pounds for 2 nights. I'm fine with the tiny room. However, the sink was falling apart. The floor squeaked when I stepped on it. The woman at the reception was rude. When I asked for the WIFI password, she ignored me and carried on chatting on the phone. I waited at the reception till she was done and she gave me a piece of paper with the password and asked me to \"sort it out\" myself. By the way, it was the wrong password. She told me off when I looked at the brochures in front of the reception. She said \"Hey, I'm talking to you, give me the room keys before you go out!\" This hotel may be a short walk away from the tube but there are many more around the area. I've stayed in other hotels in London and I could get other cheaper and better options.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lecce", "Title": "\u201cWhy all this hate?\u201d", "Author": "LecceFabio", "ReviewID": "UR115642084", "Content": "As a young man coming from a hostel, I didn't want to get into a Ritz Hotel.

The rooms are very small and the beds are not comfortable. The bathroom was obviously not cleaned before we checked in - there was a used shampoo packet and a hair rubber band on the ground. The worst part, however, was that we returned from a play in the West End to get in and the front door was locked. The key doesn't open the front door, just the room. I had to ring the bell and wake up the hotel \"landlord\" (there is no real front desk) to let us in. How much does it really cost to change the lock on the front door?

The room we were in was very small the only extra apart from the bedding was one small towel between two and liquid soap in the bijou ensuite. Our credit card was whisked away which still worries us although the bill was OK. There was a TV in the room precariously placed and with reception so poor you couldn't watch it. (Hasn't London gone digital yet?) I was glad we travelled light as there was so little space and I wouldn't want to carry a heavy case up the steep stairs. When I enquired about the tea and coffee I was directed to a small kitchen & told to help myself. One look was enough, we decided to forego the coffee! The only plus was the location, close to Earls Court underground and within easy walking distance of the Museums.

On top of that you leave your room keys with them and when I came and went I constantly was being given wrong keys which made going up and down from reception and being looked at like I was a nuisance when it was their error every time. On top of that bathroom was dirty, the maid decided to empty a plastic bag I had in the room with my stuff in it and use it as a trash bag and leave it for me, and a window was left open by the maid so bugs were in there from the trash cans outside my window.

The situation was rather tense. The police eventually arrived and took stock of the situation and examined our room. They pointed out to the manager that the room was in violation of building codes and agreed that the manager should refund the balance of our bill -- she still refused claiming that it was not technically possible and that she'd offered us another room and we refused it. We had no choice but to leave this hotel without any refund. This hotel is completely innapropriate and we feel that we have been robbed by its staff.
