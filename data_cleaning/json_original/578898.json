Ours had a bath with a shower head attached to the mixer tap. The other room had a proper shower and this smelt OK. The large room had a small room leading off it with seats and a table, which led onto a small balcony, which you could fall off into the garden below as there was no barrier. Even more dangerous than the steep stairs up to the rooms. There was a safe in the large room, but this was a joke as it was not fixed to anything! We did leave our passports in the room in our bags and luckily they were still there at the end of our stay. The bedrooms had badly fitted laminate flooring and bathrooms tiles. Some friend in other rooms, on different floors said they had old carpets, so I suppose we were lucky.

That being said overall a relatively good value for money given the location and compared to pensioner alternatives. 10-20% overpriced, considering: Negatives: Small room- ours was in the attic, with one leg of the bed missing (only affects anything if you plan to curl into a ball at the bottom end of the bed), no soap the first day but shampoo and body wash packets were present. The attic shower room was atrocious and could definitely scare some people. It was 3 meters long and built into the size of the attic (one side sloped in), only with one light and completely tiled so a bit like an insane asylum. Toilet room: all white, clean, soap, and toilet paper stocked...there WAS a bit of mold/gunk on the ground but it was a small puddle the size of a wallet maybe from a dipping heating pipe, and in the very corner of the room. NOT something to go crazy over. Simple breakfast Positives: good towels, and linen quality, nicely arranged room for its size; two guys for three days worked fine in there. Shower room: clean and acceptable/good water pressure, Toilet room: clean. Breakfast is NOT bad. Simple yes. The internet services the same room you have breakfast in and is open 24 hours per day. High speed wireless connection but no privacy if you want to use internet calling as the doorman is situated into this room a bit. Very helpful staff, if a bit limited on English skills. German fluency would help, or obviously being from the Netherlands too. Showed where to go, advised critically how to get out of the city in time for our flight given the fact that Queensday madness would limit our ability to move through the city Breakfast Includes boiled eggs, white/wheat toast, jams/jellies/peanut butter, ham and cheese slices, and fresh milk, orange juice (from concentrate), water for tea and I must say very good coffee. Location is exactly 25 minutes from central station walking at a brisk pace through light crowds. Tram number 9 (from the middle of the central station, not the right side when you walk out from your trains!! - caution) is 1.60 euro and takes only four stops to Rembrandtplein (plaza/square). Hotel thorbecke is just off square, and I mean just off you cannot miss it if you walk straight from the tram stop to the south more. Final notes: there is a nightclub that queue's up in front of the entrance to hotel about 11 pm. Thorbecke sign is on about floor 2 of the building. Young crowds will fare better here. The door problem that others gripe about has been solved. It slams after you walk in :) As of April 2009, I Amsterdam sign is at the WTC plaza on the southern side of The South Central Station", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Helens, UK", "Title": "\u201cReasonable Budget Accomodation\u201d", "Author": "lambelafloors", "ReviewID": "UR28140549", "Content": "After reading the other reviews I must admit I was a bit sceptical but upon arrival at the hotel I was pleasantly surprised.

It were also very grubby, stuff splattered on the walls, the walls in the room were not even painted and looked like a proper rush job.
