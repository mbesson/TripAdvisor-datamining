This was our first trip to Paris and our flight arrived early in the monirng. As we were travelling with a baby, we decided to go directly to the hotel. The hotel was fully booked and our room was not available immediately. However, the receptionist informed us that we had been upgraded to the Executive floor which had access to the Executive Lounge where we had breakfast. A couple of hours later, we were informed that no rooms were available on the Executive floor so they temporarily moved us to the normal floor. The view and the room was good and we slept in for a while before they moved us to the Executive Room which was not as nice as the Regular room but atleast we had access to the Lounge. Overall the hotel was great, the service - fantastic, the staff - polite and amenities - top of the line. We were celebrating my brother's 30th birthday and the hotel arranged complimentary champagne in our room along with a birthday cake. The hotel really treats their guests well. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Paris, although a wee bit expensive it is totaly worth it.

We were upgraded to a suite (awesome to have 2 bathrooms) and had executive level access. The team in the executive lounge were extraordinary. When I mentioned it was my Mom's birthday I think it kicked off the perks. 3 times we were sent champagne and chocolates..they would ask her about her day and her experiences... she told me she felt like a 'rock star.' The rooms really are nice and kept quite clean by a staff with excellent attention to details. Is it super modern decor? No, but the art deco look fits with the hotel and Paris. I think my Mom's only complaint was the distance. It may be a 10 minute walk for some, but for her it was about 15 minutes to the Arc (she is 70, after all!). Also, there aren't a ton of options in that direct neighborhood for food, drinks, etc, so plan accordingly.

Upon arrival customer service is a top ten. Like a good first date, a very good impression. Beyond the first impression, customer service declined. Not only did they place us in a room where the AC didn't work, but there was a major wet spot (either from previous flooding or whatever) in the front of the bathroom door that never went away. The use of the executive lounge was a plus, BUT the guy who worked at the desk up there gave mediocre customer service accompanied with major mis-communication with the folks at the front desk/concierge. We asked him how/where to purchase the Museum Pass. He told us we could down stairs. When we went down stairs they said, \"oh, we don't sell the Museum pass.....\" and the red headed woman at customer service/concierge was rude and acted as though we were disturbing her. Rather than her helping us, she quickly rushed us off. Hilton, this is sh*tty customer service. Also, Hilton you should be sure your rooms are prepared for customers. I was glad to find that the light bulb over the bath was fixed, but why did they ignore the massive wet spot on the rug? Why do half the job to ensure proper customer service?!? To top if off, when we were leaving, the gal at customer service nicely greeted us....um, she greeted us four days prior with the same speech. While it was a nice speech the first time around, her second time around it seemed like a prepared speech, words with less meaning. And since we where there to receive the same prepared speech twice, we can truly note that the speech and actions of customer service do not balance. Also, the fact that she greeted us while we were actually LEAVING was odd. It would have been better had she asked us about our stay, even after we pointed out to her that we were leaving and she already greeted us four days prior. Don't recall her name, Virginia perhaps.

We booked via lastminute.com as a secret hotel and paid around a third of the rack rate. (~\u00c2\u00a3430 for 4 nights). Staff were all very friendly and said Bonjour/Bonsoir on passing in the corridor (we saw the staff very little as we were Room Only and out sightseeing from 9am til about 9pm everyday). The room itself was a good size - bed extremely comfortable - the bathroom was AMAZING, all green marble, big bath and shower, free toiletries and towels changed every day. The hotel does not really have any views of the Arc de Triomphe (maybe the top floor does ?), its a fair 6/7 minute walk to the AdT but come on its close enough! The hotel is in a very safe area - lots of other 4*/5* hotels and various embassies and business headquarters, Parc Monceau nearby is lovely and a great place to grab a pastry for breakfast before getting the metro at Monceau. Few gripes: - the hotel on lastminute.com was listed as room only with a patio - we did not have a patio with room 139 - reading some other reviews it seems that guests were given a few little 'extra' perks when they had special occasions, upon booking I told the hotel we had a birthday on one of the days we stayed there however there was no extra treatment - maybe its because we booked it at a large discount to the standard rate...who knows !? I'm sure people booking directly with Hilton would have received some of these 'extras'..... - NO FREE WIFI !! For a 4* hotel this was very surprising, Wifi was available but ridiculously expensive (I think maybe \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.50 for 60 mins or over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 for 24 hours access) - Breakfast was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 per person each day, as we were Room Only we were considering getting breakfast at the hotel, however \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 a day for 2 people to eat breakfast was extreme to say the least - swerve breakfast at the hotel and grab a Pain au Chocolat/Coissant from Pacr Monceau instead All in all a very pleasant experience and good value - would happily stay there again (if its discounted!)

The retro design theme makes it look good (not stunning but interesting a coherent look). Maybe the design focus has got in the way of attending to practical details. Just look at a few good things about the hotel to see how they could be better. Th gym / healthclub is actually very good by hotel standards: an advanced Technogym KInesis cable machine, six machines, three treadmills and four other pieces of cardio equipment. There is a decent selection of freeweights too. However, getting into it is very frustrating. My room key wouldn't open the door -- this is a frequent problem apparently. They gave me a second key just for the gym but it de-activates itself every day. You have to add 15 minutes to every workout to allow for a side trip u[stairs to reception. The rooms are pleasing with some genuinely nice retro style furniture but only one spare electric outlet in the whole room. Clearly, the design ethos doesn't permit a much-needed extension cable. The decision about curtains in the rooms is truly bizarre: most of the rooms overlook a courtyard and so face another room which is about 15 metres away. Despite this, there are only net curtains. I'm not very prudish but I was concerned to see a gentleman across the courtyard, sitting at the desk next to the window in his underwear and a little over-stimulated by whatever was on his screen. He wasn't an exhibitionist: he was sitting behind the net curtains but clearly visible with the lights on The temperature control in the rooms is also apparently part of the decor: whether you turn it to maximum or minimum, the temperature stay s at 22 degrees C -- a little chilly for the man looking at the computer in his underwear. The internet is fast although very expensive if you're not gold or diamond. One evening, though, I had to call the i-Bahn service centre to get logged on as the re-direction page had crashed. It was sorted out but it took another 15 minutes. Most of the service was ok but there were no cups or mugs in my room when I arrived (the kettle and tea and coffee supplies were where they should have been). It took an hour to deliver them.

We booked a twin bathroom King Deluxe Suite and even though we had to remind the front desk about at extra bed they mobilized housekeeping who prepared everything in minutes. Breakfast for 5 is more suitable downstairs than in the Executive lounge, and again space prevails. Breakfast staff were easy going, welcoming and efficient.

I travel weekly in the states on business and have to say I liked everything about the Hilton Arc de Triomphe including: The staff - super nice and helpful in planning our sight seeing tour. The location - 15 minute walk to the Arc de Triumph and even closer to the metro. We purchased a 2 day metro pass for everyone and used it extensively. The subway felt safe and was a very convenient way to get around to all of the sights in Paris. The rooms - very clean, modern, and the same size as you would expect in the US.

A few tips: Buy the museum pass (unless your kids are 17 or under - they get in for free). Get a metro pass. A taxi cost us 60 Euro (for 4 of us) from CDG. The bus or train would have cost about as much and been less convenient. Get your Eiffel Tower tickets on line. In case you don't know, it's lit up at night and \"sparkles\" on the hour after dark (really a sight to see). If you want to eat dinner at the top, you need to make reservations way (months) in advance and I hear it's super expensive.

The hotel itself is in a great location - the nearest Metro station is a short walk away, but you are also within walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. The one downside with the location was that there weren't any great restaurants in the immediate area, but there's certainly no shortage of other amazing restaurants in Paris! The hotel itself is beautiful! We were on the Club Level and the rooms were clean and spacious. The rooms did have internet access (we are Hilton Honors members and were given free access) but we struggled to get it to work, and eventually gave up. Our room had a lovely little balcony, which was fairly useless in February but would be great in the summer to sit out with a glass of wine! The staff were all friendly and helpful, and all spoke perfect English! The Club Lounge seemed a good size, but it was often crowded and some guests had to stand to eat. Breakfast was a typical continental breakfast with some hot items like eggs and bacon.

Staff entered the room on two separate occassions without knocking / ringing the doorbell, which was surprising. The other big letdown was the location.

First impressions were good, hotel located in a nice residential area a short walk from the Metro and the Arc de Triomphe was comfortably reached in a 15 -20 minute walk. At check in we opted to accept the offer of an upgrade to access to the executive floor lounge for breakfast and snacks/drinks in the evening. Unfortunately, by upgrading this meant my wife was not allowed access to the spa facilities without an additional payment (it would have been complimentary on our original rate). When raised with the front desk staff the 'best' they could do was a 15 euro additional charge per session or offer a deal next time we stayed. I would recommend that you review, and clarify completely, the actual facilities offered if you decide to upgrade at the last minute. Rather than wasting further time arguing our point, which we felt was a fair one (considering all my wife wanted was a 20-30 minute session in the sauna), we decided to get on with our break and think very carefully about staying at this hotel again. The actual room was OK for a large city, not the largest, but serviceable. There was an iron, board and kettle in the room - this doesn't show on the hotel website and may not be available in all rooms. The room faced the courtyard, it was very quiet. The hotel was full on Saturday evening, despite this it remained very peaceful and we were not disturbed by noise from the corridors. Executive lounge staff were helpful and polite, a separate check in was available. I did get busy at times. The food was OK for a short stay. Breakfast was good for the cold selection, hot food was limited in choice and the same each day. Evening snacks, OK but very similar each evening would get tiresome for a long stay. The complimentary drinks selection was reasonable. Given the time over I think the 300 euro we spent for access over three days would have been more wisely spent in local a local cafe and a bar or two if on a holiday break. On business, the convenience would probably make it worthwhile - wifi is not free though. I travel relatively frequently on business and like to give a fair opinion of my stays in hotels. Therefore, on the whole, this is a nice hotel.

The room was a bit small, but very clean and well appointed as was the hotel lobby, restaurant and Executive lounge. We were very impressed by the Executive lounge roominess and its breakfast foods, snacks and drinks all day, including spirits, wine and beer. The fresh breads were great, along with the chocolate candies at 9:00 pm every night. We enjoyed the free Wifi also in the lounge, but would have liked to have the wifi access in our room also. But we made the best of it every night, by unwinding in the lounge after a hectic day of touring. The hotel is within blocks of Champs Elysee and Arc de Triomphe which made it easy to walk around. Also since we were there before the holidays we enjoyed all the Christmas markets and Christmas lights everywhere. I would also like to commend the excellent service we received from all the hotel employees, especially the Concierge, Executive lounge and front desk employees.

I've stayed here previously a few times as well so I can say that I have some experience with this hotel over the last few years as well as many other hotels for comparison sake. The Hilton Arc de Triomphe is not fancy or pretentious which fits me just fine. It's clean, the amenities are great and the staff wonderfully helpful, as many others have noted. If you're an American in Paris for business or on vacation and would prefer some of the comforts of home, then this hotel is for you. Some reviewers have mentioned that the toilet is in the bathroom... that's very American. Having a toilet in a separate closet is a very European thing and you have to decide what you prefer. I'm of the former camp. If you're an elite member and can qualify for the executive lounge or have a room that allows you access, then breakfast is included and it's a nice variety. However, the same hot entrees of scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon gets old after a bit. In the evenings there's refreshments (wines, champagne, beer, soft drinks and assorted appetizers & snacks) and that's always welcome before heading out to dinner. The location is pretty convenient. Close enough to the Champs Elysees but just off enough that it's not loud and crazy all the time. The hotel however, is not without its fault. Some like the art deco look. I hate it. Ok, hate may be too strong a word but to me it's not \"timeless\" as others have described. It looks dated to me and some of the elements of the design makes the hotel look a lot older, dark & uninviting. Although it's very well maintained, I prefer something more modern, bright & cheerful. Elegant chic if I may call it that. I've seen that enough at other high end hotels that I know my preference. Other gripes include no wireless internet in the rooms which is a huge pain since most of us are on iPhones/iPads or on a notebook that we'd rather use in our beds rather than tied to the desk. Internet is included for elite Hilton members so at least that's a plus but having to go to the lounge or the lobby when I want to use my iPhone/iPad is a chore. Others have pointed out the sewer smell in the lifts & lift lobbies. This has not gone away and have not been solved permanently by the building engineers. I've smelled it in all of my recent visits for at least a few days and it's nasty. The past few days have been pretty decent though. I don't know why it's so hard to resolve that one. I also don't like the inconsistencies from room to room. For example, some rooms have a separate shower & tub (my preference) and other rooms just have a tub with a piece of glass at one end where you can take a shower with water going all over (very French & I hate this type of rooms). I wish there was a way to make all the rooms similar. Americans would be driven crazy by the latter rooms while French guests would be more than fine with the former so I don't know why Hilton won't just make it consistent and give each room separate tubs & showers. Also, many rooms do not have a 110v outlet in the bathroom for shavers & toothbrush chargers. You'll have to be careful there since many of those items are not dual voltage and you'll have permanent damage using just a plug converter... best to get a 220v charger for those items if you come to Europe a lot. Given these gripes though, the Hilton Arc de Triomphe is still a very good hotel and my default when visiting Paris.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hudson, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWould not consider staying anywhere else in Paris\u201d", "Author": "nongagkram", "ReviewID": "UR123464069", "Content": "Staff is always very accomodation for early flight arrivals.

There was some issue with the safe in the room to which we were assigned but they worked to resolve it while we had refreshments and unwound after traveling. It wasn't a big deal at all and they were very apologetic. The room itself was spacious enough by Paris standards. It was certainly not palatial but the hotel rooms in Paris are typically small, so I wasn't surprised. Everything was clean, up-to-date, and well-appointed. The bathroom was comfortable, though not large at all. This hotel's location is a good fifteen-minute walk to the nearest subway station and, even then, multiple connections always seemed necessary to get where we wanted to go. That said, the walk is pleasant enough and it's not an issue, but this is something to consider if you like the subway directly outside your door. The location to sights of interest along the western part of Paris's center is excellent, though Isle da la Cite (with Nortre Dame, etc), and The Louvre are a good 40-to-60-minute walk. There are restaurants in the immediate area but I wouldn't call the number plentiful. Still, we didn't starve. The only real negatives I can offer is the water pressure in the bathroom (or, as my traveling companion asked \"What water pressure? There isn't any!\"). It took twice as long to shower because the trickle of water didn't really offer a robust rinsing capability. There was no hotel-wide wireless, so it was possible to use the internet in the Executive Lounge but nowhere else. But, these are small considerations for me. All in all, a good spot to stay.

We arrived late in the evening after taking the Eurostar from London and the hotel was quite full but check in was still quick and service with a smile. The gentleman who checked us had some excellent recommendations about what to see during our short trip. Unfortunately our great first impression of the hotel quickly changed when we went upstairs to our room on the second floor. As soon as we got off the elevator there was a desk with a security guard who asked to see inside my moms bag. We let him have a look and went on to our room. Over the next few days we were tortured by the security guard daily. One day we got in the elevator (lift) and we were chased down by the guard and asked to get out of it that it was reserved. He said we could take the stairs! Out came and entire group from there rooms and got in the elevators! I was furious. This happened daily over and over and got worse. One night mom went out looking for the ice machine and he escorted her back to her room and said to not walk down the hallway. I went down to the front desk to talk to someone and told Latifa what was going on. She informed me that the security did not work for the Hilton but rather was private and was for the group on our floor. I was happy that they didn't work for hilton but was a little sad that Hilton allowed this group to have full control of the floor I was on. If they were so important they should have reserved the entire hotel for themselves or at least the entire floor. The evening before we checked I was walking into the hotel and Latifa seen me and called me over to the front desk. She said the assistant manager manager would like to talk to me. He was very polite and apologetic. He explained that I wasn't the only person in the hotel that was having problems and he wanted to let me know that the next time I was in Paris that I would be staying at the Hilton and he would be taking care of the room. He took my contact information and promised to email me after I arrived home. He did not ever email me and sadly after me emailing the hotel and management on several occasions to schedule my trip back, I have never heard back from the Hilton Arc De Triomphe. I wanted to give the hotel a 5 star rating but since I loved the hotel and thought the staff was great but since they didn't ever follow up with having me back as they promised I am a bit disappointed.

The dis-appintements were as follows: - the hotel is not very close to the acivities as it makes it sound. Champs is about 12-15 mins walk and the Arc is also the same distance. The metro is about 7 mins walk away. - the hotel has absolutely no neighbourhood. we had a room overlooking a construction site and very depressing and cold. - there are hardly any cafes or restaurants around, so the place is very lonely at night. - the lobby was always full of people, with lot of activity and the hotel somehow lost its charm because of that. - the floors have numerous rooms and we got one that was at one end of the floor. The walk from the lift to the hotel by itself was 3 mins! and the walls of the corridor looked outdated and tired. - the hotel exterior too needs a make-over as it is very tired-looking. - the hotel has NO wi-fi in the rooms. The only wifi available is in the lobby. - we needed to contact the front desk for some info and it took us 25 mins to finally reach someone on the phone. No one seemed to pick up the phone.

The lounge is spacious and comfortable and we sent many hours just relaxing there. the only complaint we have is that on previous visits there were no children allowed in the 7th floor lounge; instead they used a family lounge. This time there were several children there and unfortunately they were often running around and noisy with no supervision from their obviously oblivious parents. But that is our only complaint. Although the offerings in the lounge are not meant to feed you like a restaurant at every setting, there is always something for everyone and drinks of all kinds are always available.

We used to stay at the Hilton Eiffel Park Hotel, however, that is no longer a Hilton property. We were very disappointed to be at a different hotel, but felt comfortable at this property based on the reviews. We arrived at the hotel prior to check in, yet they had our rooms ready and available for us. Since we had two teenagers with us needed two rooms. We were given adjoining rooms, one with a king bed and one with two double beds. The rooms were decorated in the very chic look of the art deco period. The rooms were pretty small and since we were not upgraded due to our Diamond status because of the adjoining rooms, I don't know if rooms on higher floors are more spacious. There was ample closet space and storage space despite the small room size. One thing we noticed was that there were inconsistencies in the rooms. For example, one room had a tea pot and service the other did not. One room had a safe, the other did not. I am sure that both rooms can be independently rented without having to have adjoining guests, so it seemed odd that the items were hit or miss. We had executive lounge access, however, during our stay, the lounge was closed for remodeling so there was a family lounge that we could use. This was actually a good idea and something I have never seen before. In this lounge, there were video games and a large play area for families traveling with kids. I would guess this is handy when adults traveling alone are in the lounge and don't want to be distracted by rambunctious children. The downside is that the lounge was filled to capacity each morning so we opted to eat in the restaurant. Good choice. The restaurant has an excellent morning buffet. My daughter loved the crepes with chocolate sauce pain au chocolate. This made it easier to get her up in the morning knowing that there was a sumptuous breakfast waiting for her. The hotel front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel is located within two blocks of a Metro Station and is about a ten to fifteen minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe where you can pick up the Metro or RER.

Based on the experiences of our last trip, I decided it was time to give back. We planned an elopment in Paris and based on the reviews of this site decided to stay at this hotel. It's a difficult thing to gauge - trying to decipher completely opposing reviews and decided which is correct. We took a leap of faith and decided to book for 5 nights (using points). And it's a great thing we did! I contacted the hotel in advance to get clarification on some of the issues in previous reviews I had seen, which were all addressed. I am Gold with Hilton, and while that doesn't gaurantee room upgrades or access to the exeutive lounge based on the large number of Diamonds in the world, we did in fact get a room upgrade and access to the lounge. The room was absolutely fantastic! It was the last room at the end of the hall on the front side of the hotel, top floor, and according to the diagram on the backside of the door, it was 1.5 times the size of other rooms. In addition, it had a HUGE balcony that was larger than the width of our room, complete with a 4 seat table and chairs! The room was spotless and quite large. Firm king bed, a couch, coffee table and two chairs, and a desk. Shortly after we arrived, a large flower arrangement was delivered to our room from the hotel to congratulate us for our wedding/honeymoon! It was such a thoughtful gesture. Then after we went out to explore the first day, we came back to a bottle of champagne and a beautiful dessert in the room! This place really knows how to make you feel special! The location of this place is PERFECT! We were within easy walking distance to at least 6 metro stations, and it was an easy walk to Champs Elysees the Arc de Triomphe. In regards to other reviews talking about walking distance... I am a 30-something, lazy, somewhat overweight American and I walked back to the hotel from Notre Dame (check a map). So anyone between 12 - 60+ years old that have no physical impediments should have no problem walking at the very least to the nearby metro stations. The executive lounge was being renovated so it was temporarily relocated to the first floor. This was probably better as the room was huge! We definitely used the lounge daily.

Prior to writing this review I read some other reviews and one in particular struck me as down to expectations. The reviewer referenced \"executive\" and \"deluxe\" and I have to agree with him that those words are banded around all to easily. I think the best description of this hotel would be efficient and well run with business visitors front and foremost. The hotel has 463 rooms so any ideas of exclusivity or luxury should be done away with. Demand for services is high and in my opinion the hotel does well in handling the volume of guests that it handles. The foyer and and public rooms are very nicely decorated - oppulent comes to mind. The rooms are what you would expect from a Hilton - reasonably appointed with all the necessary fixtures, fittings and well managed by a competent housekeeping staff including a full turndown service. If you are looking for a romantic 5 star place - this is not it. If it a decent well run hotel in a good location you need this is a candidate. During our stay the concierge lounge was being refurbished and was located in a conference room on the ground floor. A previous reviewer referred to it as a cafeteria, I think that is a little harsh. It is open from 7-11 and seated about 50 people, we had breakfast there every morning and considering the volume of people using it I think they did an exceptional job in keeping it stocked. Hot items available, freshly squeezed orange juice, smoked salmon, range of pastries, etc etc. I think it was very well done - the room was not the greatest but it was fine. Lunch, afternoon cakes and evening snacks are also available. If you are paying for all this I can understand that this would not be to expectations - but as a Hilton property anyone that is a Gold or Diamond member has access to this room - Paris is #1 city destination in the world and, like me, a lot of Hilton regulars use their points to go to Paris so demand for this kind of service is going to be high. We ate one evening in the restaurant and it was excellent - despite a mix up on the order the food was excellent as was the friendly service - do not over look this if you want a relaxing dinner. The concierge recommended 2 restaurants for us - both were excellent.

Long story short ... we should have celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary in the Maldives...first grandchild due week of anniversary, arrives early, book trip to Paris. Read all reviews and get a great deal though Expedia for a DeLuxe Executive plus room, decided to splash the cash as it was our Silver Wedding. Included was Breakfast, access to the Executive Lounge on the 6th floor with views of Paris and the room had a balcony, maybe with a view of the tower. I'd e-mailed to hotel hoping for a room with a view of the tower given our 25th, told may not be possible as rooms are at a premium, no problem, worth trying. On arrival we learnt that the 6th floor executive lounge was being refurbished and now on the ground floor, the executive lounge turned out to be a large conference room with a large tv, two armchairs and a sofa in one corner and a lot of tables set out in rows. I equated it with an upmarket staff canteen. There were a lot of families staying there using these facilities which made it appear more like a all inclusive holiday hotel. Instead of the views of Paris we got a view of the net curtains onto the corrider. On the second day of our stay the lounge was closed for the afternoon while they relocated the lounge to a conference room a third of the size of the previous one. We used the lounge a total of three times during our 5 day stay, choosing to take our breakfast in the lovely restaurant. I was at least expecting our DeLuxe Executive bedroom to blow us away, to say we were underwhelmed would be a understatement. The room had nothing that we had had before in rooms costing a third of what we had paid for this, the bed was very large and comfortable but in order to access the \"balcony\" required moving the table and chair !, making sure not to clatter into the standard lamp at the side. On accessing the Balcony we were struck by the views which this afforded us, around 50 metres across the garden courtyard stood an office block, we could see them working and if not having the curtain drawn they could see into our room. I have a problem with what the hotels definition of the word balcony is. The \"balcony \" was no more than 5 x 4 feet square, there was no furniture on the balcony, probably due to the fact that there was no room to put it, with my wife and myself stood there there was no more room. I would describe the area more of a large ledge, from which given the problems we had getting here and the subsequent disappointment was tempted to jump !!!. So all in all we were really disappointed with what in our world was an extraordinary amount of money for, I clearly have a different definition of the words \"Executive \", \"DeLuxe\" and \"Balcony\", when booking a DeLuxe Exective room I expect something extraordinary, not something ordinary which is what we recieved. To top it all, given that I had told the hotel the we were celebrating our Silver Wedding on the 16th, I obviously naively expected, maybe a bunch of flowers, chocolates or at least a half bottle of their cheapest plonk, what we got was nothing, given our experience so far I should not have been surprised. The best things about the hotel are the public areas, which are very sumptuous and elegant. The breakfast was brilliant, the choice was extraordinary. I had a word with one of the concierges for recommendations for a nice Bistro in which to spend our Anniversary evening. He recommended Andre Allard in the St Germain district and made the booking for us, we had a fabulous evening there for which I have left a review. The hotel is in a quiet area, around ten minutes walk from the Arc, the Parc Monceau nearby is a very nice place to take a stroll in the evening.

Location - a central location in Paris might be next to Notre Dame. This hotel is not in the geopgraphical centre, but it is in a very nice neighborhood, clean, quiet. Rooms - we had a King Deluxe Plus overlooking the patio. A beuatifully furnished and well equipped room (and bathroom). Overlooking the patio allowed us to have windows open all night (for me a prerequisite for a good night's sleep) Breakfast - well organised, good choices. Public transport - one metro stop (\"Courcelles\") within 5' walking distance or even less, bus stop in same direction and distance, metro hub \"Etoile\" (Arc de Triomphe) 10' of pleasant(!) walking, alternative metro stop between 5-10' walking (did not use it), air port shuttles (operated by Air France) behind Arc de Triomphe) Having said that, my issue is the way my loyalty with Hilton (Gold status) has or has not been recognised. These expectations are based on Hiltons' own regulation and they always depend on the hotel managers' discretion. This is all well known to me. I received what I had booked and have been happy with it: a King Deluxe Plus, breakfast included. At check-in I was told I was upgraded to a King Deluxe Plus and breakfast is complimentary. In the room, a greeting and a small chocolate gift was deposited. The daily news-paper, promised at check-in, was not delivered at all. Since Executive Rooms were unavailable, and no alternative room upgrade was at hand, since breakfast was already included in the rate, I really wondered what would be the perk for Gold members. I tried to find out the other day at reception and received a rather blunt answer. The receptionist told that she had to reassure with guest relations first. I suggested a bottle of wine or champagne. Indeed, at night we found 1/2 bottle of champagne and a (decent) chocolate gift. I simply do not understand how this property acts below standards they are obliged to follow. I wrote this down at the guest comment card. At check-out I spoke to a different receptionist who agreed that this should not happen. He said he would follow up with this. Yet, I did not receive any reply from management.

Since we were three adults, got a Double Double room which as far as I could tell was the same size as a normal room only with two doubles. Room was pretty good, bathroom nice with marble or granite features but nothing too grand for what I expected, just your average hilton but at 50k points a night :-( Some things to note which did not sit well for us... 1. Our room was awesome to have a direct view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance, however below it was a construction site where workers commenced operations very early in the morning. Jack-hammering was not in tune with my sleeping. I don't remember seeing on the hotels website that these works were going on [although I could have missed it]. 2. We reported that our TV would loose its reception on average ever 10 mins [some times every 2 mins] for 3-4 secs at a time, making it a real pain in the *** to watch TV broadcasts. They sent an Engineer to look at it and he said would contact an external provider or something but never heard back and it was never fixed. I again advised the checkout person at reception and he just laughed when i told him our TV never got fixed [I am not joking he laughed]! 3. Being a room of three adults, I would have expected three of everything [ie towels, drinking mugs, slippers etc]. On each day we had to prompt them to bring the extra items, I was getting sick of having to call them, and having to call different departments sometimes, as one person should have taken care of it all. That is what I would expect for a five star hotel. 4. Wi-fi was not available in the hotel despite the brochure saying it was. Other internet was at a fee in the room [direct cable connection]. I wish the large hotel chains would stop trying to squeeze every $ out of its guests and charge for nearly every service. Internet should be free and unlimited for all hotel guests. Our previous hotel in Roma had it for free even in the rooms so that was great!! 5. Dark stains on the carpet made the room feel a bit dirty, however the beds were crisp and clean. and 6. Upon checkout, we were hit with a parking bill of something like 30 Euros [can't remember exact amount]. We never hired a car in Paris so laughed at this. I wonder if they throw on random charges with the hope some may stick with the customer accepting the charge. They also forced us to sign that this charge was not related to us. I fail to see why we should sign anything when it was the Hotels fault and seemingly a random charge. Room service was expensive and so was breakfast so we never tried any of the hotels food, which is a shame as the hilton food is usually pretty good. It really does upset me when alot of $$$ [or points] are spent on 5 star hotels just to get you in the door, and then you are greeted with very expensive room service charges. But that is how it seems to be in most places, I wish they would subsidise the food to an extent [ok I will stop dreaming ^_^]. Overall, a very average stay at such an expensive hotel, other hilton stays have been much better.

We'd just come from the London Chancery Court, and I did a gushing review of that place--elegant, spacious, gracious. The Hilton Arc de Triomphe was none of those things. The rooms were cramped--even the bathrooms were crowded with just one person in them. Showering required acrobatic feats, and the only way to stand under the small trickle of warm water was to have the faucet jammed into your calf. The lamp cord was wrapped onto the corner of the bed, and the lamp actually fell onto me in the middle of the night. The phone rang at 3 in the morning by accident. The printer in the business office wasn't working, making the printing out of boarding passes a real problem. The front desk staff were snotty and arrogant about any guest complaints. They really projected the attitude, \"we have your money already, we don't care.\" The food (breakfasts ) were good (they would have been terribly overpriced, but were included in our package). The towels and robes were nice. The lobby and restaurant are decorated in lovely fashion. As others have mentioned, the hotel is INCREDIBLY STINGY about internet service. Even if you are silver elite Hilton, you get not even ONE free hour of internet connection. That will cost you 9 euro---about what you would pay in the US for 24 hours. This, after you've paid about $500 a night for a room 1/2 the size of what you might get at a Holiday inn in the states. I'll be writing a letter of complaint about this facility to Hilton and to Disney---it was a real let down and source of frustration to what was otherwise a magical trip. This facility just isn't up to the usual Hilton standards (e.g., Boston Logan Airport, Philadelphia at U Penn, Washington DC).

We went to our regular room and I must say were completely underwhelmed. I have stayed at Category 4 Hilton properties that had nicer rooms and views. The point is if they are going to take Category 7 level points out of the account (which is supposed to include Waldorf Astoria type properties) then the room given in the transaction should be at least better then what you would get at a Holiday Inn.

The next morning we were moving into \"executive \" level rooms, one deluxe king room and one deluxe king suite. We were told to leave our bags packed in the rooms and they would be transferred to our new digs. Upon returning from that days sightseeing we were excited to see our executive level rooms. They were disappointing. The rooms were on separate floors and both were of lesser quality than the ones we had stayed in the night before. Hotel rooms can be funny, really its about expectations. We expected more from our upgraded (VERY expensive) executive level rooms. Had we never seen the previous nights offerings I'm sure we would have been happy enough. But we had, and the hotel should know better. We traded our garden view for a street view of nondescript buildings (under construction). The suite was under-whelming (I don't think I even got a \"wow\" from my 12 year old daughter). I would advise this hotel's designers to swing by the Hilton Orlando next time they're in the US for some ideas. To make things even a little more sour, our bags were not in our rooms as promised. No one seemed to know where they had spent the day, but we got them about an hour later. I read many positive TA reviews regarding the executive level lounge.

Spacious (for France) but really dumb, annoying issues. 1) TV remote: trying to get a channel took about 10 pushes, then the TV would occasionally decide to turn itself on. Kettle: stuck to a tray positioned tantalizingly out of reach of the electrical sockets, so to boil water I had to transport the tray and all it's stuff across the room. Not a big deal but stupid. Magnifying mirror in the bathroom: sadly I am at the age where I need this. But, it's no good when it's not movable, has no light and is stuck inaccessibly to the wall in a dark bathroom. Shower: annoyingly, this couldn't be fixed to spray outwards, so I had to stand on the plug hole close to the wall. Internet: you have to pay. By the hour or by the day. Other, lower rated hotels give this service for free! Dinner recommendations: we asked. we won't again. We were sent to a pretty mediocre cafe/bar when we asked for a nice restaurant. Very disappointing. We didn't want the fare you find at every cafe/restaurant in Paris on every street corner.

We are Hilton Diamond menbers, so we do often get upgrades to executive floor rooms, but this was beyond the usual upgrade. There are probably fewer than 10 rooms in the hotel that have the balcony and Eiffel Tower view, so this kindness was much appreciated. After we got to our room, we went out for a walk and loved the neighborhood. It was pretty quiet with lots of locals around. We had lunch at a nearby cafe (can't remember the name), and when we came back to the room, there was a lovely bouquet of flowers, a bottle of champagne, and deserts waiting for us. So nice! We went out on our balcony and ate the deserts and drank the champagne while looking at the Eiffel Tower. Every morning, we went to the executive lounge to have breakfast, which was plenty to fill us up. Each day they had eggs (great eggs, must have had tons of cream in them), bacon, potatoes, fruit, croissant (including chocolate ones), juices, great coffee and more. When we headed out for our days' adventures, it was a quick walk to two metro stations (Courselles, Monceau) and a bus stop even closer. To get to the Monceau metro, you walk through Monceau Park, which is very nice and has many people out walking, jogging, riding the carousel or just sitting on benches. It was nice that the hotel provided 2 complimentary bottles of water in the room every day, so we could pack them in to drink while out walking. One day we went out when it was raining, and the doormen had umbrellas for people to borrow for the day. When we came back at the end of the day, the room was always nicely cleaned and resupplied with towels and toiletries. Then we'd head back to the executive lounge for food and wine. Each night they had a great soup, two hot appetizers, breads, etc. They also had wine, champagne, and even liquor if you went to the back side of the wall to find it. We met several people again and again in the lounge and really enjoyed talking with them about our days' adventures. We usually didn't even go out for dinner after that, as we were exhausted from our day, and we had had plenty to eat and drink. We did go our for our anniversary dinner, though, to the Ciel de Paris.

A short ride or walk to the Eiffel Tower. So we stayed in a 2 bedroom family room. You open a door with your hotel key card to a hall and then there are doors to the right and left. One was set up with a king bed the other with two double beds and a crib. They also had treats for the kids and adults waiting for us when we arrived. Each room had a modern bathroom and the soap and shampoo were Crabtree and Evelyn. The bath sheets were very soft too. Everything was very well done in the modern art deco theme and squeeky clean. The beds were comfortable as well as the lines and pillows. I am picky so trust me on this. The maids were wonderful with general housekeeping and turndown and they always gave us plenty of towels. Love that. The whole hotel is done in a Art Deco motif. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of art deco; but it seems as if \"the city of lights\" is. It was everywhere you turned in Paris. The rooms and hall ways had lots of replicas of Erte artwork. I didn't like the lobby, but that is probably because it was small and art deco. The fresh flowers however were lovely and so beautiful I had to touch them to confirm they were real. They were. The staff was all top notch. Accolades to the concierge. He went out of his way literally to help you. He would walk out of the hotel with you to point to where to go, and make sure you knew where to turn. Everyone spoke excellent english; which sadly was not the case when we stayed in London later on this visit. The main restaurant we ate at only once and it seemed way over priced; luckily the concierge recommended tons of great places to eat and we had a wonderful time. One bummer of course is that you get smoke blown in your face from every direction from all the Europeans who smoke like chimney stacks. They even will blow second hand cigarette smoke right into a baby's face. Crazy people. Nice enough, but don't they get it? I didn't run into any snobby people in Paris despite the stereotype; everyone was super friendly and helpful and lovely; minus of course the smoke. What else? Hmmmm.

I was so pleased when we pulled up and it didn't look like it did in the photos. Note to Paris Hilton... get new photos taken ASAP!

You may be the only American in the restaurant, which is kind of a fun thing! We actually walked from the Louvre back to our hotel. The walk isn't for the faint of heart and is definitely a hike, but is one I will always remember. There were so many neat things to see along the way. Breakfast here is breathtakingly pricey. There is a cheaper option directly across the street, and another one to the right and down the hill. However, I would suggest trying it once. It is a fabulous. It's a buffet. I'm not normally big on buffets, but for this I made an exception. If you are unsure, ask if you can go look.

The room was also very quiet. The bathroom was reasonably modern, and a decent size. However, as another reviewer mentioned, shower pressure was very poor - we weren't sufficiently bothered to report it. Room service was good, but not great given the rack rate for such a room.

It is open from 7 AM to 11 PM each day and is constantly stocked with fantastic foods and beverages. As Gold HHonors members we were given access to the Executive Lounge and used it every morning for breakfast and often in the evening for snacks or a small meal. The breakfast had eggs, bacon, fried potatoes, cold cereals, yogurt, cheeses, an assortment of breads and pastries, and about 5-6 different types of high quality juice (orange, apricot, apple, grapefruit, etc). This was an excellent way to start our day. In the afternoons, a selection of cheese, cookies, sodas, breads, etc was always on hand. In the evenings there was usually a soup such as tomato, carrot, or potato and various hot appetizer-style foods in addition to the breads and cheese. There were also chips, salsa, crackers, nuts, and a full selection of sodas and alcohols in the evening. From 9 PM to 11 PM fresh chocolates are put out and this is an excellent way to end the day. The lounge seating area is fantastic with an outdoor balcony that has about 6-8 tables and and spacious indoor seating area with many tables and bar areas as well. The room itself was comfortable with robes and slippers, a spacious bathroom with tub and shower and toiletry items from Crabtree & Evelyn. The bed was comfortable however not quite as comfortable as many Hilton beds I have experienced in the USA. Noise was not generally a problem however some noise from the hallway would occassionally come into our room. There is no wi-fi internet in the rooms but there is a wired internet terminal which is extremely fast. Internet access costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22 per day unless you are HHonors Gold or Diamond member which makes the internet free. Prices for everything in this hotel were quite ridiculous (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac7 for a soda or candy bar from the mini-bar, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6 for an orange juice on the room service menu, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac36 for full room service breakfast, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 connection fee to make a phone call, etc) however most travelers should know these types of prices are to be expected at luxury hotels in major cities. The location is within a 5-7 minute walk from a metro stop so that made getting around Paris relatively easy. There are also always taxis available outside the hotel. If needing to travel to a location during non-peak traffic times (early morning or later in evening), the taxis are actually fairly economical for a large city. We took one a couple times around 7 AM and went at least 4-5 km for only about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11. However it cost us about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9 and took about 15-20 minutes to go only about 1-2 km at 9:15 AM when traffic was heavy. We stayed at this hotel using HHonors rewards points and were treated very well by the staff, no differently than if we had paid cash for our stay. The concierge and guest relations team at this hotel are among the finest, always willing and able to answer our questions or make recommendations for the area. Check-out was a bit slow at 8:30 AM on a Saturday morning because at that time there were also a large number of Americans checking in (I am assuming they had just arrived from the airport on trans-Atlantic flights). The hotel could benefit from making separate lines for check-in and check out for peak times such as the mornings between 7:30 and 9:30 AM. Our taxi transfer to the airport on Saturday morning was only about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40 and took under 25 minutes because of light traffic. I would highly recommend using the taxi to transfer to and from the airport if you are arriving during a non-peak traffic time. Overall we would gladly stay at this hotel again using HHonors reward points however if paying the full price with cash there may be a better value out there for an equally nice hotel with a more central location in Paris.

The staff we're friendly and helpful, especially in the restaurant which does the standard Hilton deal of kids eat free with a paying adult, considering the kids menu was around 22 euros, that's a good saving. One big tip, as many previous reviewers we paid extra for an executive room which permitted access to the Executive Lounge. This is a nice room on the 6th floor (no views I'm afraid) and served breakfast in the morning then drinks and snacks all day long. If you conisder at a roadside cafe (and this was lierally roadside, nothing scenic!) we paid 30 euros for 1 tea, 1 coffee, 2 apple juice and 1 crepe, then a quick nip back to the hotel for the same for free covered the extra paid for the room and some more. From around 6pm they have champange, wine, spirits, beers and plenty of food all for free. You can also check-in and out at the lounge which means no hanging around in the lobby. On our last day (which ran into the first day of the Easter holiday) they set-up a room on the ground floor as the Family Executive Lounge and sent people with young kids to that room when they tried to enter the normal lounge. This room wasn't as nice as the usual lounge, it was much bigger (they set-up toddler toys in a corner) and had no atmosphere, if we'd have been forced down here the whole time I probably wouldn't have been as satisfied. I'd check what the poilcy is during the holidays. All-in-all it's a great hotel and worth paying that bit extra for the Hilton standard.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel and location, highly recommended\u201d", "Author": "TempAd", "ReviewID": "UR107990786", "Content": "We stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for 5 nights and it was nothing short of fabulous.

Location: A short 5-10 minute walk to the Metro at the Arc de Triomphe and numerous other metro stops on different lines. Grocery store close by, tons of restaurants in the area. Rooms: The room was beautifully decorated and had a window that opened up to a quiet view of the courtyard. It was large by European standards and had a big screen TV, desk, seating area and king size bed. The bathroom had a separate tub and shower, which was nice. The sink and vanity area was outside of the toilet/tub/shower area which is extremely convenient when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sharing the room.

I could not find one and jokingly told the hostess that I couldn't leave Paris without eating one. She immediately went to the chef and requested one for me. A little while later, I was happily eating my croque monsieur in the bar lounge. The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood, but only about a 2-3 minute walk to a metro stop and a 10-15 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. I very much appreciated the quiet location during a very, very busy Easter week in Paris. There are several bistros and cafes within easy walking distance. There is a small Monoprix (Monop) just down the street and a Banque National de Paris at the metro stop. The rooms were surprisingly spacious for Europe. I am always pleasantly surprised by the little extras that Hilton offers - slippers, water bottles, chocolates, and, in Paris, a little bottle of perfume with the toiletries!

The staff was absolutely excellent from the bellhops to the executive lounge staff. First, the concierge staff is among the best I've ever experienced. We flew into CDG, purchased Carte Navago passes which provide unlimited public transport around Paris. The concierge at the Hilton told us exactly how to get from CDG to the Hotel. Then each day of our stay the concierge was able to tell us quickly and easily how to navigate the subway to get where we wanted to go. There are two stops within a block or two of the hotel. They cheerfully helped us with dinner reservations and a wealth of local knowledge for sightseeing. The front desk personnel were sharp and friendly. The manager contacted us during our stay and made sure our girls had received their welcoming gift (they had not) and which I suppose is tied to the rewards program. She invited them to visit her the next day and she presented them with gifts that will be long enjoyed and remembered. The executive lounge was excellent with service all day and well into the evening. They go above and beyond expectations. Eggs and bacon, croissants, rolls, cereals, jams and much more for breakfast, light lunch items, mid afternoon snacks, cocktail hour drinks and heavy hors devours, and late night nibbles. Great lounge. The rooms are large, new and very comfortable. From top to bottom this hotel and its staff made our trip to Paris one to remember. No negatives whatsover....except that you eventually have to leave. As a side note, we also purchased the unlimited museum passes in the airport and found it to be a good value. you can dip in and out of museums and not feel like you have to spend the entire day as all access is covered by the passes. Coupled with the unlimited transportation pass, an adult can really see alot for about $100 bucks.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malmo, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood but not perfect\u201d", "Author": "sq7700", "ReviewID": "UR106530146", "Content": "Arrival We arrived at the hotel just after 11 pm after a short (~10 minutes) walk from Arc de Triomphe (where the Air France Orly buses terminate). It was a safe walk, even during this hour, and not hard to find. We asked the staff at what time the executive lounge closes and we were a bit unlucky since they just closed. However, they didn't offer us any refreshments or anything during check in. Instead, we went up the our room on the 7th floor. Here, on the other hand, you could get something to drink - if you want to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 (approx 12 USD) for small can of coke. All right, it's a minibar but there has to some sort of line. At least if the executive room, which we had reserved, is around 450 EUR (approx 670 USD) per night. Room I'd say that the room is of a quite normal size (at least in Europe). It has a nice flat screen TV, a minibar (ridiculously expensive, though), a few drawers, a desk - a little bit of everything that you may or may not need. Pretty much everything you could expect from a 4 star hotel. Umbrellas are even provided, however, not in your room, but in the lobby. The bathroom includes separate bath and shower which is, of corse, very smart. At least our room had a furnished balcony facing Rue de Courcells, however it seemed as if not all rooms did have a balcony. The room was cleaned once or even twice a day and was generally very clean. The carpet looked a bit tired, though. Location Paris is a huge city and therefore there is no real city center, it consists of many areas - the one different from the other. As a tourist you'll most likely want to stay somewhere around the river of Seine as that's where most of the main tourist attractions are located (such as the Eiffel Tower, the Arc of Triomphe itself, Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es, the Louve and the Notre Dame). This Hilton complex is located, as said before, in a rather quiet business/residential area. It takes approximately ten minutes to either Arc de Triomphe (where you'll get access to the Paris metro, which is, per definition, access to every pocket of Paris) or Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es/George V. So yes, the hotel is centrally located and you can easily walk to all of Paris' main attractions - if you enjoy walking that is. It may not be located in the most chic area of Paris, but I wasn't disappointed. Executive Lounge If you pay for an executive room you'll get access to the exectuive lounge located on 6th floor. Opening hours are from early morning (7 am) til late evening (11 pm) - however - don't plan on staying here all of that time. What's offered in the lounge depends on the time of the day. In the morning you'll find a rather small breakfast buffet, however, I'd say it contains just as what you need. The coffee and the freshly squeezed orange juice are extra nice. During lunch there are some (boring) sandwiches, vegetables etc. Sodas, beers and water plus snacks are provided all day. Wine is only available during lunch and early evening. For some reason, they'll take it away in the late afternoon and in the late evening (we couldn't get a glass of wine when returning after dinner, just after 10 pm). And for some reason, they'll only provide sparkling wine for a couple of hours in the early evening. A bit cheap, I'd say. Other There's a small spa, including a jacuzzi. As we had seen the pictures on the website we did bring swimwear. The ladies greeted us nicely and showed us to the jacuzzi which was very nice, but as we left for the room to go and change we were a bit shocked. There was an entrance fee. 30 EUR for the two of us - just to use a jacuzzi. To the management of this hotel: Did you forget that we - as your guests - are actually paying around 450 euro not per stay but per NIGHT? And we can't use the jacuzzi, unless we pay you even more money? Samething goes for the business center and inroom Wifi. The verdict Being at a good location (which is kind of vague when it comes to Paris) and being as clean as it obviously is, the hotel should definately earn its four stars. However, the room rates are way too high (even for Paris standards that is) compared to what you get. You'll need to remember that this is not pure luxury. Pure luxury, for me, is when a hotel can afford not to take away middle class wines for a couple of hours in the afternoon, just because they want save a little money - or when they won't ask their guests to pay a rather small - but symbolic sum of money to use a basic facility as a jacuzzi.

First of all, the hotel was beautiful, the staff was especially friendly and the rooms were very nice. The bad...THE AIR CONDITIONING SUCKS IN THIS HOTEL!!! It was unusually hot for this time of year, and in our rooms that we had, the air conditioning never got cooler no matter where we set the thermostat. We switched rooms, and we still had the same problem. We were told that everything was working properly and were given 2 fans for our room to keep it cool. Not exactly what you would expect from a hotel like this. If you are booking a room with 2 beds, take caution. 2 queens is not 2 queens. it's 2 full size beds. Also, this hotel is totally into making you spend as much money as possible if you want anything to eat or drink. 24 euro's for a hamburger and 8 euros for a coke. that's about the equivalent of $30 and $12 respectively. Now I know you are going to say that you shouldn't be eating these things when you are in Europe. I didn't eat any american food while I was here, and cokes were available EVERYWHERE in the city for around the same price you would pay in America. Also, the hotel isn't necessarily super close to anything, but is very close to the metro. USE THE METRO OVER CABS!!! It's a great system, and if you have enough confidence in yourself to use it, you will save yourself a ton of money!!

Check in was frustrating because someone was checking out at the HHonors check in desk and since the guests didn't speak any english, we were kept waiting for about 15 minutes while the other front desk folks were helping other guests. Once we did get to the check in desk, we were told that we would have to produce a reward certificate which we never received from Hilton, because we redeemed our points online. After some more minutes of the clueless front desk agent winking at us for everything and rambling on about various other things, she found our reservation and checked us in. Stay itself was fine, rooms are excellent. Please be aware that contrary to its name, this Hilton is actually a little away from Arc de Triomphe (0.6 miles or so). The nearest Metro is Courcelles, which is about 5-8 minutes walk. If you want to get to a hub, Charles de Gaualle-Etoile is the nearest station and thats about 10-15 minutes walk. This seems to be the business district and since we were there on a Sunday and Monday (Easter Monday), everything was closed and I mean everything. Not a single place to eat nearby and we ended up having to purchase the overpriced brunch at the hotel (they suspended the regular menu and replaced it with the brunch only at 70 Euros per person). Not happy about that. Probably not the hotel's fault, but it's worth knowing if you plan on visiting. Also be aware that there are inconsistencies in their final checkout bill - they tack on charges for snacks from minibar and hope you don't notice. Our bill had a charge from the DAY OF CHECKOUT for a Special K bar - how is that even possible? How can they charge us for a mini bar item that we didn't even use and that too on the day of checkout? Additional points to note - Wifi is not provided, you pay E8.50 for one hour or E21.00 for the day, Business Center is not free either.

I had reserved a double queen room so we could all stay in the same room. The going rate for this room was 300 euros/night so I was able to redeem my hhonors points for 3 free nights. My one complaint with this hotel has to do with the check-in. We arrived at the hotel around 11am and was informed that our room was ready. So I showed my hhonors award letter and then they tried to charge me an extra 80 euros per night since there were 2 extra adults staying in the room (40/person). I complained and asked to speak with a manager and even showed my reservation confirmation and no where on the confirmation did it say there would be an extra charge for 2 extra adults in the room. The reception made a call to the manager and was quickly told they would waive the charge since I was a Diamond member. I just found this to be deceptive and I figure they try to take advantage of their guests in this manner. I have never had this happen at another Hilton property. I have also noticed this policy with some other hotel chains, but the extra charges were not noted on my reservation confirmation when I booked the room. Just keep an eye out for this at the Hilton in Paris and demand to speak with a manager if they try to charge you the extra fees. Everything else at this hotel was great. Please note it is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro stop. Not very convenient to all the sites, but this is your best Hilton option in Paris to be close enough to the sites. Also note that many of the cafes close tot he hotel close early so your options for a close dinner are limited. It is also about a 15 minute walk to the nearest train station (St Lazare). One great thing I liked about this Hilton is the access to the hhonors lounge. Free drinks (beer, wine, cocktails, coffee) in the evenings along with light snacks (soup, appetizers, chips, cookies, etc). We did some damage in the lounge as it saved us some money on the drinks instead of buying them at the bar downstairs. Easily $100/day. Rooms were clean and spacious for 4 adults. I would stay here again, just keep an eye out for the extra room charges at check-in.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ulladulla", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service & Position Made our trip to Paris Perfect thank you\u201d", "Author": "ulladulla", "ReviewID": "UR102711377", "Content": "We used points and paid extra on arrival for Exec lounge the two 9 year olds treated like royalty free pink Hilton Arc de Triomphe caps for the girls great safe location room service my daughter said 10/10 Concierge the best out there you must use these people to your full advantage in your stay night cruise on the seine everything recommended and booked first class Taxi form CDG easy great safe location we cannot recommend this hotel more highly the best Hotel 5 Weeks in europe", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery nice and comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "IronBird0", "ReviewID": "UR101896653", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 days in September 2010 and had a wonderful stay.

Glad I chose the Hilton. Did not get an upgrade to executive floor despite Gold membership, but I did get an upgraded room and was very happy with my stay. Very quiet room facing inner courtyard there are many rooms facing in like this and probably all quiet like mine. Having such a quiet room in Paris is really a lovely thing. Hilton breakfast is one of the better ones includes the usuals but also lovely croissants, crepes, many good fish, cheeses and meets and other fresh things. The main restaurant has a fantastic chef. I ate there my first night mainly because i was too jetlagged to go elsewhere - but the food was so good I kept on coming back on successive nights. One night a friend took me to what was supposed to be a very good trendy bistro in Paris and I found the food no better perhaps not as good as the Hilton chef. And the service was much better at the Hilton (and the atmosphere infinitely better due to space and quiet and ambiance). I found some of the negative reviews of this hotel overly critical. Yes it can be a bit dark but that is mostly due to its art deco decor - moreover the \"dark\" hallways have rather bright red carpet so I did not find them so dark. Some have mentioned a hard bed - the bed I would describe as \"firm\" rather than hard. Some prefer this - it is not as soft as the pillowtops found in my US hotels but still I found it quite comfortable and I do not like hard beds. In my opinion, the quietness of the room far outweighed the slight firmness of the mattress. The room came with a very large flat screen TV with working remote. There is a fully equipped and well-maintained fitness center in the basement. There is a large business center also fully equipped and staffed. I never called for room service and would honestly recommend going to the restaurant rather than ordering room service. The concierge and bell people are very helpful I always got a taxi immediately and help with my luggage if I wanted it. The front desk speaks both English and French. I spoke french about 60% of the time in the hotel and English about 40% - mainly when it was too complicated for me to understand well in French or when they greeted me in English. I really love the art deco style of this hotel it is special and distinguishes it from other basic Hilton chain hotels.

As a graduation gift and to introduce her to Europe, we did a whirlwind tour of France, Amsterdam and Germany. This was our first stop on our journey. While I typically stay at local, small hotels, I booked Hiltons for the entire trip because (a) I wanted her to have a base she would find comfortable, (b) the online Hilton website is incredibly useful for flexible travel, and (c) as a HHonors member I have grown to trust the Hilton name worldwide. Hilton AdT was no exception. We arrived by bullet-train from Frankfurt. It was MUCH cheaper to fly there 1st class and take a 1st-class seat on the train than to go Heathrow or Charles de Gaul, plus the countryside by train is amazing. I intentionally took the Paris subway for the \"atmosphere\"; but be forewarned it's a long 3 blocks to the hotel if you miss your stop. <grin> And, of course, one must be aware of the current state of strikes. The hotel is breath-taking. Entering is akin to walking into a museum, except from the moment you arrive there is a lobby aide, bell hop, or service person ready and eager to see to your every need. Checkin took mere minutes. A quick stop at the concierge and we had maps and clear guidance for a walking tour of Paris from the generous and knowledgeble staff. Morning breakfast is, simply put, sumptuous. (And, as an HHonors gold member, it was free.) As in all Hiltons, internet access is readily available with a comprehensive business office and kiosk terminals. The rooms are not large, but well designed and laid out. In typical French fashion, rooms look into the gorgeous courtyard. Every hall and the lobby felt warm and inviting due to the artwork and deep, plush decor. Even the modern elevators had the feel of old Paris. Our bed was amazingly comfortable. Complimentary water is carbonated unless you specify otherwise (as is true for most of Europe). The hotel was immaculately clean despite its old-French feel. In fact, we initially tried to book the Hilton close to the Eiffel tower, but it was full -- we feel we found a much better value at Hilton AdT. Paris is a pedestrian city - driving is only for the locals and brave at heart. From this hotel, the Arc de Triomphe is just 14 minutes walk, and from there it is an easy stroll down the Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es to see the Eiffel tower (a must-see at night). Skip the touristy excursion up the Eiffel tower unless you booked dinner reservations a year in advance. Also a must-do is a boat tour on the river Seine. While a dinner boat tour is nice, we found many more romantic opportunities by frequenting the small cafes in the various arondissements and pausing to relax among the gorgeous sculptures of the parks. After visiting Paris, I truly understand why the French surrendered to the Germans... they were protecting their beautiful city! CAUTIONS: Do not, under any circumstances, touch items from the gypsies' displays, or you bought it. Do not give donations or encourage begging. There is a \"scam\" where the gypsies will drop a gold ring or bracelet for you to discover. If you pick it up, you just bought it at their price. LEAVE IT on the ground. In general, completely ignore the gypsies, even if they talk to you. Paris has about 20 districts, or quarters. Plan on visiting 1 or 2 per day and research the districts well ahead of time. Remember that the Louvre is closed on Tuesdays! HIDDEN GEM: Walk out of the main lobby doors, cross the street and go about 500 feet to your left. At this road, turn right and walk another 200 feet to find several local Parisian cafes with the best local breads, pastries and coffee that Paris has to offer! Dinner was just as fabulous without the expense, need for reservations or the congestion of tourists. Taxis are readily available to take you to any district, but I prefered the subway. Just remember to stay aware of rush hour and interruptions and you'll be fine. (Your hotel concierge will guide you in this regard.) In summary, when we return to Paris (as my wife has declared we will), we will return to this hotel.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201ca dark and depressing Paris business hotel\u201d", "Author": "foxbat", "ReviewID": "UR99040329", "Content": "I stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe on March 11.

We arrived late afternoon on a Friday. Were sent immediately to concierge level (husband is Diamond HH) and assigned a suite, an upgrade from the double double we requested to ensure a large room. We pulled our luggage to the room assigned, and 1st thing we noticed was a plate of dirty dishes in front of it, heaped high, not a good sign. Then we entered, or tried to enter, as the cigarette smoke was so intense that I had to cover my nose and try to breathe through my mouth. We backed out of the room, and headed back to the concierge. She suggested using an air purifier (REALLY????) to clear the air. This was supposed to be a non-smoking room- why didn't the maid notify the concierge that there was a problem??? Clean unoccupied rooms apparently were in short supply, so the concierge took us to a room on the 7th floor, room 766. When we checked it out (the concierge was with us), I only remember that it had clean air and a king bed. Being tired, we said okay. After spending a few hours in this room, we found it to be quite small. No storage in the bathroom, barely room to turn around in the bathroom. Teakettle was BEHIND the TV set, making it difficult to access. Half of the bureau was taken up by a small fridge. The next day we requested a room change to the original double double, not caring if we were on a concierge level. None were ready so they asked us to pack our suitcases and leave them in the room. Happily, on our THIRD try we got a decent room on the 3rd floor which had a view of the Eiffel Tower as a bonius. We had access to the EX. lounge. Breakfast was fine, but nothing special. The 3 hot dishes they served never changed, soft scrambled eggs (which I ate), fatty bacon, and overly cooked hash browns (which I didn't eat) Breads were all good. Wait staff and concierge personnel all seemed impersonal and perfunctory. Highlight of the lounge was a terrace where breakfast was enjoyable when the sun was rising. We tried the first night to have dinner at a nearby restaurant but NOTHING was open. As others have said, this hotel is in a business/residential district and there is none of the charm that exists in other parts of Paris. On the 3rd night of our stay as we were getting ready to go to dinner, I went into a sneezing fit- 10 sneezes in a row. Something was bothering my allergies. When we left the room, as we passed the air ducts in the hallway, I made a point of smelling what was coming out.....the odor of perfumed air freshener. When we got home ALL our clothing smelled like the Hilton, so everything had to be washed or dry cleaned. Other reviewers have mentioned mold, one other did mention the chemical smell (read that after the fact, unfortunately). So, I was ill with allergies for ten days after we got back home. Maybe this would not be a problem for some, but anyone with allergies or breathing problems should think twice about booking this hotel. Thank heaven we had the windows open at night which probably delayed my reaction to whatever was being blown into the hallways. BTW, we did not even use Hilton points to stay here. We actually had 4 FREE nights due to frequent stays at Hiltons within a certain time frame. So our bill was ZERO.

The breakfast was not bad, but with some deficiencies, like no live preparation of fresh eggs (how it is almost a must in this category), or like the missing horseradish that must go along with the smoked salmon when offered.

They have done everything right. The rooms are very nice and clean. Everybody there is friendly, helpful, and knows how to speak English. The only US outlet in my room was by the hair dryer, so bring your own adapters. The hotel restaurant was excellent for both dinner and breakfast buffet. The concierge service is excellent. Their restaurant recommendations were excellent. They book the restaurant for you. All you have to do is show up. You won't be disappointed with their recommendations. I'll just mention a few other side things, which mainly have to do with the perceived disadvantage of the hotel's location. The Courcelles metro station is about a 7 minute walk from the hotel. It's slightly uphill but pretty easy to walk to. However, there is a bus stop (line 84) just outside of the hotel, which I found very handy. Get the subway/bus map from a Metro station. I don't know why the concierge doesn't have a map. It's easier to read the compact paper version than online. The machine reader to validate your Paris Visite ticket is just to your left and behind the bus driver. Or if you still don't know where to validate your ticket, ask the driver nicely in French. You can use your ticket to board through the back door when it's crowded, but you must board through the front if you're paying cash. The only bad thing is that the 84 line does not run on Sundays. The display in the bus and a computerized voice system will tell you when you've reached major destinations in French. Push the red button the tell the bus driver to stop. The bus stops also tell you when the next bus will arrive as well with a digital display. It will also notify you about service disruptions and delays in French. Using the bus in Paris isn't like the US where buses serve a different clientele. I don't really see other hotel guests or tourists using the bus, which is a real shame. Try it. You'll like it. There is a grocery store that is open late on R. de Lisbonne just around the corner from the hotel. I can't remember if they close at 10pm or 11pm but it was still later than the other places. You can also walk to the Arc de Triomphe for late night food, but most restaurants near the tourist spots are not that great and not cheap (watch for places with cheap food prices but outrageous non-alcoholic drink prices). Even the McDonalds there is not cheap. Let the hotel concierge book you at a good place instead. Cab fare from most other parts of Paris is about 10-15 euros at the most (I don't take the bus when going to a nice dinner - LOL). If your cab driver does not know the hotel and is using a GPS, use 57 rue de Courcelles (NOT 51 rue de Courelles). 51 does not take you to the right place. Cab fare is about 45 euros to CDG. 10 Euros from the Eurostar/Gare du Nord station. The hotel is not in the middle of the tourist area, but it is not that far from the metro, bus stops, late night food, late night grocery store, etc. And the hotel itself is very, very nice. Overall, I highly recommend staying here.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel - Though wish location were different\u201d", "Author": "DawgmanOH", "ReviewID": "UR89474050", "Content": "The Hilton Arc d'Triomphe provided our family a fantastic stay for 10 days in late November.

We had access to the Executive Lounge and had fantastic treatment from all of the employees who worked up there. The lounge itself was well stocked and provided a great breakfast and evening meals. They were very polite and considerate to our daughter at all times. The only negative things about the room or the hotel itself would be: * Shower is a typical European shower head (meaning it hangs from a cord so you can take it off and rinse all over). However, it is attached to the side of the wall in the bathroom which can make it hard to actually get under the water for a shower. Nothing major, but an annoyance (my wife used a hair band to force it to stay upright that worked ok). * The location, though absolutely safe, shuts down around 19:00. Not many places immediately around for a bite to eat or anything else. The Champs is about a 15 minute walk away which isn't bad, but after a day of touring, it would be great to have something right close by that stayed open past 19:00 - 20:00.

This hotel may not be geared for families with small children who want a tour bus out front and souvenir shops close by, but I loved its quiet elegance in a beautiful district of embassies and private dwellings -- you will love the sloping Mansard roofs that one associates instantly with this city. It is, in short, the essence of Paris as it is lived by Parisians of a somewhat upper economic class. The location is a ten-minute walk from the Arc de Triomphe -- at the top of the famous boulevard called the Champs Elysees -- for which this hotel is named. (If you learn this walk on the first day, you will not consider the distance to be a problem.) The hotel is also only two blocks from a good underground Metro stop, and just minutes from two fashionable shopping streets -- Hausmann Boulevard and the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00c3\u00a9. The hotel neighborhood is dotted with non-touristy carryout shops, food stores, bakeries, bistros, wine shops and tiny store-front restaurants that allow you to live as the Parisians do. Most of the proprietors are friendly and speak enough English to be helpful. Do not hesitate to take your sandwich to the lovely nearby park, the Parc Monceau, which is surrounded with a running track and filled with sculptures and benches for leisurely contemplation and free Wi-Fi. Also in the immediate neighborhood, the exquisite Jacquemart-Andree Museum, inside an 1875 mansion, filled with the original owners' extraordinary personal collection of Renaissance art and furnishings, great for that first jet-lagged afternoon when you're not yet ready to take on the Louvre. The last Paris hotel that Hilton owned was the Hilton Eiffel Tower, and while it was close to the Eiffel Tower itself, it was also across the river from many of the attractions you will want to see, so I prefer this new location. If you're lucky enough to have lots of Hilton Honors points that qualify you for extras, the executive lounge and the complimentary breakfasts are wonderful perks.

I have been to Paris 4 times before so I am now aware of how much a good hotel and great concierge service can add to the memorability and overall experience to one's stay in Paris. The Great: The Front Desk Staff - The man checking us in was very, very nice. When we checked in we asked for a room with a view of the Eiffel Tower and were apologetically told that they only had 7 rooms with that view and they weren't available. We booked entirely using our Hilton points so I didn't expect they would be able to accommodate that request. We checked in at 11am or so, and were told they were cleaning our room and to wait up in the Exec Lounge for a bit. After about 10 minutes they delivered our room key and much to our surprise, we had a room on the top (7th) floor with a view of the Eiffel Tour!! It was a wonderful treat to have that view, especially at night when the tower sparkles for a few minutes at the top of each hour. The Room - View aside, the room was great. It was very spacious (and coming from 2 Americans that says something given how small most European hotel rooms are), it was modern and comfortable. There was a big plasma (or LCD) tv, a writing desk by the window, enough room for 2 big suitcases, a large closet and great bathroom with both a bathtub and glass-enclosed shower. I really enjoyed taking a hot bath at the end of a long day of sight-seeing! The King bed was very comfortable (see note below), and I always got a great nights sleep. The housecleaning staff did a great job getting the room back to perfect every day (except there was an unexplainable wet spot on the carpet by the bathroom on our last day, who knows where that came from). The Concierges - We dealt with 3 concierges during our 4 nights stay, and each gave us dinner recommendations that made our dining experience in Paris the most memorable of any vacation I've taken. They told us to go to Pershing Hall, Le Cantine du Faubourg 105, and Barlotti. Each was truly outstanding and exactly what we were looking for in terms of menu and atmosphere. The concierges even made our dinner reservations and then called the restaurant before we arrived to let them know we were coming. This was the best concierge service I've ever had. The Executive Lounge - We have been to many and this is the best one yet - they were open all day through 11pm or so, and had alcohol, wine, beer, champagne, coffee, and snacks available. They had a different menu every 3 hours so it was worth checking the schedule to know what to expect before going up. I believe I read another review where someone complained that they only had 2 types of cheese to offer..... but most normal, reasonable people in the world will be more than happy with all you can eat and drink - again, including French wine and champagne!!! They even had an outdoor seating area where you could catch a breath of fresh air, smoke a cigar or what have you. We didn't use the hotel bar - we used the exec lounge and drank in our room, but it looked nice (if not a little pricey). We also did not use the spa. The one thing not everyone will like - the Location. My boyfriend and I are early 30s and in good shape and were looking forward to doing a lot of walking, so the less than 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triumphe was certainly reasonable. There were a few metro stations very close by that were on the same like as Montmarte and then South near the Eiffel Tour , and there were several cafes, bars and restaurants within easy walking distance. Granted, this hotel isn't exactly on the Champs Elysee, but it sure is close enough. It has the benefit of being on a quiet street so you can get a good nights sleep, and is much more spacious (and less expensive) than comparable hotels that are in slightly better sight-seeing locations. When we took cabs they were never more than 6-9 Euro or so, even when we were over by Notre Dame.

It was the most amazing breakfast and amazing service I have experienced in the western world. If you live in Paris and want a treat for a weekend brunch, I recommend coming here. As for the rooms - the beds are so comfortable you won't want to leave. Here's my tips for the hotel: 1) Ask for a room that doesn't have a connecting door to the adjacent room. We stayed in one for the first night and it was very noisy so we changed rooms. 2) If you have kids and need them to take naps, discuss with housekeeping when your room will be cleaned. Thy started the cleanings at 9am and finished at 5pm. Our room was always scheduled around 4pm for cleaning. 3) Business Center is free for Hilton Gold members, otherwise it's pricey. 4) Internet is free for Hilton Gold members, otherwise it's pricey. 5) If you're staying here for 2 or more nights then it would be a wise decision to pay the annual fee for the American Express Hilton Card that gives you Gold membership before you go. 6) The bar and restaurant are expensive. **7**) If you usually use Hilton Status for an upgrade to the executive floor, just this one time, turn it down and opt for the complimentary breakfast vouchers instead - just trust me on this one!", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Island Height, NJ", "Title": "\u201cMade the difference in our visit\u201d", "Author": "ReneB", "ReviewID": "UR81614737", "Content": "I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel the staff was wonderful and very helpful with train reservations and dinner suggestions and reservations.

They have a small Thalospa with a steamroom and jacuzzi. Not many people in it so even though its small, its fine. There is a gym also (small also but fine) and they have the usual massages etc. Connection to the internet is not free ... costs about 8.50 per hour or you can buy a 24 hour connection for approx. 24 Euro. Get a good map of Paris .. there are lots of tiny streets and you can get lost easily. The locals are not good at giving directions so you are on your own! Taxis are relatively cheap. The tour bus which you will see around the city, is a good way to introduce you to all the sites and stops outside the key attractions - its about 40 Euro per person and is 2 hours all in but you can hop on and off and the pass lasts for 2 days.

We chose this hotel based on the mainly good reviews on Tripadvisor, an excellent stay at the Hilton Waldorf, London in Oct 2009, and the fact that the rooms both had two double beds in them. As a family of five we always have to book 2 rooms in Europe and even then our daughter usually has to sleep on a roll up bed. By booking double doubles we thought that we would enjoy a bit of luxury on the last two nights of a 3 week holiday that we had mainly spent staying in a mobile home in Italy. On arrival the doormen were friendly and helpful and reception found our reservation promptly and directed us to the dedicated executive level check-in on the 6th floor. It was all downhill from here! We stood in the lift pressing the 6th floor button but nothing happened so we got out and got in another lift but this one did not move either. A member of staff then got in and rather huffily showed us that we had to swipe our key in the lift after pressing the 6th floor button otherwise nothing happens, why was this not mentioned at reception? On the 6th floor my husband tried to check in and it then transpired that there were no double double rooms available even though we had booked these that morning! We were instead given a suite and a standard double on the 2nd floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not very convenient for the executive lounge and definitely not what we booked. The executive lounge manager described this as an upgrade, but while the suite probably was an upgrade, our double was definitely a down grade and neither room had a balcony. The suite had a bedroom, a sitting room and 2 bathrooms. However, this room was for the children and so, as usual, my daughter ended up sleeping on the sofa bed which was not put away by housekeeping for the duration of our stay. Our double room was a reasonable size (although not as big as a double double!) and was nicely decorated. However, it had numerous faults, there was a noise of constant dripping water from the toilet which we reported to maintenance. It was fixed quickly but the repair lasted about 10 minutes, in the end I repaired it myself! There were no tea & coffee making facilities in our room, we had to borrow them from the suite. No hairdryer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again we had to borrow from the suite, the bathroom was very small so when the bathrobe was hanging up it was practically dangling in the toilet. The beds were not particularly comfortable and we did not get a turndown service on either night although the suite (immediately next door) did! No chocolate Eiffel towers for us! The housekeeping was probably the worst we have had in any hotel, it was difficult to tell if the room had been cleaned or not and tea, coffee and toiletries were not replaced. The TV lost the picture approx every 10 mins for about 30 seconds each time which was infuriating. We took the included dinner on the first night in the terrace restaurant, again the matter of some debate as the hotel did not have a record of this offer! We were provided with vouchers that entitled us to a varied and interesting menu, with further choices available for a few extra euros. The food was excellent as was the service. The next morning we went down to the main breakfast room to be interegated as to whether we wanted the buffet breakfast or the full breakfast, and if we had breakfast included had we brought our vouchers with us? What vouchers for goodness sake! This hotel is obsessed with vouchers! Surely a four star hotel can see who has booked what without resorting to a vouchers system that would only work if they gave their guests the relevant vouchers in the first place! We said that our vouchers were in our room and we would bring them down for inspection later (no chance!) and were allowed into the breakfast room where the buffet breakfast and the full breakfast appeared to be the same anyway! There was plenty of choice although a few of the items, particularly the pancakes, took a long time to be replaced. Cooked items such as bacon, mushrooms and rather perculiar chicken sausages were available on the buffet so the mystery of what constituted a full breakfast will never be solved! Around lunchtime we returned to the hotel for the lunch snacks served in the executive lounge. We had just helped ourselves to a few sandwiches, crudit\u00c3\u00a9s etc when we were informed by the lounge attendant that children under 12 were not allowed in the 6th floor executive lounge but were instead requested to use the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd executive lounge! We were not told this when we booked (we had used the executive lounge at the Hilton Waldorf London for 4 days without any problems and assumed that the facility would be the same in Paris) or when we checked in at the executive lounge, and it was not mentioned in the printed executive lounge information sheet given to us on arrival detailing the opening hours of the lounge etc. In fact the only place this was mentioned was in small type on a notice by the door of the lounge. Our youngest child is 10 and the other two are 12 and 16, all they wanted to do was have something to eat and read the lounge newspapers, why were we embarrassed and told to use the family lounge in future? Later in the afternoon we decided to give the family lounge a go. This turned out to be a conference room with tables and chairs laid out a bit like a school dining hall. There was one sofa and a couple of easy chairs and a TV showing what appeared to be a horror film! In one area of the room were a few plastic slides, plastic toddler toys etc. It reminded me of going to play groups which I had not been too for at least 7 years and really did not want to be forced to go to when paying four star prices for supposedly executive lounge perks! The food was fairly mediocre, there was soup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or rather a empty soup tureen which did not get refilled the whole time we were in the lounge, and pasta with a tomato based sauce. I helped myself to the pasta only to find there was no sauce, I waited at least 10 minutes for the sauce to be replenished, by which time my pasta was cold, I went to get some pasta and of course there was none left! My husband decided to voice his complaints to the guest relations manager. He listened politely, agreed that these things should not be happening in a four star hotel and said he would send a bottle of champagne and drinks for the children up to our room to try and make amends. While this was a nice gesture I would have rather had what I thought I had booked in the first place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2 double doubles, a balcony and a relaxing executive lounge. When the drinks arrived there were only 2 drinks and 2 glasses for 3 children! On Sunday morning my husband decided to go and settle the bill before breakfast to try and avoid the rush. He discovered that the hotel were trying to charge us for the full cost of the first nights meal as, yet again, they had no record of the meal inclusive rate. The clerk said that he needed to go and check all the restaurant receipts for that night and if he could find a signed receipt for the full amount we would have to pay! My husband said for him to go ahead as he was not in any rush and he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to find one!. After 5 minutes the clerk had to admit defeat. In conclusion, after the many good reviews on this site about this hotel, we were disappointed with everything apart from the restaurant and its staff and the doormen. There was nothing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153executive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about our stay and we would certainly not recommend the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153executive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd level to families with children older than 5 because, apart from a bit of mediocre food, there is no advantage to paying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153executive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rates to attend a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playgroup. This really must be highlighted when booking. We certainly won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be returning and we would hesitate to book another Hilton hotel.

I have to say that before making the booking (3 months in advance) i joined the hilton honnors program and i booked a family room with two queen beds. I also had requested a high floor and non-smoking. As soon as we approached the check-in counter the girl who was behind (after giving her our reservation details and member card) smiled and said. Well he have two surprises for you today. First surprise was two very nice presents for my girls, appropriate for their age each, and wrapped in beautiful christmas papers. Before we had the time to thank her she said and now the second surprise is that because we were not able to honor your request for a high floor and a view we are upgrading you to a lovely two room suite with club access!! We were ecstatic, my husband kept asking if they're going to ask us to pay the difference, but no it was all complimentary. I am sorry i don't remember the name of that sweet girl at check in but i am very thankful to however took the decision to upgrade as, as this made the rest of our trip to Paris so special. The suite was on the first floor and had an inner courtyard view (beautifully decorated for Christmas) and it was stunning! Two separate rooms with a door in between, one was the main bedroom with huge and comfy king size bed and it's own private bathroom (bathtub and shower and every toiletry you could imagine, even bath salts) and the other room had a double sofa bed, with it's own bathroom too, two huge plasma tv's in each room, bathrobes and slippers of very high quality for the whole family, of course they offered turn down service with chocolate, i don't think i've stayed or will ever stay in a more plush or luxurious hotel room and i'm glad my girls had the chance to experience that too!

She arranged a beautiful room on the top floor with a terrace and view of the Eiffel Tower for us which was just great! The hotel, rather ugly outside and a little out of the way for the casual tourist, is absolutely stunning inside!

The concierge desk was very helpful, the bellmen and doormen very pleasant and efficient and the whole hotel seemed to run like a well-oiled machine.

The Parc Monceau is close by but really holds no attraction - sadly it seems to be populated with homeless people. We were told it was safe but it was not pleasant to walk, much less sit, in the park.

Further complicating things is the fact that many Hiltons outside the U.S. will not allow you to book 3 people in a room when using points. As a result, the first night we had only 1 bed and I slept on the floor. The hotel redeemed itself by supplying a roll-away bed for the balance of the stay at no charge. Room was still small for 2 people with limited closet and drawer space for an extended stay. Our room was clean and appeared to have been recently upgraded with a flat-screen TV and good lighting. I would say that having access to the Executive Lounge saved this hotel for us. Having access to free breakfast, afternoon drinks and snacks, and evening cocktails saves an enormous amount of money in a city like Paris. That being said, charging 21 Euro for 24 hours of Internet service in the Executive Lounge is insulting.

I was somewhat taken aback that the \"main\" executive lounge has a sign advising that it is limited to children over the age of 13 (including for breakfast). However, children were present and this seems not a problem. I did mention it to the staff at one point because my children were a little \"old\" for the family executive lounge and the staff person was very understanding.

If you get passes to the \"main\" breakfast room, I recommend this over either of the executive lounges.

Our room had two very comfortable queen beds. The mattresses were new and fairly firm. The AC worked great and it was not too loud. All staff members were friendly and spoke excellent English. So why am I underwhelmed? I had dinner one night in their restaurant and thought it was nothing special. I order the pasta of the day. It was supposed to come with shrimp (at least the server said so when I asked) yet when the dish was brought to my table there was no shrimp in it. I had to flag him down to get some shrimp (he was pretty busy and once the food was dropped off he had no intention of coming of back until we finished eating), which he told me was not his fault but would have some cooked right away for me. My friend ordered the club sandwich and the bacon came out burnt. This tells me that the restaurant is not really as good as it claims to be. Also, I really did not like the location. There is something of a running battle about whether this hotel has a good location or not in the reviews below. I like a hotel that is central to all of the sights or at least has lots of things to do around it. There weren't too many restaurants nearby and no bakeries, souvenir shops, or cheese shops. Yes, it is close to the metro but not so good if you just want to hang outside. At $300-$500 per night, I would stay elsewhere in Paris.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel.

We used Hilton Hhonors points to book the room, and the purpose of our trip was leisure/sightseeing. Our experience was positive. The location of the hotel was perfectly satisfactory for us. It was not in a high tourist area, but we mastered both the bus and the metro in a day and found both accommodated us well. It was a two block walk to the blue 2 metro line that connected easily at Etoille to get to many tourist destinations, and the 30 bus had stops right there as well. The 84 bus stopped maybe 50 yards from the hotel and ran right past Madeline, Concorde, Bon Marche, St. Sulpice and to the Pantheon in the middle of the left bank. There were always taxis available outside the door. As for the location of the real ADT, ten, maybe fifteen minutes to walk. We went after dinner one night, just at sunset, turning left out of the hotel and taking the first left on Avenue Hoche. As soon as you make the turn you can see it, so it is not as if you wonder where it is. Hoche also leads you directly to the pedestrian underpass to go to the top. We never ate in the hotel restaurant, and there weren't a lot of restaurants nearby. Directly across the street was one called Le Pantheon, I believe, but we passed it without stopping. If you went left out of the hotel and in about twenty yards took your first right and walked down rue de Lisbonne half a block there was a small Monoprix express on the right where you could buy some groceries, premade sandwiches, wine and liquor. There was a pharmacie in the second building to the left of the hotel. We found all of the folks we encountered at the hotel worked hard to assist the guests in any way they could. Twice two different staff members used the phrase \"anything is possible\" when we made a request. We found there to be a terrific can-do attitude with everyone we encountered. We used the concierge on the main floor next to the reception desk several times. I was impressed with Julien Barral in particular; he made dinner reservations for us on Monday for Tuesday night as we were heading out, and on Tuesday when we asked him to do the same for Wednesday he remembered both my name and room number. While I was standing there he would pick up the phone, a flurry of French ensued, he would hang up and pronounce \"voila,\" and our reservation was done. We were upgraded to the seventh (top) floor on our arrival. The room faced west and out and overlooked the 2nd floor rooftop garden of an adjoining building. We had a small balcony, but no chairs. The room was rather small by American standards, and the roof on the outer wall leaned in (there is an architectural term for this that I can't think of), making the total cubic feet (or meters) of the room smaller than if the wall went straight to the ceiling. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room so this wasn't an issue for us. It also gave the room a certain European feel that we wouldn't get here in the states. Everything worked in the room. Although the bathroom was rather small there was plenty of counter space for his and hers toiletries. The bed was firm and not as comfortable as the Suite Dreams mattress used here in the States (and in our home as we have purchased one we like it so much), but we had no issues sleeping. We left the door to the balcony open a few evenings and it was nice to sleep with fresh air and there was no noise to speak of to disturb us. We had three pillows when we arrived and got the \"anything is possible\" response the first time when we asked for a fourth. The room contained both a minibar with a small area for personal use, and a safe, both of which came in handy. There was a hairdryer in one of the dresser drawers. I had understood that there was an American style plug in the bathroom (but that it was at 220 volts), but ours had two European style outlets and no American style. I am a diamond level Hhonors member, and most of the rest of my comments will pertain to the Executive Level lounge. As either a diamond or because our room was on the Executive level (6th and 7th floors, need a key card to access), we were entitled to use the Executive lounge. This was great. We were able to have breakfast every day before setting out, and some evenings we circled back through the hotel and had a drink and some hors d'ouvres before going out to dinner. We were never in the hotel between 9 am and 5 pm so I have no idea what is available in the middle of the day. If I had any complaint it would be that the offerings were the same every single day; no 'if it's Tuesday we're having sausage instead of bacon.' There were three hot plates every morning, one with scrambled eggs, one with bacon and one with round potato patties. The eggs were generally runny (do they put cream in them? we wondered) but if you used the serving spoon to scrape the bottom of the dish or even better in the corner between the bottom and the wall they were firmer. If you wanted crispy bacon you had to dig, too. There were some plates with cheeses, meats and smoked salmon every morning, yogurt, a bowl of fresh fruit (but never bananas), and two tables with breads. There were some fluffy croissants, pain a chocolate, sandwich bread, baguettes, and peanut butter and nutella. Around the corner were pitchers with five different kinds of juice. You could either make your own coffee, espresso or cappuccino from the machine or one of the staff members working in the lounge would bring it out to you. Small jars of jams or honey were on each table. There were about seven tables (twos and fours) outside on the long, narrow balcony, lots of tables inside, and some stools along a bar around the edge of one end of the room. We only had an issue one morning finding a place to sit as we were later than normal, so we sat European style taking two seats at a table for four that had another couple sitting at it. We ended up having a nice conversation with them. There was a concierge desk in the lounge, and the gals who worked it were knowledgeable and helpful. When we told the one working the night before we left that it was our last night she said we could even check out there in the morning. The folks clearing the tables were courteous and helpful to a fault, and would stop everything they were doing if you let them know they had run out of plates or forks and go get them. In the evening the lounge had at least three different kinds of wine (red, white, Champagne) and an array of liquor and liquors. If the bottle of Johnnie Walker was empty a staff member would gladly go get another. There were hors d'ouvres every night, and like breakfast if I had a complaint it would be that they, too, were always the same as well. But who is complaining when you are having a couple of free drinks before going out to dinner? We never used the spa. I do not know if its use would have been still included under the executive floor upgrade or not, and never asked. There were two bathrobes in our room for wearing to the spa, however. We had a really great time staying at the Paris Hilton ADT. I thought it was an exceptional use of points; at one time I checked the rate and it would have cost us over $3,000 for the same stay. The location worked for us, the physical facilities were entirely satisfactory, and the staff, from the concierge to the maid who was coming down the hall to turn down our bed just as we arrived from a day of sight seeing, all seemed to understand they were working in the business of hospitality. As we left my wife asked when we could come back. Not soon enough, I thought. We had a great stay.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "missouri", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay\u201d", "Author": "jmf3", "ReviewID": "UR67854807", "Content": "I selected this hotel based on the good reviews on Trip Advisor and I wasn't disappointed. My friend, her 18 year old daughter, my 18 year old daughter and I stayed here from June 8-14, 2010. We had spent the previous week in London and then two nights in Normandy before arriving here. We were very stressed upon arrival as we had just driven our rental car, through central Paris, back to the Gare du Nord train station and then caught a taxi to the hotel. We were exhausted. The staff, beginning with the gentleman who met our cab at the curb, were very courteous and helpful. Once inside, we were offered an upgrade to a suite for 100 Euros/night. As we were staying on points, I declined because we hadn't planned to spend any money. We were then offered the upgrade for 50 Euros a night. Marion, the very kind woman at the desk, explained that for a small amount, we would get a two room, two bath suite and access to the Executive Lounge throughout our entire 6 night stay. She wasn't pushy, but saw that we were stressed and very patiently made it clear what a good deal this was. So we accepted, and I'm very glad that we did. Our rooms were beautiful. One room was enormous and had a king sized bed. The connecting room was also large and had a queen sized pullout couch. Each room had a large marble bathroom and a 42\" flat screen TV. We also faced south and had a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. We ended up saving a lot of money throughout the week by utilizing the Executive Lounge. It was a large beautiful room and had a balcony with tables where you could sit as well. The meals were the same each day; breakfast was scrambled eggs, bacon and hash browns along with all kinds of pastry, fruit, coffee and juices. Lunch was light sandwiches, but we were rarely there for that. Dinner each night was some kind of pasta with a choice of sauces plus soup. And there was always plenty of fruit, cheese, pastries and, my favorite...soda. Although the food was pretty much the same each day, it was still delicious and we appreciated the convenience and savings. I'd read in some of the reviews that the Lounge staff were unkind or unprofessional. We didn't experience that at all. Everyone was very friendly and the service was wonderful. We enjoyed conversations in both English and French with a number of the staff. The location of the hotel was excellent. It was a 5 minute walk from the Courcelles Metro station, but we rarely used it because we could walk to the Arc de Triomphe in about 15 minutes. We loved being near the Arc and the Champs Elysees. The neighborhood was beautiful and we felt very safe there. Our room faced another building which housed a daycare center. We could hear the children each morning, but it didn't bother us. And if you kept the window closed, you wouldn't hear it at all. We could hear a clock chime the hour somewhere nearby and we really liked that. I subscribed to Boingo Global internet service during our trip so I could stay connected to my family at home without paying exorbitant hotel internet fees. This hotel was a Boingo hotspot and I was able to connect without a problem.

The location is also perfect if you do not mind a little walking but if you are in Paris you should be thinking like that to begin with. The Arc and Champs was only 15 minutes walking and there were plenty of restaurants around the hotel, including Starbucks 10 minutes away, so this was all good.

My husband and I are Elite members Hilton Grand Vacation Club and Gold HHonors members. We have stayed here 4 to 5 times previously with prior trip last August. I have never written a review but decided it was time. I traded my Hilton Grand Vacation points for an 8 nite stay. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and I was welcomed back and thanked for my Hilton loyalty. I was advised we were being upgraded to the Exeuctive Floor. An Executive Room comes with access to the executive lounge which provides food and drinks on and off all day til 11pm. Breakfast in the lounge consists of fresh breads, eggs, bacon, potatoes, pastries, cheeses, fruits, cereals etc. There's a large cafe/expresso machine, teas, cold drinks and juices available. As soon as breakfast is over there are small tea sandwiches such as cucumber/ cream cheese or salmon, chips, nuts, veggie sticks and dips etc. Later there's afternoon tea, wine and snacks just enough to satisfy between meals. As we arrived 10AM our room was not ready so we headed out. When we returned around 4 pm we were checked into our room. Our room had 2 queen beds which were very comfortable. The bathroom is smaller but very nice and totally adequate for us. My only request would be an outlet for a curling iron. There is a mini bar, safe, large cupboard with shelves for storage with a flat screen tv on top, iron and ironing board. I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival requesting lots of extra hangers for 3 women and a coffee/tea maker. I received a very nice email next day telling me housekeeping would be happy to take care of my request. I also asked about my new alarm clock I had forgotten on my August trip. Would you believe they said it was located and would be in my room on arrival and it was. There are also 2 chairs, a small table and a nice desk and chair with internet/computer hookup. I know internet daily rates are terrible but the business center is great. It was 10 euro for a card with 30 or 45 minutes, can't remember. I checked my email several days on this. Our room looked out on the courtyard all in bloom with the most beautiful purple and pink flowers. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Champs Elysee down Franklin Roosevelt to the Grand Palais/Petite Palais area. It is about a 15/20 minute walk to the Opera Garnier and Galeries Lafayette and Printemps department stores. Galeries Lafayette has a huge grocery and several places to grab a bite or drink as does Printemps. The hotel is located in a quiet residential area near Parc Monceau. There are few options for restaurants surrounding hotel but if you walk more toward Opera there are lots of places in the vacinity. There are always taxis waiting out front. Fares as far as the Louvre were about 8 Euro which included a tip. We did not use the metro but it was only a short 5 minute walk from the hotel. If you like to walk you can walk from the hotel to anywhere just wear good shoes. I'd say walking to the Louvre would be about 45 minutes or so. Paris is a beautiful walkable city with soooooo!! many sights. I cannot say enough about the wonderful staff. Everyone we encountered couldn't have been more pleasant and accomodating from the front desk staff to the bellmen, the concierge, wait staff and servers, housekeeping and business center. Everyone had a smile on their face when approached and were always willing to help. Wait staff in the executive lounge even remembered how one takes their coffee each morning before being asked. Just remember to always try and approach someone with Bonjour or Bonsoir Madame/Monsiuer before you start a conversation. 99% of the time you will always receive a smile and a warm greeting back. Remember you are in their country so try and learn a few words before you go. Some hotel staff do not speak Englsh such as our room housekeeper. It was just nice to speak a few words to her even if it was just Good Morning or Good Evening Madame. A smile does wonders.

Recommend getting the room & Breakfast package opton as there is only the breakfast buffet available (no alacarte) and it is hugely expensive at 33 euros/person for the full and 22 euros for the continental. Room service has alcarte but is again expensive and there is a 4 euro add on. We were upgraded to a courtyard room and this had to be the quetest hotel room I have ever stayed in and the hotel was busy! Beautiful art deco design. King bed in a 30 sq meter room with bath with tub and separate shower. Hotel is in a location that is about a 15 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe and about 5 to 10 minutes to a lot of restaurants and brasseries. Restaurants do not usually open until 7:30 but the brasseries are open pretty well all day. ATM is right down the street but was broken and others are within a few minutes walk. You will probably need to walk a lot in Paris anyway so location is not an issue. Taxi stand at the front door always had cabs in attendance even in the early morning. All cabs require a minimum 6 euros per trip. Dinners in the hotel's Safran restaurant were OK but not outstanding as I sort of expected all good restaurants in Paris would provide. The night we arrived my wife had the pasta special of the day which was not to her liking at all. Little to much creativity in the kitchen I believe as it was heavily coriander flavoured.

We had booked a suite but the room we were allocated surpassed all our expectations with one of the best views of the Eiffel Tower we could have asked for. The bathroom with a jacazzi and shower cubicle helped to make our stay memorable The service in the hotel is extremely friendly and the staff treat everyone with respect and consideration even those who speak no French at all. The hotel is in walking distance of the Metro but a fair walk from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysee. However taxis from the hotel are however readily available and Paris taxi prices seem reasonable to a Londoner. We ate twice in Le Safran restaurant for dinner and had very enjoyable meals. The deserts were outstanding, particularly the Creme Brulee and by Paris prices not outrageous. The waiters were knowledgable, very helpful, in particular Emilie. Breakfast was certainly the best we have had on the mainland of Europe. The pastries of course were wonderful, but to find a hotel that has quality French Toast, makes Ice Coffee, provide passable Silver Dollar pancakes and Sunny Side Eggs and much more to order is unusual . At 33 euros per person it can be expensive so I would suggest a breakfast inclusive rate.. The Executive Lounge is great and provides a buffet breakfast which is not as bountiful as Le Safran but perfectly adequate when it is complimentary to occupants of the Executive Floor. Snacks and beverages are provided most of the day. We particularly like afternoon tea on the terrace.. All in all with service we received after many visits to Paris this was our best hotel stay.

There were many guests from the USA and I can only imagine how they must feel if they are put into a room like this. In addition to this, the rooms were located directly above the kitchen service areas so most of our night was disturbed by bins of glass bottles being noisily emptied and general noise. We stayed at the old Hilton in Paris by the Eiffel Tower many times and the views from the rooms there were just breathtaking and everything which any visitor to the city would appreciate. On one morning we reported to the Executive Lounge for breakfast, only to find a long queue outside and a member of staff handing out vouchers for breakfast in the main restaurant to compensate. We accepted the vouchers but I can only describe the experience of breakfast as being similar to a Butlins holiday camp in the 1960's! The room was noisy, chaotic and over crowded. The pressure on the staff was such that, when we went to the buffet for our main items, we came back to the table to find that the staff had cleared away our juice, coffee and tea, breads and pastries which were clearly untouched! We had to stand about with plates in our hands until the table was completely reset. In some ways this was not bad as, on the first setting the waitress was in such a rush she did not bother to find a proper lid for the teapot and balanced an ill fitting saucer on top of it instead. I accept that the overall standards of this hotel, superficially, are much better than the old Hilton by the Eiffel Tower.

Its actually located further north of the Champs Elysee, in a blissfully calm and quiet neighborhood. This is great after a day of touring, but it does means you have to venture a few blocks to find food, as the surrounding buildings don't feature many restaurants or cafes. My husband and I love to walk, so we found the location to be no problem, and we walked to the Seine to use the Batobus to get around. A metro stop is also close by. We stayed for five nights and never found it necessary to call a taxi. To get to and from the airport, we took the Air France shuttle, and the walk from the shuttle stop (right off of L'Etiole) was easy, even with our luggage. Rooms and Decor: The hotel decor is art deco, with a cute courtyard and a trendy bar. Our room was very large (by European standards), with a separate shower and tub in the marble bathroom. We had a room on the top floor, and the balcony had a view of the Eiffel Tower, great for viewing its lights at night. Logistics and Staff: The hotel stay was a wedding gift from my parents (who have many, many Hilton points). Without these points, this hotel would be absolutely out of our budget, and I imagine this is the case for many travelers. Having traveled to many Hilton hotels in the US and Europe, I think this is probably one of the best value for points that I've experienced, and I highly recommend the hotel to anyone with Hilton Honors points considering a stay in Paris. There was some mix up on the reservation (we think because it was booked by my parents), which resulted in us being checked out before we even arrived! However, the staff was beyond accommodating, fixing the problem before we even realized what happened. We even found a bouquet of flowers in the room on our second day as an apology! Executive Floor Lounge: Since we stayed on points, we had access to the executive floor lounge, which serves breakfast, drinks, and snacks. We had breakfast there several mornings, and it was a great light meal to start the day with. We often stopped for drinks and snacks (think crudites and mini-croque monsieur sandwiches). The staff was professional if not friendly, and caught on to our drink preferences quickly.

The location of the hotel is fairly good as walking distance to the Champs Elysee, but not slap bang in the busy area so I think is a good balance of being handy but quiet and out of the madhouse. The rooms are fairly large with big comfortable bed, good working space and then an unusual bathroom thing where the basin (an art deco inspired green basin) is in a small passageway which also has the cupboard. So it can be a bit clumsy. Then into the bathroom and toilet area. The water pressure is not great and the shower is okay buy not very strong. There is a very large TV with a good selection of channels, especially for English speakers - though there are actually more english channels if you flick through the channels than rely on those listed via the menu as english language (there are BBC1, BBC2, CBBC for example also available but not listed). The breakfast is a really good spread but costs 22 Euros if you not got it in your rate. But the service is fast and very friendly. In the evening the restaurant, which is very large, serves a good range of food with many very good fish dishes and nice wines. The staff again is attentive and helpful. There is a fairly well equipped fitness centre that seems quite busy, along with a spa. The hotel is very popular for meetings and during the day is full of business types.

Then another hour, they told us that the room had been vacated since 9am (and now at about noon time), but since we asked for no smoking and that we had mentioned our child had asthma, they were cleaning it well. Which was a lie because it couldn't have been that long to clean it. When we finally got our room, we didn't see anything special at all. It wasn't cleaned the way they told us they would've had. And after waiting, with 2 kids that were so tired from the trip, they gave us a room that overlooked a wall and was really an ugly view. We weren't very happy with the room but they didn't have another room until 2 days later if we changed rooms. The room's lamp didn't work, and the some of the lights were broken...A few days later, we got our room, which was not an upgrade but better view and at least the lights were working. The rooms are pretty good and if there are 4 of you, this is the only hotel that had 2 full size beds. For Paris hotels, I would say they are quite roomy, but in US standards, they are still of course small. Don't bother to ask for upgrade not unless you are a Platinum level. We were only silver but I would say Hilton points are the best in the world. We got the whole week on points. As silver level, we weren't even offered breakfast while waiting at the lobby with young kids and to think we were waiting for more than 3 hours!! A week before we arrived in Paris, I requested the guest services if they could do something for my husband who was going to celebrate his b-day in Paris. We have exchanged messages and had set up a plan to send us a cake and champagne. That was really nice and we got it in theafternoon. Also if you travelling with the kids, they do get gifts upon check in like hats and t-shirts that had the hotel's logo in it. We had dinner at the restaurant one night, The Saffran. The food was quite good and the service was excellent. A little expensive but it was convenient. In terms of restaurants around the hotel, there weren't too many but if you walked about 10-15 min towards Champs Ellysees, you will find a ton...There is a little market very close by, where you can get wines, cheeses, fruits, drinks, etc. It's the mini Prix. If you see a cafe across the hotel, go toward it and keep walking pass it. In about, a few min. you'll see the market. One night we bought a bottle of Bordeux, salami, cheese for my husband and I, and sandwiches and apples for the kids. The wines are cheap (about 2-3 euros).. Just ask the bellhops that hang around the front door for any directions and they will be happy to tell you. I used the concierge once but I didn't think they were that helpful.

Likewise, food and drink are exorbitant - unless you're on an expense account, you'll be eating and drinking elsewhere. (2) The location is not very convenient to the major attractions. On a future visit, I would try to stay in a more \"happening\" area. The walk back to the hotel at night was rather dreary. The nearest metro stop, Courcelles, only services one line so you'll find yourself trekking to the metro stop at the Arc de Triomphe (Charles de Gaulle, 15-20 minutes away) that connects with a number of lines. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, mainly because the price was right :) and the service was impeccable.

It was beautifully decorated, from the lobby to our room. Everything was extremely clean and the staff was very helpful when we had questions. While we didn't spend too much time in the room (too much to do and see in Paris) it was nice to know that at night we had a great place to get a good nights sleep to be ready for the next day. Check-in was fast and easy and they made check-out work with our schedule. Their check-out time was noon, but weren't leaving the city until 8 pm that night, they held all of our luggage safely until we were ready to actually leave.

The housekeeping is great, the room was always immaculate after the staff visited. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bath had good storage. Our room was quiet since it overlooked their pretty interior garden (deluxe king). We had a lounge chair and a desk, and we thought it was very ample. The art deco theme is very well done with great attention to detail. I almost felt like were in an old movie. We always had plenty of towels, thick plush robes and soaps/shampoos. The TV, flat screen, was big and worked well. About 6 channels in English. The layout of the room was very well designed. i really liked being able to open the window and get the latest weather without going downstairs. The staff spoke English, its air conditioned and there were ice machines on every floor which we appreciated as Americans. We had dinner one night in the hotel restaurant, and enjoyed it very much (3 courses with wine 100 euro for 2). Breakfast is a very lavish brunch like buffet for 33 euros (22 euros for deluxe continental). The location is in a residential/business area. A great plus is that the hotel is on rue de Courcelles, directly on the #84 bus a few steps outside the door. The bus goes directly to Madeleine, Concorde, or the left bank (St. Sulpice). The metro is a 5 minute walk (Courcelles) which goes directly to Montmartre, or Arc de Triomphe. Its a short walk (approx 10 minutes) on Ave. Hoche to the Arc de Triomphe and the restaurants of the Champs Elysses. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful, its 19th century Paris. We appreciated the calm after a day of sightseeing. There is a ATM across the street a half block. Concierge desk was very helpful. They had good restaurant recommendations and printed out maps of how to walk there. Enjoyed the nightly turndown service with Laduree chocolates and the weather forecast. When we ordered a taxi for the airport, they looked up which terminal we needed to go to, a very nice touch. One tiny drawback is the waste basket in the bathroom is a little small by US hotel room standards. Also, we did not have a coffee maker in our room (probably that feature is not done in France), but the restaurant was happy to serve me a cup.

It is difficult to say how we would have felt were we paying full price for each night, but we were absolutely thrilled with every aspect of our stay. The lobby of the hotel is huge and lovely. The images on the website simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it justice. It smells of fresh lilies all day long. But the best part of entering the Hilton was the incredibly warm welcome we received. We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a move without being offered assistance and guidance in flawless English. The concierge was particularly helpful. My husband visited the concierge desk several times during our stay, and each time he was helped by a new staff person, each of whom was courteous and knowledgeable. We expressed interest in taking a cruise on the Seine, and the gentleman helping us not only pointed out a company he knew of, but was able to sell us the tickets himself so we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait in line. The hotel room was significantly larger than we expected in such a desirable location. The bathroom in particular was a relief, with a lovely deep tub and a roomy stall shower. Perhaps if we had paid the full $500 per night we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been quite so surprised by the space, but as it was, the room felt every bit like a resort! Breakfast was included in our stay. We likely wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have tried it otherwise, given the 33 euro per person price tag. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very glad we were able to experience the splendor of the Hilton breakfast. We were greeted by a sweet Parisian lady each morning, and she remembered our name after day one. Breakfast was a massive buffet of hot and cold dishes, with a full aisle of pastries and bread. A friendly waiter comes by with tea, coffee and the freshest most fragrant orange juice I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever encountered. We lingered in the mornings, reading the complimentary copies of the International Herald Tribune, Financial Times, and The Economist. If I had stayed healthy, we would probably remember this hotel simply as a lovely hotel in a lovely city. But on the morning we planned to fly back to the US, I woke up viciously sick and unable to catch our plane. My husband rushed down to the concierge, who helped him make the necessary calls to change our flights. They put through the calls from the desk, without charging us for the long distance (which normally would have been outrageously priced through the hotel). We needed to stay an additional night, and the front desk let us extend our reservation at the discounted price we had obtained online, which they had absolutely no obligation to do. Finally, when my husband made it to breakfast after all of this, the friendly woman who greeted each morning noticed my husband was alone and asked after me. Upon hearing I was sick, she proceeded to find several Tupperware containers for him to use to bring me breakfast when I was recovered.

The shower, and the entire bathroom setup, was wonderful and was very relaxing. The bed was very comfortable. The service we received from the staff was amazing and we felt very welcome during our brief stay. The next morning, we enjoyed the \"Hilton Breakfast\" (free due to our HHonors status level) that was, quite simply, awesome. The spread available for breakfast is very extensive and very delicious. Even if you need to pay for it, which looked to be pretty expensive, it's worth it. It's really that good. We checked out right around noon and left our luggage with the concierge for storage, with no issues.

The pictures of the exterior of the hotel don't do it justice. If you are a Hilton Honors member, do yourself a favor and do whatever it takes to gain access to the Executive lounge. It is unbelievable. Every morning a full breakfast that will meet any person's needs. I loved the eggs, salmon, yogurt, unlimited cappuccino, sparkling water, etc. All gratis with access to the lounge. But it doesn't end there. At lunchtime they will change the rotation to include small sandwiches, chips, cookies, cakes, cokes. At dinner the rotation changes to include alcohol (full liquor options, beer, wine). I never worked out whether or not we were supposed to tip - it didn't look like most people did. I'm traditionally a very generous tipper so I felt guilty about basically never doing it save for our room attendant. The room itself was very nice - we had a leak from our AC unit (I think) in the bathroom that was annoying and one night the guy had to come in at 11PM to drain it. Other than that everything was great. The 10 minute walk to the Arc/Etoile Metro station got to be a drag on the 6th and 7th days, but sometimes we could catch the Courcelles station (only 2 blocks away but only serviced 1 line). Overall I would rate this as a 4.5 star hotel. Definitely exceeded my expectations in every imaginable way. If you use iPass there is a wired hookup so I was able to use my work access to have hi speed internet the entire time. One final general note: I was shocked at how LATE everybody in Paris tends to start their day. No kidding, I'm no early bird but if you get into the breakfast room at 8:30AM you'll basically have the place to yourself and can get a great spot to eat on the outside terrace. Our room was across from a business park and it was hilarious for me as an American to see the first person in the office arrive at 9:10AM. Nobody was working past 4:30PM. Unreal.

As a Diamond, was upgraded to a 7th floor exec room (lounge on 6th floor). At the recommendation of others on here, I also requested a terrace room but was initially denied, then told I could move to a terrace room the 2nd night in, so I was happy with that. Even though it was a courtyard view room, it did have a very nice view with the Eiffel Tower in the background. All staff with the exception of one lounge person treated us exceptional. Every hotel employee greeted us no matter where we were in the hotel when we passed - very hospitable. As far as the one lounge person - it definitely was an exception and the manager said she was very new and apologized for the incident we had. In a long nutshell - my wife entered the lounge about 5 minutes before closing after a night out at the monuments and was denied a Ginger Ale soft drink because they were getting ready to close. Meanwhile - people left and right were getting wine and alcohol, and even leaving the lounge with it. It seemed my wife for some reason was singled out - but to me that didn't matter - it was the ridiculousness of denying a Ginger Ale 5 minutes before close simply because the attendant said she couldn't drink it in time and can't take it back to the room. Yes - it was that crazy. I immediately went down to the manager who was very gracious, got the drink, and even gave my wife a chocolate Arc de Triomphe. He seemed to genuinely understand that this was not appropriate behavior and would be addressed - he also mentioned this person was very new. The only minor downside to the hotel were facilities issues. On our first morning, the cold water was shut off (yes, the COLD water!) for about 15 minutes. Since this was our first time using the shower, we thought we were doing something wrong. It never happened again after that. Our TV every 15-20 minutes would go blank for about 5 seconds and then return to programming - was told this was a common problem they couldn't do anything about. Had water pressure issues every now and then where the shower would just drip and nothing else, but usually that lasted about a minute or so. Also had probably about half a dozen elevator malfunctions - door would not close, door would close but elevator would not move and then doors would open and process would repeat, etc. So the facilities part was the big downside during our stay. Room cleaning and turndown occured at about the same time every single day, and always occured. Turndown service was very much appreciated, and always included a gift of chocolate. The chocolates were always different, but it was always chocolates. As far as the lounge itself - very large and usually could get a table. Pretty much had the same food every day at the same times - no variety or changing things up there. For breakfast - hot eggs, bacon, and sausage, and a variety of fruits and vegetables and assorted drinks. Lunch was hot soup and the assorted items. Dinner was puff pastries, soup, and the assorted items. Mid-day snacks included cookies and chocolates, and nuts. While they did run out of things every now and then, it usually only lasted a short time and were replenished rather quickly. A few times they had quite a many uncleaned tables (50% of the lounge) - but again, being that it wasn't a normal occurrence it could be overlooked. Overall was pleased with what the lounge offered compared to others. Lounge also had a nice balcony, but with only about 6 tables. Check in and out was extremely fast - no waiting - and concierge was always helpful - usually a 5 minute wait or so for them. To and from - we took a taxi as we were 4 people and that was the cheapest, and fastest way. Cost was 40 Euros from CDG - so split that was 10 each, and about a 20 minute ride. Were greeted by doormen who offered to take our luggage, and they were generally always there for all guests arriving, and always greeted you as you came in or left the hotel. Taxi's were always available if you wanted to take them, and the metro stop was a short 5 minute walk. Be careful with the metro! Don't get overcharged for a one day unlimited pass for 9-12 Euros which is the first option you come to for unlimited use - deep in the menu is unlimited daily use for 5 Euros in Paris, and it's very hard to find yourself without the assistance first of a metro official. Just ask them for the Paris unlimited day pass that costs around 5 Euros and they will (in our case) be more than happy to come out and show you how to get to it - it's about 6 menus deep! I think they put the more expensive daily passes easy to get to just to make more money on people. Even the hotel concierge told us a daily pass is 9 Euros - so something to think about. Internet - 22 Euros a day! Tried to work some magic at the front desk but was no go. Ended up getting a $59 monthly subscription to Boingo, which you could use to access the wired, and wireless, internet at the hotel. MUCH cheaper than having to pay 22 Euros a day ($31/day) if you need access. On top of that, Boingo also worked at the second hotel we stayed at (Versailles Trianon Palace - Hilton), and also at the airport going home, so overall a very good deal considering. If you need internet - would defiitely recommend a subscription service like that. Easily canceled the subscription upon leaving. They also have about 6-8 other subscription services they support (T-Mobile, AT&T, among some) at the hotel so you don't have to pay the enormous daily rate. Also - MANY THANKS to those that mentioned the breakfast restaurant coupons at the lounge desk. Lounge person also had no problem giving us coupon each night for the next morning so we could enjoy breakfast in the hotel restaurant rather than the lounge - all you had to do was ask nicely. We ended up eating breakfast in the lounge only once - but since it wasn't as good, we got coupons for every other day. The restaurant breakfast included all of the same lounge options, but had more hot items (hash browns, crepes, pancakes, etc), and more bread and some other minor options. Definitely worth getting compared to the lounge. Again - the most important part was that the lounge person never once minded giving you the coupons if you asked. Great to be in Paris on Bastille Day! Parade wasn't as good as it was hyped to be - but the fireworks were AMAZING. Even though we had to go and sit for 4 hours prior to the fireworks - it was worth it. I've never seen such a great display coming from both the Eiffel Tower and behind it - all with great musical accompaniment and seemed to go on forever and had several different themes and light shows going along with it. It was PACKED - but again, well worth it. If you ever get the chance to be there on Bastille Day - don't pass up the fireworks .. but to be on the Champ de Mars - you'll probably have to get there 4-5 hours early ... You can safely get there 1 hour early and probably have an OK partially obstructed view somewhere in the park ... but expect a ton of people! That's it ... All in all 4 stars out of 5 for me .. Very close to 3 stars due to facilities and the one lounge person in such a respected hotel - but the other staff and hospitality brought it back up to 4.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cA Great Experience\u201d", "Author": "ANDC77", "ReviewID": "UR34936745", "Content": "My wife and I stayed for three nights on points and had a great, great experience.

I figured since this hotel said \"Hilton Arc de Triomphe\" that it had to be close. I was pretty wrong. If you are walking to the hotel, it's easy to get turned around on a back street. The Arc is a good 10 or 15 minute walk from the hotel, which isn't horrible since we like to walk, but be sure to bring some good shoes when doing this. We arrived on a Sunday morning and were disappointed to find all restaurants in that area closed. Since it's in the business district, it strictly operates around those typical 9-5 or 6 hours. Luckily the hotel has a wonderful buffet breakfast (expensive though at 32 euros per person) that we took advantage of. I recommend snagging some food from the buffet for the walk around Paris during the day, as Supermarkets are not always nearby and when hunger pangs hit, it's hard to find something quick and easy. Our room was relatively big for European standards, and was very modern. I was impressed that the bathroom contained a large soaking tub and a decent sized shower. I was also excited that I could not hear foot traffic at night when we were going to sleep or waking up. These are not paper thin walls here. Overall, the hotel is very put together. The lobby is beautiful and clean. The staff were very helpful, although contrary to other reviews, I did not find the concierge to be one of my favorites. I didn't think he was that helpful and could not give me straight answers on certain questions.Unfortunately it was the same guy every day so I didn't have much exposure otherwise. We stayed here on hotel points and would stay again simply because we enjoyed walking around and discovering cafes that were a little more obscure/out of the way. I have to recommend a nearby Italian style restaurant right down the street by two blocks called Vinoteca. They are what I'd call midrange to expensive depending on the course - wonderful food and great wine. The atmosphere was so fun and romantic.

It is a 10--15 minute walk to the Champs Elysee and about a 25-30 minute walk to the Seine and Left Bank. At night, the streets leading to the hotel are very quiet and dark and at times we felt slightly unsafe because it was so deserted. The hotel is a 7 minute walk to the Line 9 metro stop (Saint Phillipe du Roule). The walk to this metro is up and down a steep hill, so if you have kids or are older, this may present an issue. There are many nice cafes, shops, a supermarket and a Starbucks (if you are in withdrawal as we were!) along the route to the metro and the Champs Elysee. Another issue that we had was that our room was not ready until 3:30pm. This was disappointing as check in time is at 2pm. There was no sense of urgency to get our room ready, which was just awful after a long flight.

I redeemed Hilton HHonors points for the stay. We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon, probably between 3 and 4 p.m. The check-in process was not overly friendly but very courteous and professional. We were given the keys to our room and told that someone would bring our bags up shortly. The porter arrived with our bags much more quickly than I expected, and he was followed by another gentleman who came bearing gifts. He brought a small chocolate dessert plate, which at first we tried to turn away because we didn't order it. He told us it was from the hotel, and when we thanked him, he said, \"Wait, there's more.\" He returned with a bottle of Mo\u00c3\u00abt & Chandon, and then he returned to the hall a few more times to bring us two champagne flutes, silverware and napkins, and a welcome note. We still don't know if the welcome gift is a standard amenity, or if it was a honeymoon gift (I did note that it was our honeymoon when making the reservation). Either way, it was a pleasant surprise and a nice way to begin our stay. The room was very nice. We had a king room which was spotless. I was very impressed with how clean everything was and how little wear and tear there was. For a European hotel room, it was a very comfortable size. I stayed in the Park Hyatt Place Vendome the last time I was in Paris, and I think that the Hilton's room was just as large if not larger, although the bathroom was smaller at the Hilton. I enjoyed the Crabtree & Evelyn La Source bath goodies like soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. I also appreciated the \"vanity kit\" which included cotton pads I used to remove my makeup at night. Every evening, we also received chocolates at turndown. One evening, we received rose-flavored hard candy, which were lovely and amazing! We did have a problem with our AC unit, which a technician came to work on. We were comfortable after that. The location of the Hilton Arc de Triomphe is very convenient. It's a short walk to the M\u00c3\u00a9tro station (Courcelles), and not far at all to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es. I also appreciated the quietness of the neighborhood. It's not a very happening place at night, but it's very quiet and it felt safe when we returned to the hotel and walked back from the M\u00c3\u00a9tro stop late at night. Our favorite part of our stay was the wonderful service we received from the concierges. They were always very friendly and helpful. Whether it was calling a cabaret to move our reservation to another evening or simply making a dinner suggestion and reservation, the staff really made a difference in the quality of our trip. One day, we were walking from the hotel and trying to find a shortcut to Ladur\u00c3\u00a9e, and one of the concierges -- who was in the area on his off day -- stopped and offered us perfect directions and said we would see him on his next day back at work. That was a really unexpected and much appreciated encounter that showed us that the staff actually cared about the guests...it wasn't just a job that they were clocking into and out of every day. We did not dine at the hotel, nor did we take advantage of any of the other services beyond the high-speed Internet access, which was very convenient but pricey. We loved the art deco style of the hotel, the courteous staff, and the convenient location.

I believe she was originally from Peru, but spoke French as well as English fluently. We ended up arriving quite early in the morning and as a result of this our room was not quite ready. They were kind to offer us their buffet breakfast. Although we just had a nice meal on the United Airlines flight we were pleased to accept the offer. Wow,...the buffet was impressive and from what I heard pretty expensive. Chocolate croissants, crepes, fruit platters and assorted meats is what we feasted on that morning. As we left we were happy to see that they had to go cups for coffee. The room took about 2 hours from the time of our initial check in to be available to us, but I didn't mind. The bell hop helped us with our bags and as he opened the door I was surprised that they had a bottle of champagne and fresh flowers waiting for us.

The service and the breakfast continued to be nice throughout our stay. The only thing I missed while there was a hot tub or pool to relax in. The hotel had a nice courtyard, but not too many places to sit and enjoy it. Keep in mind that when I say the Arc is near I mean it is about a 10 minute walk. Although I am Italian American and enjoy good Italian food I was sick of seeing it everywhere. I mean I went to France to eat, drink and see French. I was confident if I we walked up to the Champs Ellysee that we would be able to have a nice selection of French cuisine. We did ended up finding some french restaurants that charged about 100 euro per plate, but nothing more affordable. Recommendations that I would make are: -take the grand tour around the city with the tour buses that are available around town. This will give you good orientation and allow you to listen and learn a bit before you hit the road on foot. -Plan your restaurants and nightly activities in advance. This will save you from wondering around aimlessly trying to find a nice restaurant and will give you two something to look forward to each day. -Have a crepe, splurge on that tasty morsel at the local patisserie and use as much french as possible. I don't find the French to be so unhappy with those trying to learn and speak their beautiful language anymore. -Buy a baguette, some pate....YES some pate, some cheese and wine and sit in the grassy area underneath the Eiffel Tower and enjoy the day people watching and enjoying the view.

I decided to splash out on an executive room. After having told the hotel it was for a birthday, the hotel kindly ensured we had a lovely room with terrace on the 7th floor and champage and birthday cake waiting for us on arrival. The check-in experience was great, as we were offered a glass of wine whilst checking in. Our room was lovely, very spacious for a hotel room in Paris and the terrace was to die for. We had a great view of the Eiffel Tower. The staff all seemed very friendly. The service in the restaurant was a bit strange, as the waiter forgot to give us our bread when we sat down and therefore we didn't get our soup until our main course arrived, which wasn't too great. There were, however, a few little things that let the hotel down a bit. The air conditioning didn't work at all. We turned the temperature down to it's lowest point, and still the room didn't get any cooler. Also, we never had any tea/coffee mugs in our room at any time. So after calling for some mugs to be brought up, none ever arrived (which for an executive room, wasn't great). We had a late checkout booked and therefore after breakfast decided to use the spa (which is lovely). However, getting back to our room (about 12.30pm), we found our key cards didn't work. Not a surprise, as I stay in a lot of hotels beyond the normal checkout time and this happens frequently. However, when asking a maid to let us in (considering we were in our bath robes), she just shrugged and said no. It took a lot of persuading to get her to phone reception and send someone up. I advised, that this sort of thing shouldn't be happening to anyone, never mind someone staying in an Executive room. Overall, a fantastic hotel, spacious rooms, and a beautiful spa.

After getting to the suite my wife found it too far from elevator and once again we ask for another room. No problems if we would not mind waiting 30-60 mins. We went to the Executive Lounge, smoking and having a great time with quality drinks/food...very recommend.. Our room was ready in 45 mins and near elevator and on top 7th floor - full suite! My wife loved it and therefor I was happy... It is a very GOOD HOTEL in a very nice area... even my friends were recommending it without knowing that we already booked it. When you are polite, nice to people and if they have the availability the staff at HILTON will go the extra mile to make you happy!!!", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, IN", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Honeymoon at Hilton Arc de Triomphe Paris\u201d", "Author": "jrt0002", "ReviewID": "UR20819825", "Content": "First off, let me say that I was quite neurotic about researching the hotels for my honeymoon. I knew that I was going to spend a lot of money so I wanted to make sure that I found three great places. We began our trip by staying six nights at the Hilton Arc De Triomphe. Then, we took the train to Monte Carlo and stayed for three nights at the Vista Palace Hotel in Rocquebrune-Cap Martin, FR. Then, we finished up by staying three nights at The Palais Mediteranee in Nice, FR. The Hilton far exceeded my already high expectations. The hotel- absolutely beatuful. Incredible location. The park nearby is beautiful and you can ideed get free internet. The hotel is designed to look like a 1930's steamliner inside and they did a great job. The lobby is beautfiul and the restaurant was very nice. Some people complained that the location was somewhat remote, but that is why I loved it. You are right in the middle of the city, but it is not in the touristy/busy part. You are about two blocks from the Metro. If you are going to Paris, take the Metro EVERYWHERE! It is so cheap, easy, and safe. We figured out how to get everywhere without having to take a cab once. The staff- very cordial. I felt at times like I was in an American Embassy. The conceirge recommended Galopin one evening for dinner... this was by far our favorite meal of the trip! I am a Hilton Gold Member and was hoping for a room upgrade. Unfortunately, the upgrades were all taken so they gave me two free breakfast vouchers for everyday that I was there and two free glasses of champagne. The breakfast- Wow... just awesome. Sure, it was expensive, but man it was a great way to start the day. If you have the free passes this is definitely a highlight of this hotel. Otherwise, I think that it's 40 Euro/person for this buffet. They have a person who makes omelettes and crepes. The buffet has a huge array of choices that are both European and American. My favorite part was that you could take bottles of Evian back to your seat with you. The honeymoon treat- Absolutely wonderful! The first night they bring you a surprise which is delicious. The room- spacious, neat. Beautfiul bathroom. Pros- Everything Cons- Our floor had a somewhat odd smell, but it was really no big deal. The cost is high, so we used points... I would definitely pay the fee though, this is an incredible hotel. In conclusion... if you are considering this hotel, I HIGHLY advise you book here. This is just a great hotel, period.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat, but not for Honeymoon.\u201d", "Author": "SMorgado", "ReviewID": "UR20804133", "Content": "We had a good experience, but not a good place for our Honeymoon.

Some of the benefits to staying at this property are the larger room sizes (one can very comfortably fit a family of 4 into their \"Double Double\" room--an unusual feature in Paris where normally you can only get 2 people in a room), the proximity to the Metro (stop: Courcilles), the prices are generally less than other comparable properties, the neighborhood (8th arrondisement), and the staff (very friendly and helpful at all times, especially Olivier the concierge). Negatives include being slightly further out from the center of Paris--there is no direct Metro to the center of town so you must change trains, very expensive dining and bar, and the fact that is is an American chain so you are not really getting a \"real\" taste of Paris like you would in a smaller type hotel. Overall, most Americans will find this American chain a very good value and will be pleased with the space. Be warned, though, the rooms at the front of the hotel which face the street suffer from an incredible amount of street noise IF the window is open.

We arrived around 8 p.m. and no executive floor rooms were available. We asked for the management and after discovering that we were Diamond VIP, we were told an executive level room would be available the next day. I would be very clear when making your reservation that you are requesting the Exec. Club. If you are not on that floor you are denied priviliges. I think this is totally unfair, and have heard rumors that Hilton has changed this since we got home, but I would still check. The rooms are nice and tastefully decorated. The windows actually open. Ours overlooked the courtyard, and you could just barely see the top of the Eiffel Tower in the evening from the room. NOT the best for the scenic view, but the rest of our experience made up for it! I believe we were put in an \"emergency\" exec room, because the first one was nicer than the exec floor room. We were in a service hall area just behind the club. Other travelers described nicer rooms on this floor. My only real gripe would be that if you have long hair, the hair dryer keeps cutting off before your hair is dry. You have to wait about 10 minutes for it to cool down before you can start again. Very close walking distance to Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe. Very easy to catch the red bus tour. There is a nice market a few blocks away for reasonable cheeses, fresh fruits, and wines. There were not many nice cafes nearby, unless you walk up to Champs Elysees. The immediate area appears to be a bit of a business district. The Executive Club was NOT skimpy with the \"frou-frous\". Very nice location on the rooftop, and smoking is allowed outside. Again, not much of a view, as it overlooks several groups of apartments, but the option to enjoy sunshine and fresh air made up for that. It was a nice place for my fiance to sit and work, as wireless was available there. This club is open from early in the morning until around 11 p.m. They served a nice hot breakfast with eggs, meats, cheeses, fruits, and several breads and pastries. There was ALWAYS something available, all day long. Lunch time they brought out a nice selection of sandwich and snack items, and cocktail hour had shrimps, chicken and various hot items throughout our stay. A full bar and unlimited wine and champagne was available all day. This includes mornings, in case you want a mimosa with breakfast. We enjoyed chatting with other travelers from around the world, and had a big party table going each evening. Fun FUN! The entire property is very clean and stylish. We were greeted with a friendly smile everywhere we went. Special requests were attended to promptly and cordially. Concierge was happy to mail our postcards as we were leaving.

After receiving the credit card statement, we were surprised to find out that they have not only charged the credit card with the prepaid rate of 275 Euro, but also with an additional 1,600 Euro. To make a long story short, it took us more than a week to get Hilton to transfer the money back ! We have never received a word of apology !!! Upon arriving there, staff were friendly as hell. It took ages to check in and my wife had to participate in an urgent conference call. When answering the guy at the reception if there is a quite area in the hotel to take this call, he replied \"No.\". So he got us the keys to the room, my wife rushed upstairs and I have spoken to the Guest Relation Manager about the credit card charge. Finally someone apologiesed and promised us to send some champagne for the inconvience (unfortunately, it has never arrived). In the meantime, I got a phone call from my wife that the keys don't work. So she ran back downstairs and the receptionist thought he might have to give us a lessen in how to use the keys first before putting the code back on. Of course, he forgot it in the first time. While my wife was doing the phone call, I thought about buying some water in a supermarket. So I asked the porter outside the hotel and he simply returned: \"I don't give directions\". So I had to go back inside ask someone at the reception for a supermarket and was told, that they don't know whether there is a supermarket around the area. So I went back outside and it was pouring. So I thought I could take a Hilton umbrella. The porter refused to give me one. Coming to the room. It was very small, the sheets and the towels smelled as if someone has smoked with it (although it was a non-smoking room). The room was facing an office building and you were able to see the screens of the guys working there, which gives you really a nice feeling of privacy for your room. In addition, a church is somewhere close to the hotel and the church bell rings every hour. Furthermore, the air condition was making some burbing sound during our entire stay. The bathroom is as tiny as the room and you can see some stains and mould here and there. The shower is really uncomfortable.

Overall, it's a relatively nice hotel and I can understand to a certain degree some of the enthusiasm here. But, as a frequent traveler and a guest of several hotels in the Paris area alone, I just don't feel that this hotel property merits the accolades people are writing here and certainly not in proportion to the prices that they charge. I ran into several problems in my short stay: 1) The biggest problem that I ran into was that the Air Conditioning unit in my room (located in the ceiling near the door) began to vibrate randomly around 2:30 in the morning. To get an idea of how this sounded, imagine a cell phone hidden in the ceiling that would vibrate loudly and randomly every couple of minutes (sometimes multiple times in a minute). I of course tried turning off the AC unit and wearing ear plugs, but the unit would still vibrate (and I could still here the vibrating with ear plugs), so I called the Front Desk (I speak French fluently) to tell them the problem. At first they wanted to send a technician to the room to start working on the unit in the ceiling. I said that this would be fine if I could move to another room (I needed to wake up early), but of course, the hotel was full. So, they said that they would have a technician try to shut off power to the unit from the central station. I was fine with this, but it ended up taking nearly 45 minutes to have the unit's power terminated. So, after being awoken by the faulty unit, I wasn't able to go back to sleep for at least an hour. I understand that technical problems happen and will give them credit for finding a way to stop the problem in a relatively timely manner. However, for any hotel that is charging prices at this level, there needs to be some sort of compensation to the customer in return for any inconvenience like this. This is where they fell short, simply saying that they couldn't offer reduced rates, breakfast at no charge, etc. They simply weren't willing to correct this wrong and so this is the biggest reason that I cannot recommend this hotel to any other potential guests. 1) The mattress is way too firm - one of the firmest that I have come across in a hotel. I tend to like mattresses on the firmer side, but this really was extreme. My back and neck were slightly sore the next morning. 2) There is a raised tile-covered ridge between the sink room and the toilet room in the bathroom that is unexpected and difficult to see in the dark. I slammed one of my toes on this pretty hard during the night. 4) The hallways had a slightly fishy odor. It wasn't strong by any means, but it still smelled a bit off when walking to my room. 5) This is more of a caveat and has been mentioned on here, but the hotel isn't located right by the Arc de Triomphe or Champs Elysees. Instead, it is a 10-15 minute walk away. With all the hotels that are available in Paris, I feel that there are other, better options in terms of comfort, price and service. In particular, the service element is what is lacking at this hotel. The staff weren't mean, snotty or anything of that nature. They just didn't seem to care and definitely didn't understand that in response to a problem that interrupts and prevents the client from sleeping, they need to find a way to compensate for this. Instead they acted indifferent about the issue and so I've chosen to come here and offer this as a potential warning to other travelers.

I checked into the hotel and initially I was offered only a standard room! French language difficulties were of no concern as almost all staff speak English fluently even if you try to converse in French.

I insisted that I be offered a room on the Executive level, and I was accommodated, but I felt that I should not have had to ask for what had already been reserved. Upon arriving at my room the air conditioner did not work. Once again I felt that this should have been checked out ahead of my arrival.

The Executive/Hilton Honors floor rooms are nicely decorated and quite comfortable, but the beds do have a single sheet, but a duvet instead.

It is possible to actually eat a full breakfast, lunch and dinner in the Executive Lounge if you choose. Praise: 1. Definitely a better hotel that what is available elsewhere in Paris. For the price you pay you are left comparing actual value perceived versus high expense. 2. The staff in the Purple Bar is outstanding and fluent in English. Criticisms: 1. TIP: Housekeeping staff tend NOT to knock, but walk right in, unless your door is locked or you have the DO NOT DISTURB sign up. 2. The staff in the Executive Lounge demonstrate a bit of an arrogant attitude, and this just shouldn't be the case, especially since most of those hotel guests are Hilton Honors members. A. I found one Executive Lounge waiter joking about another guest which is entirely unprofessional. B. Another Executive Lounge waiter handed me a fork by fork end and not the handle. He looked upset when I asked him for a different fork. Then I informed him that I am a sommelier by profession, and he should have known better. 3. The hotel staff service is definitely better than most other hotels, but it certainly is not the best I experienced on my two week trip to France. Had I not booked this stay using my Hilton Honors points, I would have been very disappointed if I would have had to pay for hotel stay as it was not exceptional by any means.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highland, CA", "Title": "\u201cModern Marvel\u201d", "Author": "klindsied", "ReviewID": "UR17979244", "Content": "This hotel is a gem--being in Paris, it is safe to say that staying in an american hotel is your best bet because the french can be condescending to Anericans.

This trip was part of a 15 night trip to Europe. The booking at this location was on a Hilton HHonors reward stay. We booked a King non-smoking room, and due to my HHonors Diamond status, were upgraded to a lovely King non-smoking suite on the fourth floor. (Upgrade was not available till the second day, but the first room was also very nicely sized King room, but had no lounge access or we would have stayed put there.) We arrived in Paris via high speed train from Amsterdam, and the taxi ride to the hotel was quick and easy (approximately 22 Euro). We did not want to take the Metro (and the associated stairs) with our luggage. The hotel has a beautiful lobby, restaurant, and bar. Check in was quick and easy. Quela the guest manager was phenomenal with accommodating us to the upgrade on our second and subsequent nights and really sought to make our stay wonderful. As part of my HHonors Diamond status we were given complimentary breakfast and drink coupons for the first night as the Executive level was sold out. Once we moved to the suite, we had Executive lounge access which was very critical to our wonderful stay. The first morning we went down and had the breakfast was wonderful, but if I was actually paying for it, the price would be excessive. (I think it was 30 Euros per person). The second morning we went to the executive lounge to have breakfast but it was packed with very limited seating availability. We asked the attendant for vouchers to go to the restaurant which they gladly provided, (which they also provided for the remainder of our stay on request.) The Executive Lounge has snacks all day, tea time with takes from 3-6pm, heavy appetizers and an entr\u00c3\u00a9e, from 6-9, and desserts till closing at 11pm. The evening offerings made meals for us most nights as the main entr\u00c3\u00a9e was varied and always had meat or fish. Additionally, the lounge has water, sodas, wine, beer, and cocktails. A nice touch in the lounge would be complimentary internet access. The hotel is approximately 10 minute walk to Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es where dining options are available into the wee hours of the night, as well as lots of shopping). The River and Eiffel Tower are about a 30 minute walk if you choose to walk. The Metro needs 1-2 trains to get to many points but is very efficient and less than a five minute walk from the hotel. A taxi runs about 6 Euro to most of the tourist areas beyond a 15 minute walking distance if you choose not to take the metro. There are two convenient metro stops within a 5-7 minute walk. Other than Champs-Elys\u00c3\u00a9es this is rather an upscale residential area. (There is a Laundromat about 5 minutes away - great for those long trips where you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay 5 Euros to wash a shirt!) The location of the Hilton Paris (rather than Arc de Triomphe) could be a bit more centrally located, but the top notch service and great rooms (even the standard rooms) make this the best option. Both rooms were large, especially for Europe, with rooms overlooking a central atrium shared with an office complex. As with most European hotels, the beds were hard, but just fine. The bathroom had both a shower and separate tub. There was a lot of custom mosaic tile work. The bathrooms have frosted glass doors, which can be annoying if one person gets up to use the bathroom and needs to turn on the lights, it lights up the whole bedroom area. Housekeeping did an excellent job with keeping the room clean and well stocked with toiletries. They had bathrobes and slippers in the room for the guests to use. The hotel also had a nice cake, roses, and wine as this was an anniversary trip for us. Some nights they provided turn down service, other nights they did not, but there was no rhyme or reason to that. The room was spotlessly clean. They have a private access gym that is available to all guests. The \"wet\" areas (Sauna, hot tub, etc) are for a charge, but if you are a Diamond member they waive that fee. The spa is full service and we did use the hot tub. We never actually went down to the gym as we were doing enough walking to stay fit; however, we did use the hot tub one evening just before closing. (The gym and wet areas close rather early so we were rarely back before closing.) The concierge staff and bell staff was EXCELLENT and always went above and beyond in providing us with excellent service, advice, and assistance when needed. On arrival the bell services were rather slow so we went down and got our bags from the lobby but their service was otherwise great. All of the staff was multi lingual, I frequently heard French, English, Spanish, and German from the staff. The only suggestions I would have for this hotel is to get rid of the frosted glass windows on the bathroom door. It looks beautiful but can be annoying if someone gets up to use the bathroom in the night. Also, the air conditioning did not keep the room quite cool enough.

A full breakfast is provided each day with a wide variety of food including an excellent machine that makes all forms of coffee ranging from espresso to cappucino's.

The end result was a rebooking for 6 free nights as a GLONP2 (be sure to ask for this), which gave me the sixth night for \"free\" - which saved me about 75,000 points. At check-in, the hotel immediately recognized my Diamond status and upgraded us to a King Deluxe Plus Executive non-smoking room with access to the Executive lounge on the 6th floor. They also gave us coupons for free champagne in the hotel restaurant, and complimentary use of the \"refreshing pool\" in the hotel spa, Mosaic. I should note that check-in was available despite an early arrival around 10:30 a.m. From front desk staff, to bell staff, to the concierge and the waiters - everyone seemed delighted with our attempts to speak French, but ready to switch to English at any time to make things easier on us. We were strictly on vacation, though most folks staying at this hotel were on business.

We started every day there with breakfast and \"refreshed\" in the evenings with a complimentary glass of champagne or wine (a full complimentary self-serve bar is available). The room was nice, and the description of the King Deluxe Plus on the website is very accurate, so I won't go into detail here.

The first night we ate at Le Safran, the hotel's restaurant. The staff are very friendly and the menu featured French and international cuisine. There were several little surprises (a duck foie gras mousse with pomegranate seeds for an amuse') along the way that made this a nice experience. The complimentary champagne turned out to be one of the nicest selections on the wine list - about 20 euros a glass. We also made a couple of late night stops into the Purple Bar - a fun Art Deco lounge) for nightcaps while we were there. The Concierge staff are terrific. Marie-Leisse helped in advance via e-mail to arrange dinners for four nights at some very trendy places that had been suggested to us. The location of the hotel is walking distance to many top spots, including the 3-starred Guy Savoy. Alain and Olivier were also great in helping us to know what was open and what was closed, since our stay spanned the May 8 \"Victory Day\" national holiday, as well as stamping and mailing our regular postcard dispatches. All in all, this is one of the nicest Hilton properties I have ever stayed at - we really felt as if the all the staff were going the extra mile to make our vacation as pleasant and as memorable as possible. The residential neighborhood location was a great alternative to the more familiar Eiffel Tower/tourist zone location of the older Paris Hilton. Local info: Corcelles Metro (#2/Blue Line) is about 2 blocks from the hotel, providing easy access. There was almost always a line of taxis available in front of the hotel. Not to miss: about 2 blocks from the hotel, is the beautiful Second Empire-era Parc Monceau. Several Belle Epoque \"follies\" adorn the park, which is ringed with incredible mansions and a couple of small museums. There is free wi-fi in the park, as well. This is nice, since the hotel charges a steep 22 Euro charge for internet per day. You can pick up the signal from the park from the terrace of the 6th floor executive lounge - this was nice for checking e-mail and sending \"e-postcards\" to friends and family each day. To be avoided: the Corcelles Grill at the nearby Corcelles Metro stop (the most convenient stop near the hotel). It was the only neighborhood bistro open on the holiday, and we thought we would get a quick lunch there prior to afternoon sightseeing. While the host and hostess were quite gracious, the waiter was clearly not happy about working on the holiday, and treated us to a dreadfully surly experience, from our first \"Bonjour, Monsieur\" to the \"l'addition sil vous plais.\" He spoke two words to us (in English) the entire meal: \"cheese? dessert?\" - our reply was a polite, \"non, merci.\"", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "McSorley23", "ReviewID": "UR15407960", "Content": "The beds were very hard, but you will find that in most of Europe.

No matter how well (or not) you can sleep on the plane. But from the moment we got there I was just blown away by how accommodating they were. For one they let us check in at 9:30 AM. They also provided us complimentary drinks and passes to the Louve. But it wasn't just what they did but how they did it. They were just so friendly and helpful with everything. If I didn't know better I'd swear we were at Disney World instead of a hotel in the center of a major city. The manager greets you while your being checked in, introduces himself and requests you contact him if we need anything. The conciere's desk went out of their way to highlight areas of interest. And I'm not talking about the the tower and the arc. They advised us what parts of the town we would enjoy, where we could find historic churches, what days each of the attractions were open etc. Room wise, it was very clean and well kept.

The transit strike was in full swing for the duration of our trip but we were still able to get around the city (but not to Versailles, unfortunately) because of our proximity to Metro line 2 which ran a few times every hour.

My wife and I just got back from the second leg of our honeymoon in Paris. Our first leg was in Florence, and you can read my review of the Hotel Porta Faenza there. I'll start by saying that I used Hilton HHonors points for a free 6-night stay at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe. I am HHonors Gold and was upgraded to an executive room on arrival. The room was large for european rooms and was very comfortable. The bed was fantastic. The bathroom had a tub and shower stall, and marble floors. The Hilton provided 2 bottles of water daily, slippers, and bathrobes. Upon arrival, there was a box of chocolates waiting for us in the room. One word of caution - if you get them, eat them. We left half the box on the table and it was removed by housekeeping when they cleaned. I didn't bother complaining about this (though we would have liked more). Anyway, the second night when we arrived back, we found a second welcome gift awaiting us. The hotel had a plate of desserts/snacks and a half-bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us. The best part of this hotel was the executive lounge. You need to have a room on the executive floor, or an exec room to get access. The lounge is open from 7:30am - 11pm, and serves food and drink all day long (all for free). There is an ample breakfast served from 7:30-10:30am. There is a coffee machine that brews cafe, espresso, cappucino all-day long. The coffee was great (even though it was machine-brewed). The lounge served free snacks all day long, including cheeses, some sort of beef stew, cookies, candy. There was free wine, champagne, liquor, bottled water, coke, etc. all day. One night we were too stuffed to go out and eat dinner. We ended several evenings with a few glasses of wine and chocolates in the lounge. The hotel is also in a good area. A very nice residential neighborhood. Not too far of a walk from the Arc or the Champes Ellysees. I debated between this hotel and the Hilton Paris by the Eiffel. We walked by the other and agreed this one is in a much nicer area in the city. We walked to the Eiffel twice...Not too far, but not too close. Unfortunately, the transit workers were on strike and so metro service was sporadic or packed while we were there.

I think it explains everything. However if you don't have these problems the hotel is beautiful and well located. \"I would like to bring to your attention my highly unsatisfactory stay at your hotel earlier this week. Checking into the Hilton Arc de Triomphe on July XXX at around 12h15 in the afternoon I was promptly checked-in to room XXX. Spending only a few minutes in the room to drop off my luggage I found the room satisfactory and left at once for my office located down the street on Rue Monceau. Arriving back at the hotel around 20h00 in the evening to quickly change for a business dinner I noticed an odd smell in the hotel room. Approaching the window I realized that the entire carpet and wall below the window sill were soaked with water carrying the distinct grey hue of mold. Obviously there had a been a problem for quite sometime. Having little time before my next engagement I stopped by the reception on way out to inform them of the problem. The staff were perfectly pleasant apologizing for the inconvenience and promising to send someone up to see what could be done to fix the problem and, if no problem could be found, to change my hotel room. Had this occurred I would not be writing to you at this time as I would have been perfectly satisfied with how the situation was handled. Hotels make mistakes and should surely be given the chance to rectify them. Unfortunately when returning to my room at 23h15 in the evening I found that not only had nothing been done but that the stench by this time was intolerable. It would have been impossible to sleep in this room. Calling the reception not one person on duty was aware of my earlier complaint. However after verifying the room number they were not surprised by the problem as I was informed that my room was 'closed' and was not to be assigned due to the leak. At this point they promised to send some up to look at the situation immediately. After waiting, in the hall (because of the odor), for 25 minutes, I was forced to call the reception a second time. It was only then that they sent someone to help me transfer to a comparable room on the same floor. The whole ordeal of transferring rooms meant that instead of going to bed at 23h15 I was not able to get to bed until well after midnight. Having woken up at 4h30 in the morning to catch a red eye flight to Paris and working for twelve hours straight this was certainly a less than ideal way to end my evening. The next morning when checking out no mention to the prior evening's events were made until I brought up the issue. At this point I was clumsily offered a discount on the my room. In all honesty this represents little compensation for me, spending over 100 days a year in hotel rooms neither me nor my employer could care less about saving a few euros on a hotel room. Spending over a third of my time in hotels for work I value a customer service and more importantly a good night's sleep. This is much more important to me than the actual cost of a hotel room and I would venture to say that this is the case for many of the business travelers you wish to attract.''", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "VonMannheim", "ReviewID": "UR8190420", "Content": "As mentioned in other reviews; it is the staff that makes staying here so memorable.

Our stay was strictly for fun \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2nd trip to Paris; my 3rd. We picked this hotel because of the good Trip Advisor ratings and the fact we generally prefer American style hotel rooms when traveling in Europe. Overall, we thought this was a good hotel that could have been great if it had any wow factor whatsoever. Rooms: As I am a Hilton Honors member with Diamond status, we were upgraded to an Executive Room facing Rue de Courcelles (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one but if you have the opportunity, ask for one of the of the ones with a balcony and table/chairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those look like fun on a pretty night!). Furnishings in the room were as advertised \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Art Deco. The room was standard Hilton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pretty nice based on European hotel room standards; average for a typical full service American hotel. Things we liked: wash cloths, complimentary slippers, complimentary USA Today each day, high powered A/C, and very plush king bed. Things we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like: the in-room hair dryer was a joke. The cord that attached it to the wall was no more than 12 inches. It was virtually useless given the location where it was mounted (approx. 12 inches from the edge of the sink). Secondly, no one goes to Paris to watch TV however the size of the 19\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flat screen TV was a little disappointing for the size of the room and caliber of the hotel. Other: Turn down service was provided all 3 nights. Both the room and the bathroom were EXCEPTIONALLY clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c kudos to housekeeping. Executive Lounge: On a whole \u00e2\u20ac\u201c disappointing. The staff was very friendly, the lounge itself was comfy (enjoyed the balcony), and the bus staff was impeccable (empty plates and glasses were removed promptly). However, the snack selection catered a little too much to Americans in my opinion (i.e. chips & salsa everyday, chicken wings one day, and then freezer-section chicken nuggets the next). Secondly, too much of the clientele confused the lounge for a restaurant. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just classless when the lounge is packed and you load your plate up with 15+ chicken wings! The lounge isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a Las Vegas buffett. On the upside, we liked the department store macaroons that showed up one afternoon (check out the price on these babies the next time your in Galeries Lafayette \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll appreciate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem even more!) Transportation: The Courcelles metro stop (line 2) is a 5 minute walk (roughly 3/10 of a mile) from the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2 stops from the Charles DeGaulle/Etoile stop (access to the RER and a handful of other metro lines) and about 5-6 from the Montmarte/Sacre Coeur area. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on metros all over Europe and the States and there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a single one that I find as efficient and useful as this one. My wife and I probably took 15-18 trips over 3 days (buy the 10 ticket carnet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lowers your cost to roughly 1.10 Euros per ticket) to just about every site Paris has to offer. To get to/from the airport, take line 2 to Charles DeGaulle, transfer to RER A towards Disneyland, then transfer at Chatelet to RER B towards CDG or Orly (depending on what you need). Trips to the airport are 8 Euros per person (more because you cross all 5 zones). General Area: Other reviews are pretty accurate. The Rue de Courcelles is basically a colorless Parisian street made up of business and residences. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any charming cafes or trendy shops that most people associate with Paris and frankly, this place isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that close to the Arc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 10-15 minute walk up Ave Hoche to get there. You basically have to hop on the metro and go somewhere anytime you want to shop/eat/see something. Knocks: 2. Realistically, this hotel caters to the business crowd. Prices are high (geared to people with expense reports) and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a virtual fortress of meeting rooms. Secondly, the hotel won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win any awards for its proximity to the main sights. As noted above, you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk anywhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even the Arc is 10-15 minutes. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagine the Louvre and other central sites could take anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes. Hilton vs. Hilton: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at both Hiltons in Paris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Arc and the Eiffel Tower. Personally, we prefer the Eiffel Tower location. It may not be quite as new but we found the rooms to be of comparable quality and the views (wow factor) of the Tower and Right Bank are unbeatable. The Eiffel Tower may also have slightly better transporation options as it has access to both a metro and RER stop within a 5 minute walk. Overall, this is a very nice hotel. We enjoyed our stay. The rooms are nice and the service is acceptable (i.e. no one really goes out of their way to do anything for you). Unfortunately I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t classify this place as exceptional (what you expect for the prices they charge). We would return, but only if we got a pretty good deal (i.e. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay 275 euros a night) Furthermore, if you are considering using your points (40k per night), I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend using them elsewhere (i.e. Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Mar).", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "Alexcat", "ReviewID": "UR8081981", "Content": "My husband & I stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for 4 nights in July.

The ride takes about 1/2 hour. There is a cafe (Le Cristal) located one block from the bus-stop (corner of rue de Tilsitt and ave Grande Armee) that has the best coffee and Croque Madame that I have found in Paris.

The staff were extremely nice and knowledgeable. Evelyne, a front desk clerk, possesses an outstanding knowledge of the city. I was provided with a Deluxe King room which was, by Paris standards, huge. Although coffee/tea facilities were not provided, the room was otherwise perfect: comfortable bed, quality furnishings, bathrobes and slippers. The view from the window was nothing spectacular, but not shabby either (A view of an upscale street in Paris is pretty nice). When the drain in my bathtub did not work, a technician was sent up to fix it immediately, at 11:30 pm.

They did compensate me with free breakfast coupons for their breakfast buffet. That turns out to be quite a deal as they charge 30 Euros for breakfast! I don't know who pays that kind of money for breakfast, but it was always packed. The rooms are small, as expected in Europe, but very neat and mostly clean. There was some normal wear and tear, but in the bathroom there was a good bit of mold in the shower and ceiling. Otherwise, the bathroom was nice with a seperate tub and shower. The only other complaint I had is the airconditioning was turned off. I still find it hard to believe that a hotel like this would still decide when their customers would like airconditioning. It was still a bit cool in May, but being in a small room with stagnant air can become very uncomfortable and warm. Opening a window was just ok, but the noise level outside made it impractical for me. The hotel is very popular with business people and upscale travelers, so I didn't exactly fit in around there. The patrons seemed to have a bit of snob appeal but the staff were very pleasant. The location is a bit out of the way except for the Arc de Triomphe.

We walked up to the reception, and when my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 brought out the Diamond VIP card, as the reservation was on this card, we were simply given a key card and asked to use the elevator up to the 6th floor. On the 6th floor we were greeted by an extremely serviceminded personell, and taken into an office where they processed our reservation. Unfortunately, the room was not ready (it was about 2 pm) - but I think this is because the reservation was originally for a standard room, but they upgraded us because of the Diamond VIP (funny thing the computersystem hadn't registered that, but oh well). We were given the option of going for a walk, and they would call us when the room was ready, or we could simply hang out in the lounge - which we ended up doing. We watched sports on the giant flat screen, had snacks and drinks - all for free.

My son's reaction: \"This room is very small.\" Sadly, he was right. Our room, although on the executive floor, was tiny. Just barely enough room to walk between the beds and the dresser.

Around 3 pm (afternoon tea time) they put out finger sandwiches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c smoked salmon, chicken, and cucumber usually. The dinner snack was more sandwiches and a hot item (it differed on the night, but there were chicken wings, fried pasta, small ribs, etc), plus the nuts and chips. (After a long day of touring, we usually came back and made a meal of the stuff). Later in the evening, they put out chocolates that were quite excellent.

It is in a very safe and quiet financial/diplomatic district. It is not at the Seine or the Eiffel Tower, but a brief cab ride will get you there quickly, or better yet enjoy a pleasant and romantic walk. Do take the Air France bus from Charles DeGaulle to the Arc de Triomphe, and walk a few blocks to the hotel.

Do ask the concierge/staff for help and suggestions - buy your Louvre and other museum tickets here to avoid lines - we took their advice and explored the newly opened Musee de l'Orangerie of Impressionist art, and went to a nearby bistro as recommended.

We are in in our early 30's and were celebrating our anniversary, my birthday and valentines all in one! We had not had a chance to get away by ourselves since the birth of our two children 3 years ago, so this was very special, being just the two of us. We used our Hilton points and hold the silver VIP membership. We checked in late around 8pm and orginally given a room on the 5th floor. The room was nice with the sink on the outside of the bathroom and a big king size bed. I had asked before I left the US what the availabilty was at the hotel and they has said full for the time I was staying there. I thought since it was a special trip I would go back down and see what I could do to get an upgrade. I just asked and explained by situation and viola! They upgraded us to the 7th floor, balcony room with the executive lounge priviledges! We moved all of our things to the new room and unpacked and checked out the fabulous view of the Eiffel tower from our balcony! We were in the last room on the 7th floor, however, I discovered that the shower head was broken. I called downstairs and after a promise to send someone up in a few minutes to fix it, we went to the executive lounge to check that out. After a couple of drinks, we went back to our room to find that the shower head was not fixed as of yet. Again I called downstairs and they informed me that the part has been ordered for quite sometime and still has not come in. They don't know when it will come in, probably at some point during our stay, but not in the next day or so. So again we were moved to another room, this time closer to the elevators. The room was exactally the same, except the further room had a much bigger safe. So again we packed and unpacked and moved. Finally we showered and changed and played under the sheets and then we went to bed by 2am! After all it was our first night in the city of love! How could we not?? The room was bigger than the one on the 5th floor and had a flat screen tv. Which did stop working one night, but was fixed the next morning. There are only 2 channels you get in English and alot in French and Arabic. I think we saw about 15 minutes of tv if that during our whole stay. There are games you can play on the tv as well, which my husband discovered one night and had a blast playing them while I had a nice long soak in the tub. The bathroom had the sink and standing shower along with a large bathtub all in one room, not separate like the one on the 5th floor. Maid service was good, though they did not speak any English. We had turn down service each night with two liitle boxes of chocolates on the pillows! Yummy! The shampoo and shower gel, is not too good, so you may want to bring your own. They do give you a wash clothes, shower cap, embry board, q-tips, shoe shine, and of course soap. You also get two large and fluffy bathrobes and slippers! The bed was comfortable with goose down comforter and 3 large fluffy pillows. The weather was in the low 70's and over-cast to sunny all of our days there and one if it were any hotter, I don't think the a/c would of been sufficent. I don't know if there was something wrong with our a/c but we had it on the whole time we were there and it barley felt cool. The weather was perfect and it only rained one day for 15 minutes while we were standing in line to the Saint Chappell. Of course the only day we left our umbrellas in our hotel room as well! Figures right? The hotel is very nice in the Art Deco theme and very clean. The closest metro Courcelles is 1 3-5 minute walk. You will need to change to any place you go, not a big deal unless you are under time restrains. The metro by the Arc de Triomphe Charles de Gaulle Etoile is more central and that one is a good 15 minute walk. We took the Air France bus from the airport (pay on the bus, via euros). You can save 16E by buying a roundtrip ticket. It took about 45 minutes to get to our stop by the Arc and then we had only two roll-on bags and a back pack so we walked to the hotel. Not to hard to find at all. Be sure to have a map with you at this time. It comes in handy to find the hotel. If you take the taxi it will cost a min. of 6E, plus if you have bags, not worth it. The bus begins the trips to the airport at 5:45am bythe Arc and runs every 15 minutes or so. We took it back to the airport as well. Very easy and cost effective. We found the staff at the hotel to be just okay. Not really going out of their way, but doing their jobs. We had no problems aside from the broken shower head and the tv. The concerige were always willing to help and most helpful. There are taxis at all times outside of the hotel so that's never a problem either. We did not eat at the hotel restraunts, but did look at the menus and they were very pricey! The bar was pretty busy a couple of nights. There were lots of business as well as leisure travelers the time we were there. But the hotel never felt crowed. There is a very high fee to use the internet at the hotel. We saw many internet cafes that were a lot cheaper around the city. There are two phone booths right outside the hotel which we used nightly to call home to check on the kids. Very handy as it is insainly expensive to use the hotel room phones! We were gone all day everyday from early in the morning to late at night except our last two days there. On those two days, we went to the Executive lounge in the early evenings and found it to be quite full. They did have the same food out for breakfast each day, but plenty of food to get you started. Dinnertime they did have different food the two nights we were there and for late night snacks, they had different things almost each night. Of course there was not a lot of choices, but a few finger sandwiches and the such. Not too bad. One night they had really good food and alot of it and I could of made that my dinner, had I not just eaten two hours before! They always had coke, orange juice, beer, water, champagne, wine, gin, vodka, rum and brandy availabe each day. Apples and bananas each day along with a nice fruit salad each morning. If you can get an upgrade, by all means do try! I heard if you can't get the upgrade, try to get the free breakfast, they usually give you that which is around 20E or so. The street across the metro station Courcelles, has many little shops and places to eat. We found a couple of fun places, Indiana a tex-mex restraunt that was always busy in the evenings and good food at good prices on Hoche street, about a 8 minute walk going towards the Arc. One of the best Cholcalatiers in also nearby, called La Maison du Chocolat on 225 rue du Faubourg St Honore, again only a 8 minute walk away. Nicholas is a grocery store and good deals on wines and beers which is across the street from the Courcelles metro stop. There is no shuttle that goes between this hotel and the Eiffel tower as some have indicated. Perhaps they only run it in the summer? I asked several employees there and none knew anything about this. Since we used the executive lounge for breakfast, after dinner snacks, we really saved a lot of money. We usually ate on the run, simply because of all the sites we wanted to take in, so we did not go to many of the recommended restraunts, but there are tons of places to eat so that shouldn't be a problem. Another benefit being the on 7th floor is that you get to use the spa whirlpool for free, otherwise there is a 25E charge. There is a sauna and a steam room. We only found time to use it on our very last day there, but enjoyed it emmensely as we were the only two in there! The water however in the jaccuzzi was barley warm, but we didn't let that stop us from having fun! You do not need to know much French at all to enjoy the city. I knew probably 30 phrases and I barely got to use them...85% people speak enough to answer your questions no matter where you are. Even those who do not speak any English, we found we could communicate with them without much effort as well. The metro are very easy to use, realiable, fast and cost effective. By the un carnate (10 tickets) or carte orange if you will be using the metro 3-4 times a day. We had a wonderful and romantic time while we were in Paris! If and when we go back someday I don't think I would stay here again, only becasue of the location. Yes, it is quite, but too much walking to get to the center of the city and all the major sites. We did enjoy our time at the hotel in our larger upgraded room and the executive lounge privileges made our stay just that much better!", "Date": "May 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA Really Top Class Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Yochi", "ReviewID": "UR5226831", "Content": "We had the most fabulous time in Paris staying at this hotel.

The Lounge provided us with a place to relax in the evening drinking complimentray champagne, and snacking on chips, pralines, nuts, olives, fruit, and hot snacks. I believe they had sandwiches and hot snacks throughout the day but we were exploring Paris and missed most of those! The Lounge is a nice place to meet and talk to others. We ate breakfast there the first morning, great service and nice food, but we thought the selection was smaller than the previous Hilton we stayed in. Still, cereals, pastries, coffee tea, hot items, fruits meats, cheeses and rolls, etc etc etc. The second morning we asked to eat downstairs in the main hotel restaurant, where the food selection is SO much better!! Try the lounge and the restaurant if you can. The staff happily stored our luggage on the last day, and again, they were all so polite and courteous.

Hilton Arc de Triomphe is a splendid hotel and the atmosphere is outstanding. Paris is even better in the fall, than in the summer. We took a lazy stroll down a calm Champes Elysee, and walked down all the way, to the Louvre. We got there at 7 o'clock at night and wandered the place almost alone. Extraodinaire feeling, almost out of this world. It was us and the great artists, a friendly and completely stress-less experience. We were alone with Mona Lisa and couldn't help thinking about the Da Vinci Code... Afterwards, we took a taxi to a restaurant called Spice. A nice and cozy restaurant with a 100% Paris-feel to it. Quite cheap and very romantic. Enough about that and more about the hotel. We actually got a cheaper rate from their own website, so check it out. The hotel itself is more expensive than most hotels, but it's SO WORTH IT! The decor is suductive and very romantic, and the service is excellent. The lobby is like I would imagine Titanic's decor was. This is a hotel experience to remember, and we loved it. Breakfast is quite expensive, as they say, but very parisian and we recommend taking a long lunch beside the windows. Sip a cup of coffee, read a news paper and relax. The rooms are so very nice and actually quite ..sexy. I loved the dressing/bathroom. :)) Don't forget to have a drink in the bar, when you feel for it. We had a late night-cap, and strongly recommend it. We will absolutely return again, for a nice get away. The hotel is located perfectly.

It is about a 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe and even a bit shorter to the Champs-Elysees. The common areas and rooms are tastefully furnished with a high level of finish. We especially like the deep bathtub and separate shower stall in the bathroom, with the sink area separated for easy use of facilities by more than one person. The bed was firm and comfortable. The windows can be opened wide for fresh air and the rooms facing the courtyard are especially quiet with a nice view. The hotel staff from check-in to concierge and the breakfast room were very friendly and accommodating. (We give special acknowledgement to Clarisse, who is a real gem!) The daily internet fee of 22 Euros is a bit steep, but typical of Paris hotels and we were pleased to have the service available in our room. The desk staff provided us with a converter so that our U.S.-type laptop could be recharged during our stay. The immediate neighborhood is not a terribly active one, although there are some brasseries, etc. within several blocks' walk. In summary, we found the Hilton Arc de Triomphe to be an excellent choice for what is very much a higher end property at comparatively realistic rates in Paris.", "Date": "January 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hotel With Perfect Staff\u201d", "Author": "mparel", "ReviewID": "UR4314911", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay in this hotel. We rely on trip advisor for hotel reviews, so we thought we should add ours. From check-in to departure, everything was perfect. We were escorted to the executive level for an expresso while registering then escorted to the room. As in the brochure and on the hotel web site, the room had a balcony and a picture perfect view of the Eiffel Tower. It was ready for our 9:30 AM arrival, even though I had requested an early 10 AM check-in. As others have noted, this is a newer hotel (almost 2 years old, I think)and everything is still in excellent condition from the bedding to the baths. The rooms and baths really are like the pictures. Our plasma TV did indeed work just fine. The executive lounge is wonderful: Madame Catherine will even make dinner reservations for you. Refreshments and snacks (including beer, excellent wines and champagnes - complimentary) were served throughout the day starting with breakfast and constantly replenished. Dinner in the hotel restaurant was a very pleasant experience. The wait staff, especially Mademoiselle Cira, was excellent and the food was far superior to many of the restaurants having one of the coveted stars. My husband says I am too picky when it comes to hotels, and we have stayed in some of the best in the world (e.g., Lord Byron - Rome, Mauna Kea Resort- Hawaii, Peninsula - Hong Kong) but in all honesty, I have absolutly nothing but good things to say about this Hilton. We paid a discounted rate for our room (#777 on the top floor) yet experienced first class service. As long as the hotel maintains the service and ambiance that we experienced this time, we intend to stay here whenever we are in Paris.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calif", "Title": "\u201cWiting this review from my room ..\u201d", "Author": "sunstonetours", "ReviewID": "UR4042653", "Content": "This was a last minute weekend in Paris.

The hallway, doors, carpet, even the number font on each door is consistant detail to Art Deco. I honor what a good job this hotel has done and love how it is carried out in the rooms and bathroom as well. Location is a good 5 minute walk to the main blvd.

The reception desk was great and very helpful and we were allowed to check into our room very early. This was a bonus as we did want a nap before going out. We were upgraded to a King deluxe suite which consisted on two bathrooms (only one with a bath), living room and a separate bedroom. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the suite and hotel is nice. Besides reception, service was virtually none existent. We called three times to have the plasma TV in our bedroom repaired as there was no reception. When the technician did show up he said very little except the TV was broken which we already knew. He offered us nothing and then my husband asked if the regular TV set in the living room could be moved to the bedroom. He swapped the TVs and we suspect whoever stays in the room next (room 424) will have to make a few calls if they wish to watch TV in the lounge area. The hallway leading to our room was constantly littered and quite a few stains on the carpets. When we arrived there were dirty drinking glasses in front of our door and when we left (two days later) the same glass was there. Kid you not. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like they were concealed. Room service was appalling and way overpriced even by Paris standards. We ordered a cheese plate that came with two small pieces of cheese (mold and all) and a small bistro salad, a croque monsieur that was cold and bottle of Evian for 50 euros. Had the food been good food, no problem, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give room service a good review. We also had access to the Executive Lounge. The food offerings were slim. It was okay for a drink before going out, but the EL was not worth the upgrade price. Again the service was non-existent and the lounge is pretty much self service. We have stayed in many hotels in Paris and this is not one we would rush back to.

Very romantic hotel with marble bathroom, great toilitries and four large towels, the size of beach towels. Breakfast was just okey...but very expensive - about 30 euros per person. I never made it to the spa because we were so close to the tourist sites and there was so much to do. The Arc de Triomph was a five minute walk, as was the metro station. The Hilton staff was wonderful at speaking English and very informative in helping us with a show at the \"Lido\" and providing huge hotel umbrellas for the days it rained.
