Although the room was comfortable, the decor was \"tatty\" and the room smelled of vanilla from the Glade Plugin that was turned up full behind the chair.

Then the Four Seasons opened, and the Ritz had real competition for the first time. Thirty years later, the Four Seasons is no longer a Four Seasons (first a Westin, and now an Omni) and some would argue, The Ritz-Carlton is not much of a Ritz-Carlton anymore. I think that is a bit harsh. While this Ritz is not a part of the Ritz-Carlton chain any longer. . .it was for awhile. . .this hotel was the first Ritz-Carlton in North America, even pre-dating the Ritz in Boston (also no longer part of the Ritz-Carlton chain). In short, a great bit of hotel history and a Montreal landmark of thousands of bar mitzvahs and weddings. What the hotel is today is a bit faded albeit well maintained, but still quite gracious and possessing the best westside location in Montreal--Holt Renfrew is next door, The Musee des Beaux Arts is nearby, and Mont Royal is just steps away. I found the service professional and thorough, if a bit stiff, though if this hotel is no longer a real Ritz, no one told the staff. The hallways are wide, bright and very Ritz-Carlton, with the rooms solid and a throwback to another era. My room, while not large, was spacious enough, with crown moldings, high ceilings, a chandelier, expensive sheets, and a rather thoughtful foyer with a double door to keep hallway noise out. I'm sure the bathroom was among the most elegant in the city in 1969 when it was likely last renovated, but the shower is great, the walls lined in marble, the amenities are from Bulgari, and there is both a phone and a shaving mirror. The bed was a bit more firm than I like, and the armoire was scuffed--if you seek wireless internet, flat screen TVs, or other technology, keep looking. Dated and faded it is, but it is nearly Parisian in its elegance, and singular in its romantic charms. Lobby, public spaces and famed restaurant are still elegant--though food and beverage are notably expensive. Better to grab a noteworthy steak frites at L'Entrecote de St. Jean, a few blocks away on Peel. . . For those seeking exercise while staying here, the hotel has a small exercise room--two treadmills, two bikes--but furnishes free passes to MAAA which is a swank health club three blocks away. Sounds great, though in bitter winter weather, it is less attractive than it might appear at first, given the walk. Disclaimer here--I got this hotel for $75 a night on Hotwire, which is a tremendous bargain. By contrast, a room at The Ritz-Carlton New York is $595 a night, and just the tax on that amount is more than the room in Montreal. So it is not as nice as the Manhattan hotel, but certainly is a noteworthy bargain by comparison. There are extensive plans to renovate and add onto this hotel into a condo/hotel complex. Until those plans are conclusive, The Ritz in Montreal proves a great bargain, an interesting slice of Montreal's history, and a wonderful base from which to discover one of North America's most exciting cities.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cNice stay at the Ritz\u201d", "Author": "chatterbox-2007", "ReviewID": "UR12342185", "Content": "Stayed at the Ritz in downtown Montreal, a few blocks from the Peel metro station which was convenient.

We were torn between this hotel and staying at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth since the rates and standards are supposedly comparable, but decided on the Ritz because of its location. With taxes, our bill for just the rooms came out to $324 for the 2 nights, and because we parked (valet only), we were charged another $60. I read up on the hotel before our stay and learned that this hotel is no longer part of the Ritz-Carlton chain of hotels and has only kept its name. We went in with no expectations, though judging from the other guests at the hotel, they expected this place to still be the hoity-toity hotel that it probably once was. Every guest we encountered gave us a snooty look and most were well into their 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I felt like we were the youngest guests there and though we were treated respectfully when we checked in and out, not once did the front desk or concierge acknowledge us when we walked through the lobby and never did the doorman open the door for us, even as we walked directly up to him. The hotel has a pretty old fashion feel to it and has very traditional d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The hallways are long and smell like really strong perfume or potpourri. We stayed in a standard room, which was a good size with a small foyer and bathroom separate from the bedroom by a hallway. Our window looked out onto Sherbrooke Street and let in a lot of light during the day. We checked in late at night and were pleasantly surprised to walk into a perfectly warm room. The heating system works well to maintain the temperature, but it is a bit loud being so close to the bed and I was woken up by it a few times in the night. The bathroom is in some serious need of updating. I actually laughed when I turned on the lights. The bathroom is completely beige: beige taupe tiles on the walls, beige sink, toilet and bathtub. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent size, but the floor was a bit cold and I was a bit surprised that they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a bath mat. Because of the colour, the bathroom felt a bit grimy, but it was in fact quite clean, which is really important for me when judging hotels. The hot water pressure was a bit low, but now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just getting nit-picky. The shower pressure was decent and the toiletries are Bvlgari. Their towels still have the Ritz-Carlton logo, but they must\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been pretty used because they felt heavily starched and crunchy. We used the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business centre, which consists of 2 computers and a printer. We were happy not to have to pay to use the internet and the centre is open 24 hours a day. The valet parking was very speedy, and so was the bellman who brought us our bags (it was 1am). Overall, we would stay here again for the right price. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at other hotels in Montreal and the rate is competitive, especially considering the level of cleanliness and the king size bed with high thread-count sheets! The location is ideal and at least the employees weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flat out rude to our face.

The lobby is lovely, service was excellent, and the room was spotlessly clean and nicely appointed. Much like any hotel in this category, they really screw you on the extras. Don't bother with breakfast--you can do better at nearby Eggspectations for a big breakfast or much cheaper at any of the many downtown coffee shops for a coffee and pastry. The bathroom was probably the part that showed the most age, but it was by no means unpleasant. It just didn't look like it had been recently refurbished. It was very clean, and the toiletries were high-quality. Nice bathrobes, too. I would certainly stay at the Ritz again if I got a bargain. It's well-located (near the Metro, underground city, McGill campus, many restaurants, museums) and quite nice. A hint (not related to the Ritz): Don't bother with the Aerobus service to/from the airport. It's very unreliable, and we might have missed our flight if we'd sat around waiting for the Aerobus to arrive.

Most of our stay was really great - the room was clean, the towels fluffy and the housekeepers ever-present. The staff was friendly and helpful. We did have one problem - When making our reservation we expressly requested accommodations on a high floor so the street noise or any noise would be minimal - especially during the evening hours. Everything was fine until the evenings when we found out that the main ballroom (which was apparently located below our room) was booked for2 proms and a wedding - a function every night of our stay. We could hear the booming music in our room every evening. When we called the front desk the first two evenings, they apologized for the inconvenience and said that the functions would last only until 10 PM. This seemed reasonable and it wasn't until the third evening when the band was still blasting away at 11:30 PM, that we called the front desk again and asked for the Manager on duty - She also apologized for the noise and inconvenience and acknowledged that this was a known problem; in fact, it is a problem that the hotel management has been aware of for some time. When we asked what time the function was going to end, we were told that the ball room was booked until 3AM. We suggested that perhaps we could be moved to different accommodations,but she did not respond. She did say that she would ask the band's manager to lower the volume. Apparently, she was not very effective because we could still hear the music well into the A.M. hours - in fact, sometimes it even sounded louder. . Needless to say, we had very few hours of sleep that night. The next morning, while settling our bill at the front desk there was no mention of the noise or inconvenience to us. To make matters worse, we needed return home early so we needed to have breakfast at 7:30 AM. Both of our breakfasts were delayed and when they finally came, they were really poor - cold eggs and soggy pancakes. Our waiter informed us that the chef/cook forgot to turn on the griddle so it had not heated properly before the breakfast was prepared. To his credit, our waiter did apologize for the inconvenience and offered us another breakfast selection. We were disappointed in these experiences and needless to say, they really put a damper on our weekend - which was supposed to celebrate our 35th anniversary and my birthday.

There was no roll-up bed in the dreary and dusty living room, which looked as though no one had been there in years. A few chairs were clumped together at the window and the rest of the room was totally empty. It would be hard to conjur up a less welcoming scene. The two beds in the main bedroom were lumpy but we had more problems with the noise from outside. $540 a night only buys you a third-floor suite overlooking Sherbrooke Avenue, one of the busiest streets in Montreal. So all night there were various vehicles zooming by and when the bars emptied in the early morning hours, we were treated to shouts and hollering as drinkers made their way home.

This was our second visit to the Ritz in Montreal (see my previous review titled \"A Gracious Experience\"), and we have previously stayed at the Ritz in Washington D.C. multiple times and once at Buckhead (Atlanta). In December 2005, we were guests of the Ritz-Carlton Rose Hall in Montego Bay. I note these travel experiences for the purpose of context and because several reviews here opine that the Ritz Montreal is not up to the standards of the chain. We had a rate of $190.00 plus tax, which included valet parking and the American breakfast for two. The menu price for the American was $25.00 per person (juice, choice of eggs or griddle cakes, choice of sausages, bacon, or ham, garnished with potatoes and tomatoes, coffee, tea and a lovely basket of croissants, muffins and pain au chocolat). Parking in many Montreal hotels can run $20.00 - $30.00. We considered the rate outstanding value. The hotel is most definitely showing its age and is in serious need of refitting. Our suite, although not the impressive salon that we enjoyed on a previous visit, was still a nice size and well outfitted. The linens, bedding, toweling, robes, and toiletries were all to the Ritz standards. The bathroom, however, was a disgrace: peeling paint, stained wallpaper, a large mirror that was missing silver in many places, several cracked tiles, and a chipped enamel-over- steel sink. Similalrly, the maintenance of the dining room was poor: the windows were filthy with finger and hand prints and grime, the wall sconces were ALL askew, and the walls and wood trim were chipped and scratched. Since our last visit, the Universal-type weight machines in the gym has been removed, and only free weights, two treadmills, one step machine, and a bike were available. We also were put off by a large number of children and adults who were not registered at the hotel but were attending an audiiton. Many of these hopefuls filled the lobby and their presence diminished the Ritz experience. The service in the restaurant, bar, and at the front desk was still pleasing. Once again, we were delighted with the concierge. Tommy secured reservations at our e-mail request at two restaurants on the dates and times that we requested, even though they were heavily booked. As for comparisons to other Ritz hotels: This is difficult because the hotel is significantly older than the others at which we stayed. In terms of upkeep, I'd have to say that it is the worst. Not up to Ritz snuff. In terms of service, it comparable to the others, with the exception of Rose Hall, which is by far the very best hotel at which we've ever stayed anywhere. However, Rose Hall is a resort and, hence, comparisons are not fair. Interestingly, we are considering a possible trip to Philadelphia in August and a brief survey of reviews of the Ritz-Carlton there indicates that, at least in the in the minds of some, that hotel is not up to Ritz standards. We sould still return again if we could secure a good rate. The location is terrific, the hotel has clout with restaurants and other businesses, and there is a certain old world charm to the place.", "Date": "January 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "upstate New York", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel at these prices\u201d", "Author": "BigGuyUpstateNY", "ReviewID": "UR4228554", "Content": "This is one of the traditional grand hotels and an incredible bargain considering the level of service. I regularly travel to New York and Chicago and other major US cities, as well as Canada and can compare this hotel to others in its class. I agree with some reviewers that the rooms are a bit worn or natty in places. And I mean \"just a bit\". Also, the plumbing fixtures and the A/C were just ordinary. But this is comparable to other old hotels I've stayed in. If you need an immaculate neat room, you need to stick with high end chains and you will pay much more for them. The level of service at the Ritz-Carlton was quite good. The daytime doorman was a bit stonefaced but I would overlook that for the high level of interest we received from everyone else. One of the things I like about older hotels like the Ritz Carlton is that they have real furniture, like solid wood chairs and side tables. Even the old fashion marble tile in the bathroom harks back to a kind of elegance not found in hotels in urban downtowns. We looked in the Ballroom lobby and Ballroom of this hotel, and they are stunningly elelgant. Beautifully appointed throughout. Look at the ballroom in a Hyatt or Westin. They're pathetic. The only hotels I've stayed in that compare with the Ritz-Carlton are the old CP hotels, like the Frontenac, Laurier and Empress. A handful of similar places survive in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. I travelled with two business companions and all three of our rooms were standard rate and were quite nice. I was on a smoking floor and it was too smokey smelling for me, but until Montreal realizes that, in general, they need to crack down on smoking in public places, this will be a problem in nice hotels and restaurants.

I notice someone mentioned the heaters a la Motel 6 - keep in mind this hotel opened in 1912, central heating didnt exist back them, it was likely radiators that were later replaced by a wall/window unit.
