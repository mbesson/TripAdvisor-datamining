Even the sauses were presented in saches that i would expect from a cafe rather than a restaurant. I found my food to be the worst i've had in many a year from the over seasoned fowl tasting broccoli soup, to the steak pie that i struggled to find one tiny peice of meat in (it should have been called beef flavoured shortcrust) to the freezer burnt lemon tart. Of course when asked about our stay i simply said 'fine thankyou' in my usual fashion.

Better than a travelodge but if I had paid the full price as was advertised I would have been extremely unhappy!! We enjoyed most of the food, but the dinner choice was rather limited and the goat's cheese tart starter was of extremely poor quality.

We stayed on the 4th floor and in a twin room. View was of the back/alley, but wasn't bad. The thing we noticed straight away was the strong smell of urine coming from the bathroom. There is no way to air the bathroom, no windows or fan so it just stank the whole time. My sister had a closer look and it seemed to be the shower curtain! Ewwww. We spent most of the time out of the hotel in fact we only just got there in time to check in at 6.45pm and was scheduled to have our free dinner in the brasserie at 7pm. Note:- you should NOT eat here for dinner. But if you must, and it was free which was the only reason we ate there that night, book your table time in advance, I.e. the day you book your stay! When we checked in, the lady on the desk told us of we hadn't have booked our time ahead, the soonest we could eat would have been 8.30pm! About the dinner. Where to start. The staff, In particular, Reba, practically threw plates of food down, no eye contact, no manners, no converstion whatsoever. I asked for mayo, a different fork (my sisters was sticky -ewww), and the eye rolls that came with it. Wow. Things seemed like too much trouble for some of the staff on the dinner shift. The main thing about the dinner was the lack of hygiene. I am pregnant, so it's even more important I don't get food poisoning or such like. I watched, and their method of cleaning their tables between sittings, was a tea towel. Dry. Vaguely wiping crumbs off. No cleaning spray, no nothing! I was quite shocked. No wonder the table was sticky! The breakfast however, was a TOTALLY different experience! The food was fresh and amazing service. The hygiene still lacked, but after such an awful dinner, breakfast was a total shock. All you can eat of everything! The next morning, after quite a comfy bed to sleep in, we checked out. The kind man asked us how it was and we couldn't lie. But to be honest we didn't lay in to them. We just said it in a nice way, and he assured us he was going to address these issues or how else would they improve? Fair point. And he also, refunded us \u00c2\u00a340!

I've added pictures that I hope show the chipped and tatty quality - the super secure door lock that looked like it had been subject frequently to a forced entry was particularly scary!

Hotel itsef is in a good location, quite central, 5 mins walk from tube station, bus route outside, and Hyde Park literally across the road. Queensway is also a five minute walk and full of restaurants, couple of supermarkets, shops etc so in that respect a good area to stay. Its also just slightly set back so noise is not an issue. This time round my stay didnt start too well. I was given a double room and having unpacked decided to have a shower .... but it didnt work. had to call reception a couple of times before they came to sort, and agreed to move me to another room ... where the shower also didnt work. Again took more calls and about an hour later I got moved to a \"Sky Suite\" which book price shows at \u00c2\u00a3350 a night !! To be fair to the hotel did resove, and did upgrade me but there seemed little urgency to resolve and I dd have to do all the chasing. Its also worth adding that the suite is actually no more than a standard double room in most hotels. The room itself was fine, comfy, good air con, nice bathroom etc so no complaints there. Having said that a couple of my colleagues were in single rooms on the mezzanine floor and these were tiny ... not much room at all. The bar/restaurant is ok, good service, and my colleagues who had dinner said the food was good. I only had breakfast which was normal mix of hot/cold buffet. Putting the shower problems to the side the hotel is OK. It is supposedly a 4 star but I would class more as 3 star. It is clean, the service is good, so in that respect I wouldnt want to put anyone off particularly if you have already booked.

I reserved my room through Ramada.com. I normally don't like Ramada's in the US, but have found their properties abroad better. My rate included breakfast, but when I checked in I was told that it didn't. The front desk agent wanted proof and needed a printed confirmation. With nowhere to print, I was asked to email the reception my confirmation showing them that my rate included breakfast. I was immediately put off with her attitude. The hallways have no ventilation and London was experiencing rather hot weather. When I got to my room, it was stifling. In order to operate the power in the room, you need to insert your room key in an outlet to operate the lights. ac, etc. I immediately did so hoping the room would cool off. Sadly, it never did. The room itself was larger than I anticipated. It appeared to have been renovated in the last few years, but the renovations were not done well. The carpeting looked new and room was relatively nice looking at first glance. BUT after closer inspection I found many things wrong. The desktop was chipped in places and peeling off, the tile in the entry way and bathroom stained, the door frame was chipped and tattered and my door wouldn't shut unless pulled shut. The bath tub was chipped and water was leaking from an upper drain. The air conditioning unit really didn't work. The room never really cooled off and in the evening, it was nicer to be outside than in the room. Due to safety concerns, you couldn't open the window more than a few inches. It remained uncomfortable. The next morning before I left the hotel, I had asked for the a/c unit to be checked out and the leaking water to be repaired. The a/c was never fixed. When I returned to the hotel at 5:00, my room had still not been serviced. I called and then left for a couple of hours. At 8:00, my room still had not been serviced. I was not pleased. The hotel is used by lot's of tour groups. Throughout the night and in the morning, you could hear doors slamming shut. If you're a light sleeper, this could be a problem. Breakfast wasn't anything special, but I found the staff in the restaurant to be friendly, courteous, and professional. The concierge was also helpful. While not super friendly at first, he helped me arrange for transport to Heathrow. When they did not show up at the arranged time, he immediately called without my asking. He came out to tell me that he had called and that a car would be here within 15 minutes. The hotel is in a nice location.

Booked a double room through Laterooms.com which they charged us \u00c2\u00a3180 for a one night stay. With the location of this hotel, we thought we had a really good deal...... on arrival, they told us we had a twin, upon showing them our booking confirmation they told us they were fully booked and had no doubles available, so we asked for a small discount on our bill to make up for their mistake. Amazingly a double room suddenly became \"available\" and we were given an upgrade..... Room 750 \"Executive Double\". What a complete joke. Tiny room, No mini bar, window unopenable, noisiest air conditioning unit I have ever heard in a hotel room, the bare basics of 1 shampoo, 1 shower gel, soap and 1 bath towel for 2 people!! As we got back from meeting friends so late, we decided to stick it out for the night. The room was like a sauna, so the inneficial air conditioning was vital sadly as at 3am it sounded like a plane taking off. At around 1am we ordered room service, and the most bizarre thing happened. When it arrived, i tried to explain to the deliverer that sadly I didn't have a penny of cash to tip him. He then told me the room service came to 40 pounds and that I should go to reception and pay by card!!!!!!!!!!!!! In my pyjamas and bare feet!!!!!!!! Was he that desperate for me to include a tip!!?? Confused and befudled I simply shut the door on him. I don't know if this was a joke or if he was as grumpy and odd as he appeared to be, but either way I didn't appreciate it. I don't go anywhere in my pyjamas with large men in the early hours of the morning even if they do think they are entitled to a tip for doing there job. The room had so many defects it's pointless to list them all, but believe me, everything from a sink plug that didn't open properly to dusty carpets it was a shambles. If we had paid full price for this farce it would have been a staggering \u00c2\u00a3380. As it was paying \u00c2\u00a3180 for it felt like a rip off. Plus \u00c2\u00a325 carparking fees it felt like a scam. If it wasn't for the fab location I would have given this hotel just 1 star. I've read the feedback from the manager regarding refurbs, maybe room 750 was given to us simply as they had cocked our booking up and they don't usually use this room?? I desperately hope that this is the case and they don't actually charge anybody \u00c2\u00a3380 for this \"executive\" room and that it is waiting to be refurbed. We didn't complain on the day as in the morning we had a mad rush to appointments, I have mobile video footage of the room, and when I eventually work out how to upload it onto my computer I'll happily send it to Ramada. Sadly I feel Ramada have tourists and business customers over a barrel here. The location is great and rooms around this area are not easy to get at short notice.

We have previously stayed in the Ealing hotel in the Ramada chain, and liked it so we thought this one would be as good. On the whole, we enjoyed our stay, the room seemed to be slightly larger and a bit more luxurious than the rooms in the Ealing hotel, but we did have a few problems with noise. - It's a minor thing, but the tea/coffee tray was excellent! We was impressed with that ;) We stayed on the fourth floor, in a room overlooking the main road and Hyde Park. Traffic noise was instantly noticeable when we arrived in the room, yet surprisingly was not an issue for us, as we didn't notice it really when we went to bed. The thing that did cause us problems however, was noisy neighbours! We had a door in our room which adjoined us to the next room along (a feature I think present in most rooms on this floor, if not the whole hotel) - the door was locked obviously (but someone did try the handle one night when they arrived- somewhat off-putting whilst trying to go to sleep!) but did mean we could hear next door rather clearly. It was unfortunate that the first morning we were there next door were packing up very loudly early in the morning and had an alarm that kept going off. Another night we was kept awake by the next room along having a noisy gathering! However, I appreciate this is no fault of the hotel, it is just people being selfish. If you are a really light sleeper, I would probably say this hotel isn't for you, due to thin walls and traffic noise, but I would still recommend it. The reception staff were friendly and tried to help wherever they could. One issue we did have was the concierge on duty the morning we were leaving was very bad-tempered, and he didn't listen when we had said that one of our items to be put in luggage storage was fragile (a canvas), and he was very abrupt and heavy-handed with our luggage which did stress me out somewhat as I was anxious to keep the canvas in one piece! He seemed very rude and did not give a good impression of the hotel. The other members of the concierge team we spoke to (namely the young man with glasses and the other concierge on duty that afternoon we were leaving) were very helpful and friendly. We chose not to include breakfast in our package, so we can't comment on that. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and nice enough. The only thing I would say about the bathroom is the shower head is rather low, I am only 5 ft 7 and I had to stoop a little bit to get under the shower! My husband at 6 ft obviously had more trouble than me. Again, not such an issue as we still had a nice stay. The hotel is I would say middle budget level for London, and we were happy enough with it. The location was brilliant, it was about 5 min walk to Queensway tube station, which is on the Central line and can take you directly into the centre of town in about 10 mins. We also walked through Hyde Park one morning all the way into the centre (Oxford Circus, Regent Street) and although it was quite a long walk, it was a lovely way to start the day :) There is a spar right near the tube station, and there are coffee shops and restaurants nearby so easy enough to find what you need. Overall we enjoyed our stay, we had a good honeymoon, but there are definite issues with noise - due to the adjoining room layout. We would probably stay here again if we go to London again, as it is a pleasant hotel despite the noise, and in a great location - not very far (10 min walk I think) from Paddington Station.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNot a 4 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "Alex044", "ReviewID": "UR111615301", "Content": "Stayed here for the weekend of June 5-6.

The room was clean and albeit a bit on te small side when the sofa bed was pulled out but manageable.

Having been allocated rooms above the function room also meant that we did not get any peace until 1 am when it stopped despite complaining and also having a child with us meant she got very tired too. Breakfast was a bit of a nightmare the following morning with the hotel not replenishing food as it was getting towards the end of service. Bearing in mind we were late to bed because of hotel noise we were late to breakfast too! Our second night and second experience of breakfast was very different in a positive way. We had complained adn really complained! We couldn't get any refund as I had paid with vouchers but what the hotel did do was offer us a complimentary night stay within 6 months.

Decided to book two rooms one for the teens, who are pretty independant at 17 and 14 and one for us. Phoned to book initially through Ramada's Central Reservations number. I would have liked adjoining rooms, one twin for the boys and one double for the grown ups, but was advised adjoining rooms weren't possible but would book rooms next to each other. The advisor confirmed that he had allocated the rooms while I was on the phone and all seemed to go smoothly, with follow up emails etc. Different story when we arrived, as rooms hadn'nt been booked (despite the fact we'd paid in advance) and they only rooms they had were on different floors. We were really annoyed as this was one of the reasons I booked with this hotel, but they said they didn't have any rooms together as they were pretty full that weekend. When shown the rooms the twin was very disappointing, and run down with old scratched wooden furniture and had a grubby feel about it. Back to reception to complain and another room was found. To her credit the receptionist was sympathetic and took us to show us another room to see if it was ok, which it was, although still on another floor to our room. This was really inconvenient as alot of stuff was packed together so we were up and down floors to take things from one room to another. On the whole however the Hotel was quite nice. The location was good, as others have said, although the lift at Queensway station was a bit of a bind as only one was ever working. Breakfast was good and beds very comfortable. Cleaning staff were vewry keen as they kept trying to clean the rooms before we had gone out. On the Sunday, on which the hotel advertise breakfast as lazy breakfast served until 12.00pm, one of the staff burst into our room at about 7.45 when she didn't get an answer after knocking on our door, because we were asleep!

It has since become a more expensive option, but I recently found an attractive offer through booking.com of \u00c2\u00a355 per night for a single room. The hotel is a modern white building, nicely located opposite Hyde Park on the long Bayswater Road, between Notting Hill and the Marble Arch end of Oxford Street. It is within walking distance of the Notting Hill shops and public transport is close at hand, with a bus stop virtually outside the hotel and the Queensway tube station only a couple of minutes walk away. The reception area is nice and spacious, and I found the check-in staff to be pleasant and efficient. However, on the way to my room, I felt the corridors looked dated and tired, in much need of decoration. My room was on a side street, away from the busy Bayswater Road. It was therefore a relatively quiet room and had a large wall-to-wall window, which let in a fair amount of light. Although a single room (and therefore small), the bed was wider than a normal single. I found the furnishings to be quite tasteful and pleasing, but again the decor was in need of freshening up, with torn/peeling wallpaper in evidence. A generously-sized LCD TV was provided, and a nice touch was complimentary bottles of still and sparkling water. The ensuite bathroom included a full-size bath with shower over. The bath wasn't very inviting, being slightly grimy, particularly at the shower end. However, I was impressed by the powerful shower which provided ample hot water. Breakfast wasn't included in my room rate, but was available for \u00c2\u00a310 if booked at least a day in advance, or \u00c2\u00a315 if you turned up without booking. I didn't take the breakfast. The check-out time for this hotel is 12 noon, which is very convenient for those guests who don't need to leave early. The Ramada Hyde Park remains a very good option in central London, although does require some cosmetic updating.

Not knowing how long we might sleep we were undecided - then we were told that if we didn't decide tonight, it would cost an extra 5 GBS for a decision in the morning!! Needless to say this did not go down very well with two extremely tired people!! Unfortunately this hotel is very dated, and tired looking and the rooms are no different. We found the staff quite abrupt and uncaring. The location however is great with lots of buses passing the door as well as a short walk to restaurants and a very good internet cafe. The breakfast was excellent, (yes decided to go for the buffet breakfast) plenty of variety and a great cup of tea. Also a big screen TV for those addicted to the morning bulletin. One small problem was that the time of breakfast varied each day and no staff member has the forsight to tell us. One unfortunate incident was the fire alarm going off at 12.15 am, everyone evacuated and the fire dept turned up. I suppose these things happen but it was a false alarm and ended up disturbing the sleep of all hotel patrons for no reason. On check-out, we were overcharged but once this was pointed out our bill was quickly amended. Another thing totally overlooked by the staff on our day of check -out was a large bowl of flowers in the centre of the lobby - unfortunately well past their use by date in other words three quarter dead!

Generally speaking Notting Hill has the best pub/restaurant/cafe scene in London. The rooms are ok, a bit smallish, don't get stuck with the single rooms which are particularly small, but the rest are pretty comfortable and clean.

It was the middle choice among three grades of hotel offered but it left me regretting I hadn't opted for the slightly more expensive choice. First, there was confusion upon check-in. We arrived mid-afternoon after a long train journey from Glasgow, and since we had been told to check in with the host of the tour company, we tried waiting for her to be free to speak with us, but finally lost patience and went to the desk. Whereupon we were checked in but were told we had to get our keys from the tour company host. Of course, when we finally did speak to the host, she told us we had to get our keys from the desk clerk. Back to the desk, where the clerk seemed annoyed with us. Finally, keys in hand to a room number beginning with a \"1\", we head for the elevator (two weeks in the UK had taught us that the first floor and the ground floor, were we were standing, were not the same thing) only to be told to go through some doors on the ground floor to find the room. Through a dark corridor we went, already not wanting to be on the ground floor, and this was confirmed when we saw the window looking right out onto the street and only one bed in the room. ( I was travelling with my daughter and all our hotel reservations were for twin beds). We returned to the desk to ask for another room. The room we were then given was technically not on the ground floor, but on a \"mezzanine\", which was something I hadn't seen in any of the seven other hotels I'd stayed in, two of them also Ramadas. After getting off the elevator there was a short flight of steps up to a door, and then another dark corridor. The room had twin beds at least, but the view was overlooking an alley featuring dumpsters. Too tired to go back, we setled for this room. This was the first hotel where we had to leave a room key in a slot to keep the elecricity running. The bedding was fairly comfortable, the bathroom could have had more space for toiletries, but everything was clean enough. We didn't leave the curtains open most of the time we were there, for privacy reasons, and despite putting on every light in the room it always seemed too dark. Our included breakfast was a typical buffet, with sufficient variety of decent food and enough seating. and good service. The desk staff was very unaccomodating when I asked to cash a twenty pound sterling traveler's check. Finally they agreed, scrutinized my passport for a long time, photocopied it, and eventually handed over the measly twenty pounds. The location was convenient in that you could walk to two or three tube stations (Queensway, Bayswater, or Notting Hill Gate) a lot of buses passed by but none of them seemed to be going anywhere we wanted to go, so we used the tube. Queensway, the main restaurant/shopping street nearby, was crammed with all kinds of ethnic restaurants and a mind-boggling array of people from all over the world. A lot of the restaurants featured outdoor seating with people smoking water pipes. The shops were mostly cheap and trashy. We ate in two of the restaurants there and found the food okay, but the service arrogant, as if they were doing us a big favor. And mind you, my daughter and I were not pulling any ugly American act, either. So altogether, this hotel and its location did not live up to my expectations and did not add anything to our experience, but we managed to enjoy our stay in London anyway.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cloved the ramada\u201d", "Author": "londongal84", "ReviewID": "UR8473122", "Content": "stayed at this hotel near xmas time for a weekend. booked a standard double room but received a free upgrade to a suite which was big with an extremely comfy bed and had a great view.friendly staff, allowed us to stay an xtra night for the same rate we had payed on the internet.great breakfast and room service.location ok as is near the a tube station.excellent value for money.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cGood if the price is right\u201d", "Author": "dongola", "ReviewID": "UR8370190", "Content": "Stayed here for a night in August.

The beds were heaven. Clean and comfortable. There was air conditioning which was great as it was very warm that weekend. The hotel is set quietly at the back of Hyde park, but bus stops outside and 2 tube stations within 5 mins walk make getting anywhere so easy. The tour bus stops here too. How easy do you want it.

The beds are a generous size and super comfy, the amenities were modern and inviting.
