{"Reviews": [{"Content": "First Class All The Way! This was our first trip to Italy and we stayed in great hotels in Milan, Florence, Rome and Naples. But this hotel was our favorite and when we return, we will stay here again! The ambiance of the hotel is extraordinary! Beautifully appointed from the grand entry and throughout! The staff couldn't have been more warm and helpful to us! Our favorite two are Lodovico and Nassino (sorry this spelling is wrong) at the front desk! I couldn't tell you how well they treated us and went the extra step to make sure our stay was perfect. While we were there the art exhibit was Andrea Stella and it was exceptional. Nassino went so far as to secure a book of his work and had the artist sign it for us! Lodovico secured tickets for us to the Vatican Musuem! These were only two of the things they did for us! We have traveled quite a bit and this personal service was the best ever! Our room was wonderful, the lounge was confortable, the bar area was a perfect place to relax after a full day and the breakfast in the morning was beautifully presented and had more food choices than you could hope for.....great coffee too! This is a rather long review.....we could go on and on! Thank you to all the staff for making our visit to Florence one we won't soon forget!

We had the pleasure of staying at the Borghese from Nov 1st thru Nov 5th of 2007. the weeks leading to our departure back to italy i was in close contact with the front desk of the Borghese making sure everything was set as this was going to be a special trip with my mother making her first european venture. Not only were we able to check in early, our rooms were fantastic. everything was well appointed - so much so that when people view our room pics, they all want to know about the decor. The location is central and an esay walk to all corners of the city. The Duomo is less than 8 mins away by foot, the accademia maybe 12 and the Uffiizi is so close that you can be there withn 5 mins walk. What made are stay even more enchanting was their terrace. It has a cozy welcoming feel. you can almost feel the presence of Florence's past lives up there. Athough we didnt utilize the spa area, it is pleasing to the eye and very unique in design. the light show bathes the ancient stone and rock walls in soft pastel light and the sauna looks more inviting then the gelato we ate in Piazza Signoria. The staff was very attentive and easily accessible. Like i said above, i was in contact almost daily with the staff and when we arrived, i was excited to learn that they had my reservations booked at La Giostra for that friday night! Talk to them about excusrsions outside the city to either the outlet stores or the many beautiful towns and villages that dot the tuscan landscape. they have a driver/tourguide for hire and the hotel is willing to book a trip for about 110 euros, depending on destination.Great staff, hotel and location....thanks Borghese and i look forward to yet another return visit to flroence.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR427600466", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "johnsharpe"}, {"Content": "lovely, clean,smart hotel This hotel is perfectly situated in florence. its a stones throw away from everything yet in a quiet street.

Our experience with the hotel was very similar to the other previous posts.

We spent our days and evenings walking around Florence enjoying the sights and looked forward to resting our feet and sleeping at night. That did not happen.We were also not overly impressed with the rooms. Our shower stall was very small and the water from the bathroom sink sprayed all over the place. The water pressure was also erratic. The hallyways are marble flooring so be prepared to hear everything outside your door. The walls in the rooms are paper thin. We could hear the plumbing, hair dryer and light switches being turned off/on in the room next to us. I do expect some noise in a hotel but hearing the water go down the drain in the next room is not typical hotel noise.I wish we had a better experience at this hotel but we didn't.

Food included cereals, fruit, yogurt, breads, pastries, cold meats and cheeses, and one hot dish, as well as juice and coffee. My only complaint is the noise outside of the hotel. We were awakened every single night when the night club across the street (the back of the hotel) let out, and the party on the street got started. They made A LOT of noise.

The Hotel service at reception and in the breakfast room was most welcoming and the rooms well decorated and comfortable. Breakfast was a very acceptable buffet, fresh and well stocked. You get the feeling that all the staff employed by the Hotel are very pleased to serve you and answer any queries you may have. They don't tell you about it but on Floor 3 there is a delightful little loggia cum open air terrace with views across to Santa Croce and the Florentine Hills. If you stand in one corner with your back to the view, there is a little window set in the wall of the terrace which perfectly frames a view of the Dome of the Dumo and the Campanile. It is a nice quiet little area to sit down and take a drink of something local after a long day doing the tourist haunts. However, the night club mentioned by previous reviewers, is a major let-down. It is open 6 nights a week from 11.30pm to around 4.30am. I couldn't hear any music, just the constant very loud talking, shouting and singing of young people hanging about the road outside literally all night long. Then you had about 30 minutes to 5.00am when the proprietor of the club swept up bottles and other rubbish outside and empty in the rubbish bins along the road. If you stay at the Borghese make sure you ask for one of the rooms that looks over the interior courtyard rather than the street - I am sure the night club noise is not a problem on the otherside of the corridor. Or else invest in some ear plugs. Apparently the Hotel have been trying to get the noise issue resolved with the club and the local Commune but to no avail - yet!The hotel is so centrally located, it could not be better located - 5 minute walk one way and you are at the Duomo and Baptistry; 30 seconds walk to the end of the road and you are at a great 13th century museum - The Bargello - where you can see Donatello's David and many other great pieces of art including some of Michaelangelo's; 1 minute's walk down another road fromt he hotel is Santa Croce (where Michaelangelo and Galileo are buried); about 4 minutes walk away is the Piazza della Signoria with its Palazzo Vechio and the Uffizi Gallery (must sees are the Botticelli's); the Ponte Vechio is about 8 minutes walk (fabulous jewellery shops - so hold on to your credit cards) and the Pritti Palace is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The Accademia with Michaelangelo's original David is more like 15 minutes away (its only a copy in the Pizza della Signoria). A little gem just down the same road as the Hotel at no 70, is charming Casa Buonarroti where Michaelangelo lived for a while and which his descendents set up as a sort of memorial to him after he died.When visiting the Duomo, it is well worth visiting the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo just across the road from the Duomo. It has been recently renovated and is beautifully set out in a modern and unstuffy style; here you can see Michaelangelo's Pieta, a number of Donatello's works plus some of the original tools used by Brunelleschi's workmen when building the dome as well as some other very important works of art that were originally installed in the Duomo and Baptistry.There seemed to be a good selection of eateries centrally located and you can buy some wonderful cakes in local patisseries and cafes to take away. If you go to the Ufizzi, it is well worth having a light meal or afternoon snack in their cafe cum bar on the top floor where, given the views and the location, the prices are very reasonable. If the weather is fine, you can sit outside on the terrace and enjoy your food whilst taking in the fine views of the surrounding buildings in the Palazzo Vecchio and across to the Duomo and Campanile.", "Date": "Nov 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR481636259", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "marinablue"}, {"Content": "Can't be beat for the price, but not 4 stars   showReview(5922676, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR486456836", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Denveresque"}, {"Content": "Great staff, but noisy   showReview(5880528, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR564748969", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TakingOff"}, {"Content": "Creative and Chic   showReview(5815429, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR337050868", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "met716"}, {"Content": "OK, not great   showReview(5804099, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR942584636", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cundip"}, {"Content": "Excellent hotel   showReview(5580742, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR897011628", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MatthewAlain"}, {"Content": "Great Find   showReview(5534166, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR169648524", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Wayne57"}, {"Content": "Definitely a palace   showReview(5425535, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR934862598", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jni"}, {"Content": "A fabulous hotel in every way   showReview(5392959, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR639244306", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SoCalFamily4"}, {"Content": "Loved this hotel!!   showReview(5326976, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR507254362", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "dboz05"}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bel H\u4e48tel.
