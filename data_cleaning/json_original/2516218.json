Even though it is a central city hotel, the way the building is positioned on the block made it very quiet, at least in our 10th floor room. Some reviewers have mentioned that they believed it used to be an Embassy Suites, I dont know about that, but it is definitely similar with a large open atrium in the center and glass elevators up and down. The location is a block away from the light rail station, so makes a quick, easy inexpensive trip to the sports venues and other downtown locations. We were here for a diamondbacks series. It has a interior pool with adjoining fitness room. The fitness room is well equipped for this type of hotel, with 3 treadmills and an eliptical, a bicycle, and a weight machine. We only had breakfast at the central atrium patio restaurant, but it was good and reasonably priced. If there is any downside there is not an abundance of other eateries within walking distance.

Our favorite shuttle driver was Johnny... He really knew a lot about Phoenix and recommended some great things to do. The hotel itself was very pretty. The glass elevators make the mundane activity of riding an elevator a breathtaking adventure. There were so many pretty plants in the hotel and they were real plants. The koi pond was very calming to look at. Hotel gym was pretty small, but they had passes to a larger gym if you were interested. I didn't go because I was happy with the cardio machines located on-site. The rooms were very comfortable. Having all of that space made the stay very relaxing for two colleagues to share the room while attending the convention. Everyone at the front desk was really helpful and kind.

This meant two hotels, which was not a problem. When making the decision on which HiltonHHonors property, the Hilton Suites Phoenix was the choice. The main reason for this property is the close proximity to the Metro Light rail line. The Thomas Rd. station is right by the hotel, and will take you into downtown Phoenix, to Sky Harbor, and to the east terminus point in Mesa (with stops in Tempe). I opted not to rent a car this trip and use light rail. It\u2019s dependable and very affordable ($10.50 for a three-day pass). This is definitely a business-oriented hotel! The entire hotel was not busy including the restaurant and bar. It was very, very quiet which was fine with me! A nice surprise awaited me at check-in! Apparently my name was selected as the \u201cbest guest of the day\u201d! This entitled me to a small bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese plate! Nice touch. My room was a standard two-room suite with separate living and bedroom areas. The bathroom was spacious and had the new Peter Thomas Roth amenities. I heard that Hilton had just recently switched to these products, and I found them to be quite nice. The hotel pool is located inside and overlooks the surrounding area, nothing spectacular. I was surprised to find an indoor pool in Phoenix! Adequate fitness center was located in close proximity to the pool, but I did not use it. The hotel is designed much like an Embassy Suites, with the central atrium and rooms all opening out onto it. My thoughts were, was this once an Embassy Suite reflagged a Hilton Suites? The one negative comment I have is the outrageous charge to use a computer in the business center! I travel with my iPhone (and had free Wi-Fi as a Gold) and was able to take care of email and airline check-in. You have the option of swiping a credit card for three minutes of free access and were not inclined to swipe a card for \u201cfree\u201d access. I find it very interesting that most Hampton Inn\u2019s, Hilton Garden Inn\u2019s and other HiltonHHonors properties offer free computer access in their business centers, while many Hilton\u2019s do not. As a HiltonHHonors Gold I received coupons for the breakfast buffet. Both mornings the buffet was not available and it was menu service. Luckily my coupons covered the entire cost of my breakfasts. Being a holiday weekend the hotel had very few guests, it probably didn\u2019t pay to have a buffet open. I did not use the complimentary shuttle as the Metro light rail is just a few steps from the hotel (Thomas Road stop along Central Avenue). I would highly recommend this hotel for business stays and for leisure stay also. If you don\u2019t have an automobile the light rail can get you to a host of places such as downtown Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa.

This is an all suite hotel and the suites are very spacious. The hotel is situated in between two taller office buildings and a large parking garage. So most of the rooms will face these buildings, but the rooms overlooking Thomas have a bit better view beyond immediate buildings. I stayed in rooms 621 and 321 and never heard anyone in surrounding rooms or in the hallway. There is plenty of parking in the adjacent garage. Get a ticket and bring it inside to have it validated/activated, then guests may come and go as they please. The $11/day will be charged to the room. The parking ticket may be swiped to exit the parking lot if the line for the attendant is backed up. The lobby of the hotel is large and inviting and the front desk staff is excellent. The large rooms include a leather sofa with pullout sofabed in the living area. There's a good size desk for one with wired internet (wireless also available). The internet speed isn't great, but enough to get some work done. It's $9.95/day charged to the room. The living area also has a coffee maker, small refrigerator and a sink. There's a flat panel 32\" LCD TV and an extra chair with ottoman. The living room and bedroom both have windows to the exterior. The bedroom is nice and comfortable with a GREAT mattress on the bed, two nightstands, dresser (with 32\" flat panel LCD on top) and ample lighting. There's a tall mirror as well. The bathroom is large with separate doors to the bedroom and living area. There's a single sink, regular size bathtub with shower and the closet is also in the bathroom.

I was overall quite pleased by my stay. Our room was on the third floor, not far from the elevator, and was a nice big suite consisting of a front room with large desk, sofa, armchair, and large LCD TV, a back room with two double beds and another large LCD TV, and a large bathroom that had doors onto both rooms. The beds were comfortable, and the blackout curtains did a really good job shutting out the bright Phoenix sun if we wanted to nap - or sleep in in the morning. The bathroom had a good size counter, more than enough room to spread out. The one closet in the room was in the bathroom, for some reason (including an ironing board and iron, a robe, extra blankets). The towels were good, and there was a convenient makeup mirror attached to the wall. The one thing that seemed to be missing was a hairdryer. The front room was nice to have as a great place to hang out, and for me to work on my laptop after my friend went to sleep without bothering her. There was also a small minibar area with a fridge and sink (and possibly a microwave, but I don't recall). I spent quite a lot of time in the room and one thing I noticed was that it was very quiet - the sound insulation is great. I stayed at a different hotel before where there was an open atrium area and it was LOUD - everything echoed up through the atrium into the rooms - but in this hotel, it wasn't a problem. The lobby/atrium area is this huge open area, with all the floors looking down on it, which is quite lovely, and has the Great American Grill restaurant and the Atrium Lounge located in it. The pool is in a separate room, with glass overlooking the atrium, and the small gym is located off the pool (I think you have to walk through the pool room to get to the gym). I didn't use the pool or hot tub or the gym, but I took a look around. The gym had what looked like pretty new equipment - a couple treadmills, an elliptical machine - all with their own TV screens attached, possibly a bike, some medicine balls, and one of those all-in-one weight/resistance machines. I got breakfast at the Great American Grill - it was like $12 for an open buffet type breakfast that was pretty decent, though the pancakes and french toast sticks got hard as rocks really quickly. There were plenty of other options, though - oatmeal with stuff to put in it, cereal, with 3 different kinds of milk to choose from and cut up fruit you could put on top, toast, bagels, eggs, sausages (2? kinds), bacon, potatoes, and other cookied veggies and warm options. The Hilton Suites is conveniently located very close to the Central/Thomas light rail stop, which is about a 20-30 minute ride away from the Phoenix airport (you take a shuttle from the terminal to the 44th and Washington stop), and only costs $1.75 one-way ($3.50 for an all-day pass). The light rail runs down Washington, through downtown Phoenix (right past the US Airways Center at I think the 3rd St/Jefferson or 3rd St/Washington stop), and then turns at Central, and goes up Central past the Heard Museum and the Phoenix Art Museum, to the hotel and beyond. There is parking at the hotel in the garage next door which I *think* you're supposed to pay for based on some material in the room, but which somehow we didn't get billed for. There's a small strip mall right across the street from the hotel with a Subway, Domino's Pizza, sushi place, and burger place, and then diagonally across the street there's a BBQ place and some other restaurant. A little further down Central was a Burger King, IHOP, and some other restaurants. The service was quite good - I was able to get a late checkout time of 2pm quite easily, which was nice. There was a kiosk in the lobby where you can check in to your flight and print out boarding passes. Service was a little slow at breakfast since it was a buffet/seat yourself type thing - you just need to be a bit proactive about catching the waiter's eye. I didn't like that you had to pay for internet - I think free wifi should be standard. The hotel is also a little far from the US Airways Center (though the light rail makes it easier, the last light rail runs at 11pm, which is a bit limiting for events that run late).

I did not eat there however so I can't attest to the restaurant.", "Date": "February 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cGreat Conference & Event Staff\u201d", "Author": "driverPhoenix", "ReviewID": "UR24634398", "Content": "I work nearbye and often book the Hilton for larger conferences and events.

They anticipated our every need, acted with a sense of urgency and treated us like we were the only group in the hotel. Our 2 room suites were all very nice and well-laid out, spacious and with every ammenity. I feel I need to give accolades to the staff there. Ardith, the Sales Manager and her staff; Heather, Lynn and Jon; as well as the front desk staff made this our home-away-from-home for the length of our stay.

No room service until 5PM. The drink menu on the website is not the same as the bar. The bar tender said they don't do \"fancy drinks.\" The service at the bar was also indifferent.

This wasn't our first stay (see our previous review for our Mar 2007 stay). We were attending an Eddie Izzard performance at the Orpheum Theatre and the Hilton Suites is about 2 miles from there. The check-in staff was friendly and informative. They offer shuttle service within 2 miles of the hotel but it stops at 10PM so we couldn't take advantage of it to go to the Orpheum. Parking is $11 a day. They share a parking garage with the plaza next door but the garage is very close and accessible. We preferred parking there because it was under cover and we didn't want to leave our car in the 108 degree heat. Our room was on the 11th floor. This is an all-suites hotel so each room has a separate bedroom, living room and a pass-through bathroom. There's also a desk with internet connections. We also had a wet-bar with coffeemaker and single-packet ground coffee, tea and sugar/cream packs. We had a small microwave and fridge. There wasn't a mini-bar in this room. Our room also had flat-screen TVs in both the bedroom and living room. Our king-size bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in! The sheets were clean and crisp and the bed was just the right firmness. Generally, this was one of the cleanest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in as well. The hotel restaurant is located in the center atrium. We had dinner there. Overall, they had a good selection and our pasta dishes were tasty but our garden salads look like they had been sitting inside the fridge way too long. At check-in we were also given vouchers for free breakfast buffet. That was okay. The selection was small - the hot selections included scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, french toast, pancakes and oatmeal. There was also made-to-order omelets and cereal and pastries. Very little fruit was offered though. If you aren't given free breakfast vouchers, the cost would be around $12.00 per person. The location of this hotel is near several large corporate buildings so there are quite a lot of business people staying here. During our stay, we didn't see any large groups of of kids or young people and we didn't experience any loud or boisterous parties. We would definitely stay here again if we are ever in Phoenix to attend a nearby performance.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York State", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay\u201d", "Author": "ksmith2263", "ReviewID": "UR16857378", "Content": "We had an excellent stay at the hotel.

The first week there were several schools that had booked rooms for sport teams. These were high school aged kids and they were LOUD! I was not able to work in my room and it didnt calm down until way after midnight. The second week was fine. No teenagers or sport teams and everything was wonderful. The third visit we were back and groups and I mean groups of school cheerleaders were running around. The pool showed closing hours of 10 pm however kids were still screaming and swimming at midnight. Overall the hotel is nice but most of the time is over ran with teenagers and it appears hotel staff does nothing to calm or quite the sittuation.
