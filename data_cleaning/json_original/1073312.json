Rome only has two subways running perpendicular to each other being close to the station means being close to everything else. The room was clean and the bathroom fantastic! The hotel offers breakfast tickets to a restaurant down the street. The staff were helpful, friendly and knowledgable about both tourist attractions and off the beat spots!

Hotel Dama was cheap, had a very nice,spacious and relatively clean room - and that is certainly a thing to consider. However, the problem resides on their staff... I had two friends in Rome that were looking for a last-minute reservation and, at the beginning, the owner said that it wouldn't be any problem for them to share the room with me...When my two friends arrived he started to say rude things for them about their arrival, and it tuns out he started to complain that I was disturbing the place due to my nationality...Ridiculous and offensive to say the least!", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cVery satisfied\u201d", "Author": "marketickaa", "ReviewID": "UR81760319", "Content": "Me (18), my sister (21) and our mother were staying in Rome for three nights. I guess we were very lucky to find Dama Hotel bcoz of its closeness to both Termini and the city center. It's really easy to walk to everywhere from this place (we only took subway on our way to Vatican). The hotel is on the first floor but there is an elevator. The room we stayed in wasn't very spacious though it was enough for three people. I have to emphasise that the room and bathroom were both very clean. The receptionists were nice and friendly. There are only two things I would complain about - there are markets every morning (except sunday) so it's a bit anoying - on the other hand the windows are quite sound-proof so if you close the window it's ok. Also these markets are almost everywhere in Rome center. The next thing is breakfast. One little coffee and croissante is not enough. Not for me. We found out that such breakfasts are in most of the hotels in Rome so it's not a reason for not staying in Dama Hotel. :) Last thing I would like to say is a recomandation: if you stay in Dama Hotel you should have a dinner in the Ristorante Mino - it's in the same street, 2 min walking. They cook really well, they got excellente house wine (we had white), the service and waitreses are very nice and polite and the prices are not high.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turku, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money!!!\u201d", "Author": "Fintraveller65", "ReviewID": "UR68801970", "Content": "Excellent room, nice staff, nice to get breakfast in a nearby cafe, recently renowated rooms, free internet( problems thought, but a computer to use in the\"lobby\") Spacious, kids loved the nice guys in reception!", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNice owner, but bait and switch...\u201d", "Author": "K-ZOregon", "ReviewID": "UR41580915", "Content": "The owner of the Hotel Dama was very friendly and very helpful.

Once you ring the bell the booking manager comes to you and takes to you to your room. He was very kind and helpful and arranged for our taxi the next AM to the airport. We than had to walk around the block to our rooms. We had help from Damus, another employee. Especially since we were on the 3 floor and no lift. He also left us his cell phone number and told us to call if we needed anything. We got a coupon to get breakfast the next AM and off we went. The triple room was tight but clean! The bathroom is clean and new as well. For one night it was just perfect. Small and clean and basic. There was a small TV in the room, no phone but we had a nice size window and an air ventilator. I wanted a place that was clean and safe for one night at a good price and that is what we got.
