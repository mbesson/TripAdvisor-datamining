The location is very central and we didnt have to use public transport once - we also felt extremely safe walking around at night.

The well equipped small kitchenette, safe, big closet and two small balconies were very helpful. Even though smoking was allowed in our room, there was no cigarette smell at all. The hotel is located very close to Plaza de Santa Ana, Plaza del Angel and Calle Huertas and, within walking distance to Puerta del Sol and Gran Via. The hotel has free wi-fi and at the lobby there is a coffee machine. I disagree with some of the reviews that affirm that it gets noisy at night.

On the first night I stayed in room 402, it was huge, but it was much smaller in 403. It was basically quiet. I didn't find it noisy at all during my stay maybe because I was on the fourth floor. All the sights are within walking distance. Remember to go to Museo del Prado from 1800 to 2000 (every day) and save yourself 12 euros each for the admission. There were lots of people going there during the free admission hours but still I still managed to get in within 10 minutes. Lunch at Plaza del Mayor is just around 10-15 euros per person. And it is just a 15-minute walk from the hotel. The suckling pig dish in Botin Restaurant near the Plaza del Mayor is excellent. It is crunchy on the outside and juicy inside. It costs about 22 euros per portion (around 1/4 of the pig - good for 1 person but they can cut it into two pieces if you share). The sangria there is also great and tastes unique but is quite strong. Remember to make a reservation before you go because it is always full. Reservation can be made online through their website.

The location is great for all the bars and restaurants in the Santa Ana and Puerta del Sol areas of the city. No kitchen anymore in the suite which is no loss given the reviews I had previously read about the small size of the kitchen. Anyway there are plenty places to eat close by.

It was booked by some friends from the US on an academic trip with their daughter. Their room was a triple, but about the same size as mine. Their one criterion for choosing a hotel was that it have a wireless network, and they were assured that Suite Prado did have one. But in fact, they were just installing it, and it would be working \"soon, maybe next week.\" Oh, well. My room was big, and clean, though the furniture was worn. The bathroom was clean if smallish. There was some light from the windows (3rd floor). The kitchen was a surprise, but I used only the fridge for my manchego and chorizo purchases. It was supremely noisy. For some reason this did not bother me too much. Maybe the afternoon naps and then the heavy drinking and eating till 1am made me tolerant, but the noise really did continue at top pitch until 4am or so. There is some kind of sex-themed restaurant on the adjacent street, and you can imagine the crowds that that drew! Speaking of restaurants, the Argentinian steak place was great, but you need to reserve. The staff were friendly enough and spoke English ok. The location can't be beat in terms of museums and tapas-gorging.", "Date": "May 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "san antonio", "Title": "\u201cbad experience!\u201d", "Author": "susanwhite", "ReviewID": "UR4160480", "Content": "Just returned from a long awaited trip to Spain in early Nov. Had reservations for 8 nights at Suites Prado, but ended up only staying 1 night! We reserved a non-smoking suite, which the hotel supposedly offers, but all upholstery and the bed absolutely reeked of smoke.Staff claimed they had no control over this problem, even though there were ashtrays scattered throughout this \"non-smoking\" suite. We wanted a kitchen mainly for breakfast, but the kitchen was completely bare of essentials, which they will furnish only for extended stays. There is no table and chairs, only a desk with 1 chair! We did move to another suite, but were still unhappy, as all bathrooms, while well appointed, are extremely small. This property is advertised as 4 star, but we did not consider it above 3 star at best. However, all rooms were scrupulously clean, and the location is good. If you really want to cook, there do not to seem to be any good stores nearby. Beware of making reservations if you are not sure, because they will definitely charge you if you do not cancel ahead of time! We left with our luggage, not knowing where we were going to stay - a very bad feeling! However, we have learned to have back-up information. Ended up staying at the Liabeny, a wonderful 4 1/2 to 5 star property, which we would highly recomend for cleanliness, comfort, and service. Also excellent location.

The \"Suite\" was smaller than a Motel 6, the carpets and curtains were filthy. The bathroom was so small, you had to step OVER the toilet to get in and out of the shower. The staff was helpful, but if you do not know conversational Spanish you may have some trouble. There is only one person on staff at any given time and the skill level of their English is hit or miss.
