The towels were brown and dingy. The paint was peeling from the shower and the bottom of the shower looked like someone had walked around in it with dirty shoes. It also had a constant leak. The water pressure was nice but it literally took 10 minutes for the warm water to start. There were alot of guests that stayed there fulltime because as we were waiting for the shuttle to Disney there were kids getting on the school bus. Sketchy guys always standing out front trying to bum cigarettes. No internet besides the computer down stairs that charges 25 cents a minute. No breakfast. Positives were that it was quiet at night (which is probably because noone was staying there) and the shuttle to and from Disney was always on time. BUT there is only a couple of times to choose from. It leaves at 8am in the morning and you can return to your hotel at either 7:45 or 10:30pm. Oh and when we got there we had to switch rooms because the first rooms front door did not lock when we left. We decided to keep our \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door because everything seemed shady. Did not want the maids coming in the room with our stuff. Wasps nests on the balcony too so we could not go out there. BEWARE of this hotel!!!", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Bay, FL", "Title": "\u201cAwful\u201d", "Author": "321AreaFemale", "ReviewID": "UR117255672", "Content": "I'm at this place right now and the internet keeps going in and out and it just wont stay on. Horrible connection. \"High Speed Internet\" it is NOT. There are ants and bugs from time to time, those little ghost ants and I'm now afraid of what's going to crawl on me when I go to sleep. The rugs seem clean but they're brown and hard to see anything crawling on it. There's a balcony about 12\" wide. The lock on it is loose. The hot water is SCALDING. Front desk is as helpful as they can be but have no idea what satellite system is providing tv programming. Cost of room is $39.95 but if you want a refrigerator and microwave, add another $10 per night. I was going to stay 2 nights but I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm sure there's much better out there for this price.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livonia, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cI really liked your hotel and I'll be back\u201d", "Author": "Davez_11", "ReviewID": "UR110846647", "Content": "I liked everything, except the noise from the Tiki Bar late at night.

We stayed here after leaving disney as a cheap alternative big mistake. This place was gross. The rooms were old, smelly paint peeling, if one person got out of the bed it would dump the other person out of bed. It sits next door to a deserted hotel. They rent rooms by the week to people of questionable intention. We were too tired to look for somewhere else or would have.

We booked through priceline and upon arrival we were told that they were overbooked and moved us to the other Americas best value inn on Irlo Bronson Hwy. We said fine and went to the other hotel, when we arrived there they did not have any idea what was going on. They could not honor our priceline reservations that were already paid for. they told us the other hotel was going out of business and turning people away and sending them to this hotel, there were several other families there with us complaining and trying to get a room. Eventually we got priceline to issue a refund to our credit card that will take 5 to 10 days to post and we paid to stay at this hotel. Other families that booked through Orbitz were not issued refunds... This could have really ruined our trip if we were on a stricter budget!! Please be careful to only book the Americas Best Value on at 7514 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy. The Americas Best Value in at 4643 W Irlo Bronson Mem Hwy is the one that is closing and trying to scam people out of money.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cCrap Service Careless Staff\u201d", "Author": "montcomd27", "ReviewID": "UR23248640", "Content": "I stayed here for a business trip and got zero room service unless I asked for it physically.
