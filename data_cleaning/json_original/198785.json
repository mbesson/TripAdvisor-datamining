Harry's Bar is an overpriced 'institution' across the street, which is packed each night. My room was on the 3rd floor. There was some kitchen noise from breakfast each morning, as I had my window open. The mini fridge is in the closet..and created a lot of heat, so I found my room warm. The bed was pretty hard..but I found that to be the case in almost every place I stayed in Italy. The bathroom was massive! Huge tub, nice sink, big mirror and heated towel rack. I actually think the bathroom was bigger than the part of the room that had the bed, TV, and desk! Breakfast is a great experience.. buffet style. Eggs, pastries, meats, fruit and yogurt.

San Marco is practically at the doorstep as are all the high-end boutiques like Prada, Bottega, etc. The vaporetto stop is also at your doorstep. We arrived by water taxi from the airport and literally disembarked onto the hotel patio, at which you can take breakfast. The rest of the hotel, however, is just OK only...nothing fantastic. The standard room was a comfortable enough size, and the bathroom was nice and spacious. However I didn't like that the room was carpeted, and the carpet looked and felt like it had not been cleaned in a long long time! It felt grimy under my feet and the hotel didn't provide any bedroom slippers, so that was pretty gross. I also didn't like that they have no irons and ironing boards in the rooms - you need to pay to have your clothes pressed. So business travelers, take note. The service was mixed - some really friendly and responsive staff, but also some indifferent ones. Asked the concierge to recommend a nice restaurant for dinner. He made a reservation at one, and gave us directions. When we arrived, the restaurant looked like a real tourist trap and the proprietor insisted on seating us at a stuffy corner far inside when all the al fresco tables were still unoccupied (we were really early for dinner!). It being the height of summer, we declined and decided to go to another restaurant just around the corner - far friendlier service and had a nice buzzy crowd, and we got a table outside so we could watch Venice go by. So I wouldn't recommend relying on the hotel concierge for dining recommendations - do your own research on good places to eat, and get the guy at the concierge to make reservations for you, but NOT recommend you a restaurant!", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bromley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cProbably the best location in Venice!\u201d", "Author": "jane_hayes", "ReviewID": "UR127312287", "Content": "Had a great 4 night stay at this lovely hotel, a former palace recently refurbished cleverly combining both traditional and contemporary styles.

(I say \"unexpected\" because my room and my brother's room were reserved at Monaco's sister hotel, the less expensive Palazzo Selvadego, while my parents room was reserved at the Monaco.) Upon arrival at the Hotel's private dock, we were immediately greeted by a concierge and porter who assisted us into the large lobby with our considerable amount of luggae. The desk clerk greeted us cordially and then advised me that he had amended our reservation so that all three rooms were now in the Hotel Monaco. It was a wonderful surprise and really got the trip off to a great start. Additionally, although I booked a \"single,\" my room was spacious double with an enormous bathroom. From what I could tell after visiting my parents and brother/sister-in-law's rooms - all of the bathrooms were large and well appointed. The concierge (I wish I could remember his name!) took the time to orient us to the city and point out the main sites on a map, which was very helpful. He also explained that the Hotel, in conjunction with a glass factory on Murano, offers a free water taxi to and from Murano every half hour. We took advantage of that and received and amazing trip across the lagoon and around the island to Murano. Some other reviewers found the breakfast to be inadequate, but I found it to be quite the opposite. The complimentary breakfast is served on the beautiful terrace overlooking the lagoon. We arrived to find a beautifully set table with silver coffee pots and three silver baskets brimming with croissants, sweet rolls, and muffins. There was also a selection of jellies and butter to compliment the pastries. The coffee was endless and the staff friendly. It was lovely to munch on pastries while watching the boats pass as the sun glinted off the water. I would also like to comment on prior reviews which noted that the staff was aloof or snooty. We did not find that to be the case at all. Except for one night concierge, we found the entire staff (reception, concierge, waters, housekeeping) to be efficient and friendly. All requests were addressed quickly and with a smile. The rooms were cleaned in the mornings and tidied again when the beds were turned down. As all previous reviewers have noted, the location is sensational. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend the Hotel Monaco and Grand Canal to anyone visiting Venice.

We also liked the fact that there was a free safe in the room which does help as it meant we did not to have walk around Venice with all our valuables. There was a mini bar which as you would expect was pretty expensive.

Breakfast as described by others was not at all exciting but what you come to expect from some european cities. There is an al a carte menu which you had to pay for and we did think that the small boxes of cereal and fruit should have been part of the normal breakfast also with the opportunity to get more than one small glass of juice if required. As with most Italian cities church bells are a problem and this hotel is situated so close to St Marks Square that you will not be able to avoid them. If you get a room which runs alongside the alleyway you can also here noise from people which in the summer with windows open could keep you awake. Do what we did and bring yourself some earplugs and this certainly was not a problem. The hotel is situated right on the grand canal and is perfect as it is right next to a Vaporetto stop and also gondolas and the Alilaguna which takes you to the airport. We found the public transport and attractions very reasonably priced, however the cost of food was pretty expensive. January is a great time to go if you want to avoid crowds and we managed to see so much without having to queue for anything. One thing we would point out is that many restaurants are closed until February as it appeared this was a break for most people after Christmas.

The Palazzo Salvadego's room size and proximity to St Mark's Square (just a few yards, and we thought the main hotel location was close!) are excellent. From this visit, though, we prefer the main hotel, mainly because breakfast can be served in your room on a beautifully-laid table/large trolley and we found the restaurant breakfast service very chaotic on 3 of the 4 mornings of our stay. On the first morning we were overlooked on arrival, then a further delay taking our \"extras\" orders (simple scrambled egg and boiled egg), then our orders arrived separately with a long gap between them. On the second & third mornings we gave up trying to order extra items as the service was so slow and chaotic! On our last morning, though, the weather was great and we sat on the terrace by the Grand Canal (wonderful!) and received very good service. We've always found the evening restaurant service, food and wine excellent. The hotel's seafood risotto is to die for and, when we've decided to forego the dessert course, the restaurant staff have placed a couple of \"taster\" desserts on the table for us to try anyway! The reception staff are very professional and the concierge staff have always been very helpful (unlike other Venice hotels we've stayed in!).

Felt very inpersonal and business like, and although on first impression it looks opulent it is very uncomfortable. Only one hard chair in the bedroom which was very cramped, and the lounge bar very cold and uncomfortable, not to mention expensive! Forty five euros for two cups of tea and a toasted cheese and ham sandwhich made with cheap square ham out of a packet. As for the complimentary breakfast, a croisant and some stale bun thingy (anything else you paid a very high price for, and even then there wasn't much choice), it was a joke! the only good thing being a nice view of the canel while you ate it! They try to push the restaurant, the menu looked grand but after the breakfast and bar experience we didn't want to risk it as the prices were very high. However to their credit they provided a very classy and useful umbrella in the room for our use during our stay! Check in and check out was very efficient but then I would not expect less. This could be a beautiful hotel due to its position, but unfortunately I feel they are cashing in on this to the detriment of thier guests.

My hubby and I stayed two nights, and the couple we traveled with only one. Let me tell you, I wish we'd stayed another night. Our first glitch came when trying to make a reservation for a single night on a weekend in off season. We were told by half a dozen hotels that they don't rent rooms for less then 2 nights! No one could really explain why. In english. So we decided on this hotel because of location and booked two rooms for two nights, and our friends had to eat the difference. We paid 210 euro per night for a standard double and 240 euro for a superior double. The intention was that we would pay and stay in the superior, since we were staying two nights. I asked and canal front rooms were going for 675 euro a night, so we knew there would be no view. When you arrive at the airport, you have several options to get to the hotel...the one with the least effort is to take a water taxi (about 95 euro up to 8 people or 6 people with luggage) because all your luggage will be handled for you and they drop you off into the side door of the hotel...the least expensive with moderate effort is to take the Alilaguna Airport shuttle (for 12 euro pp) which involves rolling your luggage down a long walkway to the dock and putting it on the boat (there's no line, push your way forward or you won't get on), with help then unloading luggage with help at the Alilaguna pier which is about a block and half from the hotel and over a single small bridge. You could also take the Alilaguna to a stop prior to St Marks and switch over to the Vaparetto which would drop off immediately in front of the hotel. This would add the cost of the Vaporetto (suggest getting a card before leaving the airport), the unloading and loading of luggage only partially assisted twice, and unknown amount of walking between piers which are usually within a block of each other. Confused yet? We did the Alilaguna and dragged a block and a half. If you're tired after the red-eye, or in any way disabled, splurge on the water taxi. On arrival, i found that the language/cultural barrier had caused issues already. Apparently a 'double' may mean two separate beds and a single would be one bed, even tho it could fit two. Who knew? Not me! Check that out however, because the rates for single rooms are much cheaper. So, the woman at the front desk changed that and asked which room we would like, and my husband made a joke abut 'the one with the best view'...which I followed very quickly with \"the superior\". Well, either she didn't hear me or was already over us, because when we were taken to our room, it was TINY. But, it was nice, with a marble bathroom, and knowing they use special angles on pictures to make them look larger, I figured it was on par. Now, let me say, the bathroom was amazing. Entirely marble with a deep soaking tub...which i guarantee you will fall asleep in at the end of the day. The decor was lovely. It had a minibar with the normal exhorbitant prices (see pics for exact prices), a safe, robes, a bidet and hairdryer in the bathroom, and a flat screen TV. THE BEDS ARE HARD AS ROCKS THO. And the pillows are little slips of nothing. Also, be sure to GET TWO ROOM KEYS because if one of you is in the bath at night, and the other decides to go out for something, a room key had to be in the wall slot or ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT and it's so dark you cannot even hope to get out. Ya, that was interesting... The concierge staff was most helpful with handing out maps and suggesting must-sees. When you go out the front door which opens onto the Calle Vallaressa, take a left (away from the water) and the next door will be a bank with an ATM! Very convenient! At the end of the street, after walking by every high-end shop in Venice, is a shop that sells the best Gelato...don't leave without one! Take a right there and you'll see the arch of the back end of St Marks square...less than 100 yards, under those arches and you're there! I highly recommend going before 8 AM when you'll be virtually alone and able to take pictures unempeded by thousands of humans which will fill the place by noon. The hotel is perfectly located to walk to or take a Vaparetto to everything in Venice! DO NOT MISS THE FRARI CHURCH, AND GO INSIDE ST MARKS AND THE DOGES PALACE. You will not regret it!! So, our friends arrived while we on Murano the next day. We took the hotel shuttle over and spent about an hour watching the demo and looking at room after room of amazing glass. In the end we couldn't find anything we wanted, said 'No thanks' and were set free. The great thing is that the glass factory they take you to is down the street where the prices are better. Got glass adorned wine bottle stoppers for 10 euro each, way less then the 22 euros at the Rialto Bridge and St Marks square. Do plan to take the Vaparetto back from Murano. Getting you back to your hotel isn't a priority, even if they told you the boats ran every 30 minutes. It took over an hour for one to finally take us back. And with what we gave the guy in tip, we could have paid for the Vaparetto! Our friends ate lunch in the restaurant waiting for us. They said it was great. It was also 66 euro for two entrees and drinks! However, they raved about their room. Said it was the nicest they'd ever stayed in in Europe! So we went to see it. Well no wonder! It was the superior we had paid for!! It was practically a suite! Still no view, just down the hall from us, but very spacious. We didn't say anything since they paid for two nights, they really should have gotten a great room for 420 euro, ya know? As for the winding corridors, the hotel is several buildings that have been joined together. It is mostly euro-chic decor until you get into the room which has a little venetian touch to it. The pics of the room with the friezes on the ceiling is the upstairs ballroom. Breakfast is indeed a few croissants and muffins with tea or coffee and anything else is extra. If you're used to a full breakfast, you'll pay for it. But, if you can wait and pick things up on the way or be okay with finding a restaurant on the fly, it's so much better anyway. Checkout was a breeze. Bellman came within 5 minutes, but we had told them our checkout time the day before, so no surprise there. We had also requested a water taxi the day before at noon, and it was right on time. It took us directly to the port, not up the grand canal tho, and we never touched our bags. All in all, the hotel was sufficient for our needs, clean, most of the staff (all the male staff really) were friendly and helpful, the location was amazing, and while pricey, i would completely stay here again.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "jilllovescricket", "ReviewID": "UR21909004", "Content": "My husband & I stayed at this delightful hotel for two nights prior to joining a cruise.

I didn't ask if they have 'net access in the rooms because I didn't have my computer with me. I stayed there because it was a last minute weekend trip I did solo and I wanted to stay somewhere central and nice and safe (and the Bauer was booked). Next time though, I won't mind staying in the outskirts of Venice. Such an awesome little city. I will definitely go back for longer. I'd stay at the Hotel Monaco again if someone else pays for it.

The location could not be any better. Getting to the hotel is easy - either by the bus boat from the airport (the boat stop is a 30 second walk from the hotel!) or private boat transfer which takes you directly to the hotel's entrance. You are literally 2 minutes walk to St Mark's Square and about 20 mins stroll to Rialto Bridge. The rooms are small but beautiful with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and full marble bathrooms. We typically like quite contemporary decor and this hotel manages to mix traditional and modern decor beautifully. The room service was the best I have ever experienced - fresh towels and cleaning is done morning and afternoon / evening - they seem to anticipate / look out for when you leave and swiftly come in and clean. The turn down service on a night is great - there were even little cloths placed by the side of your bed for stepping onto (never seen that before!). Regarding the service - admittedly some of the staff can be a little frosty but generally we found them all very pleasant. I honestly think that the Italians are very blunt and direct and if you appreciate that this is more of a culture difference than a personal issue then you won't have any complaints! You won't get a big fake smile like you would in USA. I saw the earlier review about being ignored at the restaurant - you need to book in advance to get into the restaurant as it is really popular and gets really busy! We booked a day in advance and even then there was only 1 table at 9.30pm available! The food is great, but it has a big price tag to match, but well worth the experience! Dining on the terrace on an evening is so romantic, not to be missed! Breakfast was a basket of croissants, rolls and jams, with tea / coffee & orange juice. If you want something more substantial, omlettes or bacon and eggs is about 8 euros which is not all that much really! Especially since you are in Venice and EVERYTHING in Venice is really expensive! Get used to paying top prices or it will end up annoying you! The reception and conceirge staff were briliant with us during our stay. We also had a complimentary bottle of champagne (hmmm well OK probably local sparkling wine!) delivered to our room on the first night of our stay as they knew it was our anniversary! There's also a Gondola stop outside the hotel which is very handy! We booked online directly with the hotel about 6 months in advance and paid roughly \u00c2\u00a3160 for the room per night, including breakfast. Given that this is Venice I think this was very reasonable for an amazing 4* hotel. You will find it hard to beat the price, location and quality of this place.

Fortunately, the double glazing really did its job, and there was not a lot of noise, even though it was a major pick-up area for organized gondala rides and water taxis. Our room had two twin beds (pushed together, but not made up as a king) a desk and chair, a small settee and coffee table, and a sort of a room divider with a small flat-screen TV monitor on it. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, with real hangers, instead of the theft-proof kind. The marble bathroom was very nice, with double sinks, a huge tub and shower, heated towel rack, bidet, and lots of wonderful fluffy towels. Room service was amazing. We called for our coffee first thing every morning, and it came within five minutes. Turn-down service was lovely, and it was wonderful to come back at the end of the day to a beautifully made-up room.

If you get a chance make sure you have a gondola ride bit expensive but hey you cant go to venice without the experience. The staff were friendly and we had a small problem with the shower tap, once reported to the desk it was repaired immediately. In all the hotel made our trip to Venice so special.

First of all, the location is excellent. The rooms are very nice, although our friends got a room the same time we did and theirs was a little nicer than ours, but ours had the better view so we couldn't complain. We got the standard, non-canal view room, but our room looked out onto the street that enters St. Mark's Square so we were able to people watch. Our friends paid the same we did but their room had the view of the building that others complained about. However, they also had a huge tub while our room only had a shower. After having stayed in a lot of very noisy hotels in Europe, I was also pleased that this hotel was relatively quiet. Even in our room by the square, as long as we ran the air conditioning we could not hear outdoor noise. The breakfast that's included in the price was the typical continental fare, but it comes with the best cappucino you have ever had, and my husband and I usually paid a little extra for some eggs or fruit.

We were originally going with my wife, but she could not make it at the last minute due to her pregnancy. To start with: It is impossible to get a Canal View room by booking on-line, no matter if discounted or paying full price. There is obviously a typical Euoropean \"hidden inside track\" that you need to follow to get one. No manner of offer of upgrade, increased payment, or bribe would allow us to get one once there or prior to arriving. Also, as with many places in Europe, they loath the idea of 3 people in a room, children or not, even if you pay more or offer to upgrade to a suite. We ended up paying 575 E, ($750.00) for a small suite that faced a brick wall. The staff was polite but cold and had a slight 'tude. towards Americans, especially with children. And this is with a well-traveled first-class bunch, not a screaming hoard with Mickey Mouse hats, either. The room was very nice, but the sheets hard and the minibar antiquated. I must say that the room service and maids were on the ball. All in all, we were a bit disappointed. I went there specifically to get a canal view room and save a dollar or 2.

One word of caution, no irons in the room, if you need something ironed you have to use their pressing service, which is very expensive (as if paying $500 per night isn't, but somehow that seemed worth it, $40 to iron 4 pieces of clothing did not seem worth it) lesson learned, don't leave the US without a small travel steamer. I did a lot of research on various hotels and the last thing I wanted to do was to wander around the small streets of Venice lost pulling my luggage. This hotel's location can not be beat.

The only rooms offered on the hotel's website, and Expedia's, were Standard and Superior. The cost of the superior room was almost double the cost of a standard and I assumed that you'd get a nicer room with a canal view. When I arrived at the hotel, they showed me to a room which was small and had no view. I complained. The porter didn't speak much English and put my on a mobile phone to the receptionist. They showed me a second room. Exactly the same. A third room. Exactly the same. I asked to see a Standard room. Absolutely no difference whatsoever. I said that I wanted a canal view. The receptionist told me that they do not give Canal View rooms to Expedia customers, and that none of the Superior rooms have canal views. Eventually, after about 45 minutes of complaining, they managed to find a Superior room with a canal view (I'm guessing they had just finished building the room as they were adamant they didn't exist before). But, lesson one if you're planning to go here, don't bother with a superior room. Lesson Two is don't bother with breakfast. The \"continental breakfast\" is a bowl of dried up bread, a couple of muffins and a single croissant with some jam. If you want juice it's 5 Euros for a small glass. An omelette is 8 Euros. Yoghurt is no less than 3 Euros for one of those little tiny pots you get in 6 packs. The General Manager told me that they will be changing to a buffet breakfast in April as a lot of guests had complained that they were being ripped off.
