We arrived around 2pm to the hotel and waited in the lobby approximately 3 hours for a room (while waiting we weren't offered drinks or any kind of attention). The room that was being prepared for us is on the 7th floor. While waiting we were the ones who had to follow up with the reception! Not to mention that 2 girls arrived after us and sat next to us waiting for a room as well. They were young russians. They came after us and took a room before us. One of the girls went to the receptionist (short guy with well combed hair) and they started smiling and talking until she came back with a key calling her friend to join her. After that scene, we went again to argue with the receptionist, he made us wait an additional half an hour and then gave us a corner room on the 11th floor inistead of the one on the 7th floor stating that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel (Corner rooms are half size normal rooms - we know that because we saw our friends room which we met in Istanbul by surprise). My guess the room on the 7th which was supposed to be ours was given to the russians instead. That said, the receptionist was not only a liar but rude as well. Added to all the above, we booked a 5 night stay with Marmara Taksim Hotel INCLUDING breakfast via expedia. Despite that statement clear on the vouchers, the receptionist and the manager (via phone call) insisted that breakfast was not to be offered because it wasn't showing in their system. We argued again for nothing, again waste of time and manners. We ended up paying breakfast 2 times!! (20 Euros per person = 200 Euros for the whole trip). The Marmara Taksim Hotel was lucky because the package that i booked via expedia was non-refundable or else i would have simply left the hotel and booked another one. As for breakfast (which is a bit poor), we are supposed to be present before 10am (or 11am, pardon me for not remembering), but when that hour comes, they remove all the food on the buffet!! even while people are still having breakfast. We travel a lot and seeing that shocked us. We never saw that one coming. They are supposed to not let anyone come in the restaurant for breakfast and not remove the food!! were they saving food for the next day? Well no idea. Only good thing about the hotel is the location..", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cKeep far away\u201d", "Author": "marky1976", "ReviewID": "UR85150168", "Content": "This hotel is a very good location but what a waste of money.

The hotel is not something special and it needs rennovation; actually one of the guys working in the reception told us that some floors are under rennovation so after that i guess it will be even more worthy to stay there. Yes, the location is just perfect; you go out and you have in front of you Istiklal Str. Any time of the day and night you need to buy something it's just outside the entrance; our room was on the 6th floor looking at the Bosphorous which was also very nice view. BUT; the room's furniture was very old. We wanted double bed and they gave us 2 single beds that we had to unite. The furniture were corrupted and they absolutely need change. The good thing was the television that had many international and local channels and the perfect wireless Internet connection. The room was not very clean; the previous customer had forgotten its Burger King papers bags and they were there, and when we moved the 2 single beds to unite them, there were some smashed biscuits under the beds; also the view was perfect but the window was not cleaned for long time and you couldn't enjoy the view. Other than that our room was very silent, which is a rare thing for that neighbourhood; i guess a room overlooking the main road would be very noisy. The breakfast was not satisfying at all; we just ate the first day and we didn't eat again because we didn't like the quality.

I arrived to a cool reception and that was about all the service that was supplied over the four days that I stayed there. Previously I had stayed at the great Dersaadet Hotel on the southern side of the Golden Horn and the difference between the two hotels could not have been greater. Being right on Taksim Square is certainly advantageous and the views, if you are on the upper floors, are good. However, on my return from a tour about ten days later I had a room on the opposite side to my original room, down low, and I had a spectacular view of the Air Conditioning plant (as AC plants go, I've seen better). The Taksim Square was clean and tidy I admit but it was also rather noisy as well. I was awoken quite often by noise coming up from the Square in the early hours.

We said we would not accept that and were told at the reception desk our room would be changed in the morning. However, the next morning, with a change of staff, we were told we could not change rooms as the hotel was fully booked. Strangely enough we overheard a Turkish man complaining about his room booking and he wanted to change two rooms, which they seemed to take care of. When we asked yet again to have ours changed, they shrugged their shoulders and said there was nothing they could do. We had asked to see the manager twice, but apparently he was always out on the street somewhere. At that point I said we would check out and wanted a refund. They took no notice. I believe they thought we were bluffing. Still at the reception desk I phoned the Turkish agency that made the booking - a very helpful company. They heard me talking to the agent and, hey presto, seconds into my phone conversation they came up with a double room. The next fiasco was over an extra pillow. I phoned twice to housekeeping, but they never answered the phone. We asked twice at the front desk and were assured that a pillow would be delivered to our room. It never appeared. When we came in at the end of the night and asked the night reception staff for a pillow, the man shouted and hurled abuse saying that we should have asked for one earlier. Talk about the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing! We were then told there were no spare pillows as the hotel was full. What a load of nonsense! Yet another miracle - a pillow was found and reluctantly brought to our room, but not without a screaming match to get one. The last night we were there we bought a bottle of water and a bottle of coke to take back to our room. We were stopped by the same rude night desk staff member and told we could not bring them into the hotel. I have never heard of any such thing, regardless of how much any hotel might want to sell their minibar drinks. He was adamant and said that if we did not leave them in the reception he would call the police! We thought he was off his head. We did take the drinks back to our room and no police arrived. We went to see the manager about the situation the next day but he was still absent (or so they said). We have travelled around the world and stayed in 2* hotels up to 5* hotels, mainly the latter. We have never been treated so appallingly by anyone or any hotel in the world. A word of warning - If any of you decide you will stay at this hotel, make sure you have a room at the back of the hotel, overlooking the Bosphoros. The front overlooks the main square and is incredibly noisy - the call to prayer from the mosque across the street and the constant loudspeakers of the police right through the night could drive you crackers. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

You are expected to buy the very expensive water from the minibar, which is $4 a bottle; water at the markets on the street cost 30 cents. Some other guests told us they even had staff at the hotel confiscate the water and pieces of chocolate they were bringing to their rooms---although they were told they would be returned to them as they were leaving! We had another problem when we forgot to remove our Do Not Disturb sign from our door as we left one day, and the room was not made up. When we called down and asked if we could at least get some clean towels, we were told that it was impossible, as housekeeping closed at 5 p.m., and they didn't have a key!
