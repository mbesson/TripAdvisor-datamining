The bad news is also that the hotel is immediately adjacent to the water bust stop, and the canopy will partially obscure the lagoon view from some rooms. Breakfasts were excellent, and when I was there with my family the staff was indeed making cappuccinos and espressos with the fancy machine in the dining hall.

This time I pushed the boat out and booked the junior suite at the front of the hotel so we could enjoy the views. I also pre-booked some flowers for the room. It was only a three night stay so I sort restaurant suggestions from the hotel before arriving and they were very helpful with suggestions which I could then research before arrival. Why return? 1. Location. A)Virtually all the water buses pass through the Lido making it easy to get to any where in Venice and the neighboring islands. I thought it would be a good idea to take the line 5 road bus to Venice and then get the local waterbus to the Lido but that was not a good plan. Take the waterbus from the airport to the Lido (1hr) as it is much more relaxing and easier to do. No dragging cases over bridges. I paid the extra to return to the airport by waterbus. B)The view from the front of the hotel is wonderful. OK the new water bus station can creep into some camera shots from the 1st floor but morning, noon and night looking across to St Marks square is a real treat. I even managed to get our chair on to the veranda to sit in the sun and watch the world go by and read my book. C) You don't get knocked down by herds of tourists as you step out of the hotel, but mind the road traffic which is present on the Lido. 2. The staff. Having already been in discussion about our needs we had a warm welcome from the staff who were pleased to make our restaurant reservation for the following night. Cases taken to the room where the pre-ordered flowers were ready and looked lovely, plus two glasses of fizzy wine and a snack. The day of the big meal did not go well as my wife suffered from a migraine for most of the day. No problem the staff cancelled the restaurant reservation. The next day with the wife feeling better after breakfast we took advantage with another couple of being taken by private taxi boat for free which the hotel arranges to a glass works on Murano. We went on by bus to Burano. On return we asked the staff to make a reservation again with the restaurant and they obviously passed on details of our anniversary as we were surprised by 3 singing waiters and a cake with candles after our main course. When I wanted to use the internet to check in for our flight and reserve seats they kindly let me use the office pc so I could print off the boarding passes although they do have a customer pc for web access. 3. The hotel has a majestic decor inside whilst appearing well kept outside. The junior suite with 2 small verandas to get the most of those views has two large wash basins, a jacuzzi bath (used twice a day, plenty of hot water, go easy on the bubble bath!), toilet and bidet, shower cubicle and fresh towels each day. The bed was comfortable and extra pillows were made available. No tea making facilities but minibar at not too unreasonable prices in room along with safe with key.The rooms are tastefully decorated in Venicean style, clean and tidy and well kept. We forgot to use the shutters until the last night to keep the sun out. Up to date small tv with good picture and lots of Italian programs and MTV. Breakfast room is very nice, some may find the choice of breakfast items limited (no hot food) but there is plenty there to see you through to lunch. No lunch or dinner at the hotel but excellent Pizzeria to the right and 5+ other restaurants of varying price within 100m. Expect to pay EUR50 for two people at most places though. Our celebration meal topped EUR150 but was excellent. If you find anything wrong while staying there simply ask the staff politely to investigate and correct it. Yes we hope to go back again but we will make sure it is for at least 4 nights not 3.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "derbyshire", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent views\u201d", "Author": "borrowedtheboots", "ReviewID": "UR125498612", "Content": "A front room at this hotel gives splendid views across the lagoon towards St Marco and the whole of Venice.

No one wants to have troubles when traveling, right? But, unfortunately, this happens, and when it happens all you want is to be among friends. That's what you are going to find in this incredible hotel. Because of the enormous cold Italy has faced these days our car has been freezed and stopped working just when we were leaving the hotel. Trouble hum? Not at all! We just had to sit down, relax and let the Eugenio, the front desk gentleman handle all the trouble. (including contact Sixt (rent-a-car), local mechanics, etc.). This is the most friendship treatment I've ever received in all hotels I've been. Fantastic! Now about the hotel: Location: The hotel is not located in Venice itself, Lido is an island in front of Venice (about 1 mile away). In my personal opinion, I would not stay in Venice because most of hotels are located in places without car access, and as I travel with a lot of luggages, it will not be easy to carry it in that tiny aisles of Venice. Besides that, Lido is a more modern-city-like island than Venice, then again, another personal taste. Just in front of the hotel (10 meters) there are boats to Venice every 10-20 minutes, 24hs a day, 7 days a week, all the year. When I say boats, this is more like buses, very comfortable seats and, as there are no waves in this area, very stable -- even for me that have dizziness issues I had no problems. The ticket is 6.5 euros per person, one way, kids don't pay. Surrounding the hotel there are bakerys, restaurants, bars and coffee-shopps. Infrastructure: This is an old building from the outside view, but from the inside this is a quite fancy one. All the floors covered with marbles, beautiful view of the beach and Venice from the breakfast room, comfortable and cozy rooms with very well equipped restroom. Our room didn't have bathtub, but we were told this is possible to book it (if this is done with time) for the same price. The breakfast is light, does not include hot plates, which made no difference for myself. Pros: Friendship (Nicest staff in Italy), good rooms, calm, quite, beautiful view.

It is just opposite the berthing station of the Lido. There are boats going to Venice day and night.

You can still watch the cruise liners turn in front of the hotel and then make their stately way up the Guidecca Canal. The hotel still therefore lives up to its name, offering a Panoramic view of the lagoon. If you take breakfast on the terrace you will see the unparelled view of the Venetian lagoon and watch the endless flow of water traffic. Try to get a room with a lagoon view, it literally will make your holiday special. The staff are friendly and very helpful, especially Eugenio who has welcomed us to the hotel over a number of years. We missed Sabrina but wish her well with her new baby daughter. If you are uncertain about anything then ask staff for advice and they will be very willing to offer tips and advice on any aspect of the city or travel. The hotel is not situated on the main island of Venice, but on the Lido, a separate island a short vaporetta ride away. The Lido offers a number of restaurants and bars close to the hotel. You may have to book for the Gran Viale or eat early. Others will probably be able to accommodate you immediately or after a short wait. The Vaporetta (waterbus) stops right in front of the hotel. We love the ride across the lagoon in the morning and back again at night. It adds an extra dimension to the holiday. The Vaporetta No. 1 is the main tourist choice as it goes the full length of the grand canal. It starts at the Lido so if you want a seat at the front with the best view then you have a much better chance of getting this if you stay on the Lido. I particularly love doing the trip at night when the buildings are lit up and you can see the wonderful chandeliers in the palaces and hotels and their reflection in the canal. You can also take trips on other routes around Venice or visit other islands from the Lido. One tip, if you visit St Mark's then do so at lunchtime when the lights are on to illuminate the magnificent golden ceiling with its wonderful mosaics. Check the web for times but when were were there they went on at 11.30 and are on for an hour. If you go up the stairs to the right just inside the door (before you actually enter the basilica itself) you will be right up close to the mosaics and get the best experience. From here you also can go out onto the balcony overlooking the square. The rooms at the hotel are clean and comfortable and they offer a continental breakfast of ham, cheese, eggs, toast, cereal and cakes.

The hotel is a modestly sized building, like most in Venice, although the neighborhood has quite a different feel, being on the Lido. Absolutely no complaints about our stay--the room was clean, comfortable and as it was a (recommended) junior suite, spacious. The included breakfast was limited, but quite good. Venice is an expensive place to stay, and the Panorama is not inexpensive. Yet it is a good value compared to similar hotels in the central area. The trade-off is having to take the vaporetto every day, but aside from it being a boat, it's not much different than taking a bus in other cities.

Each room had a double and a zed-bed, fully fitted shower room and looked very comfortable. The vaparetto stop was right outside the hotel which took us daily by waterbus to Venice itself. A multiple use ticket is essential and will be well used, you can buy one at the waterbus stop. After a peaceful night's sleep (shutters at the windows blocked out sound and light) breakfast was eat what you like, continental. Cheese, meats, cereal, yoghurts, breads, pastries with juice tea & coffee. Quite sufficient to last till lunch! Nothing was too much trouble for the cheerful staff, even when we needed some sweets as stakes in a card game at 1 o'clock in the morning! Advice, tips & conversation, all came easily and were always delivered with a smile. As with all of Venice, I would recommend eating away from the main haunts and the Lido was perfect for this. Just around the corner from the hotel there was plenty to choose from at reasonable prices.

Due to its location on Lido Island, it costs much less than hotels of the same quality in the city. We caught the vaporetto (water bus) from the train station. The vaporetto system is easy, efficient, and a good way to get around. The stop for Lido Island is just steps away from the front door of the Panorama. You can get to San Marco, the city center, in about 30 - 45 minutes on the vaporetto. Its a lovely view coming into the city on the vaporetto, too. I enjoyed our daily \"commute\" into Venice. If you stay on the Lido, look into getting a Venice Pass which gets you unlimited use of the vaporetto system. I think its about 30 euro for a 3 day pass. A one way ticket on the vaporetto is 6 euro, so if you're going to be hopping around a lot, this is a good deal. The staff were very courteous and helpful with all our questions about transportation and dining options. All spoke excellent English with that distinct Venetian accent...I loved it! The room was decorated in cheerful yellow and green. Our room was on the first floor (which is actually the second floor, since the ground floor is number 0) and was very bright and sunny. We had a corner room, so we had three big windows. The bed was extremely comfy and the AC system worked very well. The bathroom was very spacious, compared with what we had at other places. There was no tub though. The room was spotlessly clean. One complaint I had was that there were not enough electrical outlets. We had to unplug things to charge our phone/camera, etc. This was not a major problem though. The breakfast was good...I especially enjoyed the brioche cioccolato. On nice days, you can have breakfast up on the terrace, which has a nice view of the lagoon and the city of Venice. There are a few good restaurants around the corner and down the street a bit, but dining is probably better across the lagoon. The beach area on the other side of the Lido, which faces the Adriatic Sea, has a nice view as well. We flew out of Venice and got to the airport on the \"Alilaguna\" boat. Tickets for this are 13 euro each and the boat runs about every 45 minutes or so, leaving from the stop across the street from the hotel. The ride to the airport takes about an hour. So getting around is not a problem at all from the Lido, and this location saves you from the hustle and bustle of Venice, not to mention rolling your luggage across footbridges and tiny little crowded streets in the city.

We stayed here based on the price and recommendations of other reviews on Trip Advisor. The only person who didn't speak english was the maid (she also worked in the breakfast room). The hotel is VERY convenient- right across the street from the water buses. The bus system by the way was good and easy to follow. (Although on Friday (our only full day in Venice) the water buses were on strike. Thankfully there were still water buses going back and forth from Lido to San Marco so the strike really didn't impact our vacation.) I loved the water bus rides because everything around you is so picturesque and amazing (I would stand during the rides rather than sit below in the seats). My husband who doesn't like crowds and such was very happy that we stayed on Lido. The room size was fine. It seemed small at first but then once I got use to it it didn't seem as small. We stayed in a standard room with a view. We could have upgraded to a room with a view of St Marks but we didn't feel it was worth the extra 30 or 40 euros per night. Plus there was construction going on around the water bus/waterway in front of the hotel. Just a word of caution- there were some hotels that we saw near St Mark's square that had noisy construction going on. I would have been upset if I payed top dollar for a hotel in that area and there was noisy/ugly construction going on. On Saturday morning before we left to go to the cruise ship, we rode a 4 wheeled bicycle for two around Lido for only 10 euros per hour. It was so much fun! Lido is a beautiful area. My only disappointment with Lido was the fact that the beaches weren't open. You could still go to the beach but it was dirty and there was trash and such around. The beaches open in June. If I went again, I would go in June rather than May. As for restaurants, we ate at the Grand Viale and the Roxy. Both were good. The Grand Viale was better although the service was a bit better at the Roxy. The fettuccine carbonara was amazing!

We ate in restaurants on Lido island each night and were glad to be back, away from the frantic pace of life in the centre of Venice.

He also arranged a bottle of champagne in our room when we returned from the first night. He did all of this with a smile and he even refuse a tip, and I tried forcing it on him twice. Eugenio made our stay, he even told us where to get the best gondola ride and not to pay over a certain amount. He has all the inside scoops. As for the hotel, it was brilliant. Staying on Lido is a million times better than Venice. To get to Venice you just take a 5 minute water taxi. On Lido you can relax and avoid all the crowds. Their free breakfast was by far the best we had in the 3 hotels in Italy and the breakfast room has the best view of Venice in the morning. Be sure to dine at the restaurant a couple blocks away on the main street. Eugenio recommended it to us and it was the best Italian food we had on the trip. We ate there 3 times over two days.

Word of warning though; this does not include the 'water-taxi' from the airport (Marco Polo) to Venice. But that wasn't a problem. We boarded Bus 5 which took us to Piazzale Roma and from there we caught a vaporetto to the Lido. On our return home we did get the 'water-taxi' from the Lido to the airport, for which we paid 12 euros each. Venice is spectacular and certainly lived up to my expectations. We did a walking tour (around 2 hours) just to get our bearings. The tour also included entry to the Basilica and an optional boat trip to Murano afterwards. Make the most of Venice, don't rush from one 'site' to the next. Venice is heaving with tourists all year round; pushing through the crowds will only lessen your enjoyment of such a beautiful city and raise your blood pressure too! Slow down and enjoy it. Although I thoroughly loved Venice, I have to admit that one of my favourite experiences was hiring bikes on the Lido and spending a few hours exploring the island.

I am not aware of any hotel that can provide a better view of this than Hotel Panorama. The view from its 'superior' rooms and terrace is simply stunning, especially when there is a colourful sunset. In addition, it's interesting watching all the water-borne traffic on the Basin, ie waterbuses, watertaxis, private boats, ferries and cruise boats. The Lido is only ten minutes away from St Mark's Square by waterbus. And Hotel Panorama is right beside the waterbus stop. Venice is a city where the mode of transportation is by boat. Accordingly, I like getting into the spirit of things by using the water-borne transportation. To me, Venice is one of the most fascinating cities in the world. It is unique. Venice gives tourists the opportunity to enjoy history, culture, museums, historical buildings and churches, music and casinos. However, it can be very busy. After a day exploring Venice, it is nice to retreat to the Lido which is quieter to relax. Hotel Panorama also sells vouchers to a private beach. I think they were 10 euros.

We found Venice to be sooooooooooo busy that it was great to get away from the crowds at the end of the day. Another nice thing about staying on Lido is that the food and especially the drinks (not just alcohol, but also soda) is considerably cheaper! In restaurants in Venice it is not uncommon for Cokes to cost 8 Euros! The hotel itself was very nice, and the breakfast (which was included) was wonderful! The staff at the hotel was exceptionally helpful. We were given a map, good directions, suggestions of places to eat, etc. Staying at the Hotel Panorama also allows access to the private beach in Lido. For 10 Euros, we were able to get access to the beach, our own umbrella and chairs reserved for the day, and beach towels. We really enjoyed the beach! Another plus of the hotel is the roof top terrace from which you can get views of Venice. Even though the hotel does not have a restaurant, there is one right next door that has good food for reasonable prices. The only complaint at all is that the room was not the biggest one we have ever stayed in, however, the furnishings were nice and the bed was comfortable. Also, the bathroom was spacious and nice. Overall a wonderful stay! If going to Venice again I would definitely stay in Lido, and at the Hotel Panorama!", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it here\u201d", "Author": "efc607", "ReviewID": "UR16803511", "Content": "My parents and I stayed for three nights at the Panorama and loved it.

The hotel was great for our purposes. It was clean and tidy and the staff were helpful. The hotel's two best aspects are its terrace and its location. We tended to go to the local supermarket for delicious cheap Italian food and take it onto the terrace for a leisurely lunch. The location of the hotel was amazing. It was just across the road from the water bus station and when we got a water taxi (an expensive treat, but more fun than a gondola ride!) it dropped us off just across from the hotel. The hotel is just near the top of Lido's main tourist street and about a 15 minute walk from the beech. There were some great restaurants on Lido's main street. We particularly liked La Cupola. It's more of a cafe than a restaurant, but the food is better than anything we had in Venice and a lot cheaper. It's run by a genuinely nice family and they treated us so well - it really made the holiday! We also loved a bar on the beach called the Aurora Beach club. They had delicious cocktails, but if you're on a budget, just ask for a spritzer - they're cheap and quite strong! We spent most of our time on Lido, on the beach or going for walks. When we did venture into Venice, we took a water bus, which only takes about 10 minutes. Venice is beautiful and very impressive, but very busy and full of tourists. We enjoyed wandering round the Rialto Market to pick up holiday gifts. We sat and had a couple of rip-off Bellinis in St Mark's Square (15 euros per drink and tasted horrible!). We went on a gondola ride. Again, a bit of a rip-off, but you've got to do it once, I suppose! We paid 100 euro for 30 mins. Even though we enjoyed Venice, we were relieved to get the water bus back to slow paced Lido. Don't go to Lido if you want a party atmosphere, though. Most bars are shut by 12. It's a great place for couples and amazing for families. Children are everywhere and everyone seems to keep their kids up till about 11 at night. It's great, because all places really welcome children and it means you don't have to worry about a babysitter - just take them out with you. The aurora beach club is partially on the sand, so parents can enjoy a drink whilst watching their kids run about on the sand.

I would tell you all about the great points, however the other reviewers have already written about those. My complaints would be: When we arrived we tried to use their wifi internet access but it wasn't working, I went to complain but the man on reception didn't report it to the manager or anybody else (they use quite a few staff members and rotate the receptionists). The following day we complained again to a younger receptionist who helped us out explaining they'd either fix it or let use use their pc downstairs for free. After 3 days it was up and running so we were ok. As for the breakfast there, it was wonderful everyday, lots of choices and everything was of excellent quality however we had to get down to the breakfast room early everyday because all the good ham was always gone by 9 (breakfast is from 07:30 - 10:00). The major let-down was the air conditioning in our room, it wouldn't stop sqeaking like a hamster's excercise wheel, all day and all night. We didn't even keep the air con on, when it was \"off\" it was in fan mode so it still squealed. We didn't complain however because although the room was a standard one, it was a very nice standard with 3 windows, one looking out to the terrace and 2 out to the street therefore it was very bright and airy. We didn't want the room swapped and we didn't want to be kept put of the room indefinitely while they fixed the fan. Another complaint is the fact that on the hotel's website they mention \"access to a private beach\" and also says the hotel is only a 5 min walk from the beach but it gives no more info. Well, the 5 min walk is to the free beach (which in August is obviously totally packed and a bit dirty (fag ends in the sand). The private beach is a good 20 min walk away from the hotel and it's not complimentary, it's concessionary. When customers of the Panorama use this beach, they charge 10 Euros per person per day (at least they did when we went, in August). It's a lovely beach, very clean and not at all crowded with clean toilet and wash-hand facilities and showers at hand. This entitles you to a parasol and reclining sun loungers.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice. Lido is a great base, It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a simple 10 minute waterbus journey to Venice itself, the boat dropping you off directly at Saint Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, we found this to be much easier (and probably a lot quicker) than fighting your way through the crowds in the narrow streets of Venice to get to the main attractions. The Lido is also a much cheaper alternative for food and drink, while not compromising on quality. There is an abundance of bars and restaurants on the Lido, all within easy walking distance from the hotel. We asked at the hotel for recommendations for our last night and the gentleman at reception called around for us until he found a table at a lovely restaurant around the corner. Our first 2 choices were fully booked so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wanting to make sure you can get into a nice restaurant one night I suggest you book in advance. We made use of the terrace a few times during our stay, the waiter will take your drinks order from there. The view is lovely, although you need to stand to see most of it as the railing comes up a little too high to get the full effect when sitting down! We also took breakfast up there on our last day, you will need to ask for a tray. The breakfast itself was lovely\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I went for croissants, unfortunately no plain ones in sight.. either fruit, custard or chocolate. There was a good selection of cereals, cheese, ham, fruit and bread for toast. We were booked into a superior room with a lagoon view. The room was a little on the small side but had everything we needed. The bathroom was a good size, massive sink, shower was adequate if a little smaller than we were used to. The bedroom had a gorgeous view of Venice over the lagoon, the waterbus stop was directly opposite, however the sound was almost completely blocked out once the window and shutters were closed. We had a little disturbance on our first night with people talking (Loudly!) and slamming doors in the corridor, this was a one off however as we had no trouble the second and third nights. The TV has Sky and there are 2 or 3 English news channels. We did have a slight problem one night when ordering a film through Sky, we selected it in English, however when the film started it was dubbed in Italian. We spoke to the receptionist and we were not charged for this at the end of our stay. The journey to the hotel from the airport was very simple. We purchased our tickets for the airport waterbus from the airport itself (12 euros), and we also purchased our 72 hour Vaparetto (Waterbus) ticket at the same time (30 Euros). One thing we were not told was that you must stamp these waterbus tickets using the yellow machines at the waterbus stops\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 one of the ticket inspectors had to handwrite the date and time we bought the tickets on herself.. oops. The airport bus stops at Murano before heading to the Lido.. it takes about an hour. However, you can see the hotel from the bus a few minutes before we reach the stop. So no asking for directions! Heading into Venice we took the number 1 over to Saint Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, this takes 10/15 minutes, the buses run until about 12, but there is also a night bus service. We visited Saint Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Basilica, there is always a large queue outside but it moves pretty quickly, entrance is free, unless you want to go upstairs for the view, which is 3 Euros. The basilica is lovely inside, and even more magnificent on the outside. We also did the tour of the Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palace. We did try to book the Secret Itineraries tour before we went but tickets were all sold out. We paid 12 euros each to gain entry and purchased an audio guide for 5 euros each and walked around the palace ourselves, the architecture and decoration is absolutely outstanding, the history is extremely interesting and the views from some of the rooms are well worth a photo or two. We did a lot of walking in Venice, and got lost in backstreets on more than one occasion, however, we always found a waterbus stop (eventually) to take us exactly where we were heading. We were extremely surprised to find we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d walked the entire length of Venice at one point! The shopping is great, lots of back street gift shops.. the handbag shops are wonderful, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re everywhere, and my partner bought a few silk ties at very reasonable prices. As some of the other reviews mentioned.. beware of the pigeons in Saint Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, there are locals who sell bags of popcorn to entice the pigeons to sit on your hands and arms for photo opportunities. While I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of anything worse, there were a lot of tourists doing just that. On the whole an extremely enjoyable break. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to give as many tips and info as I can here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. We got most of our info from reviews found here and elsewhere so I hope this helps!", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cOff to a bad start but things improved.\u201d", "Author": "Jockscrap", "ReviewID": "UR7802886", "Content": "After a bad journey with 3 and a half hour delays, the Venice baggage handlers took 1 hour to get the bags off the plane and onto the carousal. A straightforward journey by boat took us to Lido. You buy the ticket for the airport - Lido route from the ticket office near the exit. Save yourself a bit of time later and buy your multi trip water bus ticket now. The Hotel is just across the road from the water bus stop so we were at the reception within a minute of arriving on Lido. After listening to our travel tales of woe, the receptionist then shrugged his shoulders and told us that our room had been double booked but they would put us up in a different room, and move us the following day (there are several reviews on this and other sites that mention the 'accidental' double bookings...BE WARNED). This other room was a few metres from the reception desk, with one tiny shuttered window which you wouldn't open as it was right next to a back street, at street level, with people literally walking 2 inches away. we said that we found the room completely unacceptable and were told ' But it's only for one night'. As this was my fortieth birthday, and we were only there for 5 nights, this was small consolation. My husband was really gutted that his special treat to me had been messed up. It was agreed that we would go to a hotel along the road. The first room they showed us there was just about as bad, but after explaining the shambles and disappointment because of the Hotel Panorama, they showed us a suite, which we accepted and stayed in for the first night. Things improved from there. Our room was at the front of the hotel (double room with lagoon view, on Expedia). Although it wasn't big, it was nicely decorated and very clean. we were given a complimentary bottle of something fizzy the first night there. The rooms are described as having 'en suite bathrooms' but ours just had a shower . The cubicle was tiny, with a smallish opening into it, which could be a problem if you are on the large side. Sky TV was included, and the room had a good fully adjustable aircon system installed. The bus stop wasn't noisy at all, and the big plus point with this hotel is its ideal location, and the frequent water buses. We didn't wait longer than 5 minutes for any bus. Breakfasts were good. Plates on the buffet were continuously topped up. The pure fruit juices were lovely, lots of fresh fruit, beautiful fresh pastries, crackers, toast, ham, cheeses, jam, big choice of cereals, yoghurts etc. We went to the opera one night, purchasing the tickets in the hotel, and it was a fantastic experience. The trip to the murano glass factory by private taxi is to drum up sales of course, and not the hotel being loving and giving . Use it as a way of getting over to Murano in comfort, race round the factory, admire the glass (6 tumblers for E250 anyone?) and use your own water bus pass to get you home. Do not expect to get the private taxi back if you haven't bought anything! We expected to eat on Lido most nights, but only had an evening meal there once, prefering to head off into Venice and get lost in the maze of backstreets. The window shopping is superb, the backstreet restaurants were really good, and very reasonable (E4.50 for 1/2 bottle wine, E7 for a plate of pasta, E4 for a mixed salad) and the snack lunches were really cheap...E3.50 for a delicious hot snack of rolled up thin pizza base filled with roasted veg and cheese. We saw loads of shops with very reasonably priced things in them, certainly no more expensive than home, and we were spoilt for choice with gifts to bring back home. The leather handbags seemed really reasonable. We loved Venice. Enjoy a long water bus ride (No 1) along the whole length of the Grand Canal. Get off at stops along the way and wander around the streets. You will definitely get lost, but that's all part of the fun. The yellow street signs that you follow to get to the main attractions have a funny habit of disappearing, and all sense of direction leaves you as soon as you enter these narrow, twisting streets. Top tip: wear your most comfortable shoes. You'll walk 10 times further than you think you will. We spent one full day on the hotel's private beach. There is a E10 per day charge per person for this, which includes the use of changing rooms, a parasol and sun beds. Towels are available from the hotel with a refundable deposit of E10 each. We didn't pay the fee for the beach as we believed it to be included in our hotel package. Expedia made no mention that we saw, of a charge for these facilities. The beach is well worth a visit.

We arrived at 10:30AM, and Eugenio checked us in, and got us into a room within 30 minutes. (I was totally impressed).. Words cannot describe now nice it is to stay on Lido, compared to Venice proper. We were able to take the water buses across the canal, and fight the crowds, noise, and terrible food in Venice, and then arrive back to Lido, where it was quiet, and peaceful. The cafe' next to the hotel is wonderful, and has great pizza and pasta dishes. Sample some of the Nasta Azurro beer also, it's really smooth. The automatic coffee machine was down one morning, and the staff made fresh latte's and cappucinno's for everyone with a smile. Internet access is superb, and you buy 24 hrs worth of access, that you can spread across your entire stay. After paying $.50 a minute on the cruise ship, I was in heaven.. The staff never hesitated to take the time, to address our questions about various sites, and always gave us the best routes to our day trip destinations. Food is better on Lido, and a third the price, compared to Venice. It takes 15 minutes via water bus to the San Marco Square. We did do the private Murano tour, but we had planned on purchasing a nice piece. The Marco Polo gallery was friendly, and we went on a Sunday, so it was less crowded. We watched a quick demonstration, and browsed the gallery for 30 minutes. We were \"NOT\" pressured in the least, and even when there was a communication issue over price on two pieces, the gallery staff apologized. They left us alone to make our decision, and we left with our purchases. Complimentary water taxi both ways, which was a nice gesture!

We decided upon Venice as we had always wanted to visit, and as it was such a notoriously romantic destination, it was a perfect choice to celebrate our first year of marriage! Lido is a fantastic place to base yourself from, not only is it EXTREMELY cheaper than staying in the centre of Venice itself, but it is perfect positioning to get around to see all the sights without lugging your heavy suitcases over bridges and cobbled busy streets. You have the best of both worlds if you choose to stay on Lido...you have the beach within easy walking distance (10 mins, I'd say!) and it is fantastically served by vaporetto (water buses) that were always on time when we were there, and really put our transport system to shame!! Firstly you get the Alilaguna to Lido from the airport which is 12 Euro and takes about 50 mins. Once arriving at Lido the Hotel Panorama is right opposite where you get off!! So just a few paces to your left and you'll be in the comfort of a fantastic hotel. The no 1 and 51 vaporetto takes you in and out of Venice centre and if you stay aboard, it'll take you on a lovely journey down the grand canal. A 72hr ticket costs you just 30 Euros...Bargain!!! I'm quite a fussy traveller and always check trip advisor before I book anything. I have never posted a review before, so hopefully the fact that I am doing so now to speak out about the Hotel Panorama should in itself, speak volumes! The rooms were spotlessly clean, and were served everyday by the chamber maid. Our bed was also turned down of a night time, which was something I certainly didn't expect!! But was a lovely touch! The breakfast was typically European..not a full English in sight! However, saying that it was just what we needed to start the day and there was plenty of choice. You could even have it taken up to the roof terrace, so you could enjoy your breakfast with stunning scenery! The staff were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for you!

The Easyjet staff were extremely polite and friendly..I feel quite bad to say that I wasn't expecting this with it being a budget airline, I but I'm glad we flew with them and will definately be doing so again in the future...UNLIKE MY TRAVEL who we flew to Brazil with and were diabolical, ignorant, rude, unhelpful, etc....!!!

The location on the Lido was actually very convenient - 15 minutes from San Marco by Vaporetto, quicker than many locations on the Grand Canal and it was nice to return to a quieter retreat. Even in November the city was pretty crowded, I cant imagine what it would be like in peak season, even more reason to have a haven such as the Panorama as a base. Other reviews have commented on the friendliness of the staff and we can vouch for this. Friendly and helpful, a nice combination. We paid a premium for a superior room with a lagoon view and did not regret it. The hotel is opposite the Valporetto stops and there is also a road out front but the windows kept the noise out. The room was a good size for Italy, comfortable and clean. It also and had a large bathroom with a shower but no bath, typically Italian. Breakfast was better than typical continental fare, fresh fruit, rolls, cold meats (salami and hams) and cheese, pastries, yoghurt,, cereals. The only negative thing was the lack of fresh juices, the orange and grapefruit were more like squashes. You could pay extra for the fresh variety. I would not accept the free trip to Murano again, you are placed under considerable sales pressure which I found uncomfortable- not the fault of the hotel and perhaps I was oversensitive - my girlfiend was less concerned. On the plus side the glass blowing demonstration was superb so if you have a thicker skin go for it! Murano is certainly worth a visit though, the beautiful glass works of art are fantastic - catch the Vaporetto (No 42) if you want to avoid the salesmen. Venice itself was wonderful, too much to describe here. A couple of tips though: you MUST go to San Giorgio - missed by many guide books you can go up the Camanile and from here you will have the best view of Venice - puts the view from the Campanile San Marco in the shade. It's cheaper too! Also, take the Secret Itinery tour in the Doge's Palace - facinating. Eating out can be hit and miss, try to get recommendations if possible. Avoid the Tratoria Da Biasini near the Piazzale Roma at all costs - terrible cold pasta, stale bread, expensive and unfriendly service, we ate there on our way home but wished we hadn't. However, we discovered that not all tourist traps are terrible.

It is located directly across from the water taxi/water bus landing which I thought might be noisy but isn't.

The island has lovely shops and wonderful cafes and restaurants. It's an oasis after the hustle and bustle of the city. The hotel staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.

Our room was upgraded to a junior suite for an additional 25 euros a night, which seemed very reasonable considering the amazing views we had of the lagoon. The room was large and clean and the little balconies were lovely. The staff at the Hotel Panorama were incredibly helpful and accomodating. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer than the weekend, but in the future, I won't stay anywhere else in Venice. We especially enjoyed utilising the terrace for breakfast (I can't really understand why anyone would choose to remain in the breakfast room when there are such amazing views to take in). The waitress knew immediately what we wanted and provided us with a tray so we could take our food and coffee upstairs. We also enjoyed a bottle of wine one evening on the terrace - no one said anything about us bringing our own, although we did also buy some beers from the bar. The 3 day pass (25 euros) is great for exploring Venice. We took the number 1 all the way up the Grand Canal and the number 52 around Venice - a great way to take in the sights. The manager at the Panorama recommended the Trattoria Favorita on the Lido for dinner and made the booking for us and drew us a map to find it. We had a great meal there on the Saturday night, sat outside in their garden and the scampi ravioli was amazing. The actual food in Venice wasn't brilliant (we ate pizza for lunch both days) but that restaurant was special. It was wonderful to explore Venice and then be able to return to the Lido to chill out. The beach is definitely worth checking out as well. It's only a 15 minute walk and the main street is lined with shops and cafes.

The hotel is right outside the waterbus stop, which concerned us initially, but we didn't have any noise from this and it was actually very convenient. It was nice to be able to escape the crowds of Venice to return to Lido & the short boat ride added to the fun. Buy a 11 Euro single waterbus ticket from airport (takes 45 mins), & the 72 hour waterbus ticket was very convenient for use for the rest of your stay (this is a separate company from the airport boat, so you cannot use it for the airport). Do not bother with tickets with extras, such as free use of toilets, just use the cafes you will eat at, anyway. Hotel was a medium size, clean, with a good standard of decor & the rooms were comfortable. The staff were very helpful & able to guide you with waterbuses and general information. The breakfast was a good, basic continental buffet in the ground floor dining room. On the 1st floor there is a veranda where you can sit, with views across the lagoon. We also thought paying extra for a lagoon-view room was worthwhile to appreciate Venice- otherwise you might as well be anywhere in the world. We paid 65 Euros for a 35 min gondola ride, don't let them con you into more, but it has to be experienced. Also most restuarants in Venice are disappointing- try to get recommendations. It is also worthwhile experiencing Venice at night & we found it easy to go back to the hotel to freshen up, before returning to the main island. If you have enough time, take the 15-20 minute walk to the other side of the Lido to the clean, organised & excellent beach.

Hotel Panorama is a 15min boat ride from Piazzo San Marco on Lido island, the beach resort of Venice. Not a problem as boats run 24 hours a day and you shouldn't be waiting more than 15-20mins for one. Website doesn't do the hotel justice, making it look like the usual Venetian cheese fest of gold leaf, badly co-ordinated colours and cheap tacky paintings. Instead it totally lives up to it's 4 star rating, with an attitude and demeanour from staff that would give most 5 star hotels a run for their money, doing their best to help you with any problems you may have. Most of the rooms will have a water view of some sorts, although the best (and the most expensive) are right on the front of the hotel, giving unobstructed but distant views of the Palazzo Ducale & the Campanile. The Lido water bus stop is right next to the hotel which does distract a little from the effect, but noise is not a problem and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony and watching the general commotion in the lagoon as vaporetto and skyscraper-sized cruise liners dodge each other. Only the junior suites seem to have balconies, but anyone can use the fantastic terrace for the view. You could probably even sit here and drink supermarket-bought drinks without any trouble. Breakfast was the standard issue European nonsense of croissants, yogurts, and counterfeit cereals. An Englishman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst nightmare. Bizarrely (even the waitress seemed embarrassed to ask) coffee was an extra 2 euros. It's actually served on the ground floor, not the terrace as the website suggest so ask for a tray and take it upstairs for one of the best breakfast views in the world. I doubt we'll ever stay ANYWHERE else in the future. No pool, but for about 7 euros a day, you can use a section of private beach a 15min walk away on the other side of the Lido. The Panorama will loan beach towels for a small deposit in a variety of lavish carrier bags that guests richer than us have left behind. We booked through Venere for 170 euros (\u00c2\u00a3117) a night. A quick search on Google should turn up promotional codes for this site that takes a further 4% off any bill. Check the hotels own website for short stay deals. Ignore the \"nickel & dime\" reviewer - the glass tour was discreetly suggested on checking in and never mentioned again. However, before you suspect I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m the manger in disguise I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to find something wrong with the stay so, nit-pickingly, the only irritations I can think of were: No ice machine to chill supermarket bought drinks at 10% the price of the mini-bar. Reception can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change travellers cheques, leaving a long and frustrating search ahead as banks are generally closed and some restaurants won't accept credit cards. Like the rest of Europe, striking is a pastime for the ACTV water bus staff. These usually run for 24 or 48 hours, and could leave you at the mercy of costly water taxis that would murder your holiday budget.

They try to nickel-and-dime you to death and have bad customer service. I booked though a internet travel website for 2 nights in May. I requested a double room and called the hotel to confirm my reservations a few day before I went. I simply asked if the rooms have a view of the lagoon, and was told that the standard rooms do not, but the superior rooms did. The clerk seemed very eager to offer me a superior room for an extra 20 euros a night. He then said they would show me both types of rooms when I arrived and I could choose to upgrade to the superior room. When we checked-in, the clerk said they have a supeior room for us at 20 extra euros a night, and I said \"No, thanks, we will just take the standard room\". When we went to our room, it was obviosly their \"superior room\" as it was in front of the lagoon. I went to ask the clerk, and told him that I requested a standard room...why did he not understand me all the times I said it? Anyway, I was told that there were no more standard rooms left that night, and I would have to stay in our room, but the wouldn't charge us extra. However they would have to move us the next day. That night, I started unpacking, and thought I really did not want to move rooms, so I spoke to the same clerk, and said that I would be happy to pay for the upgraded room the next night, so not to have to move. He apparently did not understand me again, because the next day we were told that we have to change rooms. I had to repack all my stuff. At this point, I saw that it was useless to argue or explain anything else to them as they have obviously not understood anything I had said before. The clerk still insisted that I requested a superior room when I did not. Our standard room actually had a better lay-out, more windows, and more closet space than the previous superior room. And we still had a view of the lagoon on the side window. Bath room counter also more spacious. Overall rooms were decent sized, carpet was old, bathroom only has small shower cubicle. Breakfast was a meager affair. Coffee and Cappucino, hot chocolate, etc all came out of a machine, like the ones you get at gas stations. It was TERRIBLE coffee for Italy. If you wanted a \"real\" cofee or cappucino, you had to pay extra 3 euros. Juice was just watery squash, and there was some cereals, yogurt, cold meats, cheeses. Not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Service was terrible, only 1 waitress, and clearly you needed more to staff a breakfast service. Kept running out of food, cups, glasses. She was busy refilling food and clearing tables. Definitely will not return. They do not place customer satisfaction at the top of their priorities, be it the rooms or breakfast.

Bear in mind it's on Lido, which is (I think) a better base for exploring Venice, since it's not as crampled and full of tourists as the main Venice islands, and has some excellent restaurants and trattorias nearby - but Lido is a separate island, which means St Marks Square et al are a vaporetto (water bus) ride away. To avoid duplicating the comments of others, I'll tell you a couple of things I didn't know before I went. The hotel is right by the shore, and also just by the Vaporetti stop. The view from the lagoon facing rooms is fabulous - and you can see the massive cruise ships sailing up and down the Guidecca canal. If you can't get a lagoon room, the view from the terrace is stunning (don't miss the terrace - we did until our last night!). This makes it ideally placed for getting to the main Venice island - also where the Alilaguna boats which run from the airport dock - but I did worry about the noise, since the Vaporetti run from early in the morning until late at night. I needn't have - the double glazing is good, and the air conditioning is better, which means you'll have no trouble sleeping. All the staff were lovely, the standard of cleanliness within the hotel was excellent. There's a water taxi stop not far from the hotel, but be aware that water taxis don't normally wait there for pickups - if you want a water taxi best to ask at the hotel reception to ring for one. A corner of the hotel is given over to a bank branch, which means you have an ATM just around the corner from the hotel entrance. The hotel doesn't have any restaurant or room-service food, other than the breakfast, which is nothing to write home about, but it's adequate.

Thank you so much to everybody for recommending this place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you made our holiday! We purchased our rooms from the internet for just over \u00c2\u00a3100 a night for a Superior Double room overlooking the Lagoon. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a lovely chap (all the staff are excellent) who showed us to our room (No. 105). It was very small, but lovely nonetheless, with a king size bed, wardrobe, dressing table with TV (7 channels, all Italian), safe, bedside tables, chest of drawers and a mini-bar. The bathroom was nice, and included a heated towel rail and a really nice wash basin and bidet. There was no bath, but a shower cubicle instead. There were double floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom and bathroom which opened out onto the small balcony overlooking the lagoon and waterbus stop. After showing us this room, the gentleman then took us upstairs to show us another room, which he said we could upgrade to for an extra 20 Euros per night. It was twice the size of the room downstairs, with a larger bathroom and a Jacuzzi bath with a shower head attached (no shower curtain or glass though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there would be no room to stand up as it was more of an attic room). The massive downside to this room, however, was the fact that you could not see out of the window without having to walk up some steps and peer out of the small window at the end of the room. Because the room was darker, lacked a proper shower and cost more, we opted for the smaller one downstairs. Great choice! The Positives: Lovely staff; fantastic shower; nice complementary breakfast (with plenty of choice); clean, cosy rooms with great view; situated in a lovely location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ideal for the waterbus and only 8 minutes from a beautiful beach! The Negatives: 90% of the things in the mini-bar were MONTHS out of date! Bed wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most fantastic I have ever slept in; breakfast coffee and toast (amongst other things) were at an additional cost; I was slightly disappointed by restaurant recommendations made by the staff, but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really their fault because there are seemingly very few excellent places to eat in Venice.

They changed us to a room in the attic, which still had the jacquzzi bath that i wanted and a view of St Marks basin. The room was nicely decorated was clean - there was a mini bar, safe tv etc.. at because of the mix up with our suite they had left us a bottle of sparkling wine which was a nice touch. There was alo a massive bowl of fruit too. They only problem with the room was that it was soo hot! All the other rooms must have had their heating on and because heat rises it all seemed to gather in our room! So we had to have the windows mide open all night else we would have melted but then this resulted in us being up most of the night with the noise from the water bus station. However, when the windows were closed you couldn't hear anything - so it was a case of suffer the heat or suffer the noise! The breakfast was simple was tasty - being lactose intolerant it was quite hard to find things i could eat! But the coffee was lovely! The staff were so super friendly and did everything they could to make our stay more enjoyable. They all spoke great English and gave us maps and told us where to go etc.. which was really helpful. They arranged a free taxi and entrance for us to the glass museum at Murano which ran really smoothly with no problems etc... Being on the Lido didn't make a difference because there are boats coming all the time to go to St Marks square and it was nice to take a trip over the water. Unfortunately we didn't find 1 nice restaurant in Venice but that's hardly the hotels fault! I'm sure there are lots of hotels like this in Lido and other parts of Venice but the staff here really make the difference to choosing this hotel to another.", "Date": "February 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, England", "Title": "\u201cThe Panorama is a gem!\u201d", "Author": "rachel337", "ReviewID": "UR3027748", "Content": "It was with some trepidation that I booked this hotel over the internet with nothing but the previous reviews of Trip advisor reviewers to go on. The booking process, conducted via email was courteous and even incuded detailed emailed directions on how to find the hotel, which ferry line to get, the cost of tickets and a map. That's service! We set off cautious but hopeful to Venice. The trip accross the lagoon to the Lido was incredible, a real experience and very easy. You buy your tickets in the airport concourse then board a free shuttle bus (or Navette) to the port. Do not mistake the floating dock for the boat and crush to get on it! Far better to stand on the solid ground as the square boat like contraption that serves as a boarding platform rocks quite alarmingly! When the alilaguna ferry arrives the staff are very organised. Just tell them which stop you want to get off at (Lido for the Hotel panorama) and they will store your luggage securely and give it back to you as you are ready to disembark. It takes about 50 minutes to the Lido from the airport. When we got to our destination there was a mixup. We did not know that the dock opposite the hotel Panorama where the boats all usually stop was out of action for a week for the airport boat only. The Hotel Panorama had emailed us as soon as they knew with directions of how to board the free navette to outside the hotel but as I only have email at work and had been off for two days previous to my holiday we didn't get the message. We ended up walking a considerable distance with heavy bags. If this happens to you and you come in at anywhere other than Lido stop, look for the free bus!! When we reached the Panorama, hot and sweaty and stressed they greated us like longlost friends, offered us free drinks to get readjusted and appologised profusely for us not getting their email! The staff could not have been sweeter. we were shown to our room which we had paid extra for in order to have a lagoon view. The room was charming. well decorated with a lovely marble bathroom (shower only) and of an adequate size. The view over Venice was gorgeous. Two small niggles about the room. 1) not much cupboard/wardrobe space 2) very little shelf space in the bathroom to put make-up, wash stuff, etc. However, the staff at the hotel tell us that this is being changed as they refurbish the rooms. Not that they look like they need refurbishing. We came for 4 nights and there was just about enough room for our stuff (I admit I am not of the minamlist school of packing but neither am I in the habit of bringing the kitchen sink.) If you are coming for longer, you may need to edit your packing or enquire if they have added bigger wardrobes. The breakfast is ample with a reasonable selection of different breads, cheeses, pastries fruit and yoghurt. The coffee is delicious. where the panorama really comes into its own is the staff who are so helpful and knowledgable and dedicated to helping you get the most out of their glorious city. Of additional massive benefit is the location. The hotel couldn't be closer to the main no.1 line into Venice. It takes about 12 minutes to reach St Marks Square or San Zaccharia as the stop is called and what a fabulous priviledge it is make that awesome journey every morning. the view and the experience of cruising up the grand canal is just incredible. It is so beautiful it almost made me want to weep. Venice itself is incomparable in its beauty, its majesty and just the sheer spectacle it provides. Every courner you turn gives a new magical view. This is a city for walking. Bring comfortable shoes and tramp to your hearts delight. Buy a three day ferry pass and hop on and off the different ferry lines and explore every nook and cranny. As a shop-a-holic I can report that there are bargains to be found. In the St Marks square area you have your designers alongside small boutiques. The designer stuff is standard prices but don't shop in the boutiques here. If you walk not more than five minutes from the square you will see the same items for less. the further you walk the more you can save. For example, the same pair of shoes near St Marks 100 euros; in Dorsoduro, 65 euros. The two best authentic Venetian shopping finds for me were the street that runs parallel to the Grand Canal if you get off at Ca Doro. Walk up the small alley behind the ferry stop and turn right. Excellent bargains in glassware to be found here. the second was a little harder to find. there is a lovely little street that runs from behind the Rialto Bridge all the way to the academia, zig zagging all the way. You need to get off at the Academia and walk just to the right of the gallery entrance, weave your way kind of straight on and right and you will see various piazzas opening up in front of you. the main flow of traffic will take you the right way, just go with it. It is fascinating and a good place to find classic shoes and bags. Another good road is the Frizzaria that goes off of the St Marks Square area. Lovely shoe shops! We visited in October and were concerned about the possibility of Aqua Alta (high water and flooding). well, it was a certainty and an absolute hoot! Don't worry about it, the Venetians are well prepared. walk on the duckboards that are laid out on all main routes and keep you dry, as long as you don't mind getting friendly with the other tourists as you all try to navigate your way around. Be prepared to get a little damp in the shoe area if you go off the beaten track or to get hopelessly lost trying to navigate via high ground but it is just good fun and all gone by about 11.30 am. The sight of st Marks Square, filled with water and being sloshed through by the locals in their Prada wellies is something to behold! Lido itself is pleasant. there is a nice little main street with a fabulous Deli called Rizzo. We cut the eating out costs by having one evening where we sat in our room and watched the sun set over Venice and ate sicilian cherry tomatoes, freshly baked walnut bread, Dolcelatte and proscuttio, with fresh pears and peaches for desert all brought from Rizzo. the Venetian food is good. Plenty of choice and if you stick to the places frequented by locals, the standard is high and the cost is average. One place NOT to eat Bentigodi near the Ghetto Nuevo. we walked for miles to find it as it had a good review in Time Out to find innedible food. It was truly awful with our meal (tuna Steak and fillet steak respectively) coming to the table nearly raw (not rare- there is a diference). Go to Venice, stay at the Panorama and have a wonderful time. This city is the the most amazing in the world and the Panorama is a good quality hotel, fastidiously clean with fabulous staff who will really help you get the most of your stay. They even stored our luggage for us after we checked out and helped us carry it over the road to get the ferry.

Firstly, the transfer from the airport to the Lido is about an hour and can be longer if you get an old Aliliaguna not the new ones. The Hotel is right in front of the boat stop so don't be worried about finding it. The staff were excellent at all times, friendly conversations willing to help and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are a little small but very clean if not a little cold with no obvious way of heating the room up. I think this is a rouse to get couples closer so they keep warm and with such excellent views across the Lagoon, who can blame them. There was a little work on the building going on while we there but it was very substantial and only woke us one morning. The breakfast was sparce in choice but get there early enough and there is plenty to fill up on. There were all the facilities you can need and it's location is a great selling point as you can see the hotel as you come across the lagoon in a water bus.

While it looked and was as described, it was just a common, older, 2-star tourist hotel nowhere worth the $262.00/nt. (this being Venice) which it cost. On arriving after a long vaporetto wait, drag & ride from the train station with heavy bags from a Med. cruise, we learned without prior notice that our paid-for room had been resold, that the responsible idiot/clerk \"had been fired\" (rubbish!) and that they had placed us into a friendly-competitor hotel, the Best Western Hotel/Villa Biasuti nearby and would pay to cab us there. Biasuti was MUCH nicer, Panorama paid for our first 2 nights, but then dragged us back for our last night, which wasn't nearly as nice. Despite the better, front-facing room we got with good views of the lagoon, the city and maritime traffic, it was just a small room of 11x12', no AC, no window screens, an old bed and one of those tiny, improvised shower stalls in which no 6'2\", 215-lb guest could barely turn around, a joke by US standards. The included breakfast was average, the hotel and room were clean and in good repair, but furnished with a Hitler-era decor which needed a lot of help, preferably a woman's. I'd never want to stay in any room toward the back or sides; not at these prices. While the middle-aged, male, front-desk staff acted very personably, their words and gestures rang false and could not make up for having bounced us out without notice at the high prices which this simple hotel charged. Yet, as sleeping out on the Lido was definitely the way to go, just stay at the Villa Biasuti or elsewhere as this little hotel wasn't worth more than $130 at best. For $262, I expect a 4 or 5-star place and will stay in the US and $-denominated nations until the ridiculous pricing of the Euro comes down. On balance, I conclude that this place was well located, poor in property, good in staff, so-so in execution and not worth anywhere its high prices. I would stay elsewhere,but on the Lido.
