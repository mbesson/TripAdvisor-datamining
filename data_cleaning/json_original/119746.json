Nice location, and spacious room, mainly due to the smaller bed size (not a king). The front desk clerk seemed to have an attitude from the time of check in. We arrived with friends who had a dog. Although the hotel offered pet rooms the dog was not ours, was not staying with us, and was not coming in our room. The clerk seemed rather over concerned with the dog, and so I made it a point to make sure the dog did not even come close to our room His careful eye, was rather uncomfortable. We were respecting the pet policy, and had nothing to make him assume we wouldn't. The following day of check out, he was prompt to notify us of the 11 am check out time. As I turned in my key I mentioned our bathroom sink was clogged and not draining, due to the latch coming off hooked from the drop stopper. The same front desk personal insisted on escorting me to take a look. I had picked up the room prior of any debris. Only the bed was unmade and I had placed the used wet towels in a pile under the sink so the maid could pick them all up together. When the Clerk noticed the towels he became very rude and condescending to me. He asked why i would throw them on the floor and why they were so \"filthy\". He picked each towel with his fingertips and a disgusted look on his face, inspecting it. I explained the tile bathroom floor was dirty (not from us) and the towels had justs soaked up some of the dirt. I told him it was nothing that wouldn't come out when washed. He began to insult me by saying I was dirty and do I throw towels on the floor in my own home. I explained I didn't understand the big deal and sarcastically asked if he wanted me to wash them for him. To my surprise he said yes and scooped them all up and handed them to me. I have yet to see if I have been charged on my credit card for incidental fees. I want to add, all the towels were obiviously old and used, very low end quality and the bath towels already had holes in them. The dirt on the towels was tracked into the tile bathroom from his hotel room carpet being dirty. I washed them in hot water and bleach as soon as I got home, and what do you know!? All dirt washed out. I plan on returning them to the hotel this week. regardless of condition of the towels and how they got that way, this hotel staff should be polite to any paying guest.

The funishings inside were a little tired, but we never plan on spending much time in a hotel room, so it didn't matter to us. This hotel was also amongst the lowest price we found in the area, so we didn't expect a palace. Unfortunately, our night was completely ruined by some irresponsible louts who returned to their room at about 1am and proceeded to shout and scream outside in the car park at the top of their voices until about 4am. We've stayed in motel style places before, and have been disturbed many times in the past but this noise was like nothing on earth. On three seperate occassions we tried to call the front desk to complain, but the phone line was permanently engaged (had they taken the phone off the hook?)

Wow was I surprised to find out our room was a suite! I was not expecting this, and it was a nice change from staying 2 weeks in other hotel rooms only (and for the same price). We stayed for 3 days (2 nights). I have posted video of our room so I guess you can find that in my profile. It was a nice suite, nice couch which pulled out to a bed, our queen bed was comfortable, decoration was nice, nice new windows all around, shower had good water pressure, full size fridge & stove and kitchenette. Our kitchen even had pots & pans, plates, bowls and utensils which had I known I would be in a suite would have been awesome! There was even an in room safe which was great! The marina was a block from the hotel and there was a Jack in the box across the street, KFC, McD's, and Denny's Restaurant really close by in walking distance. Not too far a drive away ( a couple miles) I discovered a Target store and Chillis Restaurant, Red Lobster, Black Angus and another nice BBQ restaurant. The airport was a short drive and there was no close airplane noises. The only thing in the room I personally would have liked would have been dark curtains for the two windows in the kitchen, the blinds let in too much light when trying to sleep and also one of the blinds wasn't long enough on one window as well. But other then that the suite was really nice. The Continental breakfast provided by the hotel consisted of boxed cereal and milk and orange juice and danish only which were individually wrapped so that was nice. We personally would have appreciated a 2nd juice being allergic to oranges and maybe a toast machine with bread or bagels, but having the cereal option for the kids was great! The free breakfast just was not the same scale as a couple other hotels we had been at but still better then 1 of them but the bonus of having the suite out weighted all the other places anyways. They were training a new front desk person when we arrived so I can't comment on the front desk service except that the guy doing the training on July 10 was really nice and professional! I did get annoyed one night with the people above us, I swear they were letting their kids jump up and down late at night and it sounded like a bunch of elephants. I felt so sorry for the maid, she looked young and was by herself to do the whole place - all they have is one small washing machine and one dryer for her to try and do all towels and linen in daily. I don't know how that is possible. I can't comment on the maid service either because I left a do not disturd sign on our door the whole time, which I'm sure she was grateful for. The parking lot is pretty small but it is a small hotel so what can you do...I counted 15 suites but only 11 parking stalls, + 1 Handicap space, so I could see if there was a full house parking could become a problem since the side streets were always full up as well but maybe not everyone comes with a vehicle so therefore parking might be fine. I notice they list 14 suites here, so maybe there isn't 15. I had no problems with my stay and would definitely stay there again if I had to stay in San Diego again. However I can see that they really need to come up with a solution with doing the hotel laundry -There is no room on the property to make a larger laundry area except maybe the little space at the back or maybe they should consider making one suite into a small single room and turning one of the kitchenettes and part of one suite into a decent size hotel laundry room so they can provide clean towels on a daily basis and clean the hotel bedding. At the very least they might be able to get two stacking washer/dryer combo's in the existing tiny laundry room - or prehaps out source their laundry (Maybe that is already what they do with the sheets??? I don't know...) I know I was beside their laundry room and all I ever saw was mounds of towels on top the one machine and no one around. But don't quote me anyways, for all I know they may have another laundry room they use on the upper level???

We booked the Point Loma Inn site-unseen, aside from the information we found on the Internet. When we arrived and checked in there were some, shall we say, seemingly shady people staying in one of the rooms...which turned out to be next door to the room one of my friends was ultimately staying in. These people were casing our truck while we were checking in - the first alarm bell. After checking in one of my friends and I were given a room upstairs - except that there was still someone staying in it. After the guy finally wandered out with his stuff (which consisted of the clothes on his back and an extra pair of jeans) he left behind a bunch of fast food trash. The lady at the front counter said that she would have the room cleaned up in 30 minutes. We went to get something to eat and were gone over an hour. Upon our return the room was still not ready. In fact the door had been left wide open the whole time. Again we were told that the room would be ready in just a little while and yes they were very sorry. A couple of hours later we basically had to stay and watch the front desk lady prepare our room because the maid had left for the day. While watching our room upstairs be prepared we hung out out front of our other two friends rooms (which were next to each other on the first floor) and observed a rather interesting parade of people showing up at the Shady People's room. Some were let in and some were ignored. That night the Shady People opened for business. It seems that had, um, \"stuff\" for sale and were up until all hours of the night, much to our chagrin. The next morning we let the lady at the front desk in on the Shady People's activities of the night before, as well as the fact that there were cockroaches in one of my friend's bathroom...and strange fluids on the ceiling...and burn marks on the walls. We asked for our money back for the two nights we had paid for that we were not going to stay - we had no problems paying for the night we had spent there. We were then informed that there would be a $40 cancellation fee charged for our early check-out. Needless to say I would never ever ever ever stay here again nor would I recommend this place to anyone.
