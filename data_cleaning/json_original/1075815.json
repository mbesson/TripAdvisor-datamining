After a lot of time spent on the internet, we chose the Melarose as we felt it offered the best value for money in terms of mid-range hotels (based upon the hotel website, services, room photos etc.). It could not have been more misleading- our first night we didn\u2019t even have a double bed but 2 singles put together, the room was cold/damp and the lights were so dim that it was dark. The next day we changed rooms in favour of a big single bed (140cm) so we could actually sleep together. The room was a bit nicer but it was tiny, the bed wasn\u2019t very comfy, the fixtures/lights were shabby, towels were thin, worn and coarse and on top of everything, after a long night out clubbing we couldn\u2019t even close the blinds to get some early morning sleep as there were none. I\u2019ve never written a review in trip advisor but felt I had too this time as the hotel website is really misleading. there is nothing feng shui about this place. they charge the same rates as nice midrange 3/4 star hotels but give none of the service or comfort you would expect, so disappointed as it was my birthday weekend and we wanted to spoil ourselves. \u20ac 350 wasted on a crap hotel. Location was ok, but if you\u2019re looking to stay in a good value mid-range hotel, this isn\u2019t it. Don\u2019t stay here.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice, simple hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "briochelover", "ReviewID": "UR63094651", "Content": "Rooms are very small, but clean and comfortable.

I still rated it high because: The hotel is new, the rooms are very small but completely sufficient and clean. Shower baths, no tubs. Furniture very minimalistic (but traditional) according to the Feng Shui Principle. Extremely quiet - I have never slept better in any hotel. What was amazing was the price: i payed 39eur for a single room/night. With the tram you can reach Alexanderplatz within 5 minutes; the oh-so hip Prenzlauer Berg is right next doors (Kollwitzplatz is a 5-10 minute walk). I liked it. If you need lots of space it might not be what you want (i am thinking of travellers from North America who are used to spacious hotels). Highly recommendable for travelers on a buget who will not spend much time in the hotel room.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Feng Shui Hotel Melarose", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1075815-Reviews-Feng_Shui_Hotel_Melarose-Berlin.html", "Price": "$77 - $143*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Greifswalder Str. 199</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10405</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1075815", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/51/e5/51e5478d481faf3382a4a2ffdf32d3b87large.jpg"}}
