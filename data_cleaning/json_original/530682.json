The pool area has a zero depth area for the young ones, water slides, and a hot tub and is very large. There are a variety of bedroom choices to choose from. There are several places that you can eat on site and a Publix a few blocks away. This past visit we stayed in a 3 bedroom Presidential Suite. The Suite was awesome, but a huge let down when we came into the room and discovered we had Street/construction view, rather than the beautiful pool view. It would have been nice to know that some of these high point rooms do NOT have pool view. Also, the wifi service was TERRIBLE in the room. It would not stay connected at all and was very frustrating.

It isn't too much of a car ride to Universal Studios or even Disneyland, it has a great location, and quite a bit of property, allowing for many buildings to house customers. Rooms: The rooms were stellar, they weren't the 'Top of the line' but they were certainly modern, and very clean. The well kept apartment style rooms also contained the full amenities that you would expect from a nice resort. Fully loaded kitchen, etc. The bedrooms were also very nice, nothing that really comes to the top of my head, but none the less a very comfortable stay. The resort itself had a couple of pools, and lovely fountains that were located in the middle of the resort. While the pools were big and well kept, so was the ground itself. Personally took a couple of walks around the resort because it is just stellar on a sunny day, and large enough to get a good walk in even. Staff seemed to be well mannered and helpful, certainly a very comfortable place.

My in-laws had signed up to go to the sales pitch, so we got a free vacation...I was totally surprised at how much I liked it. I went into this thinking it would be an \"okay\" little condo, just like any time share kind of place. Oh no...it was more like a 4/5 star resort! My in-laws talked up and down about how they weren't interested and they ended up buying into the BlueGreen resorts! The pool's were amazing. We spent most of our time at the larger pool, it was very clean and heated to a comfortable 82 degrees. There were play areas and a splash pad for little ones, and dual water slides for older kids. The little grill at the pool had delicious hamburgers (although pretty overpriced...about $10.00 just for a burger and fries) but it was good none the less. The other pool was a bit smaller and was half indoor half outdoor, there was another kiddie pool there with fountains in it for the kids to play in. Plenty of lounge chairs to lay out at both pools. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. I've recently spent time at a brand new Sandals resort in St. Lucia and the rooms were comparable so I'm not really sure about the reviews that say the rooms are outdated. The entire place was always clean actually. The resort is only a 10-15min. drive to Disney, depending on traffic. It is also minutes away from all of the restaurants and nightlife on International Drive.

The care that is taken to check you in, ensure you have everything you need is something i really like. The only downside is that when you collect your parking pass they like to book owners like us to \"update\" meetings, we refuse and never get pushed in hard. What follows for the rest of your vacation is pure luxury. Two bedroomed apartments, with the most comfortable beds ever ... the master en-suite shower is amazing an wakes you up beautifully every morning. We are lucky enough to have lake front apartments for our time and the bigger apartment which can sleep 8. They have just been remodelled and look amazing.

But we didn't stay March Break before.....What a difference. The last time we stayed it was beautiful and for familes with those beautiful pools and friendly staff. I would venture to say they have new management ! It is a beautiful resort but from the time we showed up to the time we checked out (EARLY) ,it was a stressful vacation. We go away with young kids try to get rest and relaxation. We don't book party resorts or anything where March Break Students overrun the place. By Monday we wanted out. We were put in building 7 which is nothing like building 3 or 4 ,which is what we had booked but they overbooked and lost our confirmation... The units in the other building are smaller and about 500 square feet packed together. This would not be an issue unless you are packed in with March Break teenagers. Security had their hands full and music was cranked everywhere until 1 or 2 am with kids screaming and parties everywhere....Is this a family resort anymore ? No it is a timeshares sales resort now ! They want your money and give away 2 night vacations to everyone to get you here. Our best was when we showed up to book in , they didn't have our reservation. We booked with a timeshare because that is what Bluegreen is. A timeshare resort that wants your money. We actually couldn't get to our unit until the next morning because they didn't have our name on file and never had a room for us. Wonderful ....Twice this week someone lost our reservation.....What is going on ! Hotels overbooking and just putting bodies in rooms and customer service gone. Finally we got our room after standing around for two hours the next morning and managers coming out and saying it is not their fault , it is RCI's fault.....OK ! Do I care ? I have a confirmation in hand and would like my room please. Next comes the, sorry we have to put you here(building 7) because we double booked building 4 and you have no choice. OH GREAT ! Then comes the timeshare presentation push...Ok ! We went because it was supposed to be so different and and an easy experience for $80.00 Visa....BULL ! They sell a points based system and want $60,000 for a week with over $1200.00 maintaince fees....What a joke and it took over 3 hours....AVOID IT ! We had to call Security after midnight about three times because parties where rocking above and beside us....We have little kids who go to bed before 11pm. Security response from Maria at the front desk....I quote \" we cannot control what goes on inside units and banging the floor does not concern us\". Wonderful.....Security was no help at all and the parties continued until 2 am somedays. OK ! maybe without kids ,we would be into it but the kids go full tilt all day and at night we are wiped out ..Between parks and sunshine. Sleep is needed. NOT HERE ! You won't get it . Just be advised ....Beautiful resort but Management is putting bodies in the room for $$$$.. You can tell from the time you get in the door .....All about the money ... The timeshare sales is a joke and they state you could never buy Bluegreen resale ever. Check e-bay........EASY to buy aftermarket. Many people were here on the Bass Pro deal where you come for 3 days and do the timeshare tour.....Give me a break .....

Pools were heated, and clean! I just loved the kiddie area, and so did my 3 year old. We did attend the timeshare presentation which was somewhat pressured, but for the most part was fine! We did get $80 plus a 3 day 2 night certificate for a hotel room which was just fine!

The 2 BR unit was huge..and it appeared it had JUST been remodeled...almost not completely...everything was new: pillows, lights hadn't been plugged in and there were no wall hangings or decorative items. The tv hadn't been set up yet, but my hubs did that. The kitchen was stocked, and the washer/dryer were a huge convenience. The furniture and beds were comfortable. We were there during some of Orlando's worst storms ever...parks closed, roads closed and flooded, traffic lights not working. Still, we never had power loss in our unit. We enjoyed having so much space to spread out since we were trapped inside. The bar-like restaurant in the common area was mediocre at best because of very very slow service each time we ate there. Perhaps because of the storms they had more diners than usual, but still annoying ot wait so long for average food. One of the reasons we stayed here for 6 nts was the advertised kids activities. Unfortunately, activities for the kids were greatly lacking and the team was not very friendly, flexible or knowledgeable...I suspect they had no bad weather back up plan and were expecting kids to be at the pool. When Spring Break season guests are feeling trapped by the weather, be sure to have lots of fun, non-weather dependent fun things ready...how hard would it have been to give the kids some t-shirts or prizes for a few games, or break out the ice cream cones? Crabby workers mean crabby kids. Closing the bar because the indoor pool was closed was also not a wise move. The area was deemed unsafe to swim (which made sense) but safe enough to play games (like bingo) in that area. Still they said the pool bar is closed if the pool is closed. So silly! A drink or two would have made parents more willing to shell out 20's to the kids for arcade games!! lol We are hoping for better weather this time...the accommodations were a great value and the check in staff was great.

Did not like the new style/decorated rooms. The 2nd bedroom is a little smaller. The master has a beautiful shower basically right in the middle fo the bedroom with no way to take a shower in the mornign without waking up your partner. Also no towel bar near the shower! Weird. The light for the shower area illuminates the entire bedroom, also waking your partner unnecessarily. The master bath was HUGE beyond need. The garden tub is in there but not in the main sleeping area as in the old style where you could relax and watch TV or watch TV while the kids bathed. Too bad. Main living area is a little smaller too which was a shame. Not enough room to sit at the dining table as it was too cramped into the space. Still love having the washer and dryer and kitchen was stocked perfectly. We liked the interior access to the room vs. the outside access at our other visits in bldgs. 5 and 2 but would take exterior entrance to get back the other amenities of bigger living space and more sensible master.

The unit I was assigned (Building Three) was just renovated top to bottom including new bamboo floors, ceiling molding, walls, fixtures...everything; nothing went untouched/unreplaced (even the IRONING board)! Granite counters, stainless steel appliances and a glass tile backsplash in the kitchen. Modern fixtures, new neutral colors, three flat screen televisions greet visitors on entrance. Screened balcony off the living area and another balcony off the Masterbedroom, both overlooking Lake Eve and the Seaworld Tower (enjoy viewing the fireworks every night at Seaworld from the Balcony). Large soaking tub replaced the old jacuzzi tubs in the Master baths, separate full shower and water closet. The Guest Bedroom also has a pullout couch to sleep four and private bath. The Livingroom couch also converts to sleep an additional two people for a total of eight people per unit (if needed). Every possible appliance you might need including the instructions for use. There are Security gates to keep the uninvited out, however The Fountains is in a very safe location, away from the heavy traffic on International, but only a few shuttle stops away for all the hub-bub. Lots of activities and amenities on-site to keep guests busy while away from visiting the parks. I did not rent a car, instead took advantage of the I-trolley for a 7-day/$10 pass. It took me everywhere I needed to go when I supplemented it with local shuttle transportation to the parks. Total cost for Christmas week was under $70! The local Publix was walkable, as were a few restaurants. Great Dominican restaurant in the block where the Publix is located, fresh-squeezed orange juice and delicious, flavorful beef dishes. I was allowed in my room early because it was ready and I found the staff very helpful and open. I highly recommend The Fountains and would not hesitate to stay there again. Feel free to email me with any questions. Building Four is currently under renovation, it will be a mirror to the units in Building Three (where I stayed).

We never passed an employee who didn't ask us how our stay was going. There was even a channel on the TV that made the point that their goal was to be rated all 10's on their survey and to contact them about ANYTHING we had concerns about. Their online survey even offered to forward us to TripAdvisor to make a review after we completed the Fountains' survey. Now that's confidence! Pool facitlies were beautiful! Didn't try any of the restaurants but they looked nice. Resort even has an onsite Domino's - so you didn't have to have a pizza delivered from outside the resort.

Tube TV's were beginning to show there age but I understand they are in the process of being replaced by flat screens (2nd bedroom already had one). We'd definitely go back.

Everytime I tried to take a photo someone would step in front before I finished. Waiting lines were all well over an hour - some many hours.

We walked to Subway, Outback, Publix, 7/11 and the Helicopter tours. It's a rather long walk to get out of the resort, but not bad at all. It's a \"gated\" resort, so not just anyone can come through the gates and go there. I like the added security. The pools were the best I've ever seen! They have a huge one in the middle of the property. As big as the resort is, it wasn't crowded at all. The bar is great that is beside the pool and you can charge drinks to your room so you don't have to worry about lugging around your wallet. They have ice cream sundaes on special during a certain time for everyone, for $2. I loved it. Sometimes the bartenders gave them to us free. The only bad thing is, this bar closed early. I want to say by 6:00. h20 was okay. We ate there twice. I didn't love it. The drinks were good and strong though. The heated indoor/outdoor pool was nice. It was also open much later than the big pool. The hot tubs were being used everytime we were there so I can't comment on those. The security guards are AWESOME. When people were getting too rowdy or too drunk, they threw them out. You will not be disappointed in this place! The only bad experience we had had nothing to do with the resort. We ended up having some people in the room above us that had a kid that woke up every single morning around 3AM. They weren't paying attention to him because he was bouncing a basketball for a good two hours every morning. We called security every morning and they went and talked to them. They'd knock it off for a half hour or so then be right back at it. The last night it happened, it woke us up at 3:30 AM and since we had to be at the airport at 6, we just stayed up.

We are Wyndham owners and exchanged for the week here thru RCI. We arrived at 4pm, which is their chrck-in time \"start\". They didn;t get 5 stars from me becasue my room wasn't ready. This to me would be the beginning of off season, the resort could not have been at 30 percent capacity which to me means....be ready for me to check in at 4pm. They told us they would give us a call when the room was ready so off to Publix we went to get our supplies for the week. We returned at 5:30, with out having received a call that our room was ready...but we did get checked in. There apparently is a resort fee of about 11.75 a day that we did not have to pay. We are not owners here, we had exchanged but apparently the fee is only assessed to those who rent independently. You are then sent to Guest Services to pick up your parking pass...and of course be asked to attend a breakfast meeting...remember...this is a timeshare. If you are not interested simply tell them that. We indicated we were not interested and not once the entire week did we receive a phone call or a flyer slipped under our door. We were placed in Bldg 10, on the 3rd floor. If I HAD to find something to complain about it would be the pool view from my balcony was blocked by the tree tops :) Great 2 bed 2 bsth unit with absolutely anything you need. No complaints. The pool area by Bldg 10 was quite large, and becasue it was off season, hundreds of available loungers, tables, chairs and umbrellas. There were cabanas available for rent...we passed on that....it was 2 loungers and a box fan. Cabannas at the Hilton by the Convention Center were filled with furniture, ceiling fans, a flat screen tv and a fridge, fruit, water and a Cabana Boy named Jay. So...again we passed on the Cabanas here. There is a pool bar, a place to order food, temp tattoos, hairbraiding, water slides for the kids, kiddie pool are, DJ, games, and a little store to sell every nice weather related item you forgot. There is a second pool..smaller and heated.. that we visited closer to Bldg 2 also. We decided Bldh 10 was the plae to be...Bldhs 2 and 4 were close to the smaller pool. Looked to me like everyone else needed to walk quite a bit to get to either of these pools. I am not interesed in that with a bunch of bags and kids in tow :) We spent all out time at the pool...we were not here for the Disney experience....Typhoon Lagoon and Downtown Disney were it for us. The days we did go there....boom....4 minute ride, right around the corner. This really is a great location to Disney, the Outlet Malls and every restaurant you can imagine. I get so frustrated when someone leaves a negative review and focuses on the timeshare piece. Guess what folks...this is a timeshare...they will ask you to attend a meeting, owner or not. They are not going to change your sheets everyday or empty your garbage. If you can't handle doing that for a week I would suggest you spend your week in a 1 room hotel room.

Our stay was in connection with attending a timeshare seminar where the owners of the property, BlueGreen, had us attend a 3 hour sales presentation (although they originally told us 90-120 minutes max). The hotel itself is nicely situated, a short drive to all the major attractions (Disney, SeaWorld, Universal, etc) as well as close to shopping and restaurants. The hotel room itself had all the amenities that we both expected and needed for a family with kids - two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen and washer/dryer. Grocery stores were nearby which allowed us to stock up with drinks and food at a fraction of the price we'd pay inside the parks. And served as perfect spot to enjoy breakfast in our rooms as opposed to having to get up and out before breakfast service ended in a restaurant. The ability to do our own wash meant we could pack less items (wash and re wear them) plus doing a couple of loads the day before leaving meant coming home with next to no dirty clothes. Fast and easy to unpack. The grounds were very nice, lots of green space, well manicured, flowing lakes and clean. The pools were outstanding. It was very hot when we were down, but the pools were mini water parks in their own, plus on nights when at the hotel, we swam until the pools closed at 10pm. Our concerns were around our check in and the low level of organization and customer understanding that was applied. When we made the booking over 6 weeks prior to arriving, we advised we wanted both families to be in the same building (believe there were 8-10 five storey buildings in all). We arrived at 4:30, a half hour after 4pm check in, to find both of our families rooms were not ready. With check out time being 10am, we found it surprising that 6 hours later the rooms were still not ready. We were one of MANY families who we saw questioning this situation, we witnessed some families complaining loudly about still waiting for over 2 hours. The check in staff was not rude, but at the same time, not displaying an elevated degree of concern that our rooms weren't ready. They were quite indifferent about the situation, and advised us they'd call us when the room was ready. We left the hotel, only to be called 15 minutes later on our mobile phone to say room was ready. We went back to check in, to find out just one room was ready. We left, 15 minutes later, get call 2nd room is ready. We go back.. but room is in seperate building. Wait another 15 minutes while they fix that. I don't understand why instead of having us run back and forth, they couldn't just give us our room number and keys but advise us the room wouldn't be ready until \"x\" time. Very unorganized and frustrating, especially after just going through a day of traveling. The room itself had all the amenities were wanted, but the furnishings were very out of date. Not dirty, but dated and stale looking. Conversly, the other buildings and sales display rooms were immaculate with new and updated kitchen cabintry, electronics, carpets & tiles and furniture. Example, we had dull pine cabintry, faded countertops and old TVs with the huge backs on them. The sales room had dark rich cabintry, granite countertops and flat panel TVs throughout. Our bathrooms were clean, but all the tubs had huge hard water stains. The water itself was on the smelly side and tasted awful. We had to use bottled water to brush and rinse our teeth. When we told the timeshare people that the room was not as advertised, they told us our building (number 4) was the only building that hadn't yet been updated with new furnishings, but not to worry about our future visits. I told them this was not a strong sales pitch, telling me \"I know the room is not what we promised, but trust us, it will next time\". I advised them they have one chance to sell me, and they blew it. I found it odd they would make this mistake, setting some one up in an old and tired building when you are trying to sell them on their 5 star world wide accommodations, but again attribute it to a young and inexperienced front desk check in staff. Would I return? No. Would I recommend it to others? Yes, but with a warning. not.

We used our time share and booked two rooms. Most upscale resorts have swim up bars for their guest. This one did not. That is not the problem. This resort actually had security guards walking around the pools telling guest they were not allowed to bring drinks in the pool......or near it!!!! They stated your cups had to be 6 feet away. This was not drinks in bottles or glasses. It was plastic cups. To make the drinking environment even worse is the fact that the pool area is huge and they do not have cocktails servers. The pool closed at 11:00pm. We did not have a problem with that either. However we were sitting outside the pool at a table talking. Just talking, 4 adults. They kicked us out of the pool area. NOthing like catering to your guest. Appartently you have to go to bed at 11PM and cant be outside. We are in our 40's and felt like this resort was being runned and had policies of a senior citizen housing complex.

Got an amazing deal (full week and 2x - 7 Day Tickets to Universal Studios) to sit through the 90 MInute sales pitch (they do a tremendous job to sell you a timeshare. Funny how the systems has gone from weeks to a Points system. At the end of the day is all about the kids. Do take your time (you only have 90 minutes) to figure how if you can shell all that dough. When we arrived there from a long drive from New York, the staff was very courteous. Got there early and was able to check into my room within 15 minutes. The room was a bit dated (as were the TV Units, but then again we weren't going to hang too much on the rooms to watch). The A/C worked on 75% of the suite. Had my kids sweating for 2 days out because some how the unit would not vent to their room (check the a/c unit once you check in). The kitchen was okay (had all the utensils and pots needed. We enjoy cooking on our trips). The fridge rattled on and off for a few days (call maintenance for this. funny how it would come back to normal once they showed up) The bathrooms were okay. Warning! when checking in, immediately check the master bath. I had an issue in where a horrible smell was venting from the Master Bathroom's Shower. Ended up turning up the vent fan the whole time i was there till the smell would go away. The bedding. Warning! I strongly suggest to immediately check your bedding. I found the sheets on both the bed to be stained and dirty looking (regardless of whether they smelled nice or not). The hotel area was beautiful. Lots of green and fresh air and clean all over. The pools are the highlights of this place. They have a massive pool (can't recall the name) in where they have a slide (kids of all ages will have a blast with this), as well as a play area. Plenty of beach chairs (and if you dont' want to sit out in the sun there are rental of tents). In addition on the other side of the hotel there is a covered pool (also a portion of it sits outside and it is heated) with a walk up-to bar (good drinks). My family is a tennis family and found it a bit of a downer when we noticed they didn't have a tennis court in the hotel. We were told they had one nearby in another affiliated hotel (which as guests we could use). Drove for 15 minutes to get there and ridiculously it was shared with a basketball court. Every serve and forehand was interrupted by other players in the basketball end. Booooo downer. The hotel was right along International Drive in the event want to take the family walking in the Boulevard. I found to be extremely close to Disney and Universal Studios (10 minutes no traffic) and Also a Publix Supermarket 5 minutes out in case you want to get your groceries.

There was no rhyme or reason for the bars' hours. It appears they didn't schedule staff very well and just closed down. They were not on the same page with resort drink specials. With one bartender, one could get a drink special and then not get the same special from the next person. Isn't it all the same resort? And what is with the wallops bar closing before 8? The pool areas are wonderful, but the slides close at 7. Really? It is summer, and many people get to the resort from the attractions- perfect time for the kids to use the slides.

Hot tubs were nice but they could use 1 more of them at both pools as they were always full. Also, would suggest they get another ping pong table for the indoor/outdoor pool. It would be great if they could come up with another method for using the amenities at the resort. Instead of leaving a cash deposit or leaving your drivers license with an attendent for using ping pong paddles, basketball, etc-- perhaps getting the person's room # or scan their card somehow?? There were lots of planned activities daily at resort.. we didn't participate however.The internet fee of $5/day for using your own laptop was very reasonable compared to some other resorts. Otherwise you can use hotel computers for a fee. We did use theirs to print out our boarding passes. We purchased a $5 card to access our airline and then it's $.75 to print too, but cheaper than printing at airport! We were not impressed with the initial greeting we received upon check-in. The lady at front desk was not personable at all. It was our first visit to The Fountains, where we are owners, thinking we would get some information and a welcome to our resort.. it was rather disappointing. We asked about checking in prior to the 4 pm and she asked if we were aware of check in time? Also, we explained in booking almost a year ahead, we asked about a room overlooking the pool. She was unable to tell us where we might be. We simply didn't get that 5 star resort customer service from this lady.

Our children are 6 and 9, and had a blast swimming and listening to the music and DJ in the afternoons. They had trivia and games that were enjoyable for all ages. They also encourage recycling - which for me is very important. We have stayed at about 10 different resorts in the Orlando area and this was the first one which actually made recycling on the grounds easy, as well in our room. The nighttime activities were also enjoyable. The cons: We are owners who had never stayed at the resort. (Don't expect any perks for becoming an owner, btw..) We circumvented the owner's breakfast pitch pretty easily, and got our room keys right away. BUT, they put us in a room with 2 beds. My kids do not sleep well in the same bed, as I am sure most don't. It took quite a while to move us to another unit, which was in a newer building, (#6) but the floor plan was TINY. We have been in many resorts in the Orlando area, never have we stayed in a unit so small. Not only that, it was filled with very sharp metal furniture. I stopped counting how many scrapes and bruises we got trying to move around each other. To get wi-fi, we had to buy a card for $12/day. This card also got you 2 free small coffees/day, a newspaper, 15% off resort activities/drinks/food, and free local phone calls. When I checked out, I noticed phone calls were billed to our room, so asked to have them removed. SOME calls placed in the Orlando area are free local calls, OTHERS are not, I was told. We were supposed to peruse the manual in our room to figure that out on our own. I thought that was a cheap shot, for the money we paid up front. I was VERY allergic to the sheets on our bed. This has never happened to me before. I had to go to a local walk-in clinic and get a shot of cortisone, followed by a prescription of prendisone. At first, the person my husband spoke to said there was nothing she could do, but when I called back and asked to speak to a supervisor, they jumped into action. Security came and took a statement and photos. They sent a housekeeper over who washed sheets and towels in a laundry soap that we purchased, then she re-made the bed. It was annoying to me to have to turn in pool towel cards to get pool towels, as well as give your ID and a cash deposit on anything you wanted to borrow. (Bean bags for games, etc.) These things take away from the vacation environment and make you feel like they don't trust you. They also upcharged for most activities.

We loved the spaciousness of the 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom suites. We were able to go to the grocery store and pick up breakfast and snacks for the week (being on vacation, I refuse to cook full meals). The quality of the rooms and furnishings were also very high. Huge walk in shower with a separate whirlpool tub in the master bath. We barely used the screened in porch but we did enjoy having it. The grounds of the resort were very nice too and the big pool was gorgeous. Given the choice between an afternoon at the amusement park and an afternoon in the pool both of the older kids picked the pool. We did have a few small issues but I feel that the resort handled them very well. When my daughter's meal came out wrong twice, the kitchen manager came out unsolicited and profusely apologized, got her something different at super speed and gave us $20 in resort bucks to spend during our stay. When one of the kids bumped her head at the pool we went over to the poolisde market and asked for an icebag. Immediately the lifeguard and security people were right there checking on her and I had to fill out and accident report. I thought it was a bit of overkill but they obviously cared and wanted to make sure she was all right. Our one biggest complaint about the resort is that it does not have a dedicated indoor service restaurant. In the clubhouse, up to midafternoon you have to order your food from the snack bar/gift store area and then you can go sit in the lounge to eat. After midafternoon, you order at the bar but then the snackbar'gift store is closed so when I wanted something from the gift shop I had to go to the bar and get someone to come open it up and hover while I quickly looked around. Ther e is also food service at both pools but there you also have to go to the bar to order and then take your food somewhere else to sit down.

The big pool a little cold but had a great bar, great snack food, cool slides and play area for the kids, tons of chairs and space and this is during spring break, massages available and sun and fun music playing. We actually stayed a whole day just at the resort and it was great fun. We like the indoor/outdoor pool area too and the water a bit warmer. Six blocks from Publix, we saved tons on just 3 breakfasts, easy to rationalize staying here vs. Disney property. 5 minutes from Seaworld, 10 from Universal and 15 from Disney if no traffic. On the downside and just trying to be objective, H20 adult bar now combined with kids arcade space, cheapens it, hope they change that. Kids inside play area too small, no one would really stay there long. Staff very friendly but they don't engage to get you involved, you have to show up at the right time and place for activities. By the pool for instance, announce the activity, it's a big pool and we didn't know where you were doing things. Feels like they hope you won't show up, but if you do, they are quite nice and fun activities. Not much to do on a rainy day. No big areas inside for activities which would have been nice. And the light over the kitchen table is ugly. Ok, see, that's petty but really, this is a very nice resort.

We stayed in building 5 on the top floor which I highly recommend for it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view. It looks out over the lake (well I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m from Milwaukee and lake is something a lot bigger to us so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more like a large pond) where they have swan shaped paddle boats and one small pontoon with table and chairs. There is apparently good fishing on this lake which is stocked by the state even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privately owned (so no permit is needed). I heard that an 8lb and an 11lb bass have been caught but there is a sign that you have to throw them back when you catch them. Another nice thing about this building is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very close to the clubhouse where the smaller indoor/outdoor pool is (and sauna & steam room and inside hot tub) and bar and restaurant and the fitness center. We never used the fitness center but it seemed to be quite new and have lots of equipment, both for lifting and for cardio. I would guess there were at least 7 or 8 treadmills, 2 or 3 cross trainers and 2 reclining bikes. We ate at the pool and had a wonderful salad of roasted veggies and chicken. We didn't find this pool to be very noisy at all. The buildings on either side of the clubhouse are the two original buildings and are laid out differently than ours but they seemed very nice from the outside. We never cooked so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything about the kitchen except we did make a frozen pizza and the oven worked and the microwave worked. The 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo with screened in porch was lovely. The couch and loveseat upholstery could have been more comfortable but when we were there we spent most of our time on the porch. It faced the lake and the east so it was cooler at night. It was kind of strange that we had an older TV in the living room and the Master bedroom but a large flat screen in the second bedroom (???). The master bedroom had a large corner tub in the bedroom which I took advantage of and a large shower in the bathroom. Very nice. We spent one day at the large outdoor pool and it was fine. There was pool service and massages available at the cabanas (need cash or credit card). All In all this was a great place and we had fantastic weather. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 20 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 30 minutes from Disney but most everything else is too. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closer to Universal and Seaworld but only by about 10 minutes. It's in the middle between those and Disney.

I went with my husband and son, for our son's birthday and his first trip to Disney World. We got there at 12:00pm, as we only live a few hours away from Orlando. Our room wasn't quite ready, so we walked around the resort, ate at the grill by the main pool and our room was ready by 1:00. Our room was great! And it wasn't even in a renovated building. The absolutely only complaint- the couch was not good, at all, in looks or in comfort. Our son loved that he had his own room with a t.v. We got our things unpacked, which I never do in a regular hotel. I'd brought laundry detergent, dish detergent, etc because I wasn't sure if they would supply it but they did have everything needed. (and I did multiple loads over the weekend; it was nice to come home with clean clothes). We had a great view from the screened in balcony, of the pond and the 3 fountains, palm trees and could just catch a glimpse of Wakoola Springs.Then we went down to Wakoola Springs. It was VERY cold but beautiful! And it was only about 80, 85 degrees outside so we didn't expect it to be very warm. We tried out the heated pool but it wasn't much better as far as warmth but just as nice and my husband and I got in the hottub, while our son swam, 4 feet away from us, in the indoor pasrt of the pool. Our son didn't want to leave the hotel that night or the next day. We did the timeshare tour the first full day and it was fine, except that it took too long and the second set of sales people, not the one who does the initial presentation (he was wonderful), were not great. We were really thinking it over because we loved the Fountains so much but couldn't come up with an amount that would work that day. Their solution- can't you just put it on a credit card? If they would have been more flexible and let us finance some of the down payment too, instead of forking over $2,000, while we're already spending extra on vacation, we would have bought. And they were as nice as could be till my husband finally said, for the 3rd time, \"Look, if we have to pay a large down payment today, we can't do it\" and said it very firmly , then they acted put-off and showed us the door. Oh, well. The 3rd day we went to Magic Kingdom and just had a blast. It was SO nice coming back to a \"condo/ apartment\" and not a one room space with 2 uncomfortable beds and a tiny bathtub with no water pressure. Oh, and the bathtub. We had a garden tub jacuzzi in the master bedroom and then the shower was in the area with the toilet. I've heard some people say they wouldn't like this but our family is very close and our son is still very young so it wasn't a big deal. And he loved \"swimming\" in it every night. He normally hates to get baths but every night there, I had to force him to get out; he was already begging to get in. I have been to Orlando many times, always stayed in a typical hotel room, and I'm sure I will go many more times but I have to say, it's going to be difficult now to stay anywhere else. And its location was great. It is on the quiet part of International Drive, down past the Sea World Entrance and just literally a left turn and right turn away from the Disney Resort. We went to Downtown Disney 2 nights and it took 10 minutes to get there and back. In the weeks leading up to the trip, I was looking up things to do on the day of our timeshare tour because we weren't going to a Park that day but it turns out that we all just wanted to stay right there. I would definitely liked to have had more time at the resort. The game room wasn't all that great but they were renovating part of that building. Around the resort is another pond with paddleboats, though I don't think they were available then. There were also fire pits and charcoal and gas grills set up around the property. We definitely would have grilled out if we had more time. So if you couldn't tell, we just had a wonderful time and the Fountains had a lot to do with that. We still would have had fun but it wouldn't have been the same. We weren't cramped up in a little room with our dirty clothes in trashbags and all our stuff crammed on the little sink, with paper thin towels and wash rags and no fridge to put drinks in. Our son could watch his cartoons and we could watch what we wanted, we had the balcony to go sit on at night and in the morning when we got up, just like at the beach. I've read some people complaining about no maid service. Good grief- stick the towels in the washer when you go to bed, put them in the dryer the next morning, leave out one to use. I did have to wash some clothes, towels and a few dishes but it was different because I was on vacation and not doing it at my own house. My husband didn't even complain about taking out the trash. Everyone who has looked at our pictures has said how nice it looks. Check out was at 10am, which was a little early but no big deal.

Sleeping was very comfortable, with lots of pillows of various firmness. We have 2 small kids, so a 2BR unit with a full kitchen and laundry was great. The huge Wakoola Springs looked like it would be great in better weather. The weather was OK while we there, but that pool is not heated. The other small pool at the Clubhouse is heated and has indoor and outdoor sections. Given we had a couple real cool days, we were really glad to have the indoor option. The indoor pool area and pool area bathrooms were not perfectly clean, but with an indorr/outdoor area, you kind of expect that. There were great kids activities, some requiring fees, but those fees were very reasonable. The grounds are well maintained, and we used the two toddler playgrounds. The Fountains is easy to get to from the airport, very close to Sea World, and about 15 mintues from Disney.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Garden Grove, California", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful place to relax, beautiful location and lovely pools\u201d", "Author": "JennieR_11", "ReviewID": "UR95612137", "Content": "We were very satisfied with the accomodations.

One thing is for sure, the price is way too high for what you get!!! I called a couple days prior to our stay to add an additional night & the lady I spoke w/ made it seem like it would not be a problem to do so. Upon check in, the guy at the desk acted like we were putting him out just by being there. Our reservations were all messed up & it took almost 20 minutes to get checked in. He was not apologetic or nice to us at all. Then they asked us if we wanted to watch a time share presentation & acted really offended when my husband told them that we were not interested at all. This place was supposedly built in 2005, but it seems older than that like mabe mid 90's. I had requested a renovated unit when I made the reservation...we think we got a renovated unit, but it appeared they cut corners b/c the TVs & appliances were old & the furnishings looked cheap. In fact, the fridge kept making some loud noises the whole time. The only thing we noticed that seemed new was the granite countertops. The luggage carts are limited for each building. The fire alarms & security alarms kept going off in our building and others. Their was a deceptive \"resort fee\" charged each day during our stay, which included internet access, which was the worst, slowest connection we have ever experienced anywhere. The master bathroom started smelling really musty & moldy a few days after we got there & we noticed that the toilet had mold all inside the rim. Their is no housekeeping, not unless you want to spend $25 a day extra. You have to take your own trash out too & they only give you limited supplies. There were annoying phone messages every day from the staff. The bigger pool (Wakoola Springs) was not heated & the pool bar was not open the entire time we were there. We did not get to use that pool (which was the better of the two). The smaller one by the lake was heated, but it was crowded & cold once you got out. They have outdoor grills around the man made lake area, but the ingition switches did not work. There are no fitted sheets on the beds, so they kept coming off every night. The couches in the living area are extrememly uncomfortable & worse than sitting in a dr's office. Our key card to our unit stopped working the last night of our stay. The security guy came to assist, but he had no personality or customer service skills whatsoever. He made us wait a while before he got there too & never apologized or explained why this happened. Instead of offering to bring us new cards, he told us we would have to go down to the front office to get new keys.We have never stayed at a Blue Green Resort before & this will definitely be our last.

Upon arrival we were immediately greeted by the front desk with a warm welcome and a smile. Check in went smooth and quick and we were off to our room within 5 minutes. Also, the lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and we were told about specific activities that week just for Christmas. Our room was spacious and clean. 2 bedrooms and 2 baths-the master had a huge tub, king bed, private bath and door leading to a screened patio that overlooked Wakoola Springs pool. the guest bedroom had 2 beds and a private bath as well. both rooms had plush beds that were very comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked, with a full size fridge, stove, dishwasher, washer and dryer and microwave. There was a breakfast bar with barstools and dining room table for 4. The living room also had a pullout sofa that the boys fell alseep on nightly watching movies on the dvd player. It was very cold this week but that didnt keep 2 six year old boys form enjoying the pools. At night they swam in the heated indoor/outdoor pool and during the day, despite 50 degree weather, they LOVED the slides at wakoola!!! A special treat was an evening activity where Mr and Mrs Claus read stories and served cookies with warm apple cider. They provided paper for the boys to write their christmas lists and give to Santa- I couldnt resist either and we did a family photo with santa and the Mrs!! Another great activity and my favorite was the bonfire. We missed the smores and singalong they do on Sundays but were able to enjoy a weenie roast on wednesday. very relaxing and the fire was perfect to fight the chilly weather. They also just opened their fitness center which was under constuction my last visit and it was amazing!! top of the line equipment with nice tvs on all machines, weight machines, ab worker and even a Yoga/pilates studio. There is a publix grocery store just minutes away, along with the premium outlets. Checkout was a breeze! Only a few people in line and at checkout they offered us an ipad to fill out a comment card! Very cool i thought and a great way to try out an ipad before buying one. We have passes for aquatica and looking forward to warm weather and another great stay here.

There were dishwasher tablets, washing powder, washing up liquid and coffee and was pleased to see a recycling bag for paper and cans (although when i had a clean halfway through my stay - the cleaners put the dishwasher on for 1 plate a cup and a couple of pieces of cutlery which i thought was a waste of energy!!). The safe was big and held everything we had brought, and there was plenty of storage space. However the room where you put the trash was very dirty,and smelly.

My son of 13 and his friend - did the xbox tournemant and the dive in movies and they really enjoyed those, and there were barbecues around the resort which we saw lots of people using, there were also free computers in the club house - that you could use for 30 mins - never had to wait for these and got to check emails daily. We didnt eat on site so i cant comment on this - there is a publix nearby and a walgreens and a few minutes drive is the premium outlets, there is a trolly stop outside it you dont feel like driving - we used this when going to seaworld (as the kids go free) only a few stops and saved on the parking. I did like the driving directions which i found in my welcome pack they were very useful (even though been many times before - and dont take a sat nav - with these found a few short cuts that i didnt know about).

We were also told that the Universal tickets were not good at Islands of Adventure (the only reason we went to Orlando) but that the two day passes at Universal could be traded for one day passes at I of A. Once we got to Islands of Adventure, we were told that, no, the passes could not be traded in, but we could upgrade to two-day, two-park passes at a cost of $150. Wonderful.

The condo was updated, clean, and very comfortable. Everything you could possible need for an extended stay was provided right down to soap for the dishwasher and laundry detergent! They even gave a courtesy call in the evening to ask if we needed anything and if we were enjoying our stay! My toddler was able to watch her DVD's while the hubbs and I relaxed on the screened patio, it was very relaxing. My husband enjoyed the jetted tub when his back began cramping :-) The outdoor pool was a vision and very clean! It was oversized, so it never felt crowded. You could order food and drink right on the pool deck, although we prepared all of our meals in the condo. There were waterslides and a spray park attraction for the kiddies to enjoy. I thought that was great since it kept the energized kids and family-types pretty separate from the honeymooners and solo vacationers. Here's the drawback... the timeshare tour was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long!!! Did I mention that I have a 3-year-old?? They put a large group of us in a room for a presentation that lasted TWO HOURS!! The paperwork stated that the presentation would last 90-120 mins. so we were relieved to get out of that room when the 120 mins. were up! BUT THEN, they separated us into families to meet privately with a consultant who gave us a tour of the pres. suites. THEN they wanted us to meet with a financial consultant to crunch all of the numbers and go over the cost of the timeshare!! By this time, we had been there for 2 1/2 hours and our 3-year-old was crying, \"I'm hungry!\" I had to cut the woman off, apologize for having to leave, and we left. My husband and I were actually open to the idea of owning, but after being stuck in a room for 2 hours, we had no desire to stay and find out the cost. Bluegreen should SERIOUSLY cut the presentation waaaay down so that potential owners have enough patience to meet with the consultants! We only had ONE full day at the resort, and we had to go to Magic Kingdom all in ONE afternoon, so we just COULDN't spend all day in a sales presentation! That is my only complaint about Bluegreen.

I cannot BELIEVE we didn't find this resort before now. I believe it was recently bought from another company, but everything is up to date, as if it were just built within the last year or two. There are several other vacation ownership type resorts, brand names, big names, and to be honest.....they are all OLD. A lot of the Disney area resorts have amenities galore, but there's nothing worse than an old, smelly room, with grandma's floral wicker furniture from the 80's. I cannot tell enough friends about The Fountains! For the investment you make into taking a family on a week vacation, or just in general to that area, there is nothing in comparison. The property is huge! There is a lake with paddle boats, fishing and everything. And they have it organized perfectly so that the big, main pool is open for all guests exactly when it needs to be. Then, the other clubhouse pool that is a not as large, but indoor/outdoor, stays open later at night. They have everything from grills, to swings/hammocks, game rooms, fire pits, I could go on and on. I was MOST impressed with the activities. We've all seen finger paint day, or water balloon day.....but not here....they have a LIVE alligator show, live DJ with Bingo going for the whole pool, there is a waterslide that my kids stayed on forever, airbrush tattoos, exotic bird shows, ice cream socials where you can build it exactly how you want it. Believe me, it's not your typical activities schedule. They have all kinds of exercise classes, water fitness, etc. I truly cannot think of a thing they missed. The rooms are astonishing. I read some of the reviews and I think they must have posted their negative comments on the wrong resort. You walk in to all updated/new furniture. Dark woods, modern lighting, and the two bedroom that we stayed in was HUGE! The kitchen was full size, 3 flat screen tv's, balcony, washer/dryer, pull out sofa in living room and a full size glass dining table, where you could serve a meal, rather than just pull up a chair to the kitchen counter. Speaking of food.....again, wow! The pool menu was incredible and the kids menu was the best selection I've ever seen. I've always wondered why they all have the same thing, but here they had at least 8 things to choose from, and my kids were so excited. I doubt we'll ever look for another place to stay, because it was such a different experience, and it made the vacation so comfortable. You will not be disappointed!

Check in was painless (clerk was so-so in the friendly category), declined the offer to sit through the timeshare meeting that they say will be only be 90 min because the last time we attended it it lasted 2 1/2 hrs, received our keys and proceeded to our villa in building 10! Once again, we were thrilled with everything about our accomodations! Place is very large, bedrooms very large, fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, 2 bathrooms, and 3 t.v.s. We did not pay for housekeeping so I ran the sweeper a couple times during the week and that was fine! We requested clean towels quite a few times and they arrived in about 30 minutes. Maintenance dept. was GREAT.....our washing machine broke and it was replaced within 20 minutes, we requested a few new lightbulbs when a couple burnt out and they arrived within 10 minutes. Within 30 minutes of any maintenance calls we received a follow up call asking if our issues had been solved....super customer service! I had a few random questions that I called to the front desk for answers for and more than once they couldn't answer them but connected me with other departments and they also couldn't answer them so customer service in that area wasn't the greatest. We used the fantastic Wakoola Pool (with 2 waterslides) everyday and found it to be in perfect condition each day. Food at the bar was excellent and very fairly priced. They do add a 15% gratuity to your bill but that is advertised so it is not a \"hidden\" charge. Also, we used the other indoor/outdoor pool a couple times after the Wakoola Pool closed and it was nice too but we liked Wakoola better! The indoor/outdoor pool also has a bar and you can order food. Parking was never an issue and 3 of the nights we were there the place was sold out. The Wakoola Pool had either a d.j. or kids activities going on each day which was perfect since we were there with 2 11 year olds and 1 8 year old. The very worst thing about the resort is the workout room! 2 treadmills, 2 stationary bikes, Natulis weight set and a few free weights just does not even come close to being suitable for the amount of units that is in this complex. Square footage in the so called workout room is no more than 250 sq. ft. HORRIBLE! There are a few people we would like to personally mention. First .... Ricky who worked the Wakoola Pool taking food and drink orders was FABULOUS. This guy worked so hard and gave perfect service with a smile! He didn't just serve people....he made each guest feel special! Second.....Roy who worked around the pool area too doing a little bit of everything was a special guy. I got to talk to him at length after he helped me try to find my innertube that was left the day before at the pool when the pool area was cleared quickly because of a lightning strike close to the area. He went above and beyond the \"call of duty\" asking alot of the employees if they had seen the innertube and actually took me around personally before the pool area even opened for the day to look for it! He's a very interesting man and I could have talked to him all day every day I was there! (Roy...hope your grandson has/had a great first day of school!) And last but certainly not least is Lee in the reservation department. This guy truly knows what giving good customer service is all about. We had to change our reservations more than once after making our initial reservations months ago because of airline problems and no matter how many times I called him he was always friendly, professional and extremely helpful in all areas of customer service. We were fortunate enough to be able to meet him while we were at the Fountains and even though the meeting was brief we could tell he is just a \"class act\"! So to everyone at the Fountains, especially the 3 fantastic employees we just highlighted, thank you very much for a superb stay and we hope to stay at the resort again!

The pool looks lovely until it gets hot, there is no shade whatsoever and if you want shade you have to pay for a shelter at an extortionate price. The male lifeguard was more interested in flirting with the female lifeguard than doing his job. Pool activities were just embarrassing for the resort and knowing that money you paid for your holiday goes towards hiring these people makes me mad. The food on the resort is disgusting and you aren't allowed to take your own near the pool area nor are you allowed to take your own drinks or cooler boxes, you are expected to buy silly cocktails and there isn't much of a choice for children. The shop is pointless, they sell a bottle of fiji water for $5 a bottle, supermarket price $1.08.

The husband, two children (7 & 12) and myself enjoyed a brilliant two week stay in The Bluegreen Fountains resort in Orlando. Located at the quiet end of International Drive, The Fountains has so much going for it. The I-Ride Trolley stops right outside (no 39), and for just $10 for 7 days you have the perfect transport system to ferry you to some of the major attractions, including SeaWorld, Aquatica, Wet N Wild, Universal (10 min walk from the I-Ride stop), not to mention loads of places to play, see and eat out along International Drive. The best thing about the I-Ride is that because The Fountain's stop is one of the first heading North up International Drive, you always get a seat! A complete journey along Int. Dr takes about one hour, depending on traffic. The Lynx Bus (8 & 42) also stops right out the front of the Resort, providing transport to the likes of Downtown Orlando and The Orlando International Airport. A taxi to Downtown Disney cost $16 including tip, and if you get the chance see Cirque Di Soleil do go as it was fantastic!! The Fountains itself is a beautiful resort, with beautifully kept lawns and lakes, and two wonderful pool areas each with their own outstanding features. The Wakoola Springs is the newest of the two and has loads of activities organised throughout the day to keep all ages amused. The pool itself is gorgeous and has 2 small waterslides for the kids. The Wakoola Grill serves food and drinks all day ( the burgers are lovely) and for $3 you can create your own ice cream sundae at certain times of the day! My two loved that! The other pool is located at the Clubhouse, and although it is not as big as the Wakoola Springs, half of it is indoors (much appreciated during the 94 degree heat!) and as it is situated next the Lake Eve, it is a lovely place to drink your cocktails, especially at sunset. Both pools were open till late, Wakoola until 10pm and the Clubhouse one until 11pm. The Clubhouse also has internet facilities (free), art and crafts room for the kids, an arcade, H20 Bar (food served aswell) and a very small gym. Our 2 bed apartment was immaculate! Everything you could want and more. We stayed in building 8 and LOVED everything about it. There was a TV with cable in each room, a DVD player, stereo, washer/dryer, dishwasher, everything you need for cooking (not that I did much). Other reviewers for this property have commented that you had to pay for room cleaning, however, as we were staying for 2 weeks our room was cleaned for us each week free of charge and linen was replaced anytime we needed it. The service was brilliant too! A hotplate on our stovetop didn't work, so on passing the reception I dropped in and mentioned it, and before we had even reached our apartment a repairmen had been called and was fixing the problem as we arrived! Now that's service!! The Fountains is a timeshare resort, and if you want to take advantage of their discounted tickets, you can sit through a sales pitch, but there was absolutely no pressure to do so. In fact, I think we may have dodged that one completely as we weren't even asked let alone hassled to attend a sales breakfast. All in all, after buying tickets for theme parks, dinner shows, day outings and various attractions, Orlando can be a REALLY expensive place to visit. So it was nice to be able to enjoy some down time in a beautiful location in the comfort of your own apartment while eating homecooked food. I know my family appreciated it!

Now if this was a hotel I would understand, but it is a SELF CATERING resort and in the last 8 years I have never had a problem with this issue in any other resort I`ve stayed in. One evening, my son cut his ankle bone off a 4 inch piece of jagged metal protruding from the base of his bed. We patched him up as best we could and I wrapped a towel around the offending item to prevent further injury. I phoned the front desk the next morning and reported the incident to the duty manager. He promptly sent up 2 men to our unit. The 1st man to arrive took pictures of the area and I filled out an \"Incident Report Form\" The 2nd man was from maintenance and he fixed the metal bar by attaching a cover to it which had been left off. He explained that the bars were used to hold the baseboard of the bed in place. Neither of these men, despite seeing that the bedsheets were bloodstained, offered to send up housekeeping to change them. At this time I asked the 1st man for a copy of the \"Incident Report Form\" and he said he would have it for me in a day or two. On the night before we checked out I rang the duty manager and requested a copy again to be ready at the front desk the next morning. My main issues with the management of this resort are as follows: (1) Following my son`s accident, nobody from management rang the unit at any time to see how he was. (2) On the morning we checked out, the requested form was \"lost\" and despite my protestations I never once came eye to eye with a manager. They seemed very happy to send their staff out to try and deal with the situation. (3) I was told that the manager would forward a copy of the report to me by post and as of today`s date ( 3rd Aug ) I still have not received it.

I felt like we were not a priority since we purchased through Bass Pro for a lesser price. Our villa consisted of a kitchen, living area, two bathrooms, two bedrooms, and a screened in balcony. It was not anything special but it sufficed since we were only in the room morning and late night. Our ice machine, balcony fan, and coffee maker was broken. (Ice machine was fixed the next day and a new coffee pot sat in a box on our stove.) The tvs in three rooms were quite small and old school. Also the reception was poor on some channels. Other guests and the resort told us that they had flat screens in their villas. It was just a plain and simple villa, nothing impressive. Yes, we paid less than others so I guess you get what you pay for. We knew that going into it. Our time share presentation went alright. My husband and I knew going in that we did not want to purchase; however, we listened to the presentation, spoke only when necessary, and gave conservative answers. Manny, our time share guy, grew frustrated because our answers were not what he wanted to hear. We told him that we weren't interested and that was it. It only lasted about 90 minutes, if that. We watched the clock, and it was pretty painless. This was our first time share. The outdoor pool was nice. My three year old was able to do the waterslide. Height requirements are 42 inches. The indoor pool is quite small. We never had time to swim in it or partake in any of the activities. Floridays Resort is right next door and their suites are ten times better.

We discussed the issues that surfaced during my visit. She said that she had been out of the office for the last month, but wanted to see what she could do to correct the situation. She promised to call me back, but I did not ever hear from her, so now I am even more disappointed than before. My original review is below.) This is the second time I have stayed at this resort, both times through an RCI exchange. The first time we stayed at this resort (in 2009), there was good reliable internet service in the room (although there is a $35 charge and it is dial-up disguised as broadband, so you have to physically hook up to the connection in the living room), and free wi-fi at the clubhouse and pool. Therefore, when I booked the resort this time, I had no reason to think anything had changed, and there was no information to indicate any change. However, when I paid through a third-party provider (lodgenet) for internet access, the service was AVERAGING 80 mbps. I had work that had to be completed Saturday evening. I called the front desk and they transferred me to the internet provider who said \"yep, your service is very slow.\" They claimed that someone else was using an unusually large portion of the bandwidth and they said they would kick that person off. I went back to trying to work and the service was not any faster, so I realized that I would have to leave the resort and find the nearest place with free wi-fi. I was pretty frustrated at this point because I had wasted six hours of my day and it was now going on 7 pm. I stopped by the front desk to talk to a manager about the situation. The clerk at the front desk said she would get a supervisor. I waited 10 minutes (there were no other guests waiting), and asked if she was going to come out. I was told \"yes\" in a snotty manner by the clerk who then left the counter. I waited another 5 minutes and still no supervisor. I asked the remaining clerk who the supervisor on duty was. I was told her name was Ellen. I told the clerk to tell Ellen that I would be back to talk to the manager. I then asked where the nearest place with fee wi-fi was, and the clerk mentioned McDonald's, so I drove there and finished my work. The next day I decided to try the internet in the room again since I had already paid for 6 days. Same deal...very, very slow. I called the front desk again to ask about getting a refund. I was again transferred to the third-party provider who made me go through the whole process again of testing the network speed just to verify that it was not running at the network minimum of 256 mbps so I asked about a refund. I was told the front desk would handle it. So I had to call the front desk again and ask for a refund, which I did receive, but I paid with a credit card and the refund was added to the credit card on my room, which was a different card. This was just the first day...the second day at the resort, we went to the pool by the clubhouse and around 6 pm when we decided to leave, we asked for towels, and were told there would not be any towels for 20 minutes, so we waited and went back up in 20 minutes. This time we were told it would be another 10 minutes, so again we waited. The third time, we were told there was no estimate on when towels would be available so we had to walk back to our room on the other side of the resort soaking wet. The evening of the second day (around 11 pm), we noticed the ceiling above the shower in the master bedroom was dripping and the ceiling was soaked and bulging. I called the front desk and said we needed maintenance to come up immediately. I was told they would be right up...30 minutes later, no maintenance had shown up. I called the front desk again and spoke with someone who had just come in and they did not show that maintenance had been requested for our room, so they sent someone up, and they showed up in about five minutes. They thought they knew the problem (drain leaking from upstairs unit), but could not go into unit upstairs until in the morning because no one answered when they knocked. We asked for another room and were told it would not be a problem to switch rooms. In the morning, maintenance came and said the problem was fixed, so we decided not to go through the hassle of changing rooms. On the fourth day, the ceiling started dripping again, so we called maintenance again. They spent about four hours making repairs (during which time we felt like we needed to stay in the room), and completely tore down and rebuilt the ceiling. They again offered to move us, but we opted to stay. The maintenance men were very apologetic and came in and did the work as quickly as possible and made every effort to accommodate us. I made a call to the manager regarding all of the problems we had during the week. She told me there was a note included in our welcome information about the internet (the information said there were internet problems in building 10 and we were in building 7). She then said they have four computers in the lobby for guests to use any time. I asked why no one told me this when I made call after call about the problems I was having with the internet and why no one told me about the computers when I was asking for the closes place with wi-fi? She said it sounded like a training issue, and she would address it. She offered to give me a credit of $50 for our trouble, which I thought was a little low based on the issues we had, but I decided not to argue because I could tell English was not her first language and she had trouble communicating (yes, this was a supervisor). Based on my most recent visit, I will not book at this resort again in the future. The pools are nice, but the food available at the pools is pretty bad, even for pool food. The resort was very clean, including the pools, and there are activities planned at the large pool for kids and adults in addition to a DJ. The room was nicely decorated, very roomy and had been updated recently, so we did enjoy the room. We expected the room to be cleaned once during the week, which has happened at every other timeshare I have stayed at, but no one ever came to clean. When I asked the supervisor about it, she said if you are an RCI member you can get your room cleaned for no charge, but you HAVE TO CALL AND REQUEST IT. Where was that in the \"welcome Information?\" If you are not an RCI member, there is a $25 charge to clean the room. I waited a week after we left the resort to complete my review because I didn't want to be raging mad. I think all of the issues I had could have been addressed and resolved to our satisfaction if the front desk staff had shown an interest in our problems instead of just trying to pass us off to someone else or get rid of us as quickly as possible. We never felt like we were important to the front desk staff and that is not a good feeling.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cIt was our first time and we would come back(:\u201d", "Author": "Vacations01", "ReviewID": "UR68987812", "Content": "We decided to drive to Florida which was definetly a bad desicion.

As an avid tripadvisor fan I always read reviews before I go somewhere and was very happy with my stay here. I think some people are just hard to please because our stay was nothing short of perfect! The Location was on South International Dr, but on the less crowded section so it was easy access to everything and we didn't have to deal with I-Drive traffic. There was a grocery store very close along with many restaurants to chose from. Oh and tons of shopping! Our check in was smooth and the staff was very friendly. The desk clerk was very friendly, gave us a map of the resort, showed us where everything was. We got there around 4:15 which is right when check in starts and it seemed everyone else had the same idea. Which was to be expected since the place is so big! There were a few families in front of me but the line moved quickly. The resort even had live music at checkin and a special check in just for kids!! Next time I will go have dinner first to avoid the line and would suggest to not come at 4!! Once we got to the room, it was perfect!! I loved the fact that the kitchen was fully stocked which allowed us to cook dinner in the room rather than eat out all the time. The resort even has BBQ grills which we used and was close by our building. We ate dinner on our balcony which even had a ceiling fan. The room also had a washer and dryer which was great to dry our bathing suits. We found all these little perks to be great. The resort itself is a timeshare based resort, so dont expect them to come and clean up after you!! They WILL however bring you fresh towels and linen so that is a big help. The bed was super comfy too and so were the pillows. At fist site I thought the white duvet would be too thin since I'm spoiled by my own plush down comforter, but it was very soft and slept like a baby!! We spent time at both pools and found both to have their perks. Wakoola Springs is the newest pool and is a smaller version of a water park. It's Huge with 2 twirly water slides and 2 kid areas. There were cabanas which you could rent and very reasonable in prices and during the hot summer could be helpful. It seemed like there was always some sort of activity going on too. there was even a band at the pool! The other pool was at the clubhouse and was both indoor and outdoor that overlooked a long dock that you can even fish of off. There was an area that they do bonfires on certain nights, paddle boats, basketball courts,, you name it they had it!! We were overwhelmed with so much going on. This pool even had what they called a \"Dive In movie\" How cute!! It was a huge screen where you can float in the pool and watch a movie. We had drinks from both bars, both at the indoor outdoor pool and Wakoola Grill and they were yummy and refreshing (frozen mango margaritas!). The price was reasonable too. We didn't eat anything here besides some nachos which was massive by the way, to tide us over til dinner. We did meet some people there who said they tried the food on 2 nights and they enjoyed it. We were right near the clubhouse so I went there to use their computers. I didn't bring my laptop since this was suppose to be relaxing but found the free ones they offered served their purpose. They do offer it in the room at a small fee which I found is the norm for upper scale palces. I saw that some of the posts where people were upset about the resort charging for every little thing and if you are looking for everything free, go stay at a value hotel where you get all that for free but I guarantee it will be nothing in camparison of all the other free ammenities and ambiance you will experience here!!! Also noticed where people complained about the sales staff, but we were never bothered by them. Just wanted to pass that long so dont let that scare you away. Check out was a breeze! We checked our balance on the TV in our room then just dropped the keys in a box. This resort was so nice and we can't wait to go back!

You could quite comfortably fit a party of 5 within them and not feel squeezed for space. During our stay only 2 pools were available, there may be more now, which were of a more than decent size and never overcrowded. Its worth noting that whilst this hotel is located on International Drive, it is at the very southern end and is therefore not within easy walking distance to the main attactions and resturants of the Drive. This may be a positive thing for some and a negative for others depending on your perspective. In summary, a great resort that should be even better now that is completed.

After reading the tripadvisor comments by some, I was a little skeptical about staying. I must say all those who had horrible things to say, we absolutely wrong. First, the pictures do no justice to how beautiful the resort actually is. There are so many different things to do there. Check in was 5 minutes. They originally assigned us to bldg. 3 but I told them I wanted to stay in the newer building 10. Without any hesitation, they switched the room. Everyone we came in contact with at the resort were nice. If they saw us coming they would open doors, or hold the elevator or anything to show appreciation for being a guest there. The room was so clean it looked unused. Everything you need is there. It is like staying \"home away from home\". The pool area and Wakoola Springs were awesome. Workers are outside everyday keeping the grounds looking good. We even went over to the other pool near the clubhouse from time to time. We played in the arcade. My husband and I dined right next door at Benihana restaurant, which was wonderful and walking distance. There is a Domino's pizza in the building. Publix, outlet stores, and other dining places are right down the street. Walmart is not that far. We were only minutes to Universal Studios and downtown Orlando. We had a wonderful time and I am already getting ready to plan for next year. People also have to remember, this is NOT a hotel. This is a resort.

Room was decorated nicely, granite countertops throughout, comfy beds, roomy, great screened in balcony, very very pleased with the room. Amenities of the resort were great. They had so much to do on site, you never need to leave. Gigantic pool area with a big 2 sided slide, a splash area for the kids, a hot tub, grill/bar, volleyball pole, cute canopy bikes you can rent to ride around the lake. Tented cabanas around the pool you could rent for the day. A long list of activities every single day something different for the kids to do. Live DJ and games at the main pool in the afternoon - nice mix of music. Hundreds of lounge chairs. One day we got to the pool in the busiest time of day and we still found chairs. Pool has nice shape, almost like a clover, so you don't feel like you are on top of everyone. Massage tent at pool, so much I can't list it all. Clubhouse was very nice also, indoor/outdoor pool. Swim up bar, coffee shop, restaurant w. large screen TV with all sorts of arcade games throughout, pool table, game room, playground, (as well as others throughout the property). Location was GREAT. 10 min ride to Disney, 5 min ride to SeaWorld. Plenty of stores close by (Publix, Walgreens, Strip mall w. Chinese Takeout, Subway, etc). This is a timeshare resort and I knew that going into it. I had even emailed a few trip advisor members asking them about it and they informed me that they don't pressure you. They ask you if you want to attend, tell you what discounts you can get for attending and you can simply say no. I chose to sit through the presentation for the Disney Discount tickets. The discount was worth it, although my ONLY complaint is that the lady at the service desk told us is was only 90 min and they serve you breakfast. Well, it was not 90 min. In total, from the Bkfst, to the presentation, to the Property Tour to the follow up sit down w. the Sales person - 4 HOURS. Arrived at 8:30am and didn't walk away until 12:30pm. So beware. I should have known better when she said 90 min. 90 min didn't include the Property Tour and high pressure sales tactics at the end. All in all, we resolved ourselves with the fact that the sacrifice was worth the money we saved on the tickets. For what we bought, we saved about $275 Overall, the Resort exceeded our expectations, it was beautifully kept and a wonderful family friendly place to stay. I would stay here again. It was very conveniently located to everything. There was enough to do at the resort to keep your kids busy all day long. Hoola Hoop contests at the pool, swimming races, etc all sorts of stuff and even trivia games for adults. They reward you with a free ice cream sundae or a free drink or appetizer from the bar. It was really really nice. We had a two bedroom villa w. the full kitchen, laundry closet w. washer/dryer, two bathrooms, dining area, living area w. pull out couch and the master bedroom had a large garden tub/jacuzzi. I loved having breakfast on the screened in balcony with my family in the mornings with the ceiling fan on over us creating a nice breeze. Each room had a ceiling fan. The lighting was a bit dim/dull in the Bathroom and Dining area but the kitchen had plenty of light. Water pressure was low in the showers, but I find that I'm never satisfied with that in any hotel. I assume they have special fixtures that reduce it. I am used to my home where I have a powerful shower head. Washer/Dryer was nice and big capacity. The kitchen is fully stocked with everything you could need from wine glasses to potato peeler to cheese grater, to pots, pans, pyrex dishes, measuring cups etc. The only thing we forgot was Salt and Pepper : ) We brought some stuff from home that we already had (like coffee and filters and condiments etc) and then just went to Publix to get what food we needed for the week. There is a fee for housekeeping, which we did not pay for. No need, we simply threw our linens in the wash ourselves. But I believe it's optional. Internet is also a fee. I chose not to get it, the point of my vacation was to stay off the computer and spend time with my family. We have a 4 year old and what did come in handy was the DVD player and CD player right in the Villa for the times we were not out and about. As in all hotels, you can rent video games (they provide the controller) and you can rent movies etc. The TVs left a little to be desired (suggest they upgrade to Flat Panel).

Our room was very spacious and it was nice having a full size kitchen (complete with dishes and dishwasher) and washer and dryer there. It was like we were staying home away from home. The Fountains are located on International Drive, which is one of the main streets in Orlando so it was easy for us to find all of the places we wanted to go. The hotel was conveinent to a Publix so we cooked a couple of times and it was also close to several restaurants. The hotel staff was very friendly and they hosted fun activities for us. I will say that most of the activities costed a few dollars per person so if you choose to participate in everything, you may end up spending $50-100, especially if you have children. My fiance and I didn't attend the time share presentation but our family members did and the presentaion only lasted two hours or so.

At first we were a little weary after reading a few of the negative reviews but we could not have been happier with our choice. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa on the top floor, jetted tub in master was great to jump in and relax after kids went to bed and long days at parks, own private balcony with table & chairs was great to get up in morning and have coffee & breakfast at, building was close to the pool for little walking and no noise at all from neighbors or pool goers. Before booking the room we let the reservation person know we are avid TripAdvisor.com readers and were hesitant to book after reading a few negative reviews. They put us in a newer building with all updated decor and by booking directly with them stayed for only $116/night ($130 after FL tax). I truly believe by mentioning Trip Advisor it almost guaranteed us a better bldg & room because they obviously don't want the bad \"press\" through negative feedback. He did let us know we would be asked to do a timeshare presentation but it was only optional and we could say no. We were only called on the first morning and respectfully declined with no pressure at all and no follow up calls the rest of our stay. Staff was friendly, resort amenities were all great. TIPS: Their big pool with really fun mini water park is only open til 9 pm so I would request to stay in Bldg. (if updated interior) closer to the clubhouse which that pool & jacuzzi is open til 11 pm and Bar, game room, sauna, gym are there (Building 2 I believe is the best geographically situated). They have fun daily family & kids activities to do which is posted daily in all elevators. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too many pool towel cards than you need because in the fine print if you lose them they charge you $10 for each loss card (charge is understandably because they have to assume you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return a pool towel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good tip to know though before getting 5 like we did and handing them out to all your little ones \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we caught that early tidbit early and held on to the cards ourselves). We only stayed 5 nights and then moved to a 3 bedroom vacation home in a more popular resort community. The privacy of renting our own home and ability to come home late from parks and jump in your own pool and jacuzzi was great but that's about all it had on the Fountains. And the home rate which started at $138/night but quickly rose to $200/night after $40/day pool heating fee and mandatory $65 cleaning fee and 13% tax rate vs. only $130 (Fountains rate) we wished we stayed at the Fountains the whole trip. I must say after doing a lot of due diligence and reading a lot of positive & negative reviews from all resorts in the Orlando area there are just people out there who will never be satisfied or justifiably may have just had bad experiences but this was far from our case. If we ever return to Orlando, we will definitely stay at the Fountains and not just recommend it but strongly encourage any family & friends who are heading to Orlando to stay there.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "crystal lake, illinois", "Title": "\u201cKids cried when we left\u201d", "Author": "Jen2328", "ReviewID": "UR64375797", "Content": "Usually when we do \"Disney\" vacations we come home more exhausted than when we left. We decided up front, from seeing the pictures of the pool complex, we would spend a significant amount of time at the resort this time. Theme park one day, resort day the next, and so on for a week. Honestly, the kids could have spent everyday at the resort, and skipped Mickey Mouse completely. The pool is huge, kids activities from 12-4, then again from 7-9, waterslides - kids paradise. Fun for them, relaxing for the parents! That's what vacation is all about, right? Not running your kids ragged until midnight every night in the FL day heat - Then wonder why they are crabby. I would highy recommend this resort, and highly recommend you spend some down time there. About the resort itself: The room...huge 2 bedroom, kitchen, balcony & washer and dryer were great. 1200 sq feet for the same price you would spend on the Disney Value resorts. The room was clean, although we had a few condensation marks on our drapes, probably from over running the air conditioner in the summer. Whenever we needed new towels, toilet paper, paper towels, dish detergent, etc -- call 0, and staff will bring it to you. Area...upscale area 10 minutes from Disney, 5 minutes from seaworld. Grocery store 2 blocks away. Property.....10 buildings around a lake, 2 huge pools, kids fountain areas and a clubhouse. a couple of small beaches (no swimming) but kids can make sandcastles. Gas grills for BBQing around lake every 300 feet or so. Eating -Grill/pool bar, full service restaurant & a grab and go on site, along with Dominos pizza & Benihana's. The resort is big enough not to be bored, but small enough that you can walk to everything. Very clean grounds. Was never bothered about a timeshare talk. Front desk was polite. A message was left on your phone every night about the following days activities. Negatives...Fitness center has 2 treadmills, 2 bikes & 1 eliptical. In my opinion, pathetic for the 1000 people the resort holds. Should be bigger. The bigger main pool's deck gets pretty slippery around the water slides. My younger daughter wiped out twice. On Saturdays it was hard to get lounge chairs around the pool (probably because you have the new people checking in along with the people checking out trying to get a last swim in before their flight). Check out is 10am, and they would not be flexible on that. If your flight is later, you can shower at the clubhouse. On Saturday nights they show poolside movies. Nice idea, but the movie was Avatar, and my kids (3 & 7) were scared to go in the pool while the movie was playing. I would suggest a younger movie.

We would have used the resort shuttle sevice but it only left at certain times(only 3 times a day)and went to certain parks. Disney was way to crowded but we made the best of it. The room at the resort was quite nice, with all of the amenities of home and plenty of space for the four of us. However, we heard every footstep from the room above and no one respected the quiet time of 11 pm. In fact it seemed that was the time when everybody decided to start partying. The clubhouse closed at 11 pm which problably explains the timing. There is an additional charge to have the maids come in and clean your room each day so we did not use their service, so the washer and drier in our room proved useful.

We never received any paperwork in the mail....so due to our busy life style we forgot about the vacation. THE RESORT HAPPILY GOT THEIR $200. In 1/10 we received a phone call from the resort saying that they would hono our vacation, even though it was past the experation date. My husband told the lady Christine in the sales department the I would be able to take the trip, but he would not be able to attend, She said that was not a problem and she switched everything over to my name. I spoke with Christine a number of times to set up my travel arrive and she upgraded my to stay at a villa for an extra $50 a night. So at this point, Fountains Resort has $450 of MY HARD EARNED MONEY. I called before I left before my long drive down the east coast from Cap Cod down to Florida (traveling alone).I told them that I did not received any confirmation in the mail that they were suyppose to send. They said \"NO WORRIES\" and someone would call me in the next 24-48 hrs...someone finally called me 5days later as I'm crossing the Florida state line. Long story short, they said they my husband would have to be present with me to take the 90minute time-share presentation for me to get that deal. I reminded her that I told Christine that my husband would not be joining me and the young lady Jennifer (who was very nice) said that they could not accomidate me without my husband. She intructed that I call her supervisor Jacklyn the next day to see if there was anything that she could do. I called Jacklyn the next day and she was absolutely useless. She is standing by the hotel policy that I was NEVER inform ed of,since paperwork was never sent out to me. So here I am in Florida with no place to stay and $450 that at this point I have a hell of a time getting back. Fountains Resort, ENJOY YOUR BAD REVIEW.

Not knowing where our trash chute was in the building we were staying in we called the \"service number\" and asked where ours was and their response was not to worry about it, just set it outside our door and someone would be right up to take it and gues what.....within 15 minutes it was GONE!!

We ordered food from the \"WatersEdge\" restaurant (which is located at the indoor/outdoor pool area) and it was excellent!

I understand that there were other people wanting to check in (the resort was definately NOT sold out!) but I felt that they could have allowed us to stay later because of the circumstances. Also, we took the timeshare meeting that was offered and even though they state that it will only be 90 minutes (and possibly up to 120 minutes!) we were not \"released\" until 10:20 and our \"meeting\" started at 7:30 so don't sign up for one of these unless you have 3 hrs. to waste!

My husband and I booked a week's stay at the Fountains so our grown children and their kids could visit us while we stayed in Orlando. We had each family stay two nights with us so everyone could enjoy the resort. We arrived on Friday at 3 PM and only had to wait a couple of minutes before it was our turn to check-in. Had no trouble at all with check-in. My husband requested a room in Building 10 (the newest building) which we were able to get. Our suite (two bedrooms, two baths) faced right out to the beautiful, large, pool area. We especially chose the Fountains because of the large pool slides, and the kiddie pool area. We had done a lot of researching online for a suite to stay at that was offered through our Armed Forces Vacation Club. When it came time to book, there really was no other resort that offered everything that the Fountains did. The suite had everything we would need for a week's stay, even a laundry basket, iron, and ironing board (although we did not use the iron or ironing board...lol). The bathrooms and kitchen all had granite countertops. The master bathroom was huge, the largest bathroom we've ever had the chance to experience. The shower was large enough for at least two people. There was a jetted bath tub but we did not use it as we both prefer showers. We also had a nice screened-in porch, which looked right out onto the pool area. What a lovely way to begin the day or end it! The resort offered lots of activities although we did not partipate in them since we were quite busy park hopping. One caution: the outdoor pool was never really warm enough for us to enjoy it. The \"heated\" pool was somewhat warmer but not what I would consider warm, although it was warm enough so that we could swim in it. The resort had several (I think 4) hot tubs, which we did use several times, usually after a long day at one of the theme parks. The hot tub to the left of the large pool is salt water, if you prefer that. I heard it's supposed to be good for your skin. The hot tub inside near the indoor-outdoor pool has a sign stating that children are not allowed in it, but while we were there, most of the time the only people in that hot tub were kids. Although we had read online that some people were harassed by phone calls wanting them to purchase a time share, we never received even one of those calls.

The resort is very well kept and clean. Once we walked into the lobby to register, it was like fresh air, very clean. Even the restrooms in the lobby area so clean and it always smells fresh. We ere staying in building 4 on the second floor and had a 2 bedroom deluxe. Inside of the rooms is okay, nothing over the top. We had a screened patio which was great. We mainly used the pool that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by building 4 since it was close to our building and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel walking to the wakoola springs pool which is humongous. The pool by building 4 was always well kept throughout the day, but then again there were not many people at the pool, the most was maybe 4-5 people a day. The one problem that we ran into was with the outside Jacuzzi. The outside Jacuzzi was way too hot when I say hot I mean hot, you could not go in right away and had to go in gradually, even after you got in well you had to get out because you could not be in there for very long since it was ridiculously hot. We reported it to the staff and nothing was done about it, and we were at the resort for 7 days. Then the Jacuzzi in the inside pool was cold for a day and the next day hot just like the Jacuzzi outside. We have been on fountains property for a week and the Jacuzzi problem was not fixed. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that the guests should address that issue and report it to the staff, after all they have people who are opening the pools in the morning shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they check the water temperatures? Well I guess at Fountains they just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care, they wait until a guest gets burned or something before they take it seriously. Second complain I have is the free shuttle to Disney. Beware that the free shuttle is not really free and here is why: We reserved the shuttle, got in the shuttle, and as soon as the driver started to drive, he pulled a sign that states that tip is expected and next to the sign was a $5 bill. That really made me so mad, I mean don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong of course I would tip and its up to each individual to tip but you can not put a sign up like that pretty much forcing the passengers to tip and to top it of putting a dollar amount on that tip or making us look stupid as if we do not know to tip the driver. I have read a lot of complaints about not being able to take any food to the pool, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that, because I have seen 2 other families including us eat and drink at the pool and we were not told anything. Keep in mind also that throughout our stay there maybe 4-5 people the most at the pool, I guess its because of the slow season. And the pools stay open until 10 p.m. even through I hear that the inside pool is supposed to be open until 11 p.m. The security at the resort is absolutely great, you could walk at any time and feel absolutely safe. There is also a Walgreens and a Publix (love that store and wish we had one here where we live) so you can get your grocery done there. I also recommend getting the Trolley pass, it is worth it every penny especially when you go get groceries. Another tip I have is if you want to save on transportation from and to the resort, then you can hop on a bus from the airport and it will take you directly to the resort, I think its bus 42, not sure. When you walk out of the airport just follow the signs for buses or ask which bus takes you to to international drive, you pay 2 bucks a person and save at least 50 bucks that way, taxis and shuttles are very expensive. And if you are going to the airport there is a bust stop right in front of the hotel so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to walk a lot. The bus drive is at least 2 hours but in my mind worth it.

A couple of gripes - no umbrellas for shade just a few palm trees and the cost of drinks in the bar was extortionate! That aside the whole area was clean and well landscaped. We found the resort well placed for all the attractions in Orlando but you do need to have a car. Another bonus was free parking. The not so good things which irritated a little were that cleaning of the apartment during your stay incurs a charge of $10 per day (something which is not mentioned on their website); there was no blanket provided for the sofa bed and the sofa bed was difficult to operate and not particularly comfortable. There is also a ban on guests taking their own food and drink to the pool areas - if the bar prices were more reasonable people would not want to take their own!!

We stayed for a week and had minimal problems. They gave us a complimentary midweek room refreshment which we have never received at other week long stays. The last night we stayed there was a lot of noise coming from a room above us. It was around midnight so I called security. They were at our room asking where the noise was coming from within 10 minutes and they put a stop to it within 15-20 minutes. That is service if you ask me. Also, our safe in our room locked us out and we called the front desk. They had it fixed within 20 minutes. I couldn't have asked for better results. This resort is definitely worth it.

This was our 4th time in Orlando and this is the best place we have stayed in (it just beats the Bahama Bay we stayed in last time due to its location) We stayed in building 6 on the 5th floor overlooking the Wakoola pool area and centre lake. Our 2 bedroomed villa was huge with everything you could ever need (yes including a Jacuzzi!). The beds were extremely comfortable and the furnishings were of a high standard, it was a great place to relax in after days out at theme parks or shopping, The room was quiet and we never suffered with noise from other guests. The aircon worked very well and wasn't noisy like others have said. During our stay we received a room clean after the first week that was unexpected. Security on site is excellent - vehicles have to pass a manned gatehouse to get in and out. The grounds are spotlessly clean. The pools were great and never seemed busy - the Wakoola area is the newest one and is massive with 2 slides and a kids water play area and there is plenty of room to swim. It is true that you are required to wear a wristband - this is so that non residents don't come in - but you are only required to wear it while in the pool area and you can get a new one each time you visit. Pool towels are also provided. They don't allow you to take your own food and drinks to the pool area, which I think is fair enough - they are a business after all - and the food and drink (and service) at the grill is good, if you're that bothered you can always pop back to your apartment! There is a daily activities programme within the resort each day, although we never used it. We were never pressurised into taking a timeshare tour like others have said, although the standards within the resort made it pretty tempting to take a look! The location of The Fountains Resort is excellent - nothing is too far away, Disney is about 20 mins, Universal about 20 mins, Seaworld 10 mins. There is a Publix and Walgreens 5 mins away and a Benihana 2 minuites walkaway (which is fantastic).

On a following day, we had a small lunch cooler with us for drinks and snacks and were told we were not allowed any outside food or beverages due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153health code violations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I asked which codes they were referring to, as I have never been asked to leave a pool before because of chips and sodas. Of course the waiter was super rude and argued with me about this. So, we had to pack everything up and go back upstairs. This pool situation was completely unacceptable. When on vacation, you want to enjoy the pool area and not be hassled when trying to relax and enjoy yourself. I can understand a no glass policy but no coolers at all??? The location of the resort is relatively close to Sea World- about 10 min drive. It was also close to other shopping and restaurants which was convenient. So, I would not recommend the Fountains if you are looking to spend time at the pool and have fun. Also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any accommodations for early check in or late check out.", "Date": "July 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot A Family Hotel\u201d", "Author": "TravelGuru9999", "ReviewID": "UR35239973", "Content": "Stayed there in July 2009.

We were told that we had to put them on, and go to the front desk to have them cut off if we were going out and wanted them off to obtain a replacement. Nedless to say, we only wore them when we were out of the unit, on the property, loose enough to slip them off. We found our unit, and eventually parking (which is supposed to be limited to a space a unit). Expecting it to be a lot nicer then what we came to, according to past reviews. The decor was modern, and it was adequate, but the master bed was horrid, hard and sagging. The other beds were better, but still quite hard, and that room had a window that led onto the outdoor hallway. There is just enough cabinet space for kitchen equipment, but none for sundries that you might bring.

It is too bad there wasn't a happy medium.

The Resort is very well maintained, clean, very friendly and accomodating staff, 2 beautiful pool areas with slides and sprinklers and activities for the children. We stayed in Building 6 which was perfect. I liked the outdoor pool that was half covered so that when we got too much sun, we just moved our things indoors. The pool towels were big and we always got one. It wasn't a big deal to hand your pool card in for a towel each day, in fact, some days we forgot our card and got towels anyway. We had a 2 bed/2 bath which had a ton of room, very comfortable and clean and attractive looking. Really liked the screened in deck so no bug issues there. The food and drinks on the resort was very good. Very close to theme parks which we went to for 4 of the 7 days we were there. The other 3 days we relaxed by the pools. There was music by both pools playing most of the time, so while we were in Building 6 and didn't hear any of the music, I'm not sure if it would be a nuisance if your room was close to the pools. But, while at the pools, the music was nice, mostly pop music. The only negative remarks I have is the bathroom by the indoor/outdoor pool area could be kept cleaner. Quite often it smelled of urine and the floor seemed dirty. I did tell one of the staff members and he quickly went to clean/mop the floors, but the next day again it smelled. There was another bathroom closeby inside, so I just used that one. The other disappointing factor was at the coffee/breakfast bar - their iced coffee machine which makes various iced coffee/cappuccino drinks was broken the entire time we were there. Was told it broke the week prior and the person working there, while very nice, said he wasn't sure if it was going to be fixed or if they were waiting on a new one. So, the only iced option was to pour ice over hot coffee. So, that was too bad considering we had 90 degree weather all week and a refreshing iced coffee would have been nice. They do have 2 computers for internet use - and the web was so very slow - a bit annoying to try and use -but we only used it for personal reasons, so it wasn't a big deal.

Our family had 4 rooms at this resort. 2 families were in bldg. 7 and 2 in bldg. 8 which are new bldgs and right next to each other. First I would like to say checking in was easy but getting there with the way their road system is can be confusing - they need to better mark their roads. The Fountains has added a few new building in the last 2-3 years and in doing that the whole layout is different then it was before. check in is now before the guard gate in a building on the left - I didn't really look to see what else was there but it looked nice. I checked in about 5:00pm and there were 2 people working and one was assisting a customer the other assisted me. All was good and I asked him about the internet right off because my son is 18 and he likes to be connected as I do (we both brought our laptops) I was informed that internet was 9.00+ for a day and the longer you have it the cheaper the daily rate gets - I wanted 3 days which would have been about $21.00. we checked into our room and it was very nice - 2BR 2Bath - plenty of room for us - I think all the rooms are basically the same everything was clean the grounds were nice - I had a fountain view the pool was a short walk away and was nice and not crowded. It was the pool with the double slide which my nephews loved. they also had a smaller water area for toddlers. They sell food at the pool area but I didn't buy any so I can't tell you anything about that. We stopped at the market (lots of stores near the Fountains!) and got provisions before checking in. I have no complaints about anything in this resort EXCEPT the internet - it did not work the entire time I was there - which is only part of the issue - front desk people outright lied about it and that really bothers me. Having others in the hotel that were there at the beginning of the week who could not get on at that time either didn't help with the lying. I was told it must be an issue in my room (it was not) I spoke on the phone with Logicnet (something like that) and they told me that they could not connect with the hotel and it was a hotel issue and that they were having other complaints about it and thought it was being taken care of. I called the front desk and they said that wasn't true that it was the providers issue. well I don't care can someone address it and have it taken care of??? next day I call again - provider says it hasn't heard from resort - resort says it will be fixed in the next hour or so - 8 hours later still not fixed - now I am trying to speak with someone from management regarding the whole thing - front desk said it is just my building which again was not true because bldg 8 could not connect either. Management never called me regarding the issue and I basically gave up. I own 2 timeshares I have never had issues where they wouldn't call back. These are NEW buildings they should have wireless access which they do not - and I don't know how long it has been down but a week is a 6 days to long. Some may wonder why this is a big deal - this trip was not just a vacation and I needed to be connected and was informed by the resort that I would be connected and listed myself as reachable through e-mail and I was not. Also if your in Orlando there are bargains galore if you look them up you can also find places to eat and discounts online. It was very disappointing to myself and my son we both brought laptops from NY on the plane and carried them to this resort for nothing.

We stayed in building 6 for what it's worth. Why did we choose the Fountains? A marketing package, originally targeted for my father in law, was transferred to us as a gift. Although, we did have to meet some qualifications and cover some initial costs of approximately $500, but the package came with a free rental car (except for the taxes) and tickets to Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure - contingent upon attending a timeshare presentation that was described as only requiring 90 minutes of our time. It actually lasted about 4 hours. What were our motives for a vacation? We have been married for 4+ years and do not yet have children. However, I am 36 and my wife nearly 30, so we are beyond wanting to go clubbing and bar hopping, but without having our own children yet, we are not ready to hole up in a theme park for a week either. We prefer a balance of \"some\" nightlife activities and/or fine dining and \"some\" family oriented things as well, with a sprinkle of sandy beaches and cool ocean waves thrown in there too. It was our first vacation together since our honeymoon in the Mayan Peninsula where we had an unforgettable all-inclusive (all alcohol and food included) vacation. What were our expectations for Florida? Having not been there since I was a child, I didn't know what to expect. It was spring break for most of the country, so I was afraid to run into 21-yr olds at every corner getting plastered, so we avoided places like Daytona Beach and Fort Lauderdale, instead visiting Cocoa Beach and Satellite Beach (slightly south of Cocoa Beach), which was a nice blend of young and older people and not too crowded, although no boardwalk or beach front restaurants/bars - come prepared with your own. What were your expectations for the Fountains? Described as a world class resort, I expected to be treated like kings and queens, especially considering they were trying to sell us on buying a timeshare with Bluegreen, the company that owns the Fountains as I understand it. What were your first impressions with the Fountains? We had a late flight and didn't arrive to the front desk until 1:30 AM at which point we were informed that our mandatory timeshare presentation was at 10:30 AM the same morning, which if you missed it, you would void the promotional deal and be responsible for the full cost of your stay. Throw in the fact that it was also the night we were going to push the clocks ahead an hour. So we weren't thrilled with having to be at a presentation 8 hours after pulling up to the front desk. We had just enough time to unpack and sleep for 6 hours after spending all day traveling, not a great way to begin a \"vacation.\" Neither the man at the front desk nor the security guard seemed overly friendly either, which I can now say was a foreshadow of the rest of our stay. What were your impressions of the sales pitch by Bluegreen? It was the 2nd timeshare presentation we've attended in our lifetimes, so we knew to expect the worst. It started off with an entertaining host, but digressed from that point on during the near 4-hour ordeal which had been advertised as a 90 minute presentation. To sum it up, it was way out of our budget, and I am not the type of person who does impulse shopping. They wanted an answer that day before we walked out of the presentation or the offer was no longer valid. Eventually when our saleswoman couldn't get us to sign on the dotted line, she brought over her boss who completely turned us off from the idea of purchasing a timeshare with them. So after 3 hours and 50 minutes, we were finally free to go and they accepted our answer as a \"no.\" What were your impressions with your room? I was very impressed at first. I mean I never stayed in a condo on vacation. It had everything you thought you might need - full kitchen w/dishwasher, washer & dryer, dining room, living room, screened in patio, 3 televisions with a DVD player and mini stereo in living room, pull out sofa, love seat, master bedroom with jet tub and private bath, second bedroom with two queen beds and separate bath. It was easily the biggest dwelling I've rented on vacation. It seemed clean to me unlike other reports I've read on here. Our balcony overlooked a man made pond or lake that had two lit up fountains for eye candy. How was the Internet access? For starters, I quickly learned that bringing my windows vista laptop was a moot point unless I wanted to spend a large majority of my free time hanging out at the clubhouse to pick up their wireless signal. My first evening there I called the front desk to inquire about how to connect to their wireless service (as my laptop detected three different wireless signals coming from the fountains or bluegreen from my patio). I was then informed that I could only use the wired modem in the living room area (which was only seven feet long - not a lot of flexibility to move around) if I wanted the Internet in our condo. Then she explained that the fees were either 1) $9.95 per day, 2) $20.85 for 3 days or 3) $29.70 for 6 days. I was willing to pay for a week's worth, but after spending an hour on the phone with tech support, I was unable to connect to the Internet using their modem. After contacting the front desk to report this, they wanted to transfer me back to tech support, which I declined. Eventually, I got them to agree to send me a new modem and ethernet cable to see if that was the problem. The guy who came to our door brought a new modem but not a new cable. Unfortunately the new modem didn't fix the problem, and then after telling him I have Windows Vista, he quipped that the Lodgenet modems don't usually work with Vista. What?? How can they not work with the most commonly sold Windows platform that has been on PC's for over two years?? This was a huge turning point in my opinion, because not only do I work in the IT business, I am taking classes in IT, and I use the Internet for so much of my life right now. I did not expect to have to go a week without convenient access to the Internet. I know a vacation is about relaxing, but you'd be surprised at how much I can cover over a bowl of cereal and a coffee while on the Internet, or while having a late evening beer on the patio. Not here though. Only twice did I access their free wireless service because it was so inconvenient to pack it up and walk down to the clubhouse just get online for 30 minutes. Strike 1. How was the fitness room? OK maybe nobody else goes on vacation expecting to maintain their workout schedule. But for me, I've been making good progress for the past 8 weeks working out 3 times a week and didn't want to lose that ritual I've created, so I was happy to see the Fountains offered a fitness room. I've seen other fitness rooms at the Days Inn, which weren't all that bad, so I figured at a \"world class resort\" such as the Fountains, it would be more than adequate. Surprise! The one they had at the Fountains made the ones at Days Inn seem like they were made for professional athletes. This \"fitness room\" had two treadmills and one universal machine where you could do a lat pull down, a leg press, and I'm not sure but maybe a bench press using cabled weights. There were no free weights at all for anything else, and certainly no elliptical machines if that's what you prefer. It was the size of a big walk in closet and barely ventilated if at all. It was a complete joke and disappointment. Strike 2. How were the pools? You'd think with having pools here, that it would be a great thing where a wife and husband could retreat to after a long day on the go. Unfortunately they were quite shallow for the most part, where most of it was 3 feet deep getting to at most less than 6 feet in the middle. There were 2 slides, but after my wife and I went down them once, we realized how slow and unexciting they were and opted to avoid them, but for five year olds they would be fine. The water though was very warm, I'll give them that. The larger of the two pools closed at 9pm, the other at 10pm. Many times we returned back to the resort between 9-10 pm thinking how nice it would be to unwind with a late dip, only to be reminded that they had already closed or were about to be closed. All in all, these pools seemed to serve the needs of those with small children rather than say those of a romantic couple looking to unwind. Strike 3. How was the service at this world class resort? If you're used to getting daily maid service for free like you do at a cheap motel, don't expect it here. It costs about $25/day if you decide you need or want it. Needless to say, we chose not to purchase any maid services. It was kind of a bummer, because isn't half the fun of vacationing away from home the fact that somebody comes in and makes your bed for you? Seriously though, between there being no complimentary continental breakfasts and having to clean up after yourself everyday, and the fact that the linens on the king size bed weren't fitted, it felt like anything but world class service. Oh and twice we asked the front desk for a wake up call, and both times they were 15 minutes late in giving us the wake up call. When we went to the pool, we took this credit card thing they gave us, which you have to turn in to get a pool towel, and then when you return the towel you get your card back. If you lose this card, you have to pay $10 when you checkout. So when we went to the towel hut inside the pool area, we stood there for at least 5 minutes without anyone around to help, before just taking our own towels. When we went to the clubhouse and checked out the other pool and pool side bar, there was a woman who had been waiting at the bar for help prior to us getting there, and even by the time we walked around and looked at everything, the same woman was still standing there looking around waiting for someone to come by and assist her. And she was the only customer, so it's not like they were busy. World class service....ya OK. How were the two hot tubs, two bridges and two fire circles for campfires in the Wakoola Springs? Didn't test out the hot tubs, only being two with several buildings of vacationers, it didn't seem like enough. Only recall one bridge we crossed to get to the one pool,and below it was a dried up pond/lake so when you looked down you saw nothing but mud and dirt - quite the eye sore. Didn't see anyone using the fire circles, as it's sunny Florida and the last thing on my mind was wanting to sit around a camp fire next to my condo. Maybe if there was on ocean front view with a cool breeze then yes, but that was 50 miles away. All in all, considering we got the place at a discounted rate, it was just OK. Had we paid full price this never would have been acceptable. Upon driving to Cocoa beach a few times, my wife and I would see cheap beach side motels that advertised free wireless internet, and then we'd laugh and I'd say why didn't we just stay at one of these ratty little motels instead, at which my wife would respond \"because you don't love me enough.\" The sad thing is, we probably would have enjoyed our stay more at one of those one room places with the beach outside our back door and working internet service in our room than we did at the Fountains. So glad we didn't opt to purchase a timeshare from Bluegreen, at least based on our experience at the Fountains.", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington,Ontario", "Title": "\u201cI'd go back\u201d", "Author": "richa321", "ReviewID": "UR25781447", "Content": "Just came back from 7 days at the fountains.

I can't wait to return to Orlando in August I will probably stay at my favorite place Sheraton Vistana Resort which I have already booked if The Foutains had there rates up I would have booked for them I love to travel for 2 weeks well I can't wait to get back I have pictures I have to upload and then I'll put them on here.", "Date": "December 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Allen Park, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cLove it\u201d", "Author": "derines", "ReviewID": "UR21988137", "Content": "I went to the Fountains for the first time last week.

It is just a few minutes from Walt Disney and Universal and a very short and easy commute from the Airport. There is also a Walgreens and Publix right around the corner making it easy to pick up provisions for your holiday. The pool area is fantastic. We stayed in Building Two which is located between the check-in/breakfest building and the main pool area. The Pool area is Immaculate and has a very large water slide that is fun for both children and adults. There is also a neat kiddie area in the pool that has some neat fountains and things for the little ones to play on. Best of All there is a full service pool side bar with what seemed very reasonable prices given that it is a resort area. The rooms are clean and their is a big whirlpool/jacuzzi bathtub in the master suite that really is relaxing after a long day of hauling little ones around the theme parks. Each unit has two rooms which makes it nice when traveling with family and children. The Bad: Our unit was somewhat dark and the lighting is terrible. The rooms are very clean but not necessarily inviting. The best example that I can give is that you feel like you are in a clean nice holiday inn. A great place to sleep and eat but your not going to want to hang out in there. In other words nothing bad but nothing special No free internet. This really ticked me off because they charge $10 a day to log on and wifi is not available in the unit so you have to use the network cable which limits where you can sit. There is a Panera bread close by so you can go there for free service if need be. The 10 dollars a day is ridiculous and they should offer this service for free. They also have a few computers in the main building that you can use if you need to. The walls are very thin and we could hear everyone flushing their toilets in the morning. We were on the first floor which may have been part of the problem. Conclusion: We stayed at the Fountains because our family member is a part of Bluegreen and only charged us $450 for the week. For the cost, and location, I was happy overall. We had debated whether to stay on a Disney property and ultimately went with the fountains since the price was right. In hindsight I feel that we made the right decision. The disney resorts are neat but unless you are at one on the monorail system you will need a rental car anyways. Considering that we spent very little time in the room anyways I think the savings was worth it and we were able to spend money on nicer meals and gifts for our children. Bottom Line is that the Fountains is a clean nice resort with adequate amenties at a reasonable cost.

It was a nice place, but a little rough around some of the edges. First the positives: The location is perfect. Located on International Drive South and only 10 minutes from the theme parks. Plenty of dining options and a Publix and Walgreens nearby. Both of the pool areas were beautifully landscaped and maintained. Though we only spent one night at the pool, it was very nice and relaxing. It is a gated resort with 24 hour security. You must display your parking pass on your windshield to gain access. The room was clean and comfortable (the pillows were a bit flat however) with a full kitchen and a fully screened patio. The room came with a safe, free of charge large enough for all our valuables and would easily accomodate a lap top computer. This is a time share resort, so when you go to pick up your parking pass they invite you to attend a 90 minute sales pitch for $150. We simply stated we were not interested, and were never bothered again. Now some of the negatives. We were placed in one of the older buildings, #6. Though the room was clean, the exterior coridors needed a good power washing. The concrete ground was filthy and garbage seemed to accumulate at the trash bins. We saw the same over flowing garbage can bins near the elevators for 2 days. I know it was the same garbage because there were empty beer cases along the side filled with trash. The first room we checked into had some problems. The burners on the electric stove were detached from the stove. This is a real fire hazard. The room also had a damp and musty smell. We asked for a different room and were given one with no questions asked. I read on some previous reviews that the walls were thin. I didn't believe this but it's true. We had no real problems, but our last night I could hear our neighbors loud conversation and laughing throughout the night. It was so loud that I heard their plans for the next day. We requested some extra pillows and pillow cases when we checked in. They said they would send them right up. After an hour, no pillows. I called again, they said they would send them right up. I gave them permission to enter the room to drop them off as we were anixous to get to Downtown Disney. When we returned later that evening, still no pillows. It took 3 phone calls to fill this request. One last small detail, there is not many handicap parking places at each building. I have an issue with my left side, but I am not confined to a wheel chair so it is not an issue for me to walk a little farther. However, if someone needs to unload a wheelchair from a van, this could be a major issue. All in all, this is a nice resort. However I doubt we will ever stay here again. For just a bit more money we could have stayed at Vistana which I feel is far superior to The Fountains.

An arcade and playground are there also. (the resort has 3 fenced in playgrounds around the property that were clean and safe and fun for the kids). The other pool area is the \"big pool\" - this is where I could spend every day. The pool was very clean, BIG and it had 2 water slides that adults can go on, too. Attached is the kids area with fountains, splash buckets and lots of squirting water. Another kids area the water squirts up from the gound and was fun to watch all of the fun they were having. There is a pool bar and grill with decent food and very good pina coladas. There is towel service so no need to bring beach towels. They play fun music to make the atmosphere very nice. There are cabanas you can rent and even get a massage poolside if you want. There are 2 very big hot tubs at the pool area that I commented how clean they were. Our family really had a good time.

My parents gave us a week free at any timeshare as our wedding present and we decided to stay here as it was close to the theme parks and only 25 minutes to Orlando International Airport. IT WAS A GREAT CHOICE! We had been traveling since 4:00am by the time we got to the resort after 1:00pm and we were exhausted. Check-in is normally 4:00pm, but we were hoping that our room would be available early. Sure enough, it was! SCORE! Check in was simple. We had a gift certificate so we did not have to pay for the room. The lobby (or \"Clubhouse\" as they call it) could not have been more adorable. They don't call it \"The Fountains\" for nothing! There were several fountains all around the clubhouse and the resort so it was really something beautiful to look at. After check-in, we had to pick up our parking pass (complementary) at the concierge desk. She informed us of the weather for the week, asked us if we needed to buy park tickets, than tried to get us to come to a timeshare presentation for $150. We said no, and we were never asked about it again for the rest of our trip. Our room was located in building three (to the immediate right of the clubhouse) on the 6th floor. It was IMMACULATE! We had a 2 bedroom, which we did not need, but for the sake of argument, it was large enough for a family of 6. It was spacious and had a lot of unique amenities I had never seen in a timeshare like a washer and dryer and jacuzzi tub! Excellent! I should also mention that laundry detergent, dish soap, shampoo, conditioner, soap etc were all included in the room. We also had a wonderful view of Lake Eve from our double balcony that has beautiful sunrises in the morning. The Publix grocery store was about a 2 minute drive from the resort as well as the Walgreens and Denny's. The resort is approx. 5 minutes from Sea World, 15 minutes from Walt Disney World and 20 minutes to Universal Studios so it was very convenient for driving to the parks. The Florida Mall was about 20 minutes away and there were outlet malls right across the street from the Publix. Overall, it was in a great location on International Drive close to everything, but not busy. More resort area than downtown. There were 2 pools at the resort. One large wraparound pool with a waterslide for the children. It was really nice because on the weekends, they hire a DJ to spin music so the atmosphere is really fun for everyone! The other pool is a lot quieter right near the lake. It is right beside the 10 person hottub and a spash pool with fountain for children. I should also mention that the lake, Lake Eve, is not a place to swim, but it does have a dock with several pattleboats for rental if you should find time to use them. We never had the time since we were always at the parks, but the pools were great for taking a dip after a long day at the parks. Check-out was simple and there were no surprises at the end. Just a word of caution. The resort charges you $0.50 (fifty cents) for a LOCAL call, so if you have a cell phone, I suggest using it instead. But as a bonus, your room has free internet access. It has a modem built-in to the phone so you can bring a computer, even if it isn't wireless. Overall, The Fountains was a great place for us on our honeymoon. It was (and still is) hurricane season so we really took a chance on going to Florida in September, but we had a fantastic time and pleasantly enjoyed our stay at the resort. I would definitely recommend this resort for not only families, but honeymooners or spring breakers.

We were very pleased to get last minute reservations at this resort, and we found it to be much nicer than the resort we stayed at the first week. The unit was very clean and well maintained. The jacuzzi tub in the mbr was clean and easily large enough for two. The walk in shower was perfect. The full size washer/dryer and well equipped kitchen definitely met our needs. We all thought the beds were very comfortable; the kids especially loved having full sized beds in their bedroom rather than the typical twin sized beds. Even the sofa bed was decent. The kids loved the pool area with the slides, and there were plenty of pool games and activities to keep them occupied. The pools were closed one day due to the storm, but the resort provided free dvds, puzzles and games to keep everyone occupied. The indoor/outdoor pool was very nice and clean. There is also a sauna, steam room and fitness room. There is a piano bar that offers drink specials and surprisingly good food. Our only complaint was that the pools do not stay open long enough, generally closing at 10 p.m. They are very focused on customer satisfaction and try very hard to exceed expectations. When I asked for a larger pot to cook in, housekeeping had it to us in minutes. I also called for extra blankets and towels when the storm was passing through and housekeeping had them to us in just a few minutes, They didn't just bring a couple of towels though, they brought a huge bag of folded towels, bath cloths and hand towels to be sure we had what we needed. I was very impressed. They never acted as if it was an inconvenience to bring anything to us. We started out booking for only 2 nights to see how the storm would affect our trip, but we ended up staying 5 nights because we liked the resort so well. This caused confusion on the part of the resort staff as we lenthened our stay 3 separate times. Each time they would call us just afterward as if we were new guests and offered us the timeshare pitch. Each time we had to tell them that we had extended our stay and were not new guests. I was concerned that after a week of Disney World the kids would be bored doing nothing, but they raved about this resort and all the activities that were offered.

This resort is incredible. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. From the security to the activities staff we were impressed. Upon our check in we were amazed at the size of our room. Wow! The rooms were complete with everything you would need and more. The resort grounds Clean, impeccable and a nice display of landscaping. This resort does an incredible job of keeping the grounds in tip top shape. The lakes are of impressive size and if you have time take advantage of the paddle boats (they are shaped like swans). They also have a tennis court and several grills on site for you to grill. The pools Again, wow! Two large sized pools. Wakoola Springs is immense. It boasts a zero entry kiddie area for younger kids and a water slide for older kids. There are at the least 5 sections, which are large enough. Since the pool is so large you do not feel crowded and can easily swim without bumping into people. Wakoola Springs also has a rather large hot tub on site that can accommodate quite a few people. The indoor/outdoor pool is also very large. It boasts a separate kiddie pool with a fountain. My daughter absolutely loved it. The indoor/outdoor pool has a volleyball net inside if you have an interest in playing water volleyball. Also, there is a steam room, bot tub, and pool table at this location. The rooms We stayed in a two bedroom villa that was equipped with a full kitchen (they had everything you would need to cook and eat off of and more). At check in you are also provided with dish detergent, paper towels, clean dish linens, and laundry detergent. Our room had two separate bathrooms, with one of the rooms having a jacuzzi in the bedroom. We had a private balcony overlooking one of the lakes and near Wakoola Springs. Overall Impression This resort has impeccable grounds and full array of activities for adults (happy hour, music by the pool,etc) and children alike (dancing contests, raft races, movies and pizza, karaoke, etc). If you have the time you really need to take advantage of their facilities and activities. Everyday they had scheduled activities at the pool and despite what others say, the pool did not close for the day and there were several days of severe storms.

The resort looked new, a water park was being built and there were lakes on the property. The rooms were decorated nicely and were very clean. The front desk was extremely busy, but the staff was courteous and we were quickly checked-in. We were really impressed with everything we had seen so far. Like others, we're Bluegreen owners, but unlike others, we didn't receive a sales call and we weren't badgered to attend any meetings. That was great, really great. Now for the not-so-good stuff. We were usually at an area attraction from lunch to late at night each day. Every evening after returning and putting the kids to bed, my wife and I would stay up for a while before going to bed. We'd hear the usual sounds from rooms next door, but we noticed we could understand what was being said. We made note of that and didn't think much about it until my wife went to bed. I'm a night person so I'm usually up alone until 1:00 each morning reading, watching tv, or scanning the internet (I didn't here because of the cost). On the first night as I was reading, I could hear someone in the room above us use the bathroom - not just the flushing sound, but the sound of urine hitting water followed by the flush. Just about the time the person was finished, I heard the same thing from the room next door. This was soon followed by the same sounds from a third room above me, but to one side. The next morning, I went to the front desk and reported this. The clerk said that they have never had that complaint before. She checked room availability, but she was not able to move us since there weren't any rooms similar in size for my family. I said that was okay and that I was just passing infomration to her. Well, the next night, I stayed up and watched tv and the same thing happened, not from all the rooms, but only from the one next door. As I indicated earlier, this wasn't bad or an annoyance, but was kind of humorous. When we checked out, I talked with another clerk about it and he stated that others have complained about thin walls. I told him that I wasn't complaining, but just giving information. Overall, our stay was good and we'll stay again because of the location to Disney and Seaworld, and the swimming pools, but I think I'll turn-in earlier in the evening to avoid the above scenario. I'd also recommend the Sunshine Resort, we stayed there for three nights before moving to The Fountains for three more nights.", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Myrtle Beach, SC", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Fountains!!!

The location was very good it took about 10 minutes to get to Magic Kingdom parking lot. There are about 30 restaurants or more right down the road from the resort. Another review I have seen a lot was about the bed sheets not fitting correctly. I didn't have any problem with any of the beds. The room was very clean when I arrived and any time that I asked for something they were knocking on my door within 5 minutes. Yeah I did go to the timeshare meeting or whatever they call it and all I did was say I know my family wouldn't use it. The manager came over asked me did enjoy the Fountains so far and told the lady to sign us out so we can continue our vacation!!

Very short drive to Sea world and Disney. We only had one good day to spend at the pool which has a great spot for kids to play and our kids loved the water slide. The only other times we were able to go to the pool was at night after going to the parks. The main pool stayed open until 9 and the pool at the check in spot stayed open until 10. The resort leaves you messages on your phone daily to let you know of the activities they have that you can sign up for. There seemed to be plenty of activities you could sign up for but we were there to visit the parks so we had no time for any of those things.

Amazingly, our feet remained clean the rest of the week:). I also had the joy of cleaning all the dishes in the room...it was beginning to feel like home! I was also annoyed at the advertisements for hotel wi-fi which would have ended up being quite costly if I hadn't inquired prior to logging on since I was just seeing signs everywhere but no mention of cost. Also, beaware of the frequent attempts to sell you a timeshare. Upon arriving, in order to get your required parking pass, you have to listen to a sales talk about signing up for another sales talk.

My brother in law stayed here last year and recommended it as a base from which to do the theme parks. He was so right. This is perfect for a family. We where a party of 5 with the children ranging from 17 to 3. This place ticked all the boxes in terms of entertainment and accomodation. Everyone had there own space and no one was board. ROOMS Excellent size for a family, not cramped or on top of each other at all. Master bedroom has queen size bed (no the sheets don't fit but there is a trick to it) with a jacuzzi in the main room (excellent after a day round the parks with a beer) and seperate shower room. 2nd bedroom had two double beds and ensuite bathroom (bath with shower over). The living area has plenty of space, with a good balcony, and brilliantly a laundry room (cupboard) with washer & dryer (no none of us want to do washing on holday but I have to admit it was useful). They are not luxurious but better than most european standards and very clean. There is no daily maid service but a complete clean (we had one half way through our 2 week stay) is \u00c2\u00a312.50- and actually they forgot to add it to the bill at the end of the stay. Clothes storage was just OK for 5 people (bearing in mind 4 of us are female!) TV in every room, good range of chanels (DVD player does not play european DVDs). Stereo in main living area. Games console chargeable. FACILITIES Both pools are good, the larger one (with slides) good in the daytime & the smaller (indoor/outdoor) in the evening (cos the water is so warm). Only ate at the pool bar once (Wakola Grill) and it was fine. Prices for drinks & food reasonable. A few little play areas for the younger kids. Constant entertainment for the children which we hardly used (because we where out and about, but when did use was good). Good clean gas BBQs next to each block - we used it once & was really good. Sandy sitting areas around the lake. Small on site shop where you can get a British paper. LOCATION Although on I-Drive, as with most places in the states, you had to drive everywhere! Good location for Disney (10-15 minutes) & Seaworld (2 mins) & Universal (10-15 mins). 20 minutes from airport. Publix supermarket round the corner (on Vineland) was good. We ate on I-Drive most nights - good selection of resteraunts 5 mins away (in the car!). SERVICE/STAFF Was very good, check in straight forward (as was check out), staff friendly but not over the top. No one tried to sell us anything! CRITISCISMS Check out is 10am we did manage to get it extended to 11am. Music starts pumping round the resort (not mega loud) at 9am, just when my 3 year old discovered lie ins!

We found it ideal to split up (although there were just 5 of us- 2 couples and 1 child). The units are big enough for a couple and up to 4 kids though. However, if you have more than one couple, 2 units would be best so you both can have the King bedroom and not have to sleep in doubles. The resort is great- the location is fantastic right off International Drive by Seaworld- much more desirable than the Kissimmee/Clermont area which shows its age and is somewhat rundown looking. The outlets (quite upscale, Tods, Burberry, Armani, Tag, etc.) are about a mile away. The Fountains isn't too big and everything is within easy walking distance (all buildings but maybe 2 surround the new fantastic pool area and are only a few minutes walk from it). The clubhouse is nice and the pool there (indoor and outdoor) great, but nothing compared to the enormity of the new pool area that opened in March 08.

The check in took a bit but we arrived with everyone else around 4pm. We have two year old twins so we were looking for an easy room to get to and one that was close to the action per se. The reception lady got us a great villa in building 2 which backs up to the new pool. It is hard for me to imagine what this place was like with the one pool. This pool made all of the difference. It has plenty of room and a kids section at the far end. There are plenty of bathrooms and the activity staff is always putting something together. They have a water slide for the bigger kids and adults and most people seemed to like it. The Grill is new and it looked like they may have been struggling a bit. We never ate there but we did go there for a drink and at $8 for a margarita, I was not returning. They would do great if they advertised specials and if they had pizza on the menu. I saw Dominos driving in on many occasions with pizza and thought that they would have done better if they could have kept business inside the resort. We went on the paddleboats and that was cute and we participated at the bonfire. That was neat because you could see the fireworks at the Magic Kingdom as you roasted a marshmallow on the fire. The villa was well stocked and we had no problems. There was plenty of space and everything looked pretty new and up to date. We used the safe and never left valuables lying around. All in all, we had a great time and would recommend this to others. We did the timehare presentation for two free tickets to Seaworld and that was ok. Our rep was nice but the manager that came behind her was a total jerk and that is putting it nicely. We own three timeshares and don't need another.

But I did feel pressured when my salesperson started putting numbers together when I had already informed them that I was not interested in adding anything else on to my package. They left me for a minute only to return with a manager to show me what I was passing up. It did not work the Manager approach me in the wrong way. He started talking about one of my home teams in a negative way which completely turned me totally off to anything else he had to say. I did inform them that I did not appreciate being pressured by anyone. I went downstairs to retrieve the gift card the person that was taking care of that gave me a lot of different place to use the card. But, never did they say or we can just give it to you to use at your leisure. So, I reminded this person of the conversation that I had with them the night before of where and whenever I like to use the gift card. They did not look happy when I said this to them. What really turned me off was the fact that no one at this resort could even speak to me when passing by except for the worker and that includes all races. Shame on you all it has never hurt any one to say hello when passing by. I still wish you all a good life. And this was an eye-opening experience for me that I shared with some of my family and friends.", "Date": "May 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWOW-some!\u201d", "Author": "Darkholme", "ReviewID": "UR15873293", "Content": "I walked in and boy was I blown away!

I would start by saying that the Fountains provides an excellent base for the parks, activities and beaches which are in the area (easy drive to both Cocoa and Daytona Beach). Previous reviews have said that the resort is too far down International Drive, however this is not true, yes it is at the quieter end, but only 10 mins from all the theme parks (Universal, Disney) and literally two minutes from Vineland Avenue where there are the Premium Outlets (discount designer and sports labels, a bit like Bicester in England) and only 10 mins from Major Malls. Sea World is less then 5 mins away. Reception gave us excellent directions (a sheet) to everything we could need and driving in Florida is a lot easier than in the UK as the roads are massive and well sign posted. Just in case anyone is thinking of not hiring a car - don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t! Wherever you stay on I-Drive, you will need one! For us Europeans reading the review, the best way to describe this resort is not like a hotel, but imagine apartment blocks (about 7 I believe) surrounding a man-made lake (not in brilliant condition, water level dropped, algae, poor fountains) but with 2 swimming pools, one with two large kids slides and play area. The resort is part of Blue Green, which are a big timeshare company, luckily we escaped any sales presentations! The hotel has a small bar and shop and the smaller indoor / outdoor swimming pool (the one you will see in photos), a good small gym (lifefitness equipment), games room (pool table, table tennis), arcade room etc. Disappointingly the Pool bar at this pool was not open, and the facilities in general seem a bit understaffed, this may have been the time of year. This meant that if you wanted a drink you had to get an elevator to the main bar. Note to Managers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if this was open we would have spent more! Although we did not make full use of them there seemed to be good activites for kids and adults. The hotel is quite expensive in comparison to the area (drinks, food, tickets etc). The room was very well equipped with everything that you would have in a Villa (washing machine, dishwasher, dryer etc). The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was not brilliant, but typically American and very new. The kitchen is a good size. TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in all 3 rooms, Jacuzzi hot tub and power showers, the air conditioning and ceiling fans are excellent. If I were American visiting, I would take my own DVD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to watch (especially for kids) as the channels are limited on the TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unless you pay for them or indeed pay for films (approx $16). Unfortunately the room was very dirty when we arrived including having the previous occupants food in the fridge which was not pleasant, however the next day it was cleaned better, after that it is up to you as there is no maid service until the day you leave which is not really a problem (you can pay for extra cleans I believe). You are given Pool Towel tokens on arrival which allows you to have fresh beach towels whenever you want them which is great. The staff were not too interested if I am honest and service lacked a smile, except for Security who were very friendly and professional and ran a very tight ship, as with previous reviews, I want to give a special mention to Howard Myers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an ex-pat Brit, first class service and a good source of local information! I was hoping for first class Customer Service in Florida, but unless the staff are tip earning then they are no better then in the UK! I should say that around the lakes are big gas BBQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which you can use \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a great idea. Also there is another lake which has wild life such as big turtles and fish and you can hire rods and paddle boats \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was lovely (located behind the main reception building). Speaking to Orlando regulars (including one girl who worked in timeshare) the fountains is of a better standard than most and if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rent a Villa, then I would defiantly stay here again, although not perfect, it did provide good value for money.

We booked the reservation through Bluegreen Rentals (Michelle) and received a 2 bedroom deluxe villa (6303) that included a living/dining room combination, fully equipped kitchen, 2 bathrooms, laundry area with washer/dryer, ironing board & iron, and even a laundry basket and detergent. One bedroom had 2 full beds and the master had a king sized bed and jacuzzi tub. Both bedrooms and the living area had televisions. The highlight of the villa was that it had a screened balcony with a ceiling fan. We spent a lot of time out there enjoying the view of the lake, fountains, and ducks that have taken up residence there too! The fountains turn on at 8:00 a.m. and music is played throughout the day. Although most of our time in Orlando was spent \"exploring\" the area, we did take advantage of the pool area that is located behind the main lobby. It is truly a beautiful spot to relax, not to mention that the water temperature was like bath water! There were also 2 hot tubs (one inside, one outside), and plenty of lounge chairs. They recently opened another pool with water slides, but we didn't check that one out since we figured the kids would be enjoying that one. We would definitely recommend The Fountains as it's on the quieter end of International Drive and only a few blocks away from Sea World. It also has 24 hour security and you have to have a parking pass to get by the gate. We actually found out how secure it was the first night of our stay. We had arrived about 4 hours later than we had anticipated due to a flight delay, and a 1 hour wait in line for our rental car. So, by the time we got to our room, we were pretty hungry and decided to have pizza delivered. About 30 minutes after ordering, we received a call from security asking whether or not we had ordered pizza. After confirming that we had, they allowed the delivery person through the gates. Last, but not least, Howard who works for security at the main gate is a true asset to the company. Anyone who meets him will instantly know why!

Gorgeous pool area. Indoor and out and actually heated for those of us who live in Florida (85 is just perfect). 2 hot tubs which were really nice. Splash area for little kids. Nice chairs, too, not those crappy plastic things. Air conditioning in the room worked beautifully and unlike most places I've stayed, it was very quiet. I wouldn't do the tour. I have older teenagers so it's not the type of place I'd want to buy into, plus they don't allow pets, but I think you'll like staying there. It's great for littler kids - activities galore. Arcade is small for the number of families that are there. Only one pool table and one ping pong table which were in use constantly. It rained the entire weekend, which made it even more crowded.

Building 5 had a nice view of the lake and could see towards the pool area and I also got to see the shuttle launch from the balcony. The room- Master bedroom is nice with a jacuzzi tub in the room as well as a seperate shower. There is also a door onto the patio from the master bedroom. The bed seemed comfortable but this wasn't the room I stayed in so I don't know how it was to sleep on it. The living room was ok but seemed small. With the pull out couch being used as a bed there was very little room to walk around. The tv's were alright and there was a nice stereo underneath the tv. The sleeper sofa was not very comfortable and I think I might have been better off sleeping on the couch itself instead of pulling it out into a bed. Dining area was a good size and able to seat the whole family ( 4 adults 3 kids). Kitchen was kinda small with the laundry room was off the kitchen and there was no pantry to store food. We were only there for 3 nights and didn't need too much food storage space but I can see how someone there for a week might have trouble storing their food with such a small kitchen. The 2nd bedroom looked nice but I didn't spend anytime in there. The patio area is average sized but the part is that it's screened in so we were protected from bugs and didn't have to worry much about the kids slipping through railings. Had a few issues, there were a few dirty spots in the tub that we cleaned up, there weren't any sheets for the sleeper sofa and we needed some extra pans for cooking and couldn't find any salt/pepper. We called the desk and they sent up sheets and more pans right away and also called the room to follow up that they were delivered. The facilities- The grounds were well taken care of. The only restaurant I used was the poolside bar and my drink was alright and I didn't try any of the food. The pool area is very nice with plenty of chairs and tables for everyone. There is a seperate children's pool and the water is heated and felt great. Prior to arrival we were told that the new pool area would be open during our stay but when we checked in we were told there were delays and that it wouldn't be opening til later.

There were planned activities every day but I didn't participate in any of them. The staff was friendly and the only time we were pressured to attend a presentation was at check-in. The property is in a great location and only about 5 minutes from Disney and very close to the outlet mall.

Many reviewers complain about the hard sell at these resort presentations. If you want goodies for nothing, expect them to get their money's worth. Just say no to the initial offer or expect the onslaught. The clubhouse is nice, but I think the bar/restaurant is better for last minute meals than planned dinner. Outback and a billion other restaurants and shops are a 5 minute drive away. The indoor/outdoor pool is warm like bathwater. There's water volleyball, a pretty decent fitness room, billiards, snookers,ping-pong, arcade, There's a small beach area for campfire/smores night, paddle boats, wading pool. Lots to keep kids of all ages occupied. There were daily activities for those who want to hang around the resort. Karaoke and stuff like that, too.Otherwise, Sea World is a 5 minute drive, Universal is 20 minutes or so. I think Disney's about the same.

It was perfect for us (2 adults, 1 child)- 2 bedrooms with bathrooms, kitchen with breakfast bar, dining area, and lanai overlooking the new pool.

We were about two hours later than we expected and after following the directions to the site where we were to pick up keys and room assignment found only directions to the Fountains and a slip indicating that the required tour was at 10:30 the next day. That canceled all hopes of finding a near by Church to attend since this is Lent. We did find the Fountains and were able to check in after another hour. However, our confirmed reservation was for 2 adults and 4 children and our information packet contained two separate slips one for 2 adults for 2 nights and the other for 2 adults and 2 children for 5 nights. The desk clerk kept this so she could check it out and get back to me. I am still waiting seven days later. I did ask if the tour time could be changed and was told that it was too late to do that. I skipped church and went. It started about ten minutes late because a number of staff were on vacation and several more had not showed up for work. The information was well presented and we were reminded to pick up our gifts after the tour. I was assigned to a very determined salesperson and finally bought a small sampler package which I will use with the grandchildren and/or sisters in the mountains. I could not pick up my gift because my package code did not show what the gift was supposed to be and they would not take my word that it was the Arabian Nights tickets. Since the Welcome Center is not opened on Suinday it could no be resovled. After another hour of my time was wasted, I was told to go to the Vacation Store on Monday and we were able to join the rest of the family over at Orange Lake. What a difference!!! We were met at the gate and giving clear directions to the Condo we were visiting. Much larger and a full size washer and dryer instead of the apartment size. Plus thier kitchen has a pantry so you have space to put food instead of just dishes to eat it from. Monday we attempted to get the gift issue resolved and ended up almost two hours at the Welcome Center/Vacation Store and left with a promise that it would get resovled and I would receive a call on my Cell phone. We then went over to spend the afternoon with my grandchildren's other grandmother at Orange Lake. We were very impressed with the staff again and grandchildren spent the afternoon in Orange Lake's water park. Lunch was good and not too pricey for a resort. The Grandparent's condo in one of the high rises was very roomy and their whirpool tub is in the master bath instead of the bedroom so they have more privacy when using it. When we returned to the Fountains I attempted to clear up the gift issue and was told that it was too late to come back the next day which was the day of the wedding that was the main purpose of our trip to Florida. Had to wait while the clerk was attempting to resolve an issue of a couple who had been quoted one price and was being charged nearly double. Friends from Ocala visited me Wednesday and we were disappointed in lunch except for the maintainance person who took care of our leftover and empty containers for us. Thursday we made a brief attempt to resolve the gift issue again but decided that we had wasted enough of our vacation and that since we had been promised calls be both the Fountains staff and the Vacation Store that we were going to one of the parks. Friday we took off early and spent the day at the beach. When we returned we did use the indoor-outdoor pool and it is as nice as what you find in the average Holiday Inn. I wanted to use the regular check out Saturday Am since I still had not received the call about the mix up at check inn but the line was long and not moving. Did overhear another conversation about the rate being charged was not what was quoted so I am expecting mine to be 75% or 80% more than quoted as that was what the couple complaining Monday pm, at the Vacation Store and Sat am had experienced. I will have more in writing when we use the sampler points at Boyne in Michigan and Pigeon Forge in Tennessee. If we do return to Florida it probably will not be the Fountains.

This has its pros & cons. They provide a letter in your room explaining this fact. Their construction doesn't start before 7, but adjacent property construction (was to far from or rooms in building 6) sometimes does. The resort entry is under construction. It can be hard to find sometimes just for the fact it can change daily and does not have a very visible permanent sign. Most buildings are 7 stories high. Suites consist of 2 plus rooms and I believe have a really good layout for noise, comfort, etc. This doesn't mean noise isn't a factor. Our family had two suites next to each other and could not hear loud noises from the other suite, but we could hear loud kids from above and below quite well. In the building we were in the Master bedrooms had another source of noise from suites on other wing of our building and another building (7) across the pond. A couple per room can go to morning presentation for $150 towards park tickets. Only supposed to be -2 hours, but ours took +3. Pros: Location - located between Sea World and Disney parks. Stores and restaurants are plentiful within 1-2 mile drive. Clean - Rooms aren't cleaned daily, but they came quite clean. Room Amenities - TV/cable in all rooms, washer/dryer, iron/board, safe, kitchen had rags/soap, dish washer, blender, coffee maker, pots and pan, dishes, etc. Large Pool & hot tubs - Pool is partial indoor (rectangle w/volleyball area including net) and winding outdoor. Depth between 3.5 to 5.5 ft and Heated. Kiddie pool about a foot deep and plenty big enough for many children. 2 Jacuzzis pool side. Outdoor Jacuzzi is surrounded by vegetation giving it a private feel. Cons: Noise - It can be a factor, you also might get lucky. Construction - Noise, area closures. Sheets - bottom not fitted, if you expect lots of \"messy\" sleeping bring your own. Otherwise you probably won't notice them. Pool side bar often closed (never open during our stay). Other notables: Internet connections - In room DSL (cat5): $10 a day, $21 for 3 days, $35 a week. I hooked up my personal wireless router to it with little difficulty. Free wireless in clubhouse and poolside. 2 public computers in clubhouse. Activities - Plenty of them, but nothing really special. 2 people at bingo, no participants at pool scuba ($15/$25). Parking - by permit only and sometimes can be a ways away. In conclusion, it's a nice place for a family vacation, but go somewhere else for your honeymoon. If what your looking for is a quality family vacation resort it's a good to excellent value.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cgreat place\u201d", "Author": "WalesRussfamily", "ReviewID": "UR13087056", "Content": "we stayed in the fountains 5th jan 2008.

I rang reception and told them and within 10mins someone came round to spray, the next day more appeared so rang again and someone was suppose to come round and sort it while we were out (but found out at a later date no one did that day) The next day i had to ring again as they were everywhere, in the kitchen,bathroom in our draws, I'd had enough by this time, i told them i wanted to move, It was 9am and my hubby's birthday, i'd arranged for him to do the shark dive at 10am, The lady rang me back to say she'd got another room but i had to leave my room before 10am, I explained that we had plans but would cut the day short and be back for 3pm to move, She said we couldn't do that as they were busy and needed the room i wasin for other people to check into, I tried to explian to her that she couldn't let other people in as the room clearly has a ant problem, Anyway the manager phoned me back and said to stay where we are today and they would get professional people in and do a full house clean at no charge, I did agree to this for the sake of my hubby!!! The next day came and yes you guessed it more little visiters.... Rang them again but this time it took them nearly 2hrs to sort another room out, oh and it was about 6pm not before 10am as they'd said before, We moved to block 5 over the way which was lovely, the only problem i had there was the bloody spinkler on the grass came on about 7.30 and the water kept hitting the window (we was on the ground floor) and waking us, And we did have two other visitors on the balcony which was a frog and a lizard they got through the rip in the net. The only other incident that happened was after a couple of days of the move i realised i hadn't seen my jewellery, i panicked and looked everywhere, i went to reception and asked if i'd left it behind in the other room, but in the back of my mind i was thinking of all the people that had been in there, i know thats bad but i did panic, I was told that they'd look into it and get back in touch, i never heard nothing, i kept ringing them, i went back to reception and not once did anyone get back in touch with me!!! I did how ever find my jewellery i had hidden it in my hubby's shoes i think i did it when the cleaners and them came and had just forgotten about it with the move, I did try and ring them a few times but i think they just stopped picking the phone up to me. I'm not sure if you know about this or not but there is no free cleaning there, I didn't know, but if you want the place cleaning it is $25, and the other thing is dont use the rooms phone to ring home, for a 17min phone call to England it cost me $47 which is about \u00c2\u00a325 thats more then \u00c2\u00a31 a minute,scandalous amount. After all that moaning i would stay there again (if they'd have me) as it was just the right location for us, very central, and very quite around you, apart from the new build.

There are no fitted sheets on the beds, so we awoke most mornings to find ourselves twisted in the bottom sheet and lying on the mattress pad - YUCK! The activities cost money for everything rather than being free as we have experienced at other resorts, also the activities people called the unit everyday to list what was happening.

The upside to this however is that unlike some of the bigger resorts all is in comfortable walking distance. Two gripes however. Maybe it's because I run a cleaning business at home and maybe I am picky but I was very disappointed with the standard of cleaning in the Apartments. We stayed in a standard room in the first week and it seems that Housekeeping bypasses the edges of the hard floors when it comes to cleaning. There was dirt and hair etc especially around the edges and some of the cupboards were not the cleanest with a fair amount of water stain at the bottom. It seems that a mere brush of the floors rather than a good old fashioned dust and mop is used. The standard of dusting also left a lot to be desired. In fairness after I mentioned it to the Management Housekeeping was round within 15 minutes and sorted the problem out. The second week however we moved into a deluxe room and I found the same problem there, this time however I decided to not bother mentioning it.

The apartment was HUGE; it had everything we needed and more; even a jacuzzi in the main bedroom. Each of our two kids (14 and 12) had their own double bed and bathroom in their own room. The washer/drier was a great bonus as we could do a wash which only took about 20 mins and a dry and the clothes would be wearable the next day. The location of the Fountains was excellent for all the locations, within 5 miles of Disney World and not too far from the Universal area and free car parking too with no problem getting spaces. Premium Outlets was only a mile away. Pool was great although the pool entertainment was a bit too loud ( I like loud music but not when relaxing by a pool) and you need to appreciate Bob Marley's music as their reportoire consisted mostly of his music. Food was nice at the pool but the drinks and ice cream was costly. The kids enjoyed the pool games even involving us adults on many occasions. There was building work going on but we were never aware of it and never heard or saw any evidence of it. Staff were very pleasant although the reception staff never got back to me with a few enquiries I asked of them. The lack of any 'free' light housekeeping, even just to change towels, was not really acceptable. It was nice also to be able to go to a bar at the end of a long day; even the karaoke sessions were fun and well run.

They are horrible. I now bring my own king sheets and fitted mattress pad. That's how bad they are, but if that's the only real complaint I have on the comfort of the suite. I'm happy. After our last stay, we wrote a comment to Bluegreen that we didn't like that they didn't have a bolt lock on the door. With small children (one with autism) fascinated with opening and closing a door with no bolt. We had to put a chair at the door. But that has been rectified and they now have a bolt lock high up the door. I love that the porches are all screened in. This is also a plus with a child with autism. He cannot climb over the railing. I guess there is one more thing that I don't like about the design of the room; however, it has noting to do with the quality or cleanliness of the villa. When you have small children and the master suite is in the back of the suite, it's a little scary to put them to sleep in the very front (right near the front door). I also don't like that the windows are at knee level. When my children were 3 and 1, my husband and I switched off sleeping up in front. Getting back to the perks, it is very nice to have a nice grocery store with in a mile. You can save money by purchasing your groceries and eating in. Kitchen is fully stock with all the pots and pans you need. The Fountains is also far enough from the craziness of Disney, but close enough that you don't feel like you are driving hours to the parks. The distance was perfect enough for us to come back for a hour or two and go back into the Magic Kingdom ,after our baby took and nap and our special needs child was able to run around a fairly large villa.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "sarah22_2000", "ReviewID": "UR8051688", "Content": "As a bluegreen vacation owner for two years and never staying in a resort, this was a great way to start out.

Be aware that a metered tax/ cab from Universal should only set you back $22 at most. Aim for Premier outlets ( 1 junction down ) where you will find a convenient Publix with ATM & Wallgreens next door. Lobby impressive, and balcony view over the pool. Request block 2 if possible, next to club house, & overlooking the lake. Major works in progress on site to double if not treble size of complex. View of the building site therefore expected, but you dont come to orlando for the view ! Everything you need in appartment, including mid week towel change. 2 bed & 2 bath & sofa bed easily accomodates 6.

We decided to stay at The Fountains for my hubby's b-day wk-end. We checked in after 6pm on Friday night and checked out at 945am on Monday. The hotel room we got was 2 bedroom/ 2 bath and it was beautiful! It had washer/drier, which we only used once to wash a few towels thinking we didn't have enough or that they wouldn't bring us new ones... but towards the last day, we found more towels inside the cabinets!! We stayed in building #5 on the fifth floor and our view was nice. (facing the lake) The bed was comfortable but I don't think there's enough pillows though. The jacuzzi was nice but the shower in the master bedroom, the curtain wasn't long enough so the water got outside. The front door wasn't very secured, it only had one lock and it was low enough for my two yr old to open it. (And she did plenty of times!) They need a chain lock or something more secured. There was two elevators in our building but one wasn't available all the time. I think it was Sun morning, that we got in one elevator with another family and the elevator stopped at each floor on its way down but we couln't let anyone else in, including the housekeepers because the elevator was full. (I wonder how long the housekeepers had to wait to get to where they needed to go!) The staff was friendly especially the Spanish, older gentleman at the bar. (Nor sure if he's name was Eddie) We ordered food to go on Sat and Sun and he was there both times and he remembered us by the second day. The food was good BUT the price was a bit too high. We went to the pool on Sat and Sun and it was awesome! There was a DJ on Saturday and he was playing different games. I like how they have different activities every day throughout the day.. Unfortunately, we weren't able to do any of them. We did watch the puppet show while we waited at the bar for our food and the show was good, my daughter enjoyed it. **If you go to the pool, you have to ask for a towel at the activity center and they'll ask you for your room #.
