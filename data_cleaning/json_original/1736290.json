The bellboys were very helpful and friendly too. The room was spacious, modern, extremely clean and very comfortable. The gym was one of the best I have used in an airport hotel and the hotel itself is very modern. The only thing that sadly let this hotel down for me was the breakfast. The staff here were very rude and didn't welcome or offer help to any of the guests when they came in. They just stood and gossiped amongst themselves. This was a shame as everything else about the hotel was excellent.

The walk from the terminal was maybe 5 minutes, which saved from having to use the shuttle service. The hotel staff was extremely friendly, always willing to help. Aysun was a great contact to make sure everything was booked correctly online. Gockan, the front reception clerk was extremely helpful. We had a day trip to Izmir and wanted to see Ephesus. The company that the hotel goes through wouldn't fit with our flight schedule, so he offered to help us find a company that would. He even offered to see if any of his friends on facebook would be willing to take us on a tour. This was superb service, and the day trip was great! Thank you Gockan. As for the rooms, they were extremely large with 2 double beds, a sofa, and a large desk that spread across one whole wall. The bathroom was also large; the shower was a little tall. I'm 5'1\" and had to be careful getting out of the shower it was that tall. The rooms were SPOTLESS! I couldn't believe the great job the cleaning staff did. This hotel was so quiet it is hard to believe that it is connected to an airport! The hotel restaurant was very nice, however the buffets were pricey. It was a much better deal to order off of the more reasonable a la carte menu. Everything that we had there was excellent. The only complaint about the hotel has to be the scent machines. While it was a nice scent, it was a bit overwhelming in the lobby. The hotel is a bit far away from anything. Nearest mall was a 15 minute cab ride... Do not stay here if you are looking for nighttime entertainment. We had no need for it, so it was no issue for us. Our stay was excellent though and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place near the airport. Again, thank you to all the staff!", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Airport Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rajandani", "ReviewID": "UR126260473", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights as my flight into Sabiha International was arriving near midnight and I did not want to take chances with local taxis at that hour.

Hotel is modern and rooms are large with all modern amenities. Staff and service is great and very friendly. Hotel is clean and gives a very modern look. Everything in room works well. WiFi is available with password provided by hotel and it is surprisingly very fast and worked all the time. Breakfast spread was good and had large variety fruits, breads, cheese, salad and limited cooked variety. Hotel is also very moderately priced. One can even stay at this hotel and still do descent sightseeing and come back in the night. Hotel can call for local taxi from airport.

The AC worked well, the bed was comfortable and there was no noise to be heard from outside the room. We used the bar to enjoy a couple of local drinks and enjoyed the warmed nuts that were on offer to accompany the drinks. We then moved into the restaurant which again has nice food. Breakfast was nice too, with a range of different foods. We decided to walk to the airport since we had backpacks, which took all of four minutes.

The hotel is situated next to the airport and within walking distance of the exit doors (turn left as you exit arrivals and walk to the end of the building line. You will see the hotel to your left. Walk down one flight of stairs and you are there.) Although it is situated alongside the airport, NO plane noise was heard in either of the two rooms we used.

Taxi costs 10-13 Tl (approx \u00c2\u00a34-\u00c2\u00a35 each way) and takes about 10mins.

Lunch was not included in our stay arranged by the airline (I do not have any gripe with them). However, on entering the hotel restaurant, it took a clear fifteen minutes before a waiter appeared with a menu.......we ordered two Chicken sandwiches, and it took a FULL HOUR (yes one full hour) to be served with our meal, and this in a restaurant in which I and my wife were the only patrons (the waiter indicated that they also had a party of 25 people in another area that were being served as a reason for the delay)......!! Amazing excuse in a hotel this big.......and then the waiter refused to book the bill to our room and requested CASH or Credit Card payment immediately........This matter I took up with the manager, who eventually agreed to credit the hotel with a sum from my credit card for payment of any incidentals at my expense over and above what the airline were paying for.....AFTER WE HAD HAD TO USE MY WIFE'S CREDIT CARD TO PAY FOR THE LUNCH! As seasoned travellers and property owners in Turkey I was astounded at the apparent LACK OF TRUST shown by staff of this hotel, particularly as our stay was enforced, and not of our own making, and as we were at the end of a 3 week vacation (which also started in Istanbul) our cash funds and things such as toiletries were at a low ebb. Even worse then that we find that there was ONE tiny bottle of shower gell in the bathroom, one small bar of soap, and NO HAIR SHAMPOO, and in the room itself - no tea or coffee making facilities, and the mini bar was devoid of EVERYTHING, it was stone cold empty. The manager was asked re tea/coffee facilities and his reply was a rather candid 'we don't have enough to put them into every room.' I was, though, very fortunate, at THE SECOND TIME OF ASKING to receive an adapter plug (which allowed me to use my laptop to complete much necessary business work caused by our delay) and of course write a review! At the time of writing we are awaiting an evening meal which we have been informed we 'have to take from a set menu'....I am not holding my breath, and at 12 TL for a (very small) beer and an incredible 6 TL for an (even smaller) cup of tea (chay) I don't think I need say any more.
