The room was clean bed firm and low but a great sleep for us and the staff extremely friendly. They spoke English and very helpful regarding \u00a0directions and sites. One thing to consider: if calling for pickup at the airport, it may be a while since the driver is also the front desk clerk working dual jobs when busy. This is not a problem getting to the port or airport on time. The breakfast bar is excellent however I suggest if you are coming from the states and a coffee drinker for you to bring some artificial sweetener with you as we always do. They didnt have any also coffee cream since they use milk. If you are new traveling to Europe make sure you have a converter for curling irons however a basic adapter will work on other electronic devices. Internet access was excellent and free for all devices. Also the phones did not have id on how to call the front desk. Just dial 9. \u00a0Remember to put you key in the wall for lights and air to work. Taxi fare to or from Placa de Catalunya and tours bus lines was approx 17 euros per visit.

We were first put in 211, the room with no AC and next to the boiler so it sounded like we had witches living in our walls! After asking to be moved because of this, they said they could only make arrangements for the next day, ok. We were then put in 208, thinking this would change things, on entry the room was cooler and less stuffy. However once again, and I think this must be for every room, any neighbouring flush or use of water facilities comes flowing through your room and during the night the AC packed up. Then at 0830 started, what sounded like, a door banging and bed dragging olympics, or at least someone was trying to claw and slam their way through our walls! Oh and the spa, not much of one at all! The pool is a square of 3mx3m with the altering height from 1m to 1.20m, and lots of attachments. If there are children there then expect all the jets to be on and them diving in unsupervised. The hottub is a very intimate 2 man-er with a huge cold stone overhang so dont expect to get comfy. There's also a subtle hint of cheesiness. The sauna is a box that only gets to 20 Celsius, might as well stay in the room. And the \"spa showers\" is just four showers that sequentially blast you with either hot then cold or cold then hot. Their benefits are explained but I think a little far fetched. The one redeeming feature is the steam room, the only positive to come out of this hotel. We have one more night here, lets hope for some quiet.

The hotel is very close to Bogatell metro and from here only four stops to Uruquinaoa which is a small block from Placa Catalunya but the area in which it is situated is decidedly seedy and run down looking but didn't feel unsafe if you kept to the main carrers which were well lit. The hotel itself was lovely with big rooms and a large atrium and bar area on the ground floor but the restaurant was closed and only a limited range of bar food was available. This all looked as if it was pre frozen and had just been heated up. One of the children with us asked for a plain cheese pizza and was told only ham and cheese was available. Surely not rocket science to remove the ham before serving? My partner and I decided to explore the area and find an alternative eating place. We were told the hotel was 15 minutes walk to Port Olimpic but it was closer to 30 and we aren't slow walkers. The area in which the hotel is situated looks to be semi industrial and most of the restaurants in the immediate area were closed on Sunday night. Port Olimpic was fine and we had a very nice meal there on the waterfront. We liked our room with two generous single beds pushed together to make a huge double. The bathroom was very large with both bidet and toilet but the door stop was set in the floor right at the base of the toilet and I stubbed my toe a couple of times. Also the shower is over a bath with high sides and a bit tricky to get out of if you are starting to stiffen up. At first I thought the selection of toiletries was poor but later discovered we had been given two male ones instead of a male and a female version. The spa was amazing. Just the thing for aches and stiff necks and the pool was a pleasant 28C. The main disappoint ment here was that there were a group of pre-teens who didn't seem to have parents with them and were splashing about rather a lot. However this wasn't the fault of the hotel.

There's also a supermarket about 15 mins walk away. Like a lot of other cities, grafiti every corner of the streets, but I dont feel unsafe during the day. The room is big, clean laminated floor and bathroom. The shower works well. The AC works well, but when u turn it too high, the water starts to drip down the ceiling, but it's ok when the setting is lower. The bathroom is down the hallway of the room, so the room doesn't feel steamy after shower, there're also windows in the room that can be opened for fresh air, although our room is facing the street, so can get pretty noisy if u leave windows open at night when u sleep. There's a gym here, it's ok, nothing special. Breakfast is not included, water is only complimentary on first day of stay, so make sure to pick up some on the way back from metro, water in hotel is expensive, no need when u can spend less than half the amount a block down the street. Cab ride only 30 mins from airport, \u20ac30, save us hassle and time from taking the train! Only 15-20 mins walk to the beach.

During winters, only the heater works. Air conditioner does not. So, your only choice is to lightly open the window in order to make the room a little bit colder. That is ok, but when you do that, you start listening the typical street noises because the street on which the hotel is is not so calm. Other avoidable small annoyance is that to use the safe you have to pay 2 euros a day. This was the only hotel in Europe having reasonable level that I saw that. 2 euros a day does not bankrupt you, but sounds unnecessarily unpleasant. It is also far from the main attractions.

I bought a 2 day ticket for the Bus Turistic on line from the company Viator which was cheaper and just handed in the voucher at the tuorist information at the airport. It came with maps and a book of discount vouchers which was very useful.

We were on a 4xnight (Sat to Tuesday) B&B Tariff and our trip was a revisit to do the sights in slow time since our last visit was a one day call off a Med cruise liner (whistle stop guided tour - crazy). We found the breakfast (Buffet) more than ample but rarely varied (beans on just one day was the only difference) - the service was slick and there was no queing either early 0700 or late 1000 - the Tea Bags werent to my liking but hey ho I didnt expect them to import English just for me !! - The Toasters were particularly slow but on the up side it was almost impossible to burn the slice(s). The cleanliness in the restaurant was very good with a new/clean table cloth for each new table setting. We found the double room adequate in size and quite comfortable - the bed whilst two singles pushed together wasnt a problem on the join. I never did discover whether the \"complimentary\" soft drinks/water in the mini fridge were actually free but I doubt it . For a 4* as advertised it would have been nice to have tea/coffe making facilities in the room - but we were made aware from previous reports that this was not on the list of facilities. To use the swimming pool required joining the spa entrance key charge at 8 Euro per day - since we were out and about till 2200 most days we did not partake - but yes you do need a swimming cap if you use it !! The nearest METRO Station is literally just round the corner and really is just 2/3 stops from a stepping stone to the centre. We thought it was good value and very easy to use once you get your head round the 5xlines interchanges. Once your down there you dont have to pay more than the one gate entry charge to complete your journey to any metro location. We found the most economic deal was a T10 ticket which is valid for a year from the date of purchase and permits 10 entrances onto the system (thus two people can share the one card @ approx 8 Euros). If your only using it to transit for walking tours that just a total of 4 entrances per day (there and back for two people). We were in Barcelona for 5 days purchased two T10s and finished with two unused which we donated to a happy traveller on our final return trip to the hotel to fly home. The baggage store was convenient on our last day (booked out by 1200 but didnt fly home until 2230) - no charge - locked and secure with tickets to reclaim - great. My hotel bill was the cheapest yet (just 20c for two tel calls - this to confirm tranfers etc) From this you will gather we ate out toatally save for breakfast (absolutely Paellaed out now). We didnt feel threatened walking in the area of the hotel at night (midnight even) - the whole of the adjacent street areas was more or less deserted of locals and minimal traffic. We wound our way back about 4/5 streets from a fairly good restaurant late one evening on foot and didnt see a soul. Oh just one tip - we didnt spot it until about day 3 - just outside the nearest Metro Station BAGATELLE or similarly spelt there is a water fountain similar to those dotted around variuosly in the City centre - handy for topping up your water bottle prior to getting on the Metro and lasts until you either choose to purchase fresh or top up again - we didnt suffer any tummy upset from partaking of these water supplies. If you are not in favour of this source then there are good chilled supplies in a cold coin/slot cabinet on floor one in the hotel - I never investigated the cost though. As I said - twas OK for us. Recommend the hop on hop off Blue and Red/Green open top bus system/routes with a two day ticket (29 euros each but you can get reductions down to 22 euros each and discount entrance fee booklets to other attractions by purhasing through the hotel) - We used it to get our bearings on day one and to create a must see list from the commentary(s) then worked our a round robin route for some of the more distant attractions on day 2 - therefater we were on foot closer into the centre and utilsed the Metro.

Admittedly the area is not the most picturesque, but we never felt unsafe walking back from the metro at night (the nearest station is Bogatell, about 5mins walk away). It is an industrial type area, which just meant that it was quiet at night and there was quite a bit of building work going on during the day. It is on the edge of town, but the metro is very convenient and inexpensive (with aircon!), and you can walk to the park area (Parc de la Cuitadella) within about 10-15minutes, and beyond that to the old town within about 20-25minutes if you're a fan of walking. The hotel itself is lovely. The decor was a bit over the top colour-wise (with bright yellow, green and red in the reception and bar), but had been done to a high standard and was very clean. We checked in early, so our room wasn't ready, but we were able to leave our bags in the secure storage area and head out to begin exploring Barcelona. When we checked in later, we found we had been given one of the largest rooms (according to the fire escape floorplan), which also had a balcony - try to get a room on the eighth floor for that, there are lifts! The room was decorated more tastefully, in black and white with green accents, with a lovely marble bathroom. It was all spotlessly clean and tidy, and had aircon. The hotel also has free wi-fi, which we had no trouble accessing. The breakfast was good, it consisted of a large continental-style self-service buffet, including cereals, meats and cheeses, pastries, toast, egg and bacon, fruit, yogurt, juices, tea and coffee...something for everyone! It was kept well stocked, even when we went down for breakfast towards the end of the session (7-10am). We never used the restaurant, but the menu sounded appetising, if a little expensive (though having said that, with the poor exchange rate against the \u00a3, all of Barcelona worked out to be a little expensive!). We used the swimming pool a couple of times, it wasn't the biggest but it was never busy and we saw it as a bonus rather than something we \"needed\" out of the holiday. There was also a jacuzzi, steam room, sauna and small gym (though we didn't use it...too much like hard work when you're on holiday!). All these facilities were clean and well kept. there were also lockers to keep your keys/towels etc in. We got one lovely surprise from the hotel - it was my birthday during our stay, and presumably the maid saw my cards and someone checked my passport, as that evening room service brought up a small bottle of champagne and a card, compliments of the staff! It was a lovely touch that made our stay even more special. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely use this hotel again.

Although there was absolutely nothing suitable on the menu, a delicious 3 course meal was soon rustled up - Artichoke soup with fresh olive bread, followed by a mixture of roasted Mediterranean veg- including fresh asparagus and artichokes!! The meat eaters in the family enjoyed their meals too and all the portions were huge. Breakfast was also very impressive - we all particularly enjoyed the tortillas. We didn't use the pool or gym area- simply because we didn't have time. We did however go to look at the pool and although small it looked very attractive. The Pere IV is not as central as some other hotels but we walked to the Sagrada Familia in less than 30 minutes. A taxi from the centre of town cost us 6 euros - so cheap that we didn't even try the underground. We would be more than happy to stay in this hotel again - and look forward to the next time.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol.

It was booked for me as I am on a business trip. Last night and this morning I barely slept at all because it was so noisy. The floors in the rooms are not carpeted and because it is an old hotel there is little or no sound proofing between the floors and as a result when someone walks across the room above you it sounds like thunder and if someone drops something your room practically shakes. There is also no sound proofing between rooms and I was woken up in the morning by the room next door playing dance music. Whilst I did stay on a Saturday night the noise I experienced cannot be attributed to the day of the week because I was disturbed by the kind of everyday noises of people moving around. The rooms are very small, the bed covers are not nice and the complimentary soaps etc are cheap. Our room looks out into an internal atrium so has no view. I suspect 50% of the rooms share this outlook. As well as having no view, the atrium is very noisy because any noise in it echoes and bounces off all four walls. Nothing is what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. The decor is horrible despite what other reviewers have said. Who in their right mind would paint the walls orange and fit a red carpet? It is very dated. Furthermore, the area is not pleasant at all. It is surrounded by mechanics garages and similar businesses. There is nothing nearby of any interest and the area feels dirty and not particularly safe. The only benefit of the location is it's proximity to Razzmatazz night club! It is a good 20 minute walk to the centre. I suspect this hotel has received it's 4 star rating for some reason like the fact it has a swimming pool and a large reception and restaurant. It certainly isn't because the rooms and area are nice.

Once we were checked in, and pointed in the direction of our rooms, it was a different feeling. Yes the d\u00e9cor is a bit dated, but the rooms were clean and for the amount of time that we planned to stay in our rooms, it didn\u2019t discourage us in any way. We had no view at all from the room that we had, just looking at a blue mosaic wall that looked straight into other guests rooms. Complimentary soft drinks were left in the refrigerator, and this was nice after our journey, these were replenished every day. The area around the hotel, is a bit run down, with lots of road works going on but we could not hear any of this in our room. A 20 minutes walk will take you to the sea front and marina at Port Olympic, here you\u2019ll find lots of bars and restaurants, but be warned, down by the marina you\u2019ll pay top price and there\u2019s not a lot on the plate, so go a little in land for a better deal. We found the shopping mall just off the front has some very good places to eat at a more reasonable price. If you don\u2019t want to stray too far from the hotel, I can recommend Xiscarexantar restaurant, which is: when you come out of the hotel, turn left, then left again just a 2 minutes walk. Good food at a great price. The breakfast in the hotel was fine, with a good variety on offer each morning, take your sunglasses, as the dinning room is again very brightly painted. You will find bright colours everywhere you go in Barcelona, not only in the Pere IV. This I found out later, is the Gaudi influence. The Bus Turistic is a good way to get around and see the city and get your bearings a 2 day pass will cost you 23 euros, but well worth it. The Sagrada Familia is a must see for everyone, so too is the Nou Camp Stadium even if you\u2019re not a football fan, you will love this tour. Walk around at your own pace, no one rushes you, sit in the stand and soak up the atmosphere. And at 11 euros it\u2019s a steal. Walk around in Barri, the Gothic area of Barcelona, and take in some of the most fantastic architecture, and not forgetting the Rambla for the street entertainers. We had 5 days in Barcelona, and I can say we had a great time. Yes the hotel is a bit dated, but it\u2019s clean, and the staff are friendly.

One night we had a three course (set) meal, 2 bottles of wine, 3 coffees (I had an extra) a brandy and a tia maria - no optics ! - all for 32 euros ! Absolute steal ! On passeig St Joan de Borbo is what is probably the best sea food restaurant in Barcelona, El Rey de Gamba. Their paella is superb, we had that but the locals were having simply massive seafood platters - they were immense ! Back to the hotel, perhaps it isn't in the most aesthetically pleasing of areas but it ain't faf from town and if it was any closer it would be more expensive - swings and roundabouts !

The only downside is the location. Firstly, the address is not Avda Pere IV 69, this is the back of the hotel which doesn't have any signs outside. The Front of the hotel is 128-130 Carrer de Pallars. This caused a bit of confusion with our transfer from Girona airport and the taxi drivers had not heard of the hotel when trying to get back at night but I had the correct address written down so that helped.

If you had been to Barcelona, you wouldn't even be considering the Pere IV because you know how great those other areas are. Around the Pere IV, you'll see a lot of graffiti, car repair shops, pool halls, bars, and empty buildings, no nice restaurants that we could see.

Although not a 'pretty' location, we found it absolutely fine - it was quiet in the evenings as there is very little traffic (and people come to that) and we felt quite safe walking back from the Port Olympic area late at night. The staff at the hotel are extremely helpful and the breakfasts are great - every you could possibly want. We also appreciated the free soft drink in the mini bar. If you are planning a stay at the Pere IV I would strongly suggest you request a room to the front of the building. The room we had was in the middle of the building and although the room itself was well appointed and had everything we need it didn't get much daylight (very little infact). We travelled from Prestwick Airport to Girona Airport and the bus transfer was very easy. Just behind the baggage carousel there is a little window where you buy your bus ticket. There has been a change to where the bus drops off/picks up, this caused us a sliight hiccup on the way back to the airport as our taxi driver obviously didn't know about the change and dropped us off at the old pick up point !! The bus now leaves from the Estacio del Nord - please make sure your taxi driver knows this. Barcelona itself is a wonderful city. There is just so much to see and do. We thoroughly recommend the 2 day bus pass on Tourist Bus, it's well worth the 21 Euros.", "Date": "May 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery Good but.....\u201d", "Author": "DCJSwindon", "ReviewID": "UR3357467", "Content": "Nice hotel, Staff very very helpful nothing too much trouble, people on reception especially helpful.

The hotel was comfortable - I chose this one for the pool facilities and although small, we used them every night. Yes, the location looks dreadful but I felt quite safe. We used the metro regularly; it is fantastic. We walked to the beach (15 mins) once. To and from the airport we used taxis (25 euros at peak traffic time) as two girls alone we felt safer initially doing that, but now I would feel fine about using the public transport system. Yes, I would stay here again. It is certainly quieter than the Ramblas hotels in the evenings (and minus the 'ladies of the night' that congregate there). The staff were exceptionally helpful - advice, reassurance for a neurotic mother, and maps! Do use the 'Bus Touristic' to get your bearings around the city and visit the key places! Top floor of El Corte Ingles in the Placa de Catalunya does a self-service lunch, with amazing views over the city. But I digress from the hotel... Hotel is great, rooms are clean and comfortable and well-equiped (except tea and coffee stuff, which is through room service), restaurant is fine, 19e for 3 course meal incl. wine, and so to is the room service food. Don't worry about the location - we wandered around it all and felt safe.", "Date": "April 9, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Salles Hotel Pere IV", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d280922-Reviews-Salles_Hotel_Pere_IV-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$104 - $172*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Pallars 128-130</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08018</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "280922", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/55/1f/f5/fachada.jpg"}}
