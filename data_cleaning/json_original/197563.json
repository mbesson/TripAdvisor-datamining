It is further South than most people would stay but it only cost us about 12Euro each from CDG airport after catching the RER (B) into Gare De Nord and then catching Metro Number 5 straight into Place d'Italie. In all took about 60 mins from CDG to the Hotel with all the signs really easy to follow at the airport and stations so need for expensive taxis if you only have one wheeled suitcase each. Once at the Hotel, Place d'Italie has great bus and metro links to all the main aspects of Paris so it is really easy to get around and see all the sites. The Hotel Itself is ok \u2013 better than I had envisaged. We were greeted very warmly and found all the staff very accommodating and friendly. We asked for a top floor room as we had read that it can get noisy. We were in room 723 which is ok but has a sloping ceiling so feels a lot smaller. Friends were in room 722 which is a much better shape. Room 724 looked by far the best on the top floor but I guess you would have to pay more for this. Bed and pillows were really comfortable. Area a little noisy being so close to the centre of Place d\u2019Italie and did get woken a couple of times with police sirens, but no problems with noise from adjacent rooms or noisy plumbing etc. Room had TV with BBC world news and tea and coffee making facilities. All in all an enjoyable stay \u2013 no hassle or problems!

Some others reviews suggest some of the rooms here are on the cramped side. Perhaps I was lucky. Perhaps others are a little fussy. I found the size to be just right. - Comfortable bed. Two single beds were pushed together to form a double with a double sheet and quilt. - Good lighting. Lots of options and a large window. - Large flat-screen tv mounted on the wall. Around 40 channels with English news channels and general entertainment channels in French, German, Italian and Spanish. - Controllable air-con. - Warm, comfortable decor and nice wood furnishings. No noticeable wear and tear. - High standard of cleanliness. - Really quiet. My room was at the back of the building facing into an inner courtyard. There was no traffic noise at all. Lift shafts were next door to the room but made very little noise. - Mini-safe in wardrobe, nice towels, free toiletries and face cloths, hair dryer, telephone, tv guide and other magazines all included in the room. - Free and fast Wifi in all areas of the hotel. No excuse these days to charge hotel customers for wifi. - Friendly and helpful staff. - 24 hour bar. - Really nice location. Near an interchange metro station and lots of restaurants and shops. - Away from the tourist areas so you're mixing with real Parisiens living their lives. - Breakfast included in the room price. A typical continental spread of breads, cheeses, cold meats, cereals, pastries and boiled eggs. Really lovely. The Bad - A really narrow bathroom. I actually rather liked it because it was different and quirky. That said, the toilet was about 30cm away from the other wall so using it was difficult even for a skinny guy like me. People of larger proportions would probably have to sit on it sideways. - The shower was right in front of a window. The glass was slightly frosted but there was no blind or curtain. On top of that, a bright halogen bulb lit up the shower area like a shop window, so showering at night would probably only be for the brave. - Central faucet on sink. It's one of my hotel bugbears. Seems every hotel has them these days. Really annoying to use. - During one afternoon, I placed the 'Do not disturb' sign outside my room. I had walked a lot that morning and fancied a nap and had noticed the chambermaid was working on my floor. After a short time, I was woken up by the phone ringing. It was reception wanting to know when I would be vacating my room. It's my personal opinion that if a hotel has \"Do not disturb' signs, they ought to respect them and that if I'm paying for a room for three nights, it should be my decision whether I want the room to be cleaned or not. It's worth pointing out this was the only customer service issue I had though. The Verdict Despite the annoyance of being woken up unnecessarily, I really enjoyed my stay at Hotel La Manufacture and would highly recommend it to you. It's well-appointed, well-run and offers everything you could possibly need. Rooms are a good size, quiet and comfortable and include all the necessary extras. It's often a requirement of people visiting Paris that they avoid the chain hotels and stay in a typically Parisien hotel. This hotel would meet such a requirement since it's set in a typically Parisien-style building (with large iron main entrance door) and is independently-owned. Next time you're in Paris, I'd say Hotel La Manufacture is definitely worth at least short-listing.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "pghenry", "ReviewID": "UR122154115", "Content": "Nice and clean room.

Just as a sign as to how great the staff of this hotel is: Erich, behind the front desk, loaned his personal iphone/iPodtouch charger to my wife, when she realized that she hadn't brought her own. The hotel, as noted in a previous review, is located in the 13th arrondissement. A newstand near the hotel was still selling copies of Le Nouveau Observateur, proclaiming, in a cover story that the 13th was now considered \"the new Left Bank,\" meaning that a lot of cool Parisians now live there. The #27 bus, which runs down the Ave. Gobelin, near the hotel, is the best bus you can ride. Huge panoramic windows, and a route that goes through some of the most iconic spots in Paris. At one point, you think you are living in the opening credits of \"The Divinci Code.\" The hotel is clean and cheerfully decorated. The rooms are of modest size, but more than adequate. Across the street are two cinemas that have many of the best of the film releases of the moment. (We saw Speilberg's \"Tintin.\") There is a fine, modern mall at nearby Place d'Italie. The Rue Mouffetard is a short walk away. This is one of Paris' best market streets with about 50 good restaurants. There is a wonderful bakery around the corner of the hotel, if you sign up for a room without the buffet breakfast (bakery with seats and a typical petit dejeuner). Free wi-fi in room.

As I heard another guest telling the front desk staff, \u201cWe will never stay anywhere else in Paris but here in the future.\u201d I concur for the following reasons: -- The friendly front desk staff, led by Nadine, impressed me even before I arrived. They were very courteous about making dinner reservations for me a couple of weeks before my arrival, at my request via email. They always responded promptly and were efficient and fast. This also was the case during our stay, as well. They double as concierges, because this is not a large hotel. --The lobby, the elevator and our bathroom were decent-sized by European standards, and we had a balcony on a quiet street! -- The hotel is in one of the least touristy arrondissements, so it was refreshing to spend time in an authentic neighborhood, unlike my first stay in Paris near Notre Dame many years ago. Consequently, prices for everything were the cheapest that I saw anywhere, such as at the nearby terrific pharmacy and the magnificent patisserie. -- Which leads me to my next point: There are many restaurants, caf\u00e9s and sandwich places nearby. In fact, the patisserie near the metro was one of the best patisseries I found in Paris with lots of tempting choices. My only regret of the entire trip is that I didn\u2019t sample more goodies there. -- Speaking of the metro, the hotel is very close to one of the best metro stops in Paris: Place d\u2019Italie. Most of its lines go directly to desirable destinations with only a minimum amount of transfers occasionally. Consequently, we only took taxis only twice during our weeklong stay. -- And, finally, even though there is a police station next door, we did NOT hear one siren the entire time.

Squeezed into an already small space was a \"cubicle\" bathroom which only a professional contortionist would enjoy. A horrid plastic shower curtain masked a shower booth which lacked any spot for soap or gel. Not a scrap of paper or even pencil were available in the room (presumably one could have asked at the front desk), and, more gravely, NO WATER. This is penny-pinching at its worst with no thought for the well-being of the guests. Breakfast, at an ambitiously-priced 13 euros, was a flaccid buffet of cheapo cheese and supermarket salami. Don't even think of drinking the buffett coffee but ask for a \"serious\" coffee from the waitress who serves cappucino etc on request. One is seated on pleasantly designed cushions in a very narrow breakfast room, presided over by a fierce-looking matron in starched maid's uniform who clearly brooks no nonsense.

It was a fantastic weekend. The stay at the La Manufacture hotel Paris was brilliant. All the staff were helpful and very polite. The rooms were great and breakfast good..We found the hotel a very good location, with only short Metro rides to places of interest. Very good, we totally recommend it and would return there again. We also want to say that the hotel were especially great as we left quite a lot of English money in our room by mistake and they were most helpful in getting it back to us in the UK at no charge.. Thanks again Nadine ( Head Receptionist)", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "\u0130stanbul", "Title": "\u201cgreat service great stuff .\u201d", "Author": "Shakespeare07", "ReviewID": "UR105456152", "Content": "Honestly from reception to waitresses all stuff were very helpful .

The lobby decor are so tastefuly done with beautiful colors. Breakfast is fantastic and the service is wonderful; the location is very close to the public transportation. The staff's English was quite good. They are very friendly and helpful; they give suggestions and directions to where you want to visit. What impressed me most is when my daughter realized that she had left a treasured possesion at the hotel room after we were back home in California. The hotel staff found it and offered to mail it to her for free! Talking about a 3 star hotel for 5 star service......
