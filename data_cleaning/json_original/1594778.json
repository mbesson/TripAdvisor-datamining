There was one tiny bathroom (the door handle fell off when we got there). They came to fix it and it fell off again. They returned again and fixed it the second time. The toilet would not flush correctly (imagine staying in a cabin with 9 people and having 1 toilet that did not flush). The only other toilet on the premises is a disgusting port-a-potty!

This was a trip for my husband's 60th birthday, and was all about fishing on Table Rock Lake. From the first time I contacted them, the Kettells were so gracious and welcoming. I found the reservation process easy and hassle free. The property is well cared for and it is obvious that the family takes great pride in it. Our cabin (Trout Run) had it's own 2 person jacuzzi tub - and I highly recommend it! Long trip from Michigan and long days on the water made for sore, stiff muscles that were greatly soothed by that tub! We appreciated the fact that there were pots, pans, silverware, plates, etc., and all appliances worked perfectly. A charcoal grill also came in handy for those hot days. There was a nice wrap around deck and chairs and also a small screened in porch area which we did not use. We did use the free WiFi and the cable TV - which meant we got to keep up with our favorite shows. The weather ranged from over 100 degrees to under 50 degrees so we had the opportunity to use both the air conditioning and heat - both of which worked exceptionally well! I cannot review the resort pool/hot tub - those were closed during our stay. However, I can review the Lowe's Bass boat the the dock. The Bass boat was a great value from our standpoint, came with a brand new trolling motor with foot control. There were also two Hummingbird GPS/Fishfinders. Large boat lockers were available to store our fishing supplies so we did not have to carry everything back and forth from our cabin. Rick supplied valuable information about places to fish and my husband was able to land some of those famed Table Rock bass. Although it is really not a part of the resort, I absolutely loved the drive to the resort. It is about an 8 mile drive that twists and turns through some of the loveliest area I have ever seen. I suppose for some that road would be a negative - but for me it was a big plus. It meant we were not on some busy, noisy road, and lent a peaceful, quiet atmosphere to the resort that one closer to Branson would not have. The Lakeside also boasts groceries and a small restaurant, and my husband became a regular consumer of their delicious chocolate malts. This was a trip of a lifetime, and I am so pleased that it was spent with the Kettells, They are a gracious couple and we wish them all the best.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Peters, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great trip!

My granddaughter,6, loved getting the spray-on tattoos, she came home with 6 of them...they are offered at the store for free but the artists(Kettell kids) work on tips and they did a good job and were fun to talk with. We rented a golf cart our last day and really enjoyed the use of it, we went to the lake on it but also just drove around Coney Island looking at all the houses and views. We all enjoyed swimming off the dock, 50 ft. of water so my grown sons and my granddaughter loved diving and cannonballing off the dock. We also had a picnic there the last day as there are picnic tables right on the dock. All in all, I would recommend Lakeside 100%, the family is very helpful if you have a question or a problem, the facility is wonderful. We will stay again.

The ownerw, Stephanie and Rick Kettlells, are as friendly as they come. The location is as close to Table Rock Lake as you can get and is very convenient to Branson, Silver Dollar City and most area attractions (including golf). The resort is clean and well cared for though somewhat dated. We call it quaint and love it! The general store (and \"carry out\" restaruant) is a plus for quick meals, special treats and forgotten items. The swimming pool and boat dock (with picnic tables) are wonderful. We understand that RV sites have been added this year although we have not personally seen them yet. We first stayed here in 2008. 2009 was our second year coming to this resort and 2010 will be our third. We do a simple family \"quasi\" reunion here, ranging from 10 to 27 people, and have a blast every time. My wife and I would recommend the Lakeside Resort & General Store, and it's owners Stephanie and Rick Kettells, to anyone, with or without children, for a fun, simple, inexpensive vacation. Bring your boat, your fishing gear, or RV if you have them. We think you'll enjoy this place: we certainly do! Steph and Rick, we'll see you again very soon!

This fabulous dock area gave the family a wonderful place to hang out, swim, float, and fish. The dock area has a place to eat also and we ordered pizza/walking tacos/icecream all from the resorts General Store. The owners or their kids delivered the food right to us while we were swimming! What a nice break for Mom! The pizza was the best pizza we have ever had! The cabins were clean and beds very comfortable. We rented a boat for a few hours which was enjoyable and gave us the opportunity to see more of the really clean, Table Rock Lake and its surroundings. The traffic on the ground and lake is not busy at all which we found made the vacation even more relaxing.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ridgedale, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Vacation on Table Rock Lake\u201d", "Author": "LVTRL", "ReviewID": "UR66630705", "Content": "Nice and very clean, owners were very nice and friendly.

The drive from West Branson is scenic with views of Table Rock Lake nearly the whole way. If you want to be close to the tourist activity, you should choose a motel in Branson. However, if your desire is to have a quiet place to enjoy the serenity of the lake, you can't beat this location. The cabins are clean and beds comfortable. I love to be able to enjoy the music of birds early in the morning, sitting on the porch looking out over the lake. The thing I love most is NO traffic noise.
