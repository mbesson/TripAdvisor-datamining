The small kitchenette was a real benefit especially if you got hungry in the evening. But the selection of kitchen utensils available wasn't that big.

BUT, we went down and voiced our concerns to the lady, and she did a quick check and handed us keys to a room on the 3rd floor for us to have a look! we did a quick check and took the room on the 3rd floor without hesitation. our room was at the end of the corridor on the 3rd floor, and there was a lift in the hotel so it was prefectly fine. this room also had a small area kitchenette, which had a microwave, hot water flask and kitchen untensils. there was also free coffee and tea satchets which we appreciated. there was a double bed against the wall, and a lovely heater which we dearly missed when we were out of the hotel in the cold, haha! the windows opened fine and overlooked eardley crescent which the hotel was on. there was a little cupboard, mini table and 2 chairs. the room was small but cosy and i loved it. the water pressure in the shower was a little weak and took awhile for the heater to heat up, but wasn't a problem for us. there was a good supply of shampoo and soap and we had no complaints. no heater in the toilet though so it was a little chilly. we both had huge backpacks but managed to pack/unpack our stuff without a problem, and we tried to put our stuff on the chairs and table so the cleaning lady wouldn't have a hard time. we actually had a pretty good stay and for the price we paid, we aren't complaining! everything is expensive in london and quite frankly i think some people do nitpick when it comes to rating hotels. coupled with service from Ryan (Traveltura), we definitely enjoyed our stay at Boka Hotel, and would like to thank the staff for their help. The guy at reception always smiled and greeted us, and helped give us directions when we asked. breakfast was always a delightful mix of bacon, beans, eggs and toast, there was also cereal and the usual juice and coffee/tea. there was free wifi in the hotel which worked best downstairs in the dining room! overall we had a good stay here and i liked our room 307 (i think), studio-ish feel to it!", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel Ever!\u201d", "Author": "MrsFlores99", "ReviewID": "UR122794164", "Content": "I booked this hotel because it was cheap and looked decent in the pictures, but I regret booking this hotel. First, I asked for a double room with a queen bed for my husband and I. When we checked in the receptionist never told me that the room she had given me had twin beds. I had to get on the elevator, go thorough a dark corridor, thru a door, down a flight of stair and there was my room #203. The room had a skeleton key and you could see the whole room through the key hole. Once we entered the room, the sink had tape on it because I assume it leaked and so did the faucet. The bathroom was clean but once we entered the mini room where the beds were it had a horrible stench. You could not sleep from the smell. I went down to reception to ask the person at the desk that I need a queen bed not 2 twins. She told me that at the time she could not switch the room because she had a booked hotel and I would have to sleep there the night and then maybe they could switch our room. My husband was not happy with the response nor the room and we checked out that same day! We did not sleep there, and we got ourselves another hotel. It was not a hotel more like a hostel! The room we got was very depressing as well.

I don't require much from a hotel, just a comfortable bed and the ability to take a warm shower. In these 2 aspects the Boka failed. In contrast to last year the bed that I had this time was very uncomfortable. I could feel the springs poking into my skin. ( I had to sleep with my coat, 2 towels and the comforter under me to minimize the discomfort of the springs. I probably should have asked for a different room but it was the weekend of the Royal wedding so I was sure they were filled to capacity plus we had already fully unpacked and were very tired from the transatlantic flight and hadn't slept for close to 48 hours. On the first day we were able to take warm showers. It was the middle of the day so there was warm water available. Although there was no water pressure and water came out of only about half of the shower head, but I can deal with that. I just couldn't wash my hair for three days because there was not enough water to rinse it well. The following morning I wasn't so lucky. We woke around 7:30a.m. and by that time all of the hot water must have been used up. So if you want to take a shower do so in the afternoon. Other than those two things everthing else was fine. The room was at the back of the building and had a nice bay window with a view of the garden. The Bokas garden has been cleaned up a bit & I'm sure when the room renovations are done it will be fine. I could see the neighbors garden and it was beautful. The location is great, only a short 5 minute walk to the underground and I really love the neighborhood. We only had a frige not a microwave , but that was fine. I appreciated having a frige to put drinks in. The breakfast was good, your typical English breakfast. And everyone that worked there was very friendly. I feel a bit bad writing a bad review and am not sure if I will give them one more try. As I said the matress was REALLY uncomfortable. Please manager of Boka Hotel, if you are reading this. Please get a new mattress for room 314, or at the very least get a foam cover. I'm sure the water pressure and shortage of hot water is something you don't have control of but you can fix the bedding situation.

There is a cooked egg, bacon, beans, sausage and toast. Plus cornflakes. - don't expect a scenic view. The bad: - rooms are basically clean but don't look under or behind the furniture. The furniture had obviously never been moved to clean, there was a thick layer of dust. I also found used boxer shorts under the bed! - similarly with the showers etc - don't look up! - some rooms don't seem to have curtains. I have stayed a couple of times and once, on complaining, I eventually got some curtains after a couple of days. - similarly furniture and facilities are not consistent across rooms. - some walls/floors can be thin: ok as long as your neighbour isn't noisy. - I may have picked up fleas from the hotel. No, you can never confirm this but the doctor said hotels are the usual place and the timing was right.

The manager was not in until 11am and I told them to ensure that the manager called me and left my business card.

I poked my head around other rooms and I probably wouldn't want to stay there- yes maybe I'd agree with the rest of the reviews then. The BEST part about this hotel though is really the location. It's less than a 2 minute walk from the Warwick Road entrance of Earl's Court Station (zone 1), buses, and less than 5 minutes from an M&S Simply Food, Tesco, and of course all the restaurants and conveniences that Earl's Court road has to offer. The thing you have to remember is that London is expensive! So Boka is a great value if you pick the right room. I paid about 44 a night, it's better if you call in to book rather than using online brokers that actually make you pay upwards of 20 more for the room. But it's all about the experience- you'll fall in love with Boka's value and weird english charm. It's definitely perfect to stay in with friends, maybe not for a romantic getaway.

The pro's of the hotel are the ideal location for small price: about 200 m from Earl's Court Underground. Which is already within the city-zone district! It's extremely easy to find, and also with heavy luggage very well to reach. The check-in was amazingly well arranged. We booked it months ahead, and it was perfectly found and reserved. Within seconds we had the forms to fill out and got the key. The first amazing surprise was: we got the same room! I mean: identically the same room (twin bed), with small kitchen and fridge and view at the yard at the back. So excellent for comparison. When we arrived, the London-weather was improving, actually at days it became quite warm. So when entering the room, we noticed immediately that the heating was on, and the window was opened(!). There is no knob to turn the heating off, so we had to ask at the reception to send someone up with tools to turn off the heating. After a while, the girl from the desk was very friendly to do it herself. However, we later noticed she had really turned up the heat! The next morning the heating was immediately shut down completely. And we were able to sleep with closed window. The room was clean, though the light in the shower/bathroom was initially broken, later it was more like a stroboscopic experience, and finally they replaced it and it was fine. The breakfast was identical: nice english breakfast (I still have the impression that the continental is the toast-only version of the english-breakfast) with sausage, beans, and fried egg with bacon. Wonderfull to start off the day! There actually were new chairs, and the service was swift. Boka is excellent money: it is of course not a 5-star hotel, but what it delivers is funny and decent. The funny part is where something is not really working as expected. However the staff was always willing to fix the problem. It's an ideal hotel if you want to explore London by day, and use the rooms to sleep or freshen-up. And? Did it change? Well, the service is definately improved!

Everything was clean but we didn't get very much in the way of room service - we had to ask for clean towels after a few days and bed not made etc. Front desk service was much better- when we asked to extend our stay we were going to move to another room but they took it upon themselves to rearrange the bookings so that we didn't have to move. Much appreciated! London is an amazing but expensive city and the Boka was a perfect base for us. It is certainly the best hotel that we have stayed in in this price range (and even better than some more expensive and better TripAdvisor-rated hotels) due to the advantages of space, privacy, kitchenette and location.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark Aalborg", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, no unpleasent suprises, supreme location and price\u201d", "Author": "Lars_qwert", "ReviewID": "UR34499016", "Content": "Stayed at Boka hotel for 3 days with my mother and my 2 brothers (Mom being 50y, me 23 and brothers 21 and 18 - Family get together) we just wanted a place to stay close to the center and metro, as we spent all day and evening in the city.

The sheets for example were sparkling white. See my photos for a better idea. It had a communal toilet and separate shower at the end of the hall. They were very small probably converted broom cupboards, but again spotlessly clean (you will need to bring your own shower gel etc) The walls as previously mentioned are pretty thin. It was very warm overnight, a bit difficult to get to sleep. In the morning breakfast was in the basement again a bit dated decor but spotless breakfast ws lovely and the staff were great!.
