The room size was pretty decent for a family room. Comfortable for 4 adults. Got it for about SGD240 per night including breakfast, which is not bad at all by Singaporean standards. Location wise it is pretty good in the sense that it is close to Bras Basah MRT and YMCA bus stop. In fact, except to the Zoo we took the MRT to most of the places. There is a Kopitam food court right opposite which is open 24hrs. It costs about SGD25 to the zoo and the bird park. About SGD 30 to the airport. SO it was quite convinient. Orchard road is right behind the hotel. The only minus is the MRT construction going on in Bencoolen street. You will have to walk to Bras Basah road to catch a taxi since most taxis dont come into Bencoolen street. The waiters in the restaurant are a little rude sometimes.

We were therefore happy to find Stand Hotel at a fairly reasonable rate of 160 Singapore Dollars for a Deluxe Double Room.

We had taken two rooms as we have two teen-aged kids, the rooms were next to each other. Its basically a no frills hotel, but very clean, bathrooms are clean too. Room size is comfortable. LCD TV in the room. Air conditioning worked fine. Rooms were cleaned everyday, towels changed. You have to make a refundable deposit of Sin $ 20 for a hairdryer, which is refunded when you return the drier to the reception. Staff was helpful and cordial. A huge breakfast was served on the house - toast, noodles, pancakes, cornflakes, juice, milk, eggs, sausages, hash-browns..... Work for the Bencoolen MRT station is going on close by, but there is no mess and the sound is not disturbing with the windows closed. Wasn't a problem where we were concerned. Its not a fancy hotel, but comfortable and safe for a family. The location could not have been better, with Dhoby Ghaut and City Hall MRT stations, the famous Orchard Street, the museum, Raffles City Centre, all within easy walking distance. The harbour front is not too far away. And for meals, there is the Kopitiam Hawker Centre just across the street facing the hotel. All in all very convenient.

Had booked via email with their helpful staff (thanks Philina). All we really wanted was somewhere to sleep off our jet-lag in between seeing sights, and the Strand was just fine for this. The location is perfect for busy visitors. A few minutes from main shopping (Orchard Road) and tourist sights (Raffles, Little India, riverfront). MRT (tube/subway) station just around the corner. Convenience shop (7-Eleven) and 24hrs food hall (Kopitiam) across the street, other cafes nearby. Other good points: Good value given the location - family room for 5 + breakfasts cost S$280/night (\u00a3140/US$225). Polite and helpful staff - refused to be tipped until we insisted on leaving some $ to be shared out. Family room was basic but spacious and clean, with TV and fridge. Breakfast was basic but plentiful - a cooked plate Western style (bacon, eggs, etc) plus self-serve of noodles, cereals, breads, fruits, drinks. Not so good: Construction site right outside the front door, which will continue until 2017 - however, we had a front-facing room and we weren't bothered by the noise of work. Hints on Singapore: Use the MRT whenever possible - it's cheap, frequent, safe, and air-conditioned. Don't miss the Zoo and the Night Safari in the north of the island - the best way there and back is a Singapore Attractions Express (SAEX) coach. Nearest SAEX stop is in Prinsep Street, 1 block from the Strand - there are only a few per day so check timetable in advance.

Good thing was we were out of the hotel before 9am most of the time so we were not bothered much with this.

Even though most of Bencoolen street where the hotel is located is closed due to MRT construction, our taxi was still able to bring us right in front of the hotel. Check in was fast and easy; we were asked to pay in full right away which was just fine with us because that would mean fast check out. Extra charges apply when you make local calls but very minimal (about 20 cents). Amenities were basic: toothbrush and toothpaste, all-in-one handwash/bodywash/shampoo/ conditioner, toilet paper and paper slippers. The bath tub and attached shower are a big help for tired feet after going around. The room also had a small fridge, safe, TV and thermos/hot pot. There is also free internet access although sometimes the signal gets lost but over-all it was ok. Another option would be using the computers at the lobby which would require you to drop 1 dollar for a 15-minute usage but computer is old and a bit slow. Even if there was very noisy construction outside, it was not a problem at all once you are inside the hotel. Going around tourist spots from the hotel was not a problem because the hotel is very near 2 bus stops and MRT. There is ample guide and information for bus routes and fares in the bus stops. Breakfast is hefty - sausage, bacon, hash brown, baked beans and eggs served on a platter plus you can still choose from noodles, pancake, french toast, bread, cereal, coffee, juice or tea from the buffet. For us, this is more than enough to start your day. Staff were helpful - gave clear directions when we asked for advice plus all the brochures necessary for all activities you may want to explore are available in the lobby near the elevators. They can also call a taxi for you if you need one. On our last day, it was raining hard but we didn't have to worry about waiting for a taxi. Ask for a higher floor with view.

We stayed in this hotel back in 2005 on a family trip & had good memories of it, so decided to stay here again. We got a Standard double bedroom for 6 nights, and paid SGD 140 per night. Complementary breakfast was included. Singapore is a very expensive city so this was a good deal. Booking was a hassle. This hotel is not listed in any of your regular online booking sites (including tripadvisor). Their website doesn't provide enough information on rates/room availability either, so we had to email back & forth to sort out our booking. Wasn't excruciating, but still was a hassle. On the plus side, this hotel was available, during peak holiday time. We got a surprise when we got off the taxi. We were dropped off on top of Bencoolen St: The part of Bencoolen Street where the Strand is located is closed off to traffic and is essentially a construction site. Apparently it is going to remain this way until 2016 (they're building an MRT line). I would've appreciated it if the hotel had bothered to mention this information to us beforehand. The staff were friendly enough given the Singaporean standards of \"friendliness\". The doorman insisted on a tip for pulling our bag down the stairs and putting it in the taxi. The room was sparse & comfortable, working airconditioning, the beds were fresh and clean, but can't say the same for the rest of the room. The windows hadn't had a clean for ages and the carpets were a bit icky and were not vacuumed properly. The bathtub fittings were aged and were a bit worse for wear. But the bathroom was clean. The rooms were cleaned daily. The complementary breakfast consisted of a buffet (tea, coffee, juice, pancakes or french toast, fruit slices, noodles, toast, bread) and a set meal of eggs, baked beans, sausages and bacon strips (no bacon for halal). It's no fine dining restaurant but this was quite alright and filling. You get your \"breakfast vouchers\" daily, from the reception. Excellent location despite being in the middle of a construction site. The Bras Basah MRT station is a few meters away, and not too far from Bugis or Dhoby Ghaut either. The decor was a bit questionable. It felt as if someone started prettying the place up and went \"that'll do\" half-way through.

Cons: - Hotel was dated and tired and in need of a refurb. Public areas and lifts had an old musky smell. - Room decor also in need of an upgrade (lime green walls are quite a sight!). - Very worn carpet. - Poor lighting in room. Pros: - Good service during booking and check-in. - Good service from pleasant doormen and friendly housekeeping staff (they looked like retired uncles & aunties). - Huge room, with 2 Queen beds and 1 Single bed, and abundance of bedside counters, shelving, bench space (perfect for laying out the many items that come with a family). - Ample wardrobe space and space to lay out suitcases. - Clean and comfortable beds and pillows. - Separate WC (very clean) with a counter lavatory, useful for washing and drying children's drink bottles etc. - Separate Shower (very clean) with a shower head that can be adjusted to suit children's heights (very mummy-friendly for giving little kids a good shower), another pedestal lavatory which is wonderful for the morning rush. - Fresh towels supplied daily, hairdryer supplied on request. - Bar refrigerator, kettle and in-room safe, all very useful. - Free wifi, very very useful for daddy's work and for children's online games (bring an extension chord and adaptors, there is only 1 power s.o. in the room). - Great hearty breakfast set every morning (2 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 bacon, hashbrown and baked beans) and you can help yourself to the buffet spread of fresh bread/toast with quality butter/jam, cornflakes, fresh fruits, fried noodles, milk, coffee/tea, juice (we can't understand how other reviewers can say that the breakfast is terrible?). We had to bring little containers to take-away the leftovers of the b/fast sets that our little kids can't finish (great for snacks at a later time). - Hotel location is handy for transports, museums, food and shopping.

There's the Kopitiam food court across the street - my regular tea/coffee spot; Further walking will lead you to Fort Canning Park - a beautiful spot for a morning run, or and afternoon stroll; a walk North up Serangoon road will lead you straight to Little India; staying on Bencoolen and heading north-east, will lead you to the start of Bugis market; a walk south along Bras Basah Rd will lead you to raffles.

I had my wife and 2 small kids, otherwise I would've been satisfied with a hostel. We were there 4 nights and was totally satisfied with the Strand. It's also near an interchange MRT, Dhoby Ghaut, where 2 MRT lines cross, so you can go in 4 directions, towards Orchard Rd (shopping), the Zoo/ Night Safari, and towards Sentosa island, our prime destinations (you need to change to a bus after the MRT to get to the Zoo or Sentosa). Little India is a ten minute walk away. Marina bay, the Flyer (ferris wheel), etc. are not far away. Halal Indian roadside cafe is a block away (<5 mins walk). 24 hr seven eleven store was across the street. The Bencoolen Mosque, a travel agency, money changer, and many hotels were all next door, on Bencoolen street. I did quite enough of research on the internet, looked up the hotels within my budget that were being offered in the Singapore Airlines deal and near Orchard Rd, particularly nearby hotels Bencoolen, Ibis, and two in Little India. The cheapest of these, yet decent & comfy, was the Strand. At SG$ 100 (approx. US$ 70) with breakfast for two (my children ate free too), it was a good deal. I also checked out the Fortuna hotel opposite 24-hr Mustafa shopping center (Little India), but it did not have a cafe/restaurant, and the next door MRT station (Faber Park) is not as main a station as Dhoby Ghaut. (note: with kids and a pram, its not easy using the MRT and changing trains.) Getting a taxi or public bus, or bus service to the zoo, were also easy. If you don't like this hotel, you can check out any of the numerous hotels next door on Bencoolen street and be sure to like one in your budget range, e.g. hotel 81, Ibis (an international chain), Bencoolen, Rendezvous, etc. The YMCA is also nearby. I booked it over the counter, room availability was not a problem in early August. When we checked in, the only thing not working was the fridge, which was changed on our request. Facilities included a 25-30\" LCD TV (no cartoon channels for the kids though), a fridge, an electronic safe, a smallish cupboard for hanging clothes, telephone, central air-conditioning that worked, internet connection, and a good, clean bathroom with hot water. Iron with stand is provided free on request. The staff was friendly, but the reception staff need more etiquette, though they were helpful. Two computers with paid internet are in the lobby, as are free brochures of Singapore, a standard feature I think supported by the Singapore visitors center. All in all, a satisfying & comfortable stay. I would recommend it to anyone who is money/expense conscious, also fellow Muslims & people from the Indian subcontinent, as the mosque is nearly next door.

I emailed each hotel I was keen on to see whether they could offer a better rate than the numerous websites.... The Strand Hotel is located near Orchard Road, - I had decided earlier on that the hotel would have to be within walking distance to an MRT Station. On the map, it looked near enough, but in reality, it takes about 2-3 minutes walking which can be painful if you have been walking all day! The rate they offered me was among the cheapest I got and after reading the reviews here, I decided to stay here....and I am glad I did!!!! The hotel looks a bit dated - lobby isn't fancy and the cafe is small and simple but we were happy. We never wanted to pay to stay in a fancy hotel where we wouldn't be using the facilities anyway. Firstly the room is HUGE......3-4 people would be lying on the floor in sleeping bags and it would still be comfy. There is a huge LCD TV but not too impressed with the reception. We got clear reception of AXN though. There is a kettle and 4 satchets of instant milk tea and coffee. No complimentary mineral water. I would have preferred mineral water. Soap is via a dispenser - one near the sink, the other at the showering area. Towels are provided, as were a pair of toothbrushes complete with toothpaste. I brought my own shampoo and soap so it wasn't much of a problem. The bathroom is clean but I think they should work towards removing the tub and replacing it with a shower cubicle which should be more practical. Service was efficient - check in was painless. One night our air cond went kaput and I called down. Within 5 mins someone came to look at it. When he had determined that there was indeed something wrong, someone came to look at it. The next morning, the air cond went wonky again and we told the reception before we left. When we came back, there were people fixing it. Next thing we knew the air cond was fixed. Yippee. Breakfast is simple. Cornflakes and milk and toast. Coffee and tea. That's it. On the second day I ordered eggs. $3 for 2 eggs done any which way you want. Across the road from the hotel is KOPITIAM, an air conditioned foodcourt which was persistantly full. Next to it is a 7-11, very handy for midnight cravings. Transport from this area is ABUNDANT! There is a bus stop right in front of Rendezvous Hotel next door - you can get practically anywhere getting a bus here. I took buses here to the Esplanade and Bugis and the airport. Buses to Little India can be gotten on Prinsep St just on the road behind the hotel. Of course, it helps that Singapore has such an efficient transport system. The Singapore Art Museum is about a minute walk away. Chijmes and Raffles is also within walking distance. When we stayed there, they were having a Night Festival in Stamford which we didn't go to due to having very very tired feet......what a shame. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this hotel enough.

As a muslim, we wash immediately after we do our thing, not just wipe it with toilet tissues. So, this is a bit problem. Had to find a container or something to get the water from the bath tub. Second problem, the hotel did not provide a guide/sighn for muslim prayer. I really think this is saddening coz Singapore also has Muslim communities and the tourists do come from various Muslim countries.

When we pointed out that it was 9PM \u2013 way past the hour of any standard late check out offered by a normal hotel, not to mention the fact that they were double renting the room, she acted as if it was a perfectly normal procedure and that we should be happy with waiting for them to clean the room (despite having traveled all day and being tired). Exhausting our patience Ms. take-it-or-leave-it told us we would now need to take a small room with two single beds if we wanted to stay here. We advised her we were paying for a double, which had been confirmed, and pre-paid for. After a heated argument with me accusing them of renting the room by the hour for prostitution, purposes, which she never denied, my husband learned from a male front desk clerk assisting a client in the same situation, that there were two rooms available in the hotel; the single and a \u201cspecial\u201d double.

The Manager then offered her apologies and after first asking us to pay more ($10) for the room, finally agreed to let us have the room due to our astonishment at their dark-age business practices. The \u201cspecial\u201d room we were given after defeating the Barbarians is best described as pimp meets vampire; dark grey walls, curtains and carpeting with some bizarre purple, snakeskin covered headboard/ceiling contraption that served no purpose including that of attempting to be a hip decoration.

The paint was chipped and missing in several places and the wood counters were also chipped and stained (Vampire rituals perhaps?) I\u2019d hate to see the standard rooms if that was a special room.

It's OK as a budget stay and the position is great but the website does lead one to expect a bit more than it delivers.", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "ish-uk", "ReviewID": "UR5546986", "Content": "stayed for 5 nights the room was ok everything looked a bit old but was a least kept clean. like a previous reviewer said the sheets were old and a few times had cig holes in them. thought the location was good near a mrt station (5 mins walk)had a seven eleven opposite and a small hawker centre. staff were nice and helpful.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cBudget Quality Indeed!!\u201d", "Author": "AshJones", "ReviewID": "UR4564681", "Content": "I stayed in the Strand Hotel for 4 nights in February 2006. There can be no doubt that this hotel is very well situated for walking to the hustle bustle of Orchard Road and also to Little India and the Raffles complex. However, as a regular world - budget traveller I was deeply disappointed by the general standard of this establishment. My room was described as a 'Special room'. Just what was 'Special' I never grasped. Perhaps it was the fact that the shower/toilet room had a glass door (this in practice meant that both myself and my girlfriend took to using the toilet facilities at the nearby high class hotels to avoid the dignity removing process of visiting the lavatory in full view of one's partner). Perhaps 'Special' referred to the cigarette burns in the blanket or the radio beside my bed which had exposed live wires, who knows! Also disconcerting was the fact that the front of the hotel is a gathering point for local prostitutes. Every evening we returned to the hotel from an night out there were at least 2 girls working the street directly outside the main doors of the hotel (believe me, I was not mistaken, I'm a cop by profession and I know what I saw). Also alarming was the fact that the hotel has a pool table in the verranda area at the front of the premises, this in turn always attracted a large group of swarthy individuals who loittered at the front of the hotel until midnight on every night of my stay. On the whole I would describe my stay as unsatisfactory, even my initial e-mail to book the room took 3 further e-mails to confirm that the Strand had recieved my request. The Strand was dated in decoration and not to the high cleanliness standards that I saw in evidence at other Singapore hotels. I felt generally unsafe in the area immediately outside the hotel and the room fell below acceptable standards in decor and furnishings. I would suggest potential visitors look beyond the budget price and consider paying a small amount more for a higher standard hotel. I would not recommend this hotel to any visitor to Singapore and would certainly not stay there again.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cStrand Hotel: Great value\u201d", "Author": "Erniecat", "ReviewID": "UR4145948", "Content": "I stayed at the Strand Hotel for one week. It was my first visit to Singapore. As many of you know, the Strand is a budget hotel in a very good location, on Bencoolen Street, near the intersection of Bras Basah Road. I thought the location was ideal because it allowed us to walk to either Orchard Road or to the city center, near City Hall MRT and the River/Esplanade area. Also, I was within walking distance of several MRT stations, with Dhoby Ghaut being the closest, at 5 minutes away. Dhoby Ghaut is a great station because two MRT lines stop there, including the one that takes you to the Night Safari and Zoo. Other MRT stops fairly close by were City Hall and Bugis. As for the hotel itself, I must say that I was extremely happy there and thought it was pretty incredible value for the money. I paid S$85 per night, which included service and taxes. My room, which had one large bed, was very large. I liked it because half the room was sort of like a living area, with a table and nice big chair, and plenty of empty space. And there was plenty of space to store our clothes and other stuff. There were two drawers in the living area, attached to the desk, and there was a decent-sized closet near the entrance. What I really liked was the bench that was attached to the back wall that extended along the periphery of the living area. It was a great spot to keep things like brochures and other papers, or anything that normally would just clog up the dresser, bed or table. The room was clean and decorated nicely. The bathroom was modern, clean and functional, though not particularly large. As usual in Asia, the shower head was designed for someone considerably less than 6 feet tall. My only real complaint was that the room did not have adequate lighting once the sun went down. There were small fixtures scattered about, but an overhead light would have been nice. But this was not a very big deal. The service was really good. Whenever I needed anything (usually an extra towel), I would call and someone would come to my room within 1-5 minutes. Once, someone was there in around 20 seconds. Even though the Strand is billed as a \"budget\" hotel, it does not feel like a budget hotel at all. The lobby is fairly big and the reception desk is long and well serviced. There is a bellhop/doorman to help get you a taxi. The hallways are very nice and wide. The lifts both work great. Everything is very, very clean and well-maintained. Very professional staff. Things like this really make you feel like you are staying in a very decent place. The bottom line: If you are not seeking luxury, and are looking for an inexpensive yet very functional hotel and do not care about facilities (no pool, no gym), then you probably can do no better than the Strand while in Singapore. I've stayed in many hotels in many places, and cannot recall a hotel that offered better value.", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEconomical, Clean, Quiet, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "Rob1", "ReviewID": "UR3556361", "Content": "Conveniently located on Bencoolen Street near Bras Basah Road, the Strand represents good value at an economy price. Across the street from the slightly pricier City Bayview and beside the first class Rendezvous, this high-rise hotel boasts an excellent central location, within walking distance of many Singapore attractions, the MRT, and \"hop-on/hop-off\" tourist buses. The lobby is clean and well lit, a few steps above street level, with a wall of glass between the lobby and the street, and a sheltered entrance. The staff is very accomodating but not as knowledgeable as a concierge in a five star hotel. The rooms are large and spacious, the beds firm and comforable, including the \"roll-away\" beds, and each room comes well equipped with chair, desk, mirror, side chairs and table, good cable television, mini-fridge, room safe, and lots of closet and storage space. The bathrooms are well finished but spartan, with none of the usual amenities like bar soap, toothbrushes, or shampoo. There is one liquid soap/shampoo dispenser inconveniently located on the shower wall (bring your own bar of soap). The single sink is set in a large counter space, with bathtub and shower on the opposite wall. Entry to the room is by magnetic swipe card, which also controls the lighting. The rooms are well lit and the air conditioning is good and fully adjustable. Electrical outlets will require an adaptor to accomodate North American plugs. Local telephones calls may be made from the room at a reasonable rate (S$0.10) and you may direct direct for international calls (IDD). The windows are large and may be opened if (hot and humid Singapore) fresh air is desired. Halls and elevators are clean and modern. There is a small on-site dining cafe on the main floor beside the lobby with limited hours for meals; it is not open during off meal hours though room service is available for extended hours. But, across the street is a Seven-Eleven and beside that, on the corner of Bras Basah Road and Bencoolen Street, is a Kopitian where you can obtain all of your meals cafeteria-style with prices to match; the Kopitian is a series of vendor stalls in an air conditioned, clean and modern food court, which also boasts a shaded outdoor patio where you may sample western, malaysian, chinese, and indian cuisine and while you eat enjoy the street activity through the full height windows lining the two sides facing the street. There are ice cream vendors and fresh fruit vendors as well. If your tastes are more upscale, the Rendez-vous next door to the Strand Hotel provides a first class buffet at a mid-market price. The Strand is an inexpensive S$16-20 fare to/from the airport (though rates increase after midnight), or S$7 shuttle bus fare per person. The nearest MTR station, Dhoby/Ghaut on the North South line (station NS24), is a short relaxing 5-10 minute walk. Dhoby/Ghant is your transit connection to the Night Safari. The SIA (Singapore International Airlines) Hop-On tourist bus stops opposite the Rendezvous hotel where Selegie Road meets Orchard Road, so you are within 100 metres of very convenient tourist transportation; the SIA Hop-On operates from 9am to 6 pm every half hour and costs S$3 per SIA passenger (SSH stop-over passengers no charge) or S$8 adult/S$5 child per day for all others (unlimited all day pass). The Hop-On bus is operated for SIA by S H Tours/asiatours (routing info. available on the web). Alternatively, the SBS Transit (Singapore Bus Service) operates double decker City Buzz buses (S$1 per trip or S$5 all day pass) with stops at Dhoby Ghaut or the Singapore Art Museum, both close to the hotel. Operating hours are 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. with scheduled frequency every 10-15 minutes. The CityBuzz routing info. is available on the SBSTransit website (together with all other SBSTransit route info.) Both buses provide excellent and inexpensive means for seeing the tourist sights of Singapore (though only SIA Hop-on will go as far afield as the Botanical Gardens.) A 20-30 minute walk up Waterloo Street (running parellel to Bencoolen) will take you along a pedestrian friendly historic street which eventually becomes a pedestrian mall where you may experience several temples, a modern department store, and Indian shopping. A much longer trek (45 minutes to an hour) will take you all the way to little India. Walking 30 minutes down Bras Basah Road will take you by the Singapore Art Museum (admission and group guide S$3 adults/$1.50 child/senior -free on Fridays, I think), with opportunities for a convenient walk through Chijmes and the grounds of the Raffles Hotel, superior shopping at Raffles City, and the large (but largely unimpressive) shopping at Suntec City. Walking from your hotel in the other direction will take you to the start of Orchard Road shopping (but it's a long road virtually impossible to cover on foot). All in all, I found the Strand to be ideally located for exploring Singapore.", "Date": "June 15, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Strand Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d338340-Reviews-Strand_Hotel-Singapore.html", "Price": "$60*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">25 Bencoolen Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">189619</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "338340", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/1d/8c/b3/from-the-door-family.jpg"}}
