When booking the hotel, my main concerns were location, parking, and breakfast included. The location is just off the KuDamm making it easy to walk to bus stops, shopping, restaurants, etc. The breakfast was typical of German hotels & Gasthaus. It included several types of juice, coffee and tea, a nice selection of rolls, yogurt, cheeses and meats, cereal and milk, etc. The staff kept busy refilling the buffet and clearing dirty dishes, but managed smiles and greetings when someone came in or left the breakfast room. The parking situation was the only negative that I could think of. The website that I booked the room with stated that parking was available for a discounted rate. Unfortunately, the parking was on the busy street and first-come-first-serve. All parking places were full no matter what time of day or night. We ended up parking in the nearby underground parking garage about a block away. We had two double rooms. My husband and I had a double bed (actually two twins pushed together), a small but clean bathroom, and a window overlooking the very quiet courtyard. My mother-in-law and our 5 year old daughter had a room down the hall with 2 twin beds overlooking the street. Other than a loud arguement between 2 gentlemen on the street near midnight, the street did not have much noise. When we arrived, the light in the bathroom of this room was not working. I brought it to the attention of the gentleman working the front desk as we left to start our sightseeing. By the time we returned later that evening, the light had been fixed. Although the staff didn't speak much English, they did make an attempt to communicate with us. They were very forgiving of my terrible German. Overall, our one night stay was pleasant and left us well rested for a full day of sightseeing before departing Berlin.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cWiieland hotel was terrible!!!\u201d", "Author": "Tanya_2008", "ReviewID": "UR14205255", "Content": "It was the most awful hotel in my life: nobody at the reception desk after 9pm, we get the room-key at the gas station on the next street, lift is very small, furniture is old, receptionist is impolite.
