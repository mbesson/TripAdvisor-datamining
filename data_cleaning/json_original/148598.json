We had called 3 months ahead to reserve a refrigerator. Upon check in they told us that they are first come first served and that we would be put on a list to receive one when available. We did receive it that day but had to wait a bit. What's the sense of reserving it ahead of time? Our room was not ready by check in time either. A minor inconvenience but after traveling with 3 kids we needed the downtime. The cabanas by the pool were a great feature...we loved using it. The daily aqua aerobics was fun for all of us...even the kids enjoyed it! They also had daily iguana feeding which the kids loved and jet skis to rent on the beach...($80 per half hour for 2 people $60/one person). Although the food was expensive, it was excellent food. The italian restaurant and Steak restaurant were amazing! The view of the rainforest was beautiful as well. The pool was not the cleanest pool, but there were a lot of people there during spring break. The beach was really nice, but don't expect the turquoise blue water of the caribbean. If you have a rental car (recommended), definitely go to La Familia Bakery 2. It's about a 5-10 minute drive and is absolutely delicious. The donuts are awesome, the sweet bread is delicious and the breakfast sandwiches were amazing. We fed 15 people breakfast for $40.

The weather was great; one little sprinkle over five days. The hotel was very nice and the food for the most part was very good. Our favorite thing to drink were the great mojitos at the ocean/pool bar. They were a bit pricey at $10.50 each. The best restaurant is the one on the golf course. Terrific South American steak with wonderful fluffy popovers with chimichurri sauce. Great service. Flan was a bit heavy for my taste. The rainforest is a great tour to go on; we highly recommend it. We had a great tour guide! One suggestion I had for the hotel is adding some more night life. The pool bar closes too early and the beautiful indoor bar has great tvs but I would have love some dancing opportunities including Zumba exercide classes.

After a bad experience in the past at an all-inclusive this stay was very nice. I felt like the restaurants try harder to please the patrons since your paying for your meal. The Italian restaurant is excellent and we should have gone there twice. The steak restaurant was very good but a step down from excellent, Asian was very good. We didn't eat in the buffet restaurant but from what we heard it was very good. The outside pool restaurant was very good too and the pool service and bar were very good. Yes they are are on the pricey side and if I had more then one or two children I'd be more negative. The property is very nice and clean. With two pools, one for adults and one for kids made it comfortable for both. We had perfect weather which makes the experience nice of course. The golf courses are very nice but bring extra balls if your not a 9 handicap or less. Out of bounds is unforgiving, ie; steep dropoffs into water harzards and the dry fallen leaves make it hard to find your wayward balls. The casino was good. The only negative point I had was the coffee shop counter. Too expensive and the lines in the morning are uncalled for. 3 dollars for a can of Coke is outragous. If yoru a cheap guy like me bring your own liquor to supplement your daytime drinks and splurge occasionally for drinks at dinner. Yes they have convienent ice machines on the floors and the elevators move you quickly. Air conditioning was very good and they had comfortable beds. They could have had more hot water for our showers but it wasn't freezing. You have to request a refrigerator, Free Wifi only in the lobby currently but they said they are working on signals in the rooms.

The rooms were clean and kept clean. The grounds were beautiful and it was just a wonderful experience. We flew into San Juan and rented a jeep for the week. We brought along our GPS and it safely got us all over the place. We also took advantage of the valet parking. At $5 more fo parking, it was worth it. The people at the desk were very helpful with booking tours and activities. Do NOT use DragonFly tours for anything. Way over priced and very poor service. We tried them once and they SOOOO screwed up our tour. So much so that we cancelled it an did everything ourselves. On our 3rd day, we took the ferry to the island of Culebra. The ferry sucked but we had a great time on the island. We rented a golf cart and tooled all over the place and went to spent the day at Flemenco Beach. AWESOME BEACH!! We enjoyed Culebra so much that we went again on the 5th day. However, this time, we flew on Flemenco Air. The ferry took 1:45 minutes with lots of seasick people, the puddle jumper took 15 minutes. This time, we rented a jeep for the day ($50) and went snorkling at some beaches that only the jeep could get you to. The next day, we took a catamaran tour back to Culebra for more snorkling. The tour was with a great group called East Wind. I would highly recommend at least one trip to Culebra. Flemenco Beach is one of the best beaches in the world. GO!!!! We also did a bio bay tour at night. Great sight to see. Don't take the kayak tour, lots of work and can be scarey for kids. Take the trip with the electric boat. much more enjoyable and informative. If you set up your own trips and tours you will save lots of money and will pay for your jeep rental. Every activity is no more than a 30 minute drive. I would also recommend eating out as much as possible. Great food available. At the stoplight of route 3 and the road to the hotel is a great little hole in the wall called Mi Puerto. Cheap and super good. Also, the Kiosks are less than 15 minutes away. They have every kind of food you would want. In closing, Great trip, wonderful hotel, wonderful staff, the people are very friendly to people who don't have an attitude. We will be back.

Decided to stay here for our spring vacation this year after a wonderful experience at this resort three years ago. What a difference 3 years made! The resort facilities have deteriorated dramatically. It seems that the corporate owners are simply sucking money out and not properly upkeeping the facilities nor poperly training staff. We rented a car after landing in San Juan airport and drove to the resort. We waited in line at the front desk for 45 minutes to check in. Our bell boy gave up waiting and left our luggage unattended in the hall. We had to find another bell boy (after we finnally were checked in) to get our luggage up to our room. I knew somehting was wrong with the room as soon as the door opened. It smelled like sweatty feet! I figured that this may be due to being an ocean front room so we paid the bell boy and immediately opened the sliders to air out the room. The beds appeared made but the room looked dirty. The walls were filthy with dirt smudged on them, the shades on the lamps were encrusted with filth, the desk had white smudges of goo on them, the floors looked like they had not been washed for days. Uneasy with all this, I decided to undo the beds and check the sheets. Good thing I did....they had NOT been changed since there was sand and dirt on them! The beds were simply made over using the dirty sheets from the pervious guests! GIVE ME A BREAK! How discusting! I immediately called down to the front desk and they finnally gave us another room on a lower floor which I demanded to pre-inspect before accepting. While the second room was a little better in cleanliness, the overall poor conditions still existed like dirty walls and floors, filthy lamp shades and chipped bathtub which did not drain properly! I also noted that the cleaning staff did NOT change our sheets at all for the length of our stay! We always left a tip so that was not the reason. Even other lower priced hotels at least give you the option to either not have the sheets change or changed daily. NOTE TO WYNDHAM: CUTTING BACK ON CLEANLINESS IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO SAVE MONEY!!! The only good thing about this resort is the the pool area and easy access to the great surf beach. The pool area was clean and the landscaping in this area is nice. I did get a dirty towel from the \"clean\" towel cabana one day but again, I was not supprised since the help seems so blase regarding the cleanliness issue. Some of the chairs need to be trashed since the webbing is broken and getting poked by it is not fun. The resorts' pool activity staff were quite nice and held a few games of pool bingo and a fun session of water aerobics. However, there were no pool side waiters to be found. In order to get a drink, people had to go to the over-crouded tiki bar where the busy bartenders were mixing drinks non stop. How could they be friendly under those conditions? We had breakfast at the Marbella restaurant where the breakfast buffet was very good however quite pricy ($120 for 4 of us). We also ate at the Shimas restaurant where the food and service were very good. Glad we were finally able to get decent service somewhere on this resort! I was glad to have the rental car (resort charges 20/day to keep the car there) since we left the resort many times to visit Old San Juan and hike El Yunca rain forest both of which I highly recommend to do. On the days we left the resort, we ate breakfast at La Familia 2 bakery just off rt. 3 (awesome breakfast sandwiches)! Old San juan has great restaurants one should not miss. Just remember to park in the parking garage which is centrally located in old san Juan then walk to your destination, quite inexpensive and safe. If you chose to park on the street...make sure to tip the street bandits who will approach you or suffer the consequences of car damage. As for the Rio Mar Beach resort, I do not think I will ever bo back there nor could I ever recommend any of my family and friends to go there. So sad since it could be and used to be quite nice....Definitely needs a major interior and exterior facility rehab including re-educating management and staff on cleaning and customer service procedures!!!!!!!!", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wheeling, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSun, Fun & Golf\u201d", "Author": "rcmobergann", "ReviewID": "UR128234126", "Content": "I recently returned from a 6 night stay at the Wyhdham Rio Mar resort along with 11 others. I booked a golf trip for a group of friends from Florida who like to travel & golf along the way. The front desk manager, Senior Joel Rojas could not have been nicer in helping me put together this group & be sure everything went smoothly. Two couples booked suites & most had ocean view rooms. The resort is older, but don't take that to mean not worthy of a visit. The furniture in the rooms could be updated, but the beds were to die for! So clean, white & comfortable. The group slept well the entire time. I think since the building is older, it's built to last! My room was on the 6th floor with great views of the pools & ocean. We looked down to the pool volley ball which was quite active in the evenings (lots of laughing & enjoying an evening game). All we had to do is close the sliding door, & you did not hear a thing from the pool! Housekeeping is a little lagging. The rooms are clean enough, but on arrival we had no towels, once no coffee cups & no herbal tea was replaced, another time not enough towels. But one call & these itmes were taken care of. So just check ahead of retiring, to be sure you have what you will need for your comfort. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Check daily at the pool towel hut for a list of daily activities such as bingo, pool aerobics, aguana feeding. A lovely beach awaits you with staff to bring you chairs, dig a hole & place your large umbrella, & be sure you have what you need to spend the day.

It was so good we went twice!!! Plus with appetizers, desserts, kids meals, drinks, etc, we were still under $100 which you will find is a nice welcome. Another place we discovered was a local bakery called La Famiglia. They had the best pastries and fresh breads. We all got donuts and drinks for under $10! We were not as impressed with the kiosks that many had raved about. I found them to appear a bit shady and dirty. Like I said I am a vegetarian which also does limit my options a bit, but even my meat eating husband was not impressed with the kiosks. Overall we loved our time at the resort. I would recommend it to anyone. They were awesome with kids, but even if you don't have kids, the adult pool seemed very relaxing...I would look at it from afar! lol Oh also we noticed that never once did we observe anyone drunk or out of control.

We spent a lot of time on our balcony with drinks, just talking and relaxing. The rooms aren't overly luxurious, but were clean and very comfortable. We slept great every night we were there and had no problems with the room. The food was excellent, albeit expensive. We were prepared to spend a good portion of our money on food and drinks. But, it was all REALLY good. The drinks were strong and the restaurants were wonderful. We especially liked the Italian restaurant (went there twice!), and we were really excited to see that the Asian restaurant had a half-price sushi and saki special while we were there. The outside restaurants were fun and laid-back; I just wish that they would stay open a little bit later. We rented a car for a couple of days to go into old San Juan, El Yunque, and some other excursions. Make sure you rent a car for at least a day or two - you can do this at the resort. While you're out, be sure to stop at a grocery store to get some stuff for making drinks. We liked Ralph's on Hwy 3 (in PR, you can buy beer, wine, and liquor in grocery stores). This saved us TONS of money and made it easy to drink on the balcony. The casino was pretty small, but we had fun in there. My husband was disappointed that there weren't any poker tables (at least not while we were in there), but the slots were fun and we won on the roulette several times! (Free drinks at the casino was nice too!) The only bad part of the trip is that I was getting sick as we landed in PR. By our second day, I needed a doctor. The hotel was fantastic with helping us with this - they called a doctor in town to make me an appointment and helped us arrange a taxi to get there and back.

He was in our room fixing something almost every night whether it was the safe, key cards that frequently demagnetize, broken lights, etc. He was prompt to fix things, but we shouldn't have had to call him at all. The number of towels in the room constantly varied. It's like they took the dirty ones and never replaced them with clean ones. The sheets weren't changed during our entire stay even thought we requested a change. Service at the Tiki Bar was awful, as well. Expect to wait half an hour just to order food and even longer to get your food. Having your own car is a must if you do stay here. I'm so glad we did because this allowed us to book our own day trips- which saved us more than half of what the hotel was charging for the same trip. The property is huge and there is nowhere to walk to form there. Otherwise, you're stuck eating overpriced, bland food during your stay. There is no mimi fridge in the room.

Our room was on the first floor facing the main courtyard area. Even though it was dark out there was no way we were going to see ocean without standing on the patio chairs. After speaking to the front desk we were upgraded to a 5th floor ocean front room, which was more to our liking. The room was decent, not 5 star by any means, and after a couple day it did become very musty and damp, not sure if that was the humidity alone or the hotel, but after a couple days everything in our room felt cold (from the a/c) and damp. Our problems with the housekeeping started on our second day. We went to the gym and returned, the room had not been made up. We went to the pool for several hours and returned and our room had not been made up. We called the front desk and requested our room be cleaned and them left for massages. When we returned our room had not been made up. We called again and left to hang out in the lobby (the first of many hours spent waiting there) for our room to be cleaned. We even checked with the front desk after 45 minutes and they said housekeeping was headed there. We waited another 45 minutes and returned to find the room had not been cleaned. We called for a third time and asked that they come after 8pm since we were preparing to head out for dinner. At 7:20pm housekeeping knocks at the door and I have to send them away. I called and let them know for the fifth time that we asked for them to come after 8 and that I was forced to send them away because they didn't listen. When we returned from dinner at about 10:30pm, the room still had yet to be cleaned. We called and waited another hour in the lobby before it was finally done. The next day we left at 9am to go to the gym and put the do not disturb sign out since there was no need to clean a clean room. We returned to the room to find the sign gone and the room made up. We called, asked for a new privacy sign and requested the room be made up and then we left for the day. When we returned about 9pm that evening, there was a new sign on the door, but the room had not been cleaned. I assume you're starting to see a pattern here. We returned to the lobby, requested our room be cleaned at the front desk and waited another hour for the room to finally be cleaned. The next day we ordered room service, and to make a long story short they screwed up the order and we had to have the come back twice to fix it. Both time earned us a rude response from the lady answering the phone and a lecture from the delivery man that we should not have started eating our omelet to learn it was made incorrectly, but we should have cut into it first to check that it was correct before consuming.. I wasnt aware of this rule apparently. We finally spoke face to face with a housekeeping manager who apologized for our troubles and gave us a $100 credit. Having spent a good amount of time planning our relaxation around housekeeping I leave it to you the reader to decide if this is adequate compensation. As an aside all the food and drinks are overpriced and not that good. Our dinner at their pricey steakhouse resulted in a steak being sent back after my wife found a hair in her food.

Night time activities involved sitting around a fire pit in darkness as the tiki hut were closed by 8pm! no music outside, no weekend beach party to enjoy, the sovenier glass we bought became useless unless you planned on sleeping after 8pm! There was apparant drug use and drug selling on property! Strike three! Our third day involved a hotel staff member being murdered which was kept on the down low! after knowing all of this was going on ,any normal person would have left the resort and asked for a immediate refund! right! Well when your their with 40-50 family members for a reunion you just try to suck it up and try to enjoy your stay as best as you can. which we did. The Saturday of our stay there was supposed to be a beach party blowout. Well after getting ready and walking out to beach there was NO beach party ,tiki hut was closed again ! We took flyer to front desk and he informed us a member of band had passed away, party was cancelled and there were no other alternatives other then driving to San Juan. Bummer! All in all the resort is beautiful but its the little things made this resort sub par. example the basket ball court had one bent rim and the other had no net! come on! How much does it cost to get a new net? The basketballs themselves were beat up an were terrible to play with, the parking garage spaces were so tight that if you rented a car you were always worried it might get dinged up! they charge you to use the cabanas outside even if you have 40+ family members staying at resort. You cant bring your own drinks poolside, rather you have to lug around a cooler from beach to room everytime you wanted have a few! Plus there were no ice machines outside to refill your drinks. Rooms werent cleaned in a timely manner. I mean after 3pm you would think room service would be done considering we left room around 10:00am , We ended up waiting half an hour soaking wet in hotel lobby. The management never returned our messages until the day after we checked out. I mean we had family fly from all over the united states to attend a reunion and not once did management try to accomodate us in any way, no private room, no special celebration, no nothing! I mean we spent alot of money to stay there ,the least they could have done was set up a celebration room. The casino was understaffed as we had over 7 people wanting to play roulette only to be told that they do not have enough dealers! The best part of resort was checking out!

The Hotel blows. When we left the airport which cost $67.50 for a taxi to the hotel. We checked in at the front desk to a not so friendly and accomodating clerk. We wondered and asked for a ocean room in which she replied \" there are none\". So we entered our room located on the ground floor, overlooking the busses parked on the side of the hotel, the balcony was small and never mind being to small for 2 chairs and a table, it was too small for 2 people as well. I was going to throw the table off the balcony to make room. We walked in our room and then right out and asked a different friendlier and more accomodating clerk if we could change our room for an ocean view room which ended up costing $75.00 more per night. Opening our bureau draws to store our clothes , the draws smelt musty and we left our clothes in our luggage instead. The shower ran hot then cold , hot then cold. We left the \"do not clean our room\" tag on the outside of our room the whole stay. Did not want the maid in the room. We cleaned and took care of the room ourselves, asked for clean towels and toilet paper, emptied our own trash which was fine by me. With no uniformed security presence to identify with we deadbolted the door while we we're in our rooms. The police had to be called to the hotel for a domestic disturbance at the pool around 4 pm one day. To me, the first thing that I noticed is that the hotel let's the locals come to the hotel and use the pool everyday. That's why when you ask for a towel for the pool they ask you for your room number , and wrap a color band around your wrist so they can identify you as a guest and not a local because apparently it is an issue down there, they welcome the locals or they can't keep them out... Horrible...The food sucks and is way overpriced, every thing is rum, they push for you to drink rum. There is no night life. Breakfast between the 2 of us, 2 eggs, bacon, juice and coffee with tip $50.00..No thanks. After the first day we learned our lesson and decided to come home with some money and spent less and less each day. I don't mind spending at all as long as I get what I pay for..Not here, everything is doubled...I'm not stupid. The pool was nice if you don't mind sitting out in the rain every other day...The rain forest?.....Your in it.... Didn't go on any of the overpriced excursions...no thanks. The beach was nice if you like the scenery of a washed up car seat and a couple of automobile tires on the sand that no one would take the initiative to remove. I could go on and on. As we we're leaving on our last day Time Warner Cable had reserved for 600 of their employees to stay at the Wyndham Rio Mar. They we're coming in by the busses taking over the hotel. Before you book a vaction anywhere for that matter you should call ahead and ask if the hotel has a convention center and if they expect any corporate functions ..or your screwed. As we we're finally leaving the hotel waiting for a taxi to take us out of there and back to the airport ( which never showed by the way, had to take the shuttle instead) A woman we became friendly with by the pool throughout our stay ran into us and said her medication was stolen from her locked room, a controlled substance as well and had to file a report with the hotel. Glad to be back home again, won't ever go back. Food for thought,my wife had her $350.00 camera stolen from her luggage at the San Juan airport upon arrival, nothing to do with the hotel. but someone who worked at the airport rummaged through her luggage.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable hotel but food could use overhauling in quality & price.\u201d", "Author": "RidleyNY", "ReviewID": "UR126731519", "Content": "We booked this hotel because friends of ours were going.

We're a couple in our mid-60's so have a fair amount of travel experience and are a little picky. The Rio Mar is a large resort which is nicely maintained and is in a wonderful location with a very nice beach. We have never been anywhere where the staff is so consistently friendly and well trained. We paid a little more for an ocean view room and were glad we did...although the rooms on the \"back\" side are probably okay. We rented a car at the airport (30-40 minute fairly easy drive) and are glad we did as we like to explore and find \"local\" places. The resort is somewhat isolated so without a car restaurant choices would be limited to the resort choices. We bought wonderful pastries each night from the little walk up cafe by the casino entrance and had those for breakfast. When we were at the resort at lunch time we got inexpensive wraps and pizza from the same cafe. We explored at night for dinner and found 2 great spots: About 2-3 miles east of the resort along the highway that connects San Juan to the eastern end of the island we found a new take on \"food court\"- there is a string of connected small restaurants on the north side of the highway adjacent to the shore.....seemed to be mostly locals as opposed to tourists...what fun...we especially enjoyed \"The Ceviche Hut..Authentic Peruvian Cuisine\" and greatly recommend it. We also loved The Cafe Berlin in Old San Juan...we're vegetarian and the Berlin has really good veggie choices. One of the nicest parts of the Rio Mar is the beach. Attendants drag chairs/lounges and a beach umbrella to your chosen spot (no fee...give them a tip, though). A short walk to the east on the beach takes you to the river (it flows through the neaby El Yunque Rain Forest---another DON'T MISS) where you can wade and explore. To the west the beach seems to go forever...lots of low key condo resorts but very quiet and no crowds. If you love to run on the beach (I do) you can go a long way (far enough for my old legs). Also great for long walks. Nice waves...mostly gentle but big enough for fun. All in all, a GREAT resort in a great place.

After waiting in line, we were informed that our room was not yet ready and we would be called when it was. After one hour of waiting, we still were not called. We got back in the check in line and were told that we could go ahead and check in a \"nicer\" room that was ready right now. It was on the first floor. The view was to the common area where people walked to and from the beach/pools. (left me wondering what kind of view the other room had??) The ceilings were SO high. The floor was tile, but it seemed clean to me. Our shower did not drain either. Overall, I found the room to be clean, the balcony was nice. The beds were comfortable. It was relatively quiet in the room. There was nothing \"special\" about the room, extremely standard, but the bathroom was a bit nicer than the average hotel bathroom. The resort had several places to eat. The Tapas bar appeared to be open only on Saturday night. There was noone there on Sunday or Monday nights. Marbella seemed like a pretty good value to me as it was a buffet w/ dessert included. We also ate at Paulio and Seabreeze. I would say all the food was very good, but on the salty side. The menus were not very extensive. I found the prices to be comparable to other restaurants, I would not say it was outrageously priced at all. The drinks were high priced, and the spa treatments were also very high priced. (we didn't go to the spa). On Saturday night, the TIKI bar was open with a DJ and dance music. There was a crowd of people having fun, drinking, dancing, etc, but the bar and DJ closed shop at 10 pm!!! It was not open any other night. We were disappointed in the lack of things to do at night. The lobby bar was open and so was the casino, but that was it. No place to dance or watch live music, etc etc etc. I wish there had been more night life!! We did not have a car, so we stayed at the resort the whole time. The beach was nice, lounge chairs and umbrellas were complementary. The pool area was nice, but crowded. The resort had a few shops and kiosks to buy souveniers or snacks/HBA. There was a shuttle that is available to go from airport to resort and back. The cost for round trip was $75 per person. The trip took about 1 hour!! Also, we were wrongly charged for someone elses drinks at check out, but after the staff looked into the drinks in question, they realized the drinks were actually purchased by someone who had a similar room to ours. The front desk staff was friendly... but every time we went to the front desk it seemed to take longer than it should have, and involved quite a bit of them clicking and typing with their computers... Not sure what that was all about!! Also, there is an internet room, except you have to pay to use the computers. Overall, I found it well maintained, comfortable, and convenient.

So yes, the rooms were not up to the rest of the resort. But the view from the room was special with good sound proofing. Didn't hear our neighbors or folks by the pool. Food as expected was more costly than I would have liked. Frankly, overpriced. I did anticipate that as that seems to be the norm in these type of large resort destinations. There is a coffee, snack bar off the main floor that's a bit more reasonable. But down the hill and a few short miles down the main road is Luquillo Beach with rows of place to eat that offer great local fare and more reasonable prices. So worth getting into the car and making the 10 minute drive. My family and I enjoyed our time here.

Unfortunately the day before we arrived Hurricane Irene had hit PR. When we arrived we caught the van to the hotel, that I paid extra money for and reserved ahead of time, and the driver was very nice. There were a few other travelers along too. The weather was terrible and the roads were flooded but the ride was fine. When we got to the hotel it looked great. We did not have a rental car so we didn't have to worry about parking. We checked in smoothly. The room was nice but that first night the water and toilets were repeatedly affected by the power outage. I asked the concierge for water and they sent up two one-liter bottles of water. We had to use those for a few more days for teeth brushing due to the hurricane power outages. When I asked the front desk about the issues they informed me that the building was running off of generators. The hotel gave us a small discount on food the first night due to the issues. I won't say more about the food except that the theme night with the dancers was fun and worth it, but everything else was average quality and overpriced. Since my brother and I did not have any mode of transportation we had to use their restaurants and it cost us quite a bit more than we anticipated. Another issue is that because of Hurricane Irene the excursions company \"Dragonfly Adventures\" had to cancel many of their normal activities. Pros: they were very easy to deal with and very easily accessible (desk located in lobby, had staff member available 90% of the time). Every one was friendly. Cons: I had wanted to see a few key sites like the El Yunque rainforest and the bio-bay dinner trip and both were cancelled due to the storm. We did, however, get to go horseback riding and do the Old San Juan and Bacardi Factory tours, which were all very nice. The beach was a mess and pretty much not usable. The pools were average. We took advantage of the water aerobics class one day and that was fun. I won't even mention the hassle we had to go to leave PR due to Hurricane Irene.

The Good: The beach is nice, the grounds are fairly well kept but some areas are in need of repair. We enjoyed the pool area and the beach quite a bit. The beach staff are A+ and some of the nicest folks we met in the resort. The folks at the tennis shop are also nice and their facilities are well maintained. The Bad: They nickel and dime you on everything. $10 / day to get WIRED internet in the room. $15 a day to park , $16 breakfast for two eggs for breakfast, $3.50 for a banana or apple. The min-fridge that seems to have been in the room at one point was removed from it's enclosure in all the rooms in our group so you have to buy from them instead of getting your own ahead and saving $. It struck me as dishonest and greedy. The concierge staff lie to you with a smile on their face. They do there very best to push you toward their over priced excursions through \"dragonfly adventures\" their partner in the tour and shuttle service. We inquired as to renting a sail boat which we saw on the beach and the concierge said it was privately owned and not something we could use but instead he suggested a $150 per person boat trip from their service. The truth was that the sailboat can be rented but it's by another vendor who is on the beach and it's much cheaper. They are obviously more concerned about their bottom line than the customer experience. All excursions seemed over priced and under delivered. We went on two Dragonfly adventure tours and were disappointed with them both. The El Yunke rainforest tour was led by a short woman who could not walk very well and we found out later she took us on a very short trip instead of the one to the waterfall because she had mobility issues. There were also questions of her integrity as we later found out she told two different people she graduated form two different colleges. The Dragonfly tour to Old San Juan and Bacardi was horrible. There was so much traffic we didn't have enough time to do both so we ended up going to Old San Juan for an hour and a half. 3 hours of driving for a 1.5 hour run around the city on our own. The tour guide for this trip, who was another over weight individual, made no less than a half dozen references to getting dunk which were followed by tales of his own personal life instead of the surrounding area and information. AVOID DRAGONFLY ADVENTURES. The staff @ concierge and the hotel based restaurants were indifferent 80% of the time. For some reason there is an air of indifference with a slight hint of despise from some of the staff here. I do not know why smiles are greeted with scowls and it's very unprofessional and does not lend itself to an enjoyable area. CHECK YOUR BILL. As others had stated they tried to slip several charges on our bill which we had to dispute. They removed them but the fact that they would tack on a $15 a day parking charge for us when we didn't even have a car shows the level of dishonesty, incompetence, or both, at this resort. WET ROOMS! The rooms were damp and musky and the A/C was always blasting on low. This wasn't isolated as all of the other folks in our group said the same thing. one had to have a dehumidifier in their room since the first morning they woke up there was so much moisture their bed and floor were both soaked with water. Leaving a piece of paper out over night would result it it being soggy in the morning. I'm a bit afraid of what it may have done to my laptop over the 6 days we were here. FREEZING AIR CONDITIONING EVERYWHERE Bring a sweater and long pants for when you are indoors. We didn't expect to need to be warmed up in the Caribbean but every hotel room, meeting room, restaurant and area in the hotel is freezing cold. We believe it is to keep the air circulating so the mold and mildew doesn't set in. In any event shorts alone won't be enough for most. LAST THOUGHTS: The bottom line with this place is I would not return and I would not recommend it.

The driver gave us great information about the hotel and the culture. Check in was easy and because it was our anniversary we were given a complementary upgrade to an ocean front room. The room was clean and smelled great and we have nothing but good things to say about the room and the service. The pools were clean and well kept but I will advise future guests to get towels early and stake your spot as it fills up quickly both at the pool and on the beach. Yes the concierge asked if we were interested in some freebies for the Wyndham timeshare information and we declined and were not bothered again. We took a great tour of Old San Juan from Dragon Fly Tours at the concierge desk and Frankie our driver was one of the highlights of the trip, funny, informative and ready to answer any questions and stopped to give the tour a taste of authentic Puerto Rican food on a beautiful beach near Luiza. As my husband and I are from the cold north (not this year) we wanted to be outdoors as much as possible. My only small disappointment was that the Tiki Bar and other outdoor restaurant closed early between 5 and 6pm. The restaurants in the building were open. One was a buffet and the other 2 were a more formal dining experience than we were looking for. So to make up for this there is a small terrace outside the lobby bar that serves small plates, nachos and other happy hour foods. There is also the option to go to ERL outside the casino and order a pizza to go, stop by the lobby bar for a beverage and take it all outdoors to an ocean front table on the deck of the tiki bar. I have read about the cost of food and yes this is a resort and you have to expect it to be pricey, but a large pizza at ERL is $20.00, 2 beers are about $15.00 and the empty table oceanfront in the closed tiki bar is priceless.

The only think missing was live music but there was always piped music playing.Drink prices were high but they had a two for one special every day.

We ate in local restaurants as we wanted to eat Puerto Rican cuisine but the restaurants looked nice although somewhat pricey. All in all, we loved the resort and would highly recommend it. On a side note, if you have not been to Puerto Rico for many years, you should visit.

It operates as both hotel and time share. As a hotel, it is not terribly expensive. As a time share, it is way out of line in terms of number of points required vs what you get. The public areas are reasonably well-kept and seem to be refreshed recently. The units, however, require some monitoring. Our unit on the premium 6th floor level was actually fairly shabby. (Shabby seems to be the norm in PR, however.) The balcony chairs sported badly chipped paint, and the bathtub! Well! The porcelain was totally worn off in a dozen or more places--mostly where one had to stand--and the tub looked filthy. I think it was actually clean, but you know . . . I don't mind standing on my own dirt, but if there's a chance it's someone else's, that's not acceptable. Replacing a bathtub is not a big deal. It is not even costly. It only means the room would be out of commission for a day. As with many resorts in desirable locations, the Rio Mar charged extra for just about everything. The price for food seemed extremely expensive, but frankly, the nearby restaurants were nearly as costly, even the kiosks. Drinks were expensive unless you got the day's special. The breakfast buffet was $24/person for a fairly basic buffet. (I guess I'm used to Las Vegas.) The staff, however, was extremely helpful and accommodating. They tried to \"make it right\" when we complained about the tub by giving us a free tour of Old San Juan which would have cost us $60 each. (The tour was really good, by the way. Try to get Frankie!) We learned to eat at the lobby bar instead of the buffet or the premium restaurants. Or to go down the hill to Antonjito's (a reliable B quality restaurant--but not all that cheap) or head over to the kiosks (La Parilla is very good but pretty pricey). Stay away from the restaurants recommended by the concierge, though. The Hacienda Caribali was HORRIBLE! I didn't find the concierges very helpful. Parking is $15/day for self parking if you can find a spot in the garage. Valet is $20. You really do need a car unless you plan never to leave the resort--not a good idea IMHO. If you want to go to Vieques, take the ferry from Fajardo. It's cheap--$1 each way for seniors, a bit more for you youngsters. Your parking will cost $5 for the day.

Overall, we were very pleased with our stay. Go prepared for a few things, however. Transportation: Unless your money is unlimited and/or you love the convenience of staying at this beautiful property the entire time, rent a car! (Word of advice: stay clear of EZ/Allied Car Rental. They put a $500 hold on your credit card--even after you purchase the $9.95/day fee for liability insurance. I think we were conned.) With a car you have the freedom to leave the resort atmosphere and experience some of the \"real\" Puerto Rico. The ride from the airport in San Juan was interesting. Drivers are very assertive, for lack of a better word. Definitely be ready for defensive driving--always scanning! Also, it is not a \"beautiful\" ride. San Juan is in rough shape in some parts. Sad, really. Traffic in the late afternoon to the resort was surprisingly light. We made it in about 45 minutes and it was about 4:30 in the afternoon. HOWEVER, morning rush hour traffic from Rio Grande into San Juan (the airport) was ridiculously heavy and we missed our morning flight. Give yourself at least 2 hours to get back to the airport if it's during morning rush hour--especially if you have a rental car return. Also, TSA at the San Juan airport is VERY slow. It was pretty frustrating standing there looking at two agents with only one of them checking IDs and the other just taking up space. We missed our flight by 5 minutes due to traffic and lack of efficiency through security. Parking at the resort is not free!! It's $15.00/day and $20 for valet. The parking is underground and crowded in the evening. We sometimes got the last spot! The elevator from the parking garage only worked sporadically. It was quite a chore trying to figure out where the stairs are and finding your way back to the lobby. Food: We were tired from our first day of travel so we decided to splurge and eat at one of the resort restaurants. We were disappointed that the Tiki Hut (outdoor) had closed at 6:00. The beach and outdoors were so inviting, that it was disappointing that we couldn't eat close to the ocean that first night. To me, that was far too early to close. Anyway, we ended up eating at Marbella. It was a very pleasant restaurant with excellent, attentive staff. Only disappointment was that there was no regular menu--only an Italian buffet--that evening. The food was really good, but we were expecting to have choices. It was about $100 for the four of us to have dinner with only water to drink. We weren't surprised at the price from other reviews. The Asian restaurant was open as well; however Palio was closed at that time. In fact, I never saw Palio was open during the time we spent there. Maybe we just missed it. That was the only time we ate at the resort. If you have a car, definitely take the time to drive the <10 minute ride to the kiosks in Luquillo. It is not a resort atmosphere, so expect that. It seems to be a hang out for a lot of the locals as well. We really enjoyed being there. Watch out for broken glass, however! Seems to be some partying going on there later on in the night. We enjoyed a fabulous lunch at La Parilla and dinner at El Jefe Burger. Both meals were good with a fun atmosphere. Check out all the kiosks. Lots of deep fried food, drinks of all sorts and friendly faces. There are a couple of mediocre gift shops there as well. We had no idea what to expect at these kiosks, but we're sure glad we went. Not all the kiosks are open during daylight hours, however. PS--coco frio is NOT cold pieces of coconut!! It's cold coconut water served in the coconut itself. Interesting! Also, mofongo (a local dish) isn't the greatest--but you should try it anyway! We also had breakfast one day at Antojitos at the bottom of the road leading to the resort. I would not recommend it for breakfast. The omelets were watery and luke warm. Maybe lunch and dinner would have been different. Cute place, though. El Yunque: We took 1/2 day to explore the rainforest. We had mixed feelings. We all thought it was beautiful. We did a challenging hike to Mina Falls. Getting to the falls was easy, going back was all uphill. So plan your hikes accordingly. I probably wouldn't bother stopping at the visitor center. Just get a map from the concierge at the hotel (he has recommendations) and keep on driving up the mountain road. It's twisty/turny so drive with care. There are snack places with bathrooms in several places up to the trail head to Mina Falls. There appears to be two separate trail heads for this particular hike to the falls. We bypassed the first one as there was no parking and drove onto the next one. Would we do the rainforest again? Probably not. It's just not our thing. But we're happy to have visited at least once. If you're a naturalist, however, plan on spending the day hiking, etc. This is the place for you! Not many people even realize that our US National Park system has a rainforest! FINALLY! The property: BEAUTIFUL!!! We're from Minnesota, so just the idea of being near the ocean was exciting. This property has amazing grounds which seem to be very well-kept. Our ocean front room was just that--just expect that your view of the ocean may be hindered by palm trees. We couldn't complain. You are just a short walk from the ocean through the grounds, and you hear the waves constantly. It was very windy there during our stay. I think that might be quite common. Our room itself was fine. We're not big complainers, however. Other people may have been bothered by dust in the corners, sand in the tub, etc. It wasn't a big deal to us. Our only complaint about housekeeping was that we didn't get enough towels when we finally did leave them on the floor for fresh ones. Even that wasn't a huge deal. The pools were lovely with plenty of seating, and that was later in the afternoon when we wanted to get out of the ocean wind. There is music playing most of the time, so sit away from the speakers if that's not your thing. Nice perk is that the resort provides beach towels and chairs and umbrellas for the beach. Tip the guy who puts the umbrella in for you!!! I wish I could remember the first guy's name that helped us (Miguel??), but he was so informative about the beach and swimming in the ocean. Very sweet guy. We were very happy with the size of the beach. It was very easy to find a spot all your own and right on the water. Check in was very smooth for us. Staff was friendly and quick. Use your phone to check out when you leave. It's quick and easy and will save you a stop at the front desk which can sometimes be busy. The walls of the rooms seemed somewhat thin. When our neighbor slammed the door (which happens when you leave your balcony door open) our bed shook. We heard people talking quite a bit in the hallways and somewhat next door, but that could just be rude people! One thing we should mention is that once you get on the grounds of the resort it's slow going. There are speed bumps slowing you down constantly. I get that, but it got a little annoying at times. The drive to the resort itself is long and windy. Just enjoy the scenery of this beautiful place. Overall, we were very pleased with the resort itself.

Mostl days, we got coffee at the little cafe by the casino. We made a run to Walgreens and picked up snacks and cereal, juice, milk, etc. We live in a resort area and expect restaurant prices to be higher, however, we ate breakfast one day at Marbella which set us back $80 bucks...should have ordered off the menu...we weren't impressed with our value on this one. We ate lunch at SeaBreeze by the pool one day and had a terrific pork quesadilla...price in line with what we expected ($60). Also ate at the Tiki Bar one day during lunch; price also in line here in our view. For dinners, we went off site. Don't be afraid, try the kiosks in Luquillo! We ate at El Jefe Burger, Tapas 13, La Parilla, and Ay Bonito and were never disappointed. Each night we spent about $100 and enjoyed every meal. We rented a car for about $150 for the week and took day trips to El Yunque, Seven Seas Beach, Luquillo Beach, and Old San Juan.

I was a bit unsure if we'd have a good stay after reading some of these reviews. But we had a great time. While I understand some (but only some) of the criticism, the pros outweigh the cons. Pros - If you're looking for a secluded retreat away from the city, this is perfect. It's about 35-45 minutes from San Juan airport, depending on traffic. The property itself is secluded. When you first turn into the property, there is a security gate. The person there has a record of your reservation. Once you get through, you drive a winding, pretty road for less than 5 minutes (passing the golf courses, country club, tennis courts, and time share villas) to the entrance to the resort. We arrived about 4pm on a Wednesday. The valets were immediately at our car to help with luggage and get us to the front desk for check-in. The parking was a bit confusing at first (you have a choice of valet vs. self-parking), but it worked out once we understood what our options were. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful, with a gorgeous view right away of the ocean. There is ample seating all throughout. The front desk clerk was very welcoming. In fact, this was a common trait of every employee we encountered at Wyndham. We were always greeted warmly, whether it was while walking through the lobby, at the pool, or in the elevator. We had booked a mountain-view suite, but they gave us an ocean-view suite when we arrived since the mountain-view suite was not yet ready for us. That was fine by us! And they kept the same price. We spent our trip mainly playing tennis (there is a shuttle that will take you there - but we just drove ourselves every morning) and relaxing by the pool. We stayed in the adult pool area. There is a family and activity pool as well, but that tended to be much louder. The adult pool was quiet and relaxing. You have the option of renting a cabana, which I highly recommend. Yes, it's pricey, but totally worth it if you can swing it. Keeps you out of the sun and rain (and it rained at least twice every day we were there). And you won't have to worry about getting a spot at the pool. We ate dinner at the resort every night except one (when we went to Condado). The food and wine at the restaurants are surprisingly good. And the waitstaff is very helpful. For instance, we had ordered a particular bottle of wine, but was then told they did not have any. bottles left So they brought us a similar bottle from the menu, which was more expensive, but charged us the less expensive price. The grounds are beautiful and well-maintained. The beach doesn't stretch on for miles and miles, but is definitely sufficient. Cons - The restaurants are probably more expensive than they should be, but the food is better than expected. And if you're from a big city, the prices are completely in line with most restaurants. Another con is that the adult pool never seemed to have enough room for everyone. We didn't have a problem because we rented the cabanas. But there were people every day after 11am looking for lounge chairs. The rooms and furnishings could definitely be updated, but considering we didn't spend much time inside, they were fine for what they were. The same for the tennis center - the courts need some repair. All in all, a perfectly nice resort with friendly and attentive service.

Both room and bathroom were very spacious, bed was really comfortable - we enjoyed sleeping in! The water pressure in the shower was excellent, but the tub was a standard sized shower/bath combo. This was disappointing. For a suite, we expected a larger Jacuzzi-type tub. Three \"minor\" complaints were the extremely overpriced food, the lousy \"business center\" and the daily parking fees. Food at resorts is always more expensive, but this was outrageous - lots of added taxes and fees at all the restaurants in the resort - watch out. There are several restaurants in Rio Grande that are affordable and tasty. Check out Antojitos Puertorriquenos down the hill from the resort - the food/service is excellent and the prices are minimal compared to the resort restaurant prices. Quickly, in case you need to take care of any business while at the resort, printing in the tiny business center is $1 per page and faxing is the same - $1 per page. No Kinkos-FedEx in town either. The parking is $15/day. Adds up so be prepared. Overall - we'd go back.

We went with another couple and met 3 friends there for 5 nights. As expected, the hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and it was exactly what we expected. We didn't spring for the ocean view room which we regret as we were on the 1st floor on the side of the resort. Good clean room however so no real complaints. Ask about renting a mini fridge ($10 per day but they forgot to charge us) so you can run out to the grocery stores and pick up Medalla lights ($6 each on the resort) and food for breakfast and lunches. Only resort restaurants we ate at were the beachside grill (burgers, sandwiches, kind of expensive but you are eating on the beach what do you expect?). We didn't eat at any of the fancier restaurants for any of the meals because we know they are expensive and we prefer to explore the island and try new things. You can walk (about 2 miles) on the beach to the kiosks of Luquillo or catch a cheap cab and there are plenty of restaurants there to eat at that are great. La Parilla (best restaurant my wife and I have ever ate at), El Jefe Burgers, and others. Staff at the resort was cool. Casino was small but had blackjack, roulette, slots and other card games. Don't expect to much but its fun. Each day we just ate breakfast in the room with supplies from the grocery store, made lunches and packed beers/drinks and headed down to the beach. Plenty of chairs and tons of space so no issues. You can get an umbrella (they are free) but the staff will put it in for you so give them $5 and you will be fine. No problems from anyone with drinking/eating on the beach so that's the way to go. Even drank our own supplies at the pool and nobody cares. My wife and I are in our late 20s as was the rest of our group and there were other people our age. There were also families and older couples. There is enough space that nobody gets in each others way. There is a family pool, adults only pool, and all the beach. This was our 2nd time at the resort and if we found a good deal we would probably go again. My wife and I walked for miles in both directions on different days with no issues. Locals are friendly. We also did the El Yunque rain forest (we didn't do the tour, just hopped in the car our friends rented, grabbed a map, and walked the trails we wanted to). Also did the Bio Bay which was awesome. You kayak through the mangroves at night (our group had at least 15 other couples with glow sticks so you see where they are but can still see the glowing water and stars). Try this for sure.

Rental Car Tip: make sure to get the Tollway sticker for the rental car at the San Juan airport rental car center so you can avoid stopping at the cash toll lines on the highways. It will be a big time saver. I didn't do this and regretted it, especially when we got stuck waiting in a cash toll lane for one hour on the PR66 Carolina tollway.

Before, I had left I read a lot of reviews. I would say, many reviews were spot on about the food, service etc. I didn't set my expectations high. The person I traveled with had been there 2 years ago and assured me it was good. So, here is what I thought. Check-in: Check in went fairly smooth. Since I read a lot of reviews about views, I asked for a high floor. Jose, at front desk said,\" I will see what I can do, but we are running a full house this week\"..After typing in on the computer, He told us there was a room on 5 but it wasn't ready and we could wait like 30 minutes and he would call us on our cell. So, we explored around the lobby and outside. We got our call and picked up our key. Well, we ended up on the first floor. In the end, our room wasn't too bad. I actually liked that it was the first room in the hallway and it was right next to the spa, close to the door to go outside to the pool,and near all the restaurants. It was also by the stairs by the lobby so we could easily get drinks at the lobby bar and head to the cafe for a quick snack. We would get drinks and bring them to the room and sit on our balcony. I didn't hear a lot of noise by elevators, but I did hear the people coming in the doors a lot, late night and early morning, but nothing too bad. Food: It was very expensive. I went to Marbella's for the Mexican Buffet. It was 24.95, but you eat as you wanted. I would have liked more selection at the buffet. I was looking for tacos, burritos, but it was quesadillas, rice, beans, etc. It was ok, but wanted more variety. I also did Shimas the Japanese restaurant and that bill was 113.00 for 2 people. I got the coconut chicken, I hardly tasted coconut. It was not worth the price. The server was bad. He didn't come back to ask us how our food was or anything. I got a drink and it was 10.50 and not very good. I think it was called Red Lotus. I was their with a friend, we are just 2 female friends and Melvin our waiter called me her partner, my friend was like, what, you mean my friend. Just because we are 2 ladies, don't assume anything. We also ate at Palio's. It was the better of the 3 restaurants, again, very pricey. I had the tortellini and I got 7 of them and sauce for 21.00. I can buy a whole package for like 4-5 dollars. I also got a salad and that was another 11.00, and I got a glass of wine. Again, when all said and done, your looking at a bill close to 50 or more for 1 person, depending on how many drinks you get etc. There was no such thing as cheap meals here. The second night, I got Penne Forno, it was ok, and 24.00, plus salad and drinks. Service was good and I spoke Spanish to the waiter the entire time. It was fun! Cafe/ Bakery: I got a bagel and juice here. The bagel was not sliced and you put the cream cheese on yourself. I didn't realize this until I got to the room. The next day I got a chocolate muffin, it was good. Juce and a bagel/ muffin, 7.50. Marbella's- Breakfast Buffet: 24. 95.. the usually breakfast stuff. You can order a la carte, it is cheaper. I didn't eat 24. 95 worth of food the day I went. Tiki Bar: Slow, I had to go to the bar twice to let them know I existed and wanted to order. Chicken sandwich, fries, and a drink, about 35.00. I got the Babaloo, it was just ok. The mojito was good. There were no cheap meals here at this hotel, allow yourself a food budget and drinks. I hear there are cheap restaurants down the road in Luiquillo Beach, I suggest exploring that option, unless you don't care about high prices. Lobby Bar: Ask for drink specials, Barcardi drinks were 5.00. I had a lot of Barcardi Limon with Sprike, or one night, was daquiri specials for 5.00. I guess it depends on what you like to drink. Towels by the pool: I just wanted a towel, I don't need to be hit up for time shares each time. Pools: I used the adult pool, get there early for a chair especially on crowded weeks. This area can also be a little shady, as the sun moved behind the hotel. The cabanas take up space. Look for the iguanas, they like to come out in bask in the sun and might even walk under your chair. I really enjoyed the pool, big and roomy. There was a main family pool for kids with a water slide. They had basketball courts, volleyball courts, tennis,and an arcade, which I didn't personally use, but it was there. Beach: I found it to be typical and fairly clean. There were chairs for hotel guests. There is no lifeguard, but the flags were up. We had 2 days of red flags. The waves were high and rough, but we still went in and took some dips. Take a walk down the beach, it goes on for a while. It looks like people were cleaning the beach up from a storm that happened by in January or December. The beach was private and only hotel guest seemed to be using it. The water was typical Atlantic Ocean water, sandy which seaweed type of things floating, but least it was not rocky. It was warm and it was not home! Tours: We did the El Yunque tour and Old San Juan Historical. El Yunque was great. It was a lot of walking and you should be in good shape to do the trail, as it It can be very steep. I went to the tour desk and must of had that look on my face that I wanted info. The one girl who helped me first was nice and told me about the tours, she then offered me 2 free tickets to the tours, and then I realized she was trying to sell me a time share. Watch out for time share people, so then she directed me to the other tour person at the desk and I booked my 2 trips from Dragonfly. If you go on the Historical Tour, it does not to go EL Morro, just drives by it, you go to the other fort: San Cristobol. Tours left promptly from the hotel and returned you promptly. I did not have any problems with tours and if you talk to the right people first it is fine, least for me it was. Juan Lopez was our guide and he was great. Rooms: Typical, clean for the most part, title floor, flat screen TV, etc. I found the beds comfortable. I sort of had a pillowtop feel. The only problem, it took 2 days for them to put the blanket on the bed. We just had sheets. It was ok, since it is Puerto Rico and warm, but I was a little chilly. The room was not to bad, just a few little paint peels, but who stays in the room all day anyways? It was fine for the price. I had a nice view of the courtyard and the entrance doors. If I looked over the balcony I could see the ocean. We were not really facing the ocean. I was in room 1103. Location: The hotel is exactly 1 hour from Old San Juan, and about 45 minutes from the airport. We did our tours and stayed at the resort. We didn't want to do the rental car thing, but if you want to find cheaper places to eat, maybe a car would be good, or a taxi. The area near the hotel looked poor and dumpy, but you see that on many islands. You do see El Yunque from the hotel, which is also nice. The rainforest is about 3 miles from the resort, but at least 20-30 minutes driving. It is overcast a lot because of the rainforest, but we see had plenty of sun! Nightlife, well, there is a casino.. but it is small. We usually just went swimming at night and used the hot tub. We basically had the pool all to ourselves. We also just walked on the path. It was nice. They should have more activities at night, perhaps, a dance club, or some shows. Overall, I had a great relaxing vacation. I saw a lot of great things, El Yunque and Old San Juan. I had been to Old San Juan before from cruising, but it was nice to be able to go back and visit things I did not have time for on the cruise. The hotel is not that bad. I would go back, but I would try to eat other places off the resort. It is not a 5 star hotel, but it worked for me for my budget. Sure, it could use some upgrades, but it is not the worst place I stayed at. Beware of timeshares, unless you want that. Service can be slow, but their was a lot of people, since it was school break time. I do think the food was over priced, but I sucked it up and ate there, next time maybe not. Drinks were pricey, but didn't seem watered down. It is far away from San Juan, renting a car may be an option.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort, I can't wait to go back.\u201d", "Author": "TJCBuffalo_NY", "ReviewID": "UR125232937", "Content": "Our Family just returned from 8 Great days at the Rio Mar Beach resort.

Drunk people turning in late at night have a universal volume, that being set to \"obnoxious.\" Luckily, it got quiet quick. There was a separate pool & hot tub for adults (YAY!) but we were able to invade the kid's territory and use the water slide. Plenty of family-friendly activities ~ feeding iguanas, lawn games, water aerobics, dancing lessons. A (gas - no smoke! yay) fire pit at night and a \"drive-in\" movie projected poolside. There was an arcade, too, but I'm not sure it got much use, the pools and the beach were so wonderful! Fell in love with the sounds of the Coqui frog. We were able to purchase yards of adult beverages and got cheaper refills. We LOVED Palio. My sister has Celiac and the chef went over the entire menu with her, and there was very little she could NOT have. And what we did was AMAZING. We ate at Marbella one night, and local young people came in and danced in traditional costume. They put on a great, fun show! If you want a less expensive breakfast, there is a nice cafe outside the casino where you can get coffee, baked goods, cereal cups, yogurt, fruit... make a picnic breakfast for the beach! I also saw folks with kids walking around there with pizza boxes at snack/dinner times. Inexpensive way to appease finicky kids?? The waitstaff at the restaurants and the cafe were incredibly friendly and helpful. The bartenders at the poolside Tiki Bar were a little grumpy, but perhaps that was due to the screaming, foul-mouthed, drunk guest they had to deal with? We both had mahi mahi salad two days in a row! It was great! We took a Dragonfly excursion to the Bacardi Distillery & Old San Juan that was great! Having a designated driver ~ excellent idea!!! Another day we rented a car and climbed to the top of El Yunque, and the Mt Britton Tower, and hiked to La Mina Falls. One of the most enjoyable hikes I've ever done! Barely able to walk after, we drove to the kiosks in Lonquillo to see the local beach hangout. Don't miss Tapas 13. WONDERFUL. Wish I could have spent a day at that beach, too! Beautiful! The hotel grounds were beautiful. Well groomed and landscaped. We didn't pay for the cabanas. Next time? They have little radios with call buttons when you want service, but servers from the Tiki bar come to check in on folks around the pool anyway from time to time. There were 4 small tents to buy jewelry from local crafters. Not overwhelming, very nice. Also, there was an airbrush tattoo place that looked fun. Areas for improvement: When we arrived, our room was not ready. We weren't given tickets or even asked to identify our luggage. When rooms became available, our suitcases were sent to the room of the men with whom we happened to arrive, aboard the airport shuttle. That was fine. There are never valuables in my luggage. He noticed quickly and had the bell hops retrieve them. Also, they offered us really nice suite if we didn't want to wait for a regular room. It only had a sofa bed, though, and I'm \"too old for that.\" We were patient and got the room with the awesome beds and the gorgeous mountain view. Everyone was easy-going, and we were on vacation. It all worked out, and we were poolside enjoying the mahi mahi and mojitos, so it didn't FEEL like we were waiting. The tub drained well on the first day. After that, it didn't do so well but that was likely because we showered not realizing how much sand we had dragged in. I think I had a pound of sand in my hair from playing in the ocean waves. Our room was skipped by housekeeping one day, but because we're rather neat, that wasn't an issue ~ we called for and they quickly brought us more packets of coffee for our \"wake up\" cups.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronx, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this place\u201d", "Author": "TimA990", "ReviewID": "UR125201599", "Content": "The customer service is one of the worst I've experienced.

The hotel rooms are not the most up to date and the bathrooms do need some work. With that being said, why would you go to PR and spend all that time in your room? The room itself and the bathroom are clean enough and serve the purpose of sleep and showering. The amenities are better than average; the spa is really nice, the golf course is nice and the restaurants seem nice. I say they seem nice because we only ever ate at the Tiki Bar located between the beach and the pool. We rented a car to save on the $150 round trip shuttle to and from the airport. The car rental and self parking amounted to the same as the shuttle and we had much more freedom. If you come out of the resort and go straight, you're 5 minutes from the rainforest, which costs $80 a person if you take the tour from the resort. Come out of the resort and take a left, you're 5 minutes from Luquillo Beach and more than 60 restaurants, which were incredible (at least the 5 we ate at). The food at the resort seemed overpriced (after all, it is a resort, it's expected). For what our lunch cost one day at the Tiki bar, we got an appetizer, two meals and drinks for dinner at the Kiosks at Luquillo. They're called kiosks, but they are all sit-down, open air restaurants. There is a grocery store 10 minutes from the hotel on your way in from the airport. Stop there, grab some breakfast stuff and save yourself the $26 charge per person, per day for the breakfast buffet. Overall, you can't beat the location; close to the rainforest and restaurants. The beach is a 2 minute walk from your room and there are a few different pools to relax by.

When we arrived at 3:30pm on Friday, they could not check us in until 6pm. This happened to many people, so beware if you book here that you could be waiting around for your room. Also beware that it's very loud if you are placed near the elevators or entrances into the lobbies. The elevators make dinging noises not only when they stop at levels, but when people are going in and out of them, which is highly annoying throughout the night. With the \"casino\" there, people are up late into the evening/morning. The rooms themselves were \"ok\", nothing special. We were in a room next to the lobby the first night and asked to be moved the second night since we were not able to sleep due to the noise. There are 2 basic pools.. one for the kids/family, and an \"adult\" pool. You have to be up early to snag any of the chairs near the pools, especially the adult one. People will place their towel on chairs near the pool and never surface again for hours, thus blocking the chairs from others. If you have a family and little kids, the kids pool area seemed good. There's a slide, volleyball net, music, etc in that area. The adult pool side is nice, but the chair area is too small. Most people end up on the beach, which was ok. The water was the color of beaches on the East coast in the US. The kids around us were having a good time though. You are pretty much captive to eating on-site if you don't rent a car. The restaurants are not great, but the breakfast buffet was quite good ($24 per person). Drinks at the pool started around $10.50. Completely disappointed in Shimas, the Asian fusion restaurant on-site. We ended up grabbing some sandwiches at a small counter near the \"casino\" some of the time, which were around $10 each, just to give you an idea. If you are looking for a big casino, the Wyndham doesn't have it. It advertises a \"casino\", but there were only a few blackjack tables running and a few rows of slot machines. If you are going for gambling, this is not the place for you. It seemed like the majority of the patrons were there to play golf, so if that's what you want, then this would be a good resort for you. The tennis area was pretty run down. I'm not sure if it was due to the time when we were there, but most of the patrons were families. We were hoping for a honeymoon type setting, but instead had kids running around and families to contend with everywhere. It was not a place to just relax and not run into anyone. We had an absolutely horrible experience with Dragonfly Tours, which has a tourdesk at the Wyndham. Be sure to triple check your reservations because they were the most idiotic and inept tour company I have used in my life. You most likely will want to go on the bioluminescence kayak tour, which we did... but just be warned that it's really not a lot of kayaking, and the kayak tour company Dragonfly uses is unprofessional and subpar. You would do much better going with another company. We also went on their 'Bacardi Tour and Old San Juan Tour\", which picked us up at 8:30am and included so many stops to pick up other guests at other hotels, that we literally spent 1.5 hours at the Bacardi tour and 2.5 hours in Old San Juan, returning at 4pm... so the rest of the time was spent traveling and picking up people. We expected to see the inside of the Bacardi distillery... like how things work, etc... instead, you see a 10 minute video commercial for Bacardi, are given 2 drinks, and sent to the gift shop. I didn't learn too much on the tour, but you can buy some Bacardi wear at the store if you are in to that. Unfortunately for us, the day we went to Old San Juan was a Sunday and some meeting/protest was occuring, so many of the restaurants and shops were closed, and it was raining. So, not much to report there, although we did go to the fort which is a National Park. That was the only \"historic\" part of the tour that we were able to fit in in the 2.5 hours we were given to shop, eat, and look around.

Sometimes the water was not as hot as others and the water pressure in the shower fluctuated. We didn't spend any time at the pool ( I can go to a pool anywhere, I am a beach girl!). I loved the beach. There was really no seaweed to worry about. The sand was soft and there were plenty of chairs and umbrellas. The guys on the beach would set up your chairs and umbrella wherever you wanted them and they were so nice. We found several sand dollars walking the beach and you can walk the beach for miles which is nice! We never encountered a rude employee during our 3 night stay. We ate during company functions and the food was fabulous. Otherwise, we had a few wraps from the snack place by the casino and they were good. Oh we also had lunch at the restaurant near the beach. My husband didn't care for what he ordered (wings and quesadilla) I ordered pork chops and beans and rice and I thought they were good. I did notice the food was on the expensive side but there are local places close by to eat, which if we were to return, we would do that. We had a great time and would definitely return!

Check in was late at night (around midnight) and there wasn't a sole person around the check in desk, so i had to knock on the door behind. Check in was fast and all the rooms were on the same floor (4th). Self parking is a LONG way from the rooms, so i would advise to unload all bags at the front entrance. The rooms were all very nice. My room was supposed to be an oceanview, but all i really had a view of was a big palm tree in front of my balcony. The other rooms in our group were nice with nice views. The beds were comfy, the floors clean. TV worked just fine. Air Conditioning was good as well. The bathroom...well, the shower and tub needed a little TLC. And eventhough i hung my towel everyday so as not to be replenished, the maid still replenished it. Oh well...i tried... The hotel itself is very beautiful. Nice grounds. Clean and well manicured. The pool area which we visited each afternoon was nice. The first pool seemed to be the quiet adult pool. The second pool was more lively with volleyball games occassionally. The pool tiki bar service was SLOW...but much of the service our trip was SLOW...so no big surprise. Drinks were pricey...$11 for a frozen drink and $7.50 for a bottle of beer...but resort prices i suppose. The pool area had plenty of chairs and towels available...but we weren't trying to find a spot first thing in the AM.. The concierge was helpful..gave me a map to the El Yunque rainforest about 10 minutes away (which i highly recommend!). We ate at 3 restaurants in the Rio Mar while there. Breakfast at Malangas our first morning...NEVER again as it was $24 per person...and not worth it!! Dinner at Palio (Italian) which i found fantastic and not super expensive. Shimas for dinner was also good, service SLOW, but good food. Again, didn't think the prices were bad. We also grabbed desert a couple nights at the little bakery/dessert bar. Sometimes had a muffin, sometimes a milkshake. Both were VERY yummy. I visited the casino 3 times and the first night i went (Saturday) it seemed like all tables (all 5 or so) were open and i didn't have a hard time getting a seat at BJ. Won a little that night too...the second night (Sunday), there were only 2 BJ tables open and i waited a good hour to get a seat...another guy was getting mad and asked to open another table but apparently there weren't any dealers available. Finally got a seat and managed to lose all the money i won the night before...probably should have left because i was annoyed in the first place for having to wait so long to sit down...my last night (Monday) there was only 1 BJ table open and i waited about 20 minutes, played for about an hour and lost money. Decided to pack it in. VERY SMALL casino...cruise ships are even bigger...but entertaining none the less. I got my BJ fill. Overall, the resort was nice. The self parking is a bit of a joke as the spaces are so tight and SO far away...and $16 a day. I would go back again since it truly had everything that i needed!

Road noise did not bother us at all, and the lagoon was home to 5 or more iguanas and numerous turtles that we all enjoyed.

The activity \"kids\" pool had the same chairs; those in the adults-only pool had blue cushions on them. The sand is darker than many other areas of the Caribbean, but the beach is wide and long. I love a long walk on the beach, and this was one of the highlights of this trip for me. We didn't eat at the restaurants on the property, except for the breakfast buffet at Marisol, as it was included in our package. We still were charged ~$30 for taxes and gratuity, as well as for one child for each breakfast. I found that a little ridiculous; if the adults breakfast is part of the package, then I expected to not pay extra for my children. The buffet was quite good, with fresh fruits, made-to-order omelets and waffles, and an array of standards. We had nice meals out in Luqiuillo which were much more reasonable. Also, the self pay parking is now $15 a day plus taxes, which has gone up from the $10 a day I saw posted here.

There is an all adult pool which is very nice when you want to get away from the noise of music and kids. The beach is right near the pool so that you do not have to commute to get there (the way you do at some resorts in the area). The rooms are typical big hotel rooms.

My advise is to definitely pick up a rental car at the airport. This way you 1) don't have to pay for an expensive cab ride both ways, 2) can venture outside the resort for more local cuisine rather than paying the uber expensive prices at the 1-2 restaurants the resort has open, 3) can visit the rainforest which is not too far away, 4) don't have to pay the high car rental fees if you picked up a rental directly at the resort, and 5) travel into san juan as needed since there isn't any nightlife at the resort.

It was just over-priced and barely average. The Motel 8 I stayed at in Anchorage, Alaska has more to offer. We changed rooms 3 times at checkin the first night. (Our other family members changed 4 times each.) The 1st two rooms in East tower were DIRTY. The halls on the 4th floor weren't vac'd in ages. For the last room we were put in West tower, in Ocean Suite (at 9p). Was notably cleaner than other rooms but it still wasn't that clean and I had to rearrange the bedtables/bed to put it all back on the frame properly. First full day, I had a massage at the spa on property and ended up with severe bruises up and down my back, and legs. The bruises were deeper and darker on the side after I asked loudly for it to be lighter. The facial I had after the massage (same person) was amazing. The spa manager waived the cost of the massage and said the Spa Director would call us that day - its now been two weeks, no call. Because of the bruises, I couldn't sit/lounge by the pool very much the next two days. It took more than 10 days for the bruises to fade. During the first few days, our group actually tried to leave the property but we were told we would be penalized fiscally for that in addition to the added room costs for the new property = grin and bear it. The final two days of the trip improved when we figured out the following: The staff are beyond wonderful if you tip them generously at the first interaction. Think - like $25 for bringing you a drink at the pool. Do it. If you don't, it will easily be 1-1.5 hrs of a wait. Make all reservations as fast as you can at the Palio restaurant. It's the best/only decent restaurant there. The food made all of us so sick the first two days we spent the next two ordering PB&Js and/or eating small pizzas at the lobby bar. Also? Palio is the only place you can eat and hear one type of music while you eat instead of having two versions of muzak and a live singer with his keyboard. Book adventure tours before you arrive (the website said otherwise prior to our arrival and all things were booked when we got on site). Golf -- Don't bother. Particularly with the River Course. It isn't even maintained right now (rumor spread poolside that they were waiting on February renovations?). Its a round of golf the family wouldn't have paid $10 for and only added to the overall frustrations at the property. Since I spent so much time in the room icing the bruises on my back - a heads up on the TV - they are flat panel HDTVs but they are not appropriately set up with regards to aspect ratio and they are not HD. Try asking for a room with an air purifier. Ours had one, others in the family did not. The fridge another one of our family members was given had dented doors and wasn't cleaned out - they didn't use it. I ordered a grilled cheese one of these icing afternoons for room service and 2 hrs later I got a call they'd waive the cost of the sandwich and that it was on its way. ::eyeroll:: We went on our own for a day trip to San Juan and a day trip to El Yunque. The Casino HAS many black jack tables and two roulette tables but they will only ever open one -- including on New Years eve. It's also about the size of a small cruise ship casino. Oh? And we asked about the $120/pp banquet on NYE and the fireworks - we were told 12am-12:30. Fireworks went off continuously until 4:30AM along with shouts and cheers. Guests were allowed to do their own - so that felt really safe. Small thing: Not sure what the deal is with the coffee but it all comes from these push button machines and you never actually smell fresh coffee on the property. The trip to San Juan doubled as a \"please-get-real-coffee\" quest ;) Oh! And we've been home for a week now and it's the first day I'm not rubbing benedryl cream on my legs from the 30 minutes spent on the beach (with bug spray) one night doing a set of family pictures. Not everyone in the family was bit. Not sure the how/why on that! The marching band is only as great as its worst marcher = and that special marcher is this property.

They upgraded us from a mountain view to a beach view, albeit on the first floor at check-in. The days that this resort was a Westin with the Starwood decor and treatment are a distant past. While the hotel is on a rather large golf resort property right on the ocean there seems to be a lack of attention to detail. I will say the lobby was nice with its wide and very open spaces. There were quite a few annoyances though: 1. The property needs to be maintained-- the front of the hotel is not very attractive at all. 2. Drinks are very over priced except for the happy hour drink from 4-6 daily ( recommend having a car and driving to the grocery a couple miles away for alcohol and snack stock up) 3. When we checked in we decided to self park rather than valet. The self park garage is extremely dirty and very tight spaces. The elevator or escalator was broken and there were signs that told us to take the stairs. These signs were inadequate, and we as well as others, missed the right stairwell and ended up walking around the property, with bags in tow, finally having a guest opening up a side door. Needless to say, we valeted going forward. 4. You receive wash clothes and toiletries on check-in but you have to call and specifically ask for washcloths any other days because housekeeping doesn't have them. 5. The bathtub needs to be re-glazed, you can see spots of iron. There was also mold or dark grout in the shower that needs to be cleaned better or re-grouted. The water pressure in the shower was superior but the drains sucked--you always stood in at least 3-6 inches of water as you showered 6. The ceiling of the room had chunks of ceiling pealing off. 7. Several of the public bathrooms had absolutely no soap in any of the dispensers 8. There were missing canisters around light bulbs in one of the seating areas 9. They were very good at keeping the adult pool child free but did not maintain the pools or hot tub--there was always debris floating--at a resort at this price you would expect someone skimming the pool periodically throughout the day. 10. The restaurants were overpriced and lacked quality food, we did have a decent dinner on Christmas at what was known as the Grille before but I think is now called Estancia. The little cafe by the casino also had a good spinach wrap chicken sandwich for about $8. 11. None, I do say none of the casino slots paid. I played and watched others for a couple hours throughout the stay and I highly recommend staying out of this casino. 12. The soundproofing in the rooms is non existent. You could hear all conversations in the hallways and any sounds from your neighbors. One night we were woken at 11 pm because housekeeping was cleaning the room next door-slamming drawers, moving furniture etc. 13. There was very inconsistent towel policies and they always ran out of towels. At times they would give you a wristband, others they wouldn't, other days they didn't give them out but later came around and told you that you needed to get one. One of our neighbors at the pool went up and got a band for her and the other 3 people in her party and when I went up soon after they told me each person must come get their own. One time there was a family at the adult pool and pool boys came up and asked them to leave and reminded them everyone must be over 18. The family didn't leave. Another pool boy came up and told them everyone under 21 must leave...I was happy they addressed the kids being at the adult pool but train your people on what the policy is--I believe 18 is an adult. 14. We prepaid for our vacation and provided the required vouchers at check-in. we video checked out. Later I was billed again for the room. I called and left a message at the billing office and asked for a return call. After two days of no returned calls, I contacted my credit card company and protested the charge. After trying to reach someone for two more days in the billing office, I finally did reach someone, Elizabeth, who was extremely helpful and issued a credit. She said there is a problem with the video check out for prepays--so if you prepay don't video check out. In all, we won't be staying here again and unfortunately probably not another Wyndham property. I will say a lot of guests were very nice and we met a lot of great people.

This was our third golfing experience of our vacation, the most expensive and most forgettable of them. 1 - both courses are really built on a swamp and you can loss the ball in the mud on the fairways and in some cases this means the middle of the fairway. I realize this is the end of their rainy season but I was told by staff it never really truly dries up. The greens are nice and challenging with lots of bunkers with real sand. Not what we are use, just different. The challenge is from the size (often small) and the bunkers. I've never putted better than at this course. The fairways were in poor shape (lots of mud, even when you don't think there is any) and in some cases with a moss-like covering. Balls (and clubs) need to be cleaned every hole which is a good thing the club and ball cleaners are on the cart. The balls will not run on these courses and with all the water hazards (there are a lot of them) the courses can be unforgiving. The golf carts are fantastic with all the gadgets to enhance your golf experience. The rental golf clubs leave a lot to be desired (the budget TaylorMade or Callaway). I play with a variety of both these brands but the weight and shaft were definitely budget with high end rental price (60.00 per club rental...really). There is both a tennis facility and casino, can't comment on either as I did not use them. Food is way overpriced and not great. As we were only at the resort for three days we ate at the restaurants but the best food and price was the tiki-bar for lunch! Not good if you are on a budget or with a family. My final thoughts are first and last visit, overall a very underwhelming resort that is over priced. I will go back to resort golfing in Mexico thank you!", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Resort!!\u201d", "Author": "Dreak W", "ReviewID": "UR122321118", "Content": "Horrible service, food and decor!

Fantatstic Beach, great fun for all in the water with jet skiing and other water sports. The water keeps you alert, but not too scary, so little ones can jump the waves. Great beach to walk and not to busy with other hotels nearby. We had mountain view room on 7th floor. Gorgeous sunset view. i read reviews that said plumbing issues on lower floors. high floor was quiet and mimimal issues. refrigerator in our room as requested. The entire hotel decorated for Christmas beautifully. Nice little fun casino for after dinner fun as well as lobby bar for sports and signature drinks. Fun entertainment, i was selected for latin dancing and it was such fun and i looked good too! Far from Old San Juan. For us that wasnt an issue. Poolside activities and nice jacuzzi. Pet friendly as well, but dont let that scare you off, just minimal pets there. Restaurant advice: Marbella is great especially for lunch and breakfast was included and worth it. A few steps from the beach you can go inside and enjoy chicken soup with rice like my grandmother made and or wonderful salads with grilled chicken, way better than poolside and very clean. Palio is Italian and worth it, Tomato soup, pastas or anything with pasta or risotto...fabulous. we dined there twice. The Grille on the golf course is a great little change of scenery, not as crowded but a delicious meal and service over the top. Kudos to the chef at Marbella for escorting my daughter with Celiac around the buffet the first night and showing her GF options as well as making her pancakes and waffles in the morning. Thats a wow in my book! Also many GF choices at palio as well as Grille. I didnt care for Shimas and they told us a meal was GF after we suspected it wasnt. We were correct, the other 7 of us didnt love our meals eiher there and that was Christmas Eve. Golf course nice as per the guys. Property clean and perhaps a little old, but we met people that go year after year for the last 15 years and families of 20 or better meeting there. That says a lot for a resort in my book. The only issue i did have was check in. It was messy and although we did have 4 rooms, we couldnt even get 1 until after 4 and that was with a bug push. The luggage was never sent up until i went down and Jose helped me find it in the hold room. the adjoining room was ready and we needed to go back down to request it again. After waking up at 3:30 AM to get there at 1PM, i was pretty patient until Ana told us we could wait until 6PM to get all our rooms. I was ready to race to the executive offices at that point. This didnt start off our trip with a bang, but as soon as we settled, the fun did begin and the staff was wonderful after that point. I suggest a review of the ladies behind the check in desk. Work with the gentlemen, you will get a more calm, professional agent in my opinion. Oh and last but not least, the massage was wonderful, just be aware the service charge is added to the bill, so opt to tip in cash if you wish and advice that you have when paying. Juan was a doll at Marbella as was Melissa and dont leave without trying Puerto Rican French Toast! I hope to return and it would be with my whole family again. For just my husband and I, we prefer a larger casino, and a newer property. i see myself again there with my children and grandchildren one day! Beds and pillows very comfy. i havent slept so well since ive been home. Hotel is clean but the dishes outside doors werent picked up as quickly as you would expect.

We went on a Segway tour of Old San Juan, did a rainforest adventure with ziplines, rented a sailboat, chartered a fishing boat, and took surfing lessons. We definitely plan to go back. Our family of 4 booked 2 adjoining rooms for 5 nights in July with an ocean view. The rooms are nice but the climate in PR made the bed sheets feel wet, which took some getting used to. If you choose an ocean view room, get above the 4th floor or all you will see are palm trees. There were a lot of families there with lots of small and loud children during our visit. On a couple of nights when the kids were still running the halls and screaming at 2am we put towels under the door to try to get some sleep. The hotel really is perfect for families with small kids--pools, beach, and activities. The hotel is about a 30-minute drive from Old San Juan but we had a rental car so that wasn't a problem for us. If you plan to rent a car, do it ahead of time. There is an Enterprise Rental Car place in the hotel and we got a great rate and a nice car by booking in advance. If you get it once you get there, I heard it is about $100 per day. If you rent a car there you can take advantage of the reserved parking spaces just for the Enterprise cars. You also get a free day of parking with an Enterprise rental. It is true what other reviewers have said-- the parking garage is a nightmare. It is small, dark, dirty, wet, and almost always full. Parking attendants do not tell you if it is full. You just drive in, get jammed up with others looking for parking, turn around and go to the outdoor lot. The hotel really should do something about that garage! It is so out of place at this nice hotel with beautiful landscaping and fantastic pool areas. We did not eat at any of the restaurants but they have a nice snack bar area with pizza, sandwiches, desserts, etc. and the prices were reasonable. We also kept a cooler in the room for drinks.

Stayed here from 12/23/2011 thru 12/27. Location: Excellent for a relaxing resort-style vacation. Away from the hustle and bustle of San Juan, yet close enough via rental or cab. (Cab costs around $70 to SJ or airport and takes 45 mins). Very close to El Yunque rain-forest, and to Fajardo for the beaches/marina. Outside food is somewhat of a chore - you'll need a rental car and drive 15/20 mins. Beach access: Nice, virtually private, long, wide & swim-able beach with mild waves. No reef, so no snorkeling off the beach. Beach facilities include basics such as pool chairs, showers, life guards & swimming pool close by. NO water-sports right at beach, and we didn't see any hotel rental facilities such as boards, paddle-boats, kayaks, etc. This might be true for other hotels in PR as well - not sure. Swimming pool - Average. Kid's pool is better with a small slide. But not very big, so can get crowded. The adult pool and pool area is not very clean. Overall has an 'aged' look. Rooms - Average. Big enough, with a small verandah. Ours had two queen sized beds. All the usual amenities like TV, etc. Nice, big, clean bathroom with tub and shower. Not very sound-proof, so could hear flushing actions from probably upstairs - but not a big deal. Pay-to-use fridge. Hotel - Nice lobby and impressive view/facade from outside. Good looking golf course. Resort grounds are huge, green and quiet; but does not have that immaculate well-maintained look. Food - Expensive. The Marabella and Grille room food was quite good, though $$. The Japanese/chinese restaurant (Shiba?) was a disappointment and certainly not worth the $$. You'll need a car and venture out 10-15 minutes out of town (either east toward Fajardo or west toward SJ) to get to local food. And with small kids, the immediate vicinity restaurants may not be very 'family friendly'. There's a cafe where you can 'reasonably' priced snacks at all times, but low quality. And your in-room bottled water? $7 ! Service - Average. Big resort, so no 'personal' service. We didn't have any issues, so don't know how the resort deals with problems. Price - We booked as part of a package. PR during the Xmas break is expensive anyways, so we got value for our $. But its probably a 3+ -star resort, so make sure your room price reflects that. Note that they charge $20/day for car parking - not terrible. Overall - Its excellent location makes it a good choice for families, but don't expect 5-star quality or amenities, and don't pay 5-star price.

Overall, we had a good time and it is a nice resort, but not a great resort. Fortunately it was not a busy week so it was relaxing for us, which is what we needed. There were nightly rain showers, but we had good weather during the day. We agree with the previous reviewer who thought it was a bit boring. The grounds are very pretty, it has a nice pool area (though the adult pool lining needs renovation), the beach is right there with nice sand but dirty water, and we found all the staff pleasant and helpful. The food was good but expensive (as expected), we felt the menus were limited, and there was no outdoor dining at night. There is one main lobby bar and a casino, but no other nighttime entertainment. No live music except one night when they had a Flamenco dancer performing in the main restaurant. We planned our trip through Travelocity, and when we arrived we were given an upgrade to an oceanfront room which was nice, and we got all our other requests, such as a high floor to see over the trees. We had to switch rooms because of a very musty odor and a tub that wasn't draining. The second room was better but the drawers still smelled. Puerto Rico has had an unusual amount of rain lately, so maybe that was part of the problem, but we had to keep the sliding doors closed all the time, and still the room felt humid despite the constant A/C. I recommend keeping your clothes in your suitcase if possible. Other room notes, the walls could use repainting and more artwork, but the furniture seemed to be in decent shape, TV channel choices fair, tub was banged up, and the balcony furniture was just in fair shape. Sometimes we lost hot water while showering in the afternoon. We like a fridge in our room, which supposedly cost $10/day, but we didn't get charged. Also, we saw other people checking in with cases of bottled water (which we wished we had thought of doing on the way from the airport), but you can buy bottled water in the gift shop, and the tap water is drinkable in PR. There is an internet hot spot in one area of the lobby. There's a charge for in-room, unless you are a Wyndham Rewards member.

We planned to play golf on each of the two courses at the resort, but due to the recent rain, the Ocean Course was closed. We did play the River Course which was also extremely wet, and it was OK, but some of the greens were in poor shape. Callaway rental clubs were decent. After trying all the restaurants at the resort, we decided to try going local. We really enjoyed La Parrilla, a couple of miles away, and ate dinner there twice. We highly recommend it.

Plus it was convenient for our afternoon/dinner trip to Old San Juan to have a car. The hotel is about 35 minutes away from San Juan. We got the lower priced rooms because we didn't need incredible views from our room. We planned to be by the pool or the beach. We went to two of the on-site restaurants and also had lunch at the golf club pub. The food was decent enough at all places, though the italian place ended up being great. Brunch on site was perfect as were our massages. My massage was great! The hotel gym had plenty of equipment though it was tucked in a room next to the spa area. We only went to the adult pool, claiming our chairs with towels by 8am each morning (this was a trend for many). The beach was great, though we were only on it a bit. The water was super warm and that side of the island had good waves. The tiki hut would have been more fun except there were a good number of bugs there attracted to the syrups in the drinks. It didn't matter since the waitresses came by around lunch time to take drink and food orders at the pool. You don't need cash with you while at the hotel. Room number and name is all they are looking for. If you do want to go the more affordable beer option, you can order room service \"from the pantry\" and get a six pack for a reasonable price. If you get regular room service (not from the pantry) then be prepared to pay. Or you could also do a run to the fairly close Walmart and get a cooler, etc. There was a varied age range at the hotel. Younger folks there for a wedding, all ages for a conference, familes with kids (at the other pool). The casino was small, but entertaining enough for an hour or so at night. There was also a hotel bar near the casino that usually had some one playing the piano each night. The resort provides access to a golf course and other forms of activities...that we didn't take advantage of since we were happy with our pool situation. Overall, it was a very nice place to go to get away.

My review will not include much on drink and food prices since our company covered drinks & food for us. We arrived at the hotel via shuttle, which, I must tell you, the hotel is quite a haul from the airport...a good 40 minutes. This hotel sits on the OCEAN side, not the Carribean side, so if you are looking for white sandy beaches at this resort, you will not find them. The sand is brown, like a sandbox. And, yes, the stories about the sand fleas are correct. They do exist, as several in our group had \"run in's\" with them...hence, the reason I stayed off the beach & by pool and barside! The Tiki Bar was very nice wih great drinks & music. Bartenders are nice and pretty quick with service. The manager of the bar....his name escapes me, was just awesome and went out of his way to help any way he could. If you like coconut, buy a tropical drink in a coconut...I think it was $12...its neat to see them cut it open & drain out the coconut juice, and then insert your drink in the top. We didn't spend alot of time in our room, but I have included some pics of room # 5096 bathroom, that wasn't in the best condition and not so clean when we checked in. I should have requested another room, but didn't. the maids could do a little better cleaning the rooms because finding hair in the corner of your bathroom when you first check in is quite a turn off! We ordered room service for breakfast for 3 of the days...each day to be delivered between 8:30 & 9 am. We ordered the night before so shouldn't be a problem, right? WRONG. The first day was delivered at 9:15...second day at 8:15....no apology either time...hmmm...finally the 3rd day they got it right! Also, we were missing something on our order one of the days and noticed it after the server left the room. We call room service to request the item be brought to us, and they ARGUED with us thinking we were actually lying and got the order! We also asked for some extra butter...minor, yes? After they argued with us over the phone...they never brought our missing item OR the extra butter we requested....just ignored us. I would have thought they would have at least brought us the extra butter....but, no response. Worst room service in all the times I have had it, and I only get it on our company trips, so I don't ask for much, Restaurant wise, the Palio (Italian) is out of this world! Our waiter was top notch and very personable! Went to Shimas with some business associates another night, but unless you are a sushi/Japaneese food type fan, its no good. I am not, and didn't particulary enjoy it, except for the company. Everything is Shimas seemed to be slow, so plan on being there for a couple hours. The Casino is small but nice and centrally located off the very nice lobby area, but do not plan on winning there...very tight! The hotel lobby, pool and grounds are just beautiful.....our room was a little to be desired. It was sufficient, but a little better cleaning job and upgrading the rooms would make them much better. Our bathroom tub was patched all over...(see photos)...kinda yucky. Oh, and the walls ARE thin...you can hear your neighbors...and I think the tile floors in the rooms make it so there is nothing to \"absorb\" noise in each room. Many in our group complained about the quality of the rooms, so I know it wasn't just our room. Beds are very comfortable - I slept well. Yes, the prices for drinks are high, but you need to expect this at a resort type hotel anywhere you go...I have been to many and its the same everywhere. Bring your own food & drinks if you want to avoid the expense. On Friday nights, there is some live band in the hotel lobby, and it is LOUD..so loud, that after midnight in our room...on the 5TH FLOOR...we were trying to sleep and couldn't figure out where the low bass sound was coming from....well a quick phone call to the front desk answered that...band plays till 1 am! Now, if it was that loud on our 5th floor, I feel sorry for those on the Lobby floor just down the hall from the Lobby bar. Yikes! This definitely is a hotel suited for adults, not kids. There isn't much to do for kids except swim and go to the beach. I don't remember seeing any \"kid\" events, but I could be wrong...and, yes, unless you have pre-arranged shuttles and trip events planned, you will need a rental car (Enterprise is right on hotel site to rent) to go anywhere, since the hotel is set almost a mile back off the main road...nothing within walking distance. Spa is very pricey - $80 for a pedicure and $180 for a massage (30 min I believe) not including tip......eh...it could wait till I got home....again, resort prices....to be expected. Outside the resort - things to do - within 30-40 min driving distance on the island - Old San Juan..very cool....Bacardi factory tour - very interesting...and 4 hour catamaran sail, with snacks & drinks included - on the Carribean side, was incredibly beautiful! Our company provided the catamaran trip, but I remember hearing the concierge telling someone else it is about $150 per person to go...but, this is money well spent! I too, would rate this about a 3 star hotel, instead of a 4 star....I travel alot, and this hotel was nice but falls below the bar of a 4 star hotel as rated.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood\u201d", "Author": "estufilla", "ReviewID": "UR120800611", "Content": "Good and clean hotel.

I enjoyed a small dinner at the tapas bar. Negatives: Food and drink are pricey, and you're kind of a hostage to it because of the hotel's somewhat remote location. That's got to be how this hotel racks up profits; Wyndham has some nerve to ask $7 for a bottle of water! Also, the atmosphere of the hotel itself was that of a soulless, impersonal convention palace -- kind of like living in a shopping mall.

Children were free under 5 years old for the breakfast buffet. The waiters on staff were very friendly and helpful. POLIO was also kid friendly providing a kid menu and crayons with paper to entertain. THE GRILLE ROOM was also good for their appetizers, but I did not like the main meal. It was more upscale for the kid friendly meals. The best part of every day was going on the water slide in the family friendly pool for our 6 and 3 year old!!! TIPS: Book restaurants immediately for the dining time you want! You do not need to rent a car as everyone mentioned in previous tripadvisor reports. We had a wonderful selection of restaurants (as long as you booked ASAP) and there was a casual food place next to the casino for continental food or a large pizza pie for the family!

Here are some new tips and our impression for this resort. Wyndham Membership - Unless you're already a member and you booked through Wyndham it's pointless to join. There are no benefits. Room Food Service - Besides the room service menu there's a pantry service for rented refrigerators ($10 a day) that includes various drinks and snacks. Pool & Activities - There's a tiny pool for little ones to play in which includes water fountains. Every morning board games are placed at various locations. There are a number of vendors located on the pool grounds from tattoos to gifts daily. Restaurants - If you don't have a reservation ask if they can still serve you. Palio accommodated us in the Lobby Bar without reservations. Check out the lounge menus as an alternative to the main restaurants. Pool Restaurants - The Tiki Bar only accepts room or credit card charges. No cash. Might be similar at Sea Breeze. Sea Breeze has a Kid's menu. If you are looking for something specific ask cause some items are not listed like adult size order of chicken fingers and fries. Beach - Visit the beach/river area during low tide. It's located towards the right side as you enter the beach. Better water conditions, less waves and wonderful views. Entertainment - A pianist played standards nightly in the Lobby Bar. There were also various Latin players featured in the Boleros Lounge a few nights. However, we're not sure if this is consistent. Internet - While they provide some computers for access the connection is terribly slow. Also, out of five computers only two worked. Unless you have your own service don't count on internet service. Parking - When leaving the garage let the attendant know you will be coming back. You simply sign a form with your room number. Impression - While this resort was nice to stay we traveled daily to other places. If you like to lounge around the pool/beach and don't mind resort expenses then this place will do just fine for you. However, if you really want to experience the truly beautiful attractions of Puerto Rico then a car rental is a must have!

I was traveling with a larger group on a golf vacation. Overall, this is a wonderful resort with superb staff and great facilities. The Details: Grounds - absolutely beautiful. Well maintained and clean public areas, pool, and beach. Pool area had plenty of seating (occupancy was over 95% on the last two days) and poolside wait service was prompt and friendly. There were plenty of chairs and umbrellas on the beach also. Hotel - beautiful lobby and public areas on main floors (1 and 3). Clean, well maintained and spacious even when at almost full capacity. There were places to get away from the crowds on these levels. There were sofas and chairs tucked into quieter spots and floor to ceiling windows looking out on the grounds and ocean. On the 6th floor the common hallways were freshly painted (signs still on the walls), but the carpet looked a bit worn. Some areas of the exterior could use a power washing. This was mostly higher floors near corners of the buildings. Check in was fast and easy. Front desk staff were always pleasant and very helpful. Jessica was extremely helpful in helping us figure out if there would be a room for an extra night if we couldn't get home because of the snowstorm in Boston. We self parked ($16 per day) but the bell staff was always friendly and helpful when we arrived back with golf clubs or packages. Room - I was very happy with the room. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Linens and towels were better quality and very clean. The bathroom was spacious and clean. I really liked the large shelf behind the sink to store toiletries and personal items. The room was equipped with a decent sized safe (would have accomodated a normal sized laptop), extra pillows, blankets, ironing board, and iron in the good sized closet. Body and Bath brand toiletries provided were very nice. The decor was tasteful. The sliding door to the patio was somewhat cloudy. The balcony was clean and had a small table with two chairs. The view was phenominal - over the pool and straight out to the ocean. Housekeeping was stealth - we never saw them but the room was always clean and we had more towels. The room also had a large desk and chair, dresser with 6 drawers, and a large flat screen tv. Food/Drinks - overall decent and definitely \"resort\" prices. The Tiki Bar and Grill has a drink special everyday so if you can be flexible with what you drink you can save some money. The tuna salad sandwich was great, the Mahi Mahi sandwich was just ok, and the grilled cheese was lousy. Towards the end of the week when it became busy our orders got a little messed up (wrong sides, drinks we didn't order arrived). Our package included breakfast at Marbella every morning. The menu was your average hot buffet offerings - including an egg/omellette station. The selection and food quality were good and the waitstaff was superb. We never had to wait for coffee, juice, or our check when we were ready to leave. We had the same waiter most days (\"Winnie\") and he was fantastic. The snack bar (ERL) had some fantastic desserts (Coconut Kisses and Chocolate Mousse) and their cheese pizza was pretty good. We ate most dinners off the property. We did try to order a late dinner from room service one night but they did not answer the phone. After 20 minutes of trying room service we went downstairs and ordered some risotto from Palio to go and it was quite good. Others in our party raved about the scallop and risotto dish there. Spa - I had a 50 minute massage at the spa. The facilities are very nice and Eleanor gave a great massage. She had some very helpful tips for me after the massage to reduce strain on my back. My time there was very relaxing. Golf - I played both the Ocean and River courses. October is off season and the greens were in transition on both courses so I can't speak to their speed or playability. Other than the greens, both courses were in fantastic shape and beautifully maintained. Both were very playable (unlike the El Conquistador- beautiful course but very difficult to play) but offered challenges along the way. While I was there there were a couple of heavy overnight rainfalls so the courses were pretty wet (the River course more than the Ocean). The scenery, wildlife, and backdrops (El Yunque Rainforest and the ocean) were breathtaking. Bring a camera with you when you play! The Ocean course only has one hole on the ocean (the 16th - a par 3) but it is a breathtaking and tough hole with the wind. i thought the River course layout was fantastic. The pro shop and clubhouse staff were exceptional (as we found most staff to be all over the resort) and if you stop at the snack hut after the 9th hole on the River course William will always make you smile! The shuttle to the course ran a continuous loop so there was never more than a 10 minute wait.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cRio Mar: great golf, hotel and staff\u201d", "Author": "Gary B", "ReviewID": "UR119952774", "Content": "Just returned from Rio mar with a group of 16 arranged by Dave G of Golf & Gamble.

There was unidentified garbage that appeared to be left over food wrapped up, between mattress & head-board. Only found it cause I dropped my hair band. We notified the front desk & after a quick apology, our room was deep cleaned & sheets cleaned. That was all my negatives over a seven night stay, so not too bad. Overall I love this resort & plan to return. I was a little disappointed in the lack of reaction in my reporting my findings behind the mattress, I was thinking the grossed out factor deserved free parking or room service!

The resort was gorgeous! It is way up far away from the surrounding towns. The golf course was down though because they had flooding and trees that were down from the storm. Our room was nice, we had the mountain view, which was gorgeous. The room did have a fridge which was great because we brought a whole case of water with us instead of spending $7 for a bottle of water. The beach was great....we walked up and down the beach almost every day. The tiki bar which is right next to the pool/beach is great for drinks and pub food (take advantage of their 2 for 1 deals!) For a couple you can plan to spend about $50 for each meal...there are few restaurants in the hotel and they are expensive. The casino is very small, we didnt spend much time there. we did the bioluminescent bay tour which is a must see! it was so beautiful. We were dissappointed that the rainforest was closed while we were there, but we did get to do the horseback riding which goes along the bottom of it. we had a great time doing that eventhough we are beginners. we also went to old san juan for the day...lots of shopping and dining there. You have to watch out there because there are people that try to con you for money, so be sure to watch your things. the pool is also were we spent alot of our time. the adult pool is very relaxing. It gets very hot there and the sun is strong so make sure to pack sunblock! Overall we had a great time and thought the resort was accomodating to us. there is not much to do there at night though so be prepared to leave the resort at night if you want to go out.

The hotel seems to have slipped slightly in some areas from two years ago. This review is based on our experience during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off season,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so things may be drastically different if you go during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high season.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd First, the good points: The rooms are still very clean and well maintained. The indoor areas are very nice and they still have live music in the lobby on weekends. Service at the one restaurant we ate at (Palio) was good. The areas that have slipped: There was some trash and debris around the adult pool Jacuzzi (we did not go in the family pool). There was no wait staff on any day at the pool area. The service at the lobby bar was terrible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our orders were all incorrect, food took forever to arrive and our waiter appeared to go on break and we had to hunt down someone to close out our tab. We were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to a room with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ocean view. Unfortunately, it was on a very crowded hallway surrounded by very loud families and we were clearly a couple traveling alone. There were very few families in the entire place, so it seemed odd for us to be stuck in the middle of what appeared to be all of them. When I complained, it feel on deaf ears. Overall, we would stay here again because it is a convenient location and on the beach where we get wave sounds, but it is not as nice as it was last time and is probably over-priced for what you get. Some advice if you are staying here: Visit the Kiosks in Luquillo! We did not last time and could have kicked ourselves after discovering them this time! We ate at 4 of them and the food was amazing at each one. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be intimidated when driving in because of the large crowds of local kids at the first few restaurants and the overall appearance of the buildings. The best food we ate on the entire island was at numbers 13, 2 and 21. We also had fritters at #60. They were excellent. I have written reviews on each kiosk individually. The pricing is a little less than the hotels, but the quality of the food is definitely far greater than large resort food. Also, if the waves at the beach outside the resort are too strong, then visit the beach in Luquillo. There are practically no waves and the beach is very nice and clean.

That this hotel is referred to as a 'great resort' by some is somewhat subjective and puzzling. For someone like me who has been around the world and stayed in really nice hotels (Australia, Africa, India, Japan and Europe), Wyndham Rio is average at best. Here are my thoughts: The good: * Grounds are well maintained. * Lobby is impressive, clean and luxurious. * Restaurants are good (but food is salty, like everywhere else on island). * Staff is helpful and friendly. The bad: * Restaurants are very expensive with somewhat slow service. * In terms of quality of materials and decor, rooms are just a notch above Holiday Inn. * Bathroom was very average. Looked good at first sight but quickly showed its average quality upon further inspection. Like room, hard to describe...you'll understand when you see them. * Alcohol in bars and restaurants is expensive. * In-room refrigerators are available, but for a fee. * On a daily basis room service trays were left outside rooms (in hallway) for hours before finally being picked up. Not hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault if guests leave them outside, but Ritz or Four Seasons hotels would take them away quickly. * Hallways are no better than in an average hotel. Carpet was worn and old, some wallpaper was peeling and there were a few noticeable dents and scratches on walls. * You have to give up your beach chair and umbrella by 5pm! After that you're out of luck. I could perhaps understand if they did it 1 hour before sunset, but not at 5 on the dot in the summer! * Adult pool is worn and needs to be rebuilt. Bottom is patched up and clearly in need of repairs. Also, there were hundreds of little (1\") white crabs thriving in pool which lead me to wonder if they use chlorine? * Casino is small, dirty and terrible. Never once did a waitress drop by and ask if I wanted a drink (after losing $60 playing slots in 1 hour). Beach sand on damp chairs and carpet, and staff looked bored. Bar inside casino was closed (indefinitely) and entire place felt dull. * Parking garage casino elevator entrance smelled like urine. * Not a cheap hotel - inexcusable given what they charge per room. * Pool-side massage and spa ridiculously expensive. Almost what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d pay at the Mandarin Oriental, but this is not the Mandarin. * Overall, hotel was disappointing and felt somewhat dirty (except for lobby and gardens). Maybe if they stopped calling it a resort, and charged less, people would have lesser expectations and enjoy it more. Tips: * Try at least one of the hotel restaurants. Food is good, but salty and service is slow. * Casino sucks! Not sure what else to say about it other than you will lose your money there if you gamble. * Breakfast buffet is not too bad, but overpriced and nothing special given what they charge for it (your standard boring hotel breakfast buffet). Just your average cheese selection, cold cuts, cereals, uninspiring fruits, doughy pastries, pancakes, omelets, bacon...a Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast in buffet format. What happened to island specialties like roast pig? Selection was as original as a breakfast buffet in a large city hotel. Save your money and drive down the road (PR-968) towards PR-3, where there are a couple of mom and pop restaurants. Nothing amazing, but cheaper than what hotel charges. * For lunch or dinner, go a couple of miles east on PR-3. On left side of road you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshacks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which are actually restaurants. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably 30 of them in one row; some bad and somewhat seedy, others that are excellent. * Try the roast pig (Lechon) around Cayey. Lots of restaurants in area and lots of choices; drive around and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick first one you find. * Try Richie's restaurant just up the road.

First impression driving up the long drive is that the entire resort looked tired and after staying there for a week it was confirmed. While some things have been updated it is all superficial. The first night our door to our room would not open up with our key, I went and got it rekeyed and it would still not open. Not even a red light would flash. I complained and they sent maintnence to take a look. At this point they tell us to just listen to the door and after the first mechanical sound to hit the door above the lock and then press down on the handle. They were able to get it open after three or for tries but it took my boyfriend many more and I couldn't get it. After wasting an hour of our time the were nice enough to give us a new room with a door that opened but neither room was the 4 star quality they advertised. The rooms have been remodeled sort-of. The bathrooms have new sinks but old floors and tubs and the water takes about 5 min to warm up. The bedroom was fine. Tiled floors and a comforable bed with clean linens, yet when you opened the drapes to enjoy the view along the bottom of the sliding door there was a signifacant amount of mold. It rained one morning and about an inch of rain accumulated on our patio and did not drain. The food was average and not cheap but not out of line with what I have seen at other similarly advertised resorts. We had much more fun venturing out in our rental car and eating at some local places. The pool area, grounds and beach were a bit dated yet well maintained and we enjoyed our time out there. The bugs (sand mites, no-see-ums and mosquitoes) were very bad-bring bug spray. (It's not bed bugs like some say). Overall we had a great time but not because of the hotel, because of the rainforests, Old San Juan, our snorkel trip and the beaches. We are younger and not that picky while I have stayed at many worse places I have also stayed at many many better ones. We did use time share exchange points so it was very cheap.

Like others have said before, I was somewhat apprehensive about what I had gotten myself into with the Rio Mar. I had read more than a fair share of negative critiques. Let me tell you -- pay NO attention to them whatsoever. The Rio Mar and its grounds are beautiful and immaculately maintained. I agree with some of the reviews that the hallways could benefit from new carpeting. But with that being said, the rooms themselves are spacious and well decorated. The room floors are TILED. I enjoyed that aspect of it, it was another way to keep the room cool. The pools are gorgeous and clean. I particularly appreciated that \"kids\" were not allowed in the adult pool area. The beach was clean and Rio Mar had attendants who would set up an umbrella and bring out lawn chairs for those wanting/needing them. The ocean was perfectly fine for swimming. There were waves, but nothing that would prohibit anyone wishing to swim. The drinks at the pool and Tiki Bar are $11.00. Sure it's pricey, but I live in Chicago and I have paid close to or MORE than that for Mai Tais. I had no problem paying that for a DELICIOUS, carefully crafted drink that was hand delivered to me while on the beach. For those who think it's too much, pick up a six pack of Zima somewhere and go crazy. The Marbella Restaurant was a good way to start the day for breakfast. Again, I have read reviews denigrating Marbella, saying it was too expensive. The breakfast is buffet style (though they do have a separate breakfast menu) with lots of local grown fruits. I can honestly say they had the best cantaloupe I have EVER had in my life. On Friday, August 26th, they had Noche de Boricua featuring cuisine and music of the island. The chicken and beans and rice were almost as good as mi abuelita used to make! The Palio Restaurant specialized in Italian Cuisine and was superb and the waitstaff perfection. Attentive without hovering. One last thing about the Rio Mar staff: they couldn't be friendlier, more helpful and accommodating if they tried. Truly a remarkable staff who seem to enjoy what they do. Everyone from the Gift Shop to Frieda at Marbella, the staff make the Resort that much more special. You most definitely will need to rent a car or expect to pay exorbitant taxi fares.

They are amazing and a good value. I'm with everyone on making a pit stop at Amigo before getting to Rio Mar. it's on Route 3 about five minutes from the resort.

My one major complaint was the parking and the parking garage. I despise being charged for parking at hotels, though that does seem to be the trend in the travel industry -- to nickel and dime vacationers to death. As for the garage, it is poorly designed to start with, plus on Friday and Saturday nights when there are parties and dancing going on at the resort the parking garage fills up leaving no place for guests to park. To the hotel's credit, they did allow us to use valet parking and took off the difference in cost. Oh...the live music played on the lobby floor on Friday and Saturday nights lasts until past 1:00 and can be heard in the rooms unless the TV is on. By the way, I highly recommend having a rental car. As for the hotel, we had a view of the ocean -- they upgraded our room from a mountain view. However, you cannot go wrong with either the view of the mountain and rain forest or the ocean! It looked like all rooms had balconies. The hotel is on the verge of being an exceptional resort if a little more time and effort were applied to its upkeep. There was a poor patchup job behind our room door where the knob had evidently put a hole in the wall. The tub was obviously quite old and was stained.

My husband and I traveled to PR for our first anniversary. Yes, the rooms don't have as many amenities as other Wyndham resorts, and they are a little outdated, but we did our research before going, so this was not a shock. First tip: rent a car! That was one of the first tips that I read in researching the property. Car rental is relatively cheap if you know where to look. We were even upgraded to the same model SUV that I drive everyday anyway. We did a biobay tour, repeatedly visited the Luquillo kiosks, drove out to Arecibo and old San Juan, and drove as far as possible into the rainforest before selecting a trail to hike. The price of the car for a week plus the few expenses we had for tours we booked on our own were much cheaper than booking through the resort. Second tip: stop at the Wal-Mart on your way to the resort and pick up a Styrofoam cooler and your favorite adult beverages, as well as snacks the will keep well. You can take anything down to the pool and no one will bother you. When we checked in (very late at night!), we asked about an upgrade, but there were 2 conferences on site and the place was booked! We were given a room on the first floor facing the pool and did not care for it. We asked for a change and were immediately moved to a higher floor, facing the rainforest, with the on-property nature preserve right outside our room. The property is wonderful. We thought all of the common areas, inside and out were beautifully maintained. Having the beach so close was amazing, although it is not the cleanest beach I have ever seen. We ate a few times at the pool bar and the lobby bar and Iguana's Pub, but not so much at the other restaurants, mainly because we were out and about so much during the week. The food and drinks were a little pricey, but, again, we knew what we were getting into before arriving and budgeted accordingly. Richie's, up the street from the resort, has a gorgeous view and the food/drinks are a little cheaper. But watch out for their signature drinks because you will spend twice as much as the resort! (But they are so good!) It's hard to find, but watch for signs along the road ;) We visited the concierge desk just about every day before heading out on our excursions. The staff was very helpful. Ask for the best directions to drive to Old San Juan and they will give you parking recommendations and a run down of the best restaurants and attractions. We planned to see the Bacardi factory, but we were told the locals thought Bacardi was swill and to drink DonQ instead. Loved it so much that we brought many bottles home! We also visited the pool bar almost every day for happy hour... 2 for 1 rum punch! On the last day of our trip, we rented a cabana (which we received for free by attending the owner update). When we scheduled the cabana, we had no idea which one we would possibly want, but the guy who set us up gave us the best (#4) available, right along the adult pool. The cabana came with a cooler full of assorted sodas (and plenty of room to add your own favorite adult beverages) and a basket of snacks. Around lunch time, they delivered fruit salad, and they had servers to bring you anything else that you need. We had 2 issues at check out - we were charged 9 days of parking when we only stayed for 7, and our cabana rental was not properly credited. Both issues were fixed immediately after a quick stop at the front desk. Overall, the rooms could use an upgrade, but they are still very nice.

It has gone down hill since Westin sold it to Wyndham. The lobby of the resort and the grounds including the pools are still very nice and you will enjoy them. The problem is, that is where it ends. The rooms are ridiculous, they are in need of being up dated and need a thorough cleaning. Our \"Ocean Suite\", really a big guest room with extra space, stunk of mildew so bad that I had three air fresheners in there and I would spray constantly, but nothing helped. The furniture, couch and chair stunk so badly that I would not even sit down. I guess you are wondering why I did not switch rooms, well I did, four times and they all smelled the same. In addition to having that horrible smell all the furniture always felt damp and wet and it is also out dated and needs to be replaced. All the concrete around the sliding glass door, both inside and out, looked rusty and needs to be repaired. The other thing about the room was that you had to keep the air conditioning on BLAST at all times or the room would become swampy and the tops of the furniture, the mirrors and the floors get wet and the floors are slippery, as they are tile. When the housekeeping dept. came to open the sofa bed I asked about the air conditioning with relationship to what happens to the room and they said you have to keep it really cold or it gets wet. Wonderful, 90 during the day outside and 40 degrees when we went to bed. I actually considered sleeping at the pool but my husband thought I was crazy. The food is rather expensive but the real problem is that it was terrible. I mean terrible as in you will not be able to eat it, sometimes. The buffet breakfast was good and the lunch at the pool was adequate but otherwise the food was lousy. I strongly recommend you leave the property to eat. In order to leave the property you absolutely need a car. There is nothing immediately around the hotel. If you have a car the charge is 20 a night for valet or 15 a night for self park. Added to that charge are two taxes. If you do self park the area you park in is underground and disgusting. The concierge is a waste of time. No matter what you ask for their only advise is to do it in the hotel. For example, I asked for a good Italian restaurant and they said to go to Palio; I asked for good pizza and they told me the little quick food kiosk outside the casino; we asked about zip lining they only wanted to tell us about the tour company they have there. In addition, be prepared to be asked to take part in their time share program. I think it was time share, but I know for sure they wanted you to go do something to buy into the condos they are building. You will also be constantly asked about attending one of these things at the pool when you request your towels. Generally, the concierge staff is useless so do your investigating before you go. Housekeeping was fair at best. If you stay a week they will probably skip your room at least once. You never get everything on any given day, sometimes no bath towels, other days no face cloths, others no coffee packets. If you have an accomodation that has a sofa for other people to sleep on, they will open it the first night and then never close it, so you never get to use the sofa, as a sofa, not that you would want to. Another small problem was that you are not allowed to bring any coolers, even small ones that fit only two drinks, to the pool area. They want you to buy their drinks, which are not cheap and not large, they actually have people walking around, like pool police, and if they spot any beverage that does not appear to be purchased from the pool bar, they will ask you to get rid of it. Finally, the last complaint I had was that on the two weekends that we were there, the occupation of the hotel was increased drastically with local people who come for the weekend; they check in on Friday and leave after breakfast on Sunday. While they are there it is really crowded and you wait for everything.

I read tripadvisor reviews months before our planned trip, so I kind of knew what to expect, but I have to say that Puerto Rico is a world of its own. It may be a US territory, but it's nothing like the US at all, other than having US chain restaurants, Walmart, and Kmart. The beaches at the Rio Mar were fairly clean, as long as you stay right in front of the resort. If you walk to the east, you will see a good bit of trash, but you will also get a beautiful view of El Yunque and a river that flows down into the ocean. We never had a problem getting chairs on the beach or around the pool. Towels were sometimes an issue, though. At our US beaches, the lifeguards start setting chairs out on the beach @ 7 AM, but that's not so in PR... they live on island time. Everything is done @ a leisurely pace (restaurant service included). We never ate at the restaurants at the resort because of the high prices. We ate in Luquillo at the kiosks or in Fajardo. These towns are 5-15 minutes away on Rt 3, but you really should rent a car to get there. I've heard taxi prices can be expensive. As far as excursions... if you rent a car, just book excursions through the companies, not the resort. East Island is good and that's who the resort uses, but the cost is much more through the resort. Maid service, room service we never used because we don't like people in our personal space, but we heard through other vacationers that their rooms were never cleaned, or either they wouldn't clean them until really late. Puerto Rico was really beautiful, but you must go in with an open mind. I can see how some people hate it because the island has a lot of trash. It seems like the islanders just lack the pride that I'm accustomed to where I live. A lot of them have an \"I don't care\" attitude, but don't let that ruin it for you.

The size, of course, has its drawbacks - you almost have no choice but to dine in the hotel's restaurants, because anything else is pretty far and hard to locate. That said, we had an occasional drive to a store outside of the hotel territory to have some fruit and water, because the food and drinks are expensive in the hotel. The rainforest is very close (this was my first visit to a rainforest so I was absolutely excited), the beach is nice and huge and if you request you can find some watersports available there (my husband attempted kiteboarding, but the wind was no good for that). Plenty of iguanas are wondering around, a nice room with AC and a great balcony (we had a sea view), and the spa was great too. One more important thing to notice - I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of service, not only in the hotel, but everywhere in Puerto Rico - from the rainforest staff to the cafes in San Juan everyone was very helpful and thoughful.

We were not satisfied with either of these rooms so they showed one other room- room 3130 on the with an clear view of the beach. We took this room, and the view greatly improved the stay.

While it was convenient to have your car brought to you, it was subpar. The valet is relatively disorganized. They take a while to find your car, employ an odd system of giving a new ticket every time you bring your car, and are just generally not as enthustiastic about their job as every other staff member.

If your vacation goal is to take a vacation full of relaxation and soak up the beach then this is the place. If you want to dine at 5 star restaurants every night...then this is the place. However if you want to be constantly entertained and are looking to party every night till the sun comes up then there are a few things that should be mentioned. Number one, the resort is breathtaking and beautiful. It's a 4-5 star resort so don't think that you are going to be staying at a tacky Sandals all inclusive resort. that serves cheap drinks and food. I say this because I have read other reviews on here where people are complaining about the cost of food and that there is no entertainment. This is partially true but there are other options that are available. There is not much to do at the resort itself but relax at the gorgeous beach, pool or in the spa. Aside from that you have to leave the resort if you are looking for more action. We found that the conceirge \"Coden\" was very helpful. He advised us to dine at a local restaurant called \"Guavas\" which was delicious and offered a nice variety of local cuisine. Afterwards we went to a bar right next door that had live entertainment and Rum-Punch. It was nice to venture out and get into a local scene. We took a cab ride there and back which cost us 30.00 round trip. The following day we did take a tour of Old San Juan which was really fascinating. The tour lasted all day. There was alot to see and we were able to walk around old San Juan and do some shopping etc. By the fourth day we took a cab ride and went to los kioskos which are located in Loquillo about 8 minutes away. There are about 50 restuarants/bars and vendors to choose from. The food is very inexpensive. We were able to order some appetizers and taste some of the local food again. On the nights that we didnt go out we dined at Palio's and the Argentian restaurant which were both excellent. The food and service was awesome and well worth what we paid. In the mornings, we would order from the cafe downstairs. We found that splitting a breakfast sandwich was all we needed to fill us up till lunchtime. Breakfast would cost normally around 13.00 with 2 coffees. We did dine in Marbella for breakfast but it is expensive so be advised. If you stay here do not feel as you are stranded...there are plenty of places to see and venture out to. We found that taking cabs was more convenient than having to deal the hassle of renting a car. One reason is we had a designated driver, secondly I wouldn't recommend taking a car unless you plan on scoping out the entire island, thirdly they do drive kind of crazy down there. One great thing to mention about the cab drivers is that they were very accomodating as well. They would give us their cell numbers and we were able to call them to come get us when we wanted them to. Overall our experience was memorable! The staff at this hotel is very accomodating and friendly. We will be back for sure!

The hotel is in a great location... About 30 minutes outside of San Juan.... 20 minutes from Fajardo... 5 minutes from El Yunque. Although we enjoyed ourselves, the hotel missed the mark on a few things during our stay. I'll start with the bad... Upon arrival, my husband and son (12 years old) parked the car (we rented a Nissan Rogue from Economy/Target - Great rates!!) while my daughter (15 years old) and I went to check in. Check in was smooth, and the front desk staff was very helpful, unfortunately we encountered our first problem at this point when we were told that we would not be eligible for any of our Wyndham ByRequest / Wyndham Rewards perks because we had booked our hotel stay through a travel agent. I own a Corporate Event Planning Company and have never experienced this at any hotel, but since it was only the wireless internet access that I really needed, I didn't make a big deal out of it, as they have wireless available to everyone in the lobby area. We arrived in our room (#7113, Ocean Front, West Wing), and although it was a bit dark, the view from the balcony couldn't be beat, so we were fine with the room. Our second issue was when we tried to open the balcony door (which was not a sliding glass door because of the way the room was situated, but an actual glass door) and discovered that the hook lock was stuck and required banging on it with something to get it open - This had to be done each time we wanted to open the door, but again, not a big issue, so we were still fine. We also realized that the roman shade covering the door was broken and wouldn't raise all the way, but again, not a huge deal. Issue #3 (or 4 depending on how you're looking at it) was unfortunately a bigger one when we realized that there were tiny ants all over the floor near the balcony door, but on the inside. Since we had already unpacked, and everyone was starving at this point (left our house at 5am, and it was now close to 7pm), I called down to Guest Services and explained the situation and asked if they could have Engineering come up and spray the room while we were gone. I also realized at this time that the balcony had very poor drainage (was only covered by a pergola) and since it had rained that day, there was about an inch of water on the balcony, so I asked if they could also have them \"squeegee\"(for lack of a better word) off the water so we could actually use the balcony area. Guest Services was more than accommodating and said that someone would be up within a 1/2 hour to do both things and that we would need to be out of the room for at least another hour after that. We came back later that evening and neither request was taken care of... No spraying.... No squeegeeing. After our second requests were ignored, we bought a can of ant spray to get rid of the ants, and used a bathroom towel one morning to direct all the water on the balcony toward the two drainage holes - Took about 1/2 hour, but worked like a charm!! ;o) Our final issue was discovered one night when we returned from a late dinner and realized that our balcony door was wide open. It was raining when we left, so we know we did not leave it open. I'd like to think they finally came to squeegee, and forgot to shut the door, but with another inch of water on the balcony after the rain, we're pretty sure that wasn't the case. Now for the pros of this property... The beach is wonderful, and they have plenty of chairs and umbrellas for everyone - We only had an issue one day when they ran out of umbrellas (not chairs), but it was a holiday weekend, and the hotel was full. The pool area is fantastic as well, and they have daily activities (ie. Bingo, Water Aerobics, etc.). There is an adult only pool, a kiddie pool and an activity pool with a water slide. The Tiki Bar right next to the pool had fantastic drinks (albeit expensive - Bring your own liquor and mixings if you are concerned) - The Mojitos and Pina Coladas were great! They even gave my son a lesson in how to open a coconut, which he thoroughly enjoyed! I can't tell you much about the restaurants on the property as we only ate at the breakfast buffet and coffee shop - Having Italian or Sushi while in Puerto Rico wasn't what we were after. The buffet was ok, and definitely the way to go if you like a large breakfast - We ordered a la carte one morning (we aren't huge breakfast eaters), and the cost was higher than if we had just gone with the buffet. They also don't have fruit on the menu unless you go with the buffet. :o( The beds in the rooms are very comfortable - A cross between a pillow top and feather bed - Loved it!! Restaurants in the area... We ate at the Loquillo Kiosks a few nights and thoroughly enjoyed them. Vejigante was our favorite (don't ask what number it was as we lost track of the numbers along the way) - They couldn't have been more helpful, and the food was GREAT!! La Parilla (first kiosk if coming from the west) was also very good, but more expensive than most of the others. We also ate at one or two that were just walk in and order type places - We plan to detox from all the fried food this week!! lol We also ate at Ritchies which is to the right, about 1/2 mile, if you are pulling out of the hotel property. The view is gorgeous, the food was great, and their Sangria was superb! What to do... We went into El Yunque one day and had a great time walking around many of the areas. We also drove into San Juan - We parked by San Cristobal and walked through Old San Juan all the way over to El Morro - If you go, plan on wearing comfortable shoes as it is a lot of walking (unless you take the trolley, which is free, and which we didn't use), as well as walking on a lot of uneven terrain. If you get in early, or even if you want an afternoon snack, stop in at La Bombonera for some Mayorcas! We had lunch at the Parrot Club, and although at this point I can't remember what we ate, I'm sure it included Tostones (fried green plantains)!! :o) We also did one of the BioBay Tours in Fajardo, which is a DO NOT MISS kind of tour!! We went with Island Kayaking Adventures and they did a wonderful job. Since we had our own car, we drove to the site in Fajardo (was about $54 pp), which is near the El Conquistador Resort (not easy to find). Our tour was kayaking, and although definitely not easy to do, well worth the effort. If you have anyone in your group who wouldn't like being in a kayak in a small channel, in the dark, I suggest you find one of the two tour companies that use electric boats. ;o) If you are adventurous, and can laugh at things that might go wrong (ie. banging into the mangrove trees, causing a 6 kayak pile up, etc.), then this tour is definitely for you.... And the BioBay itself is magical! We had planned to do the ziplining, but couldn't find a tour that was not an all day, 6-8 hour excursion. Hopefully our next trip will include that as it is the only thing we had planned to do that we didn't. All in all, the trip was wonderful, and although the hotel has a few kinks to work out, they have a wonderful property and location to work with, and I would still suggest this hotel to anyone going to Puerto Rico. I would however suggest going with an Ocean View room rather than Ocean Front - I was able to peek into a couple and they had a beautiful view as well, and saved a bit of money in the process! Suggestion to the Wyndham Management: If a guest calls down with a problem such as ants, even once, send them something to their room (ie. bottle of rum, fruit, etc.) to show that you care enough to acknowledge that there was an issue... It's a small gesture, but goes a long way. Problems occur with all properties here and there, but it is how you handle it that shows the guest that you value their business. You also never know when you will have a guest traveling with their family that also happens to represent many international corporations looking for locations to hold meetings/conferences outside the continental US. ;o)", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Katy, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but would definitely go somewhere else next time\u201d", "Author": "larguita", "ReviewID": "UR116039719", "Content": "Tips: Rent a car, buy groceries/snacks at Walmart, get pool towels early since they will run out!

So if you have never been to a luxury resort, then how do you compare? With that being said, Rio Mar is NOT a luxury hotel. We were at this hotel from July 25th-July 29th 2011. We arrived to a so-so welcome from Dragonfly Travel. Our name was not on the transportation list, thank goodness that I brought all of my travel documents. We arrive at the hotel for another so-so welcome. The front desk called our room to make sure everything was ok, and thats where the \"good\" customer service stopped. We went out to the beach, and they were out of towels. They were also out of umbrellas. One of the guys at the beach said that the hotel was at full capacity, but there were so few umbrellas available. The guys on the beach were in no rush to make sure we got what we wanted. We went to the tours desk which was run by Dragonfly. Please believe everything negative that you read about them. So, if you want to book an excursion through them, you can do that ONLY of it is one of the excursions that their company is in charge of. For instance, we wanted to do the bio-bay tour. Because it isnt one of their tours it was a mess. We signed up for a total of three slots and didnt get any of them. Four people have to sign up, and after that, the company has to have availability. Unfortunately, Dragonfly is not high on the priority list. All three were canceled. They did call us afterward to tell us there was availability but we had to find our own transportation. When I asked what transportation options were, they didnt know. I was so frustrated because doing that really screws up your schedule. It was so hard to plan. I decided to rent a car and contact Pure Adventures and do it myself. Dragonfly charged $99 per person for this tour. Our rental car was $60, and the tour was $45 dollars per person. It was more economical to get our own car and make our own plans. PLUS we had a car for the day. Pure Adventures was GREAT!! The tour guides were great, and I loved Bio-Bay!! The only thing about PA, was that they dont provide transportation. Its worth getting a car. We gave our car back when we returned, to avoid paying $25 per night to park. Sometimes I felt like I was being scammed. For instance, we asked the concierge for a dinner recommendation. He recommended Hacienda something...I cant remember the second part of the place. Well he was sending everybody there saying how great it was. It was a 10 minute drive that the \"cab\" charged us $30 round trip for. Not only that, We shared a ride back, and he still charged us full price. When we got to the Hacienda, it smelled like horse crap!! COme to find out, this is where Dragonfly has the ATV, Horseback riding, and go carts. I was so disgusted, the food was average, and the service was terrible. When we got back I asked the concierge if they paid him to send people over there. He said in two years nobody has ever complained about the place being in the middle of a horse farm. Thats because most people arent honest to your face. We didnt eat at all of the eating establishments at the hotel. We did ERL, next to the casino, Palio, and Shima. ERL was good for breakfast and lunch. They had muffins, bagels, sandwiches etc. That was fine for eating during the day. Palio was really good. I had the asparagus risotto. Shima was disgusting. Really, the worse sushi I have ever had. SO bland!! How can sushi be bland with everything going on inside of the roll?? We were approached two separate times about 1) A secret, and 2) customer appreciation week. The secret was going to a time share presentation and getting a free massage. Customer appreciation week was the exact same thing, except that there was 3 days and 2 nights at a stateside hotel. It was all done in a tricky way. Overall, the hotel rooms look like a nicer Holiday Inn quality room. The service was definitely NOT UP TO PAR in comaprison to luxury hotels that I have been to. When I think of luxury, I think of The Ritz-Reynolds Plantation. Any hotel calling itself luxury should be up to that standard or better as far as I am concerned. If you have ever been there, then you have a point of reference. My room at Rio Mar was humid. Not to the point where it was unbearable, but enough for items to feel a little damp. For instance, my vitamins were damp the next morning.

Prices are ok for a resort. They have 4 restaurants (Palios, The Grill, Marbella and Shimas). The first two were not visited. Marbella, an international cuisine restaurant, offers breakfast buffet for $24 per person and Dinner Buffet for about $25 per person. Food is Great!! Shimas (Asian Bistro and Suchi Bar) has main course for around $25 per person. Mongolian Beef is a must. Facilities are in excellent conditions. The resort has two pools, one for adult and one for the whole family. The resort is also an Ocean Front Resort. Basically is a private sandy beach. It is a beautiful ocean front site, however there is a rough sea in the area. Hotel staff at the beach is always available to help you with all your needs. On the Other Side, I will strongly recommend to avoid the dates where the hotel is sold out. For example, my room supposed to be ready at 4 PM for check in, but it was ready a 6:30 PM. Due to enormous amount of people, we never get towels at the pool side at anytime during our stay. We bring the towels from the room.

The actual resort is located in Rio Grande (North East) part of PR. It is huge and surrounded by luch greenery. The beach and pool are very well maintained. Pool Area: 3 out of 5. The pool is great however the service stinks. The food served at the pool is mediocre at best and is WAY over priced. Drinks are ridiculously priced. I paid $8 plus tip for a Corona making it $9! The pool staff are vultures and snitches. If you take a few drinks (waters etc) in a backpack they'll threaten to kick you out of there. The rooms: 3 out of 5. The rooms are dated. The bathrooms are out dated too. When you stop out of the room, the carpet in the hallways is filthy. It looks like they've never washed it. Housekeeping service: 4 out of 5. In general they deliver towels quickly. Of the 7 days we were there they forgot to clean our room once. When notified they fixed attended to it quickly. Food: 2 out of 5: The price of food and drinks at the restaurant is ridiculous. Absolutely crazy! We've stated at numerous resorts all over the world and this one offered mediocre food at a crazy price. A beer can cost you around $10. Water Activities: 1 out of 5. Nearly every resort we've ever stayed at provides non motorized activities for free. At the resort they nickel and dime you for everything and none of it is included.

Parking sucks (self park)...plain and simple, i went the self park route and they just have no idea what their procedures are..one minute i have my cousin lift the gate, one minute they check my ticket the other they don't. My cousin and i stayed from Friday to Monday so is that 4 charged of $15 or is that 3 charges since we left on Monday?? of course i was charged 4 times but didn't balk at it since they didn't try to get me anywhere else. Nothing is close.....it's an almost 5 minute drive to the hotel once you get on to the property...then when we self park it's a hike usually from the outdoor parking lot since for some reason people go to that crappy casino and fill up the indoor parking. Make sure you go through the indoor parking to get a ticket...of which never really used. Again poor procedures. Hotel...the hotel itself like others have said needs an upgrade...the carpet in the west wing was old and smelly...RIP THAT CARPET UP. The rooms had no carpet so just take the carpet out of the hallway and be done with it. My ocean view was me needing to go out on to the balcony to see the ocean...for an extra 100 i say don't do it! Save the money. I will say the pool stays open 24 hours so that is a big plus...i never went to the kids side and from the noise didn't want too. The adult side is a tad boring though lol. I've been to DR and the hotels there put this one to complete shame especially when the DR hotels are all inclusive with jaquzzies. I mean the price per night at this hotel is terrible for what you get and that's not much... 10 bucks a night for a fridgerator..really? Just go to walgreens and get a foam cooler and ice, theres a walgreens every 10 feet. Use your cell phone for internet since you are still in the US as Rio charges for internet in your room, free in common areas. Beach...no thanks..water felt great but the sand bar is at least 40 feet out so that means murky brown water for about 40 feet...scared the willys out of me but i still got in it. My cousin and i spent most of our beach time at Carolina beach by the airport..that beach and water was 10 times better than Rio Mar's beach. Though theres nothing they can do about it so i don't hold it against them. However the price per night should reflect the crappy beach. Food...first of all thank you trip advisor and thank you all who reviewed before me...didn't even go near the hotel bar or resturants..actually i didn't even see them. Drive out of the hotel and right BEFORE your turn on to route 3 turn left into the parking lot where ISHMAR (spell) Bakery is...reviewers got it right. The young lady taking orders could have smiled a little more..and the people who came behind us got served before we did...4 people got served before us 2 people did so it could be some kind of local thing where the outsiders have to wait...don't get bent out of shape over it, just wait and you will be enjoying your food. What ever you do get the strawberry or cherry filled donut...yo it was off the chain! even better than Kracky Kreme. We never made it to the Kiosks which is a Right on 3 from Rio Mar and about 5-10 min away on the left side of the road, you can't miss them. We went to the famous Lechonera Los Pinos...that's route 52 to route 184, once you get on 184 you can't miss it, it's a bit of a drive but worth it. From the airport 26 east to 66 east to 3 east there are tons of places to stop and eat on 3. When you get off 66 expressway east to route 3, turn left and you will find Walmart. There's also an outlet you pass at the 66 - 3 junction you can't miss it. El Yunque is a stone's throw away from Rio Mar which is a plus if you want to go there. My suggestion is IF YOU DONT WANT TO PAY 4 per person...just drive past the welcoming center and up the mountain...there you will see the hiking trails and parking spots....only one way up and one way back. On your way to the forest is the little town you see adverts for zip line and other things. I'll do zip line next time. Take my advice GO EARLY. like 6-7 am so you get prime photo ops..anything after that and it's crap picture time. bottom line, i'd rather stay close to Carolina beach save money and drive out to the El Yunque. Rio Mar is just not worth it unless your a golfer. Rio...rip up the carpet...free frigerators....more light in the main area...stop calling ocean view rooms ocean view rooms when it's view of ocean from room...fix the parking, guests should park free....free internet My next trip to PR, i'm staying at cheap hotel and spend my cash on beach and food.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puyallup, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, pools, beach access, but lacked food options and was pricey.\u201d", "Author": "Tiffany830", "ReviewID": "UR115388781", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights at the Rio Mar after a cruise.

Recommend having your taxi driver stop @Walmart or Walgreen's for a cooler, snacks and drinks. Highly recommend setting up excursions well in advance - so much for spontaneity on vacation - they fill up quickly and then you're on your own (even during off-peak season)! Car would be cost-effective if doing more than one excursion - taxis are a lot to get to these. Wyndham pushes their own excursions with \"DragonFly\" and are not very helpful with other adventures. Tried hard to get on a Biobay excursion but one concierge in particular told me there were no other companies then she proceeded to give me the hard sell for The Vacation Club.

A group of 5 of us (all in our mid 20's) decided to vacation together and we got a great deal through travelocity. None of us had ever been to Puerto Rico before, so we didn't know what to expect. We did our homework on the property before we got there, so we budgeted in valet parking into our stay. The drive in from the airport did take a little while, but it wasn't bad, and it gave us a chance to experience a little of real Puerto Rico. I would strongly recommend renting a vehicle, not just because it is so far away, but because it gives you a chance to explore the island. We went to El Yunque one day, Bioiluminescent bay another, and into Old San Juan on a third. The location of the resort is amazing for exploring the Island's high points. It is right next to El Yunque so you get this great combination of lush tropical rainforrest mixed with beachfront views the entire time you are there. We had booked 3 mountain view rooms (the cheaper option) but when we got there they only had 2, so they upgraded one of the rooms to an ocean view for free. The mountain view rooms are great too, leave the door opened a crack and you can either go to sleep to the sound of waves crashing or to the sound of wildlife and wind blowing through the trees. The hotel is a little dated, but everything is kept very clean. We had some trouble with our key getting our hotel room door open, and the staff was always helpful in tending to our request as soon as possible. We made friends with the valet on the first day, and asked for their imput on where to eat. They recommended a place they go out to drink after work (and we even followed them there after their shift was done.) I wish I could remember the name, the food was AMAZING, the marinated skirt steak was one of the best I have ever eaten. We ate on site at the retaurants twice and ordered room service once. The food there is good, but it is expensive (especially compared to how good and how cheap the authentic Puerto-Rican food is around there. The beach is a little choppy, but enjoyable, and the pools are amazing (especially at night.) The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable. The one thing I would advise is that timing seems to be everything at this place. We went during the week before school was out, we came on Sunday and left on Saturday. We really wanted a nice quiet place to relax (some people may deem it as \"boring\") if you are looking for a place to rest with a group of friends that you come with then it is great. The last night we were there, school had just let out and the place got crowded FAST. So if you really want a lot of people there to meet and mingle with, then make sure you go on a weekend in June-August.

You'll be greeted with a nice lake with El Yunque in the background. Great for photo's. The hotel is pretty well designed except to get to the main dining area. It's 30 minutes from San Juan and 30 minutes from Farjado where you can get snorkeling or kayak to Bio Bay. Although we rented a car ahead of time, there's an Enterprise in the hotel if you want to travel yourself. The hotel offers buses to various activities but have limited seating. Food is expensive here so if you don't rent a car you're pretty much stuck with what they have as the grounds are pretty far from any other places to eat. Unless you're ready to do some walking, a pretty long walk. Since we had free breakfast for 2, we only ate breakfast at the hotel. We also ate dinner on the first night. Breakfast was ok except the last day. They must have had another cook cause the eggs weren't as fluffy nor tasty as the previous days we ate there. We ate at various areas through out our vacation. There's a nice small restaurant call Tio Pepe's on the right on route 3 not too far from the road leading to the hotel that was pretty good with great prices. The hotel has a small casino that gets crowded in the evening starting Wednesdays. If you park in the lot and come in by 8pm, expect to start searching for spaces as there's not a lot of spots. It'll empty out later in the evening. Parking is $15 a day or $20 for valet. The hotel has two pools, one for adults and the other for children. We had no issues staying in the pool after hours.

After numerous calls explaining to them they were part of a group and that being moved is not an option, the resort relents and tells them they \"found a room for them.\" How nice. I thought that's what reservations were for. Just to be safe, the other two couples call and confirm their reservations with the hotel, telling them we are all coming and we'll be there in a n hour.

We suggest canceling all of our rooms and heading back into San Juan, but the woman behind the counter tells us that all of San Juan is sold out and that we'll never get a room, much less three. I called Marriott from the desk of the Wyndham and they tell me they can accommodate us in any of their San Juan resorts. Upon hearing this, they suddenly find a room for the put out couple.

The airconditioning worked and kept the temperature bearable, but through either a fault or poor design could not keep the humidity at bay. Our room felt like a cold sauna. Our clothes were damp every morning, the sheets were clammy at night. I am surprised other reviewers did not remark on this, but based on the stains on the walls - this has been going on for a while. We simply did not experience the calm and relaxation we came to this island to find. The rest of the room was also sub-par for a resort (4 star, Grand-status). The bathroom looked like a Holiday Inn and the only touch of 'class' was the LG flat screen. Nothing else about this came close to some of the other caribean resorts (Windjammer or Excellence to name a few favorites) we've been to. It felt like an old three star business hotel states-side. The prices were fairly ridiculous as well, and they certainly did not provide the value in either quality or (especially) service. Staff was fairly rude, slow to respond, etc. The last day we waited 40 minutes to get our car out of the valet. It was not busy, but for whatever magical reason with 4 valets standing around no one was picking up the ticket until the third time I went and talked to the person behind the desk. Food was unremarkable as well. To be fair - we did not try Palio which everyone seems to like. Mirabella has a Flamenco performance every first Friday of each month.

The view was OK - We were in a section of the hotel that sits back from another section, so the ocean view was greatly blocked by another section of the hotel. It was technically ocean front, but wasn't the view that I was expecting. The pool was great. There was an adult section - the chairs had cusions in the adult section. We liked the adult area because it was more quiet and peaceful for couples. Chairs and umbrellas were free at the beach. The water is not as clear here as it was in San Juan (Isla Verde Beach). I was surprised how long the beach streched. I like to run on the beach and I could run a long ways on this beach - the pictures don't adaquately show how streched out it is. I loved the water slide. It was so much fun (for adults too). I would skip the steak house at the country club. Our meal was over 200 dollars (incuding a bottle of wine) and the steak wasn't that great. We also were not impressed with Palio, the pasta place. For the price, the food was only so-so. The BEST place to eat is actually a place away from the hotel, called hacienda carribe bar and grill. Check with the concerege - we got a coupon for two free sangrias. They can also give you directions - it is about a 10 minute drive. It was one of the best meals we had while in Puerto Rico - they have mostly Puerto Rican type dishes. Don't be fooled when you pull up. My husband was like, \"where are we, a rodeo?\" The grounds are very horsey. However, the restuarant is very cute - a darkish romantic atmosphere that is just a little bit country (not too much though). Please stay when you pull up - you won't regret it.

The layout is a bit confusing as well as finding the entrance. Drinks and food were expensive but that was expected. The rooms were clean and the service was excellent. We had a pool/ocean view which was nice. The beach was a little dissapointing as I felt like it compared to beaches in the states. Not a clear turquiose color but more like a greyish brownish color. I was a little disapointed that they close down all the amentities at the beaches and pool area around 6pm. They close the bar, the slide and they start removing the beach chairs. I was actually asked to get off of a beach chair so they could put it away (VERY RUDE!). I agree with the previous post that there is not much to do in the area unless you plan on visiting the rainforest or taking a day trip to culebra or viesques islands. We did get a chance to visit the rainforest which is about a 7 min car ride away. Not as close as I had originally thought but still pretty close. Rent a car and do the tours yourself there is no reason to pay for someone to walk you around a rainforest. The concierge will provide you with directions and a nicely drawn out map of everything to see there. The tower and the waterfalls were the only thing I found worthwhile. The views of the mountains from the tower are breathtaking. I must mention that I had no problems with the valet as others said they did. I waited less than 5 minutes each time and that was without calling ahead. So in my opinion the valet is worth it. For food we tried the buffet at Marbellas, it wasnt horrible but nothing to write back home about either. Unfortunately Palio was closed for some reason but had an advertisement for a prix fix menu in the lobby that same night which I found rather odd. For breakfast we went to Antojitos which I thought was horrible. Maybe they are better for lunch and dinner but I didn't want to take a chance and go back. We also tried the kioskos for lunch one day, which were just okay as well. I would recommend the pizza shop there, everything else seemed a little risky but the pizza we had was actually pretty tasty. I would also recommend the little fruit smoothies from the truck there, best smoothie I ever had. The best meal we had the whole week we were in PR was at the Hacienda Carabali. The skirt steak and rice with beans is a must. Thanks Jorge for the recommendation! We spent the first half of our vacation in the Condado/Old San Juan area. Which I prefer over this area. There is alot more to do and the beaches there are better as well. Depending on what type of activities you want to do would determine where you should stay. If you prefer nightlife, shopping, and fine dining, go with Condado/Old San Juan.

Before we traveled I read probably 50+ reviews on trip advisor and think the advice given made the stay far better than it would have been if I hadn't. Like most people have mentioned in previous posts renting a car is a good idea if you expect to leave the resort($35 per day) . We spent most of our days off the resort exploring different beaches and participating in activities. By the way, we paid for valet parking ($25 per day) and we never had a problem waiting for our car as long as we called 15 minutes before taking off. The best thing we did while we were there was booked a day trip snorkeling out of Fajardo. We set the trip up with the tour specialist at the concierge desk and spent $140 combined for a catamaran trip that went from 10-4:30. The deal included a free lunch, free drinks and a chance to snorkel in the coral reef with the vibrant fish life! Did I mention free drinks?!? All the rum drinks you wanted for nothing. We bought one of those $10 underwater cameras from Walgreens and ended up with some amazing photos. We also spent a day in the El Yunque rainforest. This was one thing we both were really looking forward to. Although the rainforest was gorgeous, the crowds were so heavy that it made the experience unpleasant. When you get into the park there are \"trailhead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs. I would strongly suggest finding one more remote and with fewer cars parked in front! I wish I could have done it over again and heeded my own advice. The last day we were there we planned a trip to Old San Juan, unfortunately so did President Obama. There hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a sitting president visit Puerto Rico since the Kennedy administration and we managed to plan our time in old San Juan right during his 4 hour visit. It was frustrating but we could help but laugh at our misfortune. We powered through the traffic and managed to meal in the area before high tailing it out of there before they closed off all the streets in the area for security. It is a really cool area and we look forward to spending more time there when we come back again. While on the resort we really enjoyed swimming in the ocean at night under the full moon and lying on the beach. We found that the majority of guest preferred the pool areas. We found this to be unusual since we both grew up near beaches and feel very comfortable in saltwater, waves and sand. I have read several posts where people complained about the waves. They are at best 2-3 feet and by no means rough or scary. We unfortunately weren't one of the lucky ones to get and upgrade to a ocean view room but they put us on the 7th floor with mountain views and found it to be quite nice. The room was clean, quiet and we really enjoyed the private balconies that each unit has. Our room was equipped with a high end dehumidifier which helped provided a dry cool environment. It was sunny every day we were there and the temp was in the 90's with 90% humidity, so having a nice cool room feels great after a day in the heat. The grounds are beautiful and the staff was friendly enough. We went to Ralphs on our way in and bought the cooler many people suggested along with booze and snacks. We did enjoy having a few drinks at the tiki bar at the resort and occasionally ventured down at night for a nightcap Vincent the bartender (great guy!) However, for the most part we avoided the resort food and drink prices. The best food we had the entire trip was from La Estacion in Farjado. It's offers an outdoor dining climate near the El Conquistador resort. They serve bbq Caribbean cuisine that was amazing! Dinner and drinks ran us around $60 and everything was delicious, give it a shot!

There is an Amigo grocery store nearby, we actually went there, and bought some food and a cooler so we could at least eat breakfast without paying $17.

Perfect for just walking the beach, using the pool, sleeping in and reading and relaxing. We chose not to do any excursions as we just needed the sunshine and rest. That's exactly what we got!! To answer some of the questions I had before I came, here's my advice: You can NOT buy alcohol at duty free in the airport when you are incoming, only outgoing back to the US. We tried it and they asked to see our boarding passes. So when we got there, we split a cab with a couple we met on the shuttle to the resort and stopped at the mini-mart at the corner and stocked up on drinks and snacks and a styrofoam cooler. We brought big glasses from home so just made our own drinks for poolside. By the way, that couple was so cool that we hung out with them all week! That was a plus! While we had the cab, we ate at Isamar Bakery across from the mini-mart for breakfast and ordered cuban sandwiches to go for lunch. They are all that everyone said. The place is small and rather shabby, but the food was really good, large portions and inexpensive. I think if we went back, we would want to see more things so we would definitely rent a car at the airport and pay to keep it at the resort. I think the traffic from San Juan to Rio Grande was only moderately busy and anyone who is used to a larger-sized town/city traffic would not have any worries to try this. The restaurants at the resorts ARE a little pricey, but not any more than a nice restaurant in your area. We generally don't pay that much for eating out around home, but one day we split the taxi again with the other couple and went to Loquillo and the costs were the same as the resort plus the cost of the taxi. Also, the four of us were not impressed with what we ordered there. We wouldn't go back there. So we ate at the resort the rest of the time. We had a great lunch at the outdoor restaurant (not the tiki bar) which we didn't think was too expensive. We ate at Shima's, the Asian restaurant and really liked our meal there. We ate at the buffet in the main restaurant and didn't really like it there. I would generally order an appetizer and my husband would get a main dish to help the price stay down. We split another meal at lunch, so employed these methods to keep the price down. Our room was nice, the bed slept great and the bathroom was beautiful!! We used ice from the ice machine for our cooler. We turned on the air during the day and slept with the patio door open at night to hear the sounds of the waves. We had an ocean view/pool view room and it was good. Oh, and the tiki bar had happy hour at 5 every day with rum punch drinks for $2 if I remember right. They didn't advertise it AT ALL! We had to ask for it. The first day there we got 2 mojitos which were FABULOUS but they and a chips/dip tray cost about $20. But I really loved those mojitos! We were never bothered about a time share meeting and found ALL the staff members to be nothing but friendly and helpful. Sometimes I wonder if people who think the staff are rude and rude to them first. People usually respond to you by how you come across to them. So all in all, I would go back, but rent a car next time. The initial cost was really good thru Cheap Carribean.com and the shuttle with them ran very well and was easy to do. I was happy with their services as well. It's the third time I've booked a vacation through them.

CONS: pool bar and restaurants close early. Alcoholic drinks were expensive. Not many activities for night. Casino very small. TIPS: it gets dark early at PR. get an ice chest & snacks at Amigo Grocery to compensate for pool bar closing early and lobby bar serves some food.

So while we were irritated with the whole parking scene (paying for self as well as walking all over), since we knew what to expect, it didnt feel so bad. Here are some highlights: Pool - We were out most of the daytime so never used it then. We loved using the jacuzzi late at night as its open 24 hrs. Take your own towels and never worry about crowds Sea shore - its right outside and you can walk as far east or west as you like and its beautiful with the sea on one side and El yunque on the other. Food - We didnt even try to eat at the resort (coz of reviews here). We drove all around or got food to the room. And yes, Amigo or Ralphs are the best places to buy stuff but I got my chilled beer 2 at a time from the gas station :) Location - Its super close to En Yunque and short drives to several water activities in Fajardo.

When I talked with the hotel manager, they said if it is on the same floor they consider that close proximity. This is a very large resort, and this would not be considered close by anyone's normal standard. I was disappointed with the hotel's slow response in getting this resolved. By the second day, I think that the hotel redeemed their otherwise 1st bad impression. I agree that the food at the resort is expensive....that being said, I think the food in Puerto Rico is expensive! The kiosks at Luquillo beach were very reasonable. Otherwise, most of the restaurants that we were referred to had all the ambiance of a local diner. I think that the meals that were served should have been in the $8-$15 range, rather than the $25-$50 that were charged. Usually, when we stay at resorts we avoid eating at the resort because of the inflated prices, but in PR our experience was that the resort was one of the more reasonable places to eat with the bonus of air conditioning, tablecloths, and vegetables. The resort drinks were outrageous... $10.50 and small. Rooms were comfortable, resort was well kept, plenty of towels and beach chairs.

The grounds are impeccable, very well kept. It was rainy season in PR so we had a few days of rain. Also being so close to the rain forest a few hours of rain a day are expected. Obviously when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cloudy the waters look grayish but their blue splendor comes out with the sun. This is NO Jersey Shore!!! The iguanas are a big attraction. They are not afraid of people and people should not be afraid of them. I did not see an iguana eat someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food or scare someone. I did see one take a dip in the adult pool and of course everyone got out of the pool; within seconds someone from animal control was there to remove it. I read other reviews and trust me these iguanas are not out to get you. I would definitely recommend this hotel for vacation or business meetings. Our event planner was outstanding; very accommodating and always on top of every detail. The food at the event was delicious. Everyone at our event had a great time.

Couple things I'd like to point out: The reviews on this sight absolutely made the experience better. Knowing what to expect made all the difference in the world, specifically as it relates to the Resort proximity to other areas, the cost of parking etc. That said, I do completely disagree with some of the negative reviews. One of the main complains is the service and the cost of food. I found the service to be outstanding. Everyone was extremely helpfull, friendly and knowledgeable without being overbearing. On our 2nd to last day at the resort, we had brunch at the hotel. The breakfast prices were a little high, but not absurd. Brunch price on the menu was approx $24/person on I believe. Our waiter, simply offered to \"take care of us\" and gave us a steep discount from the advertised prices (and I do mean STEEP). Not sure how that qualifies as bad service. We did dinner one night at another of the restraunts. Our Bill came out to just under $100 for two, but that including me purchasing one of the more expensive entree's on the menus (approx $35), bottled Water, Wine and desert. The service was exceptional, and the prices were about what one would expect from an evening restraunt. I'd say the menu included Entree's from $15-40. Price wise, it wasnt Chili's but its not Ruth's Chris either. The Resort itself is immense. Upon entering the gate, it took probably another 5 minutes of driving to actually get to the main building. The Overall layout was attractive, and though the exterior of the bulding could possibly use a little TLC, I found the resort as a whole to be very inviting, elegantly decorated in an appealing spanish mediterranian style. Our room itself was large, with a comfortable king sized bed, sizeable bathroom with a large tub, two showers (stand alone, and one in the tub) and two sinks. There is even a scale provided, and the toilet is closed off from the rest of the bathroom. If I had to venture a guess, Id say the bathroom was approx 10x18 Our view wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great. We were on the lowest level facing the pool, but not a big deal, since we were only in the room to sleep. Based on the location of some of the other rooms, they looked to have had some decent views. One slight drawback is that the elevator from the parking area broken for a few hours, and the lobby area of the hotel is generally pretty cold, which can be rough when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming in from water activities. Definitely get a car. The Resort is fairly isolated, with no real night life in the immediate vicinity. Again, knowing this going in, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it to be an issue. Parking Is $15, and they charge you when you check out, but we somehow ended up paying for only two days of parking despite being there 4 nights. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll want to have the freedom to go to the store, restraunts, or on any excursions without having to be on the hotel shuttle schedule. Its also simple enough to get into San Juan where there is more hustle and bustle. We rented a car near the airport and drove. It was a fairly easy drive (once we figured out where we were going) Route 26 to Route 3, took approx 30 mins one way. Traffic is a non-issue, and aside from the fact that there are virtually no street signs (to indicate the name of the roads), getting around is fairly simple. The location is great if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to embark on some of the outdoor excursions PR has to offer. Its 5-10 mins from Fajardo, where they have a Bio Bay Tour (a MUST see), and a port where there are shuttles to Culebra island, Vieques, St Thomas etc. If you are planning to enjoy any of the excursions, make SURE you book them yourself with the companies individually. As it will literally cost you TWICE as much to book through the Hotel. We did the Bio Bay kayak tour for approx $40/person through Pure Adventure. I believe its $75/person through the resort. This trip is a breath taking experience that is a must see for any outdoor enthusiast. Pure Adventure did a great job by providing instructions, directions, food and beverages etc. We took a day trip to Culebra where we went snorkeling, and then spent time on Flamenco Beach. East Wind was the company we used and again great job and great trip. We took a Catamaran to one side of Culebra to snorkel for about an hour or so. The Coral was alive with fish, and though it was slightly overcast, the water was so remarkably clear it allowed for excellent views. Then took us over to Flamenco Beach which is rated one of the most attractive beaches in the world. It did not disappoint. We swam to shore, hung out for about two hours here. East winds serves snacks, unlimited drinks including rum, a very good lunch bar, fruit etc. They also provide snorkeling equipment if necessary. A great trip for just under $100/person. The resort was slightly more expensive @ $115/person We also did the ATV tour through the Forest. This was a good time, but was cut a little short by flash flood concerns. It was raining on this trip, though it only heightened the experience to me. I believe we paid something like $80 for the driver and it was $40 for a passenger. Resort Prices are $111 per driver and $195 for driver/passenger Overall, a great experience that I would recommend to everyone. I was somewhat disappointed by the fact that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run into any Iguanas. I was looking forward to the encounter. I did see one, but he was just making his way off the road on our way up to the hotel.

It was a little ways from the airport, and getting directions in Puerto Rico without a GPS device is daunting at first. But it's very easy to find the resort once you figure out how to navigate the PR roads. The room was fantastic. It looked almost like a bachelor apartment instead of a resort room. It was very spacious, very well decorated, and had a very open floorplan design. It had two closets, two sinks in the bathroom, two showers and one bathtub, and a secluded toilet area. The walls were thick enough to keep out most of the noise from other guests and the \"coqui\" frogs that chirp all night long. The pools were great and spacious. There were two in all: one for children and another for adults. The beach was close to the resort (short walk) and very clean. It had very soft sand; and even though it was on the Atlantic side, the waves were small and the water was warm. There were also many palm trees and other foliage that afforded great tropical scenery for anyone who decided to spend time on the beach. The interior of the resort itself was extremely attractive, with a modern mediterranean design. There were large windows that provided great views of the beach, and numerous spacious foyers for guests to lounge around in. The employees were very friendly and helpful, without making it obvious they were fishing for tips. Prices in the restaurants were comparable or tantamount to prices in such American restaurants as: Chiles, Sizzlers, or Elephant Bar. As with any restaurant trip, you spend what you want to spend and don't blame the resulting bill on restaurant prices. I was even impressed with the prices at the gift shop, whereas they were very reasonable! I was prepared to be bombarded with iguanas, yet I only saw one crossing the road near the entrance of the resort upon our arrival. In all, there were not many animals in sight at the whole resort! I loved hearing the coqui frogs chirp every night in the jungle forest adjacent to the resort. The sights and sounds were beautiful. The resort is located in the perfect location to do many tourist activities. The concierge desk is very helpful in giving good directions to the attraction locations. The resort is also close to many shopping areas with popular stores such as: Walmart, Walgreens, Marshalls, and local grocery stores. Popular fast food restaurants also reign abundant nearby the resort. We decided to have a romantic dinner in one of the restaurants one night and the restaurant staff were phenomenal. They were very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. And most importantly, the food was delicious. The next morning, we decided to get brunch at the resort and the manager welcomed us and offered a discount on the pricey breakfast buffet! He gave us an 80% discount and I gave him a HUGE tip (smile). Parking is very easy to do at the resort, and we ended up only paying for two days even though we parked for four. The only \"glitch\" was that the parking garage elevator was broken one day and we had to walk through the employee entrance and around the resort to get to our room.

It is apparently rainy season so it rained every day but we were still able to get a couple hours at the beach or pool each day. The property is well kept and beautiful. The rooms were very clean although the drawers in the room were a little musty as other reviewers had mentioned. This resort is VERY expensive. I took the advice of others and we took a taxi to Amigos Supermarket (do not go to the mini mart on the corner as the selection is not very good and they raised their prices as well) and bought water/wine/alcohol as well as snacks/fruit. The $10 per day refrigerator rental fee at the resort is well worth it since it comes to about $15/drink at the bar. They didn't seem to care if you brought your own to the pool or beach either, however, we didn't advertise it as we did it. My main complaint as to why I would never come back is that it is advertised that there are all these restaurants at the resort you can eat at and lots of excursions you can take which is the main part of the vacation. We were told that there was low occupancy and they had one maybe two restaurants open per day which to me, is not acceptable. Marbellas was always open but the breakfast buffet (which is expensive but very good) was only open a couple days the entire week due to low occupancy so you had to order off the menu which was not as economical as the buffet if you were hungry. We got tired of eating the same food every day (had enough burgers and turkey clubs to last me a long time) so we did take a taxi to Guavas, a restaurant which was a $15 cab ride each way, which was good (not great) but ends up being expensive after $30 plus tip rides to get there and back. In addition, the service at all the restaurants was very slow (they even forgot to put our order in at the lobby bar and it wasn't even busy) but since there wasn't much to do here, we weren't in a rush. As for the excursions, we were so excited to take the catamaran sailing/snorkeling trip as well as the sunset sailing cruise, however, neither were running all week since they needed 6 people for the catamaran and 4 people for the sailing cruise and apparently it was just the two of us that wanted to go. You would think they would try to accomodate their guests and if they are advertising that there are all these restaurants and excursions, they would make sure they are available to everyone regardless of occupancy. I did not get a price break and paid their expensive fees since I thought I was getting easy access to all the things they advertise they have. All in all, we do not feel the money we spent on this vacation was worth it and we would not recommend it nor plan on going back. I have spent half the amount of money going to all inclusive resorts that were amazing with lots of things do to in the Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos, and Antigua.

I had read people's reviews about things like: it's too far from san juan, etc. but figured it would work for us, as we were planning to do things in the Fajardo area also and would be renting a car. When we got to the hotel (yes, it was pretty far...45 minutes from the airport), we were pleasantly surprised by the surroundings...very tropical. We opted for the valet parking. It was pretty expensive, something like 25 or 28 dollars a day and they would charge it all when we checked out. For the most part, it was nice, but there were a couple of issues. The first was when we were leaving in the morning to make a tour, the woman totally ignored us for 5-10 minutes while I was standing right in front of here with my ticket in plain sight. She was on the phone and even though she saw me standing there, she totally ignored me. Then, a guy walked right in front of me and handed his ticket right to her and she took it! I made a comment but she just took my ticket also, right then and ignored what I said. We got our car before them, at least..otherwise, I would have really said something! On our last night, when we drove back up to the valet, there was no one even there for ten minutes. There were two other people and everyone was looking around for the valet. Finally, the guy came out. For what they charge for parking, they should definitely have better service. We ate in the Marbella restaurant three times and all three times, it was really good. Yes, the food isn't cheap, but what resort has cheap food? (also, In my great deal from hotels.com, I was given a $100 f&b credit, which they took out when we checked out...sweet!) Our room was decent and we had a great view over the pool, with the beach in the background. Late at night, they were some loud people in the halls a couple of nights, but it wasn't such a big deal.

Food/drink: Common complaint was the high price of cocktails - and they were ridiculously high at $10.50 a pop. But they were tasty. We ate at a few of the restaurants and they were all very good. Spendy, but delicious. On our 2nd day we decided to pay the $30 to have a cab take us to the grocery so we could get snacks, light meals and cocktail makings. We probably saved $200-$300 doing that as it lasted through the week. We had a soft travel cooler and just filled with ice daily. The store, Amigo, also had styrofoam coolers to buy. Also, if you are not a fan of Walmart, Amigo is a Walmart store but we didn't know that going in. Rent-a-car: They have Enterprise on site, but book it online for significant savings. I think it's the 6000 rio mar blvd address. We rented for 1 day to hike El Yunque and tour Old San Juan which was perfect. I was told conflicting details about whether or not parking was free for rental car and I think it was. Other: There are some activities during the day but we didn't participate.

I booked at this hotel because of the location- the proximity to San Juan, the rainforest, and Fajardo made it a convenient place to stay. I had read some bad reviews here, but was not at all disappointed with our stay there. This was our second time in Puerto Rico- the first time we stayed in San Juan, and I definitely had a better experience staying outside the city. Before I launch into my review, just a quick warning about the weather- the rainy season starts in May and it rains EVERY DAY. Don't believe what you hear- the rain really CAN ruin your vacation. We only had one day where we got rained out completely, but be ready for roughly half a day of rain on most days if you choose to come at this time. The upside is the prices are lower, the downside is as it is the off season, there are overall less services available. I second the prior opinions that a rental car is a MUST- both for mobility and cost. A one-way taxi from San Juan to Rio Grande is about $70. If you fly into San Juan, getting to the resort from the airport is quite easy and takes about 40 minutes if traffic is light to moderate. Driving in Puerto Rico is very comparable to driving in Miami- drivers are very inconsiderate, NEVER signal when changing lanes, and will cut you off when you think it's impossible for them to squeeze into your lane. But overall, if you are from a big city, it is not that stressful driving in PR. Roads are less well maintained and sometimes not well marked. It helps if you speak Spanish, as most of the road signs are only in Spanish. Now to the hotel. It is a little bit of a drive to get from the resort entrance to the actual hotel, but it is a pretty drive. Parking at the Rio Mar is $15/day for self-park and $20/day for valet. we did the self park, but the elevator from the parking garage was broken nearly all week, which made it a pain to get in and out of the hotel- in retrospect, we should have just done the valet. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the front desk staff and concierges, who can provide you with maps/directions for Old San Juan, El Yunque trails, and the Fajardo ferries, among others. We had an ocean view room - I have read other reviews about the view being obstructed with palm trees- we got lucky and got a 6th floor room with a great view of Rio Mar beach. Our room was clean and spacious. The bathroom looked like it had recently been remodeled, with marble countertops- the bathtub was a little outdated, but overall no complaints. The mattress and pillows were very comfortable. The walls are quite thin, so you can hear people running around in the halls, which can make it hard to sleep. There is no refrigerator in the room, which was quite frustrating. The hotel grounds are immaculately manicured. There are two beautiful pools, including an adults-only pool with a waterfall/grotto, and hot tub, as well as a Tiki bar and fire pit. There is also a children's wading pool, tennis courts, and golf courses (which we did not use). There is also a nice spa, and a fitness center which I used every day- they advertise it as 'state of the art'- I would argue that is not the case; there are 3 cross-trainers, 6 treadmills, a stairmaster, and a few weights. It got the job done, but certainly not cutting edge. It would be better if there were windows looking out onto the property, instead of mirrors lining the walls. Regarding the beach: This beach is on the Atlantic Ocean, not the Carribbean Sea, so the surf is more rough than on the south coast of the island. I am a girl who loves her coral island Caribbean beaches- soft, white sand and calm, turquoise water. Rio Mar beach has brown/golden sand (which is nice and soft), and the surf can be quite rough to the point of being dangerous, so it can be difficult to swim there- but I did get into body surfing! The beach is pretty much only accessible through the hotel, which is gated, so it is safe and not too crowded- in the mornings I was the only one on the beach at sunrise. There is essentially no trash and the beach is clean with minimal seaweed. The hotel provides beach lounge chairs and umbrellas, as well as towels, which is very nice. One very cool thing is that it is turtle nesting season in May through roughly August, and leatherback turtles lay their eggs on the beach. There were several roped-off areas where turtles had laid their eggs! The hotel is fairly isolated. There isn't much going on in Rio Grande; the closest movie theater is in Fajardo, which is about a 15 minute drive east. There is a Wallgreen's and a KFC down the street a couple miles, and in Fajardo there is a Wal-Mart and some chain restaurants like Pollo Tropical (a favorite of ours from our last trip to Miami). The resort has several restaurants, which are open on various days, some require reservations and others don't. We ate at the Tiki bar once- the food was prepared elsewhere and brought out to us in plastic containers, and was average and overpriced. I had a $10 alcoholic drink that was served in a plastic cup that couldn't have held more than 8 oz and barely had any alcohol in it! We ate twice at Marbella, which we liked because it was casual and did not require reservations. It again was overpriced, but the food was actually quite good. The restaurant situation is easily remedied by renting a car (at the airport, NOT at the hotel)- we ate most days either in San Juan, or at the Luquillo kiosks, which are located about 5 minutes' drive from the resort. We also bought non-perishable food at the grocery store and brought it back to the room. In terms of location, there is lots to do within a short drive of the resort. We spent 2 mornings hiking in El Yunque, drove to San Juan a couple of times, visited Luquillo and Fajardo, and took the ferry to both Vieques and Culebra. Finally- one highlight of the hotel for me was the wildlife. Due to the proximity to the rainforest, in addition to the soothing sounds of crashing surf at night, you will be treated to the melody of the signature critter of the area- the coqui frog, named for their Ko-KEE! call. It was wonderful to sit on the beach at night, look up at the stars, and listen to the frogs! In addition, there are all kinds of cool lizards and iguanas on the property- they especially come out on sunny days. Be careful not to hit them when driving! Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Rio Mar. We are definitely planning to come back to Puerto Rico, and we will definitely stay at the Rio Mar again.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Sandy1992", "ReviewID": "UR109985660", "Content": "I went to the Wyndham for a convention.

If you park your rental yourself it is $15 a day plus tax, valet is $20 a day plus tax. Valet is well worth it. We would call down from the room and give them our ticket number. The car was waiting for us everytime we left the hotel. Once we were in the room I noticed it wasn't the room I booked. We had reserved through Travelocity after I had called the hotel directly to confirm the difference between an ocean view and an ocean front. I was told the ocean view rooms were caddy corner to the beach and the ocean front directly faced the ocean. I specifically asked for an ocean front and paid extra for that room. This isn't the room we were given. We were given an ocean view suite, which was very nice but again, not what we booked. That evening we had dinner at Marabella inside the resort. The food was great (a little pricey for the portions, $28 for skirt steak & shrimp) and our waiter Jose C. was the nicest person we met at the resort the entire time we were there. This was also our first taste of Mofongo, which my husband loved.....me not so much. The next day we traveled to the rain forrest, the entrance is accross the highway from the resort. It drizzled on us the entire time we were up there but no worries, we had our swim suits on anyway. The waterfalls in the rainforrest are beautiful and it's free to guide yourself around. There are plenty of maps online you can print out. We had lunch at the Luguillo kiosks about 5 minutes away from the resort. This quickly became my favorite place to eat. Traditional food and a great price! We also had dinner at Richie's while we were there. If you go past the entrance to the resort about half a mile up the hill Richie's will be on the right hand side with the parking on the left hand side. This restaurant overlooks Rio Mar and the beach, the view is fabulous and so is the food. If your a kitty lover you'll also like their resident mascot, a sweet kitty that walks around their patio but never jumps on anyone or the tables. We also took a trip through Rio Mar's casino. Long story short I walked in with $20 and my husband $25. I walked out with $50 and my husband $5. We aren't big gamblers so this was some cheap fun to pass the time while it was raining. The pools, beach, and hot tub are all great, no problems finding seating or extra towels. Every morning at 10 AM near the activities pool they fed the iguanas. If you were on the beach at 5 PM your chair was taken from you to make way for the leatherback turtles. On a few of the restaurants they say that slacks are required, however when we ate at Shimas there were many people in nice shorts and shirts. Don't miss Island Adventures Bio Bay tour! It was amazing and only 30 minute drive from hotel. Only big complaint was the electrical outlets in the room where uncovered and had like 10 things plugged into each. Fire hazzard!!

I recommend booking a trip w/East Island Excursions for the bio-bay tour it was incredible & not to be missed. They are the only company that will take you over to Vieques & back on the same night..although planning your trip to give yourself a few days on Vieques island would be ideal bc it seemed nice there with lots to do. We also did the snorkleing trip to Culebra w/ East Island which was not the best bc the snorkeling part of it was poor- the reefs were not very vibrant at all and there were not many fish but the trip over to Flamenco beach was outstanding, the best beach I've ever seen.. a few days on that beach would be awesome too. However, if you don't have a lot of time to hotel hop.. then Rio Mar resort is a great place to be. The beach there was nice, the sand is nice, the water was fine, there are waves but it's definitely not unswimmable as some other reviews said. There are jet ski rentals right on the beach, the hotel pool is big & there's a separate pool for adults only. It is very true about the restaurants being very expensive at the hotel. Go to Ismar's bakery down the street on Route 3 & the road you turn into to get to the hotel they have great breakfast & lunch sandwiches for very cheap, you will be thankful you know about it instead paying a fortune at the resort. Also PePe's just a few buildings away from Ismar's on Route 3 had good cheap breakfast also. Antojito's restaurant behind Ismar's was good for dinner, get Mofongo. The Luquillo beach kiosks were ok, not awesome La Parilla was pretty good not incredible we had the Dorado (red snapper fried fish) it was tasty. You will absolutely need a rental car for sure. Don't try to do this trip without a rental car, don't rent at the hotel- too expensive, rent at the airport. Driving in PR is like driving in any city, wasn't a problem at all, didn't see any crazy drivers & the roads are paved & are totally fine.

Although driving to old san juan again to eat at some of the restaurants there would have been good but we didn't have the time, it's about an hour to OSJ from the hotel.

Wyndham Rio Mar. Very pretty hotel, both the lobby and the grounds, and family friendly. The pool is terrific and the beach is beautiful. Although the beach is public, you do not need to worry about vendors trying to sell you little items every 5 minutes. We did not see any of that. The Wyndham has staff who will set up chairs, tables and umbrellas for you on the beach. The hotel ran out of towels, chairs and umbrellas almost every day during the week of our visit. The key is to send one adult to the pool or the beach early in the morning to get towels and set up your family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairs and umbrellas. The adult can leave a beach bag or shoes on the chairs and go back and meet the family for breakfast. When you come out to the pool or beach after breakfast, you are all set. We strongly recommend that you rent a refrigerator for snacks and drinks. The Amigo supermarket is not far from the hotel, and you can pick up everything you need there (we also recommend that you rent a car \u00e2\u20ac\u201c see below). My big criticism of the hotel is that it did not honor its agreement to provide us with connecting rooms. I specifically contacted the property before making the reservation for two rooms and I was told connecting rooms would not be a problem. We also confirmed our reservation for connecting rooms before departure. Upon arrival we were told that there were no connecting rooms available. It took a lot of time and frustration as we spoke with one person after the next until hotel management would do something more than say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While management finally upgraded us to a suite for the first two nights, we still had to change rooms in the middle of our vacation in order to stay in the rooms we had booked. Restaurants: The food at the hotel is very, very expensive. We ate dinner at Palio (Italian) and The Grille Room (steak). The food was very good and both restaurants are kid-friendly, but also pricey! Bring a sweater to wear in the restaurants as it is quite chilly. We ate off-property at The Brass Cactus in Luquillo, which I highly recommend. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The hotel sent us to Guavas, also in Luquillo, but the food was mediocre at best and I do not recommend that restaurant. Car Rental: We strongly recommend that you rent a car so that you have your own transportation to and from excursions, restaurants and the airport. As noted above, you can also go the grocery store to pick up snacks and drinks to keep in the room. This should save you a lot of money. We rented through Alamo, and we had a good experience. Alamo advised that its car rental is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in terminal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You still need to take an Alamo shuttle with all of your luggage to get to the Alamo facility. As far as I could tell, you had to take a shuttle to get to any of the car rental facilities. We read reviews stating that GPS systems are unreliable, but that was not our experience. Our GPS system (rented with the car through Alamo) worked exceedingly well, getting us to the hotel, the airport, the excursions and the restaurants off property without any problem. I would still bring printed directions anytime you venture off the resort just to be safe. Bio Bay: We loved the Bio Bay kayak trip through Pure Adventure. There are usually two excursions each night, and we recommend doing the early excursion. This allows you to meet with the tour guide for the instruction during daylight. You also kayak out to the Bay during the daylight. It gets dark while you are in the Bay and it is pitch black as you kayak back to the base. By kayaking out to the Bay during the daylight, you have some familiarity with the route on your way back to the base. Pure Adventure was organized and ran on schedule. There is a discount when you pay cash. Horseback Riding: Our kids loved the horseback riding through Hacienda Caribali, which is very close to the hotel. The horses are gentle, and the kids were fine. It is worth paying extra for a reservation for a private 2-hour tour.

Overall, the hotel wasn't bad. I don't consider myself a picky person who looks at every small detail, but there are some details you cannot overlook no matter how hard you try: Valet parking is a rip-off. I had a horrible (without exaggeration) experience and I wasn't the only one. The Valet desk became more of customer complaint desk during our stay there. Guests would make the line to complaint about how the valet parking staff lost their car keys; one person ended up waiting for almost an hour for her car, I didn't quite reach the hour wait. My average wait time was about 40-45 minutes. I even insisted to the attendant to give me my keys and that I would get my car myself, but they refused. The supervisor on staff (Got his name initials - J.V.) saw my car keys were next in line after the 40 minute wait, but proceeded to help out a \"buddy\" instead for a few bucks slipped with the keys if you get my drift. I was disgusted at this and next time will do the self-parking as the $5 difference is simply not worth the headache. Parking is expensive as it is at $15-$20 per day. Good points about the hotel: The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are very clean; one restaurant Marbella was simply delicious and worth paying the marked up prices charged by the resort for food there. The Casino was just plain silly. Everyone went there to lose money. The cashier line was always empty and when we were there, they were raffling off a car, but everyone seemed to qualify for the finals. After a while, it was more entertaining to see people's faces as they left the casino than to actual go in it and lose money myself. Make sure to rent a frig for $10/night. It's worth it, trust me.

This facility is a bit pricey - a 12 oz can of coke cost $3.21 along with a bottle of water for almost $7.00 total. Then comes parking which is between 15 to 20 per day. Oh, and watch out for getting charged twice. They charged our room and got cash from my partner each day for parking until she realized and discussed with the hotel and they took the charges off our bill. At check out, I asked for a copy of the bill and they said...you don't get one because your balance is at zero and I insisted on getting a copy of it (so always get your copy because you just never know). The staff is completely approachable and very informative especially Wilson and Angelo (these two guys at the Concierge desk know everything there is to know about the island). It was close to El Yunque and to Fajardo where you can catch a ferry to get to the island of Culebra and Vieques (that should definitely be on your itinerary when you are there).

The service was amazing. Everyone was so nice to us and helpful. The Spanish is a little hard to get because they speak with a different accent, but I was able to communicate just fine (I'm speak conversational Spanish).

Over priced, yes, but not horrendous. Good experience at the kids club (and bad experience below), counselors were welcoming and warm. Negatives: Chair hogs (many families reserved large blocks of chairs at both pool and beach). Lack of beach towels after late morning. Easter Brunch in Mirabella was awful. The food was presented in a nice way, but obviously in a manner to prevent you from eating the pricey stuff (shrimp cocktail plated in a shot glass with one shrimp), and tasteless. There was a large group (500 plus) of families staying at hotel. Half the beach, several cabanas, all grassy fields, the conference center, and a large section of the lobby were blocked off for them. That meant the other hotels guests could not use them (at any time). While I understand this, it was very difficult to explain why my kids couldn't step foot in any of these areas, most of them not being used. We actually were scolded once for walking through of these areas by one of the friendly (not) group members. While we had planned two afternoons in the kids club, the 2nd never happened. As we went to check in, we were advised that it was full (we had reservations). When I said such I was then told it was closed. I had confirmed the day prior. After politely requesting the truth, we were told 'management' closed it when the large group asked for more babysitters at the last minute. The hotel advised no one and there were several angry non group guests. I understand that the large group is a $$ maker for the hotel, however everyone else's vacation suffered as a result. Very frustrating when most of the reserved areas were underused and the common/open areas were overrun with the group. Think this all could have been handled better.

That being said, I did not feel as though the hotel staff and facilities could handle the number of guests appropriately. 1. You could NOT get a beach chair, pool chaise, umbrella, or towel after 10AM--they were full/taken. Also, there was a huge party of guests that had reserved chairs that lay empty the everyday and could not be used by other guests--crazy! 2. Water pressure at peak times was non-existent. At 5PM I turned on our hot-water faucet and only air came out. 3. HUGE iguanas roam the property and pool areas, which is a blast for the kids, who enjoy feeding them. However, when they defecate around the pool and no one cleans it up for days, it can be a problem--I even mentioned the situation to two different staff members. On day three, someone addressed the messes. 4. There were no refrigerators available (when a bottle of water costs $7 dollars, it's nice to have a refrigerator). Guests must reserve or request a refrigerator in advance, but I think the hotel has very few. We were on a waiting list of 65 people who requested one and never got one. 5. Room WiFi will only work if it is hard-wired to your device via ethernet cable in the rooms (no phone or iPad usage in the rooms, you had to go to the lobby to get service). 6. The health club is tiny and was packed everyday--there were only seven treadmills for the hundreds and hundreds of guests. 7. I had never paid $24 for a salad served in a plastic container before until we arrived at the Rio Mar and had lunch by the pool on the first day. Drinks and salads for the four of us came to $162.00--ouch! 7. When anyone vacations during school vacation week, Easter, and Passover, there are going to be a lot of kids. Some families feel it is perfectly fine to let their kids play in the hallway running from room to room screaming and slamming doors. We asked to be moved to a different room, but our request was never addressed. We just left our room by 7:30 a.m. everyday to secure our beach chairs and towels. I don't mean to be overly negative about the hotel, but I felt we had to have our own system of coping to beat the madness of the numbers during peak holiday time. We made sure to arrive at the pool/beach/health club very early to secure chairs, towels, and services. We rented a car to drive around to shop and visit the rain forest (which is wonderful). We drove to Walgreens and Ralph's grocery store (about 2 miles west of the hotel on rte. 3) to purchase a cooler, waters, and drinks.

The pool others are describing as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckiddie pool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is actually a very large and nice pool with a waterslide.

At the poolside caf\u00c3\u00a9 (or whatever they call it) the food took a very long time, but they offered a round of free drinks (like 5 frozen drinks although 3 virgin for the kids) which was very nice. Fairly expensive but reasonable I felt for a resort. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcShimas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sushi/Asian restaurant in the hotel was excellent, and the deserts absolutely phenomenal.

Atmosphere was better than expected, but deep fry and add a lot of salt to anything and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be tasty. Appetizers are very good. Corn sticks are like corn bread hush puppies. Not much for healthy alternatives for the entr\u00c3\u00a9e menu. Mofongo was good, but not amazing. Terraza Montemar just up the street from Richies was a gem. Lunch type atmosphere with a terrific view, but a dinnerish menu. We arrived late so got a late lunch before checking into the hotel. Kids nuggets were great, and the seafood mofongo was my base of comparison for all others, which none else compared. They spoke little English, with a kid crying in a crib in a corner, but the food was great. Metropol in Fajardo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c interesting, Cuban.

Someone came and adjusted the thermostat plus provided us a de-humidifier for the room which helped. The beach is long with beautiful sand but unfortunately alot of garbage like cigarette butts, plastic cups, cellophane, paper, etc litter the beach.

The perfect weather helped make the stay even better, but the resort alone was lovely. It was easy to get to from the airport (about a 40 minute drive) and it was a great location for day trips to Fajardo, Las Croabas, Luquillo, and Seven Seas beach. Self parking was simple and it's well worth it to have a car and drive around to check out the Ceviche Hut in Luquillo and the Ocean View restaurant in Las Croabas. We had a rainforest view room which was amazing! Eduardo at the front desk was nice enough to put us on a higher floor (6th) and we loved the view. The room was clean, bright and modern. We also loved our housekeeping staff who were so friendly and welcoming. The pool was amazing, but a little cold at times. That's not a drawback when you're ready to be refreshed after a few hours on the beautiful beach. We never had a problem getting chairs on the beach or at the pool, though there are folks who get up early and put down towels (especially at the adult pool) so if you are particular about your seats, you'll want to do that. The only two things that went wrong was the valet attendants misplacing out keys the first night (so we self-parked from then on which was easy) and the cold wings that were delivered from room service. Hey, these things happen and in the bigger picture, weren't enough to bring all of the other positives down. The best things about the resort is that they were so cool about guests bring their own drinks to the pool/beach area. They don't have to do this and could force you to buy the $7-$11 drinks on site, but they don't. Amigo supermarket and walmart are nearby and you can pick up a disposable cooler and snacks/drinks to keep in your room. There's an ice machine on every floor.

Even the good reviews revealed many problematic areas. Let's begin with check-in. We had early check-in, we arrived at 1:30 and told the room would be ready after 4. We also booked an oceanfront room. When we complained about waiting so long for the room to be ready,they found us another. Fine,no view,it was obscured by palm trees.

On the first morning, I saw dirty windows illuminated by the sun. For the next 4 mornings, the same windows still had the same fingerprints. We had drink one night at the bar outside Palio. Want to see dirt? Look up At the shelves behind the bar. The service was incredibly slow,which appeared to be because they were understaffed. The gym was minuscule and out dated. We stayed at the resort 7 years ago when it was a Westin, and the gym was exactly the same. Also,dirty and ill equipped. We met many wonderful members of the staff.

The excursions through the hotel were a rip off and booked until the next week. The concierge told me the resort was 90% full,yet some of the restaurants were closed. When I asked what people did if they couldn't get reservations,he told me it was a problem-no kidding. The good news is,we left the hotel and had great meals at Hacienda, Pasta y Pueblo and the Kiosks. Our kayaking trip to the Bio Bay was awesome.

I was hesitant to go to Puerto Rico. I love Aruba but gave PR a shot. The island is very lush; not a desert like Aruba. The hotel was clean; up to date and very pretty. It is a 7 story hotel; with most restaurants on level one. Yes, they are expensive. Just know that going in. The two pools were always clean and never had a problem getting four chairs together at the activity pool. The adult pool could use more space; but we did opt for a cabana there and at the beach 3 out of the 4 days. It was a nice treat to be out of the direct sunlight all day long. Not an expensive for everyone; but we wanted to do it. The staff does ask about the timeshares; but just realize that is their job; and a simple no thanks ended each proposal.

The rooms are clean and spacious, with wonderful balcony views. The concierge staff gave us great recommendations and directions. The location is perfect for a lot of the local attractions. Of note, since it's near the rain forest, don't be surprised when it rains.....the rain usually passes in a few minutes.

The hotel will even give you cups of ice! Don't book excursions through the concierge. You can save a small fortune using different companies than Dragonfly.

We rented through Hertz at San Juan airport for $225/wk (with AAA). And although we had to pay for parking at Rio Mar it paid to have the flexibility of the car to go out for meals, do sightseeing and take trips out for supplies. There are some fabulous fun places to explore and eat around Rio Mar. We enjoyed dining close by at Don Pepes, Antonijitos, and Palmar Bakery (amazing chicken sandwich). El Verde Grill (W on 3 & 186) a roadside \"hole in the wall\" was recommendeded by friend who travels to PR often and it was wonderful $24 fed the 4 of us including drinks! La Parilla at Luquillo kiosks had yummy food when you finally receive it - we waited 1 1/2 hours for our food and found the service to be really lacking. El Yunque is a must have and another reason to have your own car. The tours through the hotel are over $100 per person and it is less than 10 minutes by car. Plus I can't imagine tour buses being able to get you to some of the locations we could go in the car. Be warned though the parking situation at the top will test your driving skills and nerves! If you want to zipline with your kids try Rainforest Zipline Corp. They are along the road into El Yunque and they are wonderful! Our 6 year old backed out after he got all suited up and they were nothing but accomodating to allow the rest of us to continue and still keep the 6 year old entertained. They even refunded our money for the 6 year old. Wonderful group of people! We also traveled to Old San Juan one day. The two \"forts\" are amazing and our teenager loved the Carmelo Anthony street ball court right outside of San Cristobal along the ocean. Old San Juan shops were too touristy for us and too crowded. Back to Rio Mar though - our kids really enjoyed it - the basketball court by the beach was a hit with the teenager, the beach was great and the beach service (chairs and umbrellas) was always available, the pool although beautiful was surprisingly cold and that meant a lot of people used the hot tub at the activity pool for swimming. We think it contributed to the fact that we all came home with strep! Feeding the iguanas was bit hit with our 6 year old. Rio Mar is a nice family resort however I wish there were more activities past 5 pm for families. Even the movie night and bonfire started at 5:30 pm most families are trying to get dinner and get cleaned up from a day at the pool by then. Also the towel cabana ran out of towels by 5:30 one day and you can't get towels after 6 pm anyway. If they are going to have a \"24 hour\" pool they need to have a way to get towels. The biggest \"con\" at Rio Mar is the price of food and drinks! $10.50 for a pina colada is a bit out of line. I can understand paying a premium price at a resort but $80 for lunch, drinks and 1 ice cream bar for myself and 2 kids one day was insane. We went to Amigos grocery store spent $60 and had bottled water, sports drinks, fruit, snacks and sandwich fixing for several days. Get the fridge from the hotel or a cheap cooler and you will save a lot of $$ - even if you just buy your own water and drinks. Bought a case of water for less than the cost of 1 bottle at the resort. Last but not least, stay on top of housekeeping. Our service went down hill each day we were there. 4 in our room and they begin taking all our towels but only leaving 2! Oh and hopefully you will get Tony R as your bellman - he is wonderful!

Overall : 3/5. Value thru Cheap Caribbean was excellent, 5/5. If a great deal can be had, you'll be enjoying a gorgeous property and any headache can be chalked up - \"Well, at least the price was great!\" Because we got such a great package price, I was willing to spend extra on renting a car. Value once on the property: poor to fair. Read on. Service at this property - 1/5. After our first interaction, though it sounds terrible, we did all we could to avoid having to interact with the friendly, but generally overworked, understaffed, and therefore sorely under-helpful staff out of a desire to protect our easygoing vacation-minded attitudes. Waited in line to check in about 20 minutes. 3 guests ahead of me with various complaints about their phones not working, their room keys being deactivated, and witnessed an argument between 2 frustrated parties touched-off by the length of the lines. Only 1 employee at the front desk, who had to continually disappear through the behind-the-desk area multiple times to meet each guests' request. Other employees appeared to be behind these closed doors, but if they came to the desk it was with eyes lowered, on-a-mission-to-staple-this-paper, don't-bother-me, can't-help-you. When we were finally checked in we had to ask specifically about the fitness center, pool towels, self-vs-valet parking, and the instructions we got were basic, but incomplete. For example, on our 2nd-to-last day, the self-parking garage attendant told us we had to have our ticket validated at the front desk. Now, no other garage attendant ever mentioned this, but we would've complied with this stipulation all along had we been properly instructed at check-in - or, based on our front desk experience, we probably would've coughed up another $5/night for valet. (Since it was almost time to check out, we ignored these instructions for the last 2 days and the attendants let us in and out with only a mild scolding each time until we left.) Bellhop service was the brightest of the trip, with the gentleman sharing tips for restaurants and bars off-property, even writing us a list of places to go on the room's notepad. Pool towels were always available, but only after standing in a line to be asked for your room number, # of towels requested, and given a wristband for a purpose I could never surmise. When there were 2 employees behind the desk service was even slower, as 1 person did all the talking and wristbanding, while the other stood idley with the pile of towels, \"handing\" you them from the pile stacked up directly in front of your face. The concierge gave us inadequate directions (a printout) to a local restaurant one night after standing in line for 15 minutes. We ended up turning around and going to a place we'd already been. We avoided bar service there as the drink prices were astronomical. Afraid to brave the front desk line again upon checkout, I was pleased to find our (correct) list of charges and directions for telephone, automated checkout upon waking up on our last day there. We left our room keys in the room and breathed a sigh of relief. Beach and Pools - 4.5/5. The grounds, and pool areas were manicured and elegant. Lovely water feature at the adult pool, comfortable deck chairs, and many more available then 'saved' chairs. Only the adult pool area had a shortage of available chairs at any given time, and if they would do away with the ridiculous cabanas (or at least disassemble them, with their \"reserved\" signs, after no one reserves them), there would've been more space. Docked because there was no attempt at heating the pool, which felt icy. Only a few guests braved the waters daily. The hot tubs were almost always in use, and were comfortable. The beach area, red-flagged each day, was spacious, mostly clean, and plenty of chairs. Umbrellas were brought out as guests asked for them, and tipped - perhaps paid - we didn't ask. Instead we pulled our chairs under the palms lining the edge of the beach. Lots of people playing in the waves and water despite the red flags. The beach and ocean were sandy, not rocky. Dining Options - 2/5, because there were options, but the prices prohibitive. Ate 1 meal there after a long day spent driving around the island and just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drag ourselves to the car for a dinner out. $80 for 1 app, 1 salad, 1 pasta entr\u00c3\u00a9e, 2 glasses wine, tip. Service slow but acceptable. Quality fine but the markups left a bad taste in your mouth. Breakfast kiosk at the hotel was especially laughable as we found a local bakery just down the hill (Palmers) and ate for less than $5 each day. Passing the kiosk with its posted prices always gave us a laugh as a pastry was $3.50 and we'd just eaten 2, a sandwich, and coffees for almost that mush. Beer (local Medalla, $2 at bars) priced at $6, cocktails $10, soda $3. Water in room $7. Burger $16. This is just silliness. Room Comfort and Cleanliness - 4/5 We paid for a mountainview room and were upgraded to a partial-oceanview. 4th floor, above the bar's patio so some smoke and talking in the evening but we were happy with the proximity of the waves. All rooms here have a balcony, and we spent lots of time on ours. No king rooms available, so we had 2 queens, which we were fine with. The beds, sheets, and pillows were comfortable. Air conditioning was adequate, we only ran it during the day, and at night we cracked the patio door. Unfortunately our sheer curtain was missing, and we weren't dealing with the front desk, so we just went with it. Bathroom and shower were spacious. Toilet ran, we jiggled the handle (button, rather) till it stopped. Water pressure fine unless the next-door neighbors were showering too, then it was not great. No fridge in room; instead a glaring empty space and a notation in the resort guide that they're available for $10 per day. We didn't pay for wi-fi or internet on principle; our iphones had to make do. English and Spanish channels on the TV, some with very poor reception. We eventually gave up on having housekeeping visit our room after 2 days passed without any service. Oh well, we thought, at least the room was cheap, and anyway we have enough towels. They did come on the 3rd day, and the 5th and 6th days. They did throw away our toothbrush case caps, and take our (cheap, Walmart) beach towels which we purchased to take to public beaches. They bore no resemblance to the resorts' pool towels but it was on our last full day there so oh well. I should mention that on day 2 my husband woke early and went to use the fitness center (he said adequate, with some broken treadmills etc). The carpeted hallway outside our room and all the way to the elevators was squishing with water underneath his feet. From what we can tell, the ice machine a few doors down had leaked overnight and the carpet was wet for days. On day 3 the smell in the hallway was unpleasant, by day 4 we took to running from the elevator to our room, holding our breath. Management placed a blower in the hall for 4 days, moving it periodically, but even when the carpet finally dried, the smell remained. Miraculously, our (tiled) room didn't take on the odor of the hallway, and though this was unpleasant, we ignored it as best we could. All in all, we enjoyed a lovely vacation despite some challenges. I intend to email Wyndam's corporate offices with some of our concerns as I believe this property's management does a disservice to their guests. The beautiful grounds and location makes for a confusing, inconsistent image when paired with such shabby service and nickel-and-dime atmosphere. Please consider some tips if you'll be staying at this property: Rent a car. Self parking is about $15 per day. Buy a styrofoam cooler for your room at a drugstore. Buy your drinks and whatever you'd like to have in the fridge. The wastebaskets, bag removed, make a terrific ice container to fill up the coolers. The bars sell Medalla Light cans, so we just brought our cold cans to the beach/pool. They frown on coolers at the pool and in the crowded beach area - so seclude yourself a little and enjoy your cold beer. Visit Palmer's Bakery for pastries, sandwiches, and coffee. Breakfasted here daily for $5 or less. Don Pepe's restaurant is the best for PR food (try the skirt steak!). Antojitos food wasn't great, but atmosphere wonderful at night and drinks delish (sangria and mojitos esp). Visit the kiosks at Luquillo Beach, esp El Jefe and La Parilla. Go on a sail/snorkel day with Erin go Bragh. Don't forget to drive to Old San Juan and wander through its magical streets on foot.

(They give you an ID card to use at all the hotel facilities & restaurantes while there) Rented a 1BR condo on the 4th floor after 2 disappointing days at a condo complex privately owned farther south in Yabucoa. (There were some serious issues with the accomodations but will not mention the place since they refunded us the remaining 4 nights...) While south in Yabucoa the first 2 days of our vacation we checked out the southern coastline which has some truly breathtaking views, but would overall not really recommend that part of the island if you are looking for nice and CLEAN beaches and things to do... (A lot of the areas/public beaches that are not under any resort type management are usually covered with trash and seaweed with homeless dogs running around and the beautiful looking ones can't be reached due to the mountain terrain...) We explored the coastline almost to Ponce in the south -dessert and brown mountains- and all the way up north to Rio Grande- lush & green. The Rio Mar resort in Rio Grande was by far the one we liked immediately! Had gotten the info from a real estate lady at the \"Marbella Resort\" in the east which we checked out, but did not like as much. The Rio Mar has a beautiful lush tropical landscape with a huge golf course, great upscale hotel with small casino and several restaurantes to eat at and a great clean beach with palm trees and chairs!! We paid $350 plus tax per night which is not cheap, but we were shown several units and had our pick which one we liked the best - was not very booked! All of them were wonderfully laid out with a cute kitchen with lots of dinner & glassware, W/D and nice furniture, balcony facing the beach 30 feet away and a really comfortable kind size bed- and security so one doesn't have to worry about the car getting stolen over night. (From what I understand most of the units are remodeled, but not all of them!) We hung out at Luquillo Beach 10 Min. down the road for the most part of the 4 days, which is truly one of the most beautiful beaches on the island! It is a State Park, meaning it has facilities, a kiosk to eat & buy food, is clean and park rangers patrol or are in range if need be. El Yunque Rain forest is also only 10 min. away and San Juan can be reached within 30-45 min. given the dense traffic everywhere. 'Seven beaches' a short trip to the east is also a nice visit since not too far, but is not as pretty as Luqillo Beach State Park. And \"the kiosks\" are just down the road. We will most definitely go back and book either through the real estate office or just show up and see what's available on Villas now that we know how things work. I guess another option would be to rent directly through VRBO from the owners, but the only issue is that if there's an emergency with the condo the owner is the contact, not the on-site real estate office- something to keep in mind! The resort is close to a lot of things, including supermarkets and plenty of other little local restaurants. Would recommend a car, unless you plan on staying at the resort the whole time, which is perfectly fine also. Great place to spend your vacation and long pretty beaches!! Wireless in condos, not for people who want to dive into 'night life' since more of a quiet resort for people who play golf or want to gamble at casino. San Juan not too far though.

One day they ran out of towels and the attendant excused himself to personally see to rectifying the problem within minutes. Grounds were immaculate and the beach clean with charis, umbrellas and little tables provided for guests. The casino is small, but has enough to keep you occupied. One recommendation would be to have a little more night life, as not much to do after dark, although sitting on the verandas reading or having a drink is very relaxing.

I do a lot of business travel so I am an \"observant\" guest. We chose the Rio Mar because we wanted to hang out and relax at a large place for several days, and not try to see the whole island. The property: The hotel building is Spanish style and gorgeous. Large spacious lobby with a beautiful view of the beach. The grounds are extensive and beautifully maintained. The two main pools are designated as one for adults only and one for families/activities. We loved the adult pool because it was quiet and peaceful all day without blaring music and kids running everywhere. Our room was large with 2 queen beds, tile floor, very clean. The bathroom was also very large with nice products from bath & bodyworks. We reserved an \"ocean view\" room, but if you really need to see the beach from your room, pay for an \"ocean front\" room. Our view was obscured by huge palm trees--not a big problem. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food: There are several restaurants on the property offering a nice variety of choices. Marbella (pronounced Maybella) is a big buffet and is open for three meals throughout the day. Dinner is a fixed $25. per person. We didn't have breakfast there, but it was also $25. per person--steep for a plate of eggs and fruit. Shima, the Japanese place was very nice--they did it right. The italian place call Palios is their highest-end dining experience. Entrees are $25-78. For the price, there was too much rushing around on the part of the wait staff and it was very noisy for a small place. The room is pretty, but the experience didn't match with the price tag. A basic margarita everywhere was $10.50. The 2 outdoor dining places, only open during the day, were fun--salads, burgers, and sandwiches --these two places were reasonable for lunch $9 and up. Overall, just be prepared to drop some money on food and drink. In my experience, there are no food deals in Caribbean resorts. Lots of people brought their own food and snacks to enjoy by the pool. The tap water is a-okay to drink. Bring your own water bottle to refill--you'll quickly get tired of buying water at $7. per bottle. Getting around: The hotel is about 40 minutes by shuttle bus east of the airport. We were very happy NOT to be staying in the concrete jungle of the larger hotel chains in San Juan. So once you get to the resort, it will cost you to get out and around. The Dragonfly transportation service will own you if you don't rent a car. We didn't. If I was traveling with the family I would strongly recommend renting a car. The hotel will charge you $15. per day for parking. The daytime excursions, run by Dragonfly, will cost $60-150 per person just to get to the places. The desk will call you cab, but many of the cabs don't have permits to get to places like the rain forest, so you will be dependent on Dragonfly. It's just how things go there. The Dragonfly shuttle buses are very modern and clean. Night life: The casino is fun and there was music over the weekend which we missed. Dinner is the main evening activity, and a stroll outdoors--nothing else goes on--no dancing or activities. Staying connected: The hotel offers 5 slow but free computers to check email--but 3 were down during our visit. Some of us had cell service, some didn't. Free wi-fi in the lobby, but if you want it in your room, it cost $40. per day. I heard this from a grumpy guest. Isn't the whole idea to unplug oneself?? We'd go back there again--they did it right.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cAverage Resort, Overpriced Ammenities\u201d", "Author": "dcquetpy", "ReviewID": "UR100651007", "Content": "In general, the property is nice and the staff is attentive.

It was not very difficult to drive down to the resort with the help of a GPS. GPS is a must in PR. Went to the resort and got the mountain-view room on 4th floor. Trees were blocking half the view. Room was decent with comfortable beds. Not having a fridge and microwave is a minus. We went to Walgreens and bought a cooler and being vegetarians we purchased some food and bought packaged meals from home. Didn't buy a thing at the resort for food. Only charges we had to pay were the parking fees, which is a rip off at $16 including taxes. We did the Bio Bay thru Pure Adventure. It was good not great as there was moonlight and the glow was not as bright as they show in the pictures. Still it was a new experience for us. We did snorkeling the next day thru East Island Excursions and they were good. They charged $49 for our 3-year-old to just come with us on the boat. That was kinda expensive for the kid. Went horseback riding thru Hacienda Carabali. Definitely recommend that. Isamar Bakery was great. They make good vege omelets and vege sandwiches.

Three particular incidents worth noting: 1) The creep by the pool who kept aggressively offering \"swim lessons\" to families with young girls. A young man in his early 20s named \"Cesar\" was lurking around the pool and jacuzzi area stalking families with very young girls (including us). Despite declining Cesar's offers multiple times, he continued to follow us around the pool area for over an hour. \u00c2\u00a0Cesar only targeted families with young girls (2-4 years old) and showed no interest in families with similarly aged boys. \u00c2\u00a0We reported the situation to the pool staff who dismissed our concerns by saying that Cesar had been \"coming here for years\" and that he was \"a sweetheart\". \u00c2\u00a0The harassment was so bad that we did not return to the pool area again during the rest of our stay. We reported the incident again at checkout and were advised that the situation would be reported to the manager.

Staff were unbelievably rude and obnoxious. For $87 my wife got the privilege of a pedicure that she waited 45 mins past her appointment time for next to a friend of a staff member who snorted noisily and rubbed her nose making disgusting sounds.

The technician never once introduced herself and barely even paid attention to the pedicure she was performing. 3) The reception staff were downright hostile.

Puerto Rico is a very interesting place. It has its goods and its bads and I'll tell you about both. Keep in mind that I speak fluent spanish and english and am very polite to people. The goods: The hotel grounds are beautiful. The pools are nice, they give you good quality fresh towels, and the food at the hotel is good. There are beaches that you can drive to which are not very close but are ok; Seven Seas Beach which is only a 25 minute drive, and Cabo Rojo which is a 2 hour drive. The El Yunque National Forest is across the street and is awesome to visit. Vieques island has some of the best beaches here, but since the ferrys don't allow rental cars to go, we stayed on the main island. The hotel management are friendly and curteous but not very helpful. A visit to Old San Juan is a must - the forts are a sight to see! And you'll be glad to know that there are Subway, McDonalds, and most other American fast food chains nearby. (you'll see why below). The bad: Oh, where to begin? If you booked with a discount travel website, like we did, you will most likely get shafted with a sub par room. Our room was said to be partial ocean view, but it really didn't offer a view of the ocean. If I stick my neck way out I can see a sliver of ocean. There is nothing really to do at night in the resort, except for gambling at the casino, or drinking, which will cost you about the same. The beach sucks. It's very windy, and there are biting bugs from 5pm on when the wind dies down. The surf is really strong and it's not pleasureable to swim unless you like to jump big waves which I love, but my kid was scared to death. Not a beach for kids. Our room was on the bottom floor and it was very humid and the air conditioning is stuck at 66f which makes the room into a deep freezer. Maybe that's why there's no fridge included. They charge you $15 per day for internet. $15 per day for self-parking. $15 per day as a resort fee even though this resort offers no activities or amenities that warrant this $15 fee. I thinks it's their way to offset the cost of towels that are constantly being stolen off the beach by local puerto rican kids and guests on a daily basis. Don't bother asking the staff to rationalize. Their excuses don't really make sense. Puerto Rico is one of the most expensive vacation spots I've ever been to, and I can't see why since the island is not that nice. They nickle and dime you for everything. The hotel is like a giant vaccum cleaner that sucks money out of your wallet. Read below to see how we got around this. The local puerto rican food is tasty, but extremely greasy, oily, starchy and heavy, which is hard on your system in hot weather. I couldn't handle it past the first day, and keep in mind that I am a professional chef and have enjoyed local food in many countries. The cost of food at the hotel is insane. As I'm writing this review, the idiot in the room above us decided to vomit his aftenoon drinks and lunch over his railing and all over our balcony, including my shorts which were drying on a chair. The hotel sent someone to clean it, and after we came back, the vomit was only half cleaned. The hotel management is unwilling to give us another room as they insists that the hotel is fully booked, which is a lie. There are 600 rooms and the parking lot is a third full. They are now sending someone to clean the rest of the vomit which I am going to have to supervise. Update: Cleaning person did not show up. I had to go up to the front desk and politely demanded in Spanish that someone come clean the rest of the vomit. Cleaning lady came to the room and got up in my wife's face. Wife called me on cell phone. I took the manager down to the room. The manager came and did it himself with the help of a groundskeeper. It seems the cleaning lady refused to do it. Joel the manager is probably the only helpful person in this hotel. He should probably get promoted to hotel manager so that things can run properly. I really commend him for helping us. In continuing this review, if you are still considering throwing your money away in this hotel, read my tips for saving money and salvaging your trip. Tips: Before you travel, buy a Puerto Rico edition of the Entertainment Book with coupons. As this has coupons that will give you 50% off the hotel's restaurants as well as many restaurants and activities all over Puerto Rico. But when you use the coupons in the hotel restaurants, order water to drink, as they will try to charge you a high amount for drinks in order to make up for the coupons. It also has a free upgrade coupon for enterprise car rental which you can use after booking your car rental online at a cheap price. Rent a car. There is nothing really to do at the resort, especially at night, and the beach sucks. So a car will be your only way to go to other places around the island without being herded into an expensive tour. It will also allow you to leave the resort to buy water, food, alcohol and groceries near by so that you don't have to take out a mortgage just to eat and drink. Unless you are a wealthy high roller, in which case you'd probably be in a nicer place. Expect that most puerto ricans that deal in commerce with visitors will try to squeeze you for every dime you're worth. So do things on your own rather than depend on vampires that feed off of tourists. This includes local restaurants, business owners, and tour guides. A little research on the internet and a rental car will allow you to enjoy most activities on your own. Don't pay the ridiculous fees for internet. Bring your smart phone and use that to check your emails, etc. This is a US territory and your cell phone will work here at no extra charge. Also, there is free WiFi at the hotel lobby which is not often advertised. To save money on the room you should book through a discount travel website which they probably won't let me mention here, all I can say is that you should name your own price. Overall, the best tip that I can give you is to avoid this island. There are much better islands in the caribbean. I could have stayed at a much better resort with superior beaches for a fraction of the cost in Florida. Or I could have gone all inclusive to a better island for less money, like turcs and caicos, aruba, dominican republic, virgin islands, st kitts, bermuda, margarita, the bahamas and the list goes on. This island is shabby and is a rip off. What enticed us to visit PR was the cheap airfare.

Renting a car at the airport is the way to go, yes parking cost money but the freedom to explore the island without paying for every little trip off the resort is priceless.The only fees we encountered other than parking was the hold they put on our card which turned out to be great cause we were able to eat, drink, and shop around the resort with ease. No extra charges or fees showed up on our final invoice. We also went off the resort for most of our meals, the Luquillo Kioskos make for some yummy and cheap local eats as do most of the little stands on the roadsides.

We did a lot of activities so the car was great. However, they charge you 15 dollars a day for self parking or 25 dollars for valet and it is completely unnecessary, the resort is huge with plenty of parking space so charging is something they do because they can. The food at the resort is not bad but it isn't worth the cost. We paid 60 for breakfast for two people and both dinners were about 100. Our best meals were the ones we ate off of the resort. If you head east on route 3 a couple miles down is a row of restaurants in Luquillo that are great, including La Parilla, it may look slightly run down but all of them sit right on the beach!

There aren't even activities for any of the kids, except an iguana feeding each day at 11 (once you've done it....) and bingo (which lasts 20 minutes) and a short slide for grade school aged kids. THAT IS IT!!! The beach does offer a few opportunities to jet ski but the ocean is SO choppy that it wasn't very popular. I never saw anyone go banana boating, nor did I see the boat that they would use, if you did sign up. There are windsurfing opportunities but I never saw anyone do that either. Basically, there are VERY LIMITED beach activities. Further up the beach is a mouth to a canal that heads into the island, and you can kayak on that, but heading to Bio Bay in the evening is a much better kayaking adventure. That I would highly recommend. We used the Island Adventures Bio Bay group (as there are several to choose) and they were terrific, start to finish. Try to pick a night with no moon - just spectacular and fun and memorable for all ages - elderly to little kids. Another big problem was the staff. While some were wonderful (the concierge desk in general), they are very UNACCOMODATING at the front desk and in their management staff. It started with a king bed instead of two doubles for me, and the next thing I know I am stuck accepting the king bed, and taking a pull out, with two tall boys 15 and 17. We all brought laptops or iPads to stay in touch, do a little work, but guess what ! (Internet service is $15.00 per day per device! I called El Conquistador and St. Regis and both are free, by the way.) It took us 2 days to get a refrigerator and we went to a local grocery store for drinks and provisions but had to keep icing them down. The two ice machines on my floor (6th) were broken all week except the last day, so I had to go to the 7th floor after discovering that the 5th floor ran out of ice all the time. The cash machine was not working in the hotel, and the line is very long for the buffet breakfast by 8:30 am, and on and on, but the management could not care less when I complained. The housekeeping staff were very accomodating however, a bright spot. I highly recommend renting a van or a car to visit adventures. The ATVing in the rainforest was a wonderful 3 hour excursion. I drove an ATV with my 15 year old on the back (no license) and we laughed and laughed throughout it, with all of the twists and turns, \"straitaways\" and bumps and beautiful scenery. Stopped at a river for a swim, jump off a rock and education which was unforgettable and so terrific. The guides were laughing right along with us - very nice people. We used Four Track Adventures in Rio Grande. They also have horses for a trek through the rainforest. We spent the afternoon walking through Old San Juan and then had a wonderful dinner at a small restaurant off the main square, and would highly recommend devoting at least 6-7 hours doing this. My teenagers enjoyed it and it was both educational, beautiful, and so very different from \"real life.\" Our final problem with the hotel is all of the \"extras\" that shouldn't be and the expensive pricing. I had about 10 pieces of sushi for dinner at over 30.00 (18.00 in my home town) and the prices in PALIO were jaw dropping, except for the spaghetti bolognese at 24.00, the cheapest thing on the menu !! I think you catch my drift. Unless you are two people who don't care about pricing, and just want a quiet time without kids by the adult pool, don't come here. But even two adults alone have a lot more choices, like LeSport in Antigua or several places in Turks and Caicos. I just don't get why anyone would come to this hotel with the other choices out there. This was mediocre at best in all categories.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed on Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "bjn115", "ReviewID": "UR99313064", "Content": "Overall, the hotel was beautiful. The beach and pools were great. Our experience with the customer service, however, was very disappointing. After having booked and paid for a shuttle from the airport, our shuttle driver met us without a shuttle. We waited an hour before getting a taxi. At the hotel front desk, we were told that they had overbooked and our only option would be a sofa bed in a \"half suite.\" No compensation/perks/free breakfast - anything was offered for this inconvenience. After insisting that this was unacceptable, we eventually got a room that was definitely not the \"honeymoon suite.\" The bed was comfortable and king size. the \"mountain view\" I'd reserved for this special occasion trip was instead a view of the valet parking garage. a pipe in our bathroom leaked and the floor was constantly wet, housekeeping took our old towels yet didn't leave us clean ones one day, and the noise between rooms was much more than I'd expected for a hotel that looked so nice. The restaurants were nice, we ate at the Marbella buffet every evening because it was such a great deal price-wise for what you get. However, service there was poor as well - we waited at least 15 minutes before being greeted, had to ask for a glas of water multiple times, and our order of cocktails was forgotten and we had to ask that it be taken off our bill later. The food was quite good though. The location of the resort was good, and Dragonfly Tours in the lobby ws quite helpful - they booked several tours for us.

I came with 3 other friends for my birthday celebration and we had two rooms on the same floor. To make things short and simple for everyone to read here is a list: -our bathroom wasn't very clean. some ladies long black hair was stuck to the walls. -the bathroom at times had some weird odor coming from the pipes behind the toilet. it smelled it the sewer. -everytime the house keeper came in to clean they never locked our balcony doors. we always leave it locked when we leave the room but everytime we came back it was unlocked. anyone could have came in our room from the balcony since we were on the first floor right where the entrance was to feed the iguanas. -we knew from reading other tripadvisor reviewers to rent a car and buy drinks at walmart. this was the best idea. thank goodness we did that. renting a fridge costs $10.00 extra a night. the food at marbella in the resort was a buffet at night for $25.00 but there wasn't much variety and the food didn't taste good at all. the steak was dry, ribs had a weird taste, chowder was salty, salad dressings were gross, rice was hard and the chicken tenders were too fried and burnt looking. the only ok thing to eat was the pasta alfredo. also the manager tried to charge us for taking the beers and soda that was with the buffet food. there was no sign of saying extra charge for drinks and no one was there stopping us from taking them. thanksfully our waiter told him it was there fault and he didn't charge us. -the location of the hotel was alright. close to the el yunque rainforest and the kioskos where they had many different restaurants but they all served basically the same bland tasting food. it was about 30 mins or so from san juan without traffic. we were stuck in traffic due to san juan's cooking gas pipe breaking and it took us about a hour or more to reach our destination. -beware the iguanas and lizards roam around freely on the resort grounds by the pool. it was hard for us to tan and lay by the pool. the huge iguana did a belly flop into the pool and we ran out. -the drinks were very expensive and were only mediocre. we had pina coladas, strawberry daquiries, peach freeze and mango slush. each at $8.00 a pop without tax or tip. -there were so many conventions going on here and no entertainment for the rest of the people staying except the casino which is very small and not very entertaining for those who don't want to gamble. there was a guy playing thr piano and a sax at the lobby bar but it wasn't great and it would have been nice to listen to some spanish music since we were in a spanish place. -they have free internet only in the internet section of the lobby but 2 out of the 5 computers were out of service and there a line to use them. -the phones in the room, cordless and non cordless were dirty. they need to clean that. the only thing good about this place was Ruben the bell man for helping us and the men that helped us with our beach chairs and umbrellas, setting them up nicely facing the sun. oh and the 1.5 hour late check out they gave us when we requested it since our flight was at 6pm. checkout for them is 11am", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilton, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cI wish I went somewhere else...\u201d", "Author": "winterbreak11", "ReviewID": "UR99262430", "Content": "Starting with the airport transfers (included in our package), they did not have our names on the list to pick up, but they did add our names and take us to the hotel, no questions asked. Then, we found the charge for $525 (party of 7) on our hotel bill. They took it off after we brought it to their attention. No apologies from them. We checked in to our rooms. We requested 2 ocean view rooms, each with 2 beds, adjoining. We received two rooms (not adjoining) on the 6th floor (West). One room had 2 beds overlooking the roof of their conference center and only a \"peek\" of the ocean if you craned your neck to the right off of our TINY balcony. The other room had only ONE king bed and a peek of the ocean from the same TINY balcony (for 3 people...). We spent the rest of the afternoon, waiting for a room that didn't look at a roof (still had the tiny balcony), and kept the King room and took a rollaway. Note: the majority of the rooms have a nice sized balcony, but the only rooms we were offerred had these tiny balconies and were tucked into the corners of the hotel. The rooms on the 6 & 7th floors are above the palm trees and have decent views. Ours was on the 4th floor and looked directly at a palm tree (6-10 from our balcony). Our room was also really close to the bar which had an outside area, a little noisy, but expected and wasn't a problem. Internet: Not free. We were told that if we became Wynham \"By Request\" members (free), we would receive free internet. Not true. Only true if we had booked directly with the hotel (we didn't). Also, at $15/day, PER COMPUTER in the same room, it was a huge RIPOFF!!! Our boys each had computers and so did I. $45/day?? Not us. Our biggest complaint about this hotel was that the staff had huge attitudes. They were never accomodating to our requests. (new rooms, charges on bills, forgotten food/drink orders, etc.) We were firm, but polite with our requests. Didn't matter,. It was clear that they received many complaints and knew how to handle them. We did not rent a car and instead went on the advice of other reviews and used taxis. (for us they were always vans -- party of 7). First day to Amigo grocery store. $40 (they wait for you - not a bad deal). Bought snacks, drinks, rum, milk, cereal and a styrofoam cooler. Saved lots of money. No coolers allowed at the pool -- no problem. First dinner off property, we went to La Parilla in Luquillo. Highly recommend. Asked for a taxi and when it was ready, our driver \"Israel\" took us to the restaurant and came back for us ($45?). This is where the trip turned sour! Israel asked us what we had been doing on the island since arriving and we told him some ideas we had. He then told us he could book an excursion for us to the \"Bio Bay.\" Ok, why not? We hadn't checked for available times ourselves, but the time he offered worked. He then told us he would pick us up and bring us back from Bio Bay. Price $225!! WHAT? After dinner we went directly to the hotel concierge (very helpful in every way) and inquired about renting a van for a few days and the cost. We were able to get a van for $95/day for 4 days total. Enough to do some activities outside of the hotel and still enough time to eat at the hotel restaurants as well. Early the next morning I called \"Israel\" and told him we did not need the taxi ride to Bio Bay. He was furious! He then told us he was not a taxi driver, but a tour operator that booked excursions for people. So, he made money driving us to our activities and he made a portion of money on the activity. Hmmmm. We had only asked for a taxi driver. This man called us several times on our cell phones and harrassed us! We apologized for his dissapointment and he eventually told my husband that we only felt he was a stupid \"racial slur.\" We were appalled. Never, did we say anything close to that. We spoke directly with the hotel manager on duty at that time and she was very sorry and promised to speak to him. PLEASE stay away from this man and be careful with the \"outside\" taxi drivers that the hotel brings in to supplement their needs. Now for the good times! Bio Bay -- a must (kayaking at night in a luminescent lagoon -- really cool!)$45/40cash) ATVing in the rain forest - another GREAT activity. Guides were fantastic & fun; wear crocs, not sneakers if you want to swim, it will be easier. ($75/driver, $45 passenger) Old San Juan - wonderful history & architecture. Spend a full afternoon here and then have dinner in one of the wonderful quaint restaurants. Zip Lines in Rain Forest - couldn't get a reservation, sold out. Book before you leave home. Hotel is nice. Rooms were fine, bathrooms were roomy. Not a five star property by any means. Food is expensive! Fruity drinks with alcohol $10.50, virgin $8.00. Gift shop prices on bottles of wine - insane. i.e. Santa Margharita $45.99/bottle A glass of wine in bar $12.00 for least expensive white. By the end of the week, we were used to the prices and just paid them without thinking about it. Restaurants that we would recommend in Hotel. Marbella for buffet breakfast, sushi restaurant, italian restaurant $$, and the Tiki Bar (hamburgers, chicken burgers $14). Restaurants off property that we recommend. Isomar Bakery at corner of Rte 3 (cannot walk) has fantastic pastries and sandwiches at very reasonable prices. LaParilla in the kiosks in Luquilla was delicious. Guava's Restaurant on the waterfront (looks like a bar - not at the kiosk locations) was incredible! 787-889-2222 (homemade ice cream around the block too). Old San Juan: Puerto Rico Cafe, the absolute best food! All in all we had a great time. The hotel does not have any night life, not enough activities on property for teenage boys, but we did have a relaxing time. Yes, you do need to reserve your lounge chairs at around 7:30 a.m. Keep your beach towels that they give you as they are constantly out of them! Next vacation, definitely won't be in Puerto Rico.

I picked this resort because we wanted to be away from all the crowds in San Juan. It's in a great location, not far from the Fajardo ferries if you want to take a day trip to Vieques (which I highly recommend). It's also situated on a beautiful stretch of beach with hardly a view of any other hotels in the area. The rainforest is very close by as well, and worth checking out. ~HOTEL- The grounds are extremely well maintained and very beautiful. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. The lobby areas are large and comfortable. Although it is a large hotel, it is very easy to get used to the layout . I didn't like the fact that we had to pay $20 a day for parking. It adds up. The crowd at the hotel was very mixed... young, old, families, singles. There's not much activity at night, so if you're into a lot of night life, I would suggest getting a hotel in San Juan. ~FOOD/DRINKS/RESTAURANTS- The food and drinks are expensive. Best to have breakfast outside of the hotel at Isamar or Palmer bakeries, just up the road. Drinks are expensive, averaging about 12-14 dollars for a mixed drink (in a smallish glass too!). Bring a small cooler if you want to save some money. Lunch is also expensive, save your $$ for dinner. We tried four restaurants at the hotel. I was not impressed with Marbella, the main restaurant. We did , however, LOVE Palio, the Italian restaurant, and dined there twice. It's a little high priced, but the quality was really good, and comparable to a NY restaurant, so we didn't mind. The Tapas bar had good food for a quick bite, and the Tiki Bar at the Beach was also pretty good, but on the expensive side. ~BEACH/POOL AREA- For those of you who are wondering if you can swim in the ocean at the hotel, the answer is YES! It isn't super calm water, but the waves are fun to jump around in, and the beach is long and roomy. There are no waitresses coming around to take drink or food orders if you care about that. We didn't. It's easy to walk over to the Tiki bar to get something. A walk along the beach south of the hotel is worth exploring. I liked the fact that there was a kids pool and an adult pool, each with it's separate hot tubs. The hot tubs were great, always in working order, and very relaxing. The pool areas fill up quickly. (It could have been crowded because we were traveling in a very popular week during high season) Many people got there early to claim their spot, and it was hard to get a lounge chair in the morning or early-mid afternoon if you didn't have a spot. You can rent a cabana area for $100 (!!! ) a day,if you want a guaranteed spot by the pool. We stayed on the beach most of the day, and moved over to the pool area later in the afternoon and had no problem getting a spot. ~DO YOU NEED A CAR?- I would say yes. BUT.. if you just want to stay at the hotel during your whole stay, and take a few planned excursions, you can probably get away without one. We love to explore our surroundings, so a car was a must for us. ~ROOMS- We had a king ocean front room. The view was really nice, and the room was pretty spacious and super clean. The decor was nice.. not ultra updated, but I had no complaints. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was roomy. My only complaint was that there were no refrigerators in the rooms. All and all, we liked the hotel and would definitely recommend it. We had a great time there, and loved the location. It DID seem like you were getting over charged for every little thing. Just be aware of this, and plan ahead to save money. I think they must need to pay for all of the villas they built surrounding the hotel. They DO ask you to attend a seminar to tell you about these villa sales, but they don't press you if you don't care to attend.

Driving is fine in Puerto Rico, don't let other ninnys tell you otherwise, it's pretty much like in the states (in fairness I'm from Boston so maybe I'm immune to crazy drivers). Bring your GPS, you'll be fine. I though the hotel itself was very nice, spacious and clean. Check in was fine and the room was nicer than expected with a balcony overlooking the pool and ocean. Big comfy beds, we had no a/c problems like so many people complained about. The pool was really nice looking tons of lounge chairs (but yes everyone does that \"saving thing\" where they leave their crap on the chair to reserve it then go off for the day). The staff was nice. We had no problems with towels there were plenty and they would give you two. The ocean was beautiful, and they had lounge chairs there and free umbrellas....what could be better? Now for the bad. The parking is $15 a day and I heard the garage was on the opposite side of the resort so we valet(ed) it for the week at $20 a day. Second the food and drinks were CRAZY EXPENSIVE. And not just mixed drinks beers were $8-9 a beer so don't think you'll cheap out and just have a beer. Coffee was like $4.50 a cup. The breakfast buffet was over $50 for 2 (no drinks). Want to grab a salad at lunch at the outdoor bar? $18 for a salad with chicken on the top. The first two days I had free wifi on my phone, the next days they had shut it down so you had to pay or leave the hotel to get internet. In all I think they would make so much more money if they would be reasonable in pricing. For instance we would have wanted to stay at the bar and had drinks, instead we brought in drinks from other places, thanks to the other reviewer I brought a cooler bag. We desperately wanted some nightlife at the hotel but it was not be be had (at least mid week). I think the prices drive people off. It's almost like they want to drive you off....doesn't make sense to me. . There are a lot of good options for food and drinks if you have a car. Anonijitos at the bottom of the hill was good. The bakery, Isomar, right at the lights is awesome! Great breakfast sandwiches and oatmeal, and nice people. Going towards Loquillo there are some nice restaurants that look very divey from the outside but are very good. You'll find most all the restaurants to be very heavy on meat and starch. Tough to find vegetables or salads which for some reason I crave when I go to the Caribbean or a warm climate.

First,let me tell you the things that we liked...the grounds, pools and beach are great. There was always plenty of room in the pool and on the beach for everyone to enjoy themselves. Our room had a mountain view and we thought the beds were comfortable and did not have any problems with the cleanliness or the heating and cooling of the room. The hotel parking was fine, we never had any problem finding a parking space. The hotel is in a good location; right across from the rainforest, 30-40 minutes from San Juan, close to Fajardo and the marina for excursions, and close to restaurants and grocery/drug stores. My biggest complaint is the extremely overpriced food and drinks at the hotel. As other people have mentioned, a beer is $7, a mixed drink is $12.50, and a kid's lemonade is $4! We only ate dinner one night at the hotel, it was the night we arrived when we were very tired and very hungry. We ate at Shima, the asian restaurant, and the food was average in taste and over priced. We did have some issues with our room key not working and with there not being enought towels by the pool, as other people have mentioned. Here are my suggestions to make your stay at the Rio Mar and your trip to Puerto Rico great... eat breakfast at Don Pepe, right down the road from the resort. The \"mallorca\" is fabulous (breakfast sandwich with the best bread ever!). The pancakes, made with cinnamon and vanilla are also awesome. Stock up at Walgreen's and the Amigo grocery store for snacks, food, and water/drinks.Get some sandwiches for lunch at the Miramar Bakery which is right at the end of the road when leaving the hotel. Eat dinner at Hacienda Caribale which is again, near the hotel. The \"mufongo\" and the skirt steak are wonderful. We went there two times because the food was soooo good. We had mexican food one night at Lolita's and that was good too. I know a alot of people recommend La Parilla (one of the kiosks), but we had a terrible experience. We waited over an hour for our food and when it arrived our steak was only half cooked. I would highly recommend booking your Biobay excursion through East Island Excursions; they were fantastic. Very organized, professional experience from start to finish. Your excursion includes the boat ride to Vieques, dinner, and the biobay experience which includes swimming in the bay. It is a must do while in this area. We also enjoyed our trip to the rainforest (we hiked on our own), visit to San Juan and San Cristobel fort and zip lining with the company \"Rain Forest Zip Line Corp\". They are located right outside the rainforest and are great for familes with young children. Overall, a great experience in Puerto Rico and I would recommend it to my friends.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDON'T GO!!!\u201d", "Author": "mair813", "ReviewID": "UR98901967", "Content": "If your mind isn't already chaged by all of the negative reviews, let this be the last one.

First off let me say that this is a beautiful hotel, pool, and beach. The whole resort is just stunning. But, it all started off badly and then there were just too many problems. Service was terrible, so we wont be going back. When we checked in we were told our chosen double bed room was not available. Ever tried to fit a family of four into one King sized bed? After politely asking for the correct room , the clerk said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and just smiled at me. After getting mean and demanding a room, she disappeared into the back for a long 10 minutes, came back out and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we were able to find you a double-bed room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Like the room just miraculously came open in the last 10 mins? at 11pm? Like they were doing me some kind of favor? That was just the start. When we trudged our family & gear to the room (no bell hops available), our electronic key would not work. After three trips back to the front desk, someone finally came to the room and opened it up for us, and told us to go back in the morning for new keys. Over the course of the 10 days there, the keys quit working about every other day and we kept having to go get new ones from the front desk. And no, we did not place them near cell phones, speaker magnets etc which can erase them. Annoying. If you have a car they charge $15 a day to self park! This might be ok if this is a big-city hotel with limited parking, but they have acres and acres of parking, why charge? And the process for self parking and validating your ticket was a huge pain. To make matters worse, we left the resort for two days on an excursion to another island, and they still charged us for those two days we were gone! I am sure I could have gotten them to take that off my bill, but why shold I have to? And by the time we checked out I was just too frustrated to deal with it. As a comparison, I stayed at the Maui Ritz last year and self parking was FREE. The vast majority of staff were not very friendly at all. I just want people that work there to be nice, helpful, friendly, courteous, etc. Apparently that is too much to ask of the folks at this 4-star resort. 10% were friendly, 40% didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice you, and 50% acted annoyed. The restaurants at the resort are nice, but expensive. Typical for a resort like this but not unexpected. All in all, service was a huge disappointment, and the main reason I would not go back.

The resort itself is beautiful, secluded and right on the beach. Really, the location is the best feature of this hotel. We woke up every morning and looked out at the ocean from our balcony...beautiful! Also, you could walk to the beach and get chairs and towels for free and there was lots of space to spread out and relax without someone right next to you. There is about a mile of beach, so going for a walk in either direction will let you take beautiful photographs from many different locations. Also, the hotel is right near the rainforest, so excursions are close and easy to get to. Service: Everyone at the hotel was friendly and responsive to our needs, although sometimes service was a little slow at the Tours and Travel desk. be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes if there is anyone in front of you. Also, they have an antiquated system of booking excursions, having to call each time to see if they had space available on tours and then hand write out each voucher...can't they book trips on the computer? The room service was exceptional and a much better value than some of the restaurants. Food and drink: WAY overpriced. I realize that you are on a resort and things are going to be a bit more expensive, but $7 for a Corona and $6 for a bag of Doritos? We didn't rent a car, but paid for a taxi to Amigos Supermarket for snacks and drinks and that easily saved us over a hundred dollars. Also, I wouldn't mind paying for the food in the restaurants if it was delicious, but truly it was just adequate. Why would I travel to the Caribbean to eat fast food take out or cheap Italian? It would be nice if they offered some local cuisine. Again, it will cost you, but a cab ride to eat somewhere else (Hacienda or Richie's) will be well worth it and you'll get better food. Rooms: The rooms were big and clean with a great view. The water pressure was poor and inconsistent, sometimes barely even a trickle coming out of the shower...not fun to try to wash off a day at the beach with a trickle of water that may or not be hot. It was a minor annoyance, but you expect more from a \"resort\". Location and excursions: We booked ahead of time through Dragonfly adventures and we were happy with their service. They pick you up right at the hotel and take care of everything. Bring an empty backpack so you can fill it with snacks because often the excursions last several hours and nothing is offered with them. Also, if you prepaid, book your tours right when you get there. We almost missed out on a few because they booked up so quickly, so we had to double up on our last day there. We took the Rainforest \"Hike\" (more of a walk), the ATV rides (very fun and gorgeous setting), and the Bio Bay Kayak (amazing and well worth it). Overall, it was a clean hotel with friendly service and a gorgeous location and view. Be prepared to spend lots of money on food and drinks that are just mediocre unless you go out and get some of your own.

We got in late on Thursday and not having to drive late at night to an unfamiliar location in the rain was definitely a plus. Have seen high taxi/shuttle costs from airport to the resort so having transportation included in our hotel package was a big benefit. Make sure you rent a car! There is an Enterprise rental in the hotel so I made a reservation on-line and we picked up our car on Friday morning and dropped of the keys on Tuesday morning. VERY convenient. Just make sure that you make a reservation because while the agent was there at the time we were to pick up the car - she was hard to find at other times. Not an issue for us, but we often saw people waiting at the desk looking for her. Self- parking is $15/day. The valet is $20. Self parking is very quick and convenient though the parking lot does get very full on Saturday night. There is live entertainment in the hotel restaurants/bar/casino on the weekends. They posted a sign board with the various performers. It was good music and we joined others dancing in the lobby bar. The live music in the casino gave it a fun vibe. We spent Friday at Luquillo beach just because we wanted to get out and explore but the beach at the hotel is very pretty. On the weekend when Luquillo is crowded, it was nice to have a beautiful beach at the resort to walk, dip into the waves, and then rinse off at the showers and take a dip in the pool. We made it a point to spend some time at the beach or pool every day. Even if it was just an evening soak in the hot tub.

Can I shop at the duty free shop if I am traveling to Puerto Rico from the US? -Yes! Even though PR is considered a US territory, it is an international flight. You can shop duty free at the US airport before boarding your flight, or at the PR airport after you land. Also, you only need to be 18 to drink in PR. Can I drink the tap water in Puerto Rico? -Yes! Tap water is treated and is officially safe to drink. I used it to make coffee in the room and it tasted great. Is there a car rental company at the hotel? -Yes! Enterprise has a desk in the lobby of the hotel and they charge about $50/per day for an economy sized car. I highly recommend making reservations ahead of time. During my visit, it was not possible to rent a car the day of because they were out. I had to contact Cabrera Car Rental, which is about 10 minutes away from the hotel and cost slightly higher than Enterprise. They offer shuttle service to and from the hotel. They will pick you up from the hotel to rent a car and when you drop off the car, they will drive you back to the hotel. Is it possible to walk to a restaurant outside the hotel? -No, absolutely not. It probably takes 15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 minutes to just walk to the entrance of the resort. Outside the resort, there is no sidewalk and the road is narrow. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the risk of being run over by a car, it probably takes another 20-25 minutes to walk to the bottom of the hill to the closest restaurant. Cost: I booked through CheapCaribbean.com and spent about $600 per person for 5 nights including air from the Midwest. What a deal! Tips: 1. Rent a car from the airport. I know I was scared to (and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rent one at the airport but wish I had). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about half the cost of renting it from the resort ($25 vs $50 a day). Cab ride from San Juan to Rio Mar would cost around $80. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to drive anywhere, you can purchase round trip shuttle from Dragonfly Adventures. Depending on how long you plan to stay, it could be cheaper than the cost of transportation just to and from the airport. Getting around in a car is easy and not as bad as some make it sound. Yes, I think there are lots of crazy drivers in PR, but just be a defensive driver. Parking at the hotel is $15 a day. You take a ticket each time you go into the parking garage and bring it to the valet to have it validated before you want to leave. Gas cost about $15 for 2 days (2 round trips to San Juan plus local driving). 2. Bring a GPS. My Garmin worked in PR and as long as I had the hotel location programmed, I knew I could always find my way back. http://www.puertoricodaytrips.com/gps/ is a great website and has a page with GPS coordinates so you can pre-program before your trip. I found them very helpful, especially the one for the hotel! (Latitude: +18\u00c2\u00b0 22' 55.12\" Longitude: -65\u00c2\u00b0 45' 50.44\") 3. Bring a cooler. I used my cooler every day since there is no fridge in the room. Each floor has an ice machine so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenient. 4. Bring travel mugs. They come in handy, especially when you bring your own beverage to mix. 5. Have breakfast at Isamar Bakery at the bottom of the hill. $4 for an omelet! They have breakfast, sandwiches, pizza, fresh bread, and amazing pastries. The coconut pudding is so delicious, I wish I had purchased the whole tray. The coffee is also very good here. 6. Try Mofongo! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plantains mashed, fried, and mashed again and served with a variety of meats. Room: The room was very big and had 2 double beds, desk and chair, dressers and big screen TV. There is also table and chairs on the balcony. The closet is large and contains a safe where you can store your valuables. There is a lot of counter space in the bathroom and it is supplied with Bath and Body products. The in-room coffee is delicious (tasty and bold) and is replenished daily. Restaurants: The food at the restaurants is quite good. They are expensive, but served in big portions. You have to take into account the cab cost if you were to eat off the resort and mentally subtract it from the bill. The sushi rolls from Shimas were very big, tasty and filling. Spa: The facility is outstanding and the services come with a big price tag. I was actually suckered into the 2 hour timeshare presentation and received a couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 25 minutes massage valued at $175 at this spa. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only reason for my visit to the spa. Personally, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make enough to afford $130 plus tip for a 50 minute back massage\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no matter how big my knot is. Time Share Presentation: The presenter spent about 45 minutes giving a tour of the resort, which I quite enjoyed. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an iguana feeding area where we saw several colorful and large iguanas munching on lettuce. The other half of the presentation was very boring as he tried to get a down payment from us, but bearable. Was it worth the 25 minute massage\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the jury is still out on that. Casino: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small, but has all the essentials. Free drinks (small and infrequent, better tip your waitress well), slots, black jack, roulette, and poker. You can request $5 casino vouchers from within the casino or at the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk that you can use at the black jack or roulette table (max of 5 per night). If you play your voucher on a winning hand, you get an extra $5 chip added to your winnings. Yay, free money! The black jack tables were fun, $5 minimum during the day and $10 min at night. Overall, we made a small donation to the casino. Service: Exceptional! Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The concierge welcomed us after we checked in, provided us with loads of information and sent us off on our merry ways. They were also helpful in providing us with maps and driving directions. When I called to ask for a late check out, they were more than happy to let me stay until 12:30p instead of kicking me out at 11am. Pool and Beach: There are 2 pools and a hot tub that are opened 24 hours! The beach is beautiful and there were plenty of chairs to go around. This resort is huge! Location: Rio Grande is much closer to the excursions than if I had stayed in San Juan. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close the rainforest and Fajardo (Bio Bay and Ferry for Culebra). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 40 minute drive East of the city. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 10 minute drive to the rainforest, and what a beautiful drive it is through El Yunque. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an outlet mall nearby if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re into that sort of thing. Excursions: You can save money by booking excursions yourself rather than go through the hotel. Sample of cost of excursions through the hotel (transportation included \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think): Rainforest Nature Hike $59 Rainforest Horseback Ride $93 Old SJ Historical & Shopping $61 Bacardi & Old SJ $75 Bio Bay Kayak $99 Kayaking and Snorkel Tour $105 Culebra Day Trip & Snorkel $150 Bioluminescent Bay and Snorkeling: I was very happy with my Bio Bay and Culebra tour I booked with kayakingpuertorico.com. The website is easy to use, the tour guides were informative and charming, and they also post pictures from the excursion on Facebook. Bring water shoes for the Bio Bay tour, but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need one for the snorkeling. The ferry ride to Culebra is 1.5 hours long. I am not prone to seasickness, but I have never felt sicker than on the ferry ride to Culebra. I recommend Dramamine and sitting on the top deck. The ride back was not bad since we were going with the current. The snorkeling was worth the trip! Ziplining: You can make a reservation with these guys: http://yunkezipline.wordpress.com. It was fun and not as physically demanding as I thought it was going to be. In fact, it was quite relaxing to be in the rainforest and enjoyed the slow pace. The meeting point is less than 10 minutes drive from the resort. It would probably cost about $20 to take a cab there, and you would have to call for one to pick you back up. Bacardi Tour: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free! Park at the visitor parking lot, get your 2 free drink vouchers, enjoy some rum drinks, and spend half an hour listening to the history of Bacardi. Pretty good way to start off a day if you ask me. Hipodromo Camarero (Horse Race Track): It was easy to find (about a 20 minute drive from the resort) and there are lots of signs to help you along the way. The track itself is beautiful and nicely kept. Entrance is free and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place to see the locals. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see many tourists while I was there. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a clubhouse upstairs that gives you a great view of the track and it also has a bar and a restaurant.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester Hills, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWe aren't that picky but...very poor service, disappointing\u201d", "Author": "pmaria2", "ReviewID": "UR96849670", "Content": "I can't figure out why the other raters mostly wrote glowing reviews of this resort.!

Decent value.\u201d", "Author": "lawfive", "ReviewID": "UR96773967", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights at Rio Mar. I can't wait to go back. I did read a lot of the reviews on here, and so I had my guard up. I'll try to comment on a few as I go. Cleanliness: Perfect. The housekeepers did an excellent job every day, and the grounds were in top shape. No complaints here. Service: Everyone that worked there was super friendly. With few exceptions, the staff offered a \"good morning\" or \"good afternoon\", and asked if there was anything I needed. The only exception to this, strangly, was in the casino. The pit boss was friendly, but most of the dealers just wanted to do their job and that was about it. No real complaints though: they weren't mean. They just didn't want to socialize. Perhaps English was not their first language? Location: A bit far from the airport, but not horrible. It is secluded, which is nice, and right across the street from the rainforest. The resort itself is right on the ocean, so you can't beat that. Value: The rooms are not that expensive. But everything else is. Tip #1: If you are coming from the continental US, stop at the duty free shop and pick up some alcohol before getting to the resort. That will save you tons of money. They have plenty of mixer-type drinks at the gift shop and around, so just get that and mix. The food onsite is good. I enjoyed the coffee shop outside of the casino and their restaurants. But again, they are expensive, but if you know that going in and factor it into your cost, I suspect the deal you get with the room rates makes up for it. So that's why I said \"Decent Value\". Rooms: We had a rainforest view, which was pretty good. I suspect the ocean view rooms were outstanding. No microwaves or fridge, but not that big of a deal. Big bathrooms. Quiet rooms. Sleep Quality: Slept like a baby every night. Caveat: I spent every night at the casino, so was plenty tired when I went to bed. A few other things to note: The casino: Offers Blackjack, Roulette, 3 Card Poker, Texas Holdem, slots and video poker. The Blackjack is pretty good. 3:2 on blackjack, dealer stays on any 17. During the day, the minimum bet is $5, but they raise it to $10 after the sun sets. Roulette is $2 minimum all day and night. Holdem...they had a wait list the one night for 2/5 no limit cash. I can't imagine they can find 10 people to play that on a given night. 3 card poker is $5 all the time. I suspect the slots have horrible return. However, FREE DRINKS if you are gambling. I was pleasantly suprised by this. This place is a nice way to wind down a busy day of fun in the sun. Tip #2: if you are playing a lot there - sign up for a players card. Each day you are there, they will give you a $10 matchplay. All you need is the card and to simply ask for it. The pool: Tip #3: If you love lounging pool side and will spend the day there, get a cabana. They are $100 (or $75 if you have the 25% discount card). This seems high, but it comes with a bucket of snacks (chips, cookies) and a cooler of water and juices. Given how high the food/drink prices are, this almost pays for itself. The ocean: take a walk down the beach and head east (turn right out of the resort). There is a river that bends into the rainforest. It is perfect for pictures with the rainforest in the background. Worth exploring. Speaking of the rainforest - it is right across the street and worth exploring if you have the time.

It is a grand hotel with many rooms and even condos, a golf course, and many restaurants. I agree with most users that the restaurants are pricey! More interestingly though they cater to american taste so there is a steakhouse, sushi restaurant, and italian restaurant. Considering how much the entrees were, I did not feel the need to try them as I am sure they are not close to being as good as the restaurants back home. I did however have a meal at the tiki bar- a burger and it was good but not extraoridinary. Definitely rent a car if you stay here as just the shuttle ride to and from the hotel will cost as much as a car rental. Only thing with a car is that you have to pay for parking at the hotel. Considering how much land the resort is on, it is surprising how limited their parking is. A car is must for any of the adventures as you must drive to the locations. The hotel itself is 45min drive from the airport in San Juan. The room itself was clean with a tile floor. The bathroom was spacious and clean although the tub was stained. Our room had a small balcony and a view of the beach. I would not recommend opening the sliding door for long periods of time as it allows the warn HUMID PR air to condense in your room. Not a good idea! The beds were comfortable and the room nicely decorated. The resort has several pools and two jacuzzi. One adult only pool, and an activity pool for the family. The activity pool includes a waterslide which the children loved and a volleyball net. Right outside of the pool area is the beach with plenty of lounge chairs for enjoying the beach.

We stayed for a week and we visited the store twice. We did have a car however, so that may be a serious consideration. We spent $100 on the car for 7 days and we probably would have spent that eating two of the cheapest meals at the hotel (for the 2 of us.)

The location on a long stretch of North facing beach is very nice if you like to swim in the salt water. There was enough action to body surf and surf. For some reason the hotels or condos nearby seemed empty and deserted but the upshot is that the beach is very unpopulated and the walks along the shore in the afternoon were very quiet. The staff at the hotel were friendly if not always informed. We generally ate at the hotel and found the food nice for dinner. Breakfast was okay. It was expensive but easy. We ate lunch off site twice at two diners our cab driver recommended and took us too. He waited while we ate and the cost is minimal. For such a large hotel we were not bothered by noise (5th floor room of 6 floors) but we don't live in the country. The tree frogs and surf were lovely to listen to. The wind kept the mosquitos from appearing though I doubt anyone can count on that. The hotel can arrange activities or you can do it on your own. We snorkeled through Mini Boat Adventures which was not offered by the hotel. It was less expensive than the catamaran cruise that the hotel offered. We motored our own small boat. There was one other boat of 4 and two guides, Winnick and Juan, (each with boat). These pontoons really moved and the limiting factor was really the surf which made it a wild ride at high speeds. My 12 year old was allowed to drive so that was a thrill for him. The guides were very kind, not too silly, and they knew a lot about the local fish, coral, ecosystems and islands and were very informative it anyone was interested. We hired a taxi driver, Israel, to take us to some of the attractions. +41 44919 8300. He was inexpensive and helpful and found us a guide for the National Rainforest, el Yunque, so we could visit at our own pace. If we visit again we will call him to meet us at the airport. We took the airport shuttle and it was the same price. Still, it is convenient. If you need or want to go to Walgreens or the market, Israel can get you there and back for about $30 - 35 dollars and will wait an hour. Through the hotel my son took a surf lesson and the instructor was great. He did not rush the lesson and offered that we all use his boards until he needed them again.

Like other reviews mentioned the condition of our room was pathetic. The ceiling in the bathroom was falling in and looked as if my 9 year old son attempted to repair it. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom so the room becomes full of steam and 'muggy' on day one. Opening the balcony door helps, but when it is hot outside you don't want that door open. The decorative pillows on our bed had some sort of liquid stain on all of them I convinced myself it was a water stain but was still grossed out. The sheets had stains on them, and it took multiple requests to have them replaced. As well the walls are paper thin. They seemed especially thin with 'frisky' neighbors - that was a real drag. The Food and Beverage service was a joke. Drinks anyplace on the property were $11+. Food was way expensive. Burgers and sandwiches were running $14 - $14 and the $10 appetizer were so small I was left wondering how they tasted. In one instance my ordered nacho chips and cheese to dip. We had to send it back 3 times because they could not figure out how to heat up the cheese. We were fortunate to have a car to go elsewhere to eat. We made plans in San Juan and Fajardo. Without this ability to to leave the hotel I cannot imagine how much we would have spent in Food and Beverage. We, as did many many, others, went to Walmart got a small disposable cooler, water, snack and beer. One case of Madella at Walmart = 2 Madella's at the pool. Many times when trying to leave the garage I had to wait for some one to come take my ticket and open the gate. One time the guy was washing his car and I suppose wanted to finish a side before letting out. I watched him for 5 minutes while he ignore me.

If you have a car, there are alternatives to eating totally on site. If not, be prepared to be extravagant. To avoid every drink being $10+, I would recommend a bottle packed in a bubble wrap style bag for your suitcase, or buying a bottle at the San Juan airport so you can have a cocktail in your room. The hotel gift shop also has a limited offering of alcohol which is more modestly priced than the Tiki Bar. by the pool. All in all, a great vacation place, with no worries about security.

I agree with other readers that the food and the drinks are wildly overpriced, but we managed. Some days we got the cold buffet for breakfast and made sandwiches we could eat at lunchtime, which makes the price worth it. We had a pretty unimpressive lunch at the beachside bar one day, but we didn't eat at any of the other hotel restaurants. Drinks at the beachside bar are about $3 more than the bar inside the hotel, so we bought most of our own alcohol at a grocery store and brought it to the beach. You also need to rent a refrigerator for your room for $10/day, but they didn't end up charging us for that. Highly recommend renting a car so you don't have to pay for the expensive but unremarkable food, and so you can explore on your own! the hotel has an iguana habitat which is pretty cool- feeding the iguanas is supposed to be a kids activity, but my friends and I participated, and all thought it was one of the highlights of our hotel time. Overall, this is a great property if you get a deal on your rooms. Definitely worth the extra money for an Ocean view, but can't see how there'd be much of a difference between \"ocean view\" and \"ocean front\". I would have been disappointed if we'd been stuck on the property all week, so definitely rent a car! Restaurants in the area to try: There is a place a little farther up the hill from Richie's, which is quieter and has more local food, as well as amazing fresh seafood at half the price and twice the local ambience of Richies. The antojitos place down the hill is not bad for breakfast. Best meals were at a restaurant called Calizo in Fajardo (upscale seafood, outdoor seating), Agua Viva (in Old San Juan) and Hacienda Caravali, which is just down the street. Great food, great service, and we even convinced them to let us do night time go carting after dinner! Don't miss this place- very cute. Activities- El Yunque, definitely go to the Kiosko beach (Luquillo) for tasty Puerto Rican snacks, and fresh coconut water served in the coconut with a straw. Also, kayaking in the bioluminescent bay in Fajardo was a once in a lifetime experience. Must see! Solid hotel- nice staff, clean rooms, nice exterior landscaping, good beach and pool amenities-towels, beach chairs, umbrellas all included (they say the hotel pool closes at 6pm, but we went in the pool and hot tub every night, and the staff didn't mind at all). We felt a little nickle-and-dimed by all the extra charges for fridge, drinks, parking, etc... but it was still a good time.

They have delicious local Ice cream flavors... made with no milk.....(coconut, passion fruit, guava, tamarind etc.) and on Sundays they have shaved ice with syrup, another local treat.

We were there to celebrate our 10th anniversary, and overall, we enjoyed our weekend, but the hotel does have some issues that need to be dealt with urgently. It was raining very hard on the day of our arrival. We live in Puerto Rico, so we took our own car and opted for self-parking. My husband dropped me off at the entrance, and went to park. As I waited, no fewer than 5 persons slipped and/or fell right at the entrance due to the humidity. Check in was quick and efficient, and the front desk female employee was very friendly and professional. We got to the room, and the room is average size, leaning more towards the small range. El Conquistador Resort has bigger rooms. Since the weather was so bad, we decided to eat at the hotel. We went to Marbella Restaurant, which was buffet style only on that evening. The service was excellent, the employees were very friendly and efficient, and the food was exceptional. The cost for two persons, with drinks and tax, came out to be $71. We had breakfast there the next day, and paid $23 per person, but the breakfast was not as good, and it was packed. The service was also not as good as for dinner, although that might have been due to the amount of customers. The resort is nicely decorated, and has all the appropriate amenities required of a resort. The pools look good, although I did not use them. The beach is beautiful! In this aspect, this hotel is better than El Conquistador, since everything is right there (no need to take a ferry to go to the Beach). The hotel also has a playground for kids. And yes, there are many large iguanas hanging around. Some people find this lovely, but I'm not a huge fan of them, so I steered clear out of their way. The casino is small, but has all the necessary tables and slot machines. I played and won a couple of bucks, which is more than I've ever won anywhere (even in Vegas). The only problem I have with this hotel are the rooms. Rooms need some serious upgrades. The pillows are way too soft, the curtains have mold, the shower had mold, and so did the shower curtain. There was a hole in the ceiling behind the curtains, from where the plaster fell off and it looks awful. The balconies are not cleaned, and the chairs and table are dirty. The bed cover was stained on the inside, and some of the towels had noticeable stains. And these are what I noticed, as I don't go out of my way to look for negative things to complain about. I'm sure that if I had opted to pay closer attention to all details, I would have found additional things. What really is the kicker, though, is the noise. Those walls are paper thin. You can hear conversations from both rooms beside yours and the hallway, can hear the TV, the phone, the shower, the flush of the toilets, you name it. And if you can hear it, they can definitely hear you. My husband is a sound sleeper, and even he would be awaken. In my case, it was worse as I am a very light sleeper. The first day I was rudely awaken by some woman screaming, at 3 in the morning, because she saw a spider in the hallway. The second night, I couldn't go to sleep because the kids in the next room were screaming and playing around. I have kids, so I was being patient. Then the fire alarm went off!! Since the kids had been playing in the hallway as well, my husband called the front desk but no one answered. We leave the room and join the other guests on the emergency exit. And this is where our stay got better. The emergency exit stairs were WET. VERY, VERY WET due to the humidity. No one could hurry, as we were slipping around, and eventually one child fell down some steps. We finally reached the first floor, and started to head towards the parking lot (there are no signs on the stairwell indicating the proper floor to exit from, at least none that I noticed). When we reach the area where we can see the lobby (which is on the third floor, above us at that point), we realized that the lobby bar was in full swing. So there we were, this huge group of guests, most in their sleepwear and all definitely looking as if we had rushed out of our rooms (which we had), and there is another huge group of persons drinking, dancing, talking, and at the Casino. No one at the lobby area had heard the fire alarm. Talk about a major safety risk. My husband grabbed a passing employee, and she had no idea what we were referring to. She contacted security via her radio, and security indicated it was a false alarm, that some kids had indeed pulled it somewhere. The security measures in the hotel are severely lacking. So, yes the hotel is lovely, beautiful beach area, nice pools, etc. BUT, if you choose to stay, be aware that there are some issues that may cause your discomfort.

We went to the rainforest one day. It was alright, but I have seen nicer! We did eat a cheeseburger in the park and it was good. Cheeseburger prices at the hotel are $14.00. They are big and good. Cons: We traveled with 2 small children who needed milk and formula to be cold. The first day we got there, we asked for a fridge to be brought up to our room and they put us on a waiting list. We got one 3 days into our trip. It was a little frustrating keeping a styrofoam cooler filled with ice for 3 days. I guess you need to request a fridge before you arrive to ensure you will get one. There are iguanas everywhere by the pool and the last day we were there one bit a lady on her arm. He was trying to get her sandwich. They didn't bother people, but I guess he was hungry! Just be careful. Pros: The resturants were good. Pricey resort food, but worth not having to leave the resort. The sushi was good and I loved the pineapple shrimp stir-fry. We got upgraded to a mountain view room just by asking. My mom got upgraded to an oceanview room for free by tipping the guy $10.00!! It doesn't hurt to ask. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean. They leave plenty of towels and coffee in the rooms each day. The service throughout the hotel was good. The cleanliness of the hotel was great. Liquor drinks are between $11-$16 depending on what you drink. Beers are $7 and sodas are $3.50. The casino is small, but they have adequate games and machines. Your drinks are free while you gamble. Internet in your room is $15 a day. If you rent a car, the price to self-park is $15 a day and valet is $20 a day. The gift shop is pricey. If you have a vehicle, you can drive to a few cheaper places. At the bottom of the hill by the resort, there is a convenient store that sells beer, liquor and snacks. There is also a bakery that has wonderful breakfast sandwiches! We went there everyday to avoid resort breakfast prices. We ate at Richies cafe one night, it is above the resort. It was overpriced and the food was not good. I would eat at the resort for dinner. We drove into Old San Juan one evening. The conceirge gave us good driving directions.

If you want to tour Puerto Rico then rent a car. I found the best pricing with Enterprise. The airport shuttle is too expensive and the shuttle tour pricing was too expensive. The resort is located about 20 - 25 miles East of San Juan just off of PR-3 in Rio Grande. PR-3 is somewhat of a busy road with many traffic lights but as you near the turn off for the Wyndham Rio Mar resort there are good sized road signs. The resort has two pools. One is adult only. Of course there is the beach. Lots of walking/jogging paths. The gym (located on the lower level of the west wing) is in the spa area and is adequate. There is a charge for parking. Self parking, located under the conference center building, is $15.00 per night plus tax. Valet parking runs $20.00 per night plus tax. If you self park then you must take your ticket to the valet desk for validation before you take your car from the lot but this was not as inconvenient as it sounds. At checkout at the end of your stay have the front desk stamp your parking ticket before you go to the valet desk for validation. As mentioned by others the restaurants are expensive. I did not feel that $15.00 or so was too much to pay for a hamburger or wrap at the outside restaurant or the Iguana restaurant at the golf club but the buffet prices at the Marbella were high ($24.00 for breakfast and $7.00 for a pot of coffee). We ate one night at the Palio. Prices there seemed to be comparable to a nice restaurant at home. Just outside the casino is a self-service area with coffee, bagels, donuts, wraps, sandwiches, etc. The sandwich and wrap prices were okay but the rest of the stuff was expensive. At this self-service area a can of soda was $3.50 but just down the hall, at the gift shop, that same can of soda was $1.38! For breakfast we drove out of the resort toward PR-3. Just before the traffic light, on the left, is a fenced in parking lot with a bakery and chinese restaurant. The bakery is not fancy by any means but the donuts and coffee were good. They also serve breakfast sandwiches. If you're into hamburgers there is a Fuddruckers just off the east bound lane of PR-3 near the industrial area mid-way between San Juan and the resort.

PR-66 is lightly traveled and does have one $1,50 toll booth. To get to the rain forest from the resort just drive across PR-3, turn right at the gas station and then left at rain forest road sign (PR-191) and head up the mountain. If you drive to Old San Juan then I recommend you get off PR-26 onto PR-1 and drive past the cruise ship piers. Just past the piers, along the Old San Juan wall is a public parking lot.

I am a 21 year old business analyst for Deloitte and although I am capable of affording a nice vacation, the people at Rio Mar seemed to think otherwise. Because of my age and the age of the person I was traveling with, we were totally disrespected and disregarded. On two separate occasions (in only a three day span), servers at the restaurants (the Tiki Bar and Marbella) refused to acknowledge us. We sat for over 10 minutes before getting up and walking out since neither restaurant was busy at the time and there were servers who had clearly made eye contact with us. On a third occasion, we were sitting at the Tiki Bar again and we waited 45 minutes for a hamburger and the person who sat down 15 minutes after us got the same exact burger we ordered before us. When we decided to cancel the order because we were so outraged, the woman insisted it was ready so we then waited another 15 minutes. She did give us the burger for free but did not pay the whole bill (which only included one $6.50 10oz beer). RIDICULOUS. And that was only the dining component. But I will not bore you with the details from the rest of our trip. Just imagine how bad the rest was if that was only the food. The worst part is when we finally complained (after we had checked out and paid up), the woman that did a bad job of acting like she cared about what we were saying had the audacity to ask my companion to be quiet (with her finger in the air and all) as she spoke despite the fact we were the one's complaining. Shouldn't she have been listening?? I will say that the property was nice so they have that going for them. But that does not make up for the quality of the service. Last year I stayed at El Conquistador and although that complex lacked a decent beach, the service was impeccable. It is a shame when a resort is incapable of understanding that a dollar is a dollar despite who it is coming from. Never once did I not tip 20% throughout the entire trip, whether it was the cab driver or the server or even the Concierge. The service was so bad that I was often made to feel embarrassed which should never be the case.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunn, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cHave Fun and Don't Listen to Everyone else\u201d", "Author": "kjzv237", "ReviewID": "UR94076000", "Content": "The place is great.

Without a rental car we would have felt very trapped on the resort. Everything is overpriced once you're there, and the service is not great. A couple examples - day trips to El Yunque (3 miles away) were $59 per person. We drove up a couple times and there's no entrance fee or charges for anything. This alone paid for our rental car! (although they do charge $15/night for parking at the hotel). Another con - we talked with the concierge about things to do in the area. He was very knowledgeable & helpful, but then went into a spiel about going to a time share breakfast. The actual hotel was gorgeous. We booked an ocean view & I am so happy we did. Our view was fantastic! We spent a lot of time in the mornings drinking coffee & reading on our balcony. It was also great going down to the beach. You can request a couple chairs and a beach umbrella to be set up where you want.

We were blessed enough to have a 7th floor ocean view room so we could keep the balcony door open. We froze on arrival but with A/C turned down as far as possible we were warm enough, no problems with wet floors---like lower floors had and spectacular views--no trees blocking our view. We were also lucky enough to be on the west side which gets most of the sun. The room was spotless and the housekeeping responsive to our requests but the curtain had rips---my only room complaint. For the down side, you are pretty much a captive to overpriced meals and excursions. Take everyones advice and rent a car ahead of time. We caught on pretty fast since I did my homework on this website and followed suggestions offered here. We rented a car on day 2 and kept it until day before we left. We had to pay a $500.00 deposit on the car. And, oh ya, the resort put a $100.00 a night hold on my account so that was a surprising dent in my debit card. No one had mentioned this to me before hand--not cheap caribbean or the resort ($600.00). So there went $1,100.00 of our spending money we had no clue would disappear! Our first dinner when we arrived at the resort was over $60.00 and it was a la carte. Breakfast for just 1 was $22.00 and a lg pot of coffee was $7.00. We started tipping the housekeeper well to get extra coffee. Then we got the car for $65.00 a day from Carabbra and that included insurance. The car only had 2000 miles on it. We went to Walgreens and bought a cooler. Next door was Amigo's supermarket and I bought sandwich and snack stuff including soda. Next to that plaza is the most awesome bakery that also served breakfast and lunch. It's La Parilla and the propietor is very attentive and takes great pride in his bakery. They have the most wonderful desserts and donuts that I've ever see or ate in all my life. It's that good! The other places we really enjoyed were Antojitos at base of hill going to the resort, the kiosks in Luquillo is a must for authentic cuisine also. I recommend Antojitos (not affiliated with other resturant) but awesome. Great fahitas----sizzling when served and the burritos were delicious as were the tacos--al served with a side--we had beans and rice. It's kiosk #23, clean with attentive service. Next door was the Coral Reef #24. I had a 16 oz lobster tail for $30.00. Again, these people take great pride in their food and service. We saved so much in food by going off the resort that it paid for the car many times over. Most meals average $20.00 for 2 and that's for dinner. Lunch is about $15. Breakfast is cheaper. I'd also recommend Don Pepe's but their prices are what you'd pay here. Excellent resturant and service. Stay away from the lobster---it's caribbean, cost $25.00 a pound and they only had a 3 pounder. Research that type of lobster---only tail is edible and cost us $81.00. I had an excellent chicken dish for $15. It's the first right on Rt 3 and an immediate right into resturant. Extremely nice and spotless. We also ate at Martin's BBQ. Great chicken! Also traditional PR food. Less than $20.00 for 2. On the resort--a hot dog is $8.00 and a hamburger is $15.00. No authentic Puerto Rican food. Get off the resort to eat! It's easy to navigate around and you can drive to any attraction at your leisure. Hard to win at the Casino's and the parking is about $16.00 a day. Don't be held captive at the Resort. Enjoy the beauty, pools and ocean then leave and do what you want. Even if you're rich and don't concern yourself with prices--it's still the best way to really see and enjoy Puerto Rico and it's people by renting a car. Taxi's cost a small fortune for the average person. Will we go back? Probably not. We'll book a hotel on a beach, rent a car ahead of time and explore the island on our own. Do we regret it--- no, it was a taste of how the rich live. We are everyday, average people earning over $100,000 a year and found the resort expensive! The sales staff trying to sell a time share (now called a point system)also get quite cold when you don't buy a timeshare on the spot at their presentation but you get $75.00 for attending a 3 hr presentation. My time is worth more than that and I'm not inclined to spend $20,000 on the spot. Rainforest is across the street and there is lots to do. Usually a hugh massive cloud hanging over it. The wind keeps it blowing away from the resort.

They have a concierge booth to aid in vacation planning and they must get paid on commission because anytime you ask them a question they are trying to force some timeshare seminar down your throat even if you have already registered for it.

The breakfast buffet lay out that they boast is to die for, and when you die you should leave your remaining assets to the person that has to pick up the check. i personally think 35 dollars is a little to much to pay for breakfast per person. I have money to burn when i go on vacation but i would rather do it using a bic lighter not a flame thrower. I suggest that people when visiting puerto rico rent condos or stay in hotels with breakfast included. people read alot about PR and think that they need to stay inside of a resort and pay 200 per person to golf but in actuality driving and safety in puerto rico is not a worry (especially during the day) you can have a great day without being robbed by a resort that looks the part of 5 stars but has the service of a Walmart(and if you where to get robbed on the street you would probably still save more money then the resort). Its a good thing i know the area or i might be even more disappointed with this place. I couldnt imagine looking at my bill if i had ate every meal at the resort for 5 days.

Staff is very cordial and attentive. Check in is a breeze. we arrived via a very early flight and they allowed us in our room at 8:30 a.m....very rare for a hotel to offer. Complimentary upgrade to an ocean view suite, by my simply asking. Very willing to accomodate us. Room was very large but a little need of new paint and sprucing up. No frig or microwave unless you pay a daily fee for a frig. View was very nice. Palms somewhat blocked the ocean view, but it still was very nice. Very lush and manicured grounds. Adult pool is beautiful with waterfalls and private cabanas (to rent) while the children's pool had a nice waterslide. Outdoors was pretty quiet except at the kids pool area. Nice tiki bar and fire pit ( fire pit is not in use except weekends. Food and drinks are expensive. About 10-12.00 for a drink. Casino area is loud but you don't hear it from room or lobby. Very nice gift shop and again staff is very friendly. They have tours available at the concierge for the area. We stayed one night prior to cruise and two nights after the cruise. We will return to this hotel next year. Pay and valet parking. Good covered garage, with security. Real pretty place for a wedding. Didn't really mind the resort or parking fee, just comes with the fluff these kind of places add on. Did not use restaurants or bars. Need to rent a car in my opinion or you are stuck. Taxi's are more than a car rental for the day! Nice driving trip to the resort from the airport, just get good directions and watch out for the drivers! Locals are in a hurry, honk their horns ALOT, drive in the center of lane markers, turn right from a left lane and it goes on and on! Don't be that alarmed, just be on your toes!!! We ended up laughing a lot about it, during and after our trip. California and New York Cabby's have nothing on the P.R. drivers! El Yunque Rain Forest is really close. No charge to drive the rain forest. Take the drive, it may only be about 2 miles from the resort to start your drive and many stops along the way to see what the forest has to offer. I would personally skip the visitors center, anti-climactic, but the 8-10.00 visitors center entrance fee does help keep the place going. Nice gift shop as well. There are also gift shops and a couple snack bars and restaurants along side the road. I can see how a picnic lunch would be fun. The drive and stops take about an hour. You can see a lot from the side of the road and pull outs without having to hike around. From the hotel, you can get to restaurants, mall, fast food, K-Mart/Wal-Mart within 15 minutes. You feel so much freer if you have a car there. We rented from Charlie's. I hear it is one of the most recommended rental agencies from US travelers. We had a good experience. They have a few locations, and they will take or pick you up from the cruise ports and airport...at least they did for us at no additional fee.

It was a waste of money. Though there are a number of restaurant options on the resort, all of the food is the same, overpriced, and bad. It was only made tolerable by excessive drinking of overpriced alcohol. The resort is also so remote that without a car it requires a minimum of a $40 cab ride to the nearest decent restaurant. The resort offered no evening activities which left one to again consume overpriced alcohol in at the lobby bar or go to the tiny, tacky casino. The location of the resort is terrible. It is about 45 minutes from San Juan and the airport. It makes one feel trapped. Leaving the resort itself would be an uncomfortably long walk and once off the resort the area is not very pleasant. The only redeeming quality about this location is that it is close to El Yunque rainforest. The gym was merely adequate.

There is no lifeguard at either the beach or pools so you always have to be watching if you're traveling with children. The pools are small and overcrowded, even though there aren't many people. The restaurants have halfway decent food, but are way way way way way too overpriced. I got a club sandwich at Marbella (their cheapest restaurant) and it was $17. It wasn't even that good. Half of a grapefruit is $7. And the restaurants aren't the only thing that is expensive. Parking tops $15 a day. Oh, and even if you play golf, one round is $200, plus all the fees. Massages top $200 too, and is they say it's a 50 min massage, it's actually 40. The staff here is really unhelpful.

The hot tub is packed with kids as a result and people are poolside in long sleeve shirts sometimes! The rooms do smell musty, it must be the humidity.

The hotel has many quiet candle lit areas to sit around on beautiful big comfy velvety furniture. It has a mediterranean castle feel to it, lots of wrought iron. The staff was warm and welcoming.

Drinks were too expensive-10 dollars each-The for 2 for one rum punch at the Tiki bar after 4pm sounded good but tasted horrid! We brought our own booze and made our own drinks.We were glad we listened to reviews that suggested renting a car.Rent on your own before you get there. A shuttle from the airport, for 2, round trip is $160! We rented a car and toured the Rain Forest, Fajardo, Luquillo beaches and Old San Juan ( not far- a must see)for less that that! We had GPS on our phone and never got lost. I would only recommend \"La Parilla\" at the Kioskos, food and service was very good and cheap. Breakfast was a rip off at the hotel, so we ate at The bakery at the bottom of the hill. They make omelets etc.-cheap and good. The beach at the hotel was well groomed daily, but the water was too rough to swim in, lots of undercurrents. We went in only waist deep only. We would have loved to gone snorkeling or done water sports,but you can't here. That was a little disappointing to us,but If you like to golf, it's got a beautiful course! The resort was big enough so that they seem to put families with kids on one side and couples on the other, each with separate pool and jacuzzi areas-nice!

Some were great and some were not so good. Happy to say we just got back and had a fabulous time! The resort is really pretty. The grounds are lovely and well kept. Our room was fantastic and we received and upgrade to OceanFront on arrival. I think if you book through Zell Travel or GoGo you will get this if they have open rooms. Our room was clean, comfortable and no issues with air conditioning. They do put the AC on very cold but we just shut it off when we were in the room. I think with the humidity they have to keep the rooms cool to avoid mildew. The service was great. Check-in and check-out smooth. Staff really nice from the restaurants to the parking people, house keeping, Concierge. All were great. Resorts are generally expensive and take advantage of having you captive but I think you need to have this mindset going in and you won't be upset about parking fees, etc. The restaurants are a bit pricey but there are plenty of places to eat right outside the resort. You DEFINITELY need a car. Some good restaurants: La Parilla (One night it was great and one night ok) Ismar Bakery (Great for breakfast) Palmer Bakery Estacion in Fajardo Don Pepe Marmalade in Old San Juan (Fabulous food!!!!!) The resort is about 40 minutes from the airport and about an hour from OSJ. We used our car every day so it is definitely worth renting. If you want to book excursions, I recommend booking them before you arrive. They are expensive to book at the hotel (almost double the price). We used East Island Adventures for Snorkling and Bio Bay Tour. They are really great and reasonably priced. They are also one of the few excursions for snorkling that allow children under age 6. I have children 7 and 4. They loved Rio Mar. The pool is big and has a sllide that is really fun. They have tons of big iguanas walking around. They let the children feed them which is great fun. This resort is very kid friendly. All in all I thought it was a really nice place and would stay there again. If you want nightlife you should stay in Old San Juan or Condado. If you want family fun, relaxing stay here. It is a bit remote but if you have a car everything is close. There is a Walmart or Walgreens about 15 minutes away. We stocked up on drinks and snacks to bring down some of the expensive food cost. The rainforest is right across the road and Luquillo beach is about a 5 to 10 minute drive away.

The beach, pools, and casino are great because they have a fun energy without feeling overcrowded. If you want to stay outside of San Juan, I would absolutely say you should stay here. On a personal note, we had a life-changing experience on our trip during Thanksgiving week. To be more specific, it was almost a life-ending experience. We were caught in a riptide and pulled into the ocean, with very little hope. It was a matter of minutes until we would have died in that water. Through the heroic efforts of a surfer and a 21 year-old kid named Elijah who swam in after us, we were able to make it out. The jet ski rental place next door had an employee named Onyx who injured his knee in the rough conditions for the final rescue. It took the combined efforts of all these strangers to save our lives, and we will never be able to thank these people. The manager of the hotel is a lady named Zandra. She, like so many of the Puerto Rican people we met, is a remarkable human being. The last thing I needed after this ordeal was to talk to some unfeeling corporate voice. Zandra was anything but that. She is a great asset to the Wyndham name. We will never forget our time at the Rio Mar and in Puerto Rico.

In fact I'm unable to come up with much criticism at all; I felt completely at ease in a place where staff went out of their way to both give you attention and privacy at the same time. I get easily bored on vacation if things are not happening, but I was content to stay on the property for days w/o feeling a need for extra stimulus. If you are on a budget, there's places around where you can find cheaper meals and supplies. The kioskos in Luquillo, the Brass Cactus in the same town and food stands along the road. The places very close to the resort tend to be pricey, so I'd either venture a couple a miles away or spring for the restaurants on site. Palio at the resort is a good Italian restaurant by any standard. If you only have 3-5 days in PR, I'd stay 1-2 at the resort, 1 day in El Yunque rain forest and one full day in Old San Juan.

Lush and lovely gardens, interesting art, nice fresh flowers take the prize, but like a high-maintenance beauty queen it comes at a price. In the case of the Wyndam it is the confiscatory parking rates, mandatory bellman and housekeeping gratuities, inexcusably poor maintenance of the rooms, and service you don't get without nagging. Hospitality, after all, is much more about comfort than good looks. The first room they gave us smelled so strongly of mildew we couldn't stand to be there and lacked the wi-fi we were promised. After a whole day of wrangling the internet problem (instead of the sightseeing planned) with repeated promises and brief but ineffective intervention by the manager on duty, they finally admitted the internet service was down in the entire wing, and they knew it, and they were not planning to fix it. Instead they moved us into a room with the wi-fi that cooled to no higher than 66. When the engineer arrived to fix it, he suggested that we didn't know how to operate the thermostat, then pulled out a filthy filter, which my husband suggested should be changed, and then it took him an hour to return with the replacement. In the meantime, opening the balcony door caused immediate condensation on everything and made the floors dangerous. Then, it was when I came out of the shower, wet all over, and trying to get to the conference on time, that I discovered that the hair dryer was dead. My complaints to management were met with semi-sincere empathy and we were granted a complimentary very late check-out and small credit. The special check-out was so time-consuming and delay so great, the fault of poor coordination between the front desk and valet parking attendants, that we missed the closing time for the cruise-area car rental office and had to return the car to the airport, pay a taxi to get to the ship, and nearly missed the deadline for boarding the ship. Even some of the conference arrangements were poorly conceived. For example, box lunches requiring both hands to manage were served to the hundreds of conference attendees, but on the first day there were only a couple dozen places to sit to eat it.

The Bell Desk helped with plenty of tips on the resort and places to eat around the hotel. Be prepared, you will have to pay $15/day for parking. One tip I cant stress enough: RESERVE YOUR CAR RENTAL BEFORE YOU ARRIVE AT THE RESORT. You will need it because the hotels location is so remote from all of the attractions and cabs are pricey. I booked my rental and paid less than $150 for the week. We met another couple that booked their rental through the hotel and paid more than $275. That's on top of the cab fare. Below are a few helpful tips I wish I would've known before the trip. On the way to the hotel, make sure you have have toll fare. We accidentally drove into the wrong lane which requires $1.50 in exact change only (in coins). Needless to say, we didnt have it and held up the line and were greeted with loud horns and dirty looks. Lanes marked with a blue C can break bills for you. GPS is crap in PR. The workers at the hotel will agree with me on this. We arrived in PR pretty late in the evening so everything is that much harder to see. We got lost and we extremely frustrated. Locals were nice enough to point us in the right direction. Be careful driving at night to the resort. The drive up to the resort after seeing the sign is windy and dark. Cars zip by pretty fast so prepare your defensive driving skills. Oh and no one uses their signal light in PR. Slow driving using hazard lights are the norm too. Seek assistance from the concierge but we careful with the people that are over-friendly and try to offer you free tours. It's the time-share ploy! I've done that once in Mexico and I'll never do it again. A firm \"No\" will suffice and they wont bother you again. The concierge desk has directions to everywhere. Just ask them. They'll provide you with a print out instead of having you jot everything down. Also, ask them for the list of dinner reservations. Most of them were good. Places we loved: Parilla, Brass Cactus, A few of the kiosks in Luquillo (be careful and make sure to inspect your food, a few of the items from the kiosks were spoiled). The one we hated: Hacienda Carabali. If you see the nice man selling candy in his truck, BUY IT! He's only there on the weekends. Do not book the El Yunque tour if you have a car.

However, we were upgraded to a seventh floor ocean view room with comfortable bed/bedding, large bath with plenty of hot water, balcony, and plenty of storage space. We bought a small styrofoam cooler and used it for drinks and snacks while there. Definitely rent a car and a GPS to get around - this place IS about 45 min from airport and Old San juan. There are Walgreens, grocery stores and fast food every 5 miles or so. The beach is great, as are the pools. Restaurants are fairly pricey but good food. In general, everyone we met in San Juan was super helpful and friendly. You can get free internet if you join Wyndham By Request at the website. Parking IS $15/day. Old San Juan with forts, etc. is worth a day or two. Lovely squares to hang out in, a free trolley so that you can leave your car in a parking garage, and shopping if you wish. Don't forget an umbrella or poncho - the rain comes from all directions and can be sudden. In comparison to Mexico destinations, I felt safer here, there was more English spoken if that's important to you, and it seemed much cleaner. Leave plenty of time at the airport on your departure day...if a cruise ship has come in, it will be a zoo, and you must put your bags through a USDA scanner if coming to the US.

We traveled 3 days early to enjoy the island before work began. We could not have had a better experience. The Rio Mar is Paradise. The grounds are beautiful, the staff are wonderful and attentive. The room was very clean and comfortable. The room we shared was on the second floor. Apparently the lower floors tend to be a bit more humid so there was a dehumidifier in the room. We thought the sound of the machine was annoying at first and started to request a room higher up but after the first night we decided we liked the low humming of it and decided to stay in the room the rest of our visit. It also was very convenient to the pool, beach and casino. The beach is beautiful and the location of the resort is in close proximity of the rain forest, snorkeling, sailing and what ever sight seeing you might want to do; or you can just stay on the property. The food at the resort is mediocre and definately over priced, but the beauty that surrounds you at the resort more than makes up for it. You can go to the kiosks on Hwy 3 for much less expensive fare. We got an ice chest and made our own drinks in our room along with some snacks. RUM is very cheap! Fortunately the conference we attended provided a couple of breakfast and lunches through out the week. There is a restaurant at the top of the hill called Ritchie's that has had some negative reviews. We decided to try it anyway and I can say we had a ball. Yes, the food is WAY over priced but, again, the amount of fun we had MORE than made up for it. We loved the Rio Mar and would definitely, and plan to, go again. I would say that for most people who are looking for a relaxing vacation this would be the place. If you are a young person interested in a lot of partying I would recommend staying in Old San Juan or a different type of resort. If you plan on sight seeing, definitely rent a car. The Dragonfly tours offered at the hotel are expensive. We went on a boating, snorkeling, beach day. The other people on the boat had paid 150.00 each for the excursion through Dragonfly. We drove ourselves about 15 minutes and paid 69.00 for the same excursion from the East Island boating excursions. You can hike the rain forest trails yourself. There is a visitor center and they provide maps for free. The Bacardi Rum Factory tour is free if you drive yourself. We checked that out and it was very interesting. Old San Juan, is the same, you can do it yourself if you have a car and just pay for parking at the parking garage or find a space on the street if you are lucky. If you do rent a car do not rent from PAYLESS car rental. Go with Enterprise or Hertz. Payless is a bunch of con artists, I won't go into it but Trust Me, stay away from them. Driving is a bit of a challenge, traffic is horrible and the roads are just as bad, but as I said, well worth it. OH, the Hotel will charge you 15.00 a day for self parking. That was the biggest negative we had about the place. We did sneak into the employees parking lot a couple of nights, but for the most part we just sucked it up and paid the fee.

Great facility, clean rooms, beautiful pools and beach. But it is very far away from everything. And they know its far from everything, so they can charge you a fortune for food, drinks, excursions, cab rides, rental cars, etc. I would recommend staying in Old San Juan where you can walk to restaurants and shops. If you choose to stay at the Wyndham, be prepared to spend a lot more than you would elsewhere. We brought snacks and a few bottles of alcohol with us and still ended up spending much more than we planned. The food at the resort is good, just expensive. You can probably get away with splitting an appetizer and one entree between 2 people (we did). I would HIGHLY recommend renting a car, and you would be smart to book it before you arrive. Our vacation really didn't start until we rented a car on day 4 and got to experience the culture, see the sites and the people and eat the amazing Puerto Rican food. When we tried to rent a car at the Enterprise kiosk at the hotel, they offered us a rate of $75 per day for the Smart car, which was almost too small to hold our shopping bags on the way back from Old San Juan!!! I ended up calling the 800# for Enterprise and got a much better rate. You should also be aware that when you rent a car, you have to pay $15 per day for parking! Puerto Rico is a wonderful island! We did the Yunke Zipline Adventure (www.yunkezipline.wordpress.com) and absolutely loved the experience and our tour guides! It was amazing! We also did the Bio Bay Tour, which was pretty incredible too! I would not recommend booking through the hotel. You can save some money by calling and booking on your own, but you'll need a car or cab to get there. Our favorite restaurants were Pasta y Pueblo on the beach in Luquillo and Boricuba in Fajardo. The food was delicious; I recommend the Mofongo! The Islamar Bakery at the bottom of the hill has amazing omelets and baked goods. Be careful about taking the cab drivers recommendations for restaurants! I think they get a kick-back from the restaurant owners, and I believe some of the restaurants increase the prices when the cab driver tips them off. Our cab driver sold us on a restaurant called Don Pepe at the bottom of the hill near Islamar. When we agreed to go, he called ahead (in Spanish) and talk to the owner. When we got there, they gave us menus from a different stack which had very high prices. Stay at this resort at your own risk!

Walked everyday along the beach path. 2 golf couses, very well maintained. The staff everywhere was super friendly and very accommodating. Rooms are very clean, neat and comfortable.

Don't be nervous. It's an awesome place to stay, but you should know a few things that will make your stay more comfortable. The rooms are chilly to avoid getting too humid. Just be prepared and bring sweats and a long sleeve shirt if you intend on hanging out in the room the whole time. It's comfortable while sleeping. If you try to warm up the room, it will be too humid as several people noted. Just use your head. It's common sense. As for parking, it's just what it is. But, if you stay at this resort, you really do need a rental car. It was worth the money just in savings on the side trips. If you set up your side trips on your own and have your own transportation, you save about 30%. For example, the ATV ride through the rain forest was $112 through the resort, but only $70 through the place directly. To save some money, we rented a mini fridge from the resort and went to the store to get food and liquor. That probably saved us $1000 total. You can bring your own cooler down to the pool, but you'll probably have to get ice from the bartender. There is only one ice machine that puts out much ice, and that is on the 4th floor. The pool and beach are amazing, and the tiki bar is really great. The food isn't perfect at the tiki bar, but we found that the fried chicken sandwich was probably the best sandwich choice. When we went (slow season) not all of the restaurants were open every night, but we did find something good to eat every night. We ate at Fajardo's marina one night, the kiosks one night, and Raice's in San Juan one night. You have to try the mofongo there. We also ate at the cafe quite a bit. Overall, the negative reviews come from the people who are not using common sense to save money and have a comfortable room. Just use your head and it will be an amazing trip. We had no trouble with the staff, but we did find that people told us the pool was open 24/7, and it really closed at about 2 a.m. one night. Just FYI. Side trips we recommond are the bio bay tour, ATV through the rain forest, snorkeling Culebra, and a visit to old San Juan. I'm sure there are many more fun things to do, but this is all we could squeeze in. I'd go back in a heartbeat. If you want a place that is near bars and nightlife - stay somewhere in San Juan.

We really lucked out with the weather thank God!! There's not a lot I can add to the other reviews... definitely rent a car (take or rent a gps!!) and eat off premises (except for lunch at the tiki bar is very nice and what a view!!). Richies was great for drinks/appetizers and Antojitos was great for breakfast. The bakery next door was just ok and same for the Luqillo kiosks - most are dumps except for La Parilla was very nice but a little pricey. Also further into Luquillo Pasta Y Pueblo was fantastic and the Brass Cactus was also very good. I would HIGHLY recommend both over the kiosks. Highlights for me were: 1) Hiking to/going under La Mina falls 2) Mini-boats 3) Walking around Old San Juan - very cool city - and the tasting tour!! 4) Laying around at the adult pool at Wyndham - very relaxing and beautiful!! The most disappointing/over-rated for me would be: 1) Roads/traffic/signage are all terrible 2) Luquillo kiosks 2) Candado/Isla Verde - not worth a special drive from Rio Mar IMO (plus we got lost - the signage is terrible!!). All in all I thought this was a great place to stay and we had a blast in PR!! The beach and pools are very nice, the rooms are big and beds very comfortable, the employees very helpful - they allowed us to check in early and check out late w/out any extra fees, it is close to the rain forest, Luquillo and Fajardo.

I thought this was a little high considering what we paid to stay here. By Thursday night, the lot was full of casino goers and the parking got a little hairy. I felt that those just visiting the casino should not be allowed to park in the same area as the guests because this was a great inconvienence for those of us staying there all week.

The really good: the high spot of this hotel is the lobby bar, where Leeza, Juan, and Cici are very attentive, friendly, and serve as wonderful food and drink hosts throughout the evening.

Guestroom corridor carpets are very stained and worn, and I had to visit five ice machines on three floors to find one that actually worked. Hello, Maintenance?? Mediocre, part two: Staff. In an operation like this, indifference or just plain bad service is bred from the top and at the Wyndham Not-So Grand, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evident. When great service can overcome mediocre offerings at a hotel, why do the bell staff members and lunch-time restaurant staff at this hotel seem intent on avoiding all eye contact, and not going out of their way at all to offer hospitality? The front desk staff are OK, the lobby bar staff great, and everyone else very much needs a bit of training to remind them how to make guests feel welcomed and appreciated. The most laughable staff episode was the front desk person who told my colleagues and me, at 6:50 AM, that we could not have that day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complementary USA Today because she was told not to put them out for distribution until 7:00 each morning!

I see a $2.68 daily \u00e2\u20ac\u0153housekeeping gratuity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd even though I tipped on my own daily, and since when did a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gratuity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd become a mandated, taxed charge? And then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the 14% daily \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort service fee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which amounted to $9.73 each day as a way to grab even more money from my pocket for services and amenities I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use.

Well-operated hotels have finally eliminated these bogus fees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too bad Wyndham Not-So Grand can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see their way toward including these charges in the room rate, or negating them altogether. Indifferent management: a malfunctioning smoke alarm in my room that sounded at 4:15 on each of two mornings during my visit, which I reported the first day and following the second day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s episode, no one could find any record of it being reported or addressed the day before; lack of foresight to offer guests a route to the restaurant inside the hotel when heavy rain and wind would soak any guest who tried to make it to the restaurant through their standard exterior corridors; and no one seeming to monitor lack of staff at key areas of the hotel during a large group visit. Money-saving tips: If you are traveling with others, rent a car for the 45 minute trip from the airport. At $40 per person, each way, for shuttle service, renting a car is easily the more economical choice. And for a great, local dinner at reasonable prices, head to the Hacienda Restaurant, a casual steak and fish restaurant located on a working ranch 10 minutes from the hotel.

The location is great for seeing the north east corner of PR. We live on the south side of the island so took the opportunity to visit El Yunque on day of arrival. Ate down the road at Antejitos (typical PR food - good service). The next day we got up early and went on a 2 hr ATV tour with hacienda carabali. This was fantastic - all the guides were excellent and we had a great time. The trail was a lot of fun and they made several stops so we can take photos and had dip in the river. Our 8 year old girl had \"the most fun ever\"! She Also went on the go carts with my husband and enjoyed that a lot too. Lunch was good there and I would definitely recommend this option. The afternoon was spent back at the hotel in the pools and on the slide (which oddly closes at 5pm) and on the beach. Hired a wave runner for half an hour - again lot of fun but not cheap. We enjoyed the hotel overall - I was a little hesitant after some of the reviews but basically we booked at 48 hrs notice blindly (using the travelocity 'super secret hotel' option for the first time). in short though I knew there were only 2 four star hotels in rio grande so thought it might be this one. We had a room on rainforest side on 6th floor - very comfortable and no problems with damp. although this might be an issue on lower floors I also suspect it is more weather related (since I live here) - you are next to the rainforest after all!

Our sons enjoyed the go carts but their favorite was driving their own ATV through the rain forest and leaping off a rocky cliff into a river.

Drinks and meals are VERY expensive at the resort. #4-We did not eat at the resort at all. The best local restaurants are; La Parilla (luquillo kiosk) El Jeffe Burger (luquillo kiosk) and Pasta Y Pueblo (luquillo beach). These places do not have A/C and are not fancy but the food is outstanding. Pasta Y Pueblo was the BEST by far. Go early, they only have 4 tables in a beach side shack. The bakery at the bottom of the road to the resort is great and cheap too. #5-do not book excursions through the hotel. Venture out on your own or online and you will pay half the price. The beach is beautiful and not crowded. The grounds were clean, well maintained and beautiful. Our room was quiet and beds were extra comfy! The service at the resort was fantastic. Our room was too cold and they sent someone to fix it, twice. They promptly relocated us to an upgraded room happily. No problems here with service. #6-be prepared to tip nicely. They do have great service so please tip the workers. They knock on your door and ask if you need fresh towels!! We had a wonderful time and I would stay there again and again. Just be prepared and you too will have a great time. No one should go to a large resort such as this one and assume it will be cheap.

We rented a car, ate most of our meals off the resort and did our own booking of excursions except for one through the hotel for horseback riding. The cost was the same as if we booked directly. The trip from the airport to the hotel was easy and once we arrived the resort was beautiful, better than the pictures on-line. We had booked 5 rooms and asked for them close together. We arrived around 10:30 a.m. so rooms were not ready. We started getting rooms between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. All on the same floor, the 6th with a view of the rainforest. We went to the market, Amigos, just a couple miles away and bought a foam cooler for 3 dollars. Filled it with soda, water, beer and rum. Because of all this we really enjoyed the resort because we did not have alot of the extra costs others had and were able to get around freely. The resort really is lovely. The grounds are very tropical with the sound of the coqui all around at night. The pools were great and as long as you got pool towels before 6:00 p.m. when the towel stand closed you could stay at the pools until midnight. We also went into the ocean every evening until it got dark. If you ran your hands through the sand you came out with handfuls of live sand dollars. I had never even seen a live sand dollar before. To round out each evening we would go into the casino. Our trip was on a budget so my limit for casino money was $ 30.00 per night. 3 out of 5 nights I won, nothing huge but made it fun. We also got a big kick out of the iguanas, never saw them at the pool areas but everywhere else yes, they even had a feeding time and gave out lettuce. As far as service I found everyone very helpful and quick to respond to any request. They even supplied me with maps to any place I requested which made traveling around very easy. They also had computers in the lobby if you needed to look up something on-line.

I wanted to provide a little bit of information to those heading to rio mar. Just so those of you going can feel a little more comfortable, here are some recommendations that i wish someone told me before going...To begin, be sure to keep your baggage claim ticket (the little sticker) with you at all times. SJU airport will not allow you to leave the airport with your bags without it! Rent a car online before you go and be sure to get a number for them and call them when you land so that a shuttle will come get you...otherwise you might be standing for a while!! Cabs and the hotel charge outragious prices for rides...like $60 one way. Be very careful when driving especially at night since most of the roads have no lane divider lines and the locals drive crazy. (get the extra insurance!) i rented from a company call U-SAVE and paid around $200 for the entire week.. Hotel- Very nice but the parking garage is a bit trashy with stray dogs fighting for garbage! pool is very nice but watch out for the iguanas, they are harmless but everywhere. Excursions- 1. I recommend going to the rainforest and swimming in the waterfall, that was a highlight of our trip. 2. Old San Juan and bacardi distillery 3. catamaran sail and snorkel 4. bio bay kayak trip 5. beaches in Fajardo!! nice waves only about 6 miles east of the resort on Hwy. 3. 6. eating at kiosk #9...there are about 60 right down the road on hwy 3 east. 7. only eat at Richies if you want a great view but the weather needs to be nice. food was overpriced. The reasons i recommend renting a car is b/c the hotel wants to charge you like $45 per person just to take you to the rainforest when you can drive their in ten minutes for free..each excursions is like this, all you have to do is call them to reserve and then drive yourself. Also you can go to wal mart or walgreens and get snacks and drinks for a fraction of the price they charge you at the hotel..just get a styrofoam icechest and use the ice at the hotel.....", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liberty, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort, but with hidden expenses\u201d", "Author": "Shopgirl985", "ReviewID": "UR74954226", "Content": "The Rio Mar is a beautiful beach front resort located on hundreds of lush, beautifully landscaped acres.

I'll start with the positive (since it's such a short list)-- the bed is comfortable and it's a nice quiet place TO SLEEP, the property itself is pretty nice in itself and the golf course is insanely huge and beautiful (tho we don't golf), SOME of the staff is really nice and the service request girl answers the phone before it even rings, and the beach is pretty nice. Now the bad: Rent a car because this place will Nickle and dime u every chance they get, so save money and be less irritated eat elsewhere and hangout elsewhere case in point to re-heat my food ( there are no microwaves anywhere and the hotel charges $15 to reheat or heat anything if you didn't buy it here and there are NO refrigerators in the rooms they're a $20 daily charge). If u want a covered are at the pool that's a charge too(don't know how much bcuz wasn't paying for that either way!) my ocean view room that I paid an extra $350 is a building and pool view and u can only see the ocean if u step out into the balcony and look to the left. Parking is $15 a day for guests!! Concierge is NOT HELPFUL AT ALL!!! We spent three hours trying to book a ziplining tour and the asst manager had to come out and do their job. So now suggestions on how to avoid all the problems we've had the last two day ( and well write another review when our trip is done) : 1. Rent a car 2. Bring or purchase a cooler bag and ziploc bags to fill with ice and put in coooler bag daily therefore ur refrigerator. And know there IS A WALMART about 10-15 min from here 3. Book ur adventures/tours/excursions BEFORE you come because concierge is useless and will waste ur vacation time AND hotel prices are $35 and MORE PER PERSON GREATER THAN THEY ARE BOOKING YOURSELF. If you plan or want to do ziplining in el yunque like we wanted know there is only ONE company who does it at the rainforest. And book them before you leave for here because they were sold out for the solid week while we are here: yunque zipline 787-242-3368 and if ur unable to book with them as we were we found ON OUR OWN EcoQuest(which has great tripadvisor reviews btw) and the girl Erica was very patient and helpful number 787-529-2496. In my opinion this resort only deserves 3-3.5 stars max. And in day two of our vacation there have been enough problems that we've concluded that we won't be coming back here if we ever do puerto Rico again. On a positive note the island is beautiful(and we have much more to see ) and the local people have been really nice we've been having a great time except for when we're at the resort the room is an average room with a very average one sinked bathroom and a standard tub and shower combination there's nothing extraordinary about the room and the furniture is average so overall it's clean enough to sleep and stay but don't expect much else without feeling ripped off. The grounds ARE kept up pretty well from what we've seen and the walk on the beach was peaceful pools average but there IS A WATERSLIDE at one pool :). Will update if the stay gets any better.

Like the title says though, it is what you make it. If you have already booked this hotel and are worried because of the mixed reviews....don't be. I was guilty of that and was pleasantly surprised. That being said here is all you need to know upfront. Rent a car, if you don't you will wish you had. The parking (if you are a guest) is 15.00 to self park and 20.00 for the valet. We did the valet. I was on vacation and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of self parking. If you are worried about driving in PR don't be. It is no different then driving in any major U.S. city. Getting to the resort from the airport is easy. PR26 to 66 to 3 if you want to pay a toll and save about 15 minutes. If you don't want to pay the toll then it's 26 to 3. Bring your GPS it helped us out a lot. Book all the tours you want...just not through the hotel. If you have a car you can book your own tours or self tour. We drove through the rain forest, hiked it, and did all the tourist stuff on our own. We met one couple on a trail to one of the waterfalls that had left their guide because he talked to much. We drove to Old San Juan ourselves(again not hard). Get a map from the concierge and follow the directions on the back. They will take you directly to a parking garage. We were there several hours and paid under 5 dollars. We also did one of the bio bay tours. I booked through one of the operators in my guidebook and it was 45 dollars per person. They gave us directions and we drove ourselves out there. The hotel wanted 99 dollars a person for this tour. Be sure you do this by the way. It was incredible not just for the glowing blue water, but for the experience of seeing what happens when you put 30 people, most of whom have no idea what they are doing, into kayaks at night, in pitch black dark and tell them to follow the leader....it was hilarious. That's all I will say about that. The reason you want to save money by booking your own tours is because as every other reviews states this place is expensive. I knew that going in and promised my wife I would not mention money once, it was hard. The truth is the prices are high but you have to know the secrets. Drinks-beer is cheaper at the tiki bar then the lobby bar. Medella, the local beer is cheaper than the rest and very drinkable. It is also 2 for 1 at the Tiki bar during happy hour making it a very reasonable 2.50 a can. Most liquor drinks are going to be about 10 bucks. They do have daily drink specials that can save you money. Rum punch was like 6.50 I think during happy hour and they would make it with 151. . During the day we made/brought our own drinks. Using our rental car we went to the grocery store (Amigo) and bought beer, snacks, and rum. The rum was dirt cheap there with decent bottles from 7-11 dollars. We also bought coke and coolers and for less then the price of one hours worth of drinks we were set up for the whole week. I never drank there before happy hour and saved a ton of money. Food- It is ok and depending on where you are from or where you are used to staying the food reviews will change dramatically. Breakfast, I didn't waste my money on. We bought croissants at the grocery store. Lunch, if you have to eat there is going to run you about 15 dollars a person before drinks. The food is decent but you are paying high end resort prices. If you have a car go out and get something from a roadside stall some place. Dinner, when we didn't leave the resort we either ate room service (not too unreasonable) or at the Italian place. If you live somewhere with a large Italian, or thinks they are Italian, population then you will hate this place and complain about it to everyone at the bar. If you are not one of those people then the restaurant isn't that bad. I have paid more, for worse Italian food and service. I enjoyed it, it was quiet, the service was good, and they had a couple of wines on special that we not as overpriced as the rest. You can get out of there with drinks and dessert for 80 dollars if you are smart about it. Where we live 80 dollars for dinner is not bad. Just a note about Riches to. It is up the hill and has a great view. It is easy to find because Richie has no fewer than 300 signs within five square miles of the hotel. The food is good but crazy expensive. If you have a car go for a drink and an appetizer to enjoy the view. Don't eat dinner there unless you really want to. The food there was about 30% more than the tourist restaurants in San Juan. Rooms-they were fine, not great, but fine. I didn't smell any damp, and I looked all over the place but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find any mold. The A/C did just what we asked it to do, and the maid service was perfect. We had a rain forest view on the 6th floor. I recommend that you try to get as high as you can, so you can see something. We had a family with four kids next to us and we never heard them. The only time I could hear other people was when I was out on the balcony. Please folks, if you are going to yell at each other in anger or during \"other times\" close your balcony door. I honestly can only giggle at you for so long before I get annoyed. Service- no one ever offered me a timeshare. The concierge didn't like it when I asked for a map and not a tour. Other than that everyone was super friendly. The waitstaff was great when we ate, the bartenders were super friendly. Visit \"big\" Jose at the Tiki bar, you can't miss him and he will always remember what drinks you want. Fraliza(I might have misspelled this) at the lobby bar was always willing to help us figure out what to do while we were there. They all seemed to really care that we had a good time and enjoyed their island. The result was, we did. The beach is fine. It is not a pristine Caribbean beach, and it does not compare to any. It is a beautiful beach on the Atlantic. For those of you who frequent the Atlantic you will understand this. There was never a shortage of chairs or umbrellas. They have to pick up the chairs at 5 o'clock this time of year because of the sea turtles, that is a local law. I always saw people swimming until well after that though. The pools are way to small but as far as I could tell were open all night. We did late night swimming and were not the only ones out there. The adult pool had kids in it because their parents are the type that think they are better than everyone else and don't have to follow the rules. If you are one of these people, then I don't like you. If you like lounging by endless pools... go to Sandals, this is more of a beach place. Lots of kids, if you don't want kids go to Sandals. Overall had a good time. Clear your mind. If money is a concern and if it is going to bother you then don't go here. There are better deals out there and nothing ruins a vacation like worrying about money. Understand it going in, if you have to save money follow the reviews here like we did, and you will have a great time. Oh yeah, last thing. The casino is a huge rip off. The slots are tight, and the table games are empty. If you want to gamble find some guys playing dice in an alley....your odds will be better.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice resort\u201d", "Author": "droman2010", "ReviewID": "UR74396180", "Content": "We purchased points as part of a timeshare \"trial period\" and used some of the points here for a weekend getaway with our cousins.

Have to have your parking ticket validated at the concierge, even if you self-park. Rooms were nice- we had adjacent rooms with our cousins with a common door, but the rooms have thin walls and we could here if the 'discussion' next door got above a whisper. Rooms were a nice size, clean with good housekeeping services. Got to see iguanas from our hotel room balcony, and our view was to die for! The resort is large and could get noisy so if you are a lite sleeper you may want to stay on a higher floor. Had live entertainment in the lobby. It's right on the beach, and quite beautiful. 24 hour outdoor jacuzzi was awesome. Nice pools, but too crowded. Has a restaurant on site but was out of our price range, so can't comment to quality. We ate at more affordable places in the city. They have water equipment for rent, which we rented the kayak, which was fun until someone turned too fully and turned it upside down! My cousin was hit in the head with the kayak, but thankfully nothing serious happened since there's no lifeguards and there wasn't any staff around. Small area with a few computers with internet for everyone to use- I never had to wait to use one. El Yunque Rainforest was about a 30 minute drive from the resort.

First the good: the beaches were nice and well maintain as was the pool. The hotel aside from being a little dated was clean. The food was decent and the wait staff was generally friendly and attentive. We used the shuttle service from the airport. When we got off the plane we were greeted by a representitive from the hotel and our bags were taken to the shuttle. We had to leave early in the morning for our return and the driver was there waiting for us. It was very user friendly. My wife used the Spa and was pleased with it. Like all Spas it was exspensive. Now the bad: From what I could gather the air conditioning in the rooms did not draw the moisture out of the room. We opened the door to the balconey ( beautiful view) and withing seconds the whole room was fogged up and every surface was wet. We knew it was because of the differance in tempature from inside to out. But after hours the moisture was still there. As time went on it got worse instead of better. By morning we actually had a visable puddle on the floor. The made mopped it up but by the evening the second day it was back. As you might imagine the bed linens drew moisture as well so we slept in a wet bed. I did not get much sleep during our stay and my wife developed a sore throat. The food was decent as I stated before but it was not nearly worth what we paid for it. We did not have a car so we had to bare it. Pluse we were on vacation so we did not let in bother us. I think that the two things that irritated me the most was the fact that the would not let us use the lounges on the beach after five o'clock so we moved to the pool only to find out that it also closed at dusk and we could not use it either. The pool bar also closed at five which left only the bar in the lobby to get a drink. Drinks were very expensive. $15 for a patron margarita and $10 for most mixed drinks. The casino was lacking but that was because they did not have enough buisness to keep enough of the games open. We didn't go there for that so it was not a big deal. If they fixed the A/C, lowered the prices a little bit and kept the pool open longer it would be a really good place to stay.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barranquitas, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cGood but...\u201d", "Author": "PicapiedraPR", "ReviewID": "UR73683998", "Content": "food is HIGHLY overpriced, and parking lot is a mess.

We parked the car ourselves, saves you 5 dollars a day - $20 valet parking and $15 self parking - ( if you are going to Rio Mar DO RENT a car!). The employees at the parking don't speak English at all. I tried my poor Spanish but after the 3rd day I just pretended I couldn't understand them, once they are VERY annoying. We had no problems to check-in besides the long waiting line and the slow service to check in. We got a room on the 7th floor with mountain view, normal size room. Bathroom doesn't have fan, the ventilation is VERY loud and so is the plumbing. Every time the room aside of us used the bathroom we could hear it. Once you keep your balcony door closed, you have no problems with humidity. The pools were great, adult pool separated from kids pool and they don't allow kids in the adult pool. We saw the iguanas at the adult pool one day, they are big but if you don't get too close they don't bother you (I preferred stay away and we went to the beach that day).Beach was good, although a little dirty (empty cups and cigarettes ends everywhere). The water was amazing! Food at the hotel is EXTREMELY expensive. My husband and I paid $10/day for one small coffee and one small cappucino. I saw a lady paying over $58 for two donuts, two bagels with cream cheese, coffee and a bottle of water. I read some people saying good things about Richie's on the top of the hill, we checked it and found out its too expensive for the quality of food (They try to Americanize it and in the end has no flavor or special feeling). We found a place located on PR3 towards Fajardo where they have lots of kioskes (go during the day, at night may be a little too shady) and we went to Congas, AMAZING FOOD for a very reasonable price!! We went to a sales presentation and received a free massage at the hotel spa. Terrible massage by the way. You always have the option of choosing discounts or vouchers for the hotel. Employees in general are not very friendly and treat you with some attitude. Parking is extremely unorganized, each day we parked in a different area of the hotel, some days they gave us parking ticket, some days you don't even see the employees at all. Casino is kind of small, and smells like incense (yuck!). The computer area was working for the first day, after that they took ALL the computers at once to fix and when we left they weren't back yet. If you have Wyndham Rewards and paid for the trip through an agency you are not allowed to use your rewards for free wifi ($10/ day per room). Once the computers weren't working, I just took my laptop to the computer area and hooked it up to the internet cable. Free internet with my personal computer! :) The hotel was quieter during the week than on the weekend... Too loud music and people during the weekend. It was a nice place, but I've been to cheaper hotels with a better service.... About the activities, we booked our zip line adventure through Yunke Zipline Adventure, they don't answer their phones, no confirmation email, terrible service. We had to cancel. We then did the ATV in the rain forest with Dragonfly through the hotel, $195 for double ATV, if you book yourself you pay about $40 less, but it was a last minute deal, so... We also did scuba diving (Scuba discover, through Sea Ventures in Fajardo), they were awesome!!!

Upon check in, I requested if it would be possible to be placed in a room with a view or at least one of their better rooms. This vacation was a special occasion and we were staying 4 nights. The woman at the front desk assured me I had a \"really nice room\" while handing me the key card. Instead of stepping into what I thought was going to be a \"really nice room\" I was hit with a wall of humidity/wetness and bad musty smell. I don't mean the tropical humidity that one could expect when traveling, I mean the room floor was damp, the counters were wet and it smelled musty. It had been raining for weeks in PR so I thought my standard room (without a great view) was normal to smell and feel humid. We had the worst night of sleep because of the lack of ventilation in our room. As I looked up at the ceiling after a horrible night's sleep, I saw black mold covering the ceiling of our room! We immediately packed and I requested to speak with a manager. The hotel manager was very kind and apologetic He changed our rooms as well as the other couple we were traveling with so we could be close to one another. Our next room was bigger and didn't have mold or a bad smell but our friend's room was a bit smelly. They didn't want to pack and move again so we all just dealt with it. What was most frustrating is the manager didn't offer anything for our inconvenience! No room credit, no discount on meals, no free parking... not even a free round of their expensive pina colada's! I've been traveling all my life but I guess sleeping in mold doesn't qualify for anything except the aggrevation of packing and changing to another room. TIP: if you are in a room where everything stays wet and it smells - check for black mold. Another huge upset - upon checking out, we received our bill which had a $100 credit listed on it. At that time I thought the hotel manager was being generous and gave us a free nights stay. Nope! The front desk never informed us of this credit upon check in and unless we used it for food and/or beverage, it would go to waste. So, instead of our huge bar tab that we paid cash for, we could have used the $100 hotel credit. I'm quite certain this was done on purpose. Why have the hotel come out of pocket for food and beverage when they already display very little gratitude towards their guests? The only positive aspect of staying at this hotel was the pool and beach. The iguana's and sound of coquis everywhere was relaxing and fun. Although one day I asked a staff member if someone could do a quick skim of the pool due to debris but no one bothered to show up. This was after two requests. Staying on their cell phone and ignoring the request was much more important than assisting a guest. With all my traveling and stays at the Marriott, not once have I experienced this much lack of regard towards guests. It is a good thing my next 4 days in PR was spent at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan. I wished I had stayed 2 nights at this place and 6 at Caribe Hilton. The staff at the Hilton went out of their way to make sure guests were well taken care of.

I had to cancel my dinner reservation.

Although communication with the block sales department was spotty months ago (the first agent we worked with no longer worked there, so there was some confusion about the block package but all that was worked out), our guests were all positive about the stay at the hotel, even our very well-traveled guests with great taste. Casino - small but decent. Nearly everyone I know who played won. The weekends were more happening, but there were only a few tables open during the weeknights, and even if there were people standing around wanting to play, no new tables were opened. Take a cooler with your own drinks because there was only one waitress getting drink orders and she never brought me my order. Pool - kids' pool has a slide and is right next to the adults' pool, which was great for us to be able to see everyone as we walked around. The Tiki Bar had good food but was really slow for lunch. I never really saw any waiters taking drink orders around the pool, so we brought our own coolers filled with beer and water and I don't think anyone said anything to us. They frequently ran out of towels on the weekend, but otherwise each room can get 4 a day (or more depending on who is staffing the area). There were many iguanas while we were there and they were quite entertaining. One jumped from the top of a palm tree into the water and swam through the pool to promptly get out. They didn't bother anyone and aren't dinosaur size as some say, but they do like food and might come towards you if you have some. The kids and adults in our party loved the slide, and people said the ocean was great. It rained every day that we were there, but sometimes the showers lasted 10 minutes and then the sun would come back out. A great pool and the grounds look spectacular. Parking - we had to deal with parking a lot as we actually stayed at a villa on the Rio Mar resort property several nights. We drove our golf cart over (dodging the numerous pot holes) and parked by the playscape, which was much easier, but we also used a few spots in front of the hotel or parked in the garage. Both times we validated our ticket and went to get the car, the gate was up so that we didn't even need to pay to get out. Check that first! By the last few days of our stay, it had rained so much that the garage was flooded with over a foot of water and they weren't charging people to leave or park in the overflow. Parking is hard to come by on the weekends. It is not far off and you don't have to walk far - just pay first and then take the elevator to the lowest level and walk to your car. Not difficult at all. Rooms - my mother-in-law said her first room smelled terrible so she was moved and eventually found a room that satisfied her. The ac thermostat on the wall might make you think you have control over the room temperature, but you really don't at all. My dad had issues with their room being too cold, and pointed out their thermostat wasn't working with the change of temperature, and the man at the hotel showed him it didn't matter what it is set on....so either it is on or off! We were to receive an upgrade to a 'junior suite' for our wedding package, and we actually received a major upgrade to the 'ocean suite' which was amazing. Came with fridge, coffee maker, separate bedroom, larger bath with sink/mirror on outside, amazing view and balcony...it was great. BTW, the floor numbers may be a bit deceiving. The lobby is actually on the 3rd floor, then there are floors 4,5,6, and 7 with rooms above. I think there are also rooms on 1,2, and 3, so definitely try to get higher. My MIL somehow got free internet by filling out some form but it took her awhile to get that to work. There are about 5 computers near the lobby with internet but they are always full. I can't really comment on the restaurants too much; several friends ate at Palio, the nice Italian restaurant, and their feedback was that it was salty and slow but really not that overpriced for a nice place. I think they got great service and loved the dessert. Mirabella was ridiculously slow for lunch when we went on a rainy day and they were dead, but our food took at least 45 minutes if not longer for burgers, soup, and a tuna sandwich. It was good though. The cold breakfast at Mirabella is included for our wedding block, which was nice for those guests who booked through the block, and they could upgrade to the full omelet/waffle/hot breakfast bar for $10 more. I did that one day and they didn't have pancakes or french toast so I was disappointed, but they had waffles, omelets, pastries, bacon, sausage, eggs, cereal, fruit, toasts, etc. One of my friends made the mistake of ordering off the menu and by the time she added up her meal, juice, and coffee, she would have been better off paying for the buffet. I loved the wrap I got at the little bakery/deli just outside of the casino. Know that you will pay more at the hotel, but the food is good and satisfying. Just invest in a good cooler or get the fridge for $10 a day so you can have your own beverages and perhaps breakfast. Other restaurants nearby - The hotel definitely is having issues with Richie's. We almost had our welcome dinner there, but our entire party ended up going there the night before. I ate with a group of 12 and our bill averaged out to $59 per person....some people got nicer seafood dishes, and all drinks are about $10. My margarita was great, but $59 for a margarita, beer, veggie burger, and a shared appetizer is a bit ridiculous. You are paying for the view, which is pretty great. I did get really sick the next day, so I am curious if Richie's was the reason.....we took cabs since the resort no longer lets the Richie's van on their property, and it was $16 for 5 of us to get there. I absolutely LOVED Antojito's restaurant which is at the bottom of the hill on the resort road off of #3. It was delicious and our food came out quickly even for our party of 10. My friends said theirs took forever, so who knows. It was probably my best meal and was $12. I loved it and wish I had gone back to try lunch and breakfast. Worth a cab ride and you will save money compared to hotel prices and get an authentic experience. Burger joint - Tattoo Tavern is supposedly the best kiosko to get a burger. I didn't go there but a local gave us the recommendation. Things to do - this is definitely a great hotel for going to experience the adventure nearby with ziplining, kayaking, hiking the rain forest, etc. I would be bored if I was just there for the resort. GET A CAR!!!!!!!! It is sooooo worth it to be able to explore different beaches and restaurants, and we even went to Old San Juan for an afternoon of shopping and dinner with friends; took only an hour without traffic on the way back. The resort is 35 min from airport if there is not traffic. We did Pure Adventure kayaking to the Bioluminescent Bay, did ziplining in Carolina at EcoTours, which was awesome and came with a tasty Puerto Rican lunch, and my friends did the rainforest and swam in the waterfalls. A few of my cousins did snuba and ATVing and like those activities too. When it was raining (which was all day for two of our days) there is nothing to do at the hotel. There is an outlet mall about 20 minutes back towards San Juan. Nightlife - There isn't really one at the hotel. The lounge near the lobby has some Latin dancing on the weekends and was pretty packed a few nights, but the place is dead during the week. The occupancy of the hotel determines what places are open and for how long (gift store closes earlier but is still open until 9). BTW take some Immodium AD with you as three of us had really bad experiences.....not sure what it was a result of. GOLF - my husband played twice and said the courses were good. Lots of iguanas out there too. FYI, the rental fee for clubs was waived, so if you don't want to take them, you can chance the free rental! Perhaps that was due to course condition with being wet. Couldn't play after Sunday as the course was pretty much underwater for the last two days due to the torrential rains that came through the area. Carts have GPS. Not fantastic courses but green fees were an adequate reflection of what you get. I liked San Juan but I enjoyed being closer to the rainforest and hearing the co-qui every night. They are amazing and I miss being lulled to sleep with their songs! I couldn't imagine paying the high season rates for the Rio Mar, but it was a great stay for our wedding group in July.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "MrsWTT", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely do your research! A great 'get-away' destination.\u201d", "Author": "MrsWTT", "ReviewID": "UR71782009", "Content": "First off - thanks to many travelers and reviewers on here so offered tips and suggestions for making a stay at the Rio Mar enjoyable! Some people come here to complain, but no one offers suggestions on how to make it better.. so I'd like to add my review of this trip with some ideas on what to do as well! RENT A CAR!!! - seriously! But it's probably safer and easier to rent from a company located at the airport. We went through Target/Economy rental cars (because of the cheap rate through Orbitz) and found ourselves in a sketchy side of town off the main Rt. 26 freeway. Finding the location to return it was horrendous, wished we went through a big name like Hertz or Avis located in the airport! Be warned - the drivers are HORRENDOUS! Some drive 100 mph on a local road, others will go 20 mph on the highway. Some dont' believe in the lane lines while others will iterally stop in the middle of a busy road, park, and get out to do business in the shops. Get a small car if you can, makes for easier parking and manuvering. The winding mountain roads are scary to manuever and be cautious when you get to those sharp curves, because you never know who is flying down the road! DIRECTIONS!! - if you do plan on driving yourself - make sure your directions are CLEAR and make sure you are choosing the correct route. We went through Garmin GPS for the first leg and got lost. Called the hotel and they told us to put in \"Calle Yunque\" and it literally brought us to a neighborhood's dead-end. Finally found \"Rio Mar\" in the lodgings section of the Garmin localsearch and made it there after an hour of being lost. If you want to take the \"scenic/local\" route like we did, then do this: from airport - take 26 to 187. 187 has lots of local beaches and kioscos to stop at to try the local flavor. Then right on 188 and left on Rt. 3. Follow Rt. 3 for about 10 miles and then you'll see the Rio Mar entrance on the left. PARKING!! - We arrived on a Sunday and had to drive around the the ONLY self-parking lot for about 15 mins before we finally found a nice gentleman who told us he was leaving and we could have his spot. The problem is that lots of locals take day trips to Rio Mar for the beach/pool/casinos and they fill up the self-parking lot. So either come really early or wait till late. The next day, due to the massive amount of rain, we were wading through that basement garage in water up to our ankles! Because it was a Monday, the place emptied out and finding parking was easier. Yes, it is $15 a day to self park. FOOD/DRINKS!! - The resort prices are horrendous! So expensive!! Plus, the only place I was interested in eating at was Shimas, and they were closed! If you plan on renting a car, make sure you stop at the Amigo on Rt. 3 (Amigo is their version of Walmart) and pick up necessities for snacking and drinking. A small bag of chips in the gift shop was $1.50. Bottled water was $3. Definitely treat yourself to one nice dinner on site, but don't be surprised if the food is \"so-so\". Vacation drinks (pina coladas, rum runners, mojiotos) were $10 for a small glass, beer was $7. We picked up a bunch of empanadas and plaintains in the Luquillo kioscos and had a great dinner for under $10! Antojitos at the bottom of the hill before Rt 3 was alright. We went at 11:30am expecting a lunch menu, but they were still serving breakfast. It took 45 mins to get my cold french toast and my husband's meal took another hour. There was a screaming toddler behind us, which made the experience bad, not to mention it started to pour down rain and we got soaked in our outdoor seating area! We didn't eat out again until the Luquillo Kioscos then a nicer meal in Old San Juan the following day. BEACH/POOLS!! - I wish I could say something about this, but it there was thunderstorms and lots of rain during our entire trip there. We never got to enjoy it. ROOMS!! - Request a 7th floor Ocean-Side room. We had mountain side. It was great to listen to the coqui frogs and \"rainforest\" sounds at night! Our room was literally above the valet entrance, so in the mornings, it was very loud with horns honking trucks moving in and out. Our room was clean, no complaints. Yes, I wish they had more towels. The tub/shower drain didn't close, and the water was slow to drain. I loved their \"True Blue Spa\" toiletries from Bath and Body Works, smells good! We had no issues with ice machines. I tipped the maid $2 the next day returned to extra towels, and more toiletries. They charge for internet. TV had basic cable. Balcony was nice for stepping outside, but no cover from the rain. CASINOS!! - Awful. There was one $5 Black Jack table, one $10 Roulette table, and one $15 3-card Poker table that was always empty. The place is crawling with local slot machine addicts who take up 3-4 machines at a time. There was BINGO night, and everyone was using the slot machines as their personal chairs/tables/bingo center. I love my slots, but it wasn't worth fighting with grandma. DAYTRIPS!! - El Yunque was closed when we tried to visit on Monday due to the torrential downpours, mudslides, downed trees, and possible flooding. Luquillo was okay, nice local flavor, but very dirty and smelly. Old San Juan was my favorite! If we go back, we're staying around there! Concierge had great driving directions to the main destinations! General resort comments: Lots of families and unsupervised kids. If you're looking for someplace romantic, you won't find it in the lobby or the main areas. The internet banks are constantly swamped with teenagers giggling over porn. The line to check-in was long with only 1 person working (at 3pm which was PRIME check-in time!). I watched one unsupervised toddler yank out a handful of flowers from the large vases and decor in the lobby and he proceeded to throw dirt all over the place. If it's raining, then you're pretty much screwed. Alot of the tours got postponed or cancelled altogether because of weather conditions. There was always a line at the front desk and phones were always busy. The bed was AMAZING! I got the best sleep there! I wish the weather cooperated with us. I guess I'm a little upset about this trip because we got no sun and no chance to really relax on the beach. But if you're looking for a place where you're okay with spending lots of money on sub-par service, then go to Rio Mar.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fayetteville, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cboring!\u201d", "Author": "PR712", "ReviewID": "UR71700423", "Content": "This hotel was boring!

When I checked in with the corporate group, the hotel staff was very pleasant. When my guest and I were on our own, at restaurants, walking the halls, or requesting room cleaning, the staff was quite rude. Prices were obscenely inflated on the resort property, and as other reviewers stated - it's very difficult to get anywhere without a rental car. The biggest problem was cleanliness - on the beach, in the adult pools and especially in the room. The bathroom had visible mildew, and smelled of it. The walls did not seem insulated at all. It sounded as if the people in adjacent rooms were in ours. The pipes in the walls were very noisy, and during the night, they would make knocking, whistling, and whining sounds that were very loud and disturbing. We may have been near to the pipes for the washing rooms or the kitchen, but regardless, these should be insulated. We did not get one good night's sleep. The floor was dirty, mostly in the bathroom, and this could be seen very clearly around doorways and in corners. When we checked into the room, there was a large dead insect behind the toilet. Four days later when we checked out, it was still there. I told the front desk about these problems, and they apologized, but the hotel was full at the time and they could not move us. I then wrote a letter of complaint when I returned home. The customer service representative, Tammy Forrest, responded to me. She thanked me for my feedback, and offered a \"goodwill\" gesture of giving me 1 night's stay in the form of a voucher - if I provided a receipt or credit card statement showing how much I paid! How rude! She knew darn well that this was a corporate stay, and the company paid for it - I said so. A customer service employee who is capable of giving out vouchers cannot make contact with someone in her own company to find out how much 1 night's stay cost? I responded and told her that I didn't have the info, and she would have to contact the hotel to find out. Two months later, she hadn't responded to me at all, and I still hadn't received a voucher. I emailed her again saying I haven't heard back, and I haven't received anything in the mail, so I'm assuming the matter has been dismissed? She replied that she would mail me a voucher for $100 and that I would receive it in 2-3 weeks. It's been 5 weeks and still no voucher. She managed to take a bad situation and make it worse. I guess terrible customer service runs rampant throughout the Wyndham brand.

Cannot stress enough that this can be a wonderful place to stay AS LONG AS YOU READ THE REVIEWS AND PLAN AHEAD!. First of all, you must rent a car unless you are independently wealthy and/or plan to never leave the resort.. We flew into San Juan and had reserved a moderately-priced car online with Hertz, no issues, hassle free arriving and departing. Took about an hour to get to the resort. The traffic once you get off the toll highway can be heavy. The resort and the grounds are beautiful! We booked through Cheap Caribbean and knew going in we booked a very basic package but we were pleased. We arrived around 2 pm, our room was ready and we were upgraded to a mountain view room on the 4th floor. I would say you would need to be on the 4th floor or above to get the benefits of the ocean or mountain view rooms, so be aware of that. We ate at the pool snack bar/restaurant-knew it would be over-priced and it was, but the food was good and we were starving! We had already booked a bioluminscent bay tour in Fajardo for that evening, we stopped at the little restaurant at the bottom of the hill for a cheap dinner-nothing special but inexpensive compared to the resort. Had a bit of trouble locating a parking spot and finding our kayaking company in Farjardo but we did cut it close on time. Loved the tour, a once in a lifetime experience but be warned that it is kayaking in the dark, not for small children. With all the exercise we slept very soundly! We did hear some hall noise and some noise in the room next to ours but it was not excessive. Our room had a walk in shower and the water did leak out onto the floor, we called for extra towels and made a barrier, that took care of the problem for us, we discussed asking for another room but we LOVED the mountain view so much-literally we sat out on the balcony every chance we had-we decided to stay. The next day we drove back into San Juan to tour the Spanish Fort. On the way out we picked up breakfast at the bakery at the foot of the hill. Yummy and inexpensive! The San Juan trip is the only thing I would not do again, the drive was long and it rained on the way making the trip more than an hour. It was very hard to find a parking place in San Juan. However the fort was interesting once we got there and we had some great cheap food for lunch in a small cafe. We spent the afternoon at the beach/pool. We had drinks in a cooler, although the resort did have a good happy hour special each day we were there on rum punch, pina coladas and the local beer. Other than the happy hour special the drinks were very expensive. We went to the Amigo grocery store for our supplies, very quick in and out, others have suggested Wal-Mart but I couldn't face Wal-Mart on my vacation! That night we went to the kiosks for dinner, which I recommend for the atmosphere and the food. We went to a burger place to save money and it was very good, but we talked to people at the resort who went to very nice places and had wonderful seafood. The kiosks vary widely on food, price, and quality so ask around before you go. The next day we had booked an Eastwinds snorkling excursion. We had coffee from the snack bar by the casino and some fruit and breakfast bars we got from the Amigo for breakfast, lunch was provided on our snorkeling tour. Book everything yourself, you save a ton of money and it is very easy. We used our phones that had internet, but the concierge will give you a sheet with phone numbers of all the tour companies. We had never snorkeled and loved it! Initially we were disappointed that the sailing boat was full so we were on the motorboat, but that turned out to be to our advantage because we moved faster and got in more snorkeling time and got back earlier to enjoy more beach time at the resort. We liked the beach, it was clean when we were there. It was not crowded but certainly full. If you wanted more privacy all you had to do was walk to the left or right and set up your chair in a secluded spot, there was even shade available if you were willing to walk and find it. That night for dinner we ate at a horse ranch right down the street someone on the beach recommended. It was really good, and a neat experience, but not inexpensive. The third full day we went to the rain forest national park which is only about a mile or two from the hotel. We hiked and had a great time! Beautiful and very cool in the higher elevations. Very steep hike but worth it. Got sandwiches from the little bakery for lunch and ate them on our balcony, spent the rest of the day at the beach/pool. That night we treated ourselves to dinner at Palio. It was an awesome meal! The only misstep was the bottle of red wine we ordered came to the table quite warm, I thought that was odd given the otherwise superior food and service (and prices)! Probably should have said something but we didn't, just put ice cubes in our glasses! The only unpleasant experience we had was that twice in the late afternoon while reading a book I was accosted by an employee who insisted he had to \"take my chair\" because they were clearing the beach. They were clearing the beach, but I noticed the first time it happened that he was approaching women alone and standing there leering as the women stood up, put their things away, etc. When it happened to me the second time (same man!) I went to the front desk and complained. The female manager was very nice, she called the manager of the beach/pool area and I explained what had happened. They told me local laws required that beach be cleaned by a certain time, I told them I had no problem with that but clearly this man was not behaving in an appropriate manner. I really don't know if they took me seriously but they listened respectfully and offered us a free buffet breakfast a Mirabelle's the next day. We did appreciate that since we were planning just to pick up a cheap fast-food breakfast the next day on our way to the airport. It was a good breakfast, but I wouldn't pay the full price ($22) for it. I think this resort is very nice. It is true that the food and drinks and parking are expensive, but they have to make money to keep up the grounds and keep up the quality of the food. The few meals we did eat on the resort were certainly delicious. I don't think the reviews emphasize enough how beautiful the grounds, the pools, and the hotel are and that you are in a prime location with a view of the ocean and the mountains! If the prices are going to bother you either book an all-inclusive somewhere else or plan to eat most of your meals off-site. The whole time we were there we saw tons of families having a great time just like we were. We talked with lots of folks on the beach and at the pool and except for the griping about the prices of the food and alcohol people seemed pretty satisfied. We heard lots of positive things about the kids club but ours were too old for that. One day our room was not made up in the morning and I called and it was cleaned promptly after that. So many people in the reviews complained about the cleanliness but if they are willing to come and clean promptly when you are dissatisfied seems like it shouldn't be a deal-breaker. The employees do expect tips, Puerto Rico has a very high poverty rate and these are low-wage employees. The iguanas did not bother us, when we were there we saw them every day but not so many that they were annoying.

Our first couple days were at the Gran Melia (sol melia vacation club) and our next stay was at Rio Mar for just one night. We arrived later in afternoon around 4 and it was drizzling so I really don't have much to say about to pool but did notice they had the adult pool right next to the main pool and it looked well kept with lots of chairs and just steps from the beach. As far as the beach, it is very similar to the beach in Punta Cana Dominican Republic. I've uploaded a picture so feel free to check it out. I LOVED not seeing any other hotel on the beach ....just a big beach with lots of trees. The beach is so much better than the beach at Gran Melia. We stayed in a basic room and it was nice, air conditioning was awesome, and it was spacious but nothing fancy which i don't care much for since we only slept and showered in. As far as the hotel, I was SO surprised how beautiful it was. Gran Melia was beautiful also but this had an elegance that the Gran Melia didn't have. We are big fans of both resorts. We did like the eating spot right out the gate down the hill on the left. Again, we only stayed one night but it was a tour and I checked out the entire facility and took lots of pictures. The service was REALLY good and it was not as crazy as the Gran Melia. We spent an hr. in El Conquistador to check out the resort and it was nothing comparable to Gran Melia or E.C.

Let's start with when we arrived, I booked thru Cheap Caribbean, and it was a good deal so I thought. We arrived at the hotel and they didn't have my reservation, and of course using my blackberry with the booking ID on it, I thought they would be able to look it up. Fat chance, they made me sign up for a timeshare presentation just to get it printed on there computer so that I could check into a room I already paid for. Anyway, they still couldn't find it, but gave us a room anyway. The room was about as nice as a Hampton Inn for the interior, nothing special. Let's move on to the timeshare scam. All of the front desk and concierge will tell you about this \"great continental breakfast\" for couples, but what they don't tell you is that its not a continental, its a few muffins still in plastic wrap, and you have to sit there for two hours while they intensely pressure you into buying a timeshare points program from the Wyndham Vacation. Ours was over two hours and I just wanted to leave. The guy came back and told me that I had to put down $7k just in closing costs, which as I know is high even for a home equity, much less a $20k timeshare. Either way, stay away from that. So onto the hotel and beach resort, lobby is nice and open, the staff is very friendly. There is a tiny casino with much different rules on blackjack than I have heard of, so I stayed away. The hotel food, stay away from Shima, unless you want to pay for over priced Pad Thai, like $20 a plate of the worst Pad Thai you have ever eaten. Who goes to Puerto Rico and has Asian food? The one restaurant I would recommend if you don't have a car and can get off the resort is Marbello, its actually really good, but again, its pricey. Also don't get conned into going to Richy's, very very overpriced. I would recommend even taking a cab and going to the kiosks in Luquillo which is like 3 miles away and great local food for about $30, you can get a nice meal for two with apps and drinks, very cheap. If you go into Luquillo square area, there are a few places there and everyone speaks English, plus its even cheaper, maybe $15 for two meals. For breakfast, there is a little bakery at the bottom of the hill on the corner of Rt 3 and 968 called Isamar Bakery, great breakfast for a total of $10 for two. Marbello will charge you $22 a head for a good buffett of breakfast, however, not worth it. Proximity to anything. Not really, except for El Yunque Rainforest which is pretty much right across the street. If you are going to Culebra for a day sale or the ferry, you are about half hour and that is fine. It's not a bad drive at all. From San Juan, its about 45 minutes and not bad either. However, if you are looking to really explore past those two areas, you're going to need a rental car and drive quite a bit. I highly recommend driving a couple hours over to Jobos beach, its amazing and much better beach than you will get at the Wyndham or around San Juan. Beaches, which is why your down there, don't stay at the Wyndham, not a good beach and it's the Atlantic, if you are content with the pool, do that a few days and definitely take a day sale over to Culebra with East Island Excursions, they are great and good priced, but you can book separately and it will save you $50 a person. Let me go to value, there are hidden charges that others have eluded to including parking, make sure you park your own car, this will save you $10 a day, since its $15 a day if you are a hotel guest, $25 for valet, just take a left at the fork when its says parking. Also if you don't book thru a travel package, there is a 15% room cleaning fee that they tack on. I heard a few people yelling about it. Oh and before I forget, the drinks at the bars are $10 a pop, my recommendation and this is what we did after buying 4, was going to the supermarket, IE Ralph's and buying our own there, it was literally the cheapest Rum and Cokes I have ever bought, since Rum is made there, its very very cheap. Don Q was the best for mixing. Internet is non existent here unless you have brought your own jack to hook up to the ethernet, sorry no IPods or IPads here, no wireless. The golf courses are nice, big plus for me, as I am an avid golfer, they have a Tom Fazio course and a Greg Norman course, both are fun, probably in the area of 128 slopes, so fun, but not overly challenging. Don't even bother with the gym, just run on the beach or swim, the gym is terrible for a YMCA gym in Compton. Hopefully this helps. If you don't want to do anything but relax and quiet, this is probably a good place, however, if you like to explore, I would suggest the Conquistador in Fajardo, or Condado area which has a decent beach and is close to everything in San Juan.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRio Del Mar resort not worth it!\u201d", "Author": "Busterandapple", "ReviewID": "UR70168845", "Content": "We will never return.

Also they have alot of activities for kids. Ex: Bingo, feeding iguanas, waterslides, and fun movie nights at the pool. Around Christmas time the resort is decorated to the T. the buffet all of the way on the quiet side is the best! Also by the pool if you want lunch you can order it and just watch your kids swim, or you can stop by the little lunch place for some tuna, burgers, salads .. the good stuff!

We were there 6/26/10 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7/3/10. If you are heading to the Rio Mar and reading this, you are definitely on the right track. I did a lot of research online, reading reviews and searching as much stuff as I could think of before heading down, which helped tons. So much in fact, we felt compelled to share our experience in hopes of helping others. You must rent a car and get a fridge for your room! Much cheaper than cabs and getting transportation to any excursions you may do. The fridge is pretty big and you can fit a lot of stuff. Our flight arrived at 11:30 p.m., if you can get in earlier I highly recommend it as it is very dark, roads are not marked very well and the scenery is incredible. The room we thought we had booked and confirmed, ocean view, high floor, king bed was not held for us! Supposedly the rooms are on a first come, first serve basis if you are travelling through Wyndham. Not sure how it works if you are through the hotel but they are 2 separate entities. We were put on the 2nd floor that night and promised they would move us up higher the next day. We were very happy to be moved up to the 7th floor with an incredible ocean view. If you want a good view of the ocean, you must be on the 6th or 7th floor as the palm trees are so tall. Self parking is very easy to do and not a long walk at all. Will save you $5 per day plus tipping the valets. The casino in the resort was fun and we about broke even for the 3 or 4 nights we went. The little caf\u00c3\u00a9 next to the casino was great, decent prices for a resort and very good sandwiches and wraps. Great ham, egg and cheese croissants for breakfast and pretty good pizza. The gift shops by the elevator to self parking and the one by the pool had some really nice things and surprisingly, very reasonable prices. There is a Walgreens and local Amigo grocery store a few miles east on Rt. 3. We bought all of our beer, water, and snacks there. We also bought a small collapsible cooler and packed it full of beer every night we stayed at the resort and took it everywhere. Yes, you can drink your own beer in the casino! Beers at the resort bars are $7 - $8 each. We only charged the fridge and parking to the room. Be sure to check your room charges, we got charged valet parking every day when we did self parking. Was an easy fix though through the front desk. Sign up for Wyndham By Request and bring your assigned number, gets you free internet for your room. One last thing about Rio Mar, we never found a working ice machine. Literally thought we were on hidden cameras and a joke was being played on us. We ended up going to the bar and they were more than happy to fill our cooler for us. It is customary to tip everyone, starting with the bus driver to your rental car! We experienced some of the best food ever in Puerto Rico, extremely fresh and full of flavors. We did not eat in any of the main restaurants at the resort, just the caf\u00c3\u00a9 as I mentioned. Richie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a 2 minute drive up the mountain from the self parking garage, turn right out of the resort. Incredible, open air restaurant with very friendly staff and what a view! The food was super and prices were reasonable. Antojitos is at the bottom of the mountain from the resort just before you get to Rt. 3. Also awesome food and crazy cheap. We had a fantastic local lunch with 2 sodas and a $5 tip for $18! The Kioskos are the place to go. We felt everything looked pretty dirty off the resort and the Kioskos are no different. There are over 60 of these Kioskos on the left side of Rt. 3 and very easy to get to. #2, La Parilla and #12, El Jefe Burger Shack are the best. Tim and Sheri own El Jefe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and one of them is always there. Good people and super food at both, also very clean. Excursions, we went on a 2 hour ATV tour through El Yunque. Hacienda Carabali was the company and they were a 10 minute drive from the resort. They also do horseback tours for a more tame experience. We had an absolute blast on our own ATV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cruising through rivers, puddles, holes, jungle and incredible views. You stop to swim in a crystal clear river with a huge rock you can jump off. Alfredo was our guide and he was great. We also only had 5 total ATV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in our group which was nice. We took East Wind excursions for a snorkel trip, wanted to go to Culebra but the seas were too choppy. Instead went to 3 other stops to swim and snorkel and it was paradise. Every picture we took look like screen savers! The motorized Catamaran was the way to go as you get to places much faster. Lastly, the Caribbean Trading company was a very unique gift shop. Just go straight across Rt. 3 from the resort and follow that road to the right, it is on your left hand side. Very cool, local artisan things as well as your regular touristy gifts. The concierge at the resort can give you lots of good things to do but book the trip yourself, much cheaper. I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it, enjoy Puerto Rico and the Rio Mar!!", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philly", "Title": "\u201cOur party of 15 arrived at this resort on...\u201d", "Author": "DaniKi", "ReviewID": "UR69544948", "Content": "Our party of 15 arrived at this resort on July 1 for a bachlorette party.

Getting off the resort to go to clubs, restaurants, and even the grocery store was a NIGHTMARE. The taxi prices were ridiculous. A trip to the grocery store five minutes away cost 4 people $20 round trip. A trip to Old San Juan to visit Brava night club at the Waldorf Astoria was $308 round trip! Prices were extremely high and options were limited. The resort has one restaurant that offers breakfast. Needless to say, the wait time to actually eat breakfast was often so long that it carried over to lunch time. The lobby bar served fingerfood and the pool side bar served lunch.

Our visit was fabulous! The staff was very attentive, especially Daisy, Marilyn and Maria at concierge. We really planned for our trip and took the advice of the TripAdvisor members. That is the key. You may want to consider renting a car for at least part of the trip. We rented a car for three days. Javier with Enterprise was very helpful. He recommended that we reserve a car online for a lower price. You can find him in the lobby of the hotel. There is a fee for parking. The fee is $15 for self-parking and $20 for valet. You receive one night complimentary parking with a rental from Enterprise. Our room was cleaned each day to our satisfaction. If you have a car, you can do the El Yunque hike on your own. There is really no reason to book through the hotel. El Yunque is amazing. You may want to research other options for tours. If you use a taxi, please be sure that your expectations are understood. We used a taxi for the Bacardi/Old San Juan tour. We were overcharged for the service that we received. We decided to do the tour again but through the hotel. If you aren't interested in the Bacardi tour, you should opt for the Old San Juan shopping tour. You can purchase rum at the airport for about the same price as you would pay at the factory. Old San Juan is absolutely beautiful! We also drove to Fajardo one mroning. We were looking for the lighthouse but we weren't able to find it. We only ate a few meals at the resort. ERL is a good choice for a quick breakfast to go. It is located outside the casino. Upon our arrival we had lunch at the Tiki bar. The food was very good. We had dinner at Palio (Italian). It was excellent. The atmosphere was nice and the service was very good. You are able to purchase half portions. On the last morning, we had the breakfast buffet at Marbellas. It was another wonderful experience. The prices were what you expect to pay at a resort. On the first night we ate at Riches. We took a cab, but later saw a sign for free transportation. The food was average but the view was magnificent. We ate at the kiosks at Luquillo twice. We had dinner at La Parrilla. It was very good. We had lunch at Congas. It was very good as well. In Old San Juan we had lunch at Barrachina. The first pina colada was made there. The food was excellent, especially the black bean soup. On our second trip,we ate at The Parrot Club. The food was good and the portions were very large. My favorite meal was at the Hacienda Carabali. The churraso was so delicious. Two mornings we ate at Isamar Bakery as suggested by the reviews. The food is good and reasonably priced. One morning we ate at Antojitos. The food there is good and reasonably priced also. Both are near the resort. We also went to Amigo grocery store (associated with Walmart) to buy water, drinks, etc. Near there is a small restaurant ( mainly carryout) called La Verde. The food is excellent. Since my friend and I are both Spanish teachers, we were mainly interested in the culture and sightseeing. We did visit the beach and pool area some. The Internet lounge is always busy. At times the computers don't work properly. If you need something printed, the concierge staff would be willing to help you.

Are you coming to enjoy nightlife and whoop it up? If so, this isn't the spot - go stay in San Juan. Are you coming to enjoy a beach, enjoy a true destination resort? Then this may just be the place! This hotel is very well laid out - it's a big hotel but doesn't feel that way. Rooms are nice and big, clean, hallways a bit dark and need some updating. Lots of choices onsite for restaurants and bars. Expensive - yes. But, as was recommended earlier, you can and should rent a car at least for part of the time you're here and drive a little way to Luquillo to go to the Kiosks (La Parilla is AMAZING). DON'T get a cab...it's too expensive and a few trips you would have paid for the car! Food at the restaurants is mostly very good. In Marbella, Caprese salad with guava paste (I know...it sounds gross, doesn't it?) was incredible along with the Gazpacho Shooters. Pizza at the little restaurant by the casino? Frozen pizza-esque, but I wasn't expecting much anyway. This little spot makes a mean cup of coffee however (even if it is $4...ah, well, so is Starbucks!). Service is very good, friendly and helpful. Dragonfly is ok...the drivers to/from airport are great, but their desk staff is marginal. Tours are interesting (sometimes expensive) but as mentioned before the minimum 4 people deal can mean you may have to change your plans. Pools are great whether you're here as an adult or with kids. Nice beach - sand is not a white sand beach and I'm sure there are better beaches in PR, but it is right outside your door (other hotels on this side don't have it) and my 6 year old had a ball for hours upon hours. If you stay here, be sure to either drive yourself to Old San Juan or take a tour of it. It is an amazing place not to be missed. Also, be sure to go to Richies around sunset (it's further up the road when you turn off to go to the Rio Mar resort).

I often read reviews, but never leave them myself; however because other reviews helped me so much for this trip I felt compelled. Shame on anyone for writing a poor review of this place if you did not read other reviews ahead of time. If you are smart and plan ahead you can have a great time without breaking the bank. 1st, the resort. Absolutely beautiful. Very clean, wonderfully decorated, and the staff was as good as I've dealt with. That said, it is a huge resort, somewhat isolated from things. ***TIP 1*** Rent a Car! We used hotwire and got an $11 per day rate. Even if you factor in the $20 per day valet, we saved a boat load of money eating all breakfasts and lunches off site as well as booking all excursions by ourselves. Also, we packed our GPS. 2nd, food. Breakfast - either Antonijo's or Isamar's at the bottom of the hill have great breakfasts for under $5 per person. Did not eat breakfast on the resort but knew the price to be $22 per person. Lunch - $5.50 speacial at Antonijo's was wonderful. All other days we ate at one of the Luquillo kiosks. They were easy to get to, had amazing food at great prices, the people were great; what more can you ask for? Dinner - we also ate at the kiosks some nights. At Palio we both had a lobster/scallop/shrimp pasta special, which was amazing. With a bottle of wine the bill was about $100, exactly what we pay at home in Boston. At Shima's we both had a lamb chop special, also very good. The bill was also about $100, but the service was horrible. 3rd, the pool - We did not go to the \"Activity\"/Kid pool, only the adult pool. The fact that there were no kids there made my trip. I like kids, but not on my honeymoon. The pool was great, a bunch of chairs, and even though we didn't pay for one, there were plenty of cabanas to duck under for the occasion 10 minute rain storm. Drinks here, as well as everywhere, were expensive (about $10 each). ***TIP 2*** Have a cooler. Some bought syrofoam coolers, we brought two collapsable bag coolers which were very handy. Buy beer from a gas station, Walmart, or the store at the bottom of the hill and filler the coolers with ice. ***TIP 3*** If you want \"island drinks\" buy a blender and make them yourself. We got a blender for $20, and all the ingredients we needed for pina coladas and saved a ton. We were hoping to pass it on to someone before leaving but couldn't find anyone interested. 4th, excursions - Again, you're insane if you book through Dragonfly at the resort. We did the zipline trip, an absolute blast. Go to yunkezipline.wordpress.com for contact information. It was about $30 per person cheaper to book yourself and drive to their meeting point. ATV ride, also an amazing time. The name of the ranch is Hacienda Carabali and you can find all information on their website. Again, about $30 per person cheaper if you book and transport yourself. Both of these places are literally right across the street. We did a full-day snorkel trip to Iacos through East Wind. This included a 2-hour beach/lunch stop and a 2-hour snorkel stop on the reef. It was also an open bar all day. I highly reccomend; they were great. Also through East Wind we did the bio bay tour to Vieques, where you swim in the water instead of canoe. It was extremely cool, but I wouldn't reccomend doing the same say as the snorkel trip like we did. We were extremely tired and didn't appreciate it as much. Other things - the casino was ok, neither of us are huge gamblers. It did seem to have a huge amount of slot machines though. The spa seemed ok, neither of us used any of their services. The gym was weak by my standards, not nearly enough free weights. They did have a good amount of treadmills, but I ran on the beach in the mornings instead. The golf courses looked amazing, but I did not play due to it being my honeymoon. I forsee future trips in which I will play. People complain about the internet. In my opinion, if you don't need it enough to already have it on your cell phone, then you can probably survive the trip without it. Overall, as I have said before, if you plan ahead and are smart about things, you can certainly enjoy yourself thoroughly without focusing too much on the money you spend. The resort was an absolute paradise and I would certainly reccomend to other honeymooners, couples, as well as families as there is a ton of things they do for kids as well. If you are looking for an insane nightlife, I'd stay in San Juan.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNot up to par\u201d", "Author": "olafdamm", "ReviewID": "UR68126416", "Content": "We had a room with view of the beach and a balcony.

Our balcony chairs should have been replaced years ago. The rest of the building needs updating. The food in the restaurants is expensive and not the quality you would expect for the price. The beach is nice and fairly clean, the staff is kinda rude about removing their umbrellas and beach chairs at 5:00 pm when the beach closes for the sea turtles. The don't kick you off the beach they just remove their property from the beach. We watched them take away a couples chairs even though there were other unoccupied chairs they could have collected first. This happened on more then one occasion. The Iguana Lizards around the pool aren't too bad, although you need to be careful of their droppings which they leave around the pool deck. On one occasion an Iguana dropped a mess from a tree nearly hitting a lady lounging. The sad part was the staff did not clean it up for a couple of hours. Overall the resort is expensive for the service you receive (they charge $15 a day for internet, $10 for a refrigerator and $15 a day for parking). If you do stay there I would highly suggest to leave the resort to eat much better food at locations outside the resort. Don Pepe is one example close by and reasonably priced food.

The manager, Anna, was wonderful. Expect resort prices, it is a resort after all. Not every restaurant was open every night. Find out which one is open on the night you plan to go ahead of time. There is also a piano player that plays nightly on the lower level, very romantic. The pool was never crowded, practically deserted after 6pm. The hot tub did not get very hot though. We took advantage of the 2 for 1 drink specials at the beach tiki bar, Henry, the bartender was hilarious! We didn't spend much time on the beach, too busy, but it was very pretty. The iguanas are everywhere but they keep to themselves unless you try to feed them. My best advice is, rent a car. We did a lot of exploring. We drove to the rainforest, Old San Juan and to Bio Bay for a bioluminescent kayak tour. All I highly recommend. You can do all of this without the help of the resort. The concierge staff is very helpful and can get you a map to anywhere you want to go.

It has 3 pools. One adult pool, one activities pool with a water slide and a small kiddie pool. It also has a jacuzzi. The beach is ok, but I've seen better beaches in the Caribbean (especially in Dominican Republic). The pool and beach areas have enough chairs and allow for a quiet ambience. There were some kids running around, but they have their pool area. It was just relaxing music and the sound of the shore. Our room was clean, the beds cozy and we had a beautiful mountain view facing El Yunque Rainforest. Beware, the walls of the room are thin. You can hear the water running and flushes in the room next door. I was awoken at 6am by the shower running next door. The restaurants are nice and the food ok, and the ambience is quite elegant. We paid over $100.00 for a simple italian dinner. Parking is $20.00 per night for valet and $15.00 for self parking. Self parking is \"over the hill and through the woods\". We opted for valet. Please be advised the resort is away from everything and about 35 minutes by car from the city of San Juan. You WILL NEED a car to get around, or you will be confined to the resort. We had breakfast down the hill from the resort (make a left at the exit of the resort) at a very beautiful and inexpensive typical Puertorican restuarant called Antojitos Puertorriquenos. We had dinner in a number of places. Many suggested Ritchies (up the hill from the resort), but it's a bit pricey and the food was not that good, but the view is outstanding! We did go to a wonderful restaurant in Old San Juan called The Latin Roots. They have live bands playing each night, and the food is good. Parking is available in the same facility as the restaurant.

We stayed at the Rio Mar Resort and loved every minute. The place is just beautiful, and every single member of the hotel staff that we encountered was friendly and professional. Our room was lovely; the woman at the check-in desk upgraded us from a resort view room to a partial ocean view without us even asking for it. The view actually was pretty good. I like to stay at higher-end hotels, but didn't have any expectations for this one because I got such a deal, and booked not too far in advance. I was totally surprised at how nice everything was. Very clean, great pools and beach, and awsome food. That was a complete shock. I generally don't think much of hotel food, and my husband and I are total foodies. The three resaurants at Rio Mar were way above average. I didn't think the prices were too unreasonable for a resort, and certainly were less than I pay when I go out in NYC. Very high quality food, and generally good (but typically laid back time-wise) service. I will say that the drinks were very pricey everywhere on the property. But there is access to alcohol at the grocery and package stores if you want to spend less and have a car. We didn't have a fridge in the room, so we didn't do that. Not sure if any of the other rooms have them. There isn't a club for dancing in the hotel, although on Saturday night there was a live salsa band in the lobby. Tons of people were there and the dancing was amazing. Most of the dancers were from a wedding reception and from other groups staying for the weekend. Very fun! The weather was pretty good overall. Didn't interfere with our activities much. Its very hot and humid so be prepared for bad hair days. Rained every day, but mostly for brief periods, and the sun still was out in typical Carribean fashion. A couple of days it did rain morein the p.m., so hit the pool/beach early to ensure tanning time. Went on an outing with Salty Dog catamaran excursions in Fajardo. Booked it ourselves. $65 for the day, including food and booze, and snorkeling equipment. Sasso (Cap'n) and the cute boys were a blast! Went to 2 reefs (2nd was way better). Crashed the El Conquistador after with some new friends. That resort is a must see! Pay for parking and say you are having lunch/dinner at one of the restaurants (look up names; don't remember). Ate at the kiosks twice. The Burger Shack was great, as was La Parilla (although I didn't like what I ordered; not them, just didn't like it). If you are skittish about low rent districts, with lots of grime and \"character\", don't go to the kiosks, though. Its very local, but interesting if you are up for a very casual dinner or lunch. Definitely drive there; apparently walking is not advised. We had no safety problems anywhere we went in PR; never felt a moment of nervousness. But common sense should be exercised (anywhere, for that matter). Didn't have time to do the rain forest, which was stupid on our part. Couldn't get into any excursions with zip lining. They all need min 4 people. But we are going to get it in next trip within the first day or so. Did Old San Juan on our last day. It was Africa hot and rain forest humid, so it wasn't as much fun as it might have been. Probably wouldn't go back, though. Once was enough. Beautiful old buildings and lots of museums, but shopping was just ok. Only had lunch, but there are lots of hip looking restaurants at the east end of town in the SoFo district. Overall, for a 6 day getaway, this was a great trip.

Mirabella had about average service and food but fit the bill for our first night there (it was late and we were exhausted from traveling). Yes the food is expensive here but no more so than the Hyatt in Dallas so I'm not sure why that's surprising or unusual. Parking - the fee stinks but we knew that going in. Other than that, no problems. Rooms - We had a nice mountain view room with a king bed. Everything appeared clean and the bedding was very nice and soft. I always had very hot water in the shower and maid service was prompt and efficient. My only beef is 2 out of 3 times I went to the ice machine I got nothing out. This MIGHT be because so many people had styrofoam coolers and the machines couldn't keep up. Service - Front desk attendants were prompt and friendly. The parking attendants were less friendly. Casino - Hubby did quite well at the poker tables here so he was enjoying himself. I didn't do so well at the black jack table...lol. Hotel building - beautiful Spanish style decor. We loved that they lowered the lights in the evening and had the hotel decorated with candles. There is also frequently music playing to add to the festive atmosphere. Beach - plenty of umbrellas and chairs. I never saw more than about 8 people on the beach so the quiet was wonderful. Note - the sand is darker and therefore the beach lacks that clear blue appeal that many other caribbean beaches have. This is not the hotel's fault however :) Just be aware. We probably won't return to PR, at least for a while, d/t the fact that we are big beach people and are in love with the island of St. John.

Also, do not book activities through the hotel, we ask for a price guide, just to compare and ended up booking all of our activities by googling places and saved at least half of the price for everything.

We had rented 3 bedroom condo on the beach, What a wonderful week we had, very relaxing, lots of time on the beach and in the beautiful pool (loved the Zero depth walk in for the little 2 yr old!) The villa was very accommodating for our needs, 3 bedrooms, 3 full baths, with full kitchen, front room, 2 decks to enjoy the ocean view. It came with towels, (bath and pool), all bed linen supplied, and we did get a crib also. Also included a starter supply of paper towels, bath soap, small amount of dishwashing detergent, kleenix, and toilet paper, Basically clean rooms, (we did not hire housekeeping, did our own wash (washer and drier in one of the bathrooms) the first day we did take a run to the supermarket to stock up on basics, Ralphs Food Warehouse is 10 min from Rio Mar, and has everything you need, The pools, grounds, beach were very clean and well kept up, Staff very helpful with any problems (had some trouble with the airconditioner, which was fixed the next day.) You definetely need a car, as the resort area is too large to walk to anything outside, and even tho many restaurants in resort, they are very expensive! Lots of very nice reasonable restaurants just a few miles outside the resort. Several we had heard of from forums here, were, Antojitos, (just down the hill where you turn into the resort road, very good and inexpensive (esp. breakfasts) Terraza montana, up the hill, great views, Isamars Bakery, good also, close to Antojitos. .We did eat several times at the pool bar at the resort, but with all of us (3 adults/3 kids) for lunch it was over $100.00 for basically hamburgers!! With 3 young kids we didn't do any tours, but did some driving around a little and stopped in a few small towns, enjoyed some great lunches in off the road places.(sorry can't remember names) We spent most of our time at the beach resort. We had no problems with any bugs, day or night, (the bitting kind) The weather was great, warm, but very windy, rainy a few hours each day but mostly sunny. The surf was strong, so didn't attempt to go too far out, but kids loved spending hours in the ocean getting 'knocked down by the waves\" and hunting for shells. The beach was wonderfully sandy, but shallow for a long way out so not good for snorkling . There is a small casino at the resort, and my daughter-in-law and i did go one evening and had a good time. There is a free shuttle bus that runs freq. between hotel and villas, which was great at night. Lots of Iquanas at the hotel pool, had daily \"feed the iquanas\" at 11:00am which the kids enjoyed, and also a nice slide in the family pool there, The hotel had a family pool and an adults only pool. We usually stayed at the villa pools as there was never more than a few people there. The walk to the hotel was only about 5-10 min from the villas, so no problem going back and forth for activities., and if you were at the villas you could enjoy any of the activities, pools, restaurants, etc at the hotel.

We had a little trouble finding the right place to check in, but eventually we got there. Our room was pleasant, no smell of mold or mildew, and the a/c worked great. I'm used to staying in timeshares, so I missed the separate kitchen and bedroom areas -- I couldn't get up early, make coffee, and take it out onto the balcony without waking my wife. We had lunch the first day in the Marbella restaurant. It was OK, not outstanding, and medium-pricy. We had arranged to rent a refrigerator, so we went into a nearby town and shopped at an Amigo for coffee (the in-room coffee was pathetic) and other necessities. Generally we made sandwiches and ate lunch in the room or by the pool. Yes, the restaurant and bar prices are high. We ordered mojitos from a waiter at the pool -- once. They were $10.50 each, so that was the end of that. We got an excellent rum (Ron del Barrilito) at the supermarket; the 3-star is about $20 for a 750 ml bottle. The pool area was pleasant, assuming you don't mind the occasional iguana. They really didn't bother anyone, aside from the occasional drama queen who would jump up on her chaise longue and screech whenever one got too close (defined as less than ten feet away). Yes, there is one iguana that occasionally dives into the pool from about 30 feet up in one of the palm trees. Who knew iguanas could swim that well? The parking situation is kind of strange; clearly designed to make you want to use valet parking for an extra $5/day. Once I figured out the system, though, it wasn't too bad: go down to the valet station, get my ticket validated, and then go to the garage and drive away. The only problem was that there is only one elevator that serves the garage area, and it is SLOW. Be warned, though, that when you check out you need to show your room bill to the parking valet so they can verify that you paid. After you leave the front desk, keep your receipt out, don't pack it. The golf course looked beautiful, but neither of us plays. We also didn't participate in any of the activities, since this was a veg-out week. The excursions offered through the hotel seemed outrageously expensive, though. We did our own excursion to El Yunque, which is almost literally right across the road from the resort. Go back down to PR 3 and continue across the highway, and in about a mile you're in El Yunque. It's very different from the beach, and quite interesting. But it can get really hot. Bottom line: It's a big tourist hotel for norteamericanos. The only locals we saw were on the weekend, and we figured the hotel sells day passes. Either that or locals from San Juan come for the weekend. So if you're looking to mix with the local population, it ain't gonna happen here. But it's clean and has beautiful grounds, and the staff are uniformly pleasant.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cWe prepared, so we weren't disappointed.\"\u201d", "Author": "hollyhol", "ReviewID": "UR63223908", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Rio Mar. We booked our vacation through US Airways vacations and paid a VERY reasonable price for a vacation package that included, R/T airfare, hotel, transportation to and from airport and a $100 food and beverage credit with the resort, taxes and fees. I will have to be honest and say that I was VERY apprehensive about staying at the resort after I read the reviews on trip advisor. But the trip was paid for, so what could we do. The reviews are very mixed, but all have some very valid points. I think you really have to pay attention to the comments from the reviewers whose travel situation mirrors yours. If I were traveling as a family with children, I would have found this place to be outrageously expensive. But I wasn't , so the prices did not send me into sticker shock. So for those traveling as a couple here is my review... Let's get the price shock out of the way first...Yes, the food and drink were somewhat pricey (roughly $22/pp for breakfast buffet, $10-12 for drinks, $20-$35 for dinner). But you are at a resort, on an island that is American \"owned\". Some of the prices at the resort reflect ones found in major US cities: Chicago, NY, LA, Miami, Las Vegas, etc. Yes, the car rental fee was a bit excessive ($59/day and a $200 deposit that is charged to your card, but refunded within 2 business days). Yes, if you rent a car the daily fee is $20-25 (but we're from Chicago, where the average price to park in a downtown lot on a daily basis can run from $15-26, so it didn't shock us). Yes, you have to pay $10 per day for a fridge (crazy!!). We arrived at the Rio Mar and had been told at check-in that we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite with an Ocean View. This was a very nice surprise. Not sure why they did it, nor did we question it. LOL! The room was very clean and our view was spectacular. No smell of mold or mildew as other reviews noted. It was a little chilly, so we turned down the air. Note: if you turn the air down to far or off, the floors become wet from the humidity so be careful. Also the beds were extremely comfortable (pillow top mattresses with down comforters). The hotel grounds were beautiful. The beach was clean. The adult pool is nice. If you are at the adult pool, everyday about noon, there is a huge iguana that is up in the trees, who jumps from the tree into the pool, climbs out and stops for pictures. Very interesting show. However on Sundays, there is not staff to bring food and drinks to the pools, so you will be on your own. No big deal though. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, especially a Ruben. He was GREAT!! He recommended some great places to eat and visit and each place was on point! Rio Mar Management, if you are read this review, you need to give him a raise. Also, all of the computers were in working order. I know that previous reviews indicated that there were only one or two that were working. We had planned to do different types of tours, however, when we got there, we decided to just rest and relax. But my advice is to book the tours outside of the hotel. Dragonfly Tours, located in the hotel, is very price. You would do better to go through sites like Viator.com, Yunke Tours (not sure of the address), etc. The food at the resort was very good. We ate a Marbella's and the Tiki Bar. We didn't get a chance to eat at the other restaurants, because we went off the resort to some local spots for dinner. Once place that has great food is Hacienda. They have a skirt steak, with rice and beans that is awesome! The atmosphere in the place is very relaxed. And as many of you know, it's NBA Playoff time. This place had TV's, good food and good drinks, so both me and my boyfriend were VERY happy. Another local spot we went to was called Guavas. It's located on Loquillo Beach. We went here to was the Mayweather/Mosely fight, have some good food and drinks. This place also turns into a nightclub, so if you are looking to hear good music and dance, this is a great spot. Finally, on a couple of evenings, we hung out at the Lobby Bar. Each night they had live music, where people could dance and have a good time. Also, the bar tenders were great. I have to say that my guy and I had a FANTASTIC time at this resort!! I would definitely stay here again. So, if you and your significant other/spouse would like to go somewhere that has beautiful grounds, quiet pool and beach where you can relax, and you don't mind spending just a little extra money here and there, I would recommend the Rio Mar.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful - but wierd nickel and dimed\u201d", "Author": "windskisong", "ReviewID": "UR63193713", "Content": "Absolutely stunning resort. Beach was beautiful (allowing for the constant junk coming out from the jungle - the staff cleaned it up the next day). Pools were clean and refreshing (other than one hot tub's controls were broken for the duration of our stay, but it was hot and refreshing). Facilities were clean. HOWEVER: AC - 1st room had thermostat, 2nd just had fan control. Staff explained functional change - we had moved to an older, less upgraded room that had a MUCH better location, and we were fine with that. Room location - we paid significantly extra for an oceanfront room. First room did face the ocean, but you couldn't see it because of the HUGE palm tree in front of the room, and it was set way back from the water. I asked about this, and the next day was moved to another room (less upgraded) that was still way back from the water, but you could in fact SEE the water and beach from the room. Internet - I saw on the web looking at the hotel and checked with the reservation 800#, and understood there was free internet, and there was internet in the room, and logically assumed there was free internet in the room. Internet in the room cost $15? per night. Free internet was 4 computers in the lobby that I never saw empty, and was told normally had waits of over an hour. Parking: The parking system was a disaster. We left the hotel 4 times including checkout. Process always took more than 20 minutes, sometimes as much as 40 minutes. Validated tickets worked less than 1/2 the time (I always did my best to beat the 15 minutes that I was allowed, and made it 3/4 of the time), there was frequently a line to get out. If you're going to charge $15/day for parking, use the room key, or staff the parking deck. Also, the $15/day charge just appeared on the bill, after making us jump through hoops to \"validate\" our parking tickets. If the parking staff had said \"ok, this time we have to charge you\", I would've paid the extra $5 and avoided the self parking the second day. The biggest negative of our visit. On the other hand, having an Enterprise car rental meant we got one day free. Won't let competing restaurants on the hotel to pick up guests. I understand why. We used the little sandwich shop by the casino, because it was the only semi-reasonable priced restaurant. Otherwise, portions are small, food is good, but VERY overpriced. Off-site, before you even get to the main road there are OUTSTANDING restaurants (Isamar Bakery) that are CHEAP. Final good note: Unlike in other places in Puerto Rico, we ALWAYS felt safe in and around this hotel. I obviously won't ding the hotel for this, but it did POUR for 80% of our time in Puerto Rico.

I have stayed at 4 and 5 star hotels and resorts and they do not nickel and dime their clients towards bankruptcy. They also empower their employees and ensure that service is there when you need it. Our room was good - as Wyndham rewards members we were upgraded to a junior suite, BUT no fridge or even a mini bar. ( this was the same in all the rooms- apparently they figure that guests might save some money by bringing in some of their own food and drink) For $10.00 a day, our friends rented a fridge from the hotel and got something that looked like it had been shot at with a shotgun and had little to no seals . Costs - Initial cost of stay was reasonable for what was expected BUT the extra added costs were almost highway robbery. 1st. - a 14% resort fee added to the room cost- this I was told was for services like towels pool etc and is not a tax put on by government but an extra charge levied by the \"resort\" and its competitors ( seems like price fixing to me). 2nd- The resort is isolated and about 50 minutes from SJU airport yet to further separated you from more of your cash, you have to pay $75.00pp return for a shuttle or rent a car. And if you rent a car you then have to pay $15 to $20 per day for parking. 3rd - The prices for food and Drink are outrageous at the resort - $4.00 for a cup of coffee, $22.00 for breakfast. Off resort coffee was 95 cents and breakfast $5.00 yet If you want to eat off resort you need a car or to walk 1 1/2 mile each way.

Well, our room was a delightful surprise-spacious (400 sq ft according to the brochure), full front panoramic ocean view (see our photo!), very clean, 2 extremely comfortable queen size beds with soft bedding and plenty of pillows, bright pleasant decor, great bathroom with wonderful toiletries, and AC that worked great. Nice balcony with a bistro table to enjoy our morning coffee and tea. We walked around the well manicured grounds. It was clean and lovely. We went out to the beach- beautiful! The front desk people were very helpful and friendly. Check-in late Wednesday evening was a breeze with Kaila. When we went to the airport very early for our son's flight the next morning, I asked Jessica if we might have a late check-out. She offered to let us have the room until 1 pm! We didn't need it, but it was nice to know we didn't have to rush to get everything out. You should know the hotel is in Rio Grande, about 45 minutes east of the San Juan airport (SJU) in weekday morning traffic. It is very convenient for trips to El Yunque, the US Park Systems only tropical rain forest, the ferry at Fajardo to Vieques and Culebra islands. The beach was lovely, with a few reefs just off the shore. They have an on site diving store with equipment and lessons. We booked this room for $102.

My husband had a copy of our Expedia receipt and the attendant made the change immediately. Service: We stayed in a ocean room w/ a king bed the first night. It was a suite style room w/ a door between our room and our neighbor's. There was a screaming child and we could hear our neighbor talking. This was unacceptable. My husband asked for a room change and we were switched to an even better room w/ a better view, although it had two double beds instead of a king. We never heard our neighbor in this new room. I learned that an ocean and ocean front are very different. Our original room was an ocean view and we had to twist our neck to see the ocean. The ocean front room had the ocean front and center in view. At checkout, there was a tiki bar charge that was forged to our room. After pulling my husband's real signature and the forged drink signature, the employee definitely knew the signature was forged and removed the charge. Be careful of people charging things to your room number!!!! Comfort: Our bed and pillows were very comfortable. The drapes had some mold, but I didn't let this bother me.

The breakfast buffet was much better, but $22. (We usually ate off resort at the kioskos or Pasta e Pueblo in Luquillo (HIGHLY RECOMMEND). We ate at Antojitos down the hill and hated it. Huge disappointment.) The resort was beautiful and well kept. We loved the adult pool and hot tubs and that they are open 24 hours. The pool was never overcrowded. We always got a chair.

Here are some other comments: Room: Excellent condition on 6th floor (comparable to hyatt, marriott), very clean, awesome view of ocean, no mold, nice a/c, plenty of space for 4, decent size porch off room with 2 chairs. We didn't have a fridge - bought a $4 cooler at walmart and stocked it with beverages. Great beds, typical hotel TV stations w/ HBO, very clean bathroom. Staff: Fast and efficient check in and check out, housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day, each evening we received a knock on our door and a staff member handed us chocolates and more towels if needed. I had a couple of minor maintenance issues. I screwed up the safe and the door lock broke. Both times, maintenance came right up and fixed the problem. Restaurant staff was great as well - efficient, friendly. Also, received some cold beverages one afternoon for being a Wyndham rewards member. Everyone was very nice. Hotel: The hotel is in great condition with beautiful grounds. Great flowers, palm trees and staff were always working to make things nice. The beach in front of the hotel is immaculate and is cleaned daily. The beach about 1/2 mile away from the hotel and off the hotel property is not as clean, but that is not the hotel's fault. Both pools are very nice. Nice temperature and well sized. Plenty of seating at the pool and beach. We swam at both many times and never had a problem. Grounds are very clean. Saw a few iguanas, but they are fairly innocuous and stay out of the way. Kind of a cool thing to see in the caribbean. The ocean waves were a bit rough for our kids the first day as there were strong winds, but they were perfect the rest of the trip. The inside of the building is beautiful as well - lobby, hallways, elevators, gift shop. Everything was 5 star and the elevators moved very quickly and were always available. The beach closes for lounging around 5pm due to sea turtles, but we could walk and swim on the beach anytime if we had wanted. We ate offsite quite a bit, but did try the lobby bar a couple of times and had great food for dinner at a fairly reasonable price. Also, had the buffet in the main restaurant one night and this was reasonably priced (in comparison to other resort hotels) - $14 - kids and $25 for adults. All you can eat. Parking: Parking is located under the conference facility which is on the west wing of the resort. About a 4 minute walk from the lobby. My last stay at a Hyatt had about the same distance to cover. $15 a day was the fee and i knew this coming in. I didn't let this effect my trip. I would have looked elsewhere if i wanted cheap parking. Staff was very efficient at getting the parking ticket stamped. I originally booked us for just 4 days in an ocean view room, but then extended to 2 more days in a resort view room. When i asked the front desk, about how I should go about moving to the other room, they said, \"don't worry about it, you can stay where you are\". This was really nice as our view was spectacular. The only possible things that could be improved upon was the cost of drinks - very expensive, but resort drink prices are high.

It was a mistake and I feel as though I've wasted my vacation time here. We tried to make the best of the stay and the amenities but unfortunately, the service at this resort falls short of even the common hotel. I am not sure whether it's a drive cut corners and save money, or just a problem with the attitudes of the managers who run your hotel but it does not feel relaxing here and your staff does not seem interested in taking care of guests. The housekeeping staff continue to be outstanding and the beach and pools are very nice. However, there are a number of issues: 1. Bartenders and servers move as if they have nowhere to be and often will arbitrarily overlook someone waiting to buy a $12 drink. There is a single bartender who's done a good job this week, Elain, who is usually at the upstairs bar in the lobby. The bartender who waited on us at Bolero, another of the bars was miserable. He didn't know how to run the server computer, it took 20 min for him to come back with the bottle of wine that we ordered, while we waited with no water or explanation. It took another 20 min for him to ring up our tab so we could go. And, while we stood there, getting poor service, he actually poured himself a Heineken and drank it behind the bar. If I can't get good service, he really has no business treating himself to a drink - if that's even legal here. 2. We tried to visit Shimaz, the Asian restaurant, but it was closed with no notice. The karaoke sign was still up but it too was off with no notice. I tried to get help from the concierge and they tried to send me to some Mexican restaurant down the road with regular run-of-the-mill fried fare. Basically, there was no recommendation for me and my guests for dinner last night. Whether you are busy or not, when you're running a resort where it is hard to get to and from other places (it's 15 min or more by car to anything), the amenities have to be open. You can't close these with no notice because it really puts your guests at an inconvenience. As a result, we really didn't have dinner that night and there was no explanation or apology. 3. The dealers in the casino have no personality, they deal slowly, count slower, and don't make hanging out in there any fun. Have you ever been to a fun casino? Typically there people don't care if they're losing money because it's fun, but here, the dealers seem unhappy and uninterested. I do too. Furthermore, you can't get a drink in the casino and it's about 3000 square feet with a couple of table games and about 100 slots. Very tiny. 4. In general, the food is OK. However, for the prices that they charge for food and drink at the resort, the food isn't up to snuff. 5. When we checked in, it took 4 trips to the front desk to get a set of keys that actually opened our doors. How is that so hard? Also, after the first two trips to the front desk, why didn't someone escort me to my room to ensure that they would work. Or, why didn't the desk clerk offer to buy me a drink while he sorted out the issue instead of continuing to inconvenience the guest. This kind of selfish behavior seems to be prevalent. 6. On Sunday, I asked for an umbrella twice and didn't get one. On the third visit to the umbrella boys, I said, \"Do you remember me?\" The three of them were sitting on their golf cart laughing and chatting. \"Oh yeah, you wanted and umbrella over there right? Sorry about that, we'll get one right over.\" 10 minutes later it finally showed up. Suffice it to say that I won't be coming back here. This isn't restful or fun. The people \"caring\" for your guests don't understand service or hospitality and it's clearly not a priority from the management. I'm embarrassed that I brought my friends along for the trip. They deserve a better vacation - frankly, so do I.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte", "Title": "\u201cDon't invite the people you love to join you at the Rio Mar\u201d", "Author": "xmanxman", "ReviewID": "UR61942902", "Content": "My husband, sister and I were looking forward to an exciting \"first-time\" visit to Puerto Rico just recently.

We were unable to control the temperature the entire stay - even after \"maintenance.\" The air conditioning was so cold, it was almost unbearable. It rained daily - the Rio Mar is 10 minutes from the Rain Forrest. We wanted to watch television some evenings, but were disappointed with the lack of \"free\" channels. We packed DVDs but had no DVD player in the room. We've visited a number of \"Wyndam\" Resorts with conveniences such as these. An expensive resort of this type should not require a fee for every amenity! We were afraid to drink the bottled water provided in the room for fear of an exorbitant charge, but remarkably there was no charge. The beach was in need of maintenance - one could enjoy a long leisurely walk had you not been dodging debris constantly. And, a clean lounge chair would have been nice.

The grounds are beautiful, and very well kept, except for the beach whiich is just plain dirty. The plastic beach chairs are plagued with caked on dirt and don't appear appropriate for anyone to sit on. The beach is littered with plastic bottles, straws, cups and other debris. We visited the beach daily, and the same conditions exist. This beach is the worse carribean beach I've ever been to, and we've been to many. There were crab and lobster washed up on shore, as well as large tree limbs, sea weed, and other sea debris. The pool area was vey nice, but sometime littered with Iguana poop. And, one time at the pool, an Iguana fell out of a tree onto the back of a patron and wouldn't let go for a few seconds.....Yikes!!!! To say the least, a lot of folks at the pool spent the rest of the day looking up at the trees. The hotel rooms, weren't much better than the beach. The first room we checked into had food droppings on the floor, as well as hair on the floor in the bathroom, and a moldy smell. The furnishings were worn, and we were provided with a TV that was a least 20 years old. I complained to bellman, and he immediatly got us a room change. The second room wasn't any better. There was mold everywhere - on the floor, on the curtains, in the bathroom, on the terrace.....mold was everywhere. I complained again to the bellman, and told him the hotel should be clean, and that I felt grossed out how dirty the rooms were. The bellman told hotel management, and he said they were going to call me. They never called. We had a problem with the air conditioner, and had to call 3 times before someone came up to fix it. Hotel management called to ask if the air conditioner waa fixed to our satisfacation, and asked if there was anything else we needed. I told her, Alex, the deplorable condition of the room regarding the mold, and she said the next day, she wpuld have our room scheduled for a deep cleaning.....well it never happen; the mold remained everywhere our entire stay. Several of the staff people could use an attitude adjustment as well. The woman at the front desk the day of our check in was rude and condasending. I asked a staff person in the hallway if he knew where the business center was, and he said \"no\" and kept walking. Another person asked this same person, if he knew where the fitness center was, and he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away. I walked into the Casino or Hotel store, and no one said hi or greeted me. Customer focused they are not! And yes, they nickel and dime you to death for everything. Self parking is $15 per day,and a major hassle. Internet is $14.99 a day in your room, and the 5 free machines in the lobby were very slow, or didn't work. All in all, it was only an OK vacation.

Our room had a simply glorious view of the ocean! Upon arriving at the hotel and checking in, our room smelled heavily of mold (of which I am highly allergic) in the drawers, closet, curtains, dots of mildew on lamp shades. The ceramic tiled floor was not clean and was missing the area rug around the bed as is shown in their web site. None of the rooms have a rug as pictured on the site. There is a lovely balcony with one table and two chairs (dirty also). We have traveled to Puerto Rico many times, but usually stayed in San Juan; we weren't prepared for this. The next day, they moved us into a \"Clean Air\" room at no extra charge. The room was to be equipped with a medical quality air filter, encased mattress, pillows, etc. After getting into the room, we noticed it had none of the above. The staff promptly arrived making the proper preparations. The bed was very comfortable (Pacific Coast Down Pillows) and pillow top mattress. Everyone on the staff (with exception of a surly coffee waitress one evening at the snack shop) were extremely friendly, helpful, welcoming, and accommodating. Our main problem is we felt the hotel and the rooms were not clean and maintained in a fashion we had usually experienced. We usually stay at the Ritz Carlton in San Juan, and this time, decided to try a different area and save $. We have also stayed at the Intercontinental and the El Conquistador. The lack of attention to detail as to cobwebs, clean corners, fallen plaster, etc. was not there. The bath tub in our first room and our second room looked dirty on the bottom, but it was the enamel on the tub showing the cast iron wearing through. There was ample storage and closet space. Robes were available, but you need to request them. Anything we needed, there was someone was at our door immediately. We thought the pool grounds were just as beautiful as Ritz Carlton in San Juan. There was a fully equipped gift shop in which I purchased a few beach dresses and cute beach jewelry. The internet cafe on the lobby level had 5 computers, two of which were broken and one ran slow. I know maintenance is difficult in the tropics, but we were surprised by the lack of it in this resort. The carpeting in Marbella was extremely shabby. The carpeting in the hallways was worn. The paint on the front of the doors was scratched and needed painting. There was fallen plaster in the hall one morning outside our room. There was an area on the ceiling of the room where plaster had fallen at one time and had barely been painted, but the ceiling was not textured. We tried to look beyond all of this because the grounds and the pool areas were divine. The beach isn't groomed as it should be and was difficult if you were to walk along the water line to avoid walking on all of the junk. Even saw a dead,blue rat on our last day when we were walking the beach close to the water. Palio (Italian restaurant) was just wonderful. We dined there twice and each time was memorable. The service was impeccable. I was surprised to read reviews stating the service was bad because we didn't experience that anywhere. I disagree that the food prices in the restaurants are outrageous. They were about the same as in Cleveland where we live. Most drinks at the pool bar are $10.00 and I did think that was steep. They were delicious! They have happy hour at 4:00 where rum punch and their beer is 2 for 1. All of the bartenders are warm and friendly. They have a large bar off the lobby with entertainment and yummy food and apps, a lower smaller bar with a pianist (outside Palio), and a snack shop that served small pizzas, sandwiches, salads, specialty coffees, etc. You could eat at Marbella's brunch every day for $12.00 per person and get everything from omelettes to oatmeal to smoked salmon to the usual. A great value, we thought. The sushi restaurant was nice; unusual drinks with sake as an ingredient were fun. Our visit there was ruined by a large table of adults and four children who were allowed to scream and yell (and I mean loud) the entire time. We weren't happy the casino did not have crap tables. One disburbing thing I also have to mention is I had a surprisingly terrible problem with bug bites (turning into red welts) literally all over my legs, and several on my arms, by the time we left. (In case you are wondering, they were not bed bugs). I had not experience this in Puerto Rico before. I would strongly urge every visitor if you are sitting at the outside bar, spray yourself heavily with bug repellant. We got home yesterday and I was kept awake the last two nights from the pain and itching of the no-seeums. This hotel doesn't put refrigerators in the rooms unless you pay $10.00 a day and I am wondering if they also save money by not spraying for bugs. They do have written material about the no-seeums warning guests of them. My husband started itching today. The technicians at the spa were wonderful. I had two massages while I was there, one by Ellie and one by Barbara; both I would rank tops. I had a Swedish massage the first day and then a Seaweed muscle wrap with a massage. I had wished I had become acquainted with the spa earlier in our trip. I was given recommendations on products (because I asked; not because they wanted to sell things). They have a small gym with the appropriate equipment which I did not use. One night, we ventured to the steak house at the country club/golf club. I thought the food was just o.k. The waiter was pressuring us to order a bottle of wine (we had our fill of drinks at the beach bar all afternoon) and also pressured us to order dessert and coffee. The golf course is gorgeous and the pro shop has beautiful golf attire. All in all, I don't know if I would stay again unless I left special instructions ahead of time to have a clean room. I don't think you should have to spend extra money to have a room clean of mildew.

Waves were a little rough, but we were told this is the way most beaches are in PR. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to an Ocean View Room, which was wonderful with a nice size bathroom and great amenities. The staff was very helpful, friendly and extremely polite. The Dragon Fly staff was also very nice; my mom has a knee issue and is unable to walk for long periods of time. Wanda (our Dragon Fly tour booking person) helped me organize tours that would not require her to walk for too long. During one of the tours, our driver went of her way to drive us around and give us a private tour just so that my mom wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stress out her knee. She even insisted to carry her bags and was very attentive to everything my mom needed. I read many of the reviews before we left, most of the reviewers complained about the price of the food, thus I was prepared to pay whatever came my way, however the truth is that the food was not as pricey as the reviewers claimed. As a native New Yorker, I am used to paying $120 for dinner or $30-40 for a good lunch, so I honestly was not faced by the price tags, plus the food was very good, so why complain.

Thank you once again Carmen for giving my mom that extra bit of attention when she complained of knee spasms. My only complain was the waiting period at the Tiki Bar, it took over 45 minutes to get a hot dog and when I asked the bartender as to why the long wait he just shrugged and walked away!

It is a lovely country, especially because of their scenery, people and delicious food. However, I hated the resort. Rio Mar was EXTREMELY overpriced and they had really bad customer service. The grounds looked nice at first glance, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve traveled to many other places, and I felt that they only went about 80% of the way. Sadly, I felt they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t focus on the small details...so much wasted potential). You would hear people complaining all the time: to the folks that ran the tours (Dragonfly), to the folks in the front desk. They would make mistakes on tours, people were irate and instead of appeasing them, they would insult the guests. I was dumbfounded by their attitude. I think the over pricing was the most frustrating part of it all. For instance, a cup of coffee cost $4.50. I considered a helicopter ride and almost fainted. When I took my family to Hawaii 2 years ago, I paid approximate $250 for each of us to go on a helicopter ride. At this resort, they wanted $3,700 (and that was the cheap ride). We took a few tours. We did Old San Juan, however, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure we were overcharged for it ($100/person). We went horseback riding for about 2 hours ($79/person). I had booked the bio bay tour, but later found out that you could call the bio folks on your own instead of going through Dragonfly and it cost less than half! The resort folks were charging $100/person and the tour actually only cost $45. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a HUGE difference. I HIGHLY recommend renting a car so you can get around and eat elsewhere. But get ready because in addition to renting your car, the resort charges you $20/day to park yourself in their lots! I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it. You also had a choice to have them park it for you (valet service for $25/day). BTW, rooms don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have microwaves and you can have a small fridge installed for $10/day (another rip off). Also, you would think a big resort like that would have computer stations for their guests. Well, they had a total of 5 computers in a narrow hallway near the front desk. 2 of them were out of service the entire time I was there. 1 had a broken keyboard, the other was super slow, so only one worked OK. There were no printers so you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t print out your boarding passes. I was beyond annoyed. The front desk folks were horrible. Make sure you stay on top of them. Not only are they rude, they also tried to charge me for extra services. Upon checking in on our first day (we arrived at about 1pm), they promised that our room would be ready between 3 and 4pm. So we went to eat (at one of their expensive restaurants) and walked along the beach/resort to kill time. We kept checking with them to inquire about our room and were given the runaround. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into a room until 6pm. I was told that ocean front rooms (which I had booked and paid extra for) were in high demand by us folks from the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153states\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As if we are spoiled brats. I was fit to be tied...I complained to the management and they gave me a $50 credit, like that was going to make a dent.

Of course, at the end of the trip, when we went to check out, they refused to give me the credit I was promised on that first day. I had to fight with the manager until they gave it to me. I also paid for airport transfer shuttles when I booked my trip BEFORE arriving in PR ($100 total) and they tried to bill me $150 each way. I felt really frustrated the entire time I was there.

My wife and I booked the Rio Mar on cheapcaribbean .com with no problems for about $120.00 a night and I thought it was a very fair deal. We rented a car for $165.00 through enterpise and their airport shuttle took us to Carolina, where we were quickly on our way down Route #3 to Rio Mar. I don't know why people complain about P.R. drivers! I thought they were great and I'm not a city driver at all. Once we were at the light in front of Rio Mar Blvd, we continued down Route #3, three more lights to the Walgreens & Amigo on the right, so that we could get a cooler for $3.50 and water, beer, soda, sunblock, P.R. t-shirts and bug spray (though we never saw one mosquito for seven days). I won't bore you with the parking fee speech, as I found the valet very speedy. Checking in went smoothly and we got a free upgrad to an oceanview room. The room was PERFECT! No mold, no noise, and very clean. House keeping did a wonderful job. They were always stopping to ask if we needed any extra towels or anything (they even organized my meds on the bathroom shelf, which I thought was very cool). So we left a little tip each day. The bars... this is where I get somewhat miffed. $10.50 for a (maybe) 8 oz. drink! But the service in the lobby bar was the best (Silvia, a waitress, was very pleasant and always took time to ask if we were enjoying our stay). Dining. We tried Marabellas twice, once for dinner and breakfast. We loved it, because it was so conveinent to stroll into (we all know it's a bit high priced, but hey, we were on vacation). The grounds are wonderfully kept and just a treasure to behold. The iguana in the day are a great point of interest for the young and young at heart (make sure to save some lettuce to feed them; it's a blast) and at night the Coqui frogs all sound as if they are talking to each other. It's definitely beautiful to listen to while having a Pina Colada on the balcony of the lobby bar. We loved the beach and its great breeze. There's nice waves to play in, lots of fun in the sun... the Tikki bar is okay, but didn't stay open long enough. All in all, I would have to say is that if you want to be in northeast P.R. this is the place to be. Even if you choose to do your trip on a tight budget, just do your research here on TA and find all the little things that save big. Rent a car and drive right across the street to El Yunque, book tours through tour companies directly, Kiosks are good for dining, Old San Juan is great and cheap, and Walgreens or Amigo has anything you might need.

We would have loved a fridge but did not feel like paying the rental fee ($10 a day) for something that should have been complimentary. The pool, beach, and hotel grounds are gorgeous and well maintained. While the beach does close at 6pm--this is due to the nesting season of sea turtles and is completely out of the resorts control and not at all inconvenient. While I enjoyed my 4 day stay with two friends, the cost of everything left a sour taste in my mouth the entire time. As other guests have mentioned, the food here is very overpriced. I live in the DC metro area and do usually pay $20-$30 for a dinner entree, but the quality of the food at Rio Mar does not nearly meet the price you pay. My first night there, I spent $30 for a drink, spinach salad, and soup. A breakfast of coffee and fruit cup will cost you $10. There is no economical option so each night I was spending around $50 for food, drink and tip (they even charge a fee for splitting an entree!). If I wanted a cocktail this was even more. A lot of other guests were renting cabs ($60 round trip) to go out of the resort and buy snacks and drinks and bring them back in coolers. While this does keep you from eating food from the Tiki Bar (which caused me a night of suspected food poisoning), you still must find dinner on your own. If I had been traveling with my husband, I would have felt more comfortable leaving the resort to find restaurants with more local flavor and lower cost. The hotel gift shop offers very little in way of fun souvenirs, and like everything else, was very overpriced. A family spent $25.00 for one box of benedryl for their sick child while my friend paid $8 for a bag of pretzels. Upon checkout, we found $100 in extra \"room fees\" for who knows what. Parking a car is $20 a day on top of the car rental fee. The hotel shuttle cost more than for a group to take a cab to and from the hotel ($60). Although I got the room for a very nice price, the cost of food/beverages and all the extra \"fees\" Wyndham applies to every service would have made an all-inclusive much more affordable.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "borntoexplore", "ReviewID": "UR60977904", "Content": "As another reviewer we stayed at the \"Villas\" at Rio Mar (one-bedroom condo with kitchen) and not in the hotel itself.

I read alot of reviews before and had alot of advice from previous travelers. Tips: Rented a car, Rented a Fridgerator for the room ($20 total), Eat off the Resort, bring your laptop and wifi card for internet access. Rooms: The room was just perfect!! Very spacious. We had 4 people staying in the room, 2 of them teenagers and we had plenty of space for clothes and personal belongings. The bathroom had a great set up with a long shelf over the sink area. The balcony was great and the view was amazing. We had coffee every morning out on the balcony and listened to the surf. The beds were super, super comfy!! Rented the refridgerator and had lots of room for drinks and snacks. Resturants: We didnt eat at the Resort at all. I love trying new places and enjoying the local culture. We went to Luquillo Kiosks and ate at LaParilla, Jefe Burger and the Italian place. Lolita's was great mexican food and Antonjitos was FANTASTIC! Service: The service here was wonderful! Checkin was a breeze and they had unexpectedly provided us with an ocean/garden view. The view was so beautiful! Housekeeping was great, our room was always clean and tidy when we came back from the day. Grounds: The resort is beautiful with its lush gardens. The green lawn areas in front of the ocean was great for the children. I loved seeing the kids play a game of soccer or fly a kite. The iguanas loved the lawn. Pools: The pools were warm and wonderful. We really enjoyed our afternoon and evening pool time. They do not close the pool off for the night. Which is great to swim at night and play a game of pool volley ball and sit in the hot tubs... which were very warm. Beach: The beach was great, very pretty and plenty of beach chairs. I loved jumping the waves and spending lots of time in the ocean. There wasnt any coral/rocks. But we did find live sand dollars. The beach was great to take a long walk on. A little stroll from the hotel lead you to the river that came out to the sea. The view was amazing with the background of the El Yunque . Toured El Yunque on our own and walked the trail to LaMina falls. Also went on the Catamaran Sailing Snorkel trip to the outer islands. That was a wonderful day at the beach and snorkeling reef had a lot to offer. The water was clear and there were many fish and plant life. I followed a long deep cavern and looked really, really hard and found a very sleepy shark just sitting in his little cave. Prior to Wyndham, we spent 3 nights in Rincon, and that was completely different than the East side of Puerto Rico. Surfed and Snorkeled on the West side. See my review under Rincon of the Seas. I drove all over this island and loved every minute of it! The little mountain side roads were beautiful for sight seeing and was pleasantly surprized to find a beautiful lake in the middle of the interior. We also ventured off near San Sebastian to see the Gozanlandia waterfall, which in my opion was better than Mina falls.

The public areas of the hotel are very pretty, but the rooms and hallways are 1970's Holiday-Inn style all the way. The pool area is lovely, close to a great beach. There is a large hot tub adjacent, which was crowded with a million kids...some jumping in...you couldn't really relax in it. By the end of the day I thought it smelled pretty heavily of urine, but I think that is because the hotel was crowded with spring break families. The location.. close to El Yunque is good....we did some excellent hiking there. We had a car for our entire stay...which I do recommend since there isn't anything to do off property that is walking distance. As far as meals....we ate our one \"fancy\" meal in Palio....excellent...highly recommend and worth the 150 for the four of us (with a bottle of wine for my husband and I) Other eating venues seemed overpriced and not as good. We ate off property a lot. Would absolutely recommend Antojitos down the hill for breakfast or dinner (2 dollars for a plate of pancakes!!!) Dinner for the four of us there the first night..30 dollars!! We also ate at \"Richies\" (up the hill)...beautiful view but overpriced. There is a new place next door to Richies.....\"Terraza Montemar\"...same view (though not open-air) and much less expensive...very friendly service. I would visit PR again but not stay in this resort. Our room had a lot of (unfixable) problems. The ventilation system blew out musty foul smelling air and had to be off for the whole trip. Our sliding glass door did not have a screen, so we had to choose between bugs or stinky air. The hotel was \"full\" and they couldn't move us. They also told us upon check-in that we would not be given any Wyndym credit for our stay (even though we are members) because we booked it through Expedia!!! We could not bathe our kids in the tub because there was not drain plug...not a problem for our age kids but if I had toddlers, I'd be pretty unhappy about that. I thought people, in general, seemed overwhelmed and unwilling to help...perhaps because of the crowds. The last comment I want to add is about the garbage around the pool and beach. Yes...it is there and I couldn't stand it. But why are people leaving garbage around in the first place? There are cans everywhere.

We had stayed at the El Conquistador before and decided to try something different. Note that we stayed at the \"Villas\" at Rio Mar (we had a suite with kitchen) and not in the hotel itself. Here are our observations. The location of this resort is ideal - about 30-40 minutes from San Juan and about 10 minutes from El Yunque National Park (rainforest). The beach was fantastic - perfect sand, warm water and long rolling waves every day which were ideal for bodysurfing or riding a on board. The pool at the Villas was also excellent - zero entry (good for little kids) with an infinity feature on the oceanside. The downside to the Villas was that they were a bit dated - looked like they \"needed a little love\" and weren't getting it. Air conditioners are loud and very old. There were rust spots around the building/unit that needed attention. Our unit had several easily preventable problems during our stay (including a/c) - which necessitated working with the staff and being annoyed that someone hadn't addressed these problems prior to our stay. The staff/superindendant were nice - but I didn't feel they were empowered to immediately fix things (unlike at other vacation spots we have stayed - such as Sanibel, Florida). In terms of value for money, our Villa was really over-priced given its condition. The relationship with the resort itself was mixed - you couldn't easily wander over to the main pool as there were guards checking if you were hotel guests. If not, you couldn't use the hotel pool (which was very crowded anyway). The restaurants at the resort were so-so - not as good as at the El Conquistador (with the exception of Palio (the Italian restaurant). We didn't golf or play tennis - but those facilities looked excellent. If you are deciding between El Conquistador and Rio Mar, Rio Mar has a beach right on the resort - at El Conquistador, you have to take a boat to a private island to swim at the beach (i.e., you can't swim in ocean on a whim at El Conquistador). However, the private island does offer excellent snorkeling (which you don't have at Rio Mar). Rio Mar is also very close to El Yunque which offers great hiking and scenery. El Conquistador is much more upscale and you feel like the resort was constantly reinvesting to make it better - at Rio Mar, from the landscaping (hardly any flowers) to the restaurants to the lodging, you felt that the resort was just milking an existing asset and not committed to improving it. I guess that is understandable given the lack of any competition in the immediate area from other resorts. In closing, if you want to hike in the rain forest (many trails), have a great beach and be relatively close to San Juan, this is a decent choice.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure where to start with this litany of failed promises, sham reservations, inept housekeeping and pass-the-buck policies. What follows are the \"highlights\" of my list of ten failures evident at check in: There was a used, wet towel in the bathroom . There were dead bugs on the furniture . There were leftover condiments from room service on the table. The floor was dirty enough to discolor my socks in minutes. The air conditioning did not appear to be cooling the room. The interior of the refrigerator was not cold. With respect to the refrigerator, the freezer unit was caked in ice at least three inches thick in spots. I removed the ice and the refrigerator seems to be working better. All minor failures, to be sure. But major failures, taken together, especially when a property bills itself as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grand Resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd does not deliver on the basics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c clean rooms, attentive housekeeping, honored reservations -- of a first class, let alone premier, destination. Shortly after check-in Wednesday. My SO went downstairs to inquire about the charges for internet usage in the room. She was told by one of the front desk personnel that if she were a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBy Request\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 member, the daily internet charges against would be reversed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Would you like to be a member?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she was asked. Of course, she responded. And after she completed a membership form, she was assured that the charges would be waived. Imagine her surprise, then, when she was told Thursday that she was wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and notice I emphasized \u00e2\u20ac\u0153she\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was wrong. Another member of your front desk staff told her this morning that the charges would NOT be waived. The reason? She had not been a member for the required three days. Please note that this person did not explain to her that the membership didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count until AFTER she had checked out. When she inquired about the room promised for her daughter after 11 am April 1, 2010, she was told by a member of your front desk staff that it would be taken care of today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that someone from the desk would call on her cell phone. By this time, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you will not be surprised (we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) when we returned to the hotel after 9 pm tonight to learn that nothing had happened. No phone call. No separate room. No explanation. Just more broken promises. So when we talked with you, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprising that you said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a room for her tomorrow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe you then and I still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. As I said to you, we are leaving Saturday. Put us off one more night and the problem we represent has boarded a flight back to the states. And then? I come back to the room our daughter must sleep in, on a fold out sofa bed for the second consecutive night (not to worry, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take care of it tomorrow, promise!) and the air conditioning units don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I call for service; the engineer arrives and tells me after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repairing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one of the units that the room will be cool in about an hour. That was more than an hour ago and the room is not cool. The second air conditioner in the room? Motor is too hot, so the engineer goes to talk to you. Your response? You will have a room for her \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tomorrow. And tonight? Let her sleep on the sofa bed in 80+ degrees \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again. And the inoperative air conditioning? Still inoperative the next morning. And the room is clammy warm as a result. It seems to be corporate policy here to tell the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd anything to postpone the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd until tomorrow. And this seems frighteningly transparent; my experience suggests your staff is terrible presenters of what polite society would not refer to as lies. They seem to be saying what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re told to say \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take care of it tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c knowing full well that while the complaint won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go away, the complainer will. We checked out Saturday, as planned. Never the second room we were promised from the moment we checked in. Our daughter slept on a sofa bed for three nights -- despite the fact that we paid for a separate room for her, for three nights. Before I sent the email from which this review is extracted, I stopped by the General Manager's office -- initially to get an email address. I was invited in to the office and had a very pleasant and I hope informative conversation with the General Manager. She took immediate action on our behalf. She was gracious in her generosity.

Very convenient layout--pool and beach are right by the hotel. There is an adult pool, a kid pool and a baby pool. The kid pool is nice because large sections never go above 3'6\" so even kids who are not great swimmers can have fun and get around in the water. My daughter loved the simple things, like the iguana feedings and hair braiding each morning. It is also a very convenient location if you want to visit El Yunque or Luquillo Beach. Not too far from the bioluminescent bay at Fajardo either though it can take a while in traffic. I met some guests there who were happy with the tennis and golf facilities--I don't play either sport so can't speak to that. That said, I do want to alert you to issues with the rooms. Our room on the 2nd floor had a serious mold problem. Unfortunately we didn't notice until it was too late to change rooms the first night. I'm talking mold on the drapes, the walls, the closet doors, possibly even part of the duvet. A guidebook looked like it had been soaked in water after we left it out for a few hours. After the first night they moved us to a special \"clean room\" on the 5th floor where everything is hypoallergenic and they run an air purifier. No mold problems there. It had a mountain view, which was fine with us, but it also was set up for someone in a wheelchair, which was not so great because all we had was a showerstall with a handheld showerhead, and the sink counter was so high my daughter could not reach the faucets. But after I spoke to the front desk staff they did give us a credit for our first night and they did not charge us for a refrigerator. Overall I feel like they were responsive to our concerns and tried to improve the situation, but be sure to request one of their special clean rooms if you want to avoid the moisture problem. Otherwise, the rooms are nice and the beds are excellent. I thought the food at the resort was overpriced but our daughter loved the buffet restaurant. We ate at Ricky's up the hill one night, and that place had pretty good food but cost about the same as the food at the resort. (Better view though.) We also ate at a few local places that were much cheaper, at the bottom of the hill: Antojito's and Isamem Bakery. Antojito's is pretty good and popular with the locals. We met Roberto Clemente's son there at dinnertime. Isamem is cheap but the guy behind the counter could not remember that we had ordered coffee and milk along with the food. Final tip: If you want to go on one of the outdoor excursions I would suggest contacting the tour operator directly, not through the resort, to make your reservation. Someone told me that they charged a big markup for the kayak tour of the bioluminescent bay. We booked a tour directly with Captain Suarez, who runs an electric boat.

First of all the Weather change was stunning because of a 20 degrees difference from the philadelphia are and PR. Rental car lines were vicious, but I paid in advance, and fill the tank up yourself and save around 15 -20 bucks. PR is very similar to most other U.S. spots so finding your way around isnt hard unless your in old san jaun, whcih is pretty much the hood and has very tight streets. The Hotel was Unbelievable, really sharp and after the intial amazment, then come the FEES. 15 dollars a day to self park, have to get it validated everyday in order to leave the garage. YOU MUST GET A RENTAL CAR, IF NOT, DO NOT GO HERE!! CABS ARE A RIPOFF Up the road on ESTE 3 there is a walmart in Farajado, and also alot of stores that remind you of home. Spanish people speak both english and spanish in most cases, but you ocasionally get one or two act like they dont speak so they dont have to be bothered with you. Rain Forest was HOT, free just across ESTE 3 from the resort just follow the signs Barcardi Factory tour(San Jaun) was wack and felt like a high school field trip, you just watch movie. The FREE rum they give you is worth it! Get a small foam cooler and get your do it fluid at walmart and a few other stores that sell boo's. SAVE MONEY cause the hotel will charge like 20 for a 6 pack of corona, and at the walmart they are 4.97 I am a huge drinker so I loved that. Resturants at the Hotel were expensive and they charged 120 to rent a jet ski for a half an hour. Overall I loved the hotel and my girlfriend cried the last day because she didnt want to leave, but she got it together.

The week we were there, (Mar. 29-Apr. 3), this hotel was perfect for our needs. The hotel is beautiful, and our room was very nice with an ocean front view. The beach was wonderful, and the weather was great all week. The employees were all friendly, with some going above and beyond - a special thanks to Carlos Rosa who brought us beach chairs and an umbrella from all the way at the other end of the beach when we came out late one morning. Because we'd read lots of reviews, we knew to rent a car and not eat at the overpriced restaurants on the property. As every review of this hotel mentions, the parking charges are ridiculous. But at least we knew what to expect, and the $90 we spent on parking for the week was well made up for by what we saved on food and sightseeing by having our own car. This was one of our favorite vacations as a family, we all had a great time and really enjoyed our stay at the Wyndham. We would definitely go there again. Some tips: *requesting a fridge in your room costs $10 per day. A cheap styrofoam cooler at Walmart costs under $5. Ice at the hotel is free. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is $19 per person, plus a $4 carafe of coffee. Just by using the cooler for milk, eating cereal in the room for four mornings, I estimate that our family of four saved around $400. *When we were in the mood for a full breakfast, we went to Antojitos (right at the bottom of the hill) and spent only about $5 per person. The food was great. *You will see lots of signs for Richie's Cafe up the hill from the resort. Having seen some TripAdvisor reviews, we went for the gorgeous view and kept our expecations reasonable for the food. Yes, the view is incredible, but even considering our lowered expectations, the food was barely average and the service was ridiculously bad. Cost for our family of 4: $85. Later in the week we learned that if you keep driving a few hundred more feet up the hill, you will come to a restaurant called Terrazzo Montemar. Same gorgeous view, with wonderful food - and half the price of Richie's- highly recommended. *The Kioskos in Luquillo are not to be missed. They are a row of beachfront shacks right off Highway 3. We went twice for delicious lunches that cost our family of four less than $20. Yum. *In our opinion, the $20 valet parking wasn't worth it. After arriving late the first night and using valet, we switched to $15 self park for the rest of the week. We actually preferred getting our own car (quick and easy) to waiting around for them to bring it. *Do online research and reserve your rental car ahead of time. The hotel has an Avis desk, but obviously you'll spend more that way. We found the best deal by far with Thrifty in San Juan.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ormond beach, florida", "Title": "\u201cA Little Bit of Heaven\u201d", "Author": "slip32174", "ReviewID": "UR60243394", "Content": "The resort was beautiful with a lush tropical setting that was kept clean and beautiful.. the staff was attentive and courteous, the rooms were beautiful, very clean and was about as sound proof as I've ever found in a hotel.

The grounds of the Wyndam Rio Mar are beautiful, so is the beach. They keep the lobby clean and attractive as well. However, don't be fooled. It took five room changes before we got a decent room. The first smelled of mold, although attractive looking. We changed to a second room and people were sleeping in it. The hotel computer was not up to date. The third room stunk of smoke, in a no smoking hotel. By this time, the fourth room was just ok but we took it because we were so tired. The next day I asked for a change. Finally got a decent room after 5 tries. Management did reimburse us a few dollars for our troubles. Food is very expensive and the hotel is 40 minutes from San Juan. Breakfast buffet costs $25 p/p and if you don't want the expense, you can wait on line at the Express Kiosk and pay $20 for two coffees, two bagels, and one muffin. The length of time on the kiosk line is upwards of 25 minutes. Therefore, you will need to rent a car. Here in is another story. Avis was going out and Enterprise was coming in. The hotel did nothing to ease the transition of the two companies. Therefore, we were unable to get a car at the hotel for two days. Then there is the $25 parking fee if the hotel parks for you. If not, there is a $15 parking fee which is the most cumbersome I have ever experienced. First you park. Then you get a ticket. When you are ready to retrieve your car, you have to to go outside to the valet desk, get the ticket validated, walk back into the hotel, go down three levels to the garage and retrieve your car. It turns out that the parking is outsourced, as is the food consession, as are most services in this hotel. So, the left hand does not know or care what the right hand is doing. Now let's talk about the beach. You have to sign out for towels, so there is a line to get the towels and a line to bring them back. When you go to the beach, they give you a beach chair and an umbrella for free. That is great. However, you wait on a line, then you point to the spot you want. The beach chairs are brought over, then the umbrella never comes. If you opt to pay for a cabana for $150 for the day, you receive a cooler filled with expired soda and water. Fruit is supposed to come, one small cup was given to us. Otherwise, we were completely ignored. A young couple i met, booked the hotel online. They did not read the fine print and were charged a $32 daily resort fee in addition to the agreed upon price. The hotel does not have wifi unless you pay for it. I was so tired of paying for everything, I refused to spend another dime on the internet. All in all, if you think the Wyndam will give you quality and service, look for another place to stay. You think you have a pretty good deal and then you have to pay for everything that in most places is given to you.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cProperty beautiful, rooms pretty awful\u201d", "Author": "Tink1234", "ReviewID": "UR60111850", "Content": "So it is with a heavy heart that I write this review because I think this COULD be a great hotel (and two years ago I wrote a glowing review) and honestly, our family had a great time, but there are some serious issues here that have only gotten worse in the last two years. The main issues are - - the condition of the rooms - this goes from OK to atrocious. There has been clearly no upkeep over the past two years. We had to go to THREE rooms until there was one that was decent. The first one I was maybe a little picky about (our reservation was \"partial ocean view\" - fine, I expect to see just partial but in that room, you could see the ocean if the palm trees swayed just so and you stood at the edge of the balcony. And the worst part was when I called to complain the front desk told me \"here, if you can even see a sliver of ocean it is considered partial\". This, hotel management, is going to tick off your guests before they have even unpacked. A SLIVER frankly should be resort view - you make a few less bucks but your guests get what they thought they paid for.) I digress. So the second room was appalling. The smell of mildew was overwhelming, everything in the room was wet b/c clearly the dehumidification system was not working for some reason, and the curtain was torn and filthy. Really, I haven't seen a room like that in years. I thought about just crying uncle and asking for our old room back but when we went to get our luggage it was already occupied by a guy who said the door on their first room wouldn't lock no matter what they did! I was a little sheepish about asking for another room and tried to make the best of it for the night but when the adjoining room turned out to be loud honeymooners, I had to do something and I need to give credit where credit is due, the overnight front desk person gave us a spectacular room that was clean and had a lovely view. So it ends happily but based on the conversation poolside, SO many people were upset about their rooms that our first two rooms were likely more representative. But let me make this clear, the problem was not with housekeeping - they did fine, it was that nothing was being kept up or updated. It seemed like if something was dirty or torn, it was going to stay that way. - the food (other than the ERL Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and the poolside cafes which had pretty good food with expected resort-level pricing) is really expensive. This can be handled by renting a car and eating your meals off-site. But woe is he who has no car and is trapped. We loved eating out and getting the car from the parking garage was no problem at all. You will have to pay for parking, but where don't you?? - the service - everyone is friendly but there is not one bit of pampering going on here. So not a big deal if that isn't important to you, as it wasn't to us, but if it is, this may not be the place for you. Like I said, it isn't a big deal to us - all we need is for people to be friendly and they were that without exception. On the bright side, the waves are perfect for boogie boarding, the beach is lovely and the outdoor areas are pleasant and well-maintained. We rented Cabana #18 for two days and that made our vacation as the cabanas give you guaranteed shade, are stocked with snacks and drinks, have comfy chairs and #18 has the perfect vantage point to watch your kids and have privacy. Really lovely. Add to that the proximity to El Yunque and the great food a short drive away and it is a good vacation, but it is not for everyone. I THINK maybe that is why half the reviews are awesome and the other just awful. If you want to just spend a lot of time outside by the pool, playing in the perfect waves, seeing the rain forest, then you'll have a great time. If you want a luxurious experience with updated, beautiful rooms and VIP service (and there is nothing wrong with that on vacay!), this may not be the best choice.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCould be nicer\u201d", "Author": "Wfbtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR60081420", "Content": "We've only been here for two days and already want to leave.

We stayed on the fourth floor and had a breathtaking view of the El Younqe rainforest. There was even a small pond setting outside of our window that was complete with iguanas, turtles, goldfish and even some bats in the early morning. What a beautiful way to start the day! The pool areas were very clean and the lobby is gorgeous, very open and airy. The concerige staff were very helpful with questions and general information. Thanks to other TripAdvisor members we did rent a car and were very happy with that decision. We also used the valet service and would recommend that to everyone. The downfalls to this hotel are very overpriced food, poor restocking by housekeeping and not much effort from the front desk when there is a problem. We ate lunch at the Tiki bar our first day. The total amount for 4 burgers with fries, 3 lemonades and one tap water was approximately 75.00 USD (with tip). The burgers were good enough but we chose not to eat on property again. There are several nice restaurants, kiosks and stands close by with excellent food. The other two problems we encountered were that I had reserved 2 rooms (adjoining) one for my husband and me, the other for my 19 year old daughter and her 18 year old friend. When we checked in we were told the girl's room would be ready in about an hour. We took our bags upstairs, ate and when my daughter went to the desk to get her room key we found out they had given their room away. Luckily they were able to put them two doors down but it was still a bit inconvienient. The thing that bothered me the most was the condescending attitude of the man at the desk. I don't think he understood or cared that one of the girls had never been \"away from home\" and was a bit nervous. The other issue was with housekeeping. I give them an A+ with cleaning but not with restocking. This was a daily issue and even included running out of toilet paper. One morning my daughter's friend informed me that housekeeping had taken her \"feminine hygeine\" products that she had left on the top of the toilet. When I said something to the front desk the reply was \"that's strange but there is nothing we can do about it\". However, they did send up the shampoo and soap that hadn't been filled. Overall, I really enjoyed the hotel because of the cleanliness and views. The location was great but I don't think I would stay again because of high priced food, lack of stocking and the lack of rectifying the room situation. I felt as if the place was a money pit and we day travelled quite a bit, so for us it really wasn't worth the price we paid.

Don't be alarmed if you see random horses tied or untied to traffic poles. I'm not kidding. Our driver from Dragon Fly explained that people are very good to their horses in PR and it's not uncommon for people to donate monies for care? Mmm. If you arrive on a Saturday, horse parades are common on the Main Streets. -Upon arrival, you will check in and be escorted to your room with your luggage. They speak FAST regarding where everything is located on the resort. Don't try to comprehend it. They offer no resort maps. Rio Mar is large and it will take a few days to get your bearing straight, especially how to get down to the pool from the elevators. -My first impression of my room was the over whelming smell of mold . It was terrible. I've stayed at many tropical destinations and by far this was the worst. When I got back home..my suitcase and clothing smelled horrible. No joke. As far as cleanliness, the attention to detail was not there. There was nothing \"special\" about the room which was an upgrade ocean view of the top of palms trees..just smelly and sub-par cleaned. I can say though, my bed was very comfortable. My patio furniture was rusty so I used bath towels to cover the seats and table. -The hotel food is not good, below average, and VERY EXPENSIVE. An average course buffet cost $24.99 US per person and if you drink, you will pay and pay dearly. We usually grabbed something light from the small coffee cafe at the entrance of the casino. Go off hotel property, eat dinner or buy groceries. Many guests we talked to did that. There are no refrigerators in the rooms we stayed in. Ask other guests, especially at the pool. People love to talk about good and not so good food. Rio Mar will provide transportation for a small fee. Do it, it's so worth it. ~ Hacienda Carabali is an amazing Paso Fino farm with an excellent restaurant. The steaks are to die for! Everything was excellent and the prices are very reasonable. We ate there 3 evenings and watched the horses in the arena. Incredible. Hacienda is only a 10 minute ride from Rio Mar. We also ate at a local seafood restaurant called La Parilla. AMAZING whole red snapper! Delicious. Another 10 minute ride. It's worth it. -There are two pools and two hot tubs. One for adults and one for children. Pool chairs are a premium. Get yours early or you will not have one. We found it odd that the bar and music was at the kiddie pool? Music was erratic. Some days you could hear it at the adult pool other days,nothing. Service is slow and hit or miss at the pool. At times it was several hours before staff would come back around. We did complain loudly to the front desk as well as several other guests that pool cleaning crews were hosing and cleaning the pools mid-day. Cleaning crews were spraying some unknown cleaner on the sides of both pools. NO ONE LIKED THAT! Pool skimmers were often FULL of debris and a light scum floated on the water. It's attention to detail that this resort lacks. Everyone thought it was very strange the resort didn't attend to the pool at night but in the middle of the day and cleaning staff were not dressed shall I say in proper attire, shirtless or without shoes was a bit odd at a resort. Be aware of the LARGE number of Iguana's roaming around the pools. We were quite disappointed that staff would often walk around iguana droppings without notifying someone to clean large masses of runny, disgusting \"piles\". Our group ended up putting bar napkins on top of them. GROSS. -The Beach. Don't expect white sugar sand beaches. The beach is mocha brown, they do not rake. It was dirty with plastic debris, dead fish and sea greens. Shells are limited but if you wade out past your waist, we found multitudes of sand dollars. The surf can be rough be careful of the undertow. It's sea turtle nesting time, the beach closes at 5pm. If you walk to the right ,past the jet ski rental you will find a fresh water river. Don't go by yourself and yes, you can cross the mouth of the river. It was stunning, clear and lush. -Resort Grounds. You will find a vast majority of the grounds unoccupied. The are large empty fountains, flower pots and cabana's. The golf clubhouse and greens are TERRIBLE. We walked extensively and noticed the clubhouse nearly run down but open and the tennis courts vacant. What a shame. Totally under utilized. Large broken pots and yard debris littered around the courts. Shame. Once inside, you will notice the same thing. Rio Mar is a huge resort. Many of the common areas set empty. The maintenance and overall appearance of the interior is dirty, not filthy but just not clean. Example. You know your stair banister rails, the ones you hold on to walk down the steps? We noticed extreme wear/dirt on the tops of the rails. Dirty, where everyone holds onto. The ceilings and moldings are split and or cracked especially around the main bar area. Just look up. Many people we spoke with at the pool complained of the overall cleanliness of the resort and lack at attention to detail. It's a sub-par resort at best with no night life. The resort shuts down around 7pm. You will find people out walking around the pools and the occasional swimmer but there is no night life, no music, no activities. -Spa. What can I say. My friend and I toured the spa. The receptionist was very unfriendly and the services are extremely overpriced. Nearly $280.00 US for a 30 minutes massage and wrap. I passed. You will find spectacular views of the rain forest if you choose a mountain view room. It's stunning. One of our consultants stay in a mountain view room. The photos are lovely. If you expect an Iberostar or Excellence quality resort then you will be disappointed. Rio Mar is 45 minutes from San Juan, no night life and the food is sub-par, expensive. Attention to detail is lacking. Cleanliness is questionable. Service was terrible. Overall, our experience was poor-fair. We survived but without a doubt will not return. This resort needs much needed TLC along with a major change in menu. Our group spoke objectively to many guests and by far they were unhappy with Rio Mar.

Go to Ralphs right up Hwy 3 for snacks and drinks! We ate at Richie's and yes it is overpriced, and the food is just okay. I think you are really paying for the spectular view so make sure you go while there is still daylight. The coffee shop at the end of the hill is the place to be for breakfest!

Parking is expensive, but we paid to $20 per day to valet and let me tell you it was worth it. They will pull your car around as many times as you need it. It was worth the extra five bucks plus tip not to have to walk to the parking garage.

We used to prefer the oceanfront villas, but now we really like the \"golf villas\", cheaper and quieter. The new oceanfront project (Ocean 16) has ruined the coastline and the view, and is really an eyesore that looks totally out of proportion with the rest of the resort. This, and other detalis seem to have the resort on a slippery slope. The roads are in the worst condition I've ever seen. The hotel restaurants keep increasing prices but not the quality. The pool area is usually so packed, we have opted to do other activities, like staying more on the beach or jogging around the resort, which is quite refreshing, especially around the mangrove areas. Wyndham seems to be penny pinching when it comes to ammenities. One would expect more ammenities as the resort grows, but actually there are less. The tennis courts are unique in PR, because they are clay, and although we do not play tennis often, we always play at least once on our Rio Mar vacations. The courts and the area need TLC, but are still nice to play. The golf courses also need TLC. The magnificent Ocean course has been massacred by the huge Ocean 16 project and by the shortening of a signature hole - hole 15. I heard they plan to shorten other holes. Some juniors and college players that play there every year told us this was their last year because of the bad condition of the courses and this shortening of the holes. Why on earth would they do this!? We found the courses to be ok, but not worth the price compared to others in PR, and less challenging. They should seriously consider adding ammenities instead of shortening or eliminating them. For example, the gymn is extremely small, and only for hotel guests. There are no walking trails, just one short jogging trail. Walking and jogging is becoming dangerous with the increased traffic. All in all, Rio Mar is still a nice place to spend a vacation, but they should not continue this slippery slope of deterioration and disregard to the concept and the needsJust in case, we are looking for alternatives.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cBEAUTIFUL resort; pricey travel & food\u201d", "Author": "ncsuwolfpackfan", "ReviewID": "UR59185897", "Content": "Everything about the resort was absolutely beautiful.

The food at the cafe next to the casino was very good but slightly pricey. Shima's food was not good at all and excessively over priced. Would not recommend the restaurant. The service at the Tiki Bar was TERRIBLE. The staff was not friendly, the drinks were WAY over priced, and were lacking in the alcohol amounts that you were paying for (ie. $15 for 12 oz. drink filled mostly with ice). I would defiantly recommend renting a car while you were here. The AVIS staff was very friendly and helpful. The price of a small 4-door car for one day is $150. Parking in the parking garage is around $15/day and parking around San Juan can be anywhere from $10-20/day. The shuttles at the resort were extremely, extremely, extremely over priced. I came with a group of 5 and leaving the resort to get lunch and stop at a gas station 1 mile down the road was $40. The taxis aren't much better. We walked to the store and got a taxi ride back to the hotel and paid $30. Most of the shuttle drivers were very friendly and gave good advice for places to eat, nightlife, and excursions adventures. We chose to do the Bio-Bay tour out of Farjardo instead of the ferry ride or plane to Vieques. The company we chose was Kayaking Puerto Rico which was excellent.

It's not by any means a luxurious resort but the room was pretty clean and the staff was nice and helpful. PROS: * Bath and Body Works Spa toiletries (including after-sun cooling gel) * Clean resort grounds * Have staff to help you set up umbrellas and lounge chairs where you want on the public beach (they run out of umbrellas by 11am though, so if you must have one, go down early!) * Adult only pool (although the pool with the screaming kids is right near by) * Rooms have balconies CONS: * Rooms have VERY thin walls. You can hear EVERYTHING. * Slightly musty smell in the room (but PR is quite humid so maybe this can't be helped?) * No bath robes provided * Sand in drawers and sand in the bath tub when we checked in * While the sand on the beach is for the most part soft, I got several splinters from the little pieces of wood lying just below the surface of the sand. * Elevators are SLOW. We found the back stairs and just opted for those each time. * Meals are really expensive and add up quickly. OTHER TIPS - including where to eat :) 1) Seriously, RENT A CAR!! The resort is not really walking distance from anything except its own golf course and taxis are expensive. Tours that the resort offers are also really expensive (pretty much at least $100/person). Best to do stuff on your own. Self-parking is $15/day (we did this and didn't find it to be a hassle) and valet is $20/day. Rent the car from the airport, not from the resort which has Avis on site. You'll get cheaper rates if you don't go through the resort. We scored a rate of only $17/day at Enterprise. Because we had a car, we were able to enjoy our dinners and evenings outside the resort where you can find much cheaper and much better food! The first night, we went to Lolitas (a pretty good Mexican restaurant - entree platters are around $10-14, beer $3/bottle). Next night we went to La Parilla - yummy seafood place but more expensive ($25-35 for entrees). We shared the fried snapper stuffed with lobster and it was good. However, my favorite dinner was at Pasta y Pueblo. Although we didn't have a reservation, we were able to be seated outside where we ate dinner on a long board in candle light! So fun and the food was absolutely DELICIOUS. (You might want to make reservations though because the number of tables is quite limited and people without reservations do get turned away. They do 5pm, 7pm and 9pm seatings.) We had the mahi-mahi on pesto pasta and the coconut curry shrimp on coconut rice. Both dishes were really really wonderful but I have to say that I had never had mahi-mahi that was so tender and juicy. I wanted to go back the next evening and wish that we had. Instead, we ended up eating at Palio, the touted resort restaurant where they expect you to dress a little nicer, which was decent but expensive. I had the sea scallops which for the most part was good - 2 out of 4 scallops were cooked perfectly, 1 was a little under cooked but edible and the 4th just tasted bad - very fishy, in a foul way. My friend had the halibut which was ok. I tried it and it was a little dry and not in any way as good as the mahi-mahi from Pasta y Pueblo which was less than half the price! There is a little bakery (Isomar's - last left coming down from the resort before you hit Rte 3) which has fabulous sandwiches and breakfast foods. An omelet at the resort will cost you $15, but an omelet at Isomar's is only $3.75! We found a Walgreens (just a few minutes further down Rte 3) where we bought 30 bottles of water for $5 (vs $2.50/bottle at the resort) and several more tubes of sunscreen at a \"normal\" price (vs $16-$20 at the resort). And yes, we finished all 30 bottles of water - the Puerto Rican sun is HOT! While you're outside the resort, visit the supermarket (next to the Walgreens) and buy your own smores ingredients (they also sell you the stuff if you don't have a rental car). There is a fire pit near the Tiki bar where you can roast your marshmallows! Yum! 2) Register for the Wyndham Rewards Membership - it's free! You can get free internet access from your room. You'll still have to click on the $14.99/24hr rate but they'll take it off your bill at the end of your stay as long as the person whose name the room is under has the Wyndham Rewards Membership. 3) Bring some bug repellent. Not necessary for the day time, but helpful if you're out and about at night or if you go visit the rain forest. I still got bit twice even with the bug repellent... 4) Make coffee in your room for free. Don't drink the coffee at the table if you go to Marabella for breakfast - it's deceiving because they put a carafe of coffee on your table and you think it's complimentary.

The grounds are stunning-- among the most beautiful I've seen after visiting numerous resorts throughout the Caribbean and Hawaii. The rooms are so-so: don't expect anything special there. We had a partial ocean view. The balcony and view were nice. The walls in the room are quite thin, so that was a disappointment, but I sleep with earplugs regularly, so I have no idea whether it was loud enough to disrupt sleep-- my husband and 2 year old slept fine. Having done a lot of research ahead of time, it seemed renting a car solved for most of the 'complaints' about this property. I was right. The resort location is remote, but it is not desolate. About a mile away, are countless retailers, restaurants, etc along the bustling 'main' drag (PR-3). The hotel concierge includes only 4 or so restaurants on its list of recommendations outside the hotel grounds, but you'll have many more options than that within a short drive. We ate at Isamar Bakery (phone: [--]) for breakfast (coming from the Wyndham, take the last left into the parking area before PR-3)-- it was GREAT--nothing fancy, but very inexpensive and delicious. We also regularly patronized McDonald's for breakfast-- prices were consistent with those in the continental US. We ate at Ceviche Hut (Peruvian food; head East on PR-3) and their paella and chicken kabobs were very good. Bottom line-- if you stay outside San Juan, expect a true 'resort' experience-- i.e., without a car, you'll be trapped . Car rentals are inexpensive: check Expedia, Hotwire, etc. Our midsize was $28/day. There is an Avis onsite at the Wyndham, but I would assume their prices are inflated. With a car rental, you'll get a better feel for PR, some freedom, and the ability to offset some of the hefty onsite inflated prices. And yes, the parking is pricey. $20 if you valet (no need to do that, parking lot is under the main building); $15 if you self-park. Parking gets a little tight late at night with the casino crowds, but there is an overflow lot across the street (I think)....should not be a problem. Bottom line: great resort to enjoy some R&R, but if you are on a budget and/or want to see more of PR, rent a car. I heard that going to El Yunque Rainforest, which is right across the main drag from the resort is offered by the resort at a price of $60!!! Pretty incredible considering its proximity to the resort and the fact that there is no entrance fee charged to visit El Yunque. Your rental car will pay for itself. By the way, the iguanas don't bite-- you will see a few near the pool, try not to get freaked out. They won't run from you, but they won't approach you either.

I felt welcomed everywhere I went in the hotel. I commend these people on their command of the English language and their ability to communicate efficiently and fluently with their guests. Room: We did get bumped up to an Ocean Front Suite and the room was very clean and the view was beautiful. Are the rooms a little dated? Yes, but they are kept in great shape. Grounds: The hotel grounds were absolutely gorgeous and well kept. Beach: I have to say that when the clouds are around (which they were almost the entire time) the beach/ocean looked just like the jersey shore . However, when the sun did peek out it looked spectacular. Palio's Restaurant: Italian restaurant at the resort which was very romantic and delicious. Only restaurant we ate in at the resort. THE BAD: The cost of EVERYTHING. As mentioned earlier, I am used to paying a lot to go out to eat; but the prices here are truly disgusting. $11.50 for a frozen drink, $3.50 for one cup of coffee. $15 per day for internet in your room!! This is the 21st century and WIFI should be commonplace today. They only had 3 working computers in the lobby. TIPS ON HOW TO SAVE Make coffee in your room. They do not charge you for it. Go downstairs to gift shop and buy Parmalet milk (which does not have to be refrigerated). BYOB!! Without a doubt. If you don't have a car; pay the $15 R/T and go to liquor store and stock up. Get a cheap disposable cooler to keep things on ice in your room. Eat Dinner Out - even if you don't have a car it is still less expensive to pay for cab/meal than it is to eat at resort. May I recommend the following: LaParilla in Yocullo which is a $30 R/T cab ride and Hacienda which is a $20 cab ride. Both were spectacular food/service/price. Ritchies on the hill was nice but just a pricey as hotel. BYOS - Bring your own snacks! Packed lots of granola bars, Cheez It's, dried fruits, etc. and snacked on those during day. Did not need to eat lunch which can run you $50 for two people. Rent a Kayak and do the river. A tandem kayak was only $35 for an hour and we took it up the river towards the Rain Forest. What a breathtaking little tour. Do Not Book Tours through hotel as they charge so much $$. Go online and find a reputable tour - some even offer R/T transportation from the hotel. I would definitely go back and maybe even rent a car. It was unfortunate that we had such bad weather. It has been pretty rotten weather down there for quite some time. However, don't forget the sunscreen because even though it's hazy you will get burned. Puerto Rico is a beautiful island filled with beautiful people. If you are on the fence just book it knowing that it's going to be expensive; I don't think you will be disappointed. A word to Wyndham: You have a jewel here in the Caribbean. The only negative is the nickel and diming that you do to the guests. We met people from all over the US and the common theme by everyone was the price of food/drink. It did force me to leave resort to eat elsewhere. Also, a steel drum band poolside/beach music is needed. An authentic PR restaurant at resort would also be a good idea.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, NC", "Title": "\u201cMisleading Room Categories/The Run-Around/Fees for Everything Spoil Stay\u201d", "Author": "Tarheels0607", "ReviewID": "UR58341763", "Content": "My wife and I were excited to get away for a mini-vacation before I have to hunker down for law school final exams and bar exam preparation. We booked with the Wyndham Rio Mar on Expedia because it seemed like a great deal. We decided to splurge and paid extra for an Oceanfront room with 1 King Bed. When we arrived check-in seemed to go okay, although the wait was a little on the long side, but then we went to our room. We had booked the most expensive non-suite oceanfront category w/ a King bed and yet you could not see the ocean from our room and it had two queen beds. The room should be categorized as a pool/garden view, because that's all you can see from it. The room was also located on the lobby level which has VERY loud music most nights that plays well past a reasonable hour. We went to the front desk to change rooms. We were informed that they did not have any oceanfront rooms available that had a king-sized bed in them so we were moved to the mountain side of the resort. Our \"rainforest view\" in the new room consisted mostly of the conference center's roof and air conditioning system. At least they refunded us the difference in rates. Also, even though the floor has a sign saying that it is a non-smoking floor, the second room absolutely smelled like people have been smoking in there for years. We had to go to Walgreens to get an air freshener just to be able to stand it. The resort also charges an arm and a leg for everything. They charge a substantial parking fee, and if you really want to see a decent amount of the island you have to rent a car (the hotel is a $75 cab ride each way from the airport). Our first night we at the sandwich shop near the casino to get something fast and we had hoped cheap. However, basic wraps were $8 each and drinks (bottled water and Gatorade) were $4-$4.50. We ordered room service for breakfast the following morning. To save money we split a single breakfast and this was the way to go. The Continental Breakfast was $17 and consisted of two croissants, two muffins, some fruit, orange juice, coffee, and (for some reason or other warm) milk. It could definitely feed two, but given what it was not really worth $17 plus 18% service charge + $3.50 delivery charge (almost $25). The only other time we ate on the property was at Marbella, which is a buffet. The food was decent, but I expect better for $26 a person. I know it seems like I'm piling on at this point, but the parking situation was not spectacular either. The fact that the parking was covered was much appreciated since it rained almost every day of our trip, but it is poorly lit, often difficult to find a space and the method of getting in and out is annoying. Rather than giving guests some form of a parking pass to get in and out of the garage you have to take a ticket when you enter, go to the valet stand to validate your ticket whenever you want to leave (which is at the main entrance of the resort, not near the parking area). If the valet stand were on our way to the garage it wouldn't be too bad, but this unfortunately was not the case. The resort gift shop was decent. It has a pretty good selection of items, but definitely check around before buying anything because prices can be steep compared to other places on some items (though others are reasonable and in-line with other places). For example, Bacardi rum is $26 at the resort for a 1L bottle. Pretty much anywhere else on the island that one liter goes for $10-12. Do yourself a favor and get all of your rum right from the source, the Bacardi distillery, which is open for tours, which is a neat thing to do on a rainy day. Another positive for the resort is that on weekends they have tables set up with local artisans selling their wares. Most of them have pretty good deals for unique handicraft gifts/souvenirs. Another place in the area to go for souvenirs is Coqui International which is nearby on the way to the rainforest (a must see). Which gets to the best aspect of the resort, its location. It is probably the closest resort to the entrance to the rainforest. This means it's about an hour from the sites of Old San Juan and you have to deal with substantial traffic to see those, but the area around El Yunque is very pretty. Overall, the resort has some good promise but fails in the execution of it.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cRio Mar: A Bummer on The Beach\u201d", "Author": "vacationjubilation", "ReviewID": "UR58264614", "Content": "OK, folks: the straight skinny on Rio Mar. And know that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m posting this because my husband and I feel obligated to give unsuspecting guests the heads up. We booked 4 nights at the Rio Mar--arriving Thursday night, and leaving Monday morning--for a little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153babymoon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before our second child arrives this summer. We love going on little getaways, and typically choose upscale hotels or resorts that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotten a bargain on. We work hard, and like to enjoy a vacation treat once in a while, but still try to keep within a budget like most people. First a few bright spots: the grounds facing the beach were beautiful, the pools were nicely laid out, and we were upgraded to an ocean front suite, which was spacious and clean. But outside of these details, there were some glaring disappointments\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This place was rated a 4 to 4.5 star-property by many of the travel websites, and although we eventually booked it for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Hotels.com, we did consult a Liberty travel agent that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve used several times for advice, and were told that it was one of the properties they send many guests to. We were, therefore, surprised from the outset of the physical condition of the Rio Mar was in: the exterior was in desperate need of a paint job and interior d\u00c3\u00a9cor was drab, overly dark and outdated; the handrails on the stairwells of the main lobby were visibly dirty and signs of untended wear were all around. So right off the bat, it was clear that this place provided far from the luxe feel that we were led to believe we should expect. And yet, despite the malt-beverage-atmosphere, this place charged Dom Perignon prices for everything from a cup of yogurt, to parking, to transport shuttles. Rio Mar literally up-charges its guests extraordinary prices for every basic essential one can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pack in a suitcase. Let me put it in perspective: we had dinner Thursday night, and meals Friday, Saturday and Sunday on the property; Keeping in mind that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy a cocktail because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pregnant, and my husband doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink, we did not order booze; And once it became clear--by about 10AM on Friday morning--that options on Rio Mar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menus were going to cost us as much as black-market major organs, we refrained from deserts, appetizers and the more premium entr\u00c3\u00a9e options (p.s. not the way we like to vacation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6watching every dime). So this meant NOTHING fancy: pasta dishes or burgers at dinner, simple (and tiny) sandwich wraps for lunch\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you get the picture\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and even with this budget conserving strategy, our food bill came to over $700 for three days of meals!!! Let me repeat that: over $700 for three days of no-frills, alcohol-free, tiny-portioned meals\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6for two people!! It was gross. Getting a fridge and picking up some items at the grocery store would have netted us a per-night service charge. Renting a car and using it to travel each day--\u00e2\u20ac\u0153off-campus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as my husband joked--not only would have cost us the rental fee, but a $20 per night parking charge for the car (even though there is an AVIS fleet, with it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own parking spaces on the premises). Everywhere we turned there was a Rio Mar charge, and for every possible work-around solution, a Rio Mar counter-charge. It was like a game of chess that was rigged before the match started. So the bottom line is, if you want to visit Puerto Rico, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worth the hassle, not worth the money and nobody should have to work this hard to outsmart their resort on vacation!! ...And it's tough to relax when your pockets are being picked.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel and Resort but with Issues\u201d", "Author": "Bronzegirl6", "ReviewID": "UR58089964", "Content": "My husband and I stayed @ Rio Mar Beach resort for a week long getaway.

The moment I entered the hotel I felt relaxed, it was beautiful. We opted for the room with the double bed on the higher floor, since it was still morning when we checked in we didn't have much to choose from. When we got to the room it was ok, the mountain view was breathtaking. The sheets and a pillowcase had stains on them. The bathroom was a disappoint, the bathtub/shower wall had significant amount of black mildew on it. And, when I sat down by the desk what did I see?.. a roach! That's right, a roach! It was a little one, I freaked out and told my husband. I managed to kill it immediately, last thing I wanted was to have one crawl into our luggages. My first thought was to call the front desk, but my husband thought I was making a big deal so I didn't call. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt hoping that this was just a single roach that lost its way. Later on we went down to the pool, it was very nice and well kept. We saw iguanas everywhere, people were feeding them all sorts of foods. That night we ate at Palio's Restaurant, the food was very good, the price tag was as to be expected, over $100 bucks with no drinks just water. The next day we went to the market Amigos the cab ride was $15 each way. We got some water, milk, beer, and snacks. On our way back we asked the cab driver to take us to his favorite spot to eat, he took us to Don Pepe. The menu sounded better than how the food actually tasted... it was too salty. I wouldn't recommend it. Later that evening around 10 pm, after we requested our refrigerator and put the groceries away what did I see, it was another roach this time this one was a little bigger in size. I was livid, I got on the phone and explained to the operator what happened and he said he would send up an engineer to fumigate the room!! And that I would have to leave the room for about an hour! I said, \"Uh, NO, I have a 3 month old and a 2 year there is no way I am exposing them to the fumes, I would like a room change. I did an intense search to find a suitable place for my family to stay in Puerto Rico and no where did I come across any complaints about roaches in this facility. I am very disappointed and I don't want to stay in this room any longer\". He patched me through another operator and after explaining him the situation my request was granted in a heartbeat. The bellman was at our door in 15 minutes, and I was ready to move with 2 sleeping babies I might add. The next room was on another floor in a completely different wing. I was very pleased with our new room, it was bigger and much more airy than the other room. It was also an ocean front view room with a balcony that extended outward. The only complaint my husband had the next day and every day afterwards was the fact that the walls were very thin. You can hear foot steps and talking on the top and side walls. It didn't bother me, as long as I didn't see any roaches I didn't care. The bathroom walls were in better condition too. Overall the hotel is very nice pricey but nice. The staff was very nice and accommodating, they treated my family very well, they made me feel welcomed. The beach was also very nice, it could be better...cleaner.

Beach views, mountain views, the grounds are beautifully landscaped and it is very clean! My room was sizable with 2 queen beds, and I loved having a balcony facing the beach and listening to the ocean waves. The adult pool is a nice to have as the other pool is filled with kids, but if you don't claim a spot there before 8:30 AM you are out of luck. Its a smaller area and it fills up quickly. I actually spent more time on the beach - they provide towels, lounge chairs and umbrellas at no cost if you want one. The beach front is spacious and its easy to find a quiet spot under a palm tree. I loved it. As a solo female traveler, I felt very safe here and found everyone to be very nice - from the bellman, to the waiters and waitresses...and not to mention some very cute male bartenders at the Tiki area (yes I had to toss that in there for the ladies) The lobby lounge is a great spot to mingle with other travelers and have a drink and/or lite bite. If you want a more quiet setting check out Boleros on the 1st floor east wing, they have big comfy chairs, a pianist and a nice selection of appetizers. The calamari here is the best and at $10 you can't go wrong. If you are a runner the resort has 2 jogger paths - one right along the beach, the other with beautiful view of the mountains/ rain forest. This was a favorite of mine. Even if you don't run, its worth the walk. The have a tour service on site and offer a multitude of 1/2 day and full day trips at a reasonable price. I really enjoyed the history and little known facts our tour guides shared...something you wouldn't get if you rented a car and went out on your own. Our tour guide even stopped at a local restaurant so we could enjoy an authentic Hispanic meal, which you cannot get at the hotel, which brings me to the negatives The Negatives: Lack of authentic Hispanic foods on site. One would think since we're in Puerto Rico they would offer a variety of Hispanic meals - but this isn't the case. In fact, the food is over priced and in many cases, not all that good. I ate many of my meals on site and was only happy with three of them - Burger at the lobby bar, lunch at Marbella's and the calamari at Boleros. Also, from day one I had problems with the lock on my door and my key cards wouldn't always work - each day I reported this to the front desk and each day they told me they would send someone to check the battery in the door lock , but this never happened. And on day 3 of me complaining to the front desk - a lady finally told me that until they can replace the battery to turn the handle UP after passing my card through... not down and I can gain access to my room. Worked like a charm, but wish they told me this earlier as it was frustrating to constantly be locked out of my room. Regarding the Tiki and Seabreeze (our door restaurants) - GREAT ATMOSPHERE...but I was a bit disappointed they either stopped serving food by 4 or 5PM and/or closed down by 6/7PM most nights - it would have been nice to eat dinner outside by the beach. Couple that with the fact the 3 main restaurants always requiring reservations for dinner so you don't have many options left if you like to just go with the flow and not plan ahead. Either Lobby lounge with limited menu or Marbellas - which probably has the best food in my opinion, but can be boring to dine at every morning, noon and night. I'm a gym rat and have to say for such a large and beautiful resort the fitness facility was shameful. Small, stuffy with old worn out equipment. Maybe I'm spoiled, since my home gym is a country club setting - but I honestly expected more since the rest of the resort is quite lavish. But since most people don't go on vacation to workout I can see why they don't bother putting any money into improving this area. Also, my bed wasn't that comfortable - no pillow top mattresses and the bed was a bit firm for me - so I tossed and turned the first few nights Not a negative - but it would also have been nice if they had more of a nightlife..all they offered was karaoke from 6-10Pm at the Shimas restaurant. Overall I had a great experience here for my money - that's key. I got a great deal through the company I booked with ($1200 for flight, round trip transfer and 6 nights) and I believe that is what it comes down to ... experience/quality + cost = value and I felt I got my money's worth.

I like the two pool setup... one for families with children and another just for adults. I also liked that childcare was available throughout the entire day and evening up to midnight. My favorite thing was that the outdoor pools and hot tubes were open late at night... very romantic and relaxing. The restaurants within the resort were all very high-class and beautifully designed. The food was very good, with some regional variations. I'd read some reviews prior to going that said the food was poor, but that was not my experience at all. I though the food was excellent. Now granted, a few dishes were made differently then how they are made in the North-Eastern US, but that's to be expected (and appreciated) when you're visiting a totally different region of the world. For example, my wife didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the coffee (she thought it was extremely weak) but she learned that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the locals liked it. You have to specifically ask for Coffee Americano to get the same type of Coffee you would expect in the US. I've read some reviews that said the food, drinks, and amenities were pricy, but I didn't think so. The prices are pretty much the same as you would expect to pay at a resort of this caliber in the US and Hawaii. This is to be expected since Puerto Rico is a US territory. Average food prices were ~25 dollars per meal per person, drinks ~9 dollars, and childcare/kids-club ~11 dollars per hour. I thought this was very reasonable for what is essentially a US-based resort (of this caliber). If you're on a tight vacation budget though, this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the resort for you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 neither would any other resort in Puerto Rico for that matter.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful beach and pool, big resort personal touch is lacking\u201d", "Author": "pinetamare", "ReviewID": "UR57212763", "Content": "I traveled during New England school vacation week with my husband and two sons ages 15 and 11. I have traveled throughout Asia, Europe and the Carribean so I have seen a lot of properties. My objective was to rest a bit but also to keep everyone in the family happy by participating in all of the adventure that is available. We stayed for 5 nights. Arrival: We arrived around 4:30PM, luggage came within 20 minutes and we were on the car rental shuttle. We rented a car with GPS which was VERY helpful as we did a lot of exploring during our stay. The drive to the hotel was about 40 minutes, we went the \"alternative\" route which apparently helps you avoid downtown San Juan traffic. The drive was just fine. Once we arrived at the hotel we used the valet service and went to check in. We never self parked the entire time. The room we arrived in overlooked the garage and ramp. We had payed for an ocean view room. If someone swung me to the left of the balcony by my ankles I could see the ocean. It was the EXACT picture someone had posted on this site that I prayed we would not get. Anyway, enough said. I went to the front desk the next morning and asked to be moved. After a bit of hemming and hawing (they claimed they were overbooked by two rooms) they agreed to move us to another room which was just as we had paid for, ocean view. By the way, I did become a Wyndham resort member as some had suggested on this site, It made no impact during my stay. If you book through Expedia or any other outlet they do not care if you are a Wyndham member when you check in. The room was large,clean, and very comfortable for 4 people. We never ate at the resort. We picked up breakfast at Isomar which is a little bakery at the entrance of the hotel. (On the right as you enter the road to the hotel). The breakfast sandwiches and pastries were great. We went to Walmart in Fajardo, picked up a styrofoam cooler, beer, sodas and snacks. This was a huge cost savings. I do not advocate shopping at Walmart while on vacation but let's face it, most of us are trying to work within a budget. After purchasing 4 pina coladas for $34.00 (2 virgin, 2 alcohol) I was done with buying drinks at the hotel. I picked up a bottle of wine for $15.00 at the little grocery on the left side of the street as you enter the hotel road. Activities: The concierge was wonderful with suggestions. We booked everything ourselves though. We went ATV'ing, hiked to Mina falls and the very top of the rainforest, spent an afternoon in Old San Juan, went horseback riding, and did the Bio Bay kayak tour. By the way, the toured the rain forest on our own as many have suggested. The kayak tour is great, we used the ECO tour group and I booked it before we left the U.S. The ocean part is a little choppy and overall it is a little daunting going through the narrow channel. We boat in Maine all summer (canoe,sail and motorboat) so we are used to boats. My 11 year old was a bit nervous when we started out but came around once we got out to the lagoon and saw the glowing plankton. The tour guide gave excellent science info which was really cool. The ocean was really warm and the waves were large. I did not let my son go out far since I could feel the undertow. We had a great time taking in the waves. My 15 year old noticed that some of the kids were making s'mores at a fire pit one late afternoon. He went to get one for his younger brother and the man that was handing out the sticks/marshmallows asked him for $5.00. There are absolutely NO give aways, or deals at this hotel. Not a problem for me because I expected that but I think it is shocking if you are used to all-inclusives. My husband brought his laptop there is no free WIFI in the room. There is a bank of about 6 computers in the lobby you can use but we never did. Bottom line, the pool and slide for the kids is great. The iguanas are cool, the beach is beautiful. If you can venture out and eat outside the resort you will enjoy it. The room is comfortable. Overall I think Puerto Rico is just great.

The meal was very good. Our server Lisa was friendly and excellent. Overall we found the staff to be very courteous. We also ate at the Country Club Grill and that was not a good meal. The sushi place was good and prices were reasonable. We ate a \"quick lunch\" by the pool one day and had a chicken kebob that was under cooked and awful. We got smart and went to ERL for lunch the next day (great sandwiches). Also, you can buy beer and small bottles of liquor there so we did so and had happy hour in our room. Cheaper then $10 drinks at the bar! Also grabbed breakfast from ERL so we could avoid the chaos at the family restaurant. Overall, it was a good relaxing trip, which is exactly what we wanted.

The pools were very nice, very big, very clean. The bigger pool has a water slide and kids were really having fun. The smaller pool is adults only, and very relaxing, quieter, and surrounded by palm trees. Both pools had hot tubs attached. There is a nice big gas open air fireplace between the pools and the beach where adults gathered and socialized at night. The food was hit and miss. The food quality averaged 2 out of 5, but cost was 4/5. The sushi place was decent. I got a Cuban pork sandwich for $15 that was not nearly as good as I can get in Cleveland for $8.

A few years ago we rented a 1 bedroom ocean villa, this time didn't want to pay the price for a 2 bedroom, so went for a golf villa. To say the villa was wonderful is an understatement. Villa Luz is a 2 bedroom, 2.5 bath golf villa in Rio Mar Village section. The villa was beautiful, roomy, clean and came with a golf cart. There was a very nice balcony off the livingroom and a small balcony off the master bedroom. The master bath was amazing and far larger than ours at home. Everything was in good working order and it's obvious the owner takes much pride in her unit. I also need to note that my son woke up with an ear problem one morning and the concierge at resortvilla rentals was wonderful. We had a name of a dr within 5 minutes and phone #. My son chose not to go, and his problem did get better (thanks to trip advisor members that helped with this, also) This was a relaxing vacation for us,so we just hung out at the Rio Mar beach everyday. Each night we went out for dinner, since we had a rental car from Charlie's. Restaurants : BRASS CACTUS - pretty much the same as a few years ago, good food , plus they make great drinks. Ordered ribs based on prior trip advisor reviews and they didn't dissapoint. LA ESTACION - absolutely delic and enjoyed feeding one of the cats (so cute). Husband and son had skirt steak and I had grilled snapper. LOLITTAS - everyone enjoyed their meal, their nachos with beef and cheese were so good. EL JEFE BURGER - I will start by saying it was not crowded when we got there (filled up as we were waiting for our meal). We just ordered burgers and it took well over an hour (close to 1.5 hours) to receive our meal. Yes the white sangria was good, but it was gone well before our meal arrived. The burgers and fies were good, but I was so hungry at that point anything would have been tasty. I could see waiting this long if El Jefe was crowded when we arrived, but it wasn't. I honestly don't know what the problem was. LA PARILLA - We visited 2 times. The first time I liked the food better, but it took 2 hours to get our meal. But I must admit, it was worth it. We visited our last night in PR, hardly waited, but I thought the food was better on our prior visit (my son ordered the same thing both times). Still I wouldn't hesitate to return.

My husband and I stayed 4 nights in Feb 2010. Day 1: Arrived late so concierge recommended going to Restaurant Hacienda. Shuttle from restaurant picks you up directly from hotel - nice for the 1st night if arriving in the dark so you don't have to think about directions. Great fish and Mofongo (ask for it moist). Spent about 80 including drinks. 2. Day 2: Breakfast at Ishmaels (Bakery before you hit Highway 3). Great breakfast sandwiches (~$3) and Amazing Guava/cheese pastries and The best pastrami sandwich (get it with all the fixings) - ~$5. Hikeed the rainforest - only a couple miles from the hotel. We hiked Mina Falls and then drove all the way to the top and hiked to the look point point - definitely worth the hike - all up hill but worth it for the view. A MUST. Bio Bay Tour thru East Wind Adventures. if you're interested in doing the bio bay thru this company (i think it's the only 1 that allows you to swim in water - best to experience it) make sure you call a couple days in advance - weekends are usually booked. Drinks and Dinner included in tour - ~110. 3 - Day 3: Antojitos Breakfast - again next door to Ishmaels Bakery - more of a sit down but still cheap - only $5-6 for greasy omelets - good after a night of mojitos. Sat around pool - get there early if you want a chair under umbrella. Adult and kid pool separate. we were there when 2 big corporate groups were there so the hotel was crazy. not sure if it's like that all the time but for the rate we got for a mountain view room we didn't care. we didn't eat at the hotel restaurants though because of that reason - it was very loud every night because of big groups. the beach off the resort is also very nice and the water temp is perfect. waves were crazy big though - sometimes we weren't allowed in the water. 4 - Day 4: Hiked again! rain forest is free if you just want to hike (closed at 6pm). we did do the info center/video ($4/person) but you don't need to. definitely don't bother with tours - wouldn't want to wait for everyone to take pictures at every stop. nice to hike at your own leisure - that's why you need to rent a car. also loved wydham because you were so close to the rainforest. grabbed breakfast sandwiches at Palmer bakery (on way to rainforest) - not as good as ishmaels and they were rude. but you can share one of their sandwiches they are big. rainforest has a couple restaurants on your way to different hikes as well - so don't feel like you need to bring anything. that night we did the kiosks (west on highway 3) - El Jefe Burger Shack - best mojitos i've EVER had and really good sangria. burger and atmosphere were great - $10 for burger and fries. all restaurants are open air. the owner is from the states (Even shared his mojito recipe) so he knows a good burger and waitstaff were awesome. Tried Ceviche Hut as well - not so good. didn't seem fresh to me and really expensive - almost $20! Only stayed 4 nights at Rio Mar and then moved to Condado (Miamish). I think that was enough because the resort was so secluded - i didn't like that you couldn't walk anywhere to grab a drink or food away from the hotel - so definitely need a car. $20/day for valet though - but you do have in/out privileges (but get's to be $25 after tipping). Tips: Must rent car (pays for itself so you're not paying for the \"day-trips\") Grab breakfast at Ishmael's Bring bug spray (I've never had so many bites - definitely ruined some of the trip) Drive to top of Rainforest and Hike the Trail to the Britton Lookout Tower Have Mojitos at El Jefe!!!!", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connectiucut", "Title": "\u201cwould go back in a heartbeat\u201d", "Author": "dancerone", "ReviewID": "UR56537330", "Content": "we just got home today, spent 6 nights at Rio Mar - trip was primarily in honor of my approaching 60th birthday -resort had been recommended by a coworker who had gone last year during the Feb. school vacation week - I am a beach lover, my husband somewhat less so, but he is the one who voiced the sentiment I used to title this review - we ate at every restaurant except the Asian one (not his cup of tea) and were very happy with everything - had dinner on Valentine's Day at Palio and loved the extra touch of the rose and champagne - went to San Juan one night to go to Il Mulino at the Ritz and it was excellent - did not want to bother to rent a car so used a taxi, worth it for us - it has been over ten years since we traveled to a warm place during the winter and my expectations and hopes were really high and I was not looking much at the cost of things - have to say we were totally delighted - some things I liked: resort is beautiful but not stuffy or pretentious; some people dress up just a bit at night and that gave me a chance to wear some of my nice summer dresses; long long beach to walk on which I did every morning between 7 and 8; lovely spa (had a great seaweed wrap treatment) - of course what was especially nice (and basically good luck) was that the weather was absolutely gorgeous (only one overcast morning) and my husband won $1800 on a slot machine in the casino on our last night!

When I was booking this trip I was torn between the Rio Mar and the El Conquistador. Based on price, we decided to give the RIo Mar a try. First off, the entire family had a great time. I guess I need to temper our experience with the actual quality of the resort. If I could, I would probably give the resort 3.5 stars, not 4. My experience reflects most of the feedback from prior posts. Some of the pros include an excellent pool complex for little ones, stones throw from the beach, and several food and activities options. We spent a week split between hanging at the pool and relaxing on the beach. As noted in prior posts, the beach was nice but watch the undertoe, it can easily knock small children over. Most days we were there, the surf was pretty intense which was actually a lot of fun if you keep a close eye on the kids. There was the typical third party company running the motor sports on the beach and we paid the $100 for a dual jetski for a half hour. It was fun. There were poolside cabanas available for $150/per day. A bit excessive considering you get a glorified umbrella with some fruit and water. The chair situation at the pool and beach was challenging if you get a late start but manageable. We were there for February school vacation so the resort was at capacity. If you enjoy playing the game where you throw a hat or flip flops on chairs first thing in the morning, then you can guarantee a choice spot at the pool. If you get a late start you might have to throw one of the beach attendants a few bucks to scrounge up some seating. I was used to this since I normally travel during school vacations when resorts are at capacity. Despite this, the resort didn't seem over crowded. The resort grounds are very nice and expansive if you need to get away from the crowds. The main pool complex was very large and had a small water slide, decent for small children. And yes, there are the iguanas. For most of the week they were everywhere. Some of the kids would chase them all over the pool complex while other children were extremely apprehensive around them. To be honest, you sort of get used to their presence after the first day. I could personally take or leave them but one did crawl up on my 4 year old while my back was turned to grab a bite of her hot dog bun. That was interesting. The pool bar and grill was well staffed and was a great spot to hang out or sit and have a drink on the water. The rooms were nice enough with the usual amenities and flat screen tvs. Yes, the air conditioning was a bit loud but that didn't bother anyone. I did agree with some of the prior posts that the interior spaces were a little worn and dated but the rooms were decent. The service was a bit inconsistent but was good overall. We requested towels on a couple of occasions and the first time they arrived within 10 minutes and the second time took hours. Room service was about the same. Sometimes it was prompt and the order was correct and other times it was a long wait and the order was incorrect. The staff was usually very helpful and courteous if not overly friendly. I think having a car is the way to go. The excursions through the tour desk seemed a bit pricey for what you get and you can easily take yourself far cheaper. We drove to Old San Juan and took a ride thru the rainforest. I would recommend both if you have a car. Not sure I would do either with 3 young children if I had to pay for a tour. The forts at Old San Juan were cool, and there was lots of quaint shops and restaurants. The rainforest was definitely worth the drive thru but we didn't do any of the trail hikes. I wanted to take my nephew on a zip line but they were booked up. The food as mentioned extensively in other posts is pricey but I was prepared for that. I didn't find the prices much worse then other caribbean resorts. The food at the \"upscale\" dining was good, though not gourmet. The casual restaurant was just ok. The things you really feel like you are getting nickel and dimed on are things like parking (20$/day for valet) and wireless (15/per day), and refrigerators ($10/day). The location of the resort was ideal. Just far enough outside of San Juan to feel like you were at a secluded resort without being far from the airport. !0 minutes from the rain forest and a short drive to the ferry in Fajardo made it a can't beat location. The casino was really small but was never crowded and had slots and most of the table games were covered. If you are looking for an Atlantis style casino ambience, this certainly isn't the place but it was there if gambling is your thing. Overall, the family had a blast and the resort was nice despite a few short comings. We had a 4.5 star experience at a 3.5 star resort. I booked the trip pretty late, and comparable resorts during this week were nearly double for an ocean front room. I paid around $200/night during school vacation week and would definitely recommend this resort if you get a similar deal.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201crelaxing vacation\u201d", "Author": "DorothyT3", "ReviewID": "UR56457495", "Content": "This is a great resort if you only want relaxation and golf.

We experienced an error by a dealer in the casino and his performance to rectify the situation was awful. He paid out the wrong number at roulette and then made the patrons feel bad for his mistake. One couple who complained about being shorted was paid off and then told they could not return again that evening. The dealer made the mistake, not the patrons. Overall, we had a great vacation! We loved the property, however felt that the food and drinks were VERY expensive. The room was fine, but not necessarily typical Wyndham quality. We enjoyed ourselves, but others should be warned how pricey it is.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cExcellent resort; fantastic beach, water, amenities, pools. food, and service.\u201d", "Author": "JustinTodd", "ReviewID": "UR56291487", "Content": "I would highly recommend this resort. Better beaches, water, food and service than Mexico, and without the constant, annoying vendors on the beach. Even though the property was completely sold out while we were there, they were still offering a Vacation Stimulus Package; essentially four nights accomodation for the price of two, plus we were upgraded to ocean front with balcony and king bed rooms, plus a $100 food and beverage credit, and a free cabana day rental. The cabana's are highly recommended, and include great service, a cooler filled with water and soft drinks, and some munchies. The food served from the resort pool bar is outstanding. Highly recommend the mahi mahi sandwich, or the burgers. They are 5 star quality. Even if we had had to pay the cabana daily rate of $150, it would be worth every penny. A cabana is a great way to treat yourself to luxury. There are many reviews herein that complain about the price of the food in the resort restaurants, but few of those reviews talk about the quality that you get. We are very picky, and real foodies, and can tell you that the food is outstanding, and worth every penny; especially the asian fusion restaurant. The breakfast buffet is outstanding. Prices for dinner are $25-$35 per entre', which some reviews dis, but IT IS A RESORT, not just some shleppie hotel, and the same meals would cost the same prices anywere in the US. Many reviews rave about a \"food kiosk\" that is about two miles away (taxi $8), and those quaint, local food type restaurants are fantastic, and well worth going to, but the pricing is the same as the hotel for entre's. You get what you pay for. The only disappointment for us was the food at a restaurant near the entrance of the resort, Richie's, which is recommended by the resort, and even offers a shuttle to it. I have been travelling extensively for 30 years, have probably eaten more than 1,000 restaurant dinners, and this was one of the worst ever. Terrible american type food, poor service, well over priced; a huge disappointment. Stay away if you are a foodie. Only one other minor complaint; some of the reviews talk about having an adjoining room, and that is was noisy. That's true. adjoining room doors are a bit thin, and have a wide space at the bottom. Request that you are not put in one of these rooms.

If you want a nice resort on a great long stretch of beach, this is your resort. How we got there: We weren't renting a car since we were staying for just three nights, and wanted beach beach beach, so we used Julien's Transportation (cell [--] office [--] ) For a party of five, it was $80 one way (without tip) and he stopped at the Wal Mart on the way for us for about 15 minutes while we stocked up on waters, juices, snacks. Highly recommend Julian. The check-in staff was very helpful, and gave us rooms near each other, and upgraded us to ocean view since I had joined the Wyndham Member program. I had told them we were there for my mother's 65th birthday, and they sent a tray with red wine and fruits to her room. There is inconsistent beach service. One day, a girl came around to take our orders, another, no beach service. The young men who put out the umbrellas were helpful in getting us a cushion for my 78 year old aunt, because the beach chairs are VERY uncomfortable. I wanted a resort on a long stretch of beach, and this is perfect for that. You can walk miles. The beach staff needs to 'get on line' and pick up the garbage on the beach in front of the resort though. No excuse for wrappers and cups being there every day. They rake the sand, but don't pick up the litter. The water was pretty and a perfect temperature, no big breaking waves when we were there but definitely a pretty strong undertow one day, and my sister and I, both former lifeguards, where getting ready to head in to help one mother whose son was having trouble with the undertow. The other days, especially in the morning, it looked calm enough for little kids. There was a neat little sandbar out about 1/2 mile that strong swimmers could swim to. Restaurants were just ok-if you are a foodie, probably not going to be overwhelmed. Spa: my mother had a wonderful balinese body polish and massage. This is a nice, unpretentious, somewhat dated resort on a great beach, and if your expectations are set correctly, you can have a wonderful time.", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "ljmac22", "ReviewID": "UR55782834", "Content": "My husband and I checking into the Rio Mar on Thursday, February 4th. Check in was fast and our bags arrived in our room shortly thereafter. First of all, let me talk about the beauty of the resort. When we turned into the resort grounds I was so happy. There was a beautiful lush golf course. In the distance you can see the azure waters of the ocean and lovely beach. To your right there are the mountains of the El Yunque rainforest. The grounds are so beautiful, lush and tropical. The inside the hotel didn't disappoint either. Upscale without being overly opulent. The colors and motif make you feel relaxed immediately. We lucked out with the location of our room. If you are booking a trip and you want to have the easiest access to the adult pool/ocean and breakfast buffett then ask for rooms numbered from around 1030 down to 1000. We were right in the center of this hallway and the location was perfect. We were on the first floor but the balcony still sits up off the ground due to sub-basement underneath. The view from our room was beautiful-you looked out onto the pool through the trees to the ocean. The green and brown from the lawn,trees and pool furniture mixed with all the different shades of blue from the pool, ocean and even the beach umbrellas was so lovely to look at. I don't think there could have been a better view in the entire resort. To reach the pool we simply took a right out of our room, another quick right through the double doors and we were right down the path from the beach towel shack. This was very convenient since this was our first stop every day anyway. Plus it wasn't a big hassle to run back to the room if needed. We were also as close to the beach as anyone else in the hotel. Our room was very nice. IT wasn't dated or the least bit shabby. I wish they had a few throw rugs but every hotel I've stayed at in the Caribbean has tile floors. The air conditioner was mac daddy! Almost too cold for me but my hubby was in heaven. The bed was extremely comfortable. Down comforter (not too heavy), down pillows and quality sheets contributed to some of the best sleep I've had in awhile. The bathroom was fairly roomy for a resort with nice fixtures and products from Bath & Body works provided. (shampoo,conditioner, lotion, \"cool it\" for sunburn) The breakfast buffet at Marbella was wonderful. My husband did complain that his scrambled eggs were cold one morning. I always got a made to order omelet followed by a large plate of tropical fruit. My husband ordered the Belgium waffle every morning which is cooked in front of you as well. Get one of these two things and you can't go wrong. Luisa makes the best omelets I've ever eaten. The buffet includes pretty much everything you can think of for breakfast, muffins, toast, yogurt, fruit, the usual eggs, bacon etc. They even had smoked salmon. The fresh cut up fruit was wonderful. The price is expensive however. We were on a companies dime so perhaps the food tasted even sweeter since we didn't pay for it out of pocket. The price for the breakfast buffet is over $20/person. I still would have eaten there if we had paid ourselves because it was so convenient to just wake up, walk straight down the hall and into the restaurant with hot coffee in front of you before you knew it. It was a wonderful way to start the day. Like others have said, drink prices are high. Pina Colada was almost $11 and wasn't even that big. We were coming back from an excursion and asked the shuttle driver to stop at a convenience store for us to buy beer. I would definitely recommend doing this. A six pack is $33 at the hotel. For two days we ordered lunch from Seabreeze at the beach. It was good. My husband got a hamburger and I got a curry chicken salad sandwich both days. The waitress gave me fries instead of chips the second day and seemed more than happy to bring me the chips right away. Actually we received cheerful, good service the entire time we were there. Someone else said the iguanas were a huge nuisance. We had a huge group and none of us had any problems with them. Yes, you see them everywhere, but I Tried to feed them and could hardly get one to come to me. I did see one fall (or jump) out of the tree at the pool, but it was more interesting than scary. As for being around the pool I only saw one or two and they were both lying on one of the big boulders that rim the pool just soaking up the sun. I Never saw them harass anyone. I would guess that if you had small children that were always wanting to chase them it could get annoying. To me they were way cool. Go around back of the hotel to the iguana pond if you really want to see them. Ask the attendant at the towel shack and they will point the way. I was able to feel a couple over there and it was cool. Things I would do again or differently: *If we went back I would rent a car at the airport and keep it for the entire trip. *Eat at Richies again- this restaurant is close to the hotel. It is open air and sits high on a hill with a spectacular view. The food was really good-the best meal we had while we were in Puerto Rico. Richie himself came over and hung out with us. Ambiance is great. Priced around $25-$40 for entree. *Bio-Bay Tour-this is a once in a lifetime, magical excursion. I could do this tour over and over! We booked through the hotel and paid extra which I wouldn't do again. Call around and set this up yourself-but definitely do it. *El Yunque visit-a group of us called for a shuttle to take us over the rainforest. He took us to all the sites that the tour you can book through the hotel does-but we paid the driver a total of $150 (split between 4 couples) as opposed to the $90/person charged through the resort. Our driver told us all about the flora and fauna and history too. This is the way to go if you ask me. If you rent a car just drive yourself. The welcome center has the nicest elderly man sitting at the information desk. He will explain everything you need to know to see what you want to see. It is a straight shot in and out so you can't get lost. BIG TIP: If you are going to hike to Mina Falls start at the higher (further into the forest) point and hike DOWN to the falls. If you are in a rental car then it won't be too bad to start of the nearest entry and walk to and from that way. Unless you are in Great shape and are looking for a workout-you don't want to get caught having to hike UP from the falls back to the pickup point. (You will understand all this as soon as you see the map they will give you at the visitors center-El Portal) Old San Juan-go into the city for dinner one night. If you have a group of people you can take a shuttle (around $130) ( If you are there with just your family or spouse I would suggest renting a car for the whole trip). Our group also went to San Juan during the day as well and toured the fort, which was beautiful and interesting. Be Very careful if you have kids with you because there are dangerously open areas high up on those fort walls that a person could easily fall over. The walls at these points are low and there is a drop off right before you get to them. We almost lost a guy in our group! *ATV tour- this tour was a lot of fun. I wouldn't make it a huge priority to do again...but I thoroughly enjoyed it while we doing it. Again, we booked through the hotel and probably paid extra. We were working with a group so this was just easier at the time. If I did it again I would call ahead and book it myself. The ATV tour was just FUN. We saw a HUGE iguana..probably 6 feet long. I had no idea they grew that large. We got to drive fairly fast and went through some pretty landscape. The tour claims to be \"in the rainforest\" but I would say it was more at the foothills. But still beautiful. We drove through some streams and ended up at a clear river where we got to swim and jump off semi-high rocks into the pool. This tour wasn't as education-but I had fun every second. Have Fun in beautiful Puerto Rico at the beautiful Rio Mar! I hope your vacation is as wonderful as ours was.

We arrived well before check in and thankfully our room was available. We were on the 7th floor with a view of the mountains and the rain forest; it was breathtaking! Our room was not dated; it was comfortable and had a terrace. We did rent a car but we did not go through the hotel's Avis rental. Instead, there is a place about 10 minutes down the road called \"Cabrerra\" that will pick you up at Rio Mar and drop you back off. The hotel pricing for the car rental was about $80/day which included insurance and Cabrerra car rental place was $55/day including insurance. We rented a Toyota Yaris and drove all over the island. We only needed $10 to replace the gas we used before we returned it. As indicated by others, it is best if you do things directly rather than going through the hotel. One day we went on a Catamaran Excursion. Through the hotel it was $115/person, directly through East Island Excursions in Puerto Del Mar (25 min from hotel) it was $147 for 2 people. We walked through the rain forest another day; through the hotel it was $65 per person for the tour, if you went directly they charge $5 (cash only) for the tour or you can walk through the rain forest with a map for free...we hiked through the rain forest to see the waterfall. It was beautiful. One afternoon we drove to the Kiosces in Loquillo beach (10 minutes from hotel) and had authentic Puerto Rican food for 1/8 of what you would pay at the hotel. For breakfast the second day we went to Antejolitos which is on the same road as the hotel near the bottom of the hill.

We did experience some issues - I forgot about the room key being demagnetized when it touches other credit cards, so at one point we could not get in the room, but again it was a quick fix. We had an issue with our safe as the screen seemingly froze on \"open\" but they quickly came and fixed it. People warned about the Iguanas and we certainly saw them, but they stayed on the grass - away from people. The reviews made it sound like the place was infested.

I used the Dragonfly airport transfers and this was the most economical way for a solo traveller although two or more vacationers may want a taxi since a taxi could stop and pick up supplies. I did feel bad for a group of four who had a small child and could not be provided with the child seat that was requested- Dragonfly had a booster seat designed for a much older child which could not be used for a 1-2 year old. Check in went smoothly and I was offered a basic room either on the first floor facing the pool/ocean or a 7th floor room facing the mountains- I picked the mountain view and believe that was the best choice. The view really was beautiful especially in the misty mornings and evenings. I found some travellers binoculors in my suitcase from a previous trip and enjoyed watching the tropical birdlife. I wasn't sure what to expect about the restaurant situation considering other reviews citing overpricing and poor quality and I was pleased not to agree with other reviewers. I found almost all of my meals to be reasonably priced and of high quality. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet a couple of times but went for the 'cold buffet' , $16 I think, which included fruit juice, a full carafe of coffee, fresh fruit buffet, pastries, cereal, and breads. It was worth my dollar because it also provided bagels that could be toasted with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and chopped onions which added a tasty sandwich to my breakfast. Pretty much all basic meals cost me about $20-22 with taxes and tip and the quality was very good and I thought that was reasonably priced. I was offered free refills on my soda during each meal that added to the value. I also ate about one meal a day from the ERL cafe next to the casino and this allowed me to save some $. I got a large morning coffee and a tasty carrot muffin some mornings, $8, and took them down to the beach or pool and was very content. They also have wraps, including caesar chicken salad and others, for about $8.50 that made a light lunch or dinner. I think two smaller children could comfortably share one wrap. I really enjoyed the roasted rosemary chicken and the greek chicken wrap at Marbella's for dinners at Marbella's. I also enjoyed the grilled swordfish at Palio's. The resort has good television stations including the major networks, HBO and HBO2, discovery, history channel, MTV, VH1, and 3-4 childrens channels. They had free fitness videos on demand including a number of yoga choices. I was super pleased that they allowed me to check out a yoga mat from the fitness center so I do the yoga in the room. I also enjoyed the fitness center which had 5-6 treadmills, 2-3 stair climbers, 3 bikes, free weights, and the standard weight machines. Most of the treadmills and stairclimbers had televisions that you could plug your earphones into. The fitness center definitely got crowded in the early morning hours but I had it to myself when I went during prime sun hours from 1-2pm. I was dissapointed that the resort advertised complimentary bicycle (outdoor) on the wyndham website but actually didn't offer that amenity. The housekeeping was great and timely and I appreciated the two small water bottles that were left in my room each day. There is an ice-machine on each floor and I filled my bucket each morning and then left it on the balcony table and could come back in the afternoon and refill my water bottles with tasty, icy cold water to take back to the pool. I somehow forgot to bring one of my toiletry bags with brushes, other hair stuff, etc. and appreciated that they offered the basic supplies at the resort store for very reasonable prices and they actually had a large, well thought out selection of all basic items. The resort store also offered cold sodas ($1.38), beer (2.99 per can plus tax), and wine. I bought a chilean shiraz for $23 which was not the highest quality but appreciated. I can understand the comments that alcoholic beverages were pretty pricey at the bars- do take advantage of the happy hour at the Tiki Bar from 4-6pm where you could get two for one drinks (only one selection of the day I think) or two PR beers for $5. The Seabreeze restaurant also offered a discounted drink of the day with lunch. The staff were uniformly professional and friendly and I thought the service was of very high quality. If you have a late return flight, be sure to join Wyndham Rewards and bring your number with you- I got a late 4pm check out which was really great. I would definitely recommend the resort and return. I am especially appreciative of the fact that they lent me the yoga mat, the reasonably priced resort store, the ERL cafe, and the great staff. I suggest they remove the inaccurate reference to complimentary bicycles on the website and suggest they rethink the 'fire-cracker' bread appetizer- it's a miss.", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGood enough for us and a fair review\u201d", "Author": "Chuck415", "ReviewID": "UR54133228", "Content": "We spent 8 nights at the Wyndham Rio Mar and let me say that my review of the Wyndham Rio Mar would have been much more critical if we hadn't got the deal from Travelocity that we did. If we had spent the most commonly listed amount I would have been very dissatisfied. Ultimately do your research as you're doing it now and make sure you find something comfortable for your budget. It is true the Wyndham Rio Mar is roughly 40 minutes away from Old San Juan, but it is 20 minutes away from Fajardo to catch a ferry to Culebra or Vieques. Ask the concierge for the most current ferry schedule. You must rent a car if you want to experience Puerto Rico based on the Wyndham's location. Let's talk prices since I know this interests a lot of you. $15.00 for self parking, but the ticket validation process is inconvenient. $20.00 for valet parking which might be worth it to some people considering the 5 minute walk to the parking garage depending on where your room is at the resort. $10 mixed drinks except for happy hour which has 2 for 1 151 rum punch and 2 for 1 beer specials. Ask the front desk for specific times of the happy hours and bar locations because the happy hour is short and earlier than usual. Room Service tacks on an additional $3.00 delivery charge and a percentage tax. I used room service to order 2 cokes, a pineapple juice, a strawberry daiquiri (no alcohol), and a Shrimp cocktail for $60.00. The shrimp cocktail was $14.00 for 5 shrimp and a tarter sauce. That is almost $3.00 per shrimp, but to there credit the shrimp were big. We ate at their sushi restaurant Shimas and walked out with a $130.00 bill easy, but we left very full of sushi between two of us. Desert was really the highlight. They also had karaoke at night there starting at 10:00 PM. The pros: *Most of the staff was nice. The location is close to El Yunque Rain Forest and to Fajardo ferry station. The pool is open ALL the time. The water slide is open from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Huge jacuzzi The beach isn't spectacular in comparison to other beaches on the island, but makes for a lot of fun. Most importantly it was clean! True, we found plenty of live sand dollars at our feet. You can walk out 150 feet and still be at chest high deep water. 11:00AM iguana feeding! If you go for their timeshare pitch you get a $75.00 room credit and \"continental\" breakfast (only juice, a prepackaged pastry, coffee, and a apple or banana). We were close to signing, but didn't want to make a hasty decision. They have a casino with free drinks, but they only come around every 30-40 minutes for a drink request. The cons: Upon arrival we were greeted by a nice young gentleman at the front desk, but after a rewards question we were interrupted and told by his manager that our Wyndham Rewards membership was no good because we used a 3rd party (i.e. Travelocity, Expedia, Orbitz, etc) to book our stay. Fine we weren't interested in the reward points, but what about the benefits (i.e. free internet, fruits, and other welcoming gifts)? The answer from the young bald managerial type behind the front desk was \"no.\" He was less courteous than the initial gentleman checking us in. I wanted to ask what kind of membership is this? I assume this young bald gentleman had an inferiority complex. I was on vacation so whatever and I'm happy he isn't my boss, but watch out for him. Other people here have mentioned him as well. Other cons worth note: The brown spot on our blanket (it was there on arrival) was obvious, but the cleaning staff never changed it. Stains on the tile. Yes bugs will appear in your room if you leave the patio open. Apparently the tile is mopped, but a dried worm was on the floor in the same spot for days. Sure I could complain about those things, but I'm not the type to care, well the blanket was disturbing, but I shouldn't have to waste my time calling in the obvious to hotel services. Bloody Marys were decent, but apparently the hotel ran out of celery. I used room service at 2:30 AM and it took an hour to get a soda, canned pineapple juice, a daiquiri, and shrimp cocktail. I almost fell back asleep before it came. Ultimately the rooms are so so. We got a ocean front room, but it was hard to see on the 3rd floor. The palm trees really blocked the view. I suggest something above the 3rd floor. I'll put it plainly. If you can get this resort for a great price like I did fine, but if you're spending the hotel direct prices it is a gamble. Go in with medium expectations. Then again I was here for 8 nights so somethings may not be as obvious to those staying for a couple days. Honestly Puerto Rico is beautiful. The Wyndham didn't do it for me, rather the island did. 3 stars for the Wyndham.

The resort was 98% full so they were not too accomodating in switching us so we coulddall be a bit closer, however when we talk to the manager within 15 minutes we were all within 2 floors on the same wing. The rooms are what you would expect - nothing over the top but be were only in them to sleep. The views of the ocean and pool were beautiful.

There is a coffee shop right outside the casino but be prepared to wait - 20 minutes for 2 cups of coffee - they just need more help. We also ate at the japanese restaurant - delicious! and they accomodated 23 people with no problem. The pool restaurant had a grouper salad that was awesome. We went to Richie's (expensive) but we had so much fun and Richie was there and couldn't have been any nicer! We went to the grocery store for water soda and snack and rented refrigerators ($10/night- we should have only rented 4) ACTIVITIES - there is a volley ball net in the pool and various lawn games set out each morning - croquet, bocce and shuffleboard - watch out for the roaming and swimming iguanas! the beach was nice. EXCURSIONS: 13 of us went ATVing thru the rain forest -- soooo much fun! worth every penny especially for the teens. 7 of us went horsback riding and we loved it. 19 of us did the zipline tour through the rainforest --- experience this! it's 8 zips through the rainforest a bit of hiking and rapelling. All of the excursions were set up by the concierge - we may have paid a bit more but they included travel and we felt it was well worth it. My only complaint would be the keys to the room - after may trips to the front desk for rekeying --- we were told the keys demagnatize if you put them by your cell phone or other credit cards - we felt they demagnitized no matter were you put them. by the end of our trip we must have gone through at least 100 keys between all of the rooms - SO FRUSTRATING!!! we had security up to see if it was the doors but it was the keys (good chance there was some \"user error\" too) All in all if the only complaint I have is the keys.....I must have had an incredible time!", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cAverage Rooms, Great Location and Solid Service\u201d", "Author": "rideboards", "ReviewID": "UR53890314", "Content": "My wife and I just got back from a 5 day stay at the Rio Mar.

The grounds are well kept, the bell service and front desk are courteous and the lobby is very nice. Upon entering the room, you immediately notice that they are dated. The air conditioning unit was loud, the noise from the hotel was louder, and the noise coming from the door separating our room from our neighbors was loudest. Since we didn't spend too much time in our room these problems were acceptable. The beach was very nice. There are plenty of chairs to lounge on and the pool was also very nice if you got sick of the beach. All in all, this is a good choice if you can get a good price. The location, beach, and courteous staff make for a solid value. However, the place is a bit dated and everything is expensive (15.00 for a burger by the pool) so I suggest renting a car and eating at the kiosks and bakeries around the area.

It was a beautiful hotel and the staff were all very nice and accomodating. We stayed there for a week the Mon-Wed the place was not busy AT all but once Thursday came around the place really filled up. It did rain for 2 1/2 days.......There were six of us ranging from ages (59-1 yr old) overall everyone had a very nice time. 3 1/2 stars :) The hotel is not too far from San Juan (30 min) and a easy drive. RENT A CAR, there is not a ton to do at the resort, and fun adventures nearby. Outside of the resort we went on a great Catermaran snorkling boat trip with the SALTY DOG. Great fun staff was super friendly, the lunch was prefect (small buffet of salads, breads, fruit, and drinks included) and it was fun. Snorklling wasnt the best, but still a really fun day for all (maybe wouldnt be so greaat for people who are really into snokling). Easy top get to. On a rainy day, when we couldn't go to the beach to drove up to the rain forest. It was beautiful and a fun adventure, though it was pouring! Do not waste money on a rainforest excursion....drive yourself, they have infomation both at the Rio Mar and there is a tourist center at the beginning of the rain forest. FOOD- Food at the Rio Mar was a little pricy ($22.00) for a breakfast buffet...but although way too much for breakfast, we splurged since we were on vacation and it was fabulous....everything u could think of to eat!!!!! Outside the resort there is a public beach Luquillo. It was nice for a change, Umbrellas and chairs to rent but still be arounf the locals. Honestly, Rio Mar's beach is better and the chair and umbrella is included. :). The kiouses (sp) at the beach are a great place to eat for lunch even if you dont go to the beach. For a quick snack #1 has TRUE PR food. SOOOO good. There is a good chance you might be the only tourist at this spot, but people are nice down at the end there is another resturant La Pallara I think it called(it will stick out becasue it is the only one with a nice sign) has GREAT food. Richies was nice but the food was over priced. A GREAT place was Haciendas the Bamboo Lounge Resturant. Get passed the car when you first get out of the car because it is on a hourse ranch, and the place is GREAT! Food is great and so is the servce and there is a free shuttle to get there....also lots of stuff to do at the ranch. Take a trip to Old San Juan, again you can drive there, lots a garages to park i and the hotle will give you typed out directions. Lots of shops, bars and resturants and you have to go to the BLESSED CAFE. A reggage bar that makes you think you are in JAmaica and an owner, Anothy is a really nice and friendly guy. Rooms were nice and clean....they provided a nice clean crib for my daughter. The biggest compliant is the lack of nightlight........according to my 24 y/o brother and his gf they didnt need a club but the only outisde bar closes at 6PM. So at night you are either drinking in the lobby or wasteing your money at the casino. Some steal drums and outside drinking would have been nice. Pool area was great both a kiddie pool that was perfect for my 15 month old, family pool and an adult pool were all nice and clean. Beach was beautiful.

Check in was easy but they immediately were pressuring us to schedule a meeting to show us the resort and do a walk through. (We never went) We checked into our room which had a balcony with a view of the ramp to the valet. No beach view...just palm trees full of iguanas.

This could be a decent place for a long weekend or family retreat. It's got a decent beach, it's close to El Junque ( the rain forest), and not far from San Juan Airport. However, it needs a big infusion of cash or failing that, a new management that CARES to take over. Rooms vary widely in quality. We had two nothing special rooms that were supposed to have \"stunning views of the Atlantic\", but most of that was obscured by palm trees. While the beds were very comfortable, the room was showing signs of wear and tear, from the cracked tiling in the bathroom to the stained curtains. On the plus side, the room was cleaned thoroughly every day, and it was very quiet. The beach in front of the hotel could be very nice if the staff would ever clean it. I don't mean to sound like a princess, but is it that hard to post signs for guests to pick up their trash, and/or have the hotel staff clean up? We found the sand littered with everything from cigarette butts to plastic cutlery left over from lunch. Really a shame. Hotel services varied widely according to which staff member was helping you. The main phone sometimes went unanswered, and when we called about a short-lived plumbing issue in our room, the staff member sounded annoyed. Public rooms and the casino are nice ( though the casino's a bit on the small side), but the gym is poorly maintained. I nearly slid off a treadmill because it wasn't grounded properly, and other equipment was not working at all. And now for the worst part.... THE RESTAURANTS! As I said earlier, either management doesn't care, or they think their guests won't notice because they've had too much sun. But are they serious?! The food reminded us of what you might get ( if you were lucky) at an elementary school cafeteria.While I'm not suggesting that they need to bring in a celebrity chef ( although maybe not such a bad idea to draw people to the hotel in such a remote area), they need to completely re-think their menus and food choices at all the restaurants. Pricing too, is insanely expensive. Nearly $8.00 for two very small black coffees at the under-staffed lobby coffee shop. Also- in fairness- it would be nice to let guests know that in slow times, only a few restaurants are open each day. If we had known this, we probably would have booked elsewhere, although we did OK, by going off-property to RITCHIE'S, a local Puerto- Rican restaurants, where the owner actually seemed to care about the quality of the food and the care of his guests.

We avoided all meals like the plague and felt sorry for all those people who were eating and constantly complaining. (Keep reading .. there is plenty more below..) We shopped at Amigos the first day and got all we needed for making our own breakfasts and lunches (took cereal in baggies with plastic utensils and bowls, plates, etc. from home and just bought the milk and fruit etc.).

It would be a perfect location for something like Four Seasons. Unfortunately, it is not one. In fact, it lacks some services of 2-star resorts. Let me elaborate. First, on positive, besides excellent beach, the hotel is close to El Yunque rain forest, which is great for those enjoying nature. It also has plenty of places to eat from breakfast-buffet/casual dining restaurant, a bar on the beach, a lobby bar, and a coffee shop to formal dining and sushi restaurant to 24-hour in-room dining. The food price is moderate-to-expensive. The resort has a lot of activities, children club, and four free Internet station (Internet access on your computer is available otherwise for a fee.) We also liked the valet service, as it was very efficient. As for the rooms, they look good with exception of a broken off trim, which nobody from the maintenance had seemed to notice. The bed is soft and comfortable. The room had a small balcony with ocean view. On not so positive note, there are the following. Internet access is charged per computer, not per room. Thus if you have a laptop and iPod Touch, you would need to pay twice (even for by Request members). The hotel is not well prepared for business travelers because their business center is only opened 9-5, so if you want to print something at other times, you are out of luck. The concierge desk, which is not aware that the hotel has a business center (seriously), can only print your boarding passes till 10pm. Dining at the restaurants: breakfast selection is ok (they used to have more berries, pastries, and meats last year, as well as better eggs). I do agree with another post early that the hotel restaurant reservation may not be recorded, so when you arrive at the restaurant, you might realize that you are not on the list. We did not learn that they did not have the reservation until 20 minutes after we had arrived. Their restaurant manager, who looked like a kid, was very rude. He did not believe us that we had made the reservation and literally told us to wait \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas everyone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 if we wanted to eat. Wow. The room: we had a table lamp missing, so we called for it. The maintenance man arrived and brought us one, but without working bulb, so he had to go to bring it. The bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mirror looked unclean and they forgot to replace almost empty shampoo bottle. The door to outside would not easily unlock with the keycard, you have to pull the door, and then swipe it a few times. When closing the door, you had to push it hard to close; otherwise, it would not lock securely. The activities: despite hefty 14% resort fee, there is nothing included. It is basically disguised extra room rate. You have to pay for all and every sport activity, internet, phone, parking, etc. The Ritz Carlton in San Juan has free internet, free phone calls, 24-hour business center, and non-motorized water sports included into resort fee charge. The spa: we did not experience one because they wanted to charge us 20% Mandatory! Tips (The Ritz will let you choose the percentage). I do believe that tips should be based on service, not forced upon, especially outside of the restaurants, and certainly not at 20% rate. Medical: if you get a headache, you are in trouble because the front desk would not give you any meds (which is understandable) and they do not have a place to buy Tylenol late in the evening. They also do not have a cardiac defibrillator, so if somebody gets a heart attack or chokes and his/her heart stops beating properly, they would be as good as dead at the hotel. The front desk informed me that they did not have any CPR training, only security guards, and they would call a hospital to send in an emergency team. Well, irrespective of the hospital location (which is 17 miles away), it would take a car at least 2.5 minutes to get from the gates to the hotel. Please do remember that brain death occurs in 5 minutes, and defibrillator is the most efficient in the first 3 minutes, while CPR without the defibrillation is only effective in few cases.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cGreat Start to our week in Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "pepperbluemd", "ReviewID": "UR52968211", "Content": "We were here for two days beginning New Year's Day.

Direct flt about 3 \u00c2\u00bd hrs. They are ahead of us by 1 hr. Although you need your passport there are no customs inspections. Puerto Rico is a US territory. Everyone here speaks English although Spanish amongnst themselves. People are friendly, helpful but sometimes on island time. The island is clean with many things to see and do. Having been to many Caribbean islands and Mexico I would rank it high based on ease of travel and beauty of island and many attractions. Rio Mar resort thoughts: This is a large resort 600 rooms and 72 suites. Its about 45-60 minutes from San Juan airport ($75 if take a cab). Hotel is shaped in a large U with center a nice courtyard. Legs of U extend to ocean. One side faces the ocean the other side the mountains. The hotel has nice architectural design of high decorated ceilings, large marble columns, stone stairs, iron railings and ornate colorful tile floors. Everything is painted in warm earth tones. There are plenty of common areas to hang-out at on main floor (lobby area). It is clean and very well maintained. Our room (6034) was considered an oceanview room. It definelty had a good view of the ocean but was not classic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oceanfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You will of course pay more for this view but we thought it worth it. Room was decorated in earth tones with tile floor, nice flat screen TV, granite bathroom sink. Not A++ but very nice. Beds are incredible comfortable. Bars/Lounges: There are 4 bars on property, lobby bar fairly lg with seating around it and 3 large TV screens around the bar showing ESPN. Bolero is a smaller bar on ground level (1 floor below the lobby). Last is Tiki bar directly on the beach adjacent to large family pool bar food is also available here. Also is sm bar in the casino. Is sm room with 4 computers for internet useage in lobby area, no cost here however 15/dy in your room or anywhere else on your own computer. There are 3 main restaurants directly in Hotel, a coffee shop and 2 in nearby golf clubhouse (1mi). Shimas-serves asian food including sushi-food and service is very good Palio-italian restaurant again v good food Marabella-main dining area where buffets are served bkfst, lunch and dinner (themed dinners nightly) In golf club is Iguanas pub (very good pub food) and the Grille Room a steakhouse with slow service but overall very good food. Coffee shop has good coffee, muffins, bagels and wraps. We found all of food to be reasonably good. Be aware that everything is expensive. $22 brkst buffet, $4 cups of coffee and $10 mixed drinks. Dinners are all ala carte and range in price from 18-48 dollars. Many restaurants, small grocery store and bakery are close to the resort but must have a car to get there. I would suggest several dinners in and several off resort. The concierge staff is v. good at helping with recommendations and reservations. Beach is wide with brown sand and ample space to lay out. Ocean water was very warm with big waves this week. Many chairs but as usu not enuf during x-mass week. Need to get up early to get a chair and umbrella. Exclusive poolside cabanas are available for $150/day private service and nice treats. There is a large kids pool with a neat waterslide and an adjacent adult only pool. Both pools have nice hot tubs adjacent to them. Watersports including diving, kayaks, waverunners etc are available to rent. Waitress service is available on the beach with a Tiki bar close to both pools and the beach. A full service spa is available along with a small casino (no $5 blackjack tables but lg enuf to enjoy). We did not use the spa. Two golf courses are available Ocean and River Courses. I played them both. Florida- like with fairway lined palm trees and man-made lakes. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a touch expensive at $150+tx (x-mass week). Nice layouts and in decent shape. Grass is groomed but not real dense. Hardly anyone playing. Very attentive staff. Tennis is also available. A shuttle runs thru the property every 10 min (not nec unless golfing, tennis or eating at golf clubhouse). There is a well staffed concierge desk to help schedule dinners and excursions. Need to plan in-house dinners day or two in advance. Excursions are well organized but expensive mostly about 100/person. Many trips can be done alone by car (Culebra, rain forest, drive into San Juan). However if choose this need to research before you get here for details. Overall thoughts: We spent the week after Christmas at this resort. Weather is predicabtably warm (mid 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) but it rained 3 of 7 days. This is a nice resort in a good location (but far from town of San Juan). Intersting architecture and large grounds. It was busy x-mass week and loaded with young children (a fare amt of noise). Staff are neat, attentive and eager to please however this is not a JW or 4 seasons category resort. Food was generally very good but expensive. Also expensive is room rate, 700+/night for typical hotel room (x-mass week). A car would be very helpful to eat out and sight see. I would probably not return (my kids are older) but would recommend it for families that can manage the costs and have young children. Most people here from US very few Europeans. Puerto people all speak English and are very pleasant and helpful. Remember if go Christmas week it is there busiest time and everything especially food preparation takes more time than you are used to.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Hoyamd", "ReviewID": "UR52409850", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for the last week of Dec 09.

I had called a few times before arriving to request a room not on the ground floor based on previous recs from TA. However on arrival, the lady at the front desk appeared very stressed and was not friendly at all and we ended up with a room on the ground floor. She asked us to check again on Sunday and we did to no avail. The hotel grounds were beautiful. The pools and the beach were great. It was almost impossible to find beach/pool lounge chairs after 10AM. We appreciated that the pool was open 24 hrs so night swims were amazing as the pools were usually empty. There are many restaurants on the hotel property and the prices is what you would expect for a US resort. My biggest gripe is that the hotel charges 25 dollars per day for resort fee but the parking and the internet are still extra. I do not know what the resort fee is for. The hotel used to be Westin. In Westin Maui, you pay the same resort fee but that covers internet and parking. The way the parking works is 15dollars per day (20 for valet) but you have to validate the parking ticket every time you leave. The hotel is about 30 minutes outside San Juan so you need a car if you are staying here. We ate at Ismmar bakery at the bottom of the hill. Their Pastrami sandwich and pastries were to die for.

Purpose: Beach and Relaxation Beach - was lovely! Water wasn't blue as one would expect, but lots of waves. Beach is expansive. You can walk and walk. Beach is wide enough to hold a lot of people. The hotel wasn't not even half full; so getting lounge chairs wasn't difficult. Shade is mandatory for me - We were able to get umbrellas every day, but it was a pain. I can't even imagine what a horrendous experience it would have been if the hotel was full. Sometimes the umbrella guys get there at 9, sometimes 10, who knows. I am willing to get up early, but then having to wait 1 hour for the umbrella guys to show up is really annoying - could have slept in! Then you have to wait in a makeshift line for an umbrella. Yet you see people sitting down and paying a bribe not to have to wait in line and getting an umbrella immediately. That was unpleasant. You had to wait 15-20 min for an umbrella. Remember, hotel is not even full yet. You could get beach service or walk up to the bar/grill. Drinks: Pricey and average. I had tropical drinks and they were ok. They are made out of bottled fruit concoctions not fresh fruit. Food: Breakfast was good. But very slooooooooow. All I wanted was corned beef hash in the morning and it took over 20 min to get. So if you are not doing the buffet, but ordering off the menu, allow pleny of time - espicailly for families or large groups. Lunch - the outdoor places on the premises were ok but pricey. Dinner - We opted to have dinners outside of the resort. Highly recommend you try local spots in neighboring towns. Room: The room was really nice on the 7th floor. I have high hurdles to meet; so my comment here can be trusted. Our room had a balcony with a kind of ocean view. We paid for the cheapest room but the balconies are at an angle where most rooms have a 30% view of the ocean/beach. The room felt fresh and updated. The bathroom was not as nice. It was clean and the sink area was fine but the bathtub looked a worn and didn't drain well towards the mid to end of your shower. The maid did a good job of cleaning the sand everyday. The room is comparable to high-end Marriott. It is not luxury. Internet - Free interet use by the receptionist. Kids are ALWAYS on them. Just ask nicely to use and they scamper out. Nightline: Be prepared to make your own nightlife. Casino was never happening and the bar areas had scattered numbers of people. I didn't ding them on the ratings for this because I didn't cate about a happening nightlife. Service: Was not good. We should have received complimentary wine and cheese the 1st night. We had to keep calling and finally received the 3rd night. When I checked in, check-in was the normal slow pace (20 min). I prepared myself for this; so did not blow a gasket, but why does it take so long - it's all computerized!! When I went to my room, key didn't work, went back down. They gave me a new key. Went back up - still not working. Called them from a hall phone - they said someone would be right over. No one came up - had to call again. I think it took them 20-30 min to come up. That's in addition to the above 20 min. Then they had to fix the door lock, which took more time. So from the time it took when I entered the lobby to the time it took to get down to the beach was an 1hr 20. Service with the umbrella guys were patchy. Service at the receptionist with the whole parking and paying for it took a while. SUMMARY: the little contact we had with staff was slow. BUT they were always polite. I didn't ding the hotel on the rating for poor service because the service that we required was minimal. If you require a lot of attention, prepare yourselft for slow fixes, etc. Location: PERFECT. Hotel is 5 min from the rainforest. Does not cost a cent to hike up or down. 30 min to san juan. 20 min to get to smaller towns on the other side. Car: For a great vacation, a car is a must. Try dinners in the smaller neighboring towns. Hiking. Going all the way to the end of the island - opposite direction of going to san juan. Do stop by the roadside fruit mkts - very good. Summary: Go for the lovely beach; nice rooms. Don't go for food, drinks, nightlife or great service. Do leave the resort and explore.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with an excellent location\u201d", "Author": "DTailer", "ReviewID": "UR51941172", "Content": "We stayed at the Rio Mar Resort the week before Christmas. We had our 17 year old niece with us who likes adventure and chose this hotel for the location. The hotel is within 5 minutes of El Yunque National Forest, a 25 minute drive to Fajardo and nearby marina (Puerto Del Ray Marina), a 10 minute drive to a Zip Line tour called Yunke Zip Line Adventure, and a 5 minute drive to horseback riding on the beach. We did all of these over a 3-day period and it was phenomenal. More about these tours later. The resort itself is beautiful with \"Hyatt\" like grounds, a great pool area, and a close to perfect beach area. The beach is not rocky, it is very expansive for long walks, it has plenty of beach area and chairs/umbrellas, and it also has shady areas under trees if you prefer to get out of the sun. There are not any large resorts next door so it has a secluded feel to it. One of the calm days, we were able to swim out quite far and still be in chest high water where we picked up sand dollars off the ocean floor with our feet. This is not a snorkel beach, however, as there is not any coral close enough in-shore. There is a reef off shore that you can see and you might be able to rent one of the kayaks they offer on the beach, but we did not try that. Our last day, it was very rough with high waves because a storm was coming in. Rooms: We reserved two ocean view rooms and they put us on the 4th floor where the palm trees blocked our view. You really cannot get a good \"ocean view\" type room until you go up to the highest floor, which is the 7th floor. Ocean \"front\" rooms had better views at lower floor levels. The pool, ocean, pool bar, and water sport facilities were all very close and convenient, no matter where your room was. You did not have to walk a mile to get out to the beach area. The staff and service overall was incredible....they were all very nice and accomodating. The rooms we were in were more like Marriott Courtyard quality, not luxury resort quality, but the rest of the resort (lobby, restaurants, pool, grounds, etc) were high-end. I think if they would repaint the guest rooms a different color and have a more tropical decor, it would help. One warning is that the concierge staff are timeshare solicitors and not really very helpful in giving advice about the local area. We asked them about a snorkel beach and after the timeshare push, they told us to go to a beach in Fajardo that was supposedly a great snorkel beach, but it was not. They seemed to be trained in timeshare sales, and the hotel-sponsored tours and that's about it. We got our best local advice from Jose, the bellman who greeted us our first day. He was awesome! We researched and set up all our tours ourselves. Free wireless in the lobby if you have your laptop with you and it worked really well. We drove to El Yunque, paid the $3.00 per person entrance fee, stopped by the visitors center and got a map and directions. You can drive thru the Tropical Rainforest and they have parking areas along the way. From there you can hike to different areas. The trails were very well maintained and the parking was easy to find and convenient. The second tour we did was the Biobay tour with East Winds. It is the only biobay tour that does not require you to kayak. You meet at the Marina Puerto Del Ray in Fajardo at 4:30pm and they go over to Vieques on a high spped catamaran. You have dinner on Vieques, then they take you to the bay (via a schoolbus...crazy drive) where you board an electric boat to go swim in the bay. It is something you HAVE to do. Absolutely unbelievable. Phone:[--]. The zip line tour we chose was with Yunke Zipline Adventure. This is within a 10 minute drive of the resort. Super professional, top notch instructors who love the environment and prepare you for a safe and once in a lifetime adventure (8 ziplines, 3 rappels in the tropical rainforest). You will love these guys! Plus, because they are so close, they offer half day tours (morning and afternoon) so you can fit it into your schedule. You need to do this zipline if you are staying anywhere in the northeast section of the island. Phone: [--]. We saw a sign posted on a building that said \"Horseback Riding on the Beach\" and called them. They were right down the road from the resort. Their official name is Catch a Dream. Phone: [--]. It was only $50.00 per person if you called them direct. You horseback ride through the woods until you get to the beach. Then you ride on the beach for about 45 minutes. The entire ride is 1.5 hours and it is spectacular. When you arrive at the ranch, it looks kinda run down and not very impressive, but the ride and experience is great. On a scale of 1-10, we are only about 3 in our experience and had a great time. Again, this is a morning or afternoon event and you can fit it in after your zipline tour (like we did :).

Zandra at the front desk checked us in and was awesome! Eduardo from the bell stand was also great. The hotel was 1/4 full and we were upgraded to ocean view. We had two aoining rooms, one of which was ADA accessible. Both rooms were clean, with upgraded bathrooms and Bath and Body Works amenities. In room Puerto Rican coffee was delicious. Nice beds and pillows. Our rooms were really quite nice! Our third floor view of the ocean was partially blocked by palm trees next to our balcony, but this turned out to be great because of the birds, iguanas and geckos to watch! The kids loved this. As a brand new Wyndam Rewards member, I received a fruit plate and wine as a welcome gift. The grounds were beautiful and pools well-maintained. There are a few iguanas around the pool and we attended the iguana feeding in the back of the hotel which was very cool. The staff member provided a very educational talk and answered everyone's questions. We did not enroll our children (12 yrs. and 9 yrs.) in the kids club but we checked it out and there are plenty of activities. The staff at the kids club and around the pool were really friendly towards our children. The public beach in front of the hotel is raked each morning and we saw no trash around. Only a few restaurants were open but I wouldn't expect them all to be except during peak season. Marbellas is the casual restaurant and the meals were tasty. My server did not charge me for my pina colada since it too awhile to bring it. Great service. My husband only checked his emails once (yey!) and found the internet to be super slow, but it was free and as leisure travelers it was adequate for our needs. We used self-parking ($15/day) and it was fine. There is a small casino and there is a nice gift shop. A word about the prices...this is a \"Full Service Resort.\" Yes, the prices are high but they are in line with any resort on the island, the US, Mexico, Canada, Caribbean. Please understand that while room rates might be discounted, you are booking a resort stay and prices will reflect that. We took the advice of other reviewers and rented a car, stocked up on drinks and snacks at Wal-mart and ate most of our meals outside of the resort. The Isamar panaderia and Palmer bakery across Rt. 3 had delicious $3 breakfast sandwiches. Richies was a nice spot to have a drink but we did not eat there. We ate at the luquillo kioskos down the road. El efe was really good, the others were ok. As far as the hotel property itself, the location is perfect if you want to get out and see the island. We found the rain forest, snorkeling, bio bay excursions, horseback riding, tennis, the ferry to Culebra and Vieques and beautiful beaches are all less than 25 minutes away. Bring a portable GPS with you if you have one, as this made the roads easy to navigate. We zipped around in our rental car and my husband was driving like a local by the second day!

Easy to get to the resort from the airport, maybe 20-25 minute ride, which is nothing comparitively speaking. It was a 40th birthday trip so we splurged on an Excellence Club Rooftop Terrace Room...definitely worth it. A note of caution, get your room in building 9 on the 4th floor, otherwise everyone else has a view of you on your rooftop terrace. The room and the view from our room were outstanding. Having two balcony choices was very nice, and each one comes with a variety of seating options. The splash pool on the rooftop is not heated in any way shape or form, and took a bit to get used to. Temps were in the mid 80's during our week so we were never so hot that it required a splash. Still used it though, just understand it is not a hot tub! Very relaxing. The bathrooms could be an issue unless you are very familiar with your travel companion, the bathroom doesn't have a solid wall between it and the bedroom, so when using the potty it is kind of like you are right there...weird, but you get over it. The Excellence Club is a great options, easy check-in/check-out, upgraded toiletries, concierge, but the best part was the actual Excellence Club. Tucked into building 8 is the actual private Excellence club, that only club members can utilize. It had concierge service, 3 computers with internet, TV/lounge, bar, and a buffet at all times it was open. We actually ate breakfast there one morning. Very nice to have a place you could go to have issues addressed, and to check in with home if you needed to. Worth the upgrade in our opinion. The pool was fine for our needs, but could seem a bit crowded later in the morning. It isn't very big and with everyone on their rafts it could seem a bit stacked up. At this time of year only the main pool with the swim up bar was heated so the lazy river side was a bit shocking when you first got it, but tolerable. We never had a problem finding a spot at the pool. Bars around every corner, not all of them open all the time, but we never had a problem finding a drink or finding somone to get us one. Mango Margaritas/Daquiris were really good. Live music around the pool and Cafe Kafe bar was nice. There were activities and the resort has a newsletter that you get everyday to advise you of them, and other resort information, but after that it was up to you. No one ever announced activites that were happening right at the pool, a lot of things we just happened to stumble upon. We only went to one of the evening shows, and it was pretty good. Didn't spend a lot of time on the beach, but it was sandy, no big rocks in the water like other parts of Cancun. Lots of seating options and towels. The food was really good in our opinion. We are not fussy food people, but found the options great, and the taste super. Barcelona was the only place we ate breakfast, and they had plenty of options at the buffet. For Lunch we went to Chop House. We went to Agave (Mexican) twice (try the Lobster Burrito and Sopa Azteca), Spice (Asian), Lobster House, Chop House for dinner and found them all to be outstanding. The dress code a little more relaxed here than other all inclusives which was nice, and not having to make reservations for dinner was so great. We could just decide right as we were walking out the door where we wanted to go. Only waited for seating one time (we ate closer to 7:30 that night) and that was only a 10 minute wait. Staff was very friendly and very helpful, we tipped accordingly. Used the spa, it was a beautiful facility--did the couples Vitality Massage and it was really nice. Any massage and you get a complimentary Hydrotherapy circut which my husband enjoyed. The resort is compact so it is easy to get from one place to another, but it never seemed crowded. We booked two excursions through Olympus Tours...Selvetica Corona Rally and BOB (see my reviews for those). BOB was a water excursion and visibility was an issue do to offshore moving of sand into the beaches, the tour gave us free t-shirts because it was something they couldn't predict was happening at the time we went out.

The resort was absolutely beautiful! I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about it. The staff was friendly and helpful. A lot of the restaurants were closed with it being the slow season, but we ate at Marbella several times and it was excellent and very reasonably priced. We tried the Kiosks that everyone talked about. I thought they were just o.k. It was the typical rice and beans and fried food. Unless you plan on just lying near the pool or on the beach or playing golf (they have great golf courses!), you will definitely need a car to get anywhere. The resort is located right across from El Yunque Rainforest. As others have said, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to take a tour. If you have a car, just drive over. Take the time to see the video in the welcome center. Even my husband, who hates those videos, said it was enjoyable and worth watching. Do not miss visiting the island of Culebra when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to drive to Fajardo (about a 30 minute drive) and catch the ferry over to Culebra. Parking for the ferry is $5 and the ferry is $5.00 round trip. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 1 \u00c2\u00bd hour ferry ride to the island where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll catch a bus ($3) to the most beautiful beach I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen. The water there is gorgeous and you can snorkel right off the beach. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a camp ground right off the beach for anyone who wants to spend more than a day. If you go, go during the week. I heard the week-ends can be quite crowded on the ferry and boarding is very slow. You can also catch a ferry there to Vieques which I was told is another really nice island. On Saturdays you can get a two-hour ferry to St. Thomas. The only down side (which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one for me because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an early to bed person) is that there is not a lot of night life at the resort. The resort has a casino and a bar, but otherwise, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really was nothing to do at night. All and all, it was a great time, a great hotel, and I would highly recommend it.

Overall I felt ridiculously price gouged at this resort. $4 stale 3 inch cookies. $20 two egg breakfast. $5 for 10 oz. glass of Tropicana orange juice. Seriously? I don't mind paying for quality food but honestly, the quality I experienced here was no better than a Denny's. If you're going to charge Ritz Carlton prices the quality should be there and is seriously lacking at this resort. I was served a $12 bowl of tomato bisque at their high end restaurant that was laughable for two reasons: #1 it wasn't a bisque (there was no cream in the soup and shame on any Chef working a \"high end\" restaurant who doesn't know this) #2 I suppose they thought I wouldn't notice that they were serving me the marinara sauce used in the pasta and pizza as soup. Grounds were lovely and well kept. Rooms were comfortable in a mid-price range kind of way. Ocean view rooms are worth the additional costs. We looked at suites and besides having a sofa, we did not feel they were much different from the standard ocean view room. Service was always friendly. DO RENT A CAR !!! Driving was not much different from driving in the states and the savings in food, tour costs etc will more than make up for the parking costs. Don't even waste your money on a $70 tour of El Yunque. It's a 15 minute drive from the resort and admission to the information center (well worth it) is $3 per person. The resort is about a 45 min drive from the action of Condado and San Juan, 10 minutes from the lovely beaches of Luquillo and a Safeway-esque grocery store (Amigos?). We did splurge on $60 historical tours to Old San Juan which we felt were worth the costs given the driving distance, congestion and parking challenges of Old San Juan.

Would not want to pay full price during high season. We went the last week of October and the hotel was very quiet. Temperature was about 87 degrees and partly cloudy. If it did rain, only for a minute and cleared up again. The hotel is at the base of the rainforest and the cloud formations that come across are amazing. That time of year it gets dark at 6pm. Location: Secluded. Comfortable. So close to the rainforest. The pools are wonderful. Adult pool was very relaxing. At night we would slip into the pool after dinner and had the pool to ourselves. No one said a thing to us. In the morning before breakfast you can take long walks on the beach!! The ocean was enjoyable too.. get out beyond the crash of wave and the water was not crystal clear.. but clear enough. At your feet are tons and tons of live sand dollars! Food: Our stay came with breakfast buffet. Mon - Wed they didn't have enough people to have the buffet but you could order what you wanted off the menu instead. It wasn't exactly perfect as you couldn't choose a little of this or that.. but they made it work. Otherwise food and drinks were expensive. We stopped off at the grocery on the way in to purchase alcohol, wine, soda's, water and plastic glasses. Bring a collapsible cooler on the top of your suitcase and you have everything you need. Rooms. Beds are very comfortable. Floors are tile and clean. Towels are nice white and fluffy. Keep your sliding glass door closed or the rooms get super humid. Rooms are quiet. You don't hear any noise from your neighbors. Restaurants. The hotel has lots of options for nearby restuarants who will come and pick you up at the hotel and bring you back. Richey's and the Hacienda were just 2. Richey's has an amazing view overlooking the hotel from the mountains. The Hacienda has the best flank steak by far! Prices were pretty reasonable for eating out in a \"nicer\" Puerto Rican restaurant. We were a mix of locals and tourists. Certainly LaParilla at the Loquido Kiosks was by far our favorite. Get the coconut shrimp! Yum!! I ate them twice!! Get a car and a good map. We used the Map, GPS and the concierge provides fabulous typed up directions to anywhere you may want to go! Driving was fine if one person is good at navigating. We loved Culebra and managed to take the ferry ourselves. It was super easy. The ferry is a nice hour ride on the water and the cove on Culebra is breath taking. Rio Camuy caves by far everyone's favorite. Amazing. They operate on Puerto Rico time so don't be in a rush. We waited over an hour for the tour to start (10 min they said) and it was worth it. Arciebo Observatory can be done on the way to the caves. It was interesting but the telescope part was a little disappointing. It was not as shiny as one would guess. Overall the visit was worthwhile. Tip. If you have someone that cannot walk up the hill, they will send a car down to get you and save you the hike up and down a bunch of stairs in the heat. Ponce. We drove over to the dry forest. It was interesting to see the contrast to the tropical side. This drive confirmed that we picked the right place to stay! El Yunque. We had a great tour of the rainforest. Ideal is to hike DOWN to the waterfall. Seriously. They tell you to hike up from Big Tree. It is so much easier to hike DOWN from La Mina. Guavate. We wanted to eat roasted pork so we headed here after a morning tour of the Barcardi factory. Yum I'm not even a fan of roasted pig and found the food really good. We went during the week and we can only imagine how crazy all the road stalls would be during the weekend. Barcardi. You get 2 free drink tickets. The prices are not too bad at the factory. The tour.. yeah. take it or leave it. they do teach you about the drinks, how to mix them, the history. But don't be silly and think you actually get to go into the factory. They show you videos. If you are done with the beach and want a change of pace... do the tour. You'll learn something new. Other comments: Loquillo Kiosks are good choices for dinner or a fried snack. They have penny slots in the casino. Join the Wyndham club - on the third night they will provide a welcome wine or beer and snacks. After joining the wyndham club the internet was free but super super slow. You have to pay for it and they will credit the daily charge to the room. Parking. Go for the valet. They are very fast with the car. Yes it is $20.00 for the day... but why pay $15 to self park? Concierge is full of information, details and very helpful. At the base of the street when you turn in to go to the hotel, there is an amazing little pastery shop tucked into the corner next to the chinese restaurant. Iguana's are harder to spot than you think. Go to one of the daily feedings at the front pond. They love their lettuce. Ice Machine... will the ice machine on either side of the 6th floor ever get fixed? Check your bill... make sure all charges are correct. We too had a charge they left on but then they removed it immediately. If you enjoy being away from the action and like a slower pace... hanging out in the part of town where tourists are harder to spot... Stay in Rio Grande!

We rented a car from USave rental car, after checking back a few times we ended up getting an Economy car for $92 for the 5 days. The car was newer, but the inside had stained seats, oh well i only had to drive it for 5 days! Paying for parking in the resort garage for guest really bothered me. Since there is not another business within a mile plus of the place, so the only people using the garage are people either using the casino or hotel guests. Yes, you need to take your parking ticket to get \"validated\" at the bellmans desk just out front the hotel. Your asked to write your name and room number on the back in front of them. Some days they made a note of the name and some they didn't. I say this because everytime i left that desk i changed my name and room number to something that completely does not make sense (changing the letter into competely different letter making a foriegn looking name), so not only would i be billed, neither would another person in another room get billed because the name made no sense. They only made note on there sheet at the Parking desk twice out of the five days. So i was charges for only 2 out of 5 days. Parking is $15 + $1.05 tax a day. The girlfriend and i picked up a styrofoam cooler $3.99 used their ice machine, bought pop ($1) and rum ($13) from the store. We ended up picking up a blender ($15) and margarita mix ($7) from Walmart with a couple insulated mugs ($7) and made are own frozen margaritas in the room. Don't tell Walmart, but we returned the blender when we were done with it, lol. The total cost was about what 2 drinks at the bar would run ($10.13) a piece for a frozen margarita. The rainforest in less than 10 minutes away ok more like 5 minutes if you drive like the locals. Beware the shoulder is a lane in Puerto Rico, and motorcycles will drive down in between the vehicles. We did the Yunke zip line tour which was only 5-10 minutes away for $98 a person, it was awesome. The beach did get trashy at times, but the resort used their beach cleaning machine to clean it almost daily. At times the waves were large but fun to play in. Staff was very pleasant to its guests. Casino was small, but large enough to have fun in. Taking road 66 from the airport was worth the $1.50 toll verse taking 3 all the way across, 66 saves so much time. Ok, i am going to stop typing, lol. Oh one last thing, i would have loved to have golfed, but the prices were to much at the Resort courses, they entire 5 days i did not see one golfer one the courses as we drove in and out of the Resort.

Yes, a must have. The hotel is a way from the airport. It will save you alot of money. A hotel or private tour to the rainforest would have been approx .$ 100.00. We spent $ 9.00. On returning the car I needed to put $14.00 in gas. Our stay was 4 nights. Upon checking in we were given a room immediately and upgraded from Garden View to Ocean View Room 3016. From our balcony we were above adult pool and ocean beyond it. There are tiled floors in the room so use caution. There was a musty smell. We opened the balcony door and put a towel on the floor by the bed. No big deal. As we live in Florida I can understand why there are tile floors. As far as the thermostat, when it got cold at night I would turn up the temperature. The 2 king sized beds were so cozy. The provided toiletries were top notch quality brand. I had coffee every morning and left 1.00 for housekeeping and was stocked with plenty of coffee and Twinings Tea. We arrived to 2 bottles of complimentary water. We first ate at the Tiki Bar and my adult daughter and I were able to share a burger and fries and still be full. Prices are comparable to any city prices. We were joined by an orange young tom-cat that seems to \"live\" on property. We fed him but he was not annoying in any way and happy to go about his business. There are alot of activities at the hotel, no charge. We were there on a weekend. Friday and Saturday nights there is \"Drive In Movie\" night by the pool, rated G and they offer popcorn fresh popped from a cart. There is always something at night in the Ballroom, dancing, music, comedy, etc. We were there for a Mardi Gras costume night anyone could attend. There is a wine bar with live piano music. During the day they offer bingo, water aerobics, dance lessons, etc. Every moring there is feeding the Iguanas time where you can feed them lettuce. The kids club looks great. All activites are posted on a board by the pool and in the lobby. It is a shame that more people don't attend these events. The dealers at the casino were great at helping new players learn the games. If you are a \"seasoned\" player don't expect everyone on your table to know the \"book\". We met some nice people and joined them each evening. The hotel tour desk staff were very accommedating with print out directions to resturants and attractions. The beach was clean, but the water is a bit rough. We had a late departing flight and we were welcomed to leave our bags with valet for no charge and use all the ammenities for the day. We did eat at the resturant down the hill from the hotel to the light and make a right. The host was very cordial and helped us with the menu. And the food was good. We also stopped at the bottom of the hill at the market. It was a Friday night and there was live music and dancing in front. We got some snacks and drinks, the only fruit was bananas though. They were delicious, so much sweeter. We took road trips. One was to El Yuque Rainforest and stopped at the Guest Center first and watched the free movie. Worth it. Drove up to the first waterfall and got out and took some photos. Continued to the observation tower and walked up. Took the trail to the falls you can swim at. We were told 35 min. walk each way but never timed it. Parts of the trail slope steeply up and down. We must have arrived with a tour because the fall was full of people unfortunately very loud with music and picnics in the water. We were at first disappointed. We went under the wooden bridge and used a private pool. After they left we went under the falls. Clear, exhillarating and cold! On the drive back down we ate at the El Yuque outdoor cafe. There we sampled. That was the best food we had. We drove to Luquillo Beach and rented 2 beach lounges for the day at $5.00 each. Skipped the umbrella and sat under the palm trees. Very nice beach. My daughter was serenaded by a cute older gentleman who strolled the beach with a gutiar and sang. I was more than delighted to give him $3.00. Parking for the day is $3.00. There was a gift shop and snack shop. We tried a really good lobster and crab \"taco\". Empanada and taquitos. Beer, water and margarita. Very reasonable. Last outing was San Juan. We had been there before and skipped the fort. Walked around side streets. Then decided to stay near the cruise ship port because there were more shops and activity. There was a Starbucks, for the homesick. We ate at the staple Senor Frog's. Food's not good, but fun atmosphere. Passed a local bakery. Picked up 2 pasteries everything was $1.00 each. Very good.

On recommendations here we rented a car from Thrifty for $20/day and it was a nice car. Just to get 2 and from the resort would have cost us over $100 so this was the way to go and I did not notice any difference in driving from the states. Parking is also $15/day but since we used the car to drive everywhere it really paid for itself. Upon arrival I had an easy check-in and requested a room on a higher floor with an ocean view and there was no hesitation to change my room. We booked Cheap Caribbean and part of the deal was a $100 Visa gift card from the dept of tourism. The Rio Mar did not have any on hand but had no trouble giving us a $100 credit instead and showed on the closing bill without any problems as some other posters mentioned. The room was very nice and the bed very comfortable, better than most resorts I have stayed at in the Caribbean. Be warned that food and drink is expensive at the resort so if you have a car drive to the Amigo market which is the 3rd light (193 right) East of the resort on RT 3 in Luquillo (5 min drive). Driving there you pass the Kioskos on the left just past the 2nd light and I would recommend going to La Parilla #2, The Burger Shack #12 or The Lighthouse #20. All have excellent food and inexpensive except La Parilla but still half the price as the Rio Mar. By a cooler at Amigo and stock it with drinks; we also bought some lunch meat and cheese for quick lunches on the go and didn't feel the need to rent the fridge which is $10/day. All staff members encountered where very friendly and very helpful. The grounds were well kept and the beach very clean. The pools were nice and water warm and the chairs at the adult pool were cushioned. The only complaint is the pool collected debris during the day and was not cleaned so the afternoons there were some floating things. The casino is nice and we actually won, the gym is small but free and parking was not as far as some reviews made it out to be. Since we never ate at the resort we ate out at most of the places that were recommended in previous reviews and all were good. I mentioned the Kioskos area above, El Jefe Burger Shack is all hand made from their own ground chuck and the guys at the Lighthouse made me 3 different types of Mofungo not on the menu to try and was it good. I also ate at the Brass Cactus in Luquillo (193 left) then another left at the split and down 4 blocks (park on the street) This was great for all kinds of food including for kids. One afternoon we drove into Old San Juan (not a lot of traffic considering it was 4 pm) and had dinner at Old Harbor Brewery, Steak & Seafood. They make their own beer and I tried several and their food was excellent. Dinner for 2 was only $75 with tip so not too bad. We ate breakfast almost every morning at Ismala Bakery which is located at rt 3 and rt 968 where you turn to go up the hill to the Rio Mar. Since you are so close to El Yunque it is a must that you go and at least drive through if not take the trails. I took the Big Tree trail at KM 10 which leads to La Mina Falls and hike the La Mina trail out to the Palo Colorado Info Center at KM11.7. We also took the ferry out of Fajardo to Culebra Island ($5 round trip) and went to Flamenco Beach ($5 round trip with the Willy buses). Very beautiful and they just finished adding Kioskos for food and drink and prices are very reasonable so I would highly recommend it. If you are bringing a cooler just make sure no glass items, only cans. There is surfing in PR besides Rincon the West Coast and it's right in Luquillo. Go see Juan at the Luquillo Surf Shop and he will set you up. A little tough to find, just turn left on 193 off rt 3 then right at the split and follow to the town square. Since the square is all 1 way go right first the 2 lefts and take a quick jog right at the hardware store then left and the coast will be in front of you. Go to the end and turn left then park and the surf shop is across the street which also will soon be a restaurant and bar. That about wraps it up and I hope you find this helpful.

It is 15 mins from Fajardo where Bio bay kayak tours originate and ferry to Vieques and Culebra originates. The pool is really good and they have iguanas roam around freely on the resort. They have a night fire going on by the pool and pools are 24 hours. Water sports is outsourced but they'll have someone by the beach. The beach is really good outside the resort. We ran into a number of problems though. 1. Shower pressure - it literally stops while you are all soaped up. Then super cold then super hot. All randomly. 2. Elevator to self park wasn't working..so had to carry bags through stairs. 3. They dont have a person to validate your parking outside of self park, so you have to go outside the main entrance and then to the garage..and its $15/day. 4. No Nightly Entertainment. 5. Internet in the common computers area is slower than dial up. 6. Restaurants aren't that good except for Palio and the Bakery food really sucks. 7. The bar in the center serves really good snacks like Paninis. Order from the bar..and their drinks are good too. 8. Service is ok. People aren't that friendly. 9. Resort is more like a hotel, you pay, we give you the pool and the beach access and you go and enjoy yourself. We aren't involved in anyway. 10. If you get an ocean view..make sure its floors 5 or higher or the trees would block your view. 11. Make sure to sign up for Wyndham By Request online before your get there to get free internet and if your reservation is through a third party site like Expedia, you don't get any Wyndham reward points or Wyndham By Request free internet access. 12. Bathrooms are dirty, we found two hairs..which were definitely not ours and housekeeping doesn't clean the bathroom include toilet bowls every day. We also stayed at Gran Melia for a day..and trust me Gran Melia is much better in appearance, service and their Wet Bar has awesome drinks to go along with their beautiful pool.

Here is my review: Hotel is very pretty. The grounds are kept very clean.The first night there we ate at the casual rest. in front of the waterfall (can't remember name)- I had the pasta bar. It was amazing- the chef cooked everything right in front of you. Yes, it was a little pricey (4 adults= $81). The waves on the beach were beautiful to watch and it was fun to body surf, but yes it was a little rough. I would not have let young children go out very far. The best part about the beach was the thousands (yes I am telling the truth) of sand dollars in the water. They are everywhere! The drinks were definitely expensive, so we went to the local Wal Mart (like everyone else), bought a cooler, stocked up on beer and wine coolers and snacks, and spent our money on evening meals. Definitely rent a car!!! It's a must. There were a total of 4 adults in my party. We rented through Enterprise (on line) and got the \"standard\" car for $134 for a week. We ended up only putting $10 of gas in it the whole week and we drove the entire island. So, instead of having to book excursions with the hotel or travel company we were able to tour the El Yunque Rainforest for a total of $9, go to the Arecebo Observatory for $12, and the Camuy Caves for $24. All of those trips can be booked thorough the hotel for well over $100 per person. And the best part was that we were able to take our time if we wanted. Now, for places to eat: We ate at Richie's one night. Very good food, but very expensive. 4 adults, 4 meals, 2 waters, and 2 margaritas totaled $160 (they add the tip to the bill). The next night we ate at the Hacienda. The BEST food on the island! Again, 4 adults, 4 meals, 2 teas, 4 margaritas totaled $120, including the tip. The best part was that both places will come pick you up at the hotel and bring you back so you don't have to search after dark for their places. Then one night we went down the hill to Don Pepe's. Small place, nice people, very good food! 2 people really can share a meal there is so much food. Again, 4 people, 4 meals, 6 margaritas totaled $100 including the tip. The Kioskos in Loquilla were neat. Eat it fresh if possible. We ate chicken Pinchos (shish-ka-bobs) right off the grill and they were great. That night all 4 of us had rice, beans, Pinchos, sodas for about $20 total. Visited Old San Juan for the day. Find a place to park for the day and ride the trolley. We parked at the Normandy hotel parking, took the bus to Old San Juan and rode the free trolley all day. Parking at the Normandy was $4. The streets are extremely tight and you are asking for a wreck if you attempt to drive those tiny streets. Was able to get off the trolley at El Morro and tour on our own for about $6. We went diving in Fajardo and in San Juan. Not as clear as Cancun or Cozumel, Mexico but a neat experience. Overall, the trip was a great one. Stay positive and friendly and you are not likely to encounter negativity. A smile and a thank you went a long way for us every single day. We will definitely be returning to see everything we missed on this trip (Culebra, Visquez, Agadilla, bio bay, Ponce, and more diving).", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paramus, NJ", "Title": "\u201cThumbs Down!\u201d", "Author": "westva", "ReviewID": "UR46476289", "Content": "Upon entering my room for the first time I found a live ROACH who crawled out from under the phone and beside the bed were empty peanut shells which took the maid 5 days to discover.

The first day was fine as our group was happy to be in the warm sun of PR. But as the week progressed I noticed some problems that would prevent me from returning. My bathroom had no ceramic items in it that were not damaged. The sink had a large starburst crack of about 8 inches that looked like someone had thrown a bowling ball in it- not possible to miss. The bathtub had 5 large areas of damage that had a rough repair on it- the repair looked like spackle and had the same rough surface. The bathroom floors were dirty, and the tub had mildew on the grout. The caulk between the tub and wall was falling out (Exterior walls of the hotel had green mold on them- also not possible to miss). The bedroom was OK- but had major issues with the cooling system. Alaska or Haiti, nothing in-between. Out to the tiki bar. Again- first day was fine. Drink (beer in my case) prices were reasonable. Return the next day.... more than double the price. When I asked why- \"they made a mistake\". All day, 3 bartenders?? That was the last drink we bought there, they lost a ton. On closer look the area around the bar wasn't very clean; I wore flip-flops after the first day even though it was directly adjacent to the pool and beach. Only order food at the outdoor pool if you are related to a dentist; dry and tasteless. Wear boots if you go into the bathroom adjacent to the pool- standing water on the floors, mold on ceilings and walls. The pools themselves were very nice- I would say the high-point of the resort. Service here, again, left a lot to be desired. Indoor restaurants weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much better. The food at Palio was good, the Ossobuco was really good. Service was OK.... nothing to write home about. The food at Shimas (Sushi/Asian) was very good- too bad they closed it down for the last night I was there. When I asked the front desk manager why she told me it was due to the \"mass checkout\". I guess they didn't expect all those people to leave when they said they would. I was then informed the \"grill\" was also closed for the same reason- our option was Marbella. Way too few servers, and they were all completely overwhelmed. After 3 hours to get our meal the restaurant manager began an argument with our table over the bill. She offered to comp us, and then changed her mind. Not the model of professionalism. Back up to the front desk manager... situation resolved. At least we had live entertainment- we watched every other table in the restaurant get up and leave without being served, throwing a few shots at the manager on the way out. When you go for the breakfast buffet bring a straw if you want scrambled eggs-they must be from a box. The golf course was nice- the food there was also not to a very high standard. Overall, this facility needs to have some serious attention paid to it. It does have a fantastic location and could be great, but the lack of maintenance and professionalism from staff brings it to a 1 star in my book. If going make sure there is a place to eat- I asked the manager what they do when occupancy is low- they send you off-site in a shuttle.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nc", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST\u201d", "Author": "myopinoncounts", "ReviewID": "UR46379252", "Content": "This hotel was great for the entire family!

At first glance it looks really pretty, but it has to because there is nothing for you to do. When we got there they didn't have the room we reserved so we had to wait till the next day to get it (no compensation for this either!) Thank goodness because the room we were in was about 40 degrees even thought the thermostat was set for 80. The safe was locked and the floor was filthy. We tried to call to the front desk but the phone didn't work! We were told someone would look at it right away. Never happened! Dinner...$150 for the two of us and it was just OK. I do not mind paying that much for a nice dinner, but had it not been for the company I am sure we would have been much more disappointed. Poolside....depending on who brought you your drink the prices fluctuated. We were there with 500 people and everyone had the same complaint. $8 from one guy $10 from another I got socked with an $11!!! DO NOT eat the food at the BBQ hut! Totally dried out hockey puck for a burger and $13. That includes nothing. No fries, chips, nothing! Beach....brown dirt-like \"sand\" your feet are actually dirty from walking on it. We stayed at the pool. Rooms....I would say half of the people were complaing that mid-way through your shower....drip drip drip. It would just stop. There you are full of soap and no water! And about a third of the peoople were complaining that the room was either too hot even thought the thermostat was set at 50 and the rest wre complaining it was freezing no matter how high you set the thermostat. That was our problem in two different rooms. And when we opened the door to let some warmer air in, it was just humidity that came in. Our room was soaked when we got back from dinner!!!!! Casino....the reason this resort was chosen was because of it's on-site casino. If you want to call it that. 1 roulette wheel, 3 blackjack tables 2 3-card poker tables NO craps and even though the blackjack tabes were 3 deep waiting to sit, they would not open another table. Even thought there was an extra dealer \"hanging out\" just talking int the \"pit\" and we repeatedly asked ot open a table. I must say I did thank the pit boss at the end of the trip because he saved me probably a TON of money! Dinner buffet was a joke...an expensive on at that! AND WATCH YOUR BILL!!!!! one of our friends got a muffin at the little muffiin place and mixed in her charges was a charge for $66. Even for this place that is high!!! She went to the desk and they took $100 off her bill which to me ays they knew they were wrong and just wanted to move her along and hope she wouldn't tip tooo many people off to their scam. We were warned by someone on our tour (not from the hotel) to \"watch your bill at that place\" I tend to think this happens a lot. I will say that the staff for the most part was friendly, but then they should be because we were talking to one waitress who told us that theweek before they were so dead that most of them weren't even working! If you go, no matter where you stay.....take the tour of Bio Bay kyacking. It was the absolute highlight of the trip. You are in a lagoon that lights up whenever you touch the water! Totally something to see! All in all, I could not recomend this place to anyone, and beware...if the price is right, there is probably a reason for it!!!

Cons: Ridiculous drink and food prices. (Two small Pina Coladas and a disgusting raw hamburger $39 with tip). Onsite tour/travel agency a big rip off. Casino very small. Beach chocolate brown paste and rough surf. Also, you get kicked off the beach at 4:30pm because of migrating sea turtles. I'm all about respecting the sea turtles, however, the staff grade the beach the next morning so any sea turtle eggs would probably be destroyed. Very little to do at this resort other than lay by the pool and be harassed by the pool manager. Pool manager stalks the guests and if you have a cooler you have to remove it. However, if you rent their $75 Cabana, they provide you with one of their coolers. Or you can buy their overpriced paper buckets of beer or drinks, but just don't try to bring your own can \"Beer\". If you don't order from the waiters around the pool you will be stalked to make sure you aren't carrying any alcoholic contraband. The pool manager was rude and very unprofessional. We've never encountered this at any other resort we've stayed at. Overall, we did not find this resort to be a good value. The pool drinks/food scam was too much of a ripoff for us.

There are 2 places to eat that I know of that will come pick you up from the hotel and drive you back after you eat. We heard Richie's was expensive with just ok food. We ate at the other place and it was good. Dinner for 2 with drinks was about $30.00, compared to at least $60.00 at the hotel.

Next time, we would stay in San Juan, or better yet, Vieques.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MN", "Title": "\u201cNice grounds, far from everything...\u201d", "Author": "sharebear1234", "ReviewID": "UR45433219", "Content": "This resort is really pretty. Nestled on the beach right across from the rain forest, you are surrounded by vegatation and amazing mountain/ocean views. The hotel itself was nice and the rooms were comfortable and clean. The lobby of the hotel is also beautiful and very \"tropical\".The only complaints I would have would be for more entertainment and things to do at night. You are pretty far from the city of San Juan, so unless you rent a car, you are pretty much stuck on the grounds for your stay. Car rental is cheap, but the trip to get up to the city is about 30 min, and you cant exactly get lost on this island because it really isnt safe in some areas....especially at night. You have to know where you are going. We would have loved to have seen more nightly \"action\" on the resort. Maybe a \"Puerto Rican\" Luau on the beach one night....or a comedian show in one of the lounges, or some sort of a night club or salsa band? Their is a casino..but if you dont gamble... its not really exciting. I would have just liked to see more things to do at night. We got kinda bored after dinner. During the day you have a lot of options...pool, beach, boogie board, rain forest tours, snorkeling, golf...etc...but at night I feel the resort lacks \"pizazz\"... And the only other complaint I have is the price of things on the resort. Be prepared to spend. The drinks are $8-12 dollars each plus tip, and the main restaurant is very exspensive. Entree's are $20-40 dollars each. The breakfast buffet in the morning is huge....but VERY exspensive as well... $30 bucks a person!!!!!!! FOR BREAKFAST!! We were also charged quite a large resort fee at the end of the stay...which tacked on another 200 bucks at the end of our stay. Beautiful grounds, nice workers and people, just pricey. Also, if your looking for privacy and a secluded resort far from the hustle and bustle of San Juan...this place has it!", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLooking forward to returning\u201d", "Author": "Fresca1", "ReviewID": "UR44027189", "Content": "Stay was from 9/17 to 9/21.

We just got back today from a week long stay there today and would definited go back. The beach was beautiful. The only trash on the beach we saw was further down in Luquillo. The water is a bit rough but still ok to take a dip in. If you don't want to swim in the ocean there are two swimming pools. Both pools were clean and since school is in session very few children were using them. Like so many other's who have posted we rented a car at the airport. Believe me, you will not regret doing that. You will have to pay 15.00 per day to park but it's worth it. I really didn't like the way they handle validating the parking ticket. You have to go to the valet parking area, have your ticket stamped, then have your car out of the garage within 15 minutes. If your car isn't out of the garage within 15 minutes you have to go right back up there and have your ticket validated a second time. Whew, that's a lot of trouble. Ok, back to the budget, to keep from spending so much on food we drove to Amigos grocery store and bought snacks. There's an Amigos in both directions approximately 5 to 10 minutes away. We were going to rent a refrigerator but were told that the price to rent one is now, get this, 10.00 per day. They've went up from 25.00 to the 10.00 per day fee. So, if you're on a budget like we were, just get a cooler. There's also fast food close by like Subway, Burger King, and KFC. Driving around San Juan is an experience in itself because drivers there are more aggressive than they are in the states. Hotel staff, however, will give you very good directions to get to wherever you want to go. Just ask, be brave, and hit the road. Take the same tours they offer but do it yourself. They're very helpful with directions. Since we seldom drink, we only purchased two drinks during happy hour. Happy Hour is between 6 and 9:00 PM. See Eli at the lobby bar during happy hour for a drink called \"Happy Monkey\". I'm unsure what's in it but I can tell you that Eli will not skimp on the rum. Be prepared for the hotel to put a \"hold\" on your credit of debit card. We weren't aware of this before we went and this may cause you problems if you aren't prepared for it. The hold is 400.00 but they lowered ours to 200.00 and said they'd call us if they saw we were getting close to our limit. When we checked out the only thing we owed was our parking. It would be my guess that not too many people can say that. Another IMPORTANT thing...if having a ocean view room is beyond your budget, go on-line and join Wyndam By-Request. I did so and they up-graded our room to ocean view. I think besides renting the car that was the one thing that made our stay even better and joining is, can I hear you say, \"free\"? It's free. Because I joined Wyndam By-Request, we were given a room overlooking the ocean and pool, but only had to pay for a mountain view room. Remember sometimes the best things in life are free. You can catch some beautiful sunsets at the Rio Mar. I missed some good pictures 'cause I didn't have my camera with me so make sure you do at sunset. About the cabana's, we were able to use a cabana overlooking the ocean in the shade. No one said anything to us about paying for it even though I had read posts that there was a charge to rent them. Overall, I loved the place, and would give it a five star rating. Staff was helpful, room, beach, pools, ground were clean, view was beautiful, and we had a wonderful time even traveling on our tight budget.

The resort is about 40 minutes east of San Juan. The ride is quick and very nice. The hotel is more of an old world tuscan feel then a Caribbean...gorgeous....tile, stone, black iron, and dark hardwoods. The the interior around the lobby, restaurants, and grounds are stunning. Check in was somewhat quick and the staff were all very nice and helpful. Our room overlooked the pool and ocean and was very nice...tile floors, dark wood, stone counters, flat screen TV, internet in room, huge rooms with high ceilings, and radio with mp3 hookups. The pool area is divided into two areas...one for families and one for adults. The childrens side has a water slide, playground, and young child area. The adult side waterfalls, hot tubs, etc. The pool areas are VERY clean and well kept...The beach is basically palm lined, copper color, and clear water. The surf is heavier here but the water is still clear and suitable for body surfing and children...but keep an eye on them. Be cautious of some undertoe...also sometimes a bee or two on the beach. The hotel provides beach chairs, umbrellas, and towels. You can also rent poolside or beachfront cabanas for the day. The concierge desk was helpful and can arrange all your tours and dinners for you. The hotel has numerous restaurants on site, coffee bar, tiki bar, casino, and gym. Old san juan...about 45 minutes away....el yunke...maybe 20. For dinner...their intalian restaurant was VERY nice. (more refined and dress up)..ritchies is also great..local food and a stunning view. Hacienda Carabole is our favorite of the trip though ....free shuttle service to the restaurant (5 minutes away)...more rustic on farm...don't get dressed up for here or expect a 5 star restaurant...but if you want an amazing meal prepared in local style...THIS IS THE PLACE....and one of the best steaks I have ever had (churasco flank)...they also offer rain forest horseback rides and atv trips....The hotels coffee bar has great coffees and their buffet breakfast is great..with omlette service and all. The resort has everything and I will visit again...probably this year. The hotel is very well kept and clean...not looking worn at all.....looks almost new. Now the bad....some trash one beach....not bad or a lot by any means...but you may notice cigarette buts and a few empty cups laying around. Hotel could fix this easy by just sending an employee out once a day for 15 minutes. Prices are VERY HIGH for food and drinks. I've been to a lot of resorts and these prices are quite a bit higher...$8 for a corona and $11 mixed drinks....dinners can easily run you $100 plus and lunches in the $50-$60 range....even a breakfast (all you can eat) wil be an easy $50. That said the food is very high quality and you do get what you pay for. Best thing you can do is pay for the taxi ride to wallmart (10 minutes away - $40 or so...and they wait for you).....grab a foam cooler, your supplies, drink cups, lotion, a case of beer, bottle opener, snacks, breakfast bars, case of water, and a few bottles of rum and a gallon of guava juice (guava juice and coconut rum is amazing....also...predone mojitos over ice are great)....that will set you for the week and you will probably save $200-$400 in drinks and snacks for the week. Get your suntan lotion there as well...hotel charges like $25 for it......$6 at walmart....if I were this hotel the only thing I would do is lower the food and drink prices....maybe 20%....$6 beers and $8 mixed drinks would be fine with me....drop menu prices maybe 10%. Also, I'd send someone out to the beach twice a day just to do a quick clean up or trash. Other then this it was a GREAT resort....and evrythign was very, very nice. I will go back again, very soon!

I read many, many of the reviews here and I have to say that everything is relative. Whether you love this place depends on your background and travel experience. This is our 3rd time to the Caribbean; the first time in Puerto Rico. The grounds, lobby, and restaurants of the Rio Mar are beautiful. The valet that greeted us gave us a brief orientation of where everything was in the resort and offered helpful tips such as be sure get to the towel hut before 6:00 p.m. for towels. (They allow you to take towels offsite for snorkeling or the rainforest as long as you return them). Yes, the hallways and some furniture are showing some wear, but our oceanfront room was immaculately cleaned with no plumbing problems. Beds are comfortable. Our room was quiet. The resort was responsive to previous complaints about iguanas and their poop near the pool; the iguanas have since been relocated to a fresh water pond behind the resort. We saw only 2 iguanas near the pool during our stay. They are harmless and fun to watch. The beach is pretty. Although the sand is brown, its grain is fine and the water, while a bit murky, is warm. Compared to the beaches in the mid-Atlantic U.S. region, it is a treat! I agree with the other reviewer that the beach isn't cleared of trash often enough. The nearby Tiki Hut provides drinks and snacks, so plastic cups and containers get left behind by careless guests. This resort is an environmental nightmare with the plastic, bottles, and cans it churns out. I did not see any visible signs of recycling. Yes, restaurants, bars, and incidentals are expensive. We ate at Marabellas twice. They fully explained the pricing of the buffets to us. Great variety! We purchased breakfast and snack foods at the local Amigo market and stored them in portable coolers to avoid the $25 refrigerator fee. There are plenty of restaurants within a 10-min drive that offer authentic PR food at reasonable prices. We enjoyed exploring and many places offered a kids menu with familiar items like chicken nuggets and mac and cheese. We loved the mofongo at Don Pepes. One thing that was a pleasant surprise was that the resort offers activities all day long. If you're not into golf or tennis, you can participate in things like aqua aerobics, dive-in movies, Spanish lessons, Latin dancing, iguana feedings, bingo, and island braiding. They have an Iguana Kids Club, where they offer \"camps\" for the kids for full or half days, leaving you to relax or take advantage of the spa. With two kids, the Kid Club was too costly for us though ($75/child). The concierge staff was extremely knowledgeable and provided us with driving directions and suggestions on fun things to do. All the tours they offer can be sought on your own at MUCH cheaper prices, so that's what we did. We are mildly adventurous and had no problem finding our way around the island and found that most people spoke English. El Yunque was fabulous and cost us only $6. Old San Juan is a real treat. Yes, it is a 45-min ride, but a pleasant one on the Rt. 66 highway, where you get to see more of the island. Loquillo Beach is 20 min. away and you can take a ferry to Culebra or Vieques for world-class beaches, the Bio Bay, and snorkeling. There are only a few resorts in the Rio Grande and Fajardo area, and the Rio Mar is one of the nicer ones. Keep in mind that the general economy in PR is poor, and it is reflected in the community. Almost all the houses we saw are shabby stucco, all with barred windows and porches. Abandoned cars are everywhere. But we found that the people of Puerto Rico are so friendly, welcoming, and proud of their rich heritage. Their history, art, food, and music are incredible. In closing, the Rio Mar is a great place to stay for the area. Had this resort been in the Bahamas or somewhere on the mainland, I would say that it's not a great value. But this is Puerto Rico. While we were there, the staff was extremely accommodating. The housekeeping was very good and unobtrusive. The location is nicely tucked away. You are not stranded.

That being said, I was amazed to see the same trash on the beach day after day. We stayed at the resort Wednesday - Monday and not once did we see any staff cleaning up the beach. As for the pool - the adult pool is very small. It was cloudy the entire time we were there. We saw a pool maintenance person only once, and all he did was scoop a few pieces of floating debris. There was actually a glob of white foamy \"stuff\" floating in the pool for at least 3 days. It looked like maybe drink had been spilled in the pool - at least I hope that's what it was! Very gross.

No one mentioned that several restaurants were closed for the season, no one explained the ridiculous procedure you have to go through with the self parking / ticket validation. It shouldn't be so complicated. We had a rental car, we were staying for 5 days, just charge us for 5 days of registered guest parking - duh! And the signs - some say parking is $15 per day, some signs say $20, some say valet is $20, others say valet is $25! When we checked in, they didn't even tell us how or where to self park, so the valet just parked it with no explanation. After leaving the resort for dinner that first evening, we came back and parked in the self park garage, but the still charged us for 2 days of valet parking.

We read the reviews just like everyone else and thought not bad lets try it. I would never come back here again. Our first room the temperature wouldn't go below 77 degrees. With the humidity in PR this was not reasonable. We also got unpacked and gave our children popcorn well within 10 minutes ants were all over 1 piece of popcorn. The room they gave us was supposed to be a rainforest view and we were looking at an emergency door and a air conditioning vent. After having a tech come out to fix the temperature and fumugate the room for the ant infestation. We ended up complaining again and they gave us a new room. Much better this time with the beach view. The straw that broke the back was the very last night of our stay. We left the room at 10:30 am and came back at 1pm the room had not been cleaned. We left again to go swimming and came back at 4pm and the room still had not been cleaned. I told them we had no clean towels. We called and complained and they said that the next staff of housekeeping would come in at 5:30pm and would clean it first thing, priority they said. yeah right! Went to dinner at the resort came back at 8pm with a sick child that needed to go to bed right away. NO BED! Called down to the front desk demanded that a manager call back and send housekeeping right away. Housekeeping came in 15 minutes and I helped the housekeeping woman to make both double beds for my kids who were exhausted. One of my kids had a 103 temp on Motrin with no where to sleep and had to be moved twice once the beds got done. I'm not above making a bed but come on! Is it my job to go behind their staff to make sure what they said would be done???? Never got a call or an apology from the manager at this resort.

If you are visiting San Juan and you want to do more than lay around the beach and relax, then this resort is not the place to spend your vacation. It is a very beautiful resort in the middle of nowhere. The food choices for vegetarians were simply awful and nonexistent. The staff however were very accommodating. The hotel had several different restaurants, all of which were overpriced. Each dining experience at the resort involved consultation with the staff and modifications of meals, and still the meal wound up not being very enjoyable. You would think that in 2009 that a resort the size of the Wyndham Resort, and its worldwide reputation would make an attempt to accommodate all guest. Not so. The menu had lots of options for those who ate fish, beef, or chicken. But not even a vegeburger with fries, or pasta with stir fry vegetables was available. The Wyndham with its limited food selections has missed an ever growing portion of the vacationing public. The menu stated that the chickens and cows were fed a vegetarian diet. What about a vegetarian diet for guest of the resort? What about a chef to create a menu that would appeal to vegetarians? Is that to much to ask? The other criticism of the Wyndham location had to do with the out of the way location to vacationers who wanted to see or do anything in Puerto Rico, other than lay around the beach. Old San Juan is again 45 minutes away. A cab ride is $80 one way. A tour to Old San Juan is $55.00 per person. It is a must to rent a car to see and experience the island, and get an opportunity to truly experience the island.

Taxis are expensive and you are going to need to one every time you want to go outside of the resort if you don't have a car. From the airport to the hotel is about a 45 minutes ride. And going to San Juan from the hotel is over an hour. El Yunque is near by and it's free and you can drive in on your own. The tours are expensive and especially so if you have young kids as they are being charged the same price. The hotel charges $15 for parking (every time you leave the site I think). The hotel has an airport shuttle but charges $75 per person roundtrip I think. I paid less than $150 for a weekly car rental (we needed for only 4 days). El Yunque was a nice day trip but down to El Mina Falls was a bit of a hike - not too difficult but a good 45 minutes on narrow rocky hill side roads. Only 2 (out of 5) resort restaurants were open when we were there in June (low season)- 1 of which were formal and expensive rmal and was not a good fit as we have 2 toddlers. The buffet dinners at Marcello restaurant ($15 weeknights and more on weekends) were great for us as young kids are free. We ended up eating there every night. There weren't alot of options outside and nearby. Antojitos Puertorrique\u00c3\u00b1os right outside of the main road coming into the resort serves good Puerto Rican food (lunch about $20 per person). The few other restaurant on the main road looked like a hole in the wall and they close early (6pm I think). The hotel rooms, pool and beach are all nice. Services are fine. We spent 4 nights at the resort which was just right. Any longer I would be bored. Day 1 arrival, day 2 El Yunque, day 3 San Juan, Day 4 mostly hung out on resort pool and beach.

Picked up a rental car at Alamo at the airport upon arrival. I would highly recommend the service and pricing we received at Alamo. We were in rush-hour traffic leaving the airport so the trip to the resort took close to 60 minutes. Fine highway driving to the resort. Resort is very easy to find off of Route 3. One thing I find with other Rio Mar reviews that bothers me is the fact that other guests complain about the distance the hotel is from San Juan and then don't rent a car. When you see that the average one-way fare to the Rio Mar from the airport is around $70.00, it just seems that it would be much more advantageous than depending on costly cabs or as others state \"being stranded at the hotel\". Upon arrival at the hotel, check-in was done in a smooth manner. We had booked an oceanview room. Upon arriving at the room, we felt that this room was not quite the one we really expected due to a lack of the oceanview. We then met, in our opinion, probably one of Wyndham's BEST worldwide employees, that being Zandra who is Head of Guest Services. After a wonderful conversion with Zandra (who by the way is from the Rio Grande area and SO knowledgable), she re-assigned us to Ocean Suite 5046. Upon arrival in that room.....WOW....great accomodations, terrific view of the ocean, bathroom amenities galore.......just a great room! We did rent a refrigerator for the room. This is a great way to keep extra beverages, fruit, cheese, etc. for snacking. After unpacking, etc., it was time to tour the hotel. MAGNIFICENT GROUNDS, beautifully kept pools (both activity and adults only pool) and yes many \"observant iguanas\"! Absolutely nothing to be afraid of. In our next 10 days at the Rio Mar, we discovered fine dining abounds there at especially three restaurants that we dined at: Palio, Shimas, and Marbella. Very different menues among all three restaurants. Please realize that this is a resort and and resort prices are charged. To be honest, we ate breakfast every morning in the suite on the balcony with food we puchased at Amigo Market (approx. 3 miles away Rte. 3, Wal-Mart about 8 miles away on Rte. 3 in Fajardo), as well as the Ishmar Bakery and Palmer Bakery, both within a 5-7 minute ride from the resort. EXCELLENT baked goods at both bakeries. When dining out of the resort, DO NOT MISS THE KIOSKS in Loquillo. Some people really turn their noses up when they see this area...DON' T BE FOOLED!!! We dined there for 4 evenings....La Parilla (#2)....Osso Bucco (#29).....and twice at El Jefe Burger Shack (#12). Great prices, great variety, and the best service. If you go to El Jefe, please tell Tim, the owner, that Don and John from Westwood, MA say \"hello\". Also sign his autograph wall...we did!!!!! Another fine restaurant very close to the resort is Dom Pepe serving delicious Puerto Rican/Mexican cuisine...we had some of both. Liquor, beer and wine are easily bought at Amigo and Wal-mart...great prices. Pick up some mixers to complement your selections and stash them in your fridge. Beverages at the resort can run from $6.00 to $10.00 and can certainly \"pack a punch\"!!! Don't miss happy hour poolside at the Tiki Bar from 5-7pm...certain drinks are 2 for 1. The casino is decorated lovely...great selection of machines as well as tables....and it's NON SMOKING! Such an enjoyment not to inhale second-hand smoke. The casino staff was very friendly every night while serving complimentary beverages and snacks. Very clean casino....just like the entire resort. The ERL Cafe, beside the casino, open early to late, serves some great wraps and other goodies. Coffeemakers are available in your room with the most delicious packets of Puerto Rican coffee. Pick up some half and half at the store and keep it in your room. We did hear people rave about the breakfast buffet served at Marbella, but it's a bit too much food to start our mornings. And yes.....the beach has brown sand. I guess that bothers some people. We spent 9 terrific days on that beach in the most beautiful ocean water (great waves), sitting on nice lounges on the brown sand. Beach crew is very accomodating when you need a lounge or umbrella. Hung out only at adult pool once during stay (we really love the beach). I really appreciate the fact that the adult pool is what it says it is...we did see children niceley escorted back to the family pool. Don't miss out on a fun daily activity...iguana feeding. Meet at the towel booth at about 10:45AM and then be guided to where all the iguanas hang out. You feed them lettuce (that's a treat for them). Don't forget the camera!!!! Oh by the way, they do not have teeth but razor-sharp tongues. You'll catch on to their habits real fast. Great for kids. Please, as being so close in proximity, spend at least half-a-day at El Yunque Rain Forest. Stop at the visitors' center...$3.00 admission...take a short tour...don't miss the 17-minute film on the history of El Yunque....it is fascinating. Then decide if you want to walk up to the rain forest or drive. Being limited that last afternoon on time, we drove. Thoroughly enjoyed all the sights. Climbed a tower, some great vegetation (bamboo, etc) and great waterfalls. Don't miss it! On an overcast day, we journeyed to Old San Juan for a few hours. Great buys on jewelry, artwork, gifts, etc. Great historical viewings also (San Juan Fort, San Juan Cathedral oh and Pigeon Park......you gotta check that one out!!!!!) I cannot say enough about the staff at The Rio Mar...namely Bianca and Yalitze at the concierge desk, Rebekah and Ana from Marbella and Shimas and all so so many more that really made us feel \"important\" in this hustling world of travel as \"true guests\". I hope if you travel to the Rio Mar, you meet these people we've mentioned and especially Zandra who just seems to be the greatest \"team leader at this Wyndham or any other in the world\". We are planning a return trip to the Rio Mar in January, 2010. Already booked our flights and car....great rates are available ....so check them out. This is one destination, not only area but resort,,,,that will make you want to come back for more. Hope we didn't go on too much, but this place deserves every recommendation it good be given. P.S. On certain evenings in the lobby beside the casino, certain vendors from the Rio Grande area exhibit beautiful crafts and artwork. Please look for Artesano Vincent Huertas and his breath-taking artwork which is quite affordable.

We were completely wrong. On the weekends this hotel seems to turn into a getaway for the locals. It seems as if the parents come and gamble and just let the kids entertain themselves by whatever means possible. To the tune of running up and down the hallways yelling and singing and banging on room doors before jumping on elevators. It took the hotel 2 hours to deal with this issue. When I went down to the front desk there were teenagers everywhere. It was like an amusement park. This was my only major complaint with the hotel. They seem to turn a blind eye to behavior you dont anticipate seeing in a resort lobby. The minor stuff... When we walked in to our room the maintanence guy was there fixing the AC. As soon as he left, it stopped working. We went and told the front desk and they relocated us, no questions asked. However, the room they gave us was occupied, which we awkwardly discovered after opening the door to the room. After going back down to the front desk the put is in a room I would call a junior suite, which was nice. A little bigger t han a standard room and had a fullsize coucher and a bigger bathroom. Over all the Front desk staff was very helpful. The room was clean and was as expected for a Wyndham reseort. However at certain times of day you would completely lose water and when it came back it would be brown sludge for the first minute or so. Also the cleaning staff never came until about 6pm. Made it kind of a pain to come back from being out all day to clean up for dinner and have the room just start being cleaned. The restauraunts, Palio and The Grill Room were nice. A bit pricey but the food was good as well as the service. The tour desk is useless unles you want to pay rediculous amounts of money for excursions you can book yourself. Get a rental car if you stay at this hotel. Also do the valet. Its $5 more a day and no hassles. We booked a helmet diving tour with them only to find out late that he booked us a regular snuba tour. Not what we wanted and we were very clear that we did not want a snuba tour, only the hemlet diving. He lied flat out to us just to book the tour. Then tried to give us a hard time about canceling when we verified with the tour guide (who was super nice about everything). The Casino is a waste of time. On saturday night they had 1 blackjack table open with about 30 people standing around wanting to play. Same deal with roulette. Open another table already. The slots were decent for a small table but that was the only thing you could really play. Overall I have to give the hotel average at best.

The beach is wonderful! Mostly clean (when guests would pick up their trash!) and spaceous, the beach was a great morning activity. The constant breeze blowing in kept the heat and humidity at bay, creating a very relaxing soak in the sun.

The Tiki Bar attendants would pass by occasionally giving you an opportunity to partake in a cool beverage.

If you get a $100 debit card cash it at the casino instead of the ATM. 9. Use the beach as often as possible because pools are nasty and crowded. 10. Seek a tour that is cheaper than ones offered by the hotel. Overall we had a great time and we are looking forward to our next vacation now that we know the tricks of the trade.

The grocery stores are very nice and we purchased sandwich stuff, snacks and bererages to help keep our expenses down. Because the resort is directly on the beach, it makes it easy to go to your room whenver you want. There are 2 nice pools for both the family environment as well as the adult pool for those who just want to relax. They also have the best lifeguards around who pay the best attention to swimmers both in the ocean and at the pool. When you look out one side of the resort you gaze into the ocean, the other side a beautiful view of the rain forrest.

We rented a car, which I do suggest to get around some in some of the best highways I have encountered away from the U,S, As for the negatives, the parking cost $25.00 daily, which greatly offsets the low cost rental of a vehicle. I thought this was out of control. The drinks were close to twice what is charged at most other locations, an adjustment is needed in this area. Finally, the menu for breakfast and lunch could use enhancement. However, it was not bad. Overall, keep in mind that travel is an adventure.

I did not rent a car, rather I took several tours that i booked privately ( less expensive than the hotel bookings). I also chose not to eat at the premier restaurants at the resort. Instead, I ate at the beach side burger bar and at the lobby coffee shop neat the casino, both were reasonable and the food was enjoyable. This is a resort, of course they aim to make money, wisely choose how you will spend your money. The resort is in the mountains, it is not in San Juan, this I knew when I booked and researched the trip, therefore, it is rediculous to complain that is is not near anything, it is also untrue, it is near the rainforest and reasonably close to Fajardo where boats leave for amazing snorkling and other aquatic trips. Renting a car is advisable for those wishing to explore more of the Island. The roads are wide, multi lanes and the driving usually doesn't exceed 55 mph. If you don't rent, you must plan carefully or you will spend a lot to see the sights away from the resort.The onsite spa was amazing, I actually will return to this resort in part for more of the excellent spa treatment. This resort is well maintained and customer friendly. I found the staff professional, curteous and helpful, I suppose if you approach the staff with respect it will be returned, unfortunately, many travelers have a colonial mentality that usually results in rebuke. Before you travel, join the Wyndham club ( its free), you wil be eligible for free room upgrades if available. I got an amazing Ocean View room that really made the expierience that much more refreshing. The beach was ok, the water was warm and reasonably clear, some sea weed and organic matter due to close proximity to the rain forest, the snorkling trip led to clearer water, I used The Fun Cat company, and Caprain Jim provided good information about the island for meals etc. Ri0 Mar is a great place to relax, unwind and enjoy. It is not club Med and it is not Manhattan.It is a first rate resort tucked away in the mountains. Please do not believe those who found this resort to be a rip off, it is what you make it, I didnt want to pay for a $40 meal so I went into town and got an $18 meal.

My daughter was 4 months pregnant and was able to make the hike just fine. Also, the higher you go up the mountain, the cooler the breezes are so it wasn't that hot. We also went on a kayak trip from the Fajardo marina to the big bioluminescent lagoon. This is something everyone who visits PR shoud not miss. One of the coolest things we have ever done.

All the staff was very polite except for one parking attendant who seemed stressed out every time we went to have our parking ticket validated. You do need to rent a car since the resort is isolated from night life and restaurants. Parking is $15 per day and I do wish it would have been free it is no big deal to pay $15 a day for it. The pool was nice and warm throughout the day. The pool is open 24hrs, yet no staff will be present around the pool until around 8AM to 6PM. The drinks at the pool bar are water down and somewhat expensive but like I stated before what do you expect while on vacation? Do visit Old San Juan since there are good shops there to buy souvenirs and good restaurants. I do recommend going to \"Raices\", which has amazing PR food there and located right in the middle of the shopping stores in Old San Juan. If you are going to visit \"El Morro\" in San Juan there are 2 different forts that look the same. One is called the castle of San Cristobal, you can park there for free and pay $3pp to see the castle of San Cristobal or pay $5pp to see the \"castle of San Cristobal\" and \"El Morro\" which is about 1/2 mile from each other. There is a free trolley that takes you from San Cristobal to El Morro. That same trolley pretty much takes you all around Old San Juan and is totally free. We took the trolley while shopping and went around trying to see which restaurant to eat. NOTE: if you do park in the castle of \"San Cristobal\" and go shopping in the nearby shops they do close the parking lot at 6PM and you will get towed and pay a fine of $125. So make sure you get your car out the \"San Cristobal\" parking before 6PM. Do go to the Bacardi Rum Distillery since they give you a tour of their place and even provide a few free good drinks at their bar. Any questions or directions you might have regarding directions ask the Wyndham activity desk located in the main lobby (located across the check in desk in main lobby). I recommend going to \"El Yunque\" rain forest since there are amazing views of the rain forest and waterfalls. Make sure your car is fueled up before you go into the rain forest since the uphill drive up the mountain drains your gas tank very quickly. Make sure you have your gym shoes while in the rainforest. Another good restaurant which is located towards Fajardo is called \"Todo Coco\" which all there drinks and pretty much all their food is made of coconut. Amazing restaurant and good desserts. Another good restaurant is called \"Don Pepe\" which is not to far from the resort about 1 1/2 miles going towards San Juan which was also very good. If you rent a car w/ a GPS be careful since those GPS devices are outdated and might not show all the current restaurants of attractions one is seeking. Overall, The trip was very good and the resort very clean and staff is very polite if they are approached in a human way instead of kicking and screaming demanding to have it your way. And I saw a lot of grown ups acting like babies for simple reasons of not having enough towels in the room. By the way, room service is daily if you choose to have your sheets and towels replaced. I recommend leaving a nice little tip for the room service people.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison Hts, MI", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort - Fabulous Trip!\u201d", "Author": "dozias", "ReviewID": "UR31021410", "Content": "I have read some of the reviews on here and I'm a little shocked. I stayed here at the beginning of May with a friend and we had a wonderful time. The reviews about it being costly is correct. You can't eat any meal for less than $50 for 2 people and the drinks are a bit high but the service and employees were wonderful and we expected the pricing being at a nice resort. You could certainly take a short taxi or rent a car to get some wonderful local food for very cheap. We booked our trip through Cheapcarribean.com and had no issues with that. Our transfer from the airport was included and the driver was very friendly. When we arrived at the hotel at 9am, we asked if we could possibly check in early. They had no problem with this and sent us to our room. However, when we got back from breakfast they were cleaning it - apparently it wasn't ready when we threw our things in there - so we went down to get another room. That room wasn't ready either so finally on the third try we did get a wonderful room on the 7th floor. They gave us free breakfast and a credit of $100. They were very friendly and we were fine with it since we were checking in 6 hours early. The rooms were nice, we had a lovely view of the rainforest and the beds were extremely comfy! The resort is just gorgeous. We loved the pool areas and the bar outside. The adult pool was very relaxing and quiet with very comfortable lounge chairs and the other pool was fun if you wanted a change of scenery. They have a water slide, volleyball net in the water and fun things happening throughout the day. Watch out for all of the iguanas around the pool. We thought they were very sweet and even fed them one day, however, some people were so mean and would chase the poor things. They didn't bother you if you left them alone though. We loved Xavier's special cocktails at the bar outside! The spa was nice as well, although we have had better massages but it was nice to relax and be pampered. We also tried most of the restaurants and had wonderful meals every time. We also took a couple tours through the hotel. We did the rainforest tour as well as the Bacardi tour and had a great time on both. The tour guides were both entertaining and very informative. Everyone we came across was very friendly and helpful. We also rented a car for the day from the hotel. I would definitely reccommend renting one ahead of time from the airport. We paid $90 for only one day! Old San Juan was beautiful, we definitely recommend going there for dinner or to shop. Definitely go to Riaces for authentic Puerto Rican food - it was amazing!

We wanted a long weekend with no worries! We arrived, via JETBLUE, on Thursday, May 21st at 2:30 am. Yes, am! Upon check in, we were greeted by a lovely woman at the front desk. Very nice and check in was a snap. We were directed to our ocean front junior suite. Upon entering the room, we were impressed. It was big and very clean. However, once we openned the curtains to reveal our ocean front view, our mood changed. We were on the ground floor and you could barely make out anything in front of us (yes, it was dark - but you could see a building and a lot of garbage). It seems our room was next to the service entrance. I called the front desk and the woman was very nice. We walked back to the desk and she called her manager. He spent a good 30 minutes trying to get us a different room. Two attempts later (the other two rooms we looked out were not acceptable and he even agreed), we accepted a $200 resort credit and headed back to our original junior suite. It was 4:20 am by the time we got to \"bed\". The next four days were fantastic! The resort is BEAUTIFUL! Very, very clean and we found every single staff member wonderful. The resort was not very crowded the first two days (Thursday/Friday) but did pick up as the weekend arrived. Also, the room ended up being great - as you can see from the pictures - the view wasn't that bad. Yes, the service entrance wasn't ideal, but they did give us $200 in credit and we already had a $100 credit as part of our package. We found the adult pool perfect. It was great not worrying about kids splashing around. The seat cushions were very comfortable too. We are morning people so we would be out by the pool by 8 am each morning. The adult pool did fill up by around 10 am. But, everybody was great and no \"fights\" for a spot occured. The one thing that is annoying are the cabanas. YOu need to pay $150 a day for them - you get drinks and snacks - but $150 is just not worth it. They should charge $50 a day and they would rent them all! Just my opinion of course. The only annoying part about the adult pool was that the jacuzzi wasn't working. They were waiting for a part to come in. Oh yeah, watch for falling iguana. (see pictures) They would drop randomly into the pool. Also, they are EVERY place! It is really cool. The food at the resort is typical resort food. I am not sure why so many people found it soo expensive. Was it cheap? NO - but you are on vacation and you should expect to pay more. We averages $100 a night for dinner (salads, entrees, two drinks each). For breakfast/lunch there is a very inexpensive shop by the casino.. You can get a huge wrap for $8! They also have great coffee :)! Also there has been a lot of fuss about drink prices. We didn't think $10 for a frozen drink was crazy. Any other resort we have been to charges that much if not more. Also, each day they run a drink special for $6.50. There is happy hour each night at the outside bar too. The $30 for a six pack of beer is pretty reasonable too. Where else do you pay $5 for a beer? We did not enjoy the casino - very small and the people working the tables weren't the nicest. We lost $60 bucks and decided this casino wasn't for us. But others loved it. Cannot speak of an tours - we didn't do any. This trip was all about relaxation. We were at the pool from 8 am - 4 pm each day and it was great. I think this hotel was wonderful! They were painting the foyers and exterior during our stay so they are mainting it. I would happily go back!

The resort is beautiful, as was our room. In short, we experienced none of the problems noted by some reviewers: we booked a third party package (through CheapCaribbean) and our airport transfer and check-in were trouble-free. As for the resort itself, the high points are its size and the beauty of the grounds, the palm-lined pools (complete with a giant hot tub), the charming casino, proximity to El Yunque rain forest park, and the privacy of the beach. The resort borders a stretch of undeveloped forest so you can stroll along the beach for a quarter mile and feel like you're on a remote island. Perhaps because we arrived in the off-season, the resort had a quiet and spacious feel. The potential drawbacks are the distance from the city and nightlife, and the relatively high cost of the on-site restaurants.

The reason? In three nights, we are about to make a fourth move. The first room flooded when we took a shower, I called down to the desk and we waited about 30 to 40 minutes, then my husband called back for them to tell him that I told them that he was just showering with the curtain open. Then the maintenance finally arrived but there was so much standing water that he wanted house keeping to come and help clean it so he could tell where the problem was. We waited over an hour for someone to show up. All in all I stayed in the room almost 3 hours dealing with this. That afternoon, we went to see the Wyndam people(Wyndham has not fully taken over) thinking because we are owners that they might be able to do something. They did, they called down and had our room upgraded. Next step get help moving to the 5th floor, want to guess how long it took the bellman? 45 min to an hour. For that they compted our breakfast the following morning(remember that part for the next day). Finally on the fifth floor, we went to sleep that night, when we woke up the next morning there was standing water on the floor again! How? I'm not sure. My husband then went to complain and since we had already scheduled our excursion to the rain forest we didn't have time to sit around and deal with that. The front desk assured us that upon our return that afternoon, we would be given a new room and maintenance would check out our other one. Guess what? None of that happened. I had to go back to Wyndham and they had to call the front desk to make anything happen. The manager on duty told my husband, \"We have already compted off your breakfast this morning, what else do you want?\" Really? BTW, if you eat at the hotel for two, expect to spend a minimum of about $150 a day, she saved us a whopping $50 off of that. Wyndham did get our room moved to down the hall. Room #3-So far no flooding with this one, but we did learn an interesting tid bit fromt the maintenance man, only about 60% of the hotel is operational, the rest of the rooms have problems. So getting back to why we are leaving. The room they put us in has a connecting door with an inch and a half space underneath. Our \"roommates next door,\" came in about an hour ago, along with the bellsman, he gave them a full run down on the room and then they unpacked.

However, we were looking for a quick, inexpensive, quiet beach weekend and chose the Wyndham over Hilton's El Con on a significant price difference and better proximity to the beach. The good: - Proximity to the beach; it's right there, with beach chairs and almost no local visitors - Hotel building and grounds were lovely - Some of the bar staff were exceptional - Room was comfortable and clean - Location -- 30 mi from the city and on the beach -- met our needs - On-site car rental was convenient for a quick trip to the rainforest The horror: - Because we booked through our airline's travel agency and not Wyndham, we were treated like second-class citizens. Here's how: * Airport transfers were included in our package, however, Wyndham refused to honor them and we spent several hours between repeat visits to the front desk and the tour desk and calls to the travel agency to get it straightened out. Not the best use of our time for a three-night stay. The Wyndham staff was unhelpful, rude and unapologetic during this process. * Our first room assignment was on the 7th floor. The bell cap who brought our luggage was unable to unlock the door. We waited in the hallway for nearly a half-hour until the bell cap came back, was still unable to unlock the door and had us re-assigned to a room on the 5th floor. One would think that following the inconvenience, Wyndham would have upgraded our room and, at minimum, apologized. If you thought that, you would be wrong. The 5th floor was more run-down than the 7th floor. Our room was on the same level as the roof of the casino. The mechanical noise and exhaust smell were awful. And, the room felt unsecured; on our third day, we saw people walking on the roof. See photo for awful view from the room. During our second visit to the front desk to address the airport transfer issue, I mentioned our dissatisfaction with our room and received a blank stare in response. * Because we booked through an agency, we were charged $40, yes $40, for internet service. Although we had called the front desk in advance of using the service and \"confirmed\" that there would be no charge, and although the signs at the front desk advertised that Wyndham rewards members receive free internet, we were charged $40. The front desk staff at checkout refused to remove the charge and told us that it was because we booked through an agency. * Like other reviewers have said, the food is expensive (meals ranged from $50 - $125 for 2) and the quality does not match the cost. Again, we were told that because we booked through an agency, we would not earn any Wyndham points for our out-of-pocket expenses or our hotel nights. The front desk refused to even take down our Wyndham number. * And, when we spoke with the concierge desk about booking a tour, their first question was had we booked through Wyndham. Then, coincidence?, none of the tours we requested were available or being offered. Would we go back? Maybe -- the adult pool and beach were *that* nice and the total cost was good -- but, we're more likely to stay brand-loyal to Hilton and not be nickled and dimed and treated like second-class citizens at the Wyndham.", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "FL", "Title": "\u201cLooks can be deceiving\u201d", "Author": "Mhogg", "ReviewID": "UR30389451", "Content": "Luckily I went to priceline and got the room for $120.

I can't say that any of us would recommend this hotel, as it did not leave an impression that would bring us back. One thing we were disappointed on was there was no essence of Puerto Rico anywhere in the resort. We expected to see local artwork, or even local cuisine (trying local food on the buffet for a tourist would have been perfect), but there was nothing. They also had limited activities at the resort, or the activities were too expensive. Overall we all enjoyed ourselves in Puerto Rico, but none of us plan to go back. Service: Hotel has good service. The weekday staff are extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. But the weekend crew was just the opposite. We noticed a drastic difference between the two shifts. One morning at the buffet we had the best waiter ever, and then for dinner at the Tiki Bar we were ignored for over a half an hour. It was never consistent. Also, the hours for some of the restaurants were not very \"user friendly\" for a resort. Price: Everything at the resort is overpriced. Breakfast buffet was $20 per person. A burger/fries were $13. Drinks were expensive for the amount you get, highly recommend buying alcohol at a grocery store and making drinks in your room, also might want to pick up disposable cooler as most rooms don't have fridges. We saw many coolers outsides rooms after everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay. Load up on snacks/beverages/etc as there is nothing close by except the kiosks, we went to one but most looked like they were about to collapse (very run down looking) and we didn't feel comfortable. Room: We had two rooms for two couples. The rooms were nice looking, but one room was cleaned very well everyday and the other was not. Because the rooms are not carpeted you will have sand in your room for your entire stay, they tried to mop it up on our second to last day of our trip, which wasn't helpful. Our view from the room was less than desirable (view of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s park and road to parking lot). Hotel was not fully booked so we thought that was pretty lousy to give us such a crappy view when obviously so many rooms were available. We can only imagine that it is because we booked through Hotwire and our rooms were \"discounted\", but this did leave us with bad impression of the resort. Note: Do not waste your time on their rewards card if you book through Hotwire, they told us at check-in that it is only valid if you book through the hotel direct, would be nice to say that somewhere when you open the card wouldn't it? Location: After visiting San Juan, we all wished we had stayed closer to the city. Rio Mar is out in the middle of nowhere. It was not very convenient. Highly recommend renting a car. The cost of the rental more than pays for itself when you add up all the additional costs of taking all the separate tours that the resort can set you up with. Misc: The casino is quite small and gets very crowded on Friday and Saturday. The adult pool was perfect, loved the no kids rule. The beach is very nice and quiet, only bummer was we had high wave advisories the whole time so not much swimming or water activities. If you rent a car PLEASE watch out for Puerto Rican drivers!! Most do not have fully functioning lights so braking is quite the experience. Think about the insurance for a rental car as most Puerto Ricans do not have car insurance or pay very close attention when you drive. Also, buy the full tank of gas from the rental place. MUCH easier and gas is cheaper when dropping off unless you do not use the full tank during your vacation. If you are limited on time, definitely don't waste your precious time on the timeshare presentation for a free something or other Tours: We highly recommend going to the El Yunque Rainforest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we loved it.

This resort was only 40% occupied during our visit. This resulted in the resort closing some of its restaurants. So with that being said, its almost a must to rent a car to enjoy some of the local flavor outside of the resort. PRO's - The resort staff are overly friendly, curtious and accomodating. I felt they went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. - The rooms, resort grounds and golf courses are clean and immaculate. - Avis car rental is on-site at the resort, so if you didnt rent a car and decide to ..... its an option which is what we did. CON's - As previous reviews stated \"Food and Drinks are Pricey\", but we expected it. - Guests are required to pay for parking when renting a car. The first 24 hours are free. I can see local visitors paying for parking, but not guests. - Pool cabana's - These need to be rented in order to use. Not one person rented a Cabana during our stay. Probably due to the high cost. As a result, they were empty. - Night life - Unless your a gambler there is absolutely nothing to do at night. - Casino - No Craps tables. - Excercise Gym - Very small, limited machines and free weights for the size of the resort. If the resort was at full capacity i feel that it may have been a problem to work out. We are beach and sun people and werent a fan of the beach and ocean. If your looking for the white beaches and caribbean water this is not the place for you. The sand is dark brown and the water is murky where the waves break. I do recommend seeing the Rain Forest which is 10-15 min away from the resort. The views are breathtaking. Also, the 45 - 60 min ride to Old San Juan is worth the trip.

The service experienced form all employees was attentive to our needs and quite genuine which was a huge plus for us. Our room was a standard hotel room, but we will say both of the queen beds were very comfortable. Flat screen TV was nice even though we didn't use it much (a good thing..we're on vacation, right?) Bathroom was very acceptable, good water pressure. All rooms appeared to also have a small balcony with a table and two chairs. We were oceanfront with a great view of the pool area with the ocean in the background beyond that. The location of the resort is ~45-60 minutes outside of San Juan Airport....We rented a car which would be our recommendation to other travelers as Taxi service to and from the airport alone is ~$80 each way.....Avis also has a car rental service on site at the resort, so you could taxi it to/from the airport, then rent a car for any daily excursions outside the resort. The resort is quite secluded and literally within minutes of the Rainforest which you have great views of right from the Resort itself. While the weather pattern was a bit stubborn throughout our stay, it really didn't have a major impact on our experience. It was raining at the Rainforest (not a surprise I guess...It's a \"rain\" forest after all), but not at the resort....So, we didn't have full sun throughout any day during our stay, but 80-85 degrees and periodic sun allowed for great relaxation throughout the day....Evenings at the resort can be spent walking the expansive grounds, hanging out in the outdoor jacuzzi's, at the bar or in the on-site casino... Would recommend a day trip to either Culebra or Vieques islands (ferry from Fajardo), the Rainforest, Old San Juan.... While we did most breakfast and lunch at the resort, we chose to dine away from the Resort. We did 2 nights at Richie's Restaurant just up the hill with shuttles service to/from. It's complete open-air dining with spectacular views overlooking the resort and Atlantic....One of the nights we dined with two other couples which made for a fun evening to say the least. The other mentionable dining was just past Richie's at the Terasco Monte Mar (Terrace on the Mountain overlooking the Sea)...Good food, reasonable priced, yet service was not quite Richie's.......We also had a lunch at one of the Kiosk's (#57) at Luquillo Beach.....Luquillo Beach is ~5 miles from the resort and a very nice beach at that......

For example: a can of sprite cost $3.50... they will charge you $3.50 for the delivery charge... and expect gratuity... lets say $1.00... which totals to $8.00 for a can of soda..... -drinks: from a mudslide to a beer... its $10 to $12 each .... a glass of orange juice is $4.50 -if you want a can of soda in the middle of the night, they DO NOT have a vending machine in the hotel -The hotel room does not include a refrigerator...you have to rent it for 25$/day -very limited service.... I wanted a massage out doors.... in order to do that... you HAVE TO rent a cabana which cost $150.00/day and a 50 min massage cost $120 -The $150.00 cabana will provide you some chips and a cooler with a few cans of soda and water.... NOT WORTH IT! -its about $50-$90 dollars to take a taxi anywhere.... -NO NIGHT LIFE, except for the small casino that is open until 2 am -it is completely far and secluded from the city, very boring for singles -it was very windy when we went the first week of may PROS: - the place is beautiful and clean - our hotel room is pretty, the mattress is soft and the sheets are silky smooth - very romantic for couples - the pool is nice, with a fun little waterslide - the palio (italian) restaurant is very romantic with live piano music - the beach is torquoise blue and the waves are strong, good for boogie boarding - the service is average, some more friendly than others - as for the excursions, we only visited the bioluminescent bay.... well it was cool for the first 5 mins you see the water glow when you disturb it... wasn't as exciting as I thought it was going to be.... definitely bring BUG SPRAY because you had to kayak through a dark rainforest to get to the lagoon.... it was ok.... definitely a new experience So I'm 50/50 with my trip.... but was really disappointed with how much they take advantage of your money.... if the prices were at least reasonable... My boyfriend and I would have had a fabulous time Here are some helpful hints: 1) Rent a car.... its worth it.... although parking is $20/day -rent the car at the airport, it cost 65$ one way to the hotel (with a taxi at the airport) and the hotel charges 37.50$/per person one way to the airport 2) Buy food and liquor at the grocery for your snacks and drinks during the day 3) buy a disposable cooler for your drinks If you rent a car, the excursions are 50% cheaper because you have your own transportation for example the bioluminescent bay is $54/per person vs $99 Plus, you get to eat outside of the hotel and SAVE SO MUCH MONEY!

We rented a car so we could have them in car seats. It was an easy ride from the airport (although over an hour for the car rental process at Enterprise!). Also, I had read about how expensive the food was on site so we wanted options. Good thing, as the one nice dinner at the hotel with the kids was $175 -- and they shared a dish! Upon arriving we quickly discovered that our sink was stopped up. We told them right away and then left the room. When we returned a couple of hours later, it was still broken. We went back to the desk and told them again. They promised to fix it while we were out. Still not fixed when we got back from dinner so we were washing our hands and brushing our teeth in the tub. Annoying. The next morning we went out for breakfast for 3 hours and returned to find the maid in our room with towels covering the bathroom floor. The sink was still broken and we told the desk AGAIN (this time a little aggravated). We left again to go to the pool and returned 3 hours later for my youngest to take a nap. As soon as she laid down, in come the work crew to fix it. There goes the nap. At this point we were highly irritated and went back to the desk. I ended up sitting in the lobby with my 2 year old who was beyond exhausted at this point. She fell asleep on me, while I sat on a couch, for 3 hours. Needless to say, she slept well but it was extremely uncomfortable and totally inconvenient. I have a very busy job and needed to work on my laptop in my room, but was unable. While I was sitting there, a very nice manager came over and told me she had spoken to my husband. She was very, very apologetic and wanted to make it right. I told her I would talk to my husband and get back to her. Later, we found her and told her we felt a $200 credit to our account would make up for the entire day that was spent dealing with that. She was in total agreement that it was a fair amount and gave us her card, telling us to call if we needed ANYTHING. That woman knows how to smooth things over! The rest of the trip was much more enjoyable. Although a bit worn down in spots, the hotel is nice and seems clean. The pools were great and my kids loved the water slide and the beach. The landscaping is nice. We parked in the garage for $15 a day (the car rental was $100) but what we saved in being able to eat off site made it worth the cost. The one dinner we had (courtesy of that credit!) on site was very, very nice. We left other nights to eat at La Parilla at the kioskos (less than 10 minutes away) and another night at....I think it was called King Seafood (or something like that) in Luquillo, which was about 15 minutes. Both were fantastic meals and the restaurants were well suited for kids -- not to mention much less expensive. Not sure I would return but if someone I knew was going I would say overall, the price was right, as the four of us traveled, including air, hotel, car and all food for under $3000. Not bad for a family of four.

I will start by saying that I read several reviews on TripAdvisor before booking and was aware of the 'negatives' that other people highlighted in their reviews. I stayed for a week and was very impressed with the cleanliness of the resort and the outstanding service. All of the employees were extremely friendly and courteous. The staff at concierge were very professional and, for the most part, right on about their recommendations and directions to area attractions. The housekeeping staff were very attentive to the rooms - it seemed like every time we went somewhere (beach, casino, dinner, etc.) we would come back and our room was cleaned, towels replaced, and bed made. Yes, the walls are a bit thin but my recommendation is to let them know if you are not satisfied and see if they can switch your room. I was originally on the sixth floor facing the ocean and they had some renovation work going on near my room which became a bit noisy. I simply requested a different room and they were happy to accommodate my request. The change only took 30 min because they had someone come up and help us move luggage and bags. Others have mentioned that the drinks are expensive and I noticed this as well. We went to the local grocery store (Amigo at 3rd light east on hwy 3 or there's a wal mart and another grocery store at 5th light to east on hwy 3) to buy drinks that we could pack in a bag and take with us to the beach which was more cost effective. The local restaurants we visited and enjoyed were as follows: La Parilla (kioscos), El Jefe (kioscos), Isamar Bakery (at hwy 3 intersection - breakfast), Brass Cactus (Luquillo), Pasion Por El Fogon (Fajardo), and La Estacion (Fajardo). All very good. If you're headed to San Juan we ate at Parrot Club one night and Barrachina another night, both on Fortaleza St. and were very good. We didn't eat at the resort except for the last day when we had the buffet breakfast. A little pricy but it was very tasty and a good way to end the trip. We did a self-guided rainforest adventure in a half day. El Yunque is very unique and close to the resort so you should check it out. No need to plan more than half day though. We went to the casino twice during our stay and were there for 1 hr each time. The staff were professional and polite and the waiters offered to serve drinks. We went on a catamaran sailing and snorkeling excursion to a local island off Fajardo. This was a very well-organized trip - we had a great time snorkeling and swimming in the aqua blue waters. They also provide a nice lunch aboard and several fruits to much on later in the day. We tried out the bioluminescent lagoon kayaking with kayaking puerto rico. This was a great time and well worth the $45 per person. Tip: book direct rather than going through the hotel, they were selling the same trip for $99. The hotel pools were very nice and well-kept. The adult pool lounge chairs get used so you may want to get down there by 10 or 11am to get a seat. I don't have kids but it seemed like there was plenty for young ones to do between the iguanas, beach, activity pool, kids club, etc. They also have a decent exercise facility and a jogging path so bring your shoes if you'd like a workout. Very nice spa also but didn't try it out. Overall this was a great trip and we enjoyed the hotel amenities. If you are expecting a four seasons or some other palace environment then maybe you should look elsewhere.

The waves were pretty big, but we enjoyed it. The casino is not large, but a lot of fun. The restaurants are pretty good. The only complaint I have about the food was with the rice (white and yellow) which was not good (some grains were not fully cooked). However, the cilantro rice (green) is absolutely delicious. Shimas Restaurant serves a very good filet mignon in a ginger sauce. Overall, this is a great place to spend a few days, if all you are looking for is R&R.

The overall feel when you first walk in is amazing, the facility is absolutely beautiful. After that is when the problems arise. First the check in to the resort isn't until 4pm, but in my case the room wasn't ready until 6pm. We had arrived at the resort at 1pm and had to wait 5 hours until we had a room that was ready for us. Second, they lured us to the resort with \"special accommodations, still averaging well over $300 per night, to present us with a time share opportunity on properties that haven't even been started. We went to the sales presentation and salesperson Wilfredo informed us that the only people who don't buy are either stupid or too broke to actually afford the timeshare. I don't fall into either category. I found that when my spouse started asking pretty straight forward answers to obvious questions like can we see them, when does the construction start, and what is the cost we got generic poster board type answers. The only way they would give you any real information was if you committed to buying one and then they ran a credit approval on you. Sorry, that crap doesn't fly with me. Give me the answers that I want then, if I'm interested I'll allow you to look at my credit. Third issue, there was a total lack of quality staff the entire time we were at this resort. We watched as the waiters at the Tiki bar were very quick to wait on the single women in the bikini's while leaving the rest of us to fend for ourselves for drinks. This didn't just happen once, several times. We sat on the beach one day watching the waiter bring drinks to the girls next to us several times. We finally got him to get us one, after that he purposely walked to the other side of the girls as not to have to wait on us. Also, there is a sign by the cafe next to the casino that states buy one get one free on frozen drinks and mojitos at the Tiki from 5-7, but when you try and order them they tell you no those drinks are full price, over $10 a piece. The last day we actually took a picture and brought it down to the bar and showed them, they just shrugged there shoulders and said no. We got the bar manager to come over, we showed him the picture and he asked us not to tell the other guests of the resort and we could have the drinks at that price. I asked if we could get credit on all the drinks we had to pay full price on and he said no. This customer service was horrible at that bar. Forth, the casino was way understaffed. Don't hold your breath to get a drink in there as I think the cocktail waitress goes to Tahiti and back to bring your drinks. Over the course of the week we went to the casino 4 nights for between 2 and 5 hours a night. Twice we saw absolutely no waitress and the other two we actually gave the pit boss a hard time until he got one to serve us. The other issue in the casino was the lack of staff on the gaming tables themselves. At one point there were over 20 people waiting to play blackjack and the only thing the pit boss did was decide favorites on who would actually get on the one table when someone got up, not open another table. The worst part was they let people in when spots opened up at there discretion, not based on who was waiting the longest. Why not just open more tables up? Fifth, on the last day of our stay as we are on our way out of the resort to explore old San Juan, the front desk decided they wanted us to move our room. This wouldn't have been a problem except the basically wanted us to check out and then they wouldn't have another room ready for us until 4pm, which we already new at that point meant closer to 6pm. We were getting on a plane at 4 am, so it made no sense to get a room at this posh place for less than 10 hours. When we said that if they wanted that, to just cancel our last night of reservation they decided to let us keep our room for that last night and take our money. Positives of the resort are few, but include, Palio for dinner, the rooms are very small but clean, and the views are breathtaking. The negatives are overpriced, rude staffing, and poor advertising of what you actually get. My advice would be to stay away from this hotel, if you already booked, get food and beverages outside of the resort and bring them with you. Palmers bakery is right across route 3 and right at the gas station. Utilize the convenient store at the corner for as much as possible. Pick up a $6 Styrofoam cooler from there and pack it with ice for your beverages as sodas and water on resort are between $3.50 and $5.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rock HIll, SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat place - had it's hiccups\u201d", "Author": "bigmak05", "ReviewID": "UR28495975", "Content": "The hotel was great: Good views, beautiful beach, nice pools, friendly staff, and all around good atmosphere. The hotel and resort really lends itself to people with children - there were tons! It was okay for adults only groups. Watch out for the food! This was our biggest expense of the trip. For the most part we ate at the resort. The Grill Room was okay but super expensive! They get you because instead of ordering and getting a full meal you have to piece together a meal (entrees, sides, salads, etc. were all seperate). Sushami was by far the best, pretty resonable sushi and great desserts. The Tiki bar for lunch as okay but still pretty pricey plus there wasn't that many tables to eat at. Marbella's was okay, much better food than The Grill Room but still about the same price point. Best suggestion would be to load up on munchies off site (get a cheap cooler if you want to refridgerate anything). Make sure you also try Richie's which is off site but they have a van that comes and picks you up and takes you back free of charge. I would recommend the Mofungo! Airport Transfer - we got burned on this one! - The website states that they provide transportation and when we called to confirm assured us they would be there, end of story. Well, happy to say they came through and someone was there to meet us for the shuttle. However, when we went to check-in for the shuttle they asked if we had a travel voucher. Being the first time we heard of this we said no and were told that if would cost $37.50 per person per way for the shuttle to the airport. So for two people round trip it cost $150!!! I found this to be outrageous considering gas was $0.50 per gallon. It wasn't like there was one or two people they had to pick up either, the van was always packed. Towel: The hotel is really great in that it provides free towels for pool use - the only problem was they were never any available. Out of the four days we were there we were only able to get towels once and even then we had to wait a good 20 minutes before we ever got them.

We set up our own evening kayak trip with Akuadventures in glass bottom kayaks to see the bio-luminescent tour-highly recommended . We did a catamaran snorkelling trip with \"Traveler\"-they had the best price and offer snacks and lunch on board with a slightly smaller boat than the others tours. This makes the experience more personal and is a great family activity with children that can swim. Even those who do not wish to snorkel can enjoy the boat, the views or walk along the island beaches. This was my family's favorite part of our trip!

The hotel is located about 45 minutes east of San Juan, the perfect location for all the eastern Puerto Rico sites - El Yunque, Bio Bay tours, Fajardo snorkel and dive trips, etc. The hotel staff could not have been more friendly. The faciltiy and grounds are spotless and the guestrooms are larger than average. Our family of 4 (with 2 teenagers) was quite comfortable. The ocean view balcony is a nice touch. The beach is very big with some fun waves, but it is a little rough for smaller children. This is the Atlantic Ocean, NOT the Caribbean so you will have waves and some seaweed, not the crystal clear calm water you get in the Caribbean. If you want calm, head east toward Fajardo - you can find it you just need to know where to look. I would echo the other reviews encouraging you to book your own tours and excursions. For example the Bio Bay tour was $95 booked thorugh the hotel, and we only paid $45 booked directly with the tour company. A car is a must if you plan to spend time at all the the wonderful spots located near the hotel. The proximity to El Yunque allows you to get to the park before the tour buses from San Juan. We spend two great days hiking there, starting about 9AM and rarely saw a soul. But on our way out the crowds and tour groups were pouring in. The only negative aspect of the hotel was the island resort food prices. Typical of what you would pay at similar properties, but quite expensive. Drinks $10, lunch $20/person, etc. The hotel charges you to install a refrigerator in your room - this seems a bit much at a hotel of this class. Go into town and buy your own beverages, snacks, muffins, etc. Ice them all down for the day - I saw a number of people with styrofoam coolers at the beach. There are a number of good restaurant choices withing 10-15 minutes of the hotel. They have a list at the concierge desk if you ask - everything we tried from the list was good. It is nice to get out of the resort and spend some time in the real Puerto Rico for part of your trip. Without exception, the people in Puerto Rico are very friendly - not just in tourist locations. Gas station attenedants, Walgreens clerks, etc. Puerto Rico is a wonderful place to visit, offering things to do beyond the beach that many other tropical locations cannot.

The resort setting is gorgeous, with a long, curving beach, two beautiful pools (one for adults), many lounges on the beach itself--where the waves pound and foam--good lunch food served at the Tiki Bar, a very friendly and helpful staff, lovely rooms and balconies, plus choices of many sports. It is not inexpensive (add 25% to room rates for taxes), but we are returning much more relaxed with hopes of going back. Unlike some islands, the people here are friendly and welcoming. We liked the fact that we could leave the resort to easily visit El Yunque (a 15 minute drive) or eat at the wonderful kiosks at Luqillo Beach (also a 15 minute drive.) At El Yunque, there is a two hour or one hour hike that anyone can enjoy. The cost of food is a little high, but people find their own compromises. We purchased a few things for breakfast before we arrived and paid $25 for a room refrigerator. The lunch sandwiches are large and can be shared. If you know in advance that lunch sandwiches will be $9-12, you'll be prepared. Nearby you can find reasonable restaurants. If you do not have a car, the hotel can phone Richie's for you, and they send a van to bring you up the hill to their beautiful overlook. We found the portions so large that we preferred sharing entrees. Our friends also recommended the hotel restaurants. If you've read the poor reviews of this hotel from past years, you should know that the present management is doing a fine job--providing a very friendly staff and a well-cared-for property. The physical beauty of the grounds is enough reason for wanting to return there--a beautiful pool area with plenty of seating around the pools and on the attractive beach-front.

We actually had booked the resort based off reviews on Tripadvisor and had forgotten to even look at pictures of the resort! Much to our delight, the resort was picture perfect with friendly staff greeting us and a good feeling of safety tucked deep in its own plot of land far away from the road leading to the resort itself. Booking into the hotel was easy and quick. The staff was very nice and even made and upgrade to our booking which we made through Priceline. To breakdown the resort: Appearance/Cleanliness - Can't complain at all. The resort had a semi-luxurious feel without being ostentatious nor ridiculously opulent. Everything was clean, but there were some signs of wear. We never encountered any dirty towels, cups or anything of that sort. Overall the resort was pretty close to spotless though slightly aging. Staff Friendliness/Helpfulness - The staff was always pleasant and courteous in the resort itself. The concierges were somewhat helpful, but we asked for some fairly standard things (e.g. seeing El Yunque, going to Fajardo and San Juan, etc). I have the feeling that if you were to ask the concierges for something a bit more off the beaten path or for places that aren't on the resort's list of places or tours to sell that you wouldn't get as much help. The only thing which we didn't like was that the Rio Mar's staff kept insisting that we attend a sales seminar for some future investment property. We're on a vacation, who wants to waste a few hours of their vacation for a lousy $75 credit in the resort? Dining - Restaurants were as expected in a resort. Overpriced, average in quality and average in service. We didn't expect anything stellar and were certainly weren't pleasantly surprised or disappointed. Amenities - The pools were great that there was a separate adult pool. The hot tub was far too small and always crowded, mostly with teenagers hanging out with their friends and parents. The beach is right in front of the hotel, you can't ask for a better location nor a nicer beach! The casino was small and kind of useless to be honest and we didn't partake in golfing so... well we can't comment. The nightlife was susprisingly alive with live music, karaoke and dancing. The computer room was a nice touch, but also too busy, mostly with kids of adults who forget that children should be supervised not just shoved in front of a computer when on vacation. Parents... it's 11pm do you know where your kids are? Location - Perfectly close if you have a car to almost everything you should see in Puerto Rico. El Yunque is only 10 minutes away, Luquillo is 15 minutes away, San Juan and Fajardo are both 30 minutes away. Value - The resort was well priced, but we did book through Priceline. The restaurants were overpriced, but inline with resort pricing. Don't bother buying water or snacks there, it's also way overpriced. The parking fees were a bit ridiculous, $15/day just for parking? If you can avoid all the extra fees the resort is well worth it, but watch out for all the phone charges, food and all the little services that will add up. In summary, the Rio Mar is a great place to relax and still have all the wonders of Puerto Rico close to you but you have to have a car, the tours are a bit overpriced from the resort itself. As expected, the price for amenities isn't really worth it, but if you can avoid all the extra charges you'll probably be happy with the overall price of your stay. The nightlife doesn't really exist and you're too far from San Juan to go clubbing or bar hopping, so party-goers you may want to stay closer to metropolitan San Juan. But if you're looking for a nice vacation with your significant other or family, this is the perfect getaway!", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cLovely location, relaxing trip\u201d", "Author": "ksinging", "ReviewID": "UR26880545", "Content": "First, let me put this review in context. I travel OFTEN for work. I generally stay in middle to upper end hotel chains such as Marriott, Renaissance, Hilton, Wyndham, Westin. My fiance and I booked this trip through CheapCarribean and were satisfied with the booking process and the deal that we got (which included airfare and hotel). The Rio Mar is a beautiful property, the prices are comparable to other hotels in this category and we found the service to be excellent. Experiences we enjoyed: 1) Dancing under the stars on our first evening out by the Tiki Bar and firepit. We started a small trend because two other couples joined in the dancing. 2) Dining at La Parilla (one of the kioskas on the way to Luquillo). The grilled seafood platter was excellent. 3) Hiking in El Yunque 4) Dining at the Las Vegas Restaurant (on the way back from El Yunque). Lovely interior, good service and GREAT bread pudding! 5) Kayaking in the bioluminescent bay (booked through the concierge with Enchanged Island Eco Tours) 6) Dining at Antojitos (down the road from the hotel property--at the intersection of Rte. #3. I highly recommend the fried whole red snapper. 7) Sitting by the adult pool and on the beach. Walking on the beach. If you face the ocean, turn left and walk about 1/3 of a mile, there is a great view of a river that goes in to the ocean with El Yunque in the background. Great photo op. 8) Mimosas on the balcony, gazing at the rain forest Our room was just fine--quite a bit more spacious than the Courtyard Marriott we stayed at by the airport the night before we left Baltimore. We did rent a fridge ($25) and filled it with water purchased at the Wal-Mart in Fajardo. Buy some wine at the grocery located in the same shopping center. We took turns going down to the coffee shop to purchase pastries and coffee in the morning. Ate two dinners and two lunches at the hotel.

We decided on PR. We also decided to stay at the \"Rio Mar\" because we were looking for a resort with a big pool and a beach. We did not rent a car, for the sole purpose of this trip was relaxation. The \"Rio Mar\" is about a 40-45 minutes drive from the San Juan Airport. We took a private shuttle, \"Travel With Padin\" (www.enchanted-isle.com/padin/) that cost us $32.50 per person, one way. The hotel itself has a shuttle service also, but they charge $37.50 per person, one way. We opted for the private shuttle, for they are waiting for you right outside the airport & no waiting for other passengers, for the \"Rio\" picks up several people at the same time. So, we were able to get to the hotel way before the \"Rio's\" shuttle even left the airport! Like other reviews have said, the \"Rio Mar\" is far away from anything. We did not rent a car, and expected to pay big money for food on the resort. You should expect such things in any resort or any island, Im thinking. A Hambuger was $12.00, and frozen drink was $10.00. Lunch for my husband and I was always in the vicinity of around $50.00.....for lunch! But, the resort was beautiful, the grounds beautiful, and all the pictures posted are true & accurate. The beach isn't great. It is VERY windy, the sand is hard-packed and brown and the water not that crystal-clear aqua color that the carribbean is most famous for. But, the water was warm, warmer, at times, than the outside air. I even went into the water to warm up! But, because it is VERY windy, the waves were hugh. Great for adults, not so great if you have little ones. Very dangerous! A Rip Tide carried a little girl out! She had to be rescued by her father and a lifeguard. They do have iguana feedings everyday at 11am. Definitely do that! The iguana's are free to roam (wild), and will eat lettuce right from your hand. They have even been known to \"fall\" from a palm tree into the pool below. Watch your heads! They will also walk under your chaise lounge, but not bother you unless you bother them. The restaurants on site are expensive and proper attire must be warm. No shorts! Pants only. There is a casual, sit yourself, open-air restaurant (Richie's cafe) up the street from the \"Rio Mar\" that offers a free shuttle service to their restaurant and back. The food is ok, and just as expensive. It is atop of a mountain, so if going at night, bring a sweater for the breeze brings down the temp quite a bit. But the view is amazing! The pool area is great. Never had a problem finding a chaise lounge. But, if you want a prime spot by the pool with an umbrella, then get out there by 9-10am. But, if you dont care about sitting close to the pool, and don't care about getting an umbrella, then sleep in! Also, there is a \"Adult Only\" pool. Those loungers fill up quickly, for it is smaller than the \"Activity\" Pool. It is also much quieter at the \"Adult Pool\". But, my husband & I still sat out by the \"activity Pool\" to people watch. At the \"Adult\" pool, everyone kept to themselves and it was like I was in a library or a church! But, at the bigger \"Activity\" pool, the kids talked to you, the adults drank and talked. The pools are right next to one another so you can technically swim at either pool, as long as your 18+. But, I opted to sit by the activity pool, and swam at the \"Adult Pool\".

Overall, this hotel should be rated a 5-star hotel. This is because of the clenliness of the hotel, the quality of their beach, and the overall location of this hotel. I will start with the good things. First, the hotel is in a great location. It is just a short drive away to the el yuncay rainforest (a great time if you hapen to go and it is worth it.) When you go to the front desk of the hotel, they will give you a map if you ask and this will be a map of the rain forest. you want to get to the rainforest early and drive up the road( do not wait until 9:00 when the visitor center opens and all of the tourist busses leave, the big tree trail is the best and make sure to pack a bag with a bathingsuit because you can swim in the waterfall at the end of the trail. the actuall rainforest opens at 7:30). Also, the hotel is right on the beach, and relatively close to the ferry you take to the biolumanessent bay. It is also close to snokling and many other fun activities. Next, on the good list is the pool and outdoor activities at the actuall resort. They offer many great things to do and the beach has great body surfing waves. There is also a sandbar within kayaking distance and you can rent kayaks there. You will want to reserve a day to stay at the hotel's beach and pool place. Also, The rooms have a great view. Now the bad. The hotel's beach is on an underwater sandbar, wich makes for a STRONG riptide in the marked areas. This however, also makes for big waves on the rest of the beach. Other than that, the pool deck is a little slippery I guess. Overall, the hotel is a great value for your manoey and i guarantee that you il be satisfied.

We only ate out once a day (dinner) and snacked in our room. Get a fridge for 25 bucks (one time fee). 4. Rent a car at the airport. There is so much to see but the resort is fairly isolated and it is costly to get taxi's etc. 5. Use valet parking. It costs a little more but is worth the price. 6. Book your excursions directly. We went diving directly out of Fajardo and saved money. 7. Don't be afraid of roadside food stands. Great food for little money. 8. Put yourself in an \"island\" state of mind. Puerto Ricans have a relaxed pace of life. Enjoy the waiting, don't stress about it. 9. Understand that islanders \"drive with their horns\". Honking at you is not malicious or personal..they are just saying \"I am here!\". ...and last, kindness and courtesy is rewarded with similar behavior. Be kind, patient and tip well.

While it is slightly less luxe than a true 5 star resort, it probably has everything you want. The resort itself is beautiful, set on a very large private expanse of land, inside a guarded gate. The golf course is right there, and there are rental villas surrounding it. The hotel itself is down at the bottom of the hill, directly on the ocean, set amidst very pretty grounds. We were upgraded to an ocean-front room on checking in, which had a beautiful view, but the mountain view rooms are great, too, because the rainforest is pretty. The resort is a solid 35 minute drive east of San Juan. I definitely recommend renting a car, or else you will truly be stuck at the resort. Pay the $15 parking fee, and eat out for a few meals - you'll still end up saving money, plus you can get around the island so easily. The rainforest is a 10 minute drive and parking is free. Going back into Old San Juan is easy and parking there is easy and cheap. We also went horseback riding at Hacienda Caribaldi - $90 per person through the hotel, $30 per person if you just go there on your own! The room was a bit small, but has a good-sized balcony and a nice bathroom. The Wyndham beds are great - soft linens, nice comforters and pillows. Plenty of room for 2 people in a room, although 4 in a standard double room would be crowded. The rooms have coffee makers and each morning you'll get coffee, tea bags, and 2 bottles of water. The pools at the hotel are so nice you may not make it to the beach. There are two pools, both large and freeform, with palm trees surrounding and plenty of lounge chairs. The activity pool is for families, and they have some occasional resort activities here (water aerobics, water volleyball.) We spent most of our time at the adult pool, which has really luxurious teak loungers with thick blue cushions. You can rent cabanas for $125 a day, but who needs one - finding chairs under the partial shade of a swaying palm tree is easy enough. The beach, when you do get there, is lovely. It is wide and long - you can walk for about a mile in both directions along a quiet, peaceful stretch of sand. There are no other hotels within walking distance here. The water can be rough, and when we were there the undercurrent was strong, and there were no water sports during those days. But the moment you walk onto the beach, the friendly staff will set up lounge chairs and an umbrella wherever you like. Waitresses patrol the beach and pool all day to bring you drinks and lunch. The food at the resort was generally very good, although pricey. Lunch prices at the Seabreeze or Tiki Bar aren't so bad, about $8-12 for a sandwich or salad. We ate at Palio, the Italian restaurant, and thought it was a bit formal and stuffy for a tropical island (and a young couple). The food was good, but pricey. We also ate at Marbella for dinner, the International restaurant, and the food was good and more reasonably priced. You can see all the restaurant menus on the Wyndham's own website, if you want to browse. The breakfast buffet is way overpriced at $20. Go to the bakery up the street (Isamar, I think) and get coffee and delicious pastries for about $1.50 each Best resort tip: Every day there is a drink special from the Tiki Bar - a special cocktail at $6.50 each, instead of the $10 that all other cocktails are. Make sure to ask for it!! The casino is small and unimpressive, if you're used to Vegas or even Mohegan Sun. There is live music at the bar every night, which is lovely, but subdued.

The physical grounds are beautiful, but everything needs updating. The rooms have holes in the walls and the bathrooms need a major facelift. Shower door didnt close properly. The furniture is shabby and needs replacing. The best part of the hotel is the housekeeping staff who seriously cater to all needs. We went on an extended family vacation with kids and grandkids. There were 2 pools- adult pool and kids pool. The adult pool had comfortable chaises but we couldnt sit there as it was for adults only. We wanted to be with our grandkids, so we sat by the kids pool. Unfortunately, the chaises there were woven wood- they defied you to sit on them for any period of time! The hotel would not allow cushions on the chaises at the kids pool, so adults there spent the time being uncomfortable. RIDICULOUS! If they were afraid cushions would be ruined, they certainly could have given cushions to the adults, and towels for the children! The chaises were butt numbing and back breaking without cushions. Since one spends most of the time by the pool, this was a major turn off! The manager of the hotel did nothing when told that one of the grandparents was in such pain from the chaises that they had to remain in the hotel room. The manager refused to allow a cushioned chaise by the kids pool, despite the obvious disomfort and pain the wood chaise caused a guest of the hotel! We had several suites, but the hotel was not accommodating, when it came to making us comfortable by the pool. In fact, the first time I went to complain about this, the manager didnt even come out to speak with me. When I went back again, and demanded to speak with her, she offered a vinyl blow up mattress that one uses in the pool, to place on the chaise! Unless one is in the water, a vinyl pool mattress is NOT a solution! We would never consider going back to a hotel that wasnt into guest comfort! The food, sadly, was awful :( Dont even think about going to the Italian Restaurant at the hotel- inedible is a major understatement!) The hotel is really not close to anything, so food in an area like this is important. They need to replace all their chefs, and start again as there is no such thing as a good dinner, at this hotel. Since the various restuarants at the hotel share the same kitchen, service is extremely slow! We had a suite, which had a phenomonal layout, and the view was honestly nothing short of spectaular. The balcony was a nice size, as well! The setting is one of the most beautiful settings I have been to, in Puerto Rico, but they seriously need to do some major redecorating and get those bathrooms updated. If they really want people to come to this hotel, they need to update, provide COMFORTABLE chaises by the kids pool (adults do not leave kids to swim by themselves, without watching them) and do something about the awful food and service. Properly redone, this hotel would blow the Ritz out of the water. The beach is nicer, and the suites actually have a very very beautiful ocean view, where as the Ritz suites only overlook the pool, unless one is willing to shell out over $3000 a night for an ocean view suite (and there are only 3 of them, there). If I am going to vacation, I would like to be able to see the oean!

The hotel features a large beach next to a part of the Ocean that is relatively calm and good to swim in. This property has 2 medium-sized swimming pools and a sad excuse for a water side. The smaller of the 2 pools is reserved for adults only and is hardly ever swam in. The regular rooms at this resort are about the size of a room at a typical Motel 6, however, the rooms have 2 comfortable queen-sized beds, a balcony, and a flat-screen TV with a 35 cable channels. The service at the Rio Mar is not particularly good nor particularly bad. Food at the Rio Mar is some of the best resort fare around, but it comes at a ridiculous price. This hotel is good, exept for one MASSIVE drawback. This drawback is the fact that EVERYTHING at this hotel is hugely overpriced. A bowl of cereal is $6! A skirt steak $47! It's not just the overpricing that makes this hotel a 2 out of 5, it's the feeling that the hotel is trying to squeeze every penny out of the guests. For example, to pay for parking, instead of letting guests pay at the parking lot exit, like any other resort would do, guests must walk for over 5 minutes to a in-hotel paystation. There are 2 reasons why the hotel does this: 1. To engourage guests to not bother with the hassel of leaving and paying their parking fee, thus allowing the hotel to continue making money on the parked car, and forcing the guest to spend their money at the hotel and not elsewhere. 2. To encouarage guests to valet park their car at a rate of a whopping $30 per day! This money-snatching attitude is what makes this hotel a 2 out of 5. The rest of this resort is really quite good. If the Wyndham Rio Mar were more fairly priced and didn't have such a money grabbing attitude, I would rate it a 4 out of 5, but this problem is such a huge drawback that really sours this resort.

We did rent a fridge for $25 from the front desk, which was plenty big. We ate out for dinner each night, but it was nice to have a fridge for breakfast and lunch. There were 2 pools (one for adults only) and 2 hot tubs. There was also a tiki bar near the pool with food and beverages. The hotel is right on the beach, and the view from our room was amazing. The concierge at the hotel was extremely helpful. Nathaniel and Noel were our two favorites. Whatever you need to know, they can help assist you. They even ordered pizza for us from a local pizzeria because neither of us spoke spanish. While we were there, we did take the timeshare tour. Even though we did not purchase, it is definitely worth hearing what they had to say. We weren't in a position to buy yet, but they give you a gift for taking the tour and they are not into pressuring you! We would definitely recommend renting a car while you are there. You do have to pay $15/day to park (or $20/day valet) but it was nice to come and go as you please. We rented through enterprise on hotwire.com and they were awesome. Very organized! We paid $130/6 days. Good deal! As far as what to do...there is plenty. While we were there, we hiked the rainforest (5 min drive from hotel); went to Luquillo Beach (10 min drive from hotel); toured Old San Juan (30-40 min drive from hotel depending on traffic); went to Fajardo (East on hotel on Rt 3) and did the bioluminescent bay tour with Kayaking Puerto Rico (www.kayakingpuertorico.com) which was awesome!! (25 min drive from hotel); and obviously just relaxed at the Wyndham. One thing about the rainforest, the signs will tell you how far the hike is, but my husband and I usually could do it in about half the amount of time, and we are not experienced hikers. As for food, the first night we ate at Marbella at the Wyndham. The food was good and it wasn't terribly expensive. All the other restaurants in the hotel are a bit more expensive and they have a dress code. We took advantage of the Kioscos right off Route 3. There are a 30+ to choose from. As you leave the resort, go east (left) on route 3. They will be on the left hand side. Great prices and great food. Definitely go to El Jefe #12 and La Parilla #2.

When we landed we picked up our rental car and drove to the hotel. The ride is only about 40 minutes (however if you take the toll road 66 you will probably bypass a lot of the lights on Rte 3). We are By Request Members so upon check in we were upgraded to a junior suite. The room itself was nice. It was large with a seating area, very clean, and had a nice bathroom. Of course some things could have been nicer - large crack in the ceiling of the bathroom, mini fridge should have been cleaned better etc. The grounds of the hotel are very nice. The grounds staff really works hard on the property. The pools are a bit small compared to other resorts we have stayed at but we are more ocean people so it didn't bother us too much. We did rent a cabana one day on along the pool. Definitely worth the $150 comfy chairs, plenty of towels, cooler with water, snacks, fruit plate, and designated waitstaff. The beach was great. Very clean, lots of chairs, warm water, and plenty of room. The ocean did have some strong waves while we were there but that just kind of made it more fun. You could stay in the shallow area, or body surf in the big waves, or just hang out in between. After reading other reviews we decided we didn't want to eat at the restaurants on property we wanted to experience Puerto Rico's food. The only exceptions to that was our breakfasts we went to the ERL next to the casino for coffee and pastries and we tried the appetizers at Boleros lounge and the lobby bar. We ate dinners at Antojitos (on the road to the rio mar) - they have delicious food and great staff. We also tried La Parilla (Kiosk #2 at luquillo beach) - great food as well. For lunch one day we tried Richies - the food was good but you could tell it was a little more touristy. We did try a non Puerto Rican meal one night because it was so recommended. We went to the Sushi Boat in Fajardo. A must try is the Tempura Shrimp Roll - delicious! A must do is driving to San Juan for a day of sightseeing or shopping but take the scenic route. Take Rte 3 west to Rte 187. The road takes you through Rio Grande but then you head along the coast through Loiza, and Pinones. There are some great small beaches, sand dunes, and picture perfect stops along the way. In San Juan we had tapas at el picoteo in the El Convento hotel (our favorite San Juan hotel) - the tapas were our favorite meal - simple and delicious! We did encounter a few problems with the hotel. The first is the drink prices. I know it's a resort and I have no problem with marked up drinks but I will say the Wyndham is definitely at the top of the higher prices. $10 for a mojito or a capirinha is definitely over priced considering the only alcohol in it is rum or cachaca and it was not premium liquor (I don't qualify Bacardi as premium especially when it's local). The next problem is the pool side restaurant. We stopped in twice and everytime it was closing. One day it had literally been open for an hour and a half. On the last day of our vacation we finally received a document detailing when restaurants should be open and what activities should be happening - would have been nice to get this the first day of our stay though. I know that Wyndham really wants to sell their vacation property so okay they have sales people at the towel hut so every time you go there they ask you if you're interested. That was fine with us didn't bother us at all. Then we tried to use the conceirge - big problem! We originally booked with EGBH sailing but the Captain was sick and in the hospital so they had to cancel. We tell the conceirge our problem and ask them to help us with finding a private sailing tour. First thing they say is probably not a private one - is this not a resort, do you not have contacts on the island? The second thing they say is have you been asked about joining our breakfast to learn more about our property. I finally give them my name and room number and ask them to contact us with the information about tours (even with other people) - not once did they contact us all week.

They replenish the coffee every morning and you can get a fridge for $25 for the week. The Iguanas can't climb down so they fall from the palm trees into the pool, freaks you out unless you know. Casino \u00e2\u20ac\u201c smaller than we thought. No craps, but they do have blackjack($5 minimum), roulette, slots, etc. Check the website. Everyone in our group won one good slot play for the week. Golf \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the course looks beautiful, but we did not play as it was $200 per round. Too steep for us. Restaurants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As mentioned, they are on the expensive side, but this is a resort, not the Holiday Inn. The Grill Pub was fun, casual, and less expensive than the Grill Room. Drinks are about $10 each and beer $6. - Isamar Bakery, just down the street on 3, is great for breakfast. Try the oatmeal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is not yo mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oatmeal. Very creamy and sweet. The breakfast sandwiches are $4 and two people can share one. You can also get a cup of coffee for 65 cents. - Brass Cactus, Luquillo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c OK if you like US restaurants. The food was good, but it looked like Bostons in Delray Beach. - Lolitas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c OK for Mexican. I have had better, but it is close and you can depend on a good meal. Get your Margarita with ice on the side. They have a Valet, but you can park yourself. - King Seafood, Luquillo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Local no nonsense place. Locals will get served ahead of the gringos. But the food is decent. - Richies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Right up the hill from the resort. Hey, he is a friendly guy, but his prices reflect the resort. Very cool(literally) place to have a drink. - Faccios Pizza \u00e2\u20ac\u201c close to the airport, but worth the trip. Make sure you get specific directions. It is across the street (Hwy 3) from Costco. Great place to hit on your way home from Old San Juan. - Palio \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The food and service is pretty good and a bit high on costs. Especially if you have a few cocktails/wine/beer. Surrounding Area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We rented a car from Charlies. Brand new mini-van at a good price. If you do not want to stay at the resort entirely, you will need a car. There is not much local flavor that you can patronize without a sense of why am I here. The whole island is sadly very poor with lots of wrought iron on everything. The police wear their flack jackets on the outside and they cruise the streets with their flashing lights on. We found most of the locals polite but if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like mainlanders, they claimed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno speaka da english\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. - Walmart \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hated to go there but had to. It is a few miles east towards Fajardo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth a trip on your first day for water, snacks, beer, pop, etc. Not a full grocery, but there is a grocery store in the same mall. Do not be shocked to see the guard tower in the middle of the parking lot. Try the mini donuts outside. - Condom World (yes, that is the name)\u00e2\u20ac\u201c next to Lolitas. Open till midnight except on Sundays. - Culebra Island - $5 round trip 1 \u00c2\u00bd hour ferry ride. Great beaches and OK snorkeling. Bring everything you can with you. Snorkel gear - $12.50 a set at the port. Jeep on the island - $45 for the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you will need one or get stuck at one beach. The dogs that keep the birds out of the ferry terminal were fun to watch. - Palmas Del Mar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drove by there. Looked fab but did not go into the area. - El Yunque \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the rainforest. Lots to see, the falls are great, but no wildlife. Saw a few geckos, and a few butterflies, but nothing else. Great views of the east side of the island. - Old San Juan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lots to see and do. The forts are pretty cool. Shopping is just like everywhere. Get in a checker game by the ports. - El Conquistador \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looked like a top notch resort. Had a chicken sandwich and two beers for $40 with tip.

We booked this trip through Costco travel, and bought a package including daily breakfast, airport transfers, and 25% discount on resort activities. The primary benefit of going through Costco was their knowledge of the vacation packages offered by the hotel. Costco, Expedia and other large travel agencies use Elegant Steering for their airport transfers. Elegant uses late model nine passenger vans, however we were the only passengers going to and from the airport. Elegant's personnel were all very professional, and helped us at the airport in San Juan when Northwest Airlines lost one of our checked bags. ( The bag was delivered the next morning to the hotel.) ACCOMODATIONS We had a room on the 5th floor of the West wing of the hotel with a beautiful ocean view. The room was nicely appointed (flat screen TV, etc.) and the king bed was very comfortable. There were some stains on the carpet in the hallway leading to our room, but fortunately this general condition was not duplicated in the hotel room. What was disconcerting, however, were the paper thin walls separating the rooms, allowing us to hear every word emanating from the family with young children staying in the room adjacent to us. Rather than complaining, I simply turned up the volume on the television which masked much of the noise coming from next door. DINING The Breakfast buffet in the Marbella restaurant was included in our rate plan, and it was well worth it. The buffet has most the foods one would expect to see, including a station for eggs and waffles. The food quality and preparation and service was good. Although on two or three days I was charged for the buffet even though it was included in my rate plan. So check your bill! For lunch, we ordered from the Tiki Bar at the pool. We found the chicken and fish grilled sandwiches to be of tasteful and well prepared. Sandwiches run $12 to $16 and mixed drinks $10, exclusive of tax and tips. There were only two full service restaurants at the resort open during our stay, other than Marbella which we did not go to. Palio is a very good Italian restaurant where we dined twice. Expect to spend $120 for two. I would specailly recommend the caprese salad. We also dinner at the Grille Room, an upscale steak restaurant. The food and the service were good, but be prepared to spend $80 per person. If you choose to leave the resort to eat, and you don't have your own transportation, expect to pay $30 for a taxi to the closest town, Luqiillo. Richies is a restaurant on a hill overlooking the ocean about 5 minutes form the hotel. If you call them, they will send a complimentary van to pick you up and return you to the hotel. The food at Richies is good, especially the skirt steak, and less expensive than the hotel. We would also recommend La Parrilla in Luquillo. AMENITIES and RECREATION The adult pool is a great place to spend a relaxing afternoon. Iguanas hang out there, and occasional dive bomb into the pool! Don't worry, they are not aggressive. We had no problem getting good lounge chairs, but the hotel was not even remotely full. Cabanas can be rented, but cost a whopping $125 per day. If you like to be on the beach, I don't think you'll be disappointed. The sand is nice and soft, and the surf is great for body surfing. The tennis facility is excellent, and if you ask, the manger will attempt to arrange a game for you. I played golf one day on the River course. The course was in good condition, although it played very soft due to recent rains. The Ocean course was closed on the day I played because of water.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t venture into San Juan at all. We were basically looking for a hotel with a nice beach/pool that was close to the east coast. The hotel was about a 45 minute drive east of the airport. Check-in: We had a room for Jan 18-21. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book the room directly through Wyndham, but I called ahead of time to see if I could get an upgrade and they put a note on my reservation. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were upgraded to a junior suite facing the rainforest. I told the front desk I was a Wyndham rewards member (I signed up for this on the advice of other reviewers) and was upgraded to an oceanfront suite. Parking: Self-parking was $15/day. Before exiting the parking garage, take the parking ticket to the valet in the front of the hotel to get it validated so that you can exit the garage. Looking at another review it looks like you may be able to get free parking if you go to the casino and get it validated. Room: The oceanfront suite was very spacious with a king bed and sofa bed. Everything was very clean. The bathroom however had a very funny smell, almost like the ocean, but a little dirtier. It was bearable and we were hardly in the hotel room, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother complaining about the smell. The toilet also clogged but they promptly unclogged it after we reported it. We also got a service follow-up call from the hotel to make sure the toilet issue was taken care of. Wyndham rewards also sent up a drinks and candy the day the toilet was fixed. The toiletries were the Bath and Body Works Blue line. The only real complaint we had was the humidity that made it very difficult to air dry swimsuits. There was also nightly turndown service and they left chocolates on our bed. In-room Phone: Some phone numbers with area code 787 are considered long distance. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know this since the phone says to dial long distance you need to dial a 1 first. So when we received our bill, they charged us $2/min for phone calls totaling $18. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheaper to call on your cellphone if you have Verizon. Upon checkout, I told them I disagreed with the charge and explained why and they were very accommodating and removed the charges. Resort Fee: We were charged a resort fee of ~$18 per day. The auction site we booked through didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover this charge. Beach/ Pool/Hot tub: The waves were pretty rough. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really go in the water at all except to dip our feet. We saw kite surfers jumping around though. The pool was a little on the cold side, but it was still nice to go in and it was clean. The hot tub was a little dirty as it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have a working filter. You can get towels at the cabana free of charge, just tell them your room number. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a good idea to get towels here if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning on doing any water activities outside of the hotel. Hotel Internet: There are 5 or 6 computer hubs on the lobby floor with free internet. Some computers even have skype on them so you can call long distance if you bring your headphones. No printers though. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also free internet in-room if you sign up for Wyndham rewards. Food: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel. We had a car and went to Isamar bakery almost every day, we tried Antojitos one night, and La Parilla in the Luquillo kiosks. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a Walgreens on Route 3 east not too far from the hotel where you can get water and snacks for cheap. We also saw lot of fast food places like Mc Donalds, Burger King, KFC, Subway. See my reviews on the food for more info. Car Rental: We reserved a car through Enterprise for about $20/day so that we could do all the activities/excursions we wanted to. We also added on the loss damage waiver for an extra $19/day and we were glad we did since a lot of the drivers came about an inch from hitting us and potholes were everywhere. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a place near Enterprise that has great empanadas if you are looking for good food once you land. Excursions: El Yunque was very close to our hotel and we only stayed there for less than two hours. We actually drove up further than we needed to and walked the trail south toward la Mina falls. We also did the Bio-bay kayaking with Akuaadventures. It was $45/pp plus tax. It was fairly easy to get to Las Croabas Park (the meeting site for kayaking) from the hotel using the directions from another kayaking company called kayaking puerto rico. You may want to bring a flash light as it can come in handy if you kayak into a mangrove. Flamenco Beach on Culebra Island was probably the best beach I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only been to the beaches in San Diego, and one in Aruba and one in the Bahamas, and this one was by far the best. It was definitely worth the trip, with clear calm waters and white sand. It was also very clean and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very crowded the day we went. The food stands also sold water and tasty empanadas for a dollar or two. The drive from the hotel to the Fajardo port took about 35 minutes and we arrived early around 820. We caught the 9am ferry and had seats outside in the back. The ride took about 1.5 hrs. We then took the Flamenco beach bus shuttle for $3 pp to get to Flamenco beach. It's $2 pp return trip. I would have given the hotel a 5 if it didn't have that horrible bathroom smell.

Folks, why don't you just write what you liked about a resort? Enough whining nonsense about what you didn't like. Who cares about your negative opinion. Focus on the positive and keep it as factual as you can, and if there is nothing positive you have to say, then shut-up and don't write anything. If one person liked the food and another ated it, well the information is totally and unequivocally useless because and therefore, I will have to find out myself. But, if I read a review and only one person commented positively about the food, well that explains more than 5 people saying food is good and 5 people saying it is bad. For example: Do write---Food was fresh and full of flavor. Do not write---Food was terrible. WTF is \"terrible\". Do not write---service was poor or slow. WTF is \"poor or slow.\" Did your freakin bags come off the plane \"fast\"? Was everything else \"slow\", like how long it takes to cook a burger? Did the sun rise too \"slow\" for you?Get a clue on reality and base-line your experience on the way of life in that coutry/location. OK, onto my review... I booked a private villa for a fraction of the cost as a room. Look into it. With a family of 5, it was perfect and there was a full kitchen and laundry machines - packed light and did few loads of laundry. However, we spent most of our time at the resor. Pool is warm and clean. Beach is warm, small waves, and the sand is clean. Plenty of chairs. The food at the outdoor pool grill is fresh, tasteful, and well porportioned for price. The casino is pleasant and I do not gamble, but got free parking if I got my ticket stamped at casino. Heck, I wone $40 on roulet by accident - had no clue what I was doing, but a monkey can figure it out by casual observation. We rented a jeep from Dollar at the airport - that is a must if you want to get out and see the beautiful island. El Yunque is a must and provides an indication that the PR's gives a [--] about their environment. The rain forest is totally free, so money is not their incentive to preserve their treasure. Went to public beach - Luquillo. The water was the warmest, waves were almost non-existent, and the sand clean. We rented chairs and umbrella fr $10. One thing I noticed was the PR people are so nice, polite, and courtious. NO ONE bothered us on the beach to hustle us for anything-never. Went to Fajardo to go on Salty Dog catamaran - Nice pleasant crew, the food was cold cuts and very fresh. Snorkeling on the island was easy enough for my 6 yr old. They gave lessons. Another convenient thing about the area of PR I went to, was they have all the big box stores like Walmart and Walgreens to fullfill any needs. We also bought from local vendors as well. I will definitely go back to PR and the kids are still whining about going back this year 2009 (I wrote this late).

Air from Chicago and 7 nights for $2100 and change. Fantastic deal and the hotel provided us with still more value. We were upgraded for free to a Junior Suite overlooking the ocean. We figure we saved about $5000 over retail booking. Here's a summary of our experience: - The resort is beautiful, the people friendly, the concierge will do just about anything for you, .... It is also quite empty right now so you have the place to yourself. Maybe more service staff than customers. No lines, great service. - Join the Wyndham Club and tell them you if you are celebrating a special event. I believe that was what got us the free upgrade when some others have not been successful. - The trade winds make the beach a sometimes very windy place. Move to the pool area or better yet plan for beaching it at Luquillo beach, just minutes away and in a protected cove. You can buy tropical drinks and rent two lounge chairs and an umbrella for the day for $20. - The hotel is nicely centered for active people who want to see some of the beautiful natural areas and also visit cities and towns. San Juan is 45 minutes west, a nature reserve is 30 minutes east, and a tropical rainforest (El Yunque) and large national park is 20 minutes south. - Rent a car. If you plan accordingly, you can miss the main traffic hours and get around pretty easily. We did not find driving that bad and you save a lot of money over taxis and hotel tours. Alternatively, the resort offers many bus tours to San Juan and the other local attractions. These are pricey though when compared to driving yourself. - It rains sporadically here. The resort is near El Yunque (a sizable mountain range and tropical rainforest). Come to grips with it or don't stay there. - Plan to eat at some of the fabulous local restaurants and eat local food. The resort food was ordinary. El Bohio near Cabezas de San Juan, and Antojitos and Don Pepe near the hotel were excellent. We hear the Parrot Club in Old San Juan is a \"must do\", though we did not get a chance to try it. - Remember: You are 45 minutes from San Juan. This resort is not in a city. You are pretty remotely located (though with amenities such as a spa and golf). The beach is windy. I suggest planning for transportation (a car or budgeting for side trips). - The resort will nickel and dime you, but this should not be an issue if you book through a discount agency like we did. Parking is $15-20 per day, wireless internet was (if I recall) $20 a day in your room, a fridge for the Junior Suite was a one-time $25 charge, and drinks were $10+ dollars each.

When the supervisor came he expressed suprise that we were in the room as the front desk knew the room had problems. Two nights at dinner it took 60 minutes for appetizers to come.

We had 3 t.v.'s and all the laundry facilities. The condo was fully stocked with all the necessary laundry and cleaning supplies as well as a kitchen stocked with all the supplies you could need to cook a gourmet meal. It was super clean and quiet! We rented a car which is a total necessity. The condo came with a golf cart which was a convenient way to get to the beach. The beach and pools of the hotel are 3/4 mile away from the condo but it is a lovely walk or an easy golf cart ride. There is so much to do on the island of Puerto Rico.

We rented bicycles and cycled on the boardwalk in Pinones. We saw a professional Puerto Rican baseball game in Carolinas. We kayaked in the Bio Bay in Fajardo. We spent a day on Luquillo Beach. Everything exceeded our expectations! We can't wait to go back. The grocery store is just down the street. It has exotic choices as well as our recognized brands. We felt very safe.

We travel quite a bit and have a lot of hotels/resorts to compare it to and although the rooms themselves could use some updating, we all agreed that the Rio Mar is great and would recommend it to anyone. The resort is located in a gated community with nice grounds, which allowed for a nice areas to roam around outside (which is especially nice if you like to walk/run like we do). From check-in to check-out we experienced the wonderful service that the Rio Mar has to offer. I will say, you do pay for it as there is a 14% service fee tacked on to the bill at the end of your stay, but at least we felt like we got what we paid for. Every staff person we walked by greeted us, employees (especially Angel) were always available at the beach to help us get chairs or set up an umbrella, the towel hut staff gladly switched our our damp towels for fresh ones when needed, and the valet provided us with cold water at the front door when we got back from our morning walks/runs. We did eat most of our meals on site at the resort and very much enjoyed both of our dinners at Palios (exceptional service too!) and Shimas. The breakfast buffet at Marbella was a treat one morning as well. We enjoyed the convenience of being able to get a quick bagel or muffin at ERL (near the lobby) and both Seabreeze and the Tiki Bar provided delicious lunches while overlooking the beach or pool as well as good service. As far as price, we didn't find the prices particularly high, especially since we were at a resort, but as I said, we do travel a lot and perhaps are used to resort prices. The area that the resort is in itself is perfect. A short 35-45 min car ride to Old San Juan and less than 15 minutes to the El Yunque rain forest. My recommendation would be to rent a car because you can easily drive and navigate yourself around the rain forst. The staff at the rain forest visitor center was most helpful in pointing us in the right direction of trails and waterfalls. A visit to Old San Juan is also worth the trip - the streets are nice to walk through as well as a visit to the fort. If you are looking for a wonderful meal - try DragonFly! The Rio Mar is a perfect place for families, or couples too! It is not overwhelmingly big but big enough. There were many families with kids there, however there is also an adult pool if you want to relax without a lot of kids running around. I also have never been to a beach with so many chairs! Overall the Rio Mar is a wonderful place for a vacation and Puerto Rico is the perfect spot for a mix of relaxation and activity in nice weather!", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cNot Sure I Would Go Again ...\u201d", "Author": "ReadytoGoNyc", "ReviewID": "UR23244220", "Content": "I have never been so happy to return from holiday -ever !

The caulking around the tub in our bathroom was also mildew-ridden...something that could be easily taken care of if the facility cared about getting rid of it. The staff was less than accomodating, here's why: Dinners took at least 2 hours to get through because of the slowness; the waiters were flat-out rude to us...gave us attitude when we needed to split the bill up a couple of different ways; I ordered a steak cooked medium-well and it came back raw with red meat dripping out the inside (the waitress was so scarce to come back to the table after the food came, that I ate what I could of the steak and left the rest...the waitress asked how our meal was and I told her how raw my steak was and she looked like she could care less...never even offered to right the matter!!!); One of the first nights we were there, we went to the casino around 1:30 AM to play blackjack...we asked for a couple of drinks since it was advertised to be open until at least 2 AM...they starting rambling off in Spanish to each other and then refused to give us drinks...we took our money chips off the table and got up to leave since they seemed to not care about our business and they flat out MOCKED us as we walked out of the casino!!! They were making fun of us so bad, that we refused to spend any money in their casino for the whole rest of the trip. After that incident we went to the front desk to complain and they said that they could not help us at all because the casino was under different management than the rest of the hotel...we told them that the manager was the one mocking us in the first place!!! The front desk promised to call us to settle the matter and NEVER DID!; On the beach they have some umbrellas set up for guests to use, but you have to stay in the middle of everyone and cannot take your umbrella past a certain palm tree (we tried to use an umbrella where our family was set up, which, mind you, was still DIRECTLY in front of the resort!!! and they were quick to come and snatch it up); every day on the beach it would rain for about 10-15 minutes and people would scurry for cover...while most people scurried, we usually ended up staying put...which gave us ample times to see the hotel beach crew shaking out towels to see what people had left behind...we saw them take someone's sunglasses, and who knows what else...they looked like they were scavenging for items that people left behind!!!; The prices of drinks were OUTRAGEOUS! So expensive that we took a $20 cab ride down the street to buy beer because at the resort they were $6 per beer, mixed drinks were $10+ and if you asked for an extra shot, they charged an extra $5; The lunch menus at all the restaurants only carried the same things, so we ended up eating turkey clubs and chicken fajitas the whole week for lunch because they were the only things on the menu we could find that we liked; Overall, the staff was un-accomodating, and for the money that we spent there, we expected 5-Star service, which was nothing close to what we got.

You will need it and there are some great places to go and see (Old San Juan, El Yunque Rain Forest, etc). There is free parking outside the villa - a huge bonus to the large hotel where they charge at least $20 a day. We found 2 fantastic local restaurants. Antojito's, down the bottom of the street (of the main hotel entrance) and a fantastic local terrace restaurant at up the top of the same street. This one has great views!

Upgraded from standard room to \"Ocean View\" for extra $50 per person. The deal was the best part. The most annoying part of the trip was the constant sales pitch by people throughout the resort to buy into their \"Vacation Experiences Packages\"... essentially time shares with Wyndham. If it was once at check in, fine. But getting towels at the pool, asking the concierge for assistance with local shopping, and even a trip to the spa all required conversations about why we didn't want to go listen to the formal sales pitch, even if it meant getting a free night's stay or spa credit. We would rather have done without the need to justify why we don't want to buy time shares once a day. Resort seemed OK, but not that luxurious at all. Maybe it was better when Westin ran the property. We were \"honeymooners\" so they gave us a nice little upgrade to a \"junior suite\" from the \"ocean view\" we had booked as well as a complimentary bottle of decent, but cheap white wine in our room. Nice little touch, I'll admit. Our first room smelled too musky / mildewy to even stay. We transfered to another before even getting our bags delivered. The furniture smelled, even in our second room, of mildew. I guess the humidity just settles into everything. Also, I would have thought that an upgrade from Ocean View to Junior Suite would have still had an Ocean view, but our room couldn't see past the palm trees and pathways just adjacent to the building. The resort was half empty our first few days, but got busy with families toward the end, the week before Christmas. No complaints, just identifying the crowd. Thank god though for the adult only pool. No, not that kind of adult (fortunately, given the crowd). We ate at the Italian restaurant in the hotel, Palio's, on our first night. Food was OK. Pricey, but reasonable for a resort. They clearly made the effort with the food to justify the prices. Nice presentations, good selection to choose from. Being that we're from NYC though, we're used to better food for the prices they charged here. Not a big deal. Key Point! RENT A CAR Better than anything at the resort are the local restaurants you can go to either by cab or by rental car. For the price of the shuttle R/T from the airport, you can rent a car for the week and have lots more freedom. The concierge recommended King Fish (pretty good) and La Parilla (AWESOME!). There are these little roadside strips of restaurants the locals eat at. You may not be adventurous enough to try them, but it's so worth it. For lunch, you can pretty much pick any one and get good cheap Caribbean, Puerto Rican, or Mexican food. We stopped our first day on the way to the resort to one of these little places (a light or two past the resort on Rt 3) for lunch... $20 for 2 Burritos, 2 Beers, and a fried/stuffed plaintain appatizer, just to try it.

This resort is in real trouble. The resort is very pretty and well maintained. But here are the criticisms: 1: We booked a 2 bed room. Upon arrival we were told that they were out of them. Upon my refusal to accept one bed, Miraculously, they found a 2 bedded room. 2: Other than the breakfasts, which were pricey but good, the food was a big disappointment. One major restaurant, Shimas, was closed during the entire stay. The major italian restaurant, Palio was a big disappointment. They charge through the roof for really ordinary food - and at times lousy food. For example, I ordered an Osso Bucco over Risotto. My culinary experience tells me that Risotto should be soft and creamy. This rice was crunchy like nuts. When I complained the waiter infomed me that the chef said the Risotto was properly prepared, crunchy. The other restaurant offered just, average over priced hot dogs, burgers, dry chicken breast concoctions, etc. 3: Shops. I needed some over the counter medicine. And I needed it badly. The sign on the convenience shop listed the hours as 9Am to 11PM. I went down at 9:30 PM and it was locked shut. I went to the desk to complain. They told me that the shop closed at 7PM. When I told them about the sign, at first they did not believe me. I had to go over to the shop and snap a digital photo of it and show it to them. Their answer was that good old shrug of the shoulders. Since I needed the medication, I asked them to shuttle me to the drug store in town. They refused and I had to pay $15.00 for a round trip taxi. 4: Last but not least was the rip-off I discovered upon check out. The night before check out I went to the desk to check my bill. The bill included 5 days parking charges and taxes. I did not have a car. It also included round trip airport shuttle, even though I had prepaid it through Cheap Caribbean. The clerk removed them from the bill. The morning of check out I received an \"Express Checkout\" packet on the floor of my room. I checked it and there again was the $240.00+ charge for parking and airport shuttle. Now I was fortunate that I read the express checkout rather than allow them to just put it through my credit card. There was a large crowd there attending a meeting. The costs were obviously picked up by the expense accounts. I wonder how many of them left with express checkout with those extra charges not checked. Obviously, we will never return to that place.

We just returned from a 1 week stay during Thanksgiving week, went with my husband and 2 small children (ages 5 and 2). This is an excellent resort for families, especially with small children. There is so much for kids to do, from the water slide (which is a huge hit with all of the kids!) to the iguana feeding to the hourly kid-oriented activities (lawn games, relay races, bingo, etc) to the kids club (where you can even just sign out games and balls and beach toys without having to utilize or pay for any of the camp). The beach is right next to the pool area and is very nice (although the sand is a darker color than I'm used to). There are multiple restaurants to choose from, several of which are very family oriented with extensive children's menus ($6 for child entree). But what I think sets this resort apart is the service. This was 5-star service, the type of service I have only encountered once when we stayed at a Four Seasons in Miami. The staff is just exceptional: friendly, helpful, attentive, and just plain nice. I strongly recommend joining the Wyndham By Request Program before you arrive- it's easy to sign up on line, just make sure that you call the hotel ahead of time and let them know to put your BY Request information on your hotel reservation, so they know when you check in. This definitely personalized the service- we received a free room upgrade to an ocean-view (without asking), had our own personal concierge calling us several times during the week to check in and see if we needed anything, and were brought wine and snacks to our room after check-in and the night before check-out. Nice perks. I can't say enough wonderful things about Jesus at the Concierge Desk and his very nice colleague Angel. Both went out of their way to help me with my requests, they are great at making their guests feel special. I also recommend the golf course if you have kids- we took our kids to the driving range and the pitch and putt and got to ride around in golf carts for a while, which was fun! The rooms are very nice, the hotel itself is beautiful, the food is decent (expensive, but nothing out of the ordinary for a 4-star island resort, and you can find more reasonable priced items at Marbella and the Iguana Pub).

Richie's cafe which seems to be very popular with staff and others, is overpriced and average, view from the cafe is good though. Downside of staying @ Rio Mar is that your eating choices outside of the hotel are limited unless you are ready to drive 30 minutes to either San Juan or Fajardo. Would recommend having a rental car unless you plan on staying @ the resort at all times.

The staff was VERY attentive, rooms were clean, housekeeping delivered items quicker than anywhere I've stayed. We went with our 2 kids (12 & 9) the adult pool is great to get away from little ones splashing. My kids LOVED the pool / slide/ iguanas roaming around. The views are lovely. The beach had plenty of chairs, umbrellas and they had sand toys for the kids. The surf was great 5 /7 days we swam. It got rough the last 2 days. We rented a car, went to San Juan, Fajardo, and several other places. Taxi's are very expensive and there is SO much to do here. Just the 2 way trip to /from the airport for 4 people would have been $240. Our rental for the week was less than that. Because of the car we went out to eat every night. LaPerilla #2 kioskos is great, Richies, several others close by but not walkable. We rented a fridge for the room ($25) week) went to Amigos & Walmart to stock up and saved a TON of money on beer, rum, OJ, cereal, ect...) the breakfast buffet in the hotel is $20 day. A bowl of cold cereal is $7. Beer is $7, rum drinks $10+ each... We went horseback riding, took a snorkle trip through East Wind Adventures (awesome crew/ food/ snorkle trip to Little Palmino) went to the rain forest, Old San Juan for a day and generally just drove around the eastern part of Puerto Rico. A few things: take cash for gasoline, cash for the rain forest, people drive a bit aggressive - not one person used a blinkerthat I saw. Most people speak english. Be at the airport AT LEAST 1 hr prior to your departure, trust me...we got stuck in a bit of traffic and got to the airport with 50 minutes to spare...the flight had closed BUT we still made it on. It was a real hassle :-) Do not be afraid of the roadside food! It is some of the BEST on the island. When you see a broken down bus on the side of the road, pop up tent and grill - STOP or you'll miss some great food! Also have a coco frio while you are there!

We drove to Fajardo one day to take the ferry to Vieques and the hotel is only about a 30 to 40 minute drive from there. I'd highly recommend Vieques. The hotel was a little on the pricey side - especially when they add on resort fees and even a bellboy charge whether you use the bellboy or not. The air conditioning in the public areas meant that the place was a bit chilly to say the least. And when we checked in our keys didn't work and we were given another room eventually.

The grounds, pools, and beach are very well kept. Beach chairs and pool chairs were overly abundant but it was November and the hotel was maybe 75% full. Some reviews talked down the beach, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect crystal blue water with white sand, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more of a fine brown sand but kept very clean by the staff. You will find \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstuff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the water but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s typical seaweed, no signs of jellyfish or other offensive items in the water and I did spend a lot of time body surfing. I definitely recommend a rental car, the money spent on the car will be easily made up in food and excursion savings. Save the $70/person rain forest bus trip and drive yourself. Stop at the El Yunque welcome center for $3/person and get the maps to all the rain forest attractions there. We did the trail to the waterfall with a 7 and 4 year old, took about 30 minutes to get there. We beat the bus trip people by 20 minutes to the water fall and had the area to ourselves with about 5 other people. Once they showed up it got very crowded. If you hike to the water fall take a bathing suit, a towel to dry off, and water. You will not find anything to drink on the way, you must take everything. Rocks are very slippery and I would recommend sandals in the water but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have to hike back with wet sandals. I recommend sneakers for the hike and not a cheap sandal. The Fort San Felipe del Morro in old San Juan was worth the trip, kids thought it was a castle and found it interesting, again save the bus trip and drive there, entry fee was $6/person. IF YOU HAVE A GPS WITH US MAPS, MOST LIKELY PEURTO RICO WILL BE IN THERE !!! We took our Garmin Nuvi 200 and it had everything in it, Rain Forest, del Morro, etc. Food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we typically don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat dinner at hotels because the food is blah and overpriced. We ate out every night with the kids at local restaurants and saved a lot of money. Richie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the top of the hill near the entrance to Rio Mar was good but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a kids menu, they kids ended up splitting a $30 rib plate. Dinners were good and the view was nice. Puerto Rican restaurant where 968 meets route 3 had good food but was very slow, waited about 1 hour for food after we ordered, they operate on local time. Kiosk #2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you take route 3 east towards Luquillo about 2 miles east on the left hand side of the route 3 you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what looks like a long row of shacks and bars. Each one has a number and on a recommendation we ate at kiosk #2, had two fish dishes that were very good with too much food that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finish our plates. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be scared by some of the shacks, some look very rough and shady, just drive by and park in front of the one you want. We found #2 to be clean, friendly and noticed about 4 other families from Rio Mar there. If you like Mexican you must try Lolita\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, it was so good we went back a second time. Food is authentic Mexican and cheap. For example tacos are $1.75 and the 2 burrito plate was $8. Maps and GPS didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the location correct, if you head east on route 3, you must go about 2 miles past downtown Luquillo, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a little strip mall next to Condom World. Parking, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste your time with valet parking, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $30/day and it takes forever to get your car. Do the self park for $15/day. The rooms have the mini bar fridge left in the room but empty. Ours worked so we stocked up at the super market on route 3 and it kept everything cold.

A buffet breakfast for two, with taxes and tip came out to $50. And 50 minute massages, with taxes and tip, were $150.

The cappucino colored sand beach was semi-clean ( a lot of straws and buried cups) right in front of the main entrance to the beach but a short distance (yards away) it was very dirty with vegetative debris, broken glass, washed up pots and pans, a guitar, a snorkel and mask and latex gloves. The hotel rented water sports equipment in this area.There is a sign as you enter the sand that you are off hotel property and there are no lifeguards on duty. A local man, 29 yrs old,drowned in that area as we arrived. His pregnant fiance was saved but some people we talked to who were there said there was not much effort made to save him. Be careful in the water. It is the Atlantic Ocean and there are jellyfish, also. The rainforest is gorgeous. Depending on how you walk to the falls, the path is very narrow (16-18\"). It is paved but if you walk down the river trail, it is steep and slippery with moisture and moss. Our guide told us he has fallen in every type of shoe he has worn. Leaving the falls and going the same direction, the path was dry and uphill. We had more time to look around and not worry about our footing.

The hotel did suggest going to La Parilla, but we thought it was going to be tourist-laden, so we opted for #60 per our employee at Enterprise Rental. Rio Mar is a good drive from San Juan, but we booked our rental car via Enterprise in Fajardo online. We were picked up from our hotel since they offer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pick you up service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and this was great since it ended up being only $60 for five days! Rio Mar offers Avis on site, but they of course were not able to beat our price quoted by Enterprise. After we dropped off our rental on the last day, they drove us back to the hotel, so we could catch our shuttle to the airport. This is what I call service! We drove to Old San Juan on our first day and the driving community in PR is a bit crazy, but not what I expected. Imagine bad drivers in the US not signaling. I drive in NYC, so this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad. We found FREE parking off Paseo de la Princesa next to a their main parking lot all the way in the back next to some office buildings. FREE is great! We took a walk around and got some great shots! One of our other days was devoted to driving to Ponce and this was a super scenic route! Once we got to Ponce, it was kind of a disappointed so most of the city reminds me of a bad Grand Theft Auto game. Okay, but I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be going back again. We had some ice cream at King Cream and guanabana was great. Back to the hotel. There were tiny little spider looking bugs, which crawled throughout our room and bathroom. Gross, but this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us too much. The food is ridiculous and if you want a cappuccino from the ERL Caf\u00c3\u00a9, they are slow as hell! We saw numerous people leaving the line since they could not get it going. I will have to say the coffee here was much better than Marbella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Palio was our last dinner and I ordered the scallop risotto in pesto. I wished they would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cooked the scallops less since they ended up being a bit chewy. The clams and mussels in their tomato sauce was great! Overall food was crazy expensive here at the hotel and I wish there were other restaurants in the area. As for other restaurants, Richie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was not great. The view was great, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about it. We had a server who was not very smart and they must have had the worst coffee in the history of coffee. I ordered a monstrous churrasca, which was way too much food and kind of bland. We got bit up by mosquitoes and left with a dozen bites on my back and legs. I would suggest only coming here for a drink and taking pictures. Our server also propped his leg up on one of our chairs to watch football while we were dining and picked his nose, then checked to see if he had and debris on his finger afterwards. GROSS. The beach was kind of littered with debris from a previous storm, but they offer FREE umbrellas when you make your trek to your beach chairs. Highly suggested if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a sunburn since you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pretty close to the equator. We took a trek out 20 minutes west off Rio Mar and found a really nice secluded beach with showers which branched off of these condo buildings, but we forgot water, so we drank from the shower! Hey, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Mexico and I have a stomach of steel. Pool and hot tub are open 24 hours, so it was nice to maximize on the cabanas at night and watch the stars. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go by the shore at night because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be bit up! We brought OFF with us so douse it! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad hotel overall, but not the best.

I followed the advice of a previous review and became a Wyndham Rewards Member, this was very helpful. They upgraded my room to ocean view, we were able to see the ocean from our balcony and listened to it every night. It was very nice. They also sent up cheese, crackers, bottled water, and juice twice. Once when we first arrived and again the day before we left. The parking was $15.00 a day for the self park, and fairly easy to use. When we first arrived the elevator from the parking garage was broke so we had to drag our bags through the convention center, very frustrating, but by the 3rd day we were there it was working again. The resort fee was only $11.00 and some change a day, that was a nice surprise, since we had been told it was going to be $30.00 a day. The restaurants at the resort are fairly pricey, and room service was pretty expensive as well. Lots of hidden fees. We did partake in two pina colada's and some bbq chicken wings at the bar by the pool and ocean, which was a $24.00, but the drinks were delicious and the bbq wings were amazing! We had a little fridge in our room, and we were able to make it cooler by adjusting the gage in the very back of it, but it still wasn't that cold, cold enough though. The staff was very gracious and helpful, and any request were quickly handled. The room was decent. I kept my flip flops on the whole time in the room because the floor was very dirty, but I think that just comes with the territory, with as humid as it is, stuff just sticks to the tile. Everything else was clean. The beach was pretty dirty, lots of cigarette butts, and ocean debris, but they provided lounge chairs for beach use which was nice. The towel service for the beach and pool area was great too! If you plan on traveling outside the resort you don't have to know spanish, but it is extremely helpful. We went to Isabella to snorkel, the Playa de Shacks, and were a bit disappointed, the current was really strong, so it made it hard to look at anything. But the water was very clear. We snorkeled on Culebra, which was better. Take the 20 minute hike they tell you about, it is worth it, but make sure that you go to the bay, not the open ocean area. It is rough and strong currents there as well, but the bay is amazing. Very calm and clear! We saw octopus, conche, blow fish, and other cool fish. There are lots of sea turtles there, but we didn't have the pleasure of seeing them. There is a guy named wiley on the island who offers transportation to Playa de Flamanco, he is really cool, and also offers boat tours out to some really cool snorkel places, we didn't have time for this, but it sounds like something worth looking into. One of the best beaches we found was in Liquillo, about 5 minutes from the resort. Also, the rain forest was beautiful and right by the resort.

Very nice common areas in hotel with pretty views out the huge beach-side windows. The in-hotel restaurants, Shimas and one Italian place (cannot remember name, but starts with a P, Palia?), were surprisingly very good. Great location for El Yunque exploration! All staff we encountered were wonderfully friendly and helpful, eager to assist and please. Negatives: The food at the tiki bar is terrible! This opinion was unanimous among all the guests we befriended, actually a humourous \"bonding topic\". The tiki bar drinks are very week and over priced. The terrible tiki phenomenon is particularly bothersome to folks who would like to take full advantage of the outdoors, day and night. We fealt like we were forced in doors for good food and drink. The rooms are pretty small, but are nice enough, many having ocean views. For those expecting a postcard tropical beach, you'll be disapointed that the sand is brown and the water is not the \"carribean ocean turqouis\" that you fantasize about, it's variable but often green-brown, much like the east coast of the US above Florida (I grew up in Virginia Beach).

Speaking of kiosks, this review would not be complete without mentioning the two that we visited. La Parilla, #2 and El Jefe's, #12. La Parilla is a bit more on the finer dining side, but well worth it with it's authentic food. I can not say enough wonderful things about #12. Fresh ground Burgers, Fresh baked buns, hand cut fries with El Jefe cheese sauce, beautfully decorated, reasonably priced, and the nicest owners you will ever meet besides Richie, the owner of Richie's. He deserves a review of his own! Our last night we saved for a dinner at Richies at the top of the hill. They provide a free shuttle from Rio Mar, which was very nice. The view was beautiful. The food was delicious. I recommend the flank steak. Since I am from Chicago and the Sox were in the playoffs, we decided to move and sit at the bar and have dinner, that's where we met Richie.

When we got there and decided not to upgrade to an ocean view room, the very rude man who attended to us told us we were reserved for a garden view room. We said that was OK. He kept pushing the upgrade and we declined. We got the room keys and went down to the first floor. He placed us in the end room and the only view we had was that overlooking parked trucks alongside a road. Noise..noise...noise. We said OK we might stay there but then noticed stains in the bedding and an odor in the room. We called and told them the accommodations were not acceptable and asked to be moved and were told that someone would call us back shortly. After waiting for almost an hour without a call back, we called again and did speak to a lady who utlimately moved us to the sixth floor. The room was OK, just barely. There was only one problem. My partner starting itching on the first night. She overlooked it and we went and purchased alcohol and rubbed it on the back of her legs and her entire back. The second night, we really did not sleep but sat up most of the night. I called down to complain that there was something wrong in the room because we were both itching. No response and no one came. We slept the last night and when she got up next morning, I was itching but her entire back including buttocks, legs and arms were covered in welts. We went to the Front Desk and the lady said it must have been mosquitos and I had to affirm for her that mosquitos are not able to turn people over and only bite on the backs as they sleep. I again raised the issue when we were checking out and nothing happened. The clerks words to me, \"Well, we will have to send engineering to fumigate the room.\" While I was there, several other guests were complaining of being bitten up in the rooms. When we got home, we were informed that the bites seems to come from bedbugs, chiggers or some other form of insect. She had to, and is still taking medication to get relief from this scourge. There was never an apology given nor was an attempt made to resolve this issue. A related issue. I paid $250 for the privelege of allowing this property to attempt to sell me a timeshare. I would think that if you are attempting to schmooze someone, you would show them and give them the best you have. This was not the case. So for my $250, we caught hell. THIS IS THE WORST TIME I HAD EVER SPENT IN A HOTEL IN MY 50 years of traveling. We could hear dogs barking most of the night in some of the rooms and the floors were never really kept clean.

One guy was asking why they were not spraying and the worker commented, \"we are accustomed to them.\" No one gave a hoot about customers. I would NOT recommend this property to anyone. Their customer service stinks. I also tried to make a reservation to play tennis with the pro while I was there. I made contact with the Concierge well in advance (2 weeks) and through several e-mails, he indicated that the pro would be in touch with me. After being there two days and not hearing anything, I went to the pro shop and told the young lady how unprofessional it was for a pro not to return a simple call. I was about to give this man $90 per hour to hit with me and I wanted to hit for about 4 hours. I never heard from him until I went there about 8:30AM and complained. I had called before I went down and when I got there, the young lady said he had gone to lunch. I guess lunch was more important than attending to a customer's needs. He did call around 4:00 PM to see if I wanted to hit. At about this time, I had had it with this property and everyone there. The internet did not work in the room where I was and I was promised someone would come and take care of it for me. That never happened.

We accepted this offer and glad we did. Prior to going to Rio Mar, I read all the reviews on trip advisor. Some were very positive and some were very negative. So I hoped for the best and prepared for the worst. My conclusion to it all..... all the post are correct, but it depends on what your expectations are as to if you take a positive or negative experience away from the trip. My husband and I like to travel, but we travel on a budget. We typically stay somewhere low costs so we have money to spend on excursions. Here is what I saw from the hotel.... no pro or cons, just facts: 1. Staff: very friendly, helpful, and spoke terrific English 2. Room: a step above a standard hotel, but not anything fancy. Big bed, great AC, tub drained slow (but not clogged as last reviewstated),, fridge did not work, but some reviews stated it cost $25 to use it... we didn't ask. Everthing clean except for one stain on towel. I just threw that towel to the corner and didn't use. 3. Maid service: did a great job cleaning our room each day 3. Pool: great \"adult\"pool and \"activity\" pool. This was a HUGE plus! 4. Beach: It is my understanding that Puerto Rico does not ahve white sand beaches. The sand at the hotel is brown, but very soft. Debris from the ocean on sand, but Ike was passing to the north, so could have casued that. Wave were rough, but again Ike passing to the north. 5. Lounge Chairs: lounge chairs avialable at pool and beach. Some are shaded by palm trees, others are in the open sun. Cabanas also available for rent. 6. Food/drinks: we only got drinks at the Tiki Bar the first night. $10 for a tropical drink. We headed to Walmart the next day and got our drinks, snacks, and a cooler. That saved alot of money. We were told there was a no cooler policy at pool, but we did not have a problem with the cooler at the beach. We ate a pizza from the bakery... $10 for personal pizza and it was not very good. I also ate a bagel, very good, from the bakery. It was about $5. There are plenty of places in the area to eat. There are fast food chains, along with local restaurants. We enjoyed La Parella (aka Kiosk #2) along Loquillo Beach. There are many restaurants at the resort also, but with resort prices. 7. Attire: The casino requires a collared shirt for men. Some of the resort restaurants require slacks for men. 8. Casino: Fun, took a while to get a waitress to bring drinks (free if playing) 9. Transportation/parking: $30 per person for one way from hotel/resort. If you plan to do things off the resort-- rent a car, much cheaper. It is easy to drive on the island. Our spanish is VERY poor but we managed to read the signs. Self parking was $15 per day. Valet was $20 per day. Self parking was easy. 10. Excursions: The resort offers many excursions, but at twice the price as local companies. 11. Extra fees at check out: There is are several taxes/fees that you pay at check out. Also be careful about phone calls. I made phone calls to various venders in nearby areas and it ended up being long distanse! $2.00/minute!!!!! Including the phone calls, I had an additional $50.00 to pay at check out. 12. Timeshare presentaion: Excellent experience. Very nice sales rep. Gave great information. Though we said no, he gave no pressure. 13. NIght life-- aside from casino, not a lot. This is a very laid back, quiet resort. Overall.... we had a good experience. This is not a 5 star resort. Know that going into it. I would stay here again, but I do not need lavish things. If you need to be pampered and spoiled, this is not for you. But if you do not need to be spoiled, and want somewhere to go where you can relax under a palm tree during the day and go to bed early at night..... try the Rio Mar.", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cLOVED the Rio Mar\u201d", "Author": "asNYC", "ReviewID": "UR19801743", "Content": "Stayed here on the recommendation of some friends.

I don't think we are very picky...but comfort, safety and cleanliness is a MUST for us. I did my research prior to arriving at the hotel. There fore, I kinda was embracing my self for the worst and hoping for the best. The location of the hotel is great, it's bit hidden and secluded which is great if you want to just get away. We spend two nights in Old San Juan and wanted to spend the last two nights more relax. We checked in and everything went very well..My husband was confused at the direction that was given to him regarding the location of the self park. (huh!!). It's just not that easy and simple given that was our fist time at this hotel. I asked for an upgrade, since the hotel was not packed to capacity and we learned that 600 conventioneers checked out on the day we checked in. Yes we were given an upgrade to Ocean View. the view was gorgeous! Nothing else was great except for the view. Well.....the room was like a ice box, everything damp and freezing cold. We turned off the air conditioner, went out for dinner. Returned to the room and showered, shower drained clogged, bath towel filthy with hair. Oh my gosh!! How much worst can it possible get? Well..the room was now a bit warm. We attempted to turn the air on..it started to smoke and would not turned on. After calling the manager attention to it, he send two \"engineers\" to the room. The first one stated the shower drain was not clogged the water just moved slow!! huh!! The second engineer stated the motto in the air conditioned is going bad. He was very nice, he called and asked that we transfer to another room..this was now 1am @ night!! They send a bell hop, he was so great.(1:30am).He made a request for another upgrade for the inconvenience. He took us to another room that was supposed to be an upgrade !! Well, it was bigger room, but shower were still clogged..Air did work, rooms were not cleaned. The Bell Hop went and asked the manager on duty \"Jose\" to do something else for us for the inconvenience!! We honestly did not want any thing other than to hurry and get away from this place of flit! Jose offered us breakfast or lunch. We would not return if it was given to us for Free! The staff and people of the hotel was great and Friendly!! \"Jose was great in trying to make us feel better. That we were so grateful for and said a special thank you to him as a person.

I'm a wyndham member so my room preference was all ready for me. The staff everywhere we went on the resort where very friendly, helpful and were actually quick with service which is unusual on an island (think island time). My room was on the west wing on the 5th floor and it was an ocean view. The fridge does not get cold so please keep this in mind before you spend money purchasing items that may spoil easily. I was not told this before check in so i only lost some milk for my morning coffee. Bottled water we kept on ice. We had a few ants by the coffee maker so we kept nothing on that table top. The bathroom had no vent so it got steamy quick during showers. I also thought the rainshower showerheads were overkill in a standard tub since most of the water hits the wall. That only works in shower stalls that have the space for it. The beach was very clean, with lounge chairs and umbrellas already set up for guests when you arrive in the morning. The two pools are side by side (adult and activity) which didn't keep the adult one too quiet since the water slide was right in the middle walkway of the two. The snacks poolside were very fresh and a good portion. They only do charge cards or you can charge it to your room which is great if we had known in advance not to carry cash/wallets to the pool/beach. We ate at the Marbella for a late snack one night and again to try the breakfast buffet. Spend the money on the buffet if you want a hot breakfast because it comes up to more if you order items seperatetly on the continental. We had $4 dollar bagels at the little snack stand right outside the casino mostly. We also ate at the italian rest.(Il Palio?) and it was a very good meal, good sizes (the veal parmegana covered the entire plate), very nice ambiance (low lighting, white table svc., piano player just outside the rest. entrance) and the price was very good for 3 adults with dessert. The tiramisu was on the small side but very fresh and one of the best i've ever had. One day, we even stopped by to see the iguana feeding alongside the front of the hotel. Casino is very tiny and dark i thought and i have no idea where they spent the millions to redocorate cause if that is new, i can only imagine what it was like before.

Two pools, both gorgeous, and the beach was serene and peaceful. As soon as we got there, we noticed how friendly and hospitable the staff was. Always ready to help. We could see iguanas, turtles and koi in the pond from our balcony. The room was decent, no big problems but nothing spectacular. The concierge gave us good tips on getting around -- for example, he told us when it's more efficient to rent a car and explore on our own and when it's better to take the hotel-guided tours. (We did both.) The one drawback I noted was the food. My husband's meal at Marbella's was chewy, stringy shrimp that clearly was not fresh. The waitress graciously took that meal off our bill without us asking her to. We thought Palio's (Italian) would be better, but not so. My meal was largely tasteless and the lobster, again, was chewy and not fresh-tasting. Our server was pretty terrible, too. Inattentive, slow, pretty much incompetent. The best experiences we had with food were outside the resort. One was a takeout stand near El Yunque that we absolutely loved. All different kinds of tacos, corn meal sticks, fried greasy goodness. And back at the hotel, breakfast at Marbella's was much better than their dinner. I also wish the hotel would prepare its guests more adequately for the tours it offers. We took a kayaking tour to Bioluminescent Bay and really had no idea what to expect. It turned out great, but a few people brought young children, which was a mistake. A couple of the kids cried and fussed, which wasn't the most pleasant sound to hear when you're trying to enjoy the glowing waterway and appreciate the sounds and sights of nature. I think it would be better to discourage families from bringing children younger than 12. The hotel's on-site car rental was very convenient, so we rented a car for the day to take to Old San Juan. We had some trouble finding our rental car after making the arrangements. \"Oh, it's just down the ramp and to the right\" really meant you have to go on a scavenger hunt inside the (dark) parking garage to find a car you've never seen before. We relied on keyless entry for that. Then, trying to return the car at the end of the day was a hassle. The parking garage entrance was semi-blocked with a \"FULL\" sign. We had to circumvent the hotel twice to figure out where to park the car. We also think we should have been told that half the restaurants were closed. No indication anywhere before or during the trip that our choices were so diminished. After trying and failing to reserve a table at the Grille Room, we were directed to Iguana's Pub at the country club and were very impressed with the food, service and atmosphere. I believe this was a case of false advertisement and in that sense, we did not get what we paid for. But, overall, I'd say it was a pretty good vacation.

That was my first mistake. We had room problems from day 1. My husband and I had left home at 5:30 in the morning to catch our flight. We were put into a room at the hotel with an air conditioner that was not working properly. Instead of just changing our room, they kept sending up the engineer. After 2 times, the engineer said he needed to change our thermostat. My husband had to go down stairs and request a room change at 10:00 at night b/c we wanted to sleep after a long day. They did not want to give us the room change either b/c they said they were fixing the problem by changing the thermostat. It was obviously going to take a little while. Finally, after requesting the manager, we got a room change. The rooms in Rio Mar are very standard. For a hotel that claims to be so luxurious, their rooms are far from it. They aren't all that clean. We found hairs and dust on our floors when we first walked in. There were stains on the carpets and sheets. The rooms are very plain. Nothing special about them at all. When I received my hotel bill to checkout, I had been charged for 2 nights of valet parking when my husband and I self-parked the whole week. When I asked them to change the bill, one of the girls at the front desk started speaking spanish to the other girl behind the front desk doubting my honesty about self-parking. Unfortunately for them, I understand Spanish very well and was very pissed off about the situation. Kelly, at the front desk, continued to argue with me saying it was not a big deal that she spoke spanish about me. I was very upset with her level of service and will be writing a letter to Wyndham corporate especially about her lack of customer service. Overall, I would say go somewhere else.

Going in I wasn't sure what to expect. I had read both good and bad reviews on the hotel. So, we got there and the rental car experience (airport) was a little messy but we made it down Rt 3 to the Rio Mar. The hotel and grounds are nice. Two golf courses. The lobby area is pleasant. There is a bar in this general area, that gets croweded with adults at night (esp weekends). There is also a small casino at the hotel. The Concierge was helpful in finding local restaurants. Wireless internet is available in the lobby area. There are 4 computers for use by all in the lobby area too. We were upgraded to a Jr Suite, which my wife enjoyed. I did take the advice from a review on this site to join the Wyndham rewards program before we went. The upgraded room was nice. Terry robes in the closet, flat panel TV, King size bed, large sitting area. We even received a bottle of wine with cheese and crackers. The Bed was turned down every night of our 5 day stay. The bathroom was clean and up to date (my pet peeve). The pools were nice. An adult only pool and others, plus a slide. The beach is very close. We enjoyed a nice long walk. The sand is not clean but its not dirty with trash. Just some minor things that wash in from the ocean- small pieces of wood, etc. It is a public beach, that is occupied by resort guests mostly. There are chairs and umbrellas available to use. There is security to get into and out of the resort. The weekend use, on the beach, was higher than weekdays. We ate breakfast at Marbella's one time (at hotel). Price was 20.00 pp. It was good with a large selection. We also ate at Richie's, LaParella's, and the restaurant on the corner of Rt 3, just down from the resort. The prices at local places are anywhere from $10-$15 pp. The food good and the portions large. The dining areas are all outside, so dont expect AC while dining at local places. I recommend Richie's for the view from the mountain. There is also all the regular fast food places in Loquillo and Fajardo, just east on Rt 3. We visited the large mall in San Juan and the outlet stores at Rt 3 & 66. Visit the rain forest. It was a good day. You will need time to enjoy everything and hike to the larger waterfall, if you want. You can drive the entire thing and get out to walk certain areas- falls, sight towers. Old San Juan was good. Lots of history. Have to go back and finish that tour. One drawback- not easy to access water sport activities. Were given a sheet and prices at concierge but never received a return call. Oh, and if you plan to do a lot, outside the resort, sharpen up on the Spanish. All traffic signs are in Spanish. I do recommend having a car if staying here.

We had a double queen room on the bottom floor and we didn't face the ocean, but we didn't really care. Our room had a refrigerator that looked old, but worked fine. In theory, there was an extra charge for using the fridge, but they didn't assess it on us. The bathroom was very nice and spacious with a lot of counter space. The front desk was very nice and helpful during check-in and check-out and we only ate in one of the on-site restaurants (Marabella), but our waitress was very nice and helpful. The two separate swimming pools are great; one for families and one for adults only. Our adults only pool was a great place to relax. The beach is great looking and the water is just the right temperature without being too hot or too cold. There are tons of sand dollars living on the bottom of the ocean right there, so that was pretty cool to see. The resort has two workers assigned to get you an umbrella and chairs for sitting on the beach, which is really nice. The tiki bar outside is just as expensive inside with a pina colada running about $11 each. The beach does need cleaned a bit more often to remove the cigarette butts, but if everyone was diligent about removing their own trash there wouldn't be a problem. Two complaints about the resort are parking and computer access. The self-park garage requires you to take a ticket when you park. Take the ticket with you because you have to stop at the valet's desk out front of the hotel to have them validate it before you can leave and take your car out of the parking lot. We ended up paying only $20 in parking despite being there for 4 days, so I don't know how that worked. Hauling the ticket around is a pain and they should really have someone working the exit booth of the garage. The only other complaint was computer access. The resort has four computers set up so that you can access the internet during your stay if you don't have your own laptop. I loved the idea, but you had to pretty much glare at the teens, pre-teens, and kids that were camped out on the computers without parental supervision. Eventually, one would disengage from Facebook and let you use the computer for 3 minutes. Where were the parents of these kids?? We did the rainforest and liked it except for how busy it was. Lots of people everywhere. Note to travelers: wear a bathing suit to the rainforest. We apparently didn't get that memo and didn't realize you could hop in whatever water you want. It also rained twice while we were hiking and a bathing suit would have been better than a shirt and shorts. We also did old San Juan, which was cool to see, but the parking was a nightmare.

I am sure most travelers would agree that the vast majority of hotel operations are neither hospitable or accomadating. The folks at the Rio Mar appear hell bent on bucking the standards of their own industry and actually treating the customers as....well, \"guests\". My wife and I arrived after mid-night Saturday morning two weeks ago. This was after the airline had postponed our flight repeatedly for more than 14 hours before taking off. Once airborne an on-board medical emergency forced our plane to divert to Albuquerque, NM for 2 hrs. We arrived in San Juan only to learn that after 32 hrs in the same clothing, our suitcases were sitting in Las Vegas and would not be in Puerto Rico to the following night. We drove in a down-pour to the Gran Melia where we had pre-paid for our \"accomadations\". There they informed us that our suite would not be ready for another 24 hrs and that they had no other rooms available. So a day and a half into what should have been 8 hrs of travel, we found ourselves pulling onto the property of the Rio Mar. Dead tired, dirty, agravated, and feeling pretty low, just as we turned into the Rio Mar a rather large crab with its comical sideways walk meandered across the path of our car. Mr. Crab took his sweet time crossing all the while it appeared that he was smiling and enjoying our meeting each other. We had our first chuckle in two days. Inside we began the check-in process. The desk clerk was already aware that we were dis-placed from the Gran Melia. She offered us the lowest rate available of $189 + tax, about $230 for the night. She then did something that most in business fail to do and this is to listen. Hearing us talk about overnight in the airport, the diverted flight, our lost luggage, the Gran Melia hotel fiasco, ect. she began pounding away at her keyboard. The clerk said that the Rio Mar wanted to help put an end to the suffering we were enduring on the trip and that they were giving us a complimentary up-grade to a suite. A bit more typing and she said that she was able to give us a complimentary late check-out to 3:00 PM (I'm sure there is a fee normally associated with this, the Gran Melia charges $150 for a late check out). She and the other desk clerk got a large bag and filled it with just about every imaginable toiletry article that we might need. So here's the whole ball of wax. The suite was very nice, with those large plush bathrobes that one expects to find in a top hotel. The property itself was lavish and along the lines of any 5-star resort. Room service was called around 3 AM and they also were prompt and courteous. The Rio Mar has all of the amenties one would expect to find. If this is your first trip to Puerto Rico then get ready to have a blast.

Let me explain. I am one who goes to timeshare presentations, because they offer you a nice trip for a low price. Now for 5 days I paid $495. When I went to our timeshare presentation, the person said we had a great deal coming here because the usual rate for the room we were in was $418 a nite!!!! WOW. I would have been mad if I paid that amount for the room, but since mine come out to about $100 per nite, I was very happy. PROS: The hotel is big. Huge. Emormous. We had a rental car and it takes about 3-4 to drive out to the main road from the parking lot. If you golf this is a dream resort. We went for a get -away just to relax, and we did. We got an Ocean Suite after check-in(I didnt have to bribe or prompt anyone either). The room was very nice and clean. Flatscreen, internet ready and a beautiful! view of the pool and ocean. The breeze was great. Nice little balcony to hang out on. The pool is big and clean and a joy to swim in. It has many restaurants, we only ate at one. The Marbella was nice, we only ate breakfast there. The buffet was $20 pp, but it came w/ everything. Omelet station, pastrys, fruit--you name it. So I guess the price wasnt too bad. Overall, the Rio Mar wasnt too bad. I have stayed in better hotels, but this was a nice one to hang out in if you are with the family. On Saturday nite, the lobby is decked out in candles, there was a guy playing guitar and later on a little Spanish band played while the people danced. That was cool to see. CONS: Ok the bad. Even though the hotel decor was nice, you could see where the exterior needs touching up. This building seems like it has been here for a while. While paint isnt falling off, it could use renovation. Also, the beach is DIRTY! Although the beach is off the property and public, you would think since guests were there you would clean it up. Full of cig butts, straws, cups, and other small things. I had to watch my step. But the sand is soft and water clear. There are a few vendors on the beach where you can rent a kayak or other sports, but not too many water sports at the resort. You have to go off site and pay like $80-100 for those. As with hotels everything is double in price, whether its bagels, muffins or water. The drinks are small and cost $10(they are good though). Two big things I hated was parking. $20 per day for valet, $15 for self park. Fortunately for me the lot was full for self park, so their other lot the gate didnt work, so most of the trip I didnt pay for parking. I think I paid only one day. Also, you know when you check in they place a hold on your credit card for incenditals. Usually 2-300 bucks right? These jokers placed $900 hold on mine!!! They said there system was set up that way, they cant help it. I was [-] because 1. No one told me that at check-in, 2. Who places almost a $1000 block on people's credit card? Between that and the car rental, I had $14 credit left. Fortunately, I had some more cash I could have used. So all in all a nice vacation. It is an expensive resort, so bring some cash if you want to eat/drink there. I would suggest renting a car, becuase its far from the airport, and if you want to go off the property, you'll need it, unless you are a professional hiker. They charge for transportation everywhere, so even though parking is $15 bucks, I would pay for convenience. All the major car rentals are off-site from the airport, so just reserve on-line and take a shuttle there. The El Yunque rainforest is very close, so drive there and its free.

We paid a taxi $20 and went 3 miles outside of the resort to a store and got 18 beers for $26 and a few snacks and things to make sandwiches.(Please don't think that you can walk to the surrounding stores and restaurants because they are not as close as some others made them sound.) You can request to have a refrigerator put in your room for $24 for your entire stay. The room was very nice and it looked just like the other travelers photos. The bed was very comfortable. We booked our trip through Priceline and did not know what type of room we would be getting. When we arrived, they gave us a room on the second floor and we asked for a room on a higher floor because that was what was suggested by some other reviewers and I am glad we did. They gave us a mountain view room on the sixth floor. I am sure that the ocean view is the best, but this was a beautiful view. We woke up in the morning to the clouds unveiling the mountains and we could see the rainforest. Our balcony was above a large pond with big koi fish, turtles, and iguanas. The resort was very well kept and the gardens were lush. The pools were also pretty, but I spent most of my time on the beach. We felt the ocean was alot bluer than someone else had said. One thing to pay close attention to is your list of charges at checkout. We had $79 room charges per day on our bill that we had to dispute but they were very accomodating and removed those extra charges. With all this being said, read the reviews but realize that everyone's opinions and standards are different.

I even questioned the cleanliness of the sheets- hairs and stains. Maybe they just needed to be thrown out. No mini fridges. Overall the room was very disappointing. The pool is fun, we liked the water slide, and liked the fact the lifeguards at pool were really watching the kids. Beach/Pool cabanas are $150 for a day, and come with a cooler of drinks and a snack tray. they do all kinds of things so check the concierge or towel hut for times and places. Feeding the Iguanas is a must do!! The beach is nice, the waves are big and great for boogie boards, we rented them for $15 a day. We ate at Marbella, very reasonable and kids food came out real quick. It was a big group of us, and everyone liked the different things we ordered. Check out the ERL place by the casino. they have coffee, sodas, sandwiches, muffins, etc. Very reasonable and little tables close by to eat at. Texas Hold Em table was closed when we were there, and that is what we wanted to play at casino. Didn't do any other games.

First off the room had a great view of the mountains. rainforest and lanscape. You really feel like you're on a vacation, plus each room has a private balcony. My freind and i arrived in San Juan July 21 and we were a bit nervous that we wouldnt find our way around easily. We arranged in advance, for the hotel to pick us up from the airport. They were really easy to find. The cost for the transportation was a bit much at $30pp/per way, but it was definetly convient. Once you arrange to have them pick you up they automatically give you a bill for a roundtrip ride, so the total cost for two people was $120.00. If you cancel the ride going back to the airport you dont get reimburst or that was my understanding from reading the ticket they give you when they pick you up. Upon arriving at the hotel the driver pointed out a few places off the resort we may like to visit such as places to eat and shop. Check in was fast and easy, the staff extremely friendy and even allowed us to check in a couple hours early. The property was lovely, cost for food in the resort ran us btw $40-$50 a meal ( we only ate breakfast on the resort). Food off the property I didnt find that much cheaper, maybe we didnt travel far enough but the price was about the same as the resort. The food was awsome though, wroth the money. We rented a car the second day we were there for about $65a/day. I suggest if you stay here to rent a car because the cost of the cab would be more depending on how many times per day you would need a cab. We were going to take a cab to the rainforest which cost $150 (just to give you an idea of how much you would be spending) so we rented the car. And self parking is like $15-$20 a day, and you must validate your parking ticket at the valet both everyday if you park in the garage. Driving around SanJuan is easy once you get on the highway, the local roads are very narrow and windy. The hotel provides information and directions to different places to visit if you ask. Theres a outlet mall about 2miles that has just about every store you can find in the states, and if you dont feel like eating local there's always KFC Mcdanolds,Berger King, and even a Sizzler. The beach at the resort was lovely. The water was warm and the waves not too big. The pool was warm and big and a seperate kiddy pool. As far as stuff to do at night, theres not much. The casino is open untill 2am and you can hang out by the pool or the bar located in the lobby of the hotel. Everything in San Juan is closed by like 10 so theres nothing to do off the resort.

The beds are very comfortable and the decor is neutral and crisp. We knew prices would be in resort range from the reviews here, but made it work with breakfasts in the cafe by the casino, usual size lunches and not pigging out at dinner. Honestly, we were not here to eat, with the exception of trying some Puerto Rican cuisine. Time on the beach in a swim suit was much more important. We did splurge on drinks. They are $10 but you are on vacation! We fed the iguanas twice, my husband golfed on the River Course, we toured the rain forest and took the Sail & Snorkel trip. The rain forest is a nice day - great scenery, a hike, and lunch at a local roadside restaurant. I am now addicted to mofungo. the sail/snorkel trip is a wonderful day on the water. The night life after dinner is limited to the casino and the pools. Walks on the beach are romantic - lots of moonlight and starlight.

We were looking for a resort to get away and do nothing. We wanted pool, beach, and great weather. It was a getaway from our kids for my wife and I. We read almost all the reviews over the last year and read many good and many not so good. We felt that people were missing the boat on this resort since it became a Wyndham about 1-1/2 yrs ago. We found out they remodeled every room. Our room was basic overlooking the rainforest, but very clean, flat screen, granite, and great bed! We rented the fridge for $25 so we could cut down on the food costs that we had read about. If you go to this resort expecting a budget resort, you are in the wrong place. This is a high end resort with very good restaurants and service. We did not rent a car. If you want to do activities, rent a car. If not, you can get away without it. We walked to the convenient store (no sidewalks, so for daring people only. Otherwise, take a cab) at the bottom of the hill and picked up groceries and had some great Chinese food (amazing Orange Chicken) at the casual restaurant. The Isamar bakery was great as everyone has said. They have lunch sandwiches that locals enjoy. We bought our own liquor at the store because, yes, the drinks are very high. Also, the bell station might have a cooler that you can use if you ask them nicely. Don't forget to tip for the great service that you will probably get. There is a convenient store & gift shop at the resort. Good place to pick up T-shirts and do some Sale shopping. They sell liquor there, but of course, you will pay more. Less than at the bar though. The Pool--Adult pool was great. Kids were having a great time in their own pool. We liked that. NO MUSIC at the adult pool. We knew that and brought our Ipod and docking station. There are some umbrellas but probably wouldn't get them in high season. Beach was great with umbrellas the staff will put up for a small tip. Constant breeze can be expected which cools things down nicely. There are a few Iguanas around, but they are pretty cool and they make sure there aren't too many around. Spa--we did a couples massage for 25 minutes at the Mandara Spa. The Spa services are high price, but it is a very nice place to be pampered. The workout facility is also in the spa and has very nice updated equipment with personal TV's, Nautilus circuit and free weights. The Food--everyone says the food is so expensive. Really, it is not. It is higher than a budget resort, but fairly priced to slighly high. These are some nice restaurants. It is like going out to a nice restaurant in the city somewhere. Palio is great high quality Italian. We split dishes since we didn't want leftovers & it kept costs down. The Rigatoni Bolognese was as good as anywhere, including Italy ($18). The chicken wings at Marbella are totally underrated. They are perfectly crisp and outstanding. Many people we saw found this out as well. Great when tossed with the Sweet Chile sauce from the Shrimp Satay! Get this if you go there. Grille Room was a typical steakhouse. Prices were appropriate. Steaks were perfectly done. Take the shuttle for dinner at the Grille Room. It is a nice change of scenery. To keep our money for dinners, we generally ate PB&J & Tuna Salad in the room for lunch. Woke up too late for breakfast most of the time :) Don't waste the money on any of the buffets unless you can eat a lot! Muffins, bagel & coffee is available at the coffee shop next to the casino. Yes, it is a $4 muffin, but who cares, you are on vacation and it is a big muffin. People we met went to Richie's a few times. They said the food was basically the same price and very good, but the drinks were much cheaper. Golf--great but not spectacular. Ocean course is really not on the ocean. 1 hole is. Go twilight and enjoy golf for $70 or $85 depending on season. Best deal by far. Local told me that El Conquistador has a great course. If you have a car and want to golf, try there. Nightlife--None (except Casino). I shared my concern about this with the GM and he says they are working on that currently. New \"margaritaville\" type restaurant will be opening that will stay open late. Tiki bar near the ocean would be great, but it was Turtle season so Island law sets curfew. I believe this will be changing in the future as they have realized it is the one major thing missing. Casino was very small as expected and not worth the time unless you like to gamble. Excursions--You can set up excursions that will keep you busy at the Concierge desk. Ride from the airport--unless you are travelling with a large group and can work out something special, the best deal is the shuttle from the resort. $30/person each way. I called cab & car companies and that was the best for 2. Kids--we would bring our kids to this resort. There were activities during the day and the pool was nice with one slide. I would want a car if I had kids so I could keep food costs down. Amigo grocery is a 10 minute car ride or $30 round trip cab ride. Also at the same place you will find KFC, Subway, & Burger King. Shopping--we found a place called the Carribean Trading Company that is right around the corner from the convenient store across the main highway. They put together all the local specialties for gift baskets for the resorts. Unique stuff and decent prices. Locally made jewelery, coffee, and hot sauces in addition to many other things. Not some cheap souvenier store so no T-shirts. Wrap-up...if you go here expecting a high end resort with resort pricing and plan accordingly, you will have an amazing time at this beautiful place. If you book on Expedia, get a great deal, and don't plan properly, you are in for a rude awakening which is what I see in a lot of the reviews. This is a great resort with a great staff that went out of their way for us. We will go back here with our without the kids.

We took our 3 kids to this hotel on a family get away. Here are some things you won't be told or know till you get to the property: 1. The \"shuttle service\" costs $60 per person round trip regardless of where you go (ie, to & from the airport, 10 minutes to the grocery store, etc). If you choose to rent a car be very careful as the locals do not use signals and make turns across lanes in front of other drivers 3. The restaurant prices are off the charts. Don't go by the menus on the web site, they are old and out of date. Expect to pay $100+ per meal and that's sharing dishes. All cocktails by the pool are $9, beer is $4, personal pizza is $20, etc. 4. The free breakfast included in the \"Escape Package\" doesn't include gratuity. You will get be charged unless you go down to the front desk and point it out. Also children do not eat free, that is a very broad statement on their website. Only kids age 4 and under are allowed to eat free. They say \"under the age of 5\" and in Puerto Rico that means, 5 doesn't count. 5. The beach surf is dangerous and deadly. It was either yellow or red flag the entire time (6 days). The rip tide in the area is bad and they even have signs posted on how to swim out of rip tides. There are no life guards on duty and it is swim at your own risk. We witnessed a man save a woman and her son in a rip tide while hotel personnel watched!! I was incredulous that they didn't help. Their excuse was simply \"we aren't supposed to.\" 5. The pool area is not family friendly. The adults do not choose to stay in the \"adult pool\" and will play in the area that is supposed to be designated for kids. If you worry about scantily clad individuals or PDA, beware. 6. You cannot bring food from your room to the pool area. So those PBJ sandwiches by the pool are a big no-no. We were dressed down by a worker (the Spanish lesson teacher) in front of our children for eating by the towel shack, she said \"if a manager saw you, you guys would be in big trouble, you can only eat food you've purchased from our restaurants.\" 7. Their accounting system has difficulty identifying different forms of payment. ie., if you use a company credit card to reserve the hotel but another for incidental charges, you'll probably see the charges show up on the wrong card. 8. The hotel doesn't designate non-smoking in the hallways, so no matter where you go, the hotel hallways have a bad odor. 9. The staff in the hotel are hit and miss - one minute you are talking with Andra, who by the way is awesome, and the next you are dealing with a rude operator on the phone who doesn't speak English.

Marbella breakfast, YUM YUM. all to say, blow the budget, it was well worth it for our vacation. We enjoyed and will re-visit. Kudos to Gasha and Josie for making our stay so pleasant.

But, this is where the conference was being held so the only choice was not to attend at all. Puerto Rico is hot and humid in June, however, the ocean breeze kept it tolerable during the day and downright pleasant for our two outdoor evening events. Our room: We had a double queen on the 6th floor facing the ocean. The view was magnificent--beach, palm trees and clouds floating in the bright blue sky. While the bathroom was kept quite clean and mildew free (a real challenge), I can't say the same for the closet and the dresser drawers; both were dank and mildew-smelling. Even with the a/c running very cold all day and all night, it was still quite humid in the room. There is no doubt that the rooms need to be refurbished and the hotel is well aware of this. Let me add that I think that they have to do a better job vacuuming the bare floors and the rug (especially between guests) and that I would appreciate fitted sheets that completely cover the mattress and don't pull out as I toss and turn. Drives me crazy that even the expensive hotels insist on skimpy flat sheets that don't stay in place. The staff: Here is a hotel that knows that it is in the people/service business. Everyone was so pleasant and friendly--welcoming. Yes, there were issues during out stay -- some were ours and some were what we heard from other people at our conference--but they were taken care of quickly and without a lot of fuss such that by the time we left, all was forgotten. The pool/beach: The best thing that we did was to rent a beach side cabana. There was no way that we could sit on the beach all day long, even with an umbrella. In June, the sun is very high in the sky making it very intense. The cabana was under the palms and with the breeze was ever so pleasant. We alternated between the shade and the sun all day long. The pool staff was attentive, coming by on a regular basis to make sure that everything was okay, etc. Kudos to Carmen and her entire staff For sure, I could have done without the loud blaring music while I sat around the pool and thankfully it was turned off our last day there and we could actually enjoy the peaceful sound of the ocean. I'm sorry that they are planning to re-do the pool area. I really liked the laid back atmosphere and can really live without a 'lazy river.' The food: We did not bother with the breakfast buffet (though it looked delicious). It was cheaper --and better portion control--to just order a breakfast entree (excellent Eggs Benedict--not swimming in Hollandaise). We ate dinner one night in Marbella and it was very nice--not rushed at all. I did not find the restaurant prices to be any higher here than at any other resort I have stayed at--and yes, resort prices tend to be higher than what you can get if you leave the property. On the other hand, consider that leaving the Rio Mar to eat means that you need transportation--taxi or a car rental--so figure that into the cost of meals. Renting a car: it is much cheaper to rent a car at the airport than at the hotel. Driving from the airport to the hotel is no worse than the city driving that most of us are accustomed to and having a car gives you the freedom to leave the property and explore the surrounding area --such as the rainforest which is just a few minutes drive from the hotel and which offers hiking and fantastic views. The bottom-line is that we really enjoyed our stay at the Rio Mar and should we return to Puerto Rico for a vacation, we would definitely consider staying there again.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cOver priced\u201d", "Author": "TripAdviceforFun", "ReviewID": "UR16969727", "Content": "Although the setting is beautiful the hotel is showing its age.

It was BEAUTIFUL. At first I was worried because some of the reviews were not very flattering, however, it was more than I ever expected. We had an ocean view room on the 2nd floor. It was a nice view. Each room has a table and chairs out on the balcony. The room was very nice and clean, granite counter tops in the bathroom and had a modern look. We have expensive taste and this hotel room was great. Noise was never a problem. The weather was around 85 degrees everyday. There were quite a few iquanas walking around which was scary at first, however, they quickly run away from you. You need to rent a car and don't do it from the hotel. I went on cheaptickets.com and rented a car. The hotel uses Avis but it is very expensive. It is $15.00 per day to park your car in the parking deck. Don't take the rain forest tour, drive it yourself. In addition, the shuttle from the airport was $30 per person each way, so you will save a lot of money renting the car. Do not eat at the resort. The restaurants are over priced. The breakfast buffet was $25 per person and $19 per person for continental. Dinner averaged between $30-$55 per person. However if you go off the resort there are plenty of restaurants and fast food chains (KFC, McDonald's, UNO\"s, Chili's, TGI Fridays etc). There is even a Walmart nearby. The staff was very nice and courteous. Although I did not bring a child, it was very kid friendly. It had a playground, kid pool and lots of kid activities. The spa was expensive, approx. $140 per person for a massage. This hotel is right on the beach, there is an adult pool andw a regular pool. The casino is tiny and closes at 2pm on weekdays and 4pm on weekends. We went on a Sun-Thurs and the resort was quiet and not over crowded. If you like golf, be prepared to pay $120 green fees per person. San Juan is about 20mins away. The ride from the airport was about 20 mins if you take the toll road. Take the toll road, it is $1.50 and the quickest route to the hote. This hotel was very upscale and nice.

Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try all the restaurants but here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my overview of those we did try. Marbella- Only ate breakfast there but very mediocre food in my opinion. The breakfast buffet was average in quality but with tax and tip comes to almost $30. A few times we ordered breakfast off the menu but it was rather uninspired and bland. Wait staff service was average to downright rude. Since it was busy with three convention groups they seemed harried and not at all friendly. One waiter complained to us that he was working so hard while the guests were having fun. One waitress was almost indignant that she had to bother with writing a bill for my breakfast (my husband had a voucher and I did not). She overcharged me and then billed me for his pot of coffee and refused to do anything about it when I questioned it. She claimed he overspent his voucher (he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) put his coffee on my bill. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to ask for a manager (but did put it on my comment card) since we had already waited about 40 minutes just to get the check but she lost out on a tip. Shimas- Good (not great) food. Service here was good. Large portions! I had half my lo mein put in a to-go box (love the fact that there was a small refrigerator in the room) and it was enough for both of us to have for lunch the next day. Lobby Bar, Tapas Bar, Tiki Beach Bar - all were good with good service. We preferred the Tapas Bar (downstairs near the Palio restaurant) because it was quiet and classy with a soft live piano music. The Tiki Bar is fun for an afternoon cocktail. Room service- this is where I thought the hotel excelled. We had pizzas and salads from room service several times. Waiters were extremely friendly and went out of their way to bring us extra items like rolls and wine glasses (for our own wine). We loved the veggie pizza and the Mediterranean salad. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The room was very spacious but the space could have been used better. The king size bed was pushed too far down towards the window, which meant the chair and ottoman, had to be squeezed into a tight space between the bed and the window. There was loads of wasted space on the other side of the bed. But that was a minor complaint. The bed was very comfortable, nice flat panel TV (with inputs so we could view our digital photos), good drawer space in the dresser (but my pet peeve, no drawer in the bedside tables). I liked the tile floors but it is time for the carpet around the bed to be replaced. Liked the little bar area in the foyer. Coffee maker (but pretty bad tasting coffee), storage area for the ice bucket and a small drawer for our snacks and a small (empty- yeah!!!) refrigerator. I hate having to push things aside in a mini bar fridge that is pre-stocked with expensive items. Bathroom was large enough for two people to move around. Wish the toilet was enclosed but that was a minor dislike. Good supply of bath products (even aloe gel and bubble bath) replenished daily. Soft towels. Really nice bathrobes upon request. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any complaints about noise. Maybe we were just lucky that people around us didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slam doors. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Room views - this is where you can make or break your vacation if you like a nice view and enjoy sitting on your balcony. VERY BIG difference in room views, some can be really awful. There are six or seven floors of rooms depending on the wing. The lobby is on level three so if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be near the noise of the lobby bar and the casino avoid 3rd floor rooms in the west wing. Ocean views- Ocean view rooms in the west wing overlook the gardens and IMHO are in the best location (my husband had one of these on a previous stay and loved it). Ocean view rooms in the east wing overlook the family pool and can be noisy. Ocean view rooms in the middle overlook the main Marbella garden but the palm trees can obscure the view. A few of these overlook the roof of the Marbella restaurant. Lower floor rooms in any of these wings won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a good view of the water. Garden view- might or might not be overlooking a garden. You might be facing the parking garage or the driveway to the valet garage. Rain forest view - This is what we had and it was lovely, mainly because we were on a higher (5th) floor in the east wing. Below us was the lagoon where the iguanas live. Forest view rooms in the west wing are awful, probably the worst rooms in the hotel. They overlook the rooftop of the casino and parking garage and very loud air conditioner units. Forest view rooms in the middle aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good either because they overlook the front entrance and portico or so they have both the traffic noise and the air conditioner unit noise. Jr. Suites - some are Ocean Suites, some are forest view. They can have the same concerns with views as the standard rooms. Our friend stayed in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view jr. suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and had mostly a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153palm tree view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd overlooking the Marbella garden. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Service Level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Very uneven. When we checked in the front desk clerk, while efficient, was not warm or welcoming. A bad impression of the hotel from the start. During the week other front desk staff were better so I learned to avoid the one male clerk who had originally checked us in. Wait staff in the restaurants were for the most part not good or friendly. However room service waiters were great. Maids were good and friendly. Only once was there a different person who cleaned our room who did a poor job (floor wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vacuumed, only partial replacement of the towels). I liked getting automatic evening maid service. Many hotels are only offering this service on-request these days. Each evening the maid would stop by and offer turn down or just towel replacement, always with a smile and good chocolates (not the yucky stuff that some hotels give out). Service requests - We had a problem with a faulty door lock. It kept disallowing our keycard. I got three new key cards and they would work once then stop working. It took three phone calls and several hours to get security to come up and fix the lock. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Valet and parking- not friendly but the service was efficient. We used the on-site Avis car rental and it was good. We valet parked on our first night then used the self-park thereafter. Valet was $20 plus tip, self-park was $15. They add 7% tax to these rates. The garage for self-parking was very easy access. The employee lot that others have recommended using for free was being monitored by a guy in a golf cart during our stay to be sure hotel guests weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t using it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Pools - Very nice pools each with a hot tub. Enough umbrellas and trees to provide shade if you want that. Loved the fact that they have a separate adult pool. Lounge chairs at the adult pool were great with thick cushions. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Cleanliness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Upkeep seemed good both in the hotel and around the grounds and pools. Gardens were beautiful and well maintained. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c High in the restaurants and bars as everyone says but pretty normal for a resort of this type. There are easy ways to cut costs such as keeping your own snacks, beer, wine, etc. in your room fridge. Room service pizza and salads were large enough to serve two, with our own wine and the lovely view from our balcony we preferred \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eating in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to dining in restaurants with minimal atmosphere. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Broadband Internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c $14.95 per day, free for Wyndham By Request members. Sometimes ran a little slow if the lines were busy but overall it was pretty fast. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Noise from lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Some evenings there was a live band playing at the lobby bar. And when large convention groups convene at this bar it can get loud. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nice soft sand with plenty of lounge chairs. Great for long walks if you turn left up the beach from the hotel grounds. We had some stormy weather a couple of nights so the red flag was up a few days. One night there was a really bad storm that washed tons of ugly debris on the beach. Clean up crews were there immediately working on it but it was a multi day process. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Casino \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Very small but nice if you want to drop a few dollars. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Shopping - Typical resort gift shop with upscale tropical clothing, overpriced sundries, etc. Nice little kiosk outside the gift shop sold local souvenirs. Golf shop at the clubhouse had a nice selection of clothing. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Location - 20 miles from the airport. Drive took about 45 minutes using the toll road route. Great location if you want to spend time at El Yunque (a must!). Very close to Luquillo Beach and its famous kiokos (food kiosks). The Amigo grocery store is about 5 minutes away. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 WBR perks - Enjoyed the free internet and small welcome snack. In conclusion we ended up liking this resort after our original poor impression. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play golf or use the spa so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on those amenities. We were there on a business trip and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I would choose this resort for a personal vacation. It really has potential to be better if they could work out some of the problems with staff friendliness and upgrade their food. There is really nothing they can do about the layout of the buildings so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the guest to avoid rooms in poor locations.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "champaign, IL", "Title": "\u201cGood but not great\u201d", "Author": "dianakg78", "ReviewID": "UR15590227", "Content": "We have traveled to Puerto Rico on April 6-10 2008.

Otherwise this hotel is clearly not worth to spend a lot of money. The worst part was the beach. It was flat out terrible. First 2 days they did not even clean it, so it was covered in seaweed and trash. Waves were huge! Impossible to swim or enjoy water. Also, sand was pretty bad. Nothing like beautiful white sand beaches we have seen in Jamaica. Food and drinks were pretty expensive and not that good at all. Basically you have one kitchen just different restaurants (more like rooms). Average price on drinks $10. We had a breakfast once and one dinner (dinner was $90 for 2, cheapest plates). Service was good, though. Housekeepers came in 3 times a day. Room was good and clean, but not tropical or fancy, just standard room. The best thing we did was renting a car. It saved us tons of money and we had so much fun driving around to closest towns and exploring on our own. Plus we saved money by eating off the resort. But honestly, food in Puerto Rico is very boring. I did not try anything I liked more than just to satisfy my hunger. I have many pictures of our Puerto Rico trip. Day one was area near Rio Mar.

I booked it through cheapcarribean.com and expected an amazing resort according to the reviews and pictures, and thats exactly what i got. However, there were a few things which i wish i would have known before going: 1. Everything costs money there, and a lot: Food there is really expensive, even the bakery which is advertised as inexpensive, charges about three dollars just for a plain bagel. Room service is pretty expensive too, however, their food is really good. Same with the restaurants and alcohol, expensive but good. Also NOTE: if your planning to rent a car or have a car there, they charge $10 a day to park, something we did not know, so i dont recommend having a car, u really don't need it unless you want to go to the local outlet mall. 2. There wasn't much to do onsite: When i went the hotel had just been switched over from a Westin hotel to a Wyndham hotel so the casino was shut down, however they did give free tickets to the casino in a nearby hotel. There is an arcade in the hotel for kids, I'm not sure if they charge you to play but probably do. The pool and beach are great and are probably where you'll spend most of your time. Though i didnt get a chance to go to the spa, the prices weren't too bad, around the same prices as hear in the states. Other than that there's really not much to do on site. Recommendations: 1. Take some tours: i did the horseback riding, bacardi tour and san juan tour. Their like $90 to $125 each but worth it. The bacardi tour especially is nice and has a gift shop which is very affordable. The san juan tour is really nice because you get a chance to visit san juan and explore. The horseback riding is great because it takes you through the jungle which is literally next door to the hotel. 2.

We opted for the self-serve parking ($15/day) instead of the valet and that worked out great....a bit of inconvience to go to the valet desk to validate our parking ticket everytime you leave the hotel garage. Room was nice. Large comfortable room with a real nice balcony with table and chairs....great for enjoying a cup of coffee in the morning.

Always lots of chairs and umbrellas available all day long. Pool (adult) also nice...quiet in contrast to the kids pool which got pretty crazy at times....lots of kids at the resort the week we were there. We only ate at the resort one day at Aqua Luna.....pretty good seafood, not a huge menu. But excellent service and good wine list. (~ $120 for 2). We also ate at the following local restaurants: Richies - good PR food -- 4 minutes drive from hotel-- good view (not sooo great at night though...go for lunch) ~ $100 for 2 Metropol - OK PR/Cuban food - 15-20 mins from hotel -- ~ $75 for 2. Don Pepes -- VERY good PR food -- 5 minutes from hotel -- ~ $80 for 2.....don't be afraid of the surroundings.......safe area! At at Raices in Old San Juan one night..........Local PR food (more upscale) better food at Don Pepes -- ~ $110 for 2. Took a drive up to the rainforest one morning....highly recommend the trail to Minas Fall...about 1.5 miles roundtrip....well paved trails.....nice hike!

Booked trip through Expedia. First time to Puerto Rico. Rio Mar is very expensive for the somewhat mediocre standard. The whole resort is of usual 4 star carribean standard, but service/management is of higher quality than in 'spanish' carribean places. We got a free upgrade from resort view to ocean view, in main building. Write them in advance. Room was alright - almost nice, but not great. Bathroom was roomy, however, the handyman must have had 10 thumbs and no ruler when doing the installations/tiling. Floor cold as ice, conditioner noisy and could not do heating. On positive side there were no mosquitos/bugs on this time of the year. :) Great bed! The problem with Rio Mar is that you have to pay for what-ever move you make. 25 USD for breakfast buffet, plus some times the waiters add 15% gratuity on the bill. 15 USD per day for wifi in the room. 20 USD per day for parking for rented car. You do want to rent a car to get around. Valet staff have the slowest 'walk' I have ever seen. Food and beverages are quite expensive, e.g. 5 USD for local beer and 10 usd for cocktails which arent all that. A good lunch or dinner for two will set you back 100 usd plus wine/alcohol. A dinner in the japanese restaurant scared us off from eating anything else than breakfast in the resort. I cant recall having tasted more bland sushi/rolls/salads anywhere else. Pool-area was nice, but sunbeds were only good in the adult section. Not enough sunscreens. 150 USD for renting a poolside cabina/tent-roof per day - crazy! The iguanas were funny - suddenly running down the palms - even moved around near the pool. Do go for iguana feeding at 11.00 - especially if you are childish or have kids. The beach was nice too, but somewhat windy. Surf probably too big for kids younger than teenagers. The beach could look a lot nicer with better sunbeds, sunscreens and decor, but as it is now, its not attractive to lie there. You need a car to get out of the resort. We had diner at Richie's app. 1 mile up hill to the right. Fantastic view, friendly service and very nice food. Generous portions. The best food we had was at La Parilla app. 10 minutes drive on eastern beach. Perfect seating for having dinner and watching the sun go down. Really nice food, with a good local touch, but huge portions. Friendly service and reasonable priced. Many regulars. Probably a busy area in week-ends. Dont get scared off by the local touch of the many kiosks there. Do drive up El Younqe rain forrest. Fantastic to drive uphill through the jungle, great views, water falls, fantastic nature.

The beach is very nice and well-kept--ie the sweep the seaweed away from where people sit. The pools are gorgeous and very, very well-kept. They are hosed off every morning and regularly cleaned and maintained from any debris that gets blown into them during the day. There are limited dining options here. In fact, 2 of the restaurants were not even open when we were there. We ate at \"The Palm\" -- the steakhouse at the golf club one night--it was expensive for the portion that you get, but still a nice meal. And we went 'off-'campus' to a local restaurant another night. The breakfast/lunch restaurant is nice, lower key but expensive. What they don't tell you at breakfast is that a cup of coffee with no refill is $4, but if you buy the pot of coffee, that's $7. The buffet looked beautiful, but it was just too pricey to tempt our palate. You really don't have much of a choice however unless you're willing to hop in the car and drive to Luquillo or somewhere else--but who really wants to do that if you just want to sit poolside and relax? Our fave find was the gelato in the Italian pizzeria. My husband was originally scheduled to play golf there at the resort, hence the reason for us staying there, but it was just too windy while we were there and spending $175 for a round of golf that was not going to have optimal playing conditions is hard to justify.

We had filed for my kids passports but we knew they would not be back in time for spring break. So, we started researching areas that didn't require passports. Read a ton of reviews and decided on the Rio Mar. I had read that it was expensive, so that wasn't a surprise. We didn't get a car because we have 3 young kids and felt it would be more trouble and time/money saved just to use the resort facilities. Ouch! one of our dinners ended up being around $400 for a family of 5--that's not with teenagers either. Mind you, my husband did order a nice bottle of wine. I really think Rio Mar should offer an all-inclusive program for those who don't want to venture off property. In fact, for the amount they charged us, it should have been all-inclusive. Anyway, here are my problems. First, we arrived at the hotel around 3pm on a Friday and like other reviewers, our room was not ready. According to the front desk lady, our view would be worth the wait. Huh? We had to wait about 1-1/2hrs. We had not had a proper lunch so we went to eat to pass the time. Then, I had paid high dollar for this trip and spent extra for an ocean view. Although we were on the 7th(top) floor, we only had partial ocean view due to being at the end of the east wing. We did have a full frontal view of the lovely(UGLY) roof equipment though..... Service is very inconsistent here. One day on our way to dinner we had to go to stop at the front desk to inform them that our room had not yet been cleaned--IT WAS 6PM! I also handed the front desk lady(wish I had got her name--she was shocked that our room hadn't been cleaned and very apologetic) a list of a few items we needed in our room like another blanket for the baby crib, some shaving cream and a nail file and the bathrobes that were suppose to be in every room to begin with. She didn't do her job either. I had to ask 3 different people and finally got some service by directly talking to the housekeeping gal on our floor. We received turn-down service 2 nights but not the other 3. I almost felt that if you didn't slip these staff people a tip, they would do NOTHING to help you. One of my biggest problems was the beach. My family loves the beach. We arrived on Friday, March 21 and the beach was just atrocious--that's not an understatement. The water was unswimmable and the beach was disgustingly littered (YES! GARBAGE people) and hoards of seaweed, driftwood, rotten coconuts, you name it. This didn't get cleaned up properly until Tuesday, March 25. I tried to make excuses for them like saying it was the holiday Easter weekend and maybe they were understaffed. Apparently, they had bad storms prior to our arrival but for a property of this calibre, there is no excuse for such shoddy property management. Once they did clean it up, we all had a wonderful time playing in the ocean. Another time the front desk woman(wish he had gotten her name--it was probably the same gal as I dealt with--eek, or could there be more) was rude to my husband when he needed to have another key made for our room. The pools are nice. The water slide is great fun for the kids. I would recommend to people with young children that they wear some sort of water shoe though. My 2 yr old slipped and hit his head really hard while playing around the kiddie pool area sprinklers. Rio Mar should really address this problem because I saw many people wipe out, including a few adults. I guess I'm done.... I do want to compliment the Concierge Desk. I did have excellent service from Louis and Eric.

We rented through Rio Mar Villa Rentals (http://www.resortvillarentals.com). We enjoyed the resort, our villa, and the area, but we would have enjoyed it more if we had planned better. Our villa was a 2-bedroom, 2-bath, with 2 balconies, full kitchen, washer/dryer, and nice furnishings. There were a few items missing when we checked in, such as bowls and plates. The conceirge, who is on-site most days from at least 9-5, quickly brought us what we needed. If you rent an Ocean Villa and do not use the website I referenced above, you can not use the on-site concierge service. I highly recommend going through this professional, courteous rental team. If you are traveling with small children, a car is a must. I met a mom over at the Wyndham, who had used the hotel's shuttle service to get there from the airport. She had no way to get back out to the store to buy formula for her baby. One problem with getting out of the resort is that the intersection with route 3 can get very backed up, easily adding 10-15 minutes to a trip off the resort. Plan accordingly. Puerto Rico is a very Catholic island, and we arrived on Good Friday. Almost all the stores and restaurants on the island (off-resort) were closed. Be careful around holiday times! We were traveling with 3 adults and a 2-year old, so diapers and beers were desperately needed. There are 2 shopping areas nearby. Heading east on route 3, the main road, the first shopping area is 3 lights away (15 minutes with no traffic). There is a Walgreens and Amigos, grocery store, there. The next shopping area is 5 lights away (20 minutes with no traffic) and includes a 24-hour Walgreens, grocery store, and Walmart. Thankfully, the 24-hour Walgreens was open on Good Friday. We enjoyed breakfast and lunches in our villa, which helped us save money over the resort prices. We did eat all of our dinners out. Our favorite dinner was at Aqualuna. Unlike other reviewers, we found plenty of diversity with the fish dishes. The portions were smaller, so be sure to order enough side dishes or appetizers. The Wyndham resort, unlike the Ocean Villas, was crowded over the weekend. We did not make dinner reservations for some of the nights, and ended up having to eat at Marbella twice. The food was very good, and there was something for everyone in our group. The alcoholic drinks were priced about right for New York city, so be prepared for that. The gift shop does sell a limited selection of liquor, along with beer and wine. If you are going off resort, it is good to know that gas stations and groceries store stock all alcohol: beer, wine, and liquor. You will, though, need a little bit of Spanish to get the better liquors out of their locked cabinets. When the resort is not as crowded (after Easter, this seemed to be the case), then the restaurants will be randomly closed on different nights. I highly recommend that you choose your restaurants a day or two ahead of time. You can call a \"dinner reservations\" line to make all your reservations. Our 2-year old loved the daily iguna feedings, the pools, and the playground over at the resort. Our villa was stocked with pool towels. It's still not clear if guests at the Ocean Villas can use the towel service at the Wyndham. Regardless, we were able to exchange our beach towels from the villa for new ones at the Wyndham (which means they probably were \"taken\" from there to begin with). When ordering drinks or food from the Wyndham, we were sure to mention that we were staying at the Ocean Villas, so we could not charge to a room. The staff easily accomodated us by charging to our credit card. A couple of final notes about the Ocean Villas. The directions provided to us to the Ocean Villas were wrong. Be sure to print out the directions directly from the Wyndham site. The Ocean Villas claim to be a 5-minute walk to the main resort. This might be true for some sprinters, but it is at least 10 minutes to the pools. The beach in front of the Ocean Villas was not maintained as nicely as the hotel. There was a lot of seaweed, which I can accept, but also a lot of trash. They cleaned it up the day before we left, but your best bet is to use the beach down closer to the hotel.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NEW JERSEY", "Title": "\u201cNo hotel privelages at Villas\u201d", "Author": "MOMOF2B", "ReviewID": "UR14603771", "Content": "We just returned from renting a two bedroom Golf Villa at Wyndham Rio mar. We stayed in Cluster 1. The villa was very nice and huge. The resort is clean and well kept. First off I want to let other travelers know...you do not really have previlages at the hotel, for example you can not get towels and sort of have to \"sneek\" into themain pool area. While you can use the facilities you have to use your credit card. Upon using the \"beach club\" at the Ocean Villas, we were actually asked for our room number and then told to leave, b/c we were not staying at an ocean villa. Overall the trip was good once I got over feeling like we were doing \"something wrong\" by sneeking into the main pool. The food is expensive at the resort but i is not as bad as everyone else reviewed. In fact Palio and Shimas were quite good. Another bonus is that all the resturaunts have the same kids meal so everything is very family freindly. We rented our villa through VRBO and it came with a golf cart which saved us $10 a day in PARKING. Our cluster and clusters 2 and 3 are close enough to the golf country club that you could walk over to take the shuttle. But again you may be asked your room number etc. Note it is way too far to walk with all your stuff to the resort from any villas. In conclusion, I would recommend getting clear information form whomever you rent from about which pools and beach you are really allowed to use and where it is ok to park your golf cart. You do save a lot of money in a villa and the space is great, maybe in an off season time they do not enforce the \"where are you staying rule\"", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cexpensive\u201d", "Author": "fourthrho", "ReviewID": "UR14589148", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed from the 16-20 of March. The food was expensive and mediocre at best. $50 for hamburger and chicken wrap sandwich w. 2 drinks...ouch! The beach was rough and the sand reminded me of dirt. They charge $25 to rent a fridge. Twice by \"accident\". ( was credited afterwards). Was charged for parking when we didn't have a car. (was credited afterwards) Went on a wonderful horseback ride ($72/person for 2 hours). When we got there, they asked if we were going on the 1 hour or 2 hour ride. My boyfriend and I looked @ ea. other because we were under the assumption that the 2 hr. ride (booked through the hotel) was our only option. Enjoyed the ride but later complained to Raquel/Rachel in which she credited us 10% of the bill. She was very nice and professional. Unlike the lady at concierge w. the short hair cut. She practically ignored me when I approached her at the desk....kept her head down and was typing while I stood there for atleast a minute. Finally, another concierge assisted me (only after the rest of them were confused about the whole ordeal). I complained about her unprofessionalism to Rachel as well. She assured me that she would handle that. Bedding was another issue. Gross.... blood and other stains on the comforter inside of the duvet. Give me a break! Spoke to Ana (head of made service). After a few weak attempts to correct the problem, I finally called her up to see for herself. Finally, everything was re-placed with fresh and clean linen; straight from the dryer. We rented an expensive car( but managed to get a discount from my job $56 /15% off...highly recommend trying to get a discount from AAA or wherever) on the 3rd day we wanted to go to Old San Juan, parking is free the 1st night. Next day a bill for $15 parking. Spoke to Carrol (this is a man with waxed eye-brows... how U doin?) Anyways, he had the audacity to say that he never heard of parking being free the first night and he's been there 4 a year. Needless to say, my boyfriend and I had enough with the shenanigans from this hotel and wanted to break his neck. He was very arrogant and treated us as if we were lying. (We were right and he was wrong). It was removed from the bill. Needless to say, seconds later, another guests was up and arms with him. Went to timeshare presentation, stayed an hour, wanted to leave, received $75 but no trip. Went back the next day and the lady said she forgot... oh brother! Chose Hawaii over Florida but the hotel in Hawaii does not look good. So, we'll see! Recommendations: Antojitos, Carabali Bar n Grill - Rio Grande area (this also has the horseback riding with a stop at the Mamayes River) food was great...gotta go there! Angus steak and lobster tail $30. Old San Juan, Castillo Fort, Old Harbor Restaurant-OSJ. Rent the car by the day so that you can get the 1st day of free parking as it is expensive as well to park at the hotel. I do not recommend Wyndham Rio Mar. If you do stay check your bill and be prepared to pay $$$ especially the taxi and deal with arrogant people :( PS. The Timewarner people were chanting 7:30 in the morning.

We were sadly SO disappointed! My husband and I have stayed at several resorts around the world and Rio Mar was by a long stretch, the least value for money. Firstly, Walking into Rio Mar felt like we had walked into a conference .There were business executives walking around with their conference badges (who looked like THEY needed a vacation!). So please know that this isn't a 'quiet or exclusive' resort. It's choc-o-bloc with business travelers. An extension of the point above - Everything is priced like you have an expense account. We ate at 3 restaurants and each meal averaged $75 (not including taxes) There were *MANY* entrees and appetizers that were repetitive across the restaurants, especially between Marbella (the breakfast place) and Aqua Luna (the more formal restaurant). The entrees at Aqua Luna wasn't anything to rave about and the staff ( manager included ) couldn't make any worthwhile wine recommendations. Shimas - the sushi restaurant was lovely and we would highly recommend it. Some housekeeping stuff that left us perplexed - 1) Most mornings we were out and when we returned at noon, the room service hadn't come in to clean the room. For 4 days in a row, they came in only close to 4pm. 2) They do not replace the first complimentary bottle of water with a 'pay as you consume' bottle which is the case in all resorts we have been too. When my husband enquired they said, above the cost of the bottle, there would be a $5 room delivery fee! 3) After we discovered that the minibar in our room was locked, we were told that the minibars don't function - they have stopped providing this service all together !! So the minibar is like a piece of furniture :) We did however enjoy the beach and the pools !!

This is a beautiful hotel, but it is very expensive. I am lucky that I only had to pay for incidentals, but we did eat a few meals on our own and were very disappointed. There is not a whole lot to do on the resort other than gamble, swim, drink, and eat, so rent a car or take advantage of the excursions that the hotel will book for you (for a price). Overall, I would not book this hotel unless I got a great deal, but for those of you where money is no object, this is a fantastic place to take a vacation. FOOD & DRINK A mixed drink was between 6.50-10.50, and beer was $5 for a Medalla (local beer, delicious!) at the Tiki Hut, or $6.50 inside at the lobby bar and at the restaurants. We ate twice at Marbella and it was about $65 each time for two sandwiches and two beers each. And the food was not good. We actually ordered about 12 beers one day from room service because the Medalla was only $4 and it worked out to be cheaper even with the service charge and tip. We also bought some rum and mixers from the gift shop for about $35 which lasted us the rest of our trip, so that saved us a bunch of money too. The \"fridge\" in the room is actually just a cooler, so load up on ice to keep beer cold unless you rent a fridge. GROUNDS Beautiful. The landscaping was impeccable, there was never a branch or leaf out of place. The beach is very nice, although we didn't spend much time there due to a storm that closed all the beaches. There are little biting ants in some of the grassy areas, my husband got a nasty bite, so use bug spray! DECOR Very nice, I absolutely loved the art that hung on the walls around the resort. I spent a lot of time looking at the hanging art as well as the various sculptures around the resort and was really pleased with it. ROOMS Great! Big cushy bedding, plenty of fluffy pillows and soft towels and Bath & Body works amenities. The bathroom was big and the terrace was small but nice with a great view. Everything was spotless. POOL Cold. But nice to look at. CASINO Teeny tiny, if you are used to Vegas, please lower your expectations for Puerto Rico! But it was nice, the dealers were mostly friendly, and the crowd was usually pretty good. The free drinks that the website touts are really only plentiful at night, my husband and I sat for two hours and even asked the dealer to send a waitress and none ever came. Only as we were playing our last hand the pit boss came by and asked the other guy at the table if he wanted one because he had just lost $500 in about 30 minutes. So I guess if you want a drink in the daytime, lay out a load of cash first! Oh and the players club is not great if you are only betting $100 a day, I think I had $5 in comps at the end of my week.

There are many reviews highlighting the bulk of the problems, so I will try to just hit the low notes. 1. I arrived without a reservation, yet despite being a Whyndam By Request ember (which is their version of a priority guest) , despite the fact that the hotel advertised a web price of $228, the hotel would not honor this, even after confirming that I was correct, they stuck fastidiously to their walk in rate of $269. Despite the fact that it was out of season and the hotel was only 35% full. 2. At no time was I advised of the hotel policy of 14% resort charge, which for me came to $37 per night. In season, this charge can run $50 - 60 per night. 3. What does the resort fee cover you would ask? Because I was still charged a valet parking fee of $21 per night inc tax (self parking 200 yards away is $15). And this despite the fact that most guests wait 10 - 15 minutes for their car, even when there is no one else waiting! Twice we arrived at valet to find no one was on duty, and we waited 10 minutes for someone to saunter back from lunch. I guess this is the consequence of being prepaid for a service. 4. Two drinks at Marabella restaurant, which is a Denny's take off, one double rum and coke and a miniscule glass of house white wine $25. Entrees $25 - 50, side salad $11-14. 5. The off color khaki sand beach was littered with garbage, some half buried, some laying obviously on top of the sand. Add to this the dirty stained plastic strap cheap beach chairs, the ambience speaks for itself. 6. The first night we stood behind twelve people waiting for a seat at the only \"open\" roulette table. When I asked the pit boss if he would be opening another table, he snarled \"No!\" 7, Two out of three days housekeeping forgot to replenish coffee, sugar, sweeteners etc. Which is a necessity unless you are taking the $25 breakfast. Unless you are Puerto Rican, I have to question why anyone from overseas would come here. The hotel lacks atmosphere, there is absolutely nothing to do for kids and teenagers after dark, nor adults for that matter. Having been to the very expensive Paradise Island and loving it, I feel at least there you get great service, great food, incredible beaches, dozens of water rides, excellent restaurants, great entertainment and innumerable things to do.

Great Hotel and Staff\u201d", "Author": "fcn78", "ReviewID": "UR14399395", "Content": "We returned a couple of days ago from a week at The Wyndham Rio Mar. It was a great time. I'll split the review up a bit to try to hit all areas of the trip: Travel Arrangements: You should honestly rent a car for this trip. The hotel is a little far away from everything but the rainforest and a car rental is pretty cheap there. You will appreciate all the money you save on tours if you have a car. Directions from Airport to Hotel: From the airport, take Route 26 towards 66. 66 becomes a toll road is will cost you $1.50. It will bring you to Route 3. You make a right onto Route 3. Your marker is the Baelz Outlet Mall. The hotel is about 5- 10 minutes up Route 3. There are signs; you make a left and it's up the hill. Parking: If you self park at the hotel, it will cost you $15 a day. Each day you leave the hotel, you bring your ticket to the valet desk and the scan it so you can put it in the machine to get out of the deck. To save on parking, we went to the Timeshare presentation. They gave us $100 and a vacation voucher to Hawaii for 4 nights at a hotel in Maui. Worked out well, because it ended up paying for all of our parking and we only had to spend an hour listening to the presentation. Hotel Accommodations: We were booked for a resort view room. I called a week before we got there and asked for a free upgrade to oceanview, When we arrived, they weere not able to accommodate that request. After a couple of minutes of asking really nicely, they put us in a rainforest view room which I honestly think was best. The view was amazing! The room was very comfortable and well decorated. The best part, it was clean. Food: We did not eat at the hotel at all because we read other reviews that the prices were outrageous. There are a couple of resturants very close by. When you are coming out of the hotel and make a right to go up the hill a bit, there is a resturant called Ritche's. It is an outdoor traditional Puerto Rican resturant and it was excellent. It's pretty much family run. Ritchie comes to your table! There is a breathtaking view of the ocean and the food was good. We enjoyed it so much, we went back twice. Ritchie even remembered us. There is another resturant just passed Ritche's. It was ok. Cheap! I can't remember the name, but it's worth trying. The one resturant you SHOULD NOT go to is Antijito's which is on the same street as the hotel. As you are turning on the street from Rt. 3, it's the first resturant there. The food was awful. The service was pretty bad. That was the only thing I did not like about the food for the week. Things to do: The hotel is beachfront so we spent a day at the beach. The water was a bit choppy and the waves were cresting around 7- 8 feet. I actually got caught in one and ended up bottoming out and tearing up my knee. After that, I was done with the water there. Taking a walk on the beach was goregous. If you walk up the beach, there are small coves which are beautiful. You will even get views of beach and rainforest in the same picture. If you're in Puerto Rico, you should go to Old San Juan at least once. There is great shopping and really interesting little shops and streets to wander through. Great Jewelry stores also! There are lots of great little resturants down there too. It was a great time. We drove up to Farjado and took a Catamaran cruise to the caribbean side of Puerto Rico. There were great pictures and we were able to go snorkeling. The boat we went on was the Spread Eagle II and the crew was great. They serve lunch and bring you to two areas to snorkel off of. It's also a Rum cruise so that was fun too. You have to go to the Rainforest if you are staying literally across the street from it. Little hint; you do not have to pay to get into the rainforest. The Concierge at the hotel will give you a map, and you can drive and hike through it for free. There were amazing views of the beach and landscape. There are also a couple of goregouse waterfalls. Great trip; great hotel; great value.

We loved the Wyndham and would definitely go back. I am very glad that I read the reviews before I went...by following some advice of others, it made our stay a great one. If you want a GREAT stay remember these suggestions: 1) Rent a car either at the airport (or online through Priceline/Hotwire). We rented a full size for $19 per day unlimited mileage through Priceline and got a car from the budget rental at the airport. Do NOT wait to rent one from the hotel as it is ridiculously expensive. You will be so glad you have a car to go to restaraunts, stores, rainforest, other trips, etc... 2) Call ahead/email the hotel and request an oceanview on the 6th or 7th floor...then confirm this when you check in. We did this and received a GREAT room with a BEAUTIFUL view. If you get a room on the 6th or 7th floor, you will be above the palm trees and have a direct view of the ocean...very nice. 3) Pick up a few groceries on the way (drinks, snacks,etc.)...the food/drinks are $$$ and the rooms have a small refrigerator (really more like a large cooler) and plenty of cabinet space next to it. 4) Eat outside of the resort...there are 2 restaraunts up the hill with beautiful views (Ritchies and ?). Food just okay...atmoshpere is great. There are bakeries and small restaurants off Rt. 3, La Parilla (kiosk at Laquillo Beach) is really yummy. If you do these things, you will be very happy with your stay. Staff: Very friendly and very professional. Kids Club: Other reviews said it was more like a \"day care\"...I disagree. Although there were many kids at the resort while we were there, no one used the kids club except us. Our 3 year old surprisingly wanted to stay...and wanted to return the next day even though she was the only one there. When we picked her up, we saw why. While she was there for only 3 hours she had her hair braided with beautiful beads (she really looked cute), she made a butterfly with beads, she swam in the pool and played on the slide, she went to the beach, played on the play ground and they took a picture of her and she made a cute frame out of it with shells. She loved it. It is pricey, but worth it. They have 1/2 day with lunch, full day with lunch, and night sitting...we only did 1/2 day which was either 9-12 or 1-4. Beach: Great!! At first glance, I will admit that I was a little disappointed that the sand was brown and not white...but it is soft, with clear and calm water, many shells, and great for taking long walks. Pool: Great!! Water slide, plenty of chairs, large, and there are hammocks around and very comfortable cabana-type tents with cushioned lounges and fans above for cover. The grounds surrounding the pool are beautiful and lush. There is also a childern's playground. Rooms: Great!! Beautiful views, nice and clean rooms, wonderful large bath with great shower, comfortable beds, large flat screen tvs with many movie options, mini frig, balconies overlooking beautiful views of ocean or El Yunque rainforest. Food: $$ and not very great. My son ordered room service and it was priced typically for a nice hotel...but food not so great.

The service seemed to be better this time (according to my wife, as I didnt really recall prior service). We didnt use the kids club at all. The pool was great (kids loved the slide, which helped tire them out for nap time). Rumor has it there is an adult pool - would love to be able to see it at some time. The beach was fine, sand is kinda dirty looking but was ok (its not a beautiful sandy white beach, if that's what you are looking for). Room was adequate - if we go again, need to price out some kind of suite, since the kids go to be early, nowhere to watch tv, read, etc. - they could add a light on the balcony for that purpose. Food - very expensive, as noted throughout the reviews. The breakfast buffet was $25 pp, but they didnt charge us for our kids, which was nice. The kids menu (essentially the same at every restaurant) is the only reasonably priced items (approx $6 per item). We ate at Shima the first night, extremely limited menu. Aqualuna was actually very tasty, ate there the second night. Expect to pay at least a $100 per couple, without drinks. We ate at Antojintos (sp) at the bottom of the hill one night, it was pretty good ($50 or so). The following night we went to La Parilla (based on recommendations here) - scary location, but once inside was nice, sat near the back, view of the ocean, lots of locals with horses ($80). The last night we had pizza delivered from Antonitio's (concierge has flyer) - pizza was not very good, but passable, wings were pretty bad as well - sat by the ocean bar and ate. (heard that Ismar bakery's pizza was terrible, fyi, from a fellow traveler, so we got the other name from the lifeguard).

The food is certainly not gourmet, but the location cannot be beat--both in its proximity to the Rio Mar and its spectacular view. Both night we were greated by Richie, who is a wonderful host. The weather was perfect everyday and the ocean ideal for swimming. We also enjoyed the adult pool, and I took the occasional trip down the waterslide in the activity pool. Tennis facilities were great.

I am writing this from the perspective of a couple looking for a short getaway. First of all Puerto Rico was better than expected, U.S. dollars and industry have created a strong infrastructure and jobs, good roads, downside Mc D's, BK, Costco and WalMart but, as it is in the states handy when needed. Back to the resort, rented a car so as not to be captive for the price $150 for 5 days a good idea considering grnd transport from airport approx $75 each way, downside they rip you for $20/dy valet parking, $15 Self believe me no shortage of parking just a scam, tip loose or don't use tickets when getting your car and you might miss a couple of billings. Moving on, the staff is great friendly and helpful. Not that I saw all the rooms but, we were waterfront west 2114 very nice only negative is conference crowd was using facilities below but, no later than 11pm not really a problem and somewhat fun. Room was nice, all tile very good bath. Bedding was phenomenal 800 +tc sheets and great pillow top heaven. Open the door no a/c needed. Again nick and dime on the Internet in room $14.95 /dy glossed over because free wireless in lobby not what I wanted but, adequate for a quick connect. Pools are nice, cabanas available with reservation didn't use not closely checked. Little water slide if you have kids but, nothing to write home about. Beach is nice, sand is brown not white but soft and free of stones, and shells if you like shells out of luck. Restaurants; Palio nice and good but, expensive very but, alternatives in the area not great, which include Richie's up the hill great view, food average not too expensive definitely go if clear, Antojellos misspelled but, down the hill, no atmosphere, food average at best probably better for break, lunch. Day trip to Culebra Isle was great awesome beach and local beach vendor food. Eat the Pastalilos after you get of the boat at the restaurant waterfron on the left side of the strip awesome. It is a long boat ride about 75 mins but, only $2.50. Plane costs $25.00 might want to boat out and plane back. Don't bother with hotel trip to same place unless no car. That's it don't usually write but, was compelled. The place doesn't need updating at leat what I saw of it, sour grapes by those who may have gotten a bumb room of location ask for something else. Play golf but, hate it the courses looked nice didn't play. Never went to the gym which is unusual for me, so can't comment never even looked at it.

My girlfriend and I went to the Wyndham from 2/14 to 2/18. We read a ton of reviews on this site and others, did our homework, and this is the place we decided to go (she didn't have a passport so other travel places in the Carib. were limited). Needless to say, if you've read any reviews about this place, you've read mixed reviews like we did. First of all, when we finally landed in PR, we were originally going to get a taxi but just decided to get the shuttle that runs directly from the airport to the hotel ($60 per person for a round trip). Right when you get down the stairs at the airport, there is a huge sign for the hotel and someone there who can make all the arrangements. They just found my name on the reservations list (good thing it was listed) and it was charged directly to the room. They give you these passes for the return trip, but the driver never asked for them. The charter bus was air conditioned with big windows and the driver was real nice, so I think that was better than having to deal with a cab in a country we had never been (if you have a map and rent a car, the drive looks pretty easy tho). When we checked in, I asked for a king instead of the two queens that Orbitz said, and the front desk receptionist (really nice) said they didn't have any kings left so they upgraded our room to a partial view. The room was awesome, 7th floor, partial view of the ocean. Since we were on a somewhat budgeted trip, this was a surprise to have a room so nice. (no bugs ever, bathroom was super clean, maid service everyday, new towels everyday). The only thing with the hotel room is don't plan on using the mini fridge unless you want to get charged everyday, and don't open any bottles of water because we heard they are about 5 or 6 bucks each. After we were all settled we just went to the valet and they hailed a cab for us that was onsite. (You can't really walk off the resort on the road beacuse the entrance is about a mile away and its guarded, so a cab was just easier). We just told the cabbie to take us to a grocery store (it helps to know a little spanish) and there we got all the food needed for breakfast, lunch, alcohol (they sell bottles in the gift shop at the hotel but its 3x the American price, anywhere else off the resort it was about $8 for a fifth of rum). Also, don't plan on buying cigars at the resort either because naturally, they are way overpriced. I made the mistake of not bringing any, but the convience store at the corner of the entrance had some. After all those trips, the cab driver only charged us $40 (were from DC so were used to that). The second day we walked east down the beach for a few miles and came across a strip of stores near a public beach (when you are on the beach and you see a billboard, the stores are right there). Go to La Parilla, easily the best food we had ever tasted (we walked back the last night we were there again). Get the fried pork with plantains and the garlic chicken. Each time we went, with dinner, drinks, and tip it was only about $40. The resort pretty much dies at night, but we had read this in other reviews. Go here if you want to basically just relax on the beach and do nothing. They have a bar on the beach but its super expensive, so I just brought down a cooler with drinks and nobody bothered us. They have chairs already out on the sand and if you want they can even put your umbrella in the sand for you. It was a mixed crowd, with the beach having some families and some couples like us. You can just keep pulling your chairs down the beach so it isnt too crowded. They had a kid pool and a adult pool, which shockingly had no kids. They also have waiters at the pool that can bring you whatever overpriced food/drink you want. Overall, awesome trip. Would def go back again if we could get a good deal. Would probably rent a car just so we could explore more. About 200 yards either way down the beach its deserted.

We were part of a modest sized group. On a scale of 1 to 10, our opinion, TWO. First, we were to have received a lower group rate of $369 a night, however, what no one told us is that the hotel adds on a \"Resort Service Fee 8%\", so the room is about $30 more per night. This hidden charge is, in our opinion calculated to fool the traveller and we believe is unethical and dishonest, since the room charge is not $369 but $369 plus $29.52 per night. The Hotel also added a bellman charge, but did not advise us when we checked in so we unnecessarily also tipped the bellman. Also added in was a room housekeeping gratuity charge, which we were also not advised of but discovered when we asked for the bill the night before checking out. We also discovered one of our rooms (we had 4) was overcharged because of a mistake, but the night manager would not attend to it at the time and since we were leaving at 5 am the next day there was nothing that we could do. The night manager was less than helpful and we do not expect much more from the hotel manager, Mark Stevenson, whom we will send the information contained herein. The hotel staff appeared to be more concerned with attending to a convention group of 600 there at the same time than our modest sized group as well as small groups or individuals. Worst yet was the meal service: Lunch at the hotel. A patio restaurant. If you were served in less than an hour after you gave your order (and you had to sit at a table to give an order since they would not take the order in advance) you could consider yourself among the fortunate. Staff alternated between unconcerned or \"could care less.\" A turkey burger sandwich with a piece of tomato that was inedible and not ripe. Dinner - although the actual food in the restaurants was tasty, the kitchen was either understaffed or incompetent. We made advance reservations at 3 restaurants for each night there and the earlest we were served was in the Japanese (an hour). The other two (the Italian and fish restaurants) averaged from an hour and a quarter to over an hour and a half after we gave our order. By the time the food came the children were tired and cranky, the parents were also the same and the experience was more unpleasant each day. Moreover, we made reservations at the early time of 6 p.m and were one of the first ones in eacfh restaurant so we could get moderately quick service - if we had come later I think a sleeping bag would have been necessary. Rooms were clean and fine and housekeeping staff was excellent. Golf course staff helpful. But these positives could not overcome all the negatives. All in all, if I had a choice for a vacation resort in PR, it would NOT be the RIo Mar and I an inclined to think this is a Wyndham problem also so we will make it our business to avoid the Wyndham chain in the future.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western NY", "Title": "\u201cWorked well for us.

Puerto Rican drivers scared me a little. I think that the hotel is stunningly beautiful. The lobby has a great view of the beach and the Ocean. The grounds are impeccably maintained. The staff was very friendly and efficient. We stayed 5 nights in a \"junior suite\". The interior of the room was great. However, as a previous poster said, our \"view\" was of the roof of the 4th floor- very bad. Also we had some constant noise from the AC units on the roof. If I had paid mucho $$, I would have complained, but I did not. The self parking was very poorly run. We paid $15/day instead of $20/day for valet. I did this because I did not want to have to tip every time we picked up the car. Every time we wanted to get the car, we had to have the ticket validated near the lobby, then go to the parking garage that took 2 elevators. A waste of time. The pool was great, and the beach pretty nice. We enjoyed going to the hot tub around 9 PM. We were usually the only people there. I like to play tennis and called the tennis center looking for someone to play with. They set me up with another guest which was great. Nice courts. Note: they charge $10 per rental of a racket so bring your own if you can. We avoided the hotel restaurants after reading so many comments about their excessive cost. Instead, we ate at local restaurants which we enjoyed. Lots of fried bananas. We took excursions on our own. We went horseback riding in the rainforest, hiked El Yunque, kayaked bio bay, snorkeled and visited Old San Juan. In each case, arranging things ourselves, and driving ourselves saved about 40% from what the hotel would charge. The bio bay was diminished by the full moon- beware. For us, the highlight was our first snorkeling trip. We used the \"Salty Dog\". The captain and crew were terrific. The snorkeling was amazing. Also be advised that the concierges and towel collectors are hawking a timeshare presentation for Wyndham. We had heard about these and were curious, so we attended. The hotel offered \"breakfast\", a 5 day 4 night future trip in either St. Thomas or Florida and either a couples spa treatment or $75 credit. They promised no high pressure. Our sales rep was long winded, but when we said no, so accepted it. The breakfast was a joke- water, coffee and packaged muffins.

Much of what I say or could say is probably repiticious of things said in the 400 plus reviews before us, so I will try and add a few new perspectives.This was our 6th trip to Puerto Rico in the last 5 years. We have stayed at least twice at the Condato Plaza (formerly a Wyndham) and the Marriott, both in the Condato area of San Juan and the Hampton Inn on Isle Verde near the airport. This resort which is about 30 miles East of San Juan has them all beat. It is a beautiful property in what appears to be part of a planned community of over 500 acres which includes not only this resort, but condominiums, time shares, one or two 18 hole golf courses etc. The only downsides are the expensive restaurants (which could easily cut their prices by 30%, do more business, make more money and still be above other restaurant prices) and the sound proofing issue. They should hire the company who construced the Hampton Inn near the Airport as an example of good sound proofing. With these 2 issues taken care of I would easily raise my rating to 5 stars. A special plus must be given to the smoke free Casino which is a rarity outside of Canada and made my $80 donation to the Casino Black Jack fund a little more palatable. The staff at the resort goes above and beyond to be helpfull. There are 4 (yes 4) Concierges avaiable duing the day. As for restaurant recommendations off the resort property they not only give you an extensive list in writing, but answer questions you may have on each and give you preprinted driving direction for each and any other place else you may want to go. We had our 2 dinners out at Antojitos about 5 minutes from the resort and at La Parilla about 15 minutes from the resort. Both offered tasty Puerto Rican food (meat or chicken with beans and sauce over rice) at normal restaurant prices. We also spent one morning driving thru the El Yunqke National (rain) Forest which starts about 15 minuites from the resort. The resort is in fact in Rio Grande, as opposed to being in the El Yunque Natioal Forest as listed by Trip Adviser. One pleasnt surprise which was referenced in only 1 previous review which I read was the Isamar Bakery and Pizzaria which is located at the intersection of Highway 3 and 968 before you enter the resort. Not only are the prices more than reasonable but their baked goods were delicious as were their sandwiches and provided our needs for both of our breakfasts and lunches. The clientele at Isamar is mostly local and the adjoining busineses appeared to be a little seady. This however shoul not deter you as the only alternatve at the resort is the ERB stand next to the Casino where the prices on comparable items are 2 to 4 times as expensive and they are not as good as Isamar.. If your desire is to enjoy a luxurios resort without the husle, bustle and night life of San Juan, you will not be disapointed.

We were a little uncertain about booking the Rio Mar after reading some of the reviews. While some of the comments are true, we had a fantastic time. The resort is beautiful and easy to get to from San Juan. You definitely should rent a car though. It will save you a lot of money in the long run if you plan on going into old San Juan for a visit and travelling to other places outside the resort. Our first day, we arrived late afternoon and self parked the car ($15 a day, no free parking). We had some drinks at the Tiki Bar on the beach. The Tiki Bar is expensive but a great location and enjoyable. We loved the beach at the resort and the pool as well- both are side by side to each other and very relaxing. They put out chairs on the beach and the swimming and walks on the beach are great- well supervised and cared for beach. The pools are beautiful with nice chairs, jacuzzi, and a nice adult only pool. We had dinner our first night at Antojitos- a local place down the street from the resort. This place was FANTASTIC and very cheap, great ambiance. The next day we played golf. Expensive and wet courses but enjoyable. We played the first 9 of the Ocean course but only a few holes on the back 9 are on the ocean. Practice range is included in greens fees and the clubhouse locker room is nice. We had lunch at the clubhouse at Iguana Pub. Again, expensive but nice. Later that day, we had a drink at sunset at Richie's. It's a local bar right up the road from the resort with great views. We went for nice runs around the resort and worked out in the gym a few times, which is fairly nice. I had a very nice massage at the spa. The views from the resort are fantastic and the water is gorgeous. We enjoyed the sand even though some people say it's \"dark\". It's usually windy on the beach but we love the breeze. At night we would have a drink in the lobby bar which is a nice scene with a breezy patio and nice TV's located around the bar. It is also near the casino which always seems to be pretty lively at night. The casino tables are fun but the machines don't pay. Our second night we ate again off the resort at La Parilla, a kiosk restaurant a few miles down the road and it was excellent. In the mornings, we avoiding having breakfast at Marbella at the resort since we heard it wasn't any good. We usually grabbed some coffee and muffin/bagel at the snack stand next to the casino. Our third day, we drove into old San Juan, which is just gorgeous- a must! We went to El Morro near sunset and saw amazing colors and views. Later we had dinner in old San Juan at Baru which was highly recommended and fantastic. The entire time we were in Puerto Rico, the weather was great. When clouds or a bit of rain comes, it passes quickly. The only hiccup we experienced at the resort was all water was shut down one morning. But hey, it was back up and running within a few hours. We paid for a garden view but I asked for an ocean view. They said this was $100 more a day so we passed. But we ended up with a room on the west side of the resort so we actually had a view of the hillside behind the resort and the ocean in front of the resort so that was nice! People staying at the resort are extremely friendly and love toe chit-chat if you want. Yet the resort is also very relaxing and quiet but fun at the same time without it being a party-fest.

Arrival: My husband and I just spent 5 nights at this hotel. We booked on cheapcarribean.com and got a great deal. I was nervous about the trip after reading the posts but they did help a great deal. When we arrived at the airport we saw the Wyndham sign and the lady told us to go to the desk outside and we got on the shuttle. We didn't rent a car because we're from NYC and the last thing we wanted to do is drive. Plus the stressful driving, the $15/day fee, the chances of getting lost, etc all made it an easy choice. The shuttle is $120 for 2 people, roundtrip. Check-in When we got to the hotel (40 min later) the system was down and we had to walk around in our jeans and sweaters (we just got in from ny). We went back a few hours later complaining and we got a room. It was a room with 2 queen beds facing the front of the hotel. I walked right back down to the front desk (which is on the 3rd floor) and made a fuss. Unfortunately, it did me no good because the 'system was down and there was nothing they could do'! ok, so we spent our first night as newlyweds in separate beds-they're very small queens. The next morning we went back down, got a much nicer room on the 5th floor with a king bed....couldnt get ocean view but it was ok. It was very clean, had a fridge (which is a $25 charge per stay unless you booked before 12/31/07), his and hers sinks, a scale lol, a sofa, etc. So for the first night, we settled in and went to Richie's. We paid the cab $20 roundtrip, ate a lovely dinner and called it a night. The second day we spent on the beach and made another cab ride to a grocery store at the bottom of the hill across for Antojito's. There we picked up food since the restaurants at the hotel were ridiculously pricey. We got milk and cereal, peanut butter, jelly, bread, sodas, chips, cookies, etc. it was the best thing we couldve done! we ate once at the tiki bar-it wasnt even good-a crappy chicken sandwich and a burger with 2 drinks costs $60! the next day we headed to the rainforest. We took the hotel tour and paid $76 for 2 of us and our tourguide/driver, Harry was sooooooo much fun-he was hilarious and really made the trip fun.. the rainforest itself was beautiful! Lan mina waterfalls was breathtaking! The water was cold but it was definitely well work the money. Afterwards, Harry took us to the sam grocery store we went to the night before and picked up some lunch at Antojito's across the street. They have lunch specials for $4.75!! Its a buffet of rice, beans, salad, and your pick of three entrees: chicken, pork or bacalau (salted codfish). DELICIOUS!!!! We also went to Don Pepe's another night. It was not as nice a richie's but the food was great. we got so full on our nacho appetizer that we took an entire meal home and ate it later for dinner. The people were friendly, beach could have been kept a little more clean but the water was so warm, the waves were'nt rough...the pool was great-awesome slide...not for children only, i had a blast on the thing! They had water aerobics at 1pm, iguana feedings at 11am. that was all great fun as there wasnt so much to do most of the time. we got some great iguana pictures, got to pet them, and got some exercise in at the water aerobics in the pool. some things i was expecting but wasnt true of this hotel: water bottles at the fitness center-only a water cooler, no bottles smores at night on the beach-the place was deserted at night! music, dancing, puerto rican food! if i wanted sushi or italian, i would have stayed in NY! it was kinda boring-no offense to anyone but the hotel was full of middle aged people. no young couples-no nighlife at allllll besides the casino. the place is kinda boring but we just enjoyed our free time watching tv at night and going off the resort for dinners. gift shop stunk! everything said made in the philipines-ironic? lol and my poor husband wanted to read a newspaper...but not for $5.00!!!! we did love the lotion, shampoo, and other products. they were made by bath and bodyworks-smelled heavenly! The weather was great-it rained a few times but it pours for 10-15 min and clears up and the sun beams within minutes! It was 80-85 during the day and around 75 at night-absolutely perfect. DO wear sunscreen!!!! bugs werent really an issue at all! I bought bug spray bc people kept complaining about the bugs but really-the rainforst was bugfree- i know, thats so weird. i did get a few mosquito bites but that bc we left the balcony door open in the evening a a few snuck in. oh, everything is room charge...all the restaurants, bars, trips, etc all get chraged to your room. all u have to do is say room ####. NO id, no proof, nothing. so at checkout, we had charges that definitely were not ours...they took them off without a problem but clearly, people can say room 5520 when they are really in 6322 and there are no questions asked. so look out for that. i liked this hotel, i dont think ill come back....maybe when im 50 and i want to play golf lol but we did have a nice stay!", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAt best average, poor service,overpriced\u201d", "Author": "lovtravl", "ReviewID": "UR13342339", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights.

Was skeptical after reading some of the reviews on here, but I was pleasantly surprised. Granted, the food was in fact expensive, but that should be expected for a resort like this. Seems people are expecting Applebee's prices at a 5-star resort, not going to happen. Regardless, we found ways around this thanks to many helpful reviews on this site. The first thing we did was rent a car at the airport. As many posters have mentioned, this is a MUST. We got a car on travelocity for $98 for four days. Trust me, you will end up paying more in cab / shuttle fees if you don't rent a car. The one thing I didn't like was the PR drivers, they are the worst Ive ever seen. Be careful. After renting the car, we stopped on Rte. 3 at Amigo's, which is a grocery store like any other in the states. Ended up getting breakfast, snacks & beer for four days - bext decision we made. We would have paid out the ear for food at the hotel. Upon arrival we were treated nicely by the staff & checked in right away. We didn't get an upgrade because we booked through a thrid party, but they did give us a room with a King bed and partial ocean view which was nice. I highly recommend booking through skyauction.com - we ended up getting the room for $170 per night (includes all taxes & fees), which is about 50% off the rate on orbitz or travelocity. The only thing I didn't like was teh parking - it was $15 per overnight stay, but you have to get the ticket validated at valet each time you leave the garage. Another thing to be aware of is the fact that it rains a lot in PR. It rained the first day, so we ended up going to the El Yunque rainforest that day which was great. Again, you'll need a car to get there unless you want to pay the resort about $40 or so to take you there. The trails & sights are free if you have a car. Be sure to check out the La Mina falls - take the Big Tree trail to get there. The second day was clear outside, so we did a snorkel trip. This was the hilight of the trip. I recommend going on the spread eagle II trip (do an internet search for spread eagle puerto rico). It is lesser known than many of the other snorkel boats there, as was in evidence that day. We had about 25 people on a huge catamaran, while many other boats out that day were packed with what looked like 60 or more. The cost is $75 per person and includes snorkel gear and an all you can eat lunch. Best value on the trip. They take you to a secluded island off the east coast, and tropical fish eat out of your hand. It was great. Again, you'll need a car to get there as it is about 15 miles from the resort. The resort can take you snorkeling, but it will cost you a fortune. We hung out at the resort on day 3, and it was great. The beach is nice but don't expect a white sand beach of say Aruba. It was nice nonetheless, and the water was clear & warm. Also, the resort grounds are as people here describe - picture perfect. As for food, we ate at many of the restaurants folks here mentioned. Richie's is a must, but go just before sundown for an amazing sunset view. We also went into Old San Juan one day which was nice, reminded me of the French Quarter in N.O. a bit, but hilly like San Fran. Overall, I would highly recommend this place, but go in knowing that if you plan to eat at the hotel, it will be $$$.

We ended up taking a taxi offsite for dinner because we really felt like we were getting ripped off. We live in the Boston area, so it's not like we aren't used to pricey restaurants.

A magical Christmas Vacation. First, the only reason we chose Puerto Rico was because we realized (too late) that our passports had expired. Turned out to be a fortunate thing....

All was good..The kids enjoyed their morning football games on the huge green lawn area...Seemed like 20 kids of all ages on the field every morning, Was fun to watch..The beach was great, a little too rough some days (am told \"Christmas Winds\" tend to kick up a bit during late December) but others were good for boogie boarding, etc. though caution flags were out. Dave at the dive shop in the hotel was so nice, a wonderful man and a wealth of information. Gave us tips on where to go and what to do. Was even able to get us set up on a \"sold out\" excursion to The Bioluminescent Bay (which is quite an experience). But the real magic began when we met Felix, a great guy full of great stories, and his boat captain Tommy. They made our trip truly memorable. They took us (by boat) anywhere we wanted to go. You really need an experienced captain who knows the waters here.. We spent one day trolling for Kingfish (caught one too) and snorkeling in a beautiful island bay just off the mainland. .Tommy even taught the kids how to \" line fish\" by simply holding a line with a hook on it (no rod or reel) !

So we called up the manager and after fighting between the front desk, the manager and us, we finally got the room after about an hour. Our bags however took another two hours after we got our room to be delivered because of the room confusion. After all this confusion\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the remainder of our trip was pretty comfortable. The views from the resort were beautiful, the room was comfortable and the food was good. The beach was nice and we were able to get drinks (keep in mind it must be charged to your room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no cash) and we were able to rent jet skis. The location was convenient for the rain forest, which was amazing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6bring water and nice shoes especially if you are going swimming in the waterfall because it is a nice but long hike. Other than the forest the trip to the cities were not bad but took about a half an hour to 45 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.so next time I would stay in San Juan. We were able to drive to the cities and the Bacardi plant by jumping on the highway and paying a small toll.

The large beach is very nice with plenty of umbrellas and chairs available for hotel guests. They even have bar service right on the beach. Great free-form pools and nice hot tubs. Nice outdoor restaurant for lunch or snack right by the pool. We had supper at Marbella restaurant the first nignt. It was very good.

There is a bakery/ pizza shop a mile down from the hotel that serves breakfast for just a few dollars. Try Ritchie's for dinner. They are located up on the hill behind the hotel.

It was a great resort for families and included an on-site \"kids camp\" (for kids ages 4 and up), babysitters available, a playground and daily activities. Given that I was traveling with two young children, it was the perfect environment for my family. Note that there was not excessive programming (like you would find at Beaches, Club Med, or on a cruise). The property was beautiful and the staff was very attentive and pleasant. I cannot say enough good things about the staff. They pre-arranged restaurant reservations, babysitting, and spa services for me and throughout my stay were incredibly diligent and thorough. That said, the rooms were average, and I was highly disappointed to find that the \"partial ocean view\" that I booked required me to go out onto my balcony to actually see the ocean. There were two pools - a quiet pool and an activity pool - both pools were good but the beach was just ok. I didn't think it was as rough as other people had commented, though it wasn't as placid as other Caribbean islands. The food was good but expensive; given the family-friendly nature of the hotel, children were present at all of the restaurants. The Grille Room was particularly good, as was Palio. The spa was way overpriced. There were daily rainshowers and I couldn't tell if we were just there during the rainy season or if it's like this all of the time (because the hotel is right by the rainforest.

The hotel is set in fine grounds with attractive pools and a long sandy beach. However, the sea was very rough and it was not possible to swim in the sea. My main gripe is over the rooms. They are a good size but have two large beds which take up all the room. One king bed and arm chairs would be preferable. The first room I was given was at the back overlooking an ugly roof with loud noise from the air conditioning system. I asked for a move which was arranged after asking three times and was given a room with partial sea view. The air conditioning only blew ice cold air keeping the room at about 62 degrees so I had to turn it off as despite my complaining nothing was done. It was so cold at first that when I opened the door to the balcony the whole room was enveloped in condensation. The other problem was the lack of sound proofing between rooms, and I was kept awake one night until 2 am by next door's TV. All my colleagues were disappointed with their rooms at the back overlooking car parking or flat roof areas. Definitely make sure to book a sea facing room above the third floor. The restaurants were pricey, especially for wine which had exorbitant mark-up, and the food in the Asian restaurant was disappointing, whilst the Palio Italian was good. The location is less than ideal being so far from San Juan so that a car is really essential. The hotel shuttle is expensive and I paid $50 to go into Old San Juan.

When we arrived Otis at Check -in was extremely nice and asked about our trip in and if we were there for any special reason, it was our 10th anniversary. He upgraded our room to an Ocean Suite on the 5th floor which was a very nice surprise! The room was nice with a sitting area that had a couch, reading chair, coffee table and end tables and a desk area. We had a decent size balcony. Other reviews of the walls being thin is very true but we only had someone next to us 2 nights so it was not a big deal. The bathroom was off of the \"foyer\" area. The bathrooms could use a little work though, the vanities are nice with the granite and the tile floors but the shower/tub had two chips in them, the shower head was ancient and the shower was small. Over all the room was clean as was the bathroom, but like I said the shower/tub were old so there was no chance I would be taking a bath especially sine there is not much room to do so. The grounds are gorgeous like everyone said. You really can't describe the beauty of them and I don't think that the pictures do it justice either. From the moment that you drive into the resort you are stunned by the view straight out to the ocean and the beauty of the lush vegetation. We walked around the grounds and there are many iguana residents but they are not bothered by us, small getcos and coquis that you hear at night mainly. We sat on the beach everyday except for the last day where we sat at the quiet pool. The beach is very nice and we found a little palm tree heaven a little was down the beach that great for some privacy and shade if you didn't want to be in the sun all the time. The food was good but definitely pricey! Luckily our breakfast was included otherwise for the buffet everyday you are looking at around $60 for two including tip and taxes which are 7%, I live in Delaware so no tax that is why I was surprised at how high it was. Be careful though one day our waiter Kelvin who was not that attentive included the tip in the bill already and did not tell us luckily I was paying close attention going over the bill that day. I guess that explained his poor service since he know he already put in the tip. No other waiters did that thought. The buffett was plentiful and good, the pancakes, bacon, scrambled egss, etc. that were in servers could have been a little warmer. We ate at Palio which was delicious and not as outlandishly priced as I was expecting. The tiki bar by the beach is where we ate lunch and was ok food wise but the drinks were spectacular. This is the only place that we encountered a rude staff member and it was not so much to us as it was to another guest that was having lunch there. Needless to say after that day we did not see him there again and that was our second day there. I guess he must have been moved to another area. Definitely rent a car, it is a must! To get from the airport to the hotel is about 45 minutes and you only pay 1.50 toll if you take Rt.66 there. We self parked everyday for $15 a day, valet is $20 a day whcih I think is crazy to pay that much for the parking. It is great to have a car because the shuttle to the hotel is about $50-60 a person and then you are confined to the grounds unless you want to pay about the same price to go over to the rainforest or any other excursion that is offered. We went the first day to the grocery store and got some snacks and water for the week and we were able to drive over to the rainforest and go out to local areas at our leisure which helps to keep food costs down. Overall it was a great trip very relaxing and the hotel staff was very curteous and friendly going out of there was to greet you or to see if everything was to your liking.

The restaurants are all top quality, although a bit pricey. They do nickel and dime you on fees (ie daily parking fee, resort fee, housekeeping fee), but if you get an offseason or mid week room rate you still get terrific value. There is an airport shuttle, and day tours available, but it helps to have a car to get out and explore the island. I liked the proximity to smaller towns outside of the traffic and congestion of San Juan. There are less expensive dining options in nearby Luquillo and Fajardo, and you must visit the famous kiosks near the Luquillo Beach exit (only 10 minutes away) for inexpensive home cooked foods. It may look a little intimidating to the nervous traveler hoping to eat at a gleaming US eatery, but I found them friendly, inviting and very casual. If you are travelling with children, you will want to visit the famous Luquillo beach . For the $3 parking fee, there are restrooms , shady picnic areas, and one of the best beaches on the island. If you are single, you can venture to the same beach by parking behind the kiosks for free, then walk 30 yards over to the kiosks for a cold beer and snacks when you need them.

It was beautiful. -Just a comment on Puerto Rican culture, in relation to friendliness of staff: They will treat you with as much respect as you give them. I have been to many hotels in Puerto Rico and have found that wherever you go, you get the respect you give out. Don't expect to be treated nice if you yourself have an attitude. They don't play by the same rules as in other countries. We had a great time and were treated very nicely throughout the hotel grounds.' -If you are a tennis buff, this is a great place.

We were there from 10/6-10/11. The special occasion was our 4th anniversary. We are Wyndham vacation owners and we stayed at the Rio Mar Grande Resort and Spa. The hotel was really nice. The rooms were clean, maybe no 5 star prepared, but okay. The staff was helpful and they were very attentive. However, the guest census was low that might have been why. The water was nothing but gorgeous and we spent a great amount of our time at the pool and beach. There is a quiet pool too which was nice especially if you want to get away from the kids. The casino just opened and it was fun to play with! The hotel is about 35-40 minutes from the airport. If you need to go places like dinner or shopping, you definitely have to take a cab or rent a car. The city is relatively safe and easy to drive in. San Juan is a little crowded and congested, but it is tolerable. I have read some of the previous reviews and would like to just add a few recommendations. First, we rented a car from Payless car rental and paid about $90 for the entire week opposed to Avis and Budget who quoted $200/week. Rent at the airport and not the hotel, it is much cheaper. There is an Avis counter at the hotel, but to rent it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like $60 + a day. To catch a cab it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like $60 + too. Second, the food at the hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that impressive not including the high cost. The breakfast buffet was not good at all and not worth $25. The service can be somewhat slow too. Some of the onsite restaurants were closed and the ones that were open were over priced. I suggest that after you have rented a car to drive out every evening and experience the true authentic Puerto Rican and Caribbean cuisines. It is much cheaper and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different (go to La Parilla, Don Pepe, Antiogios). The hotel can give you an entire list. If you get tired of Puerto Rican foods you can always go to the American favorites-Chili, Outback, Macaroni Grill, Ruby Tuesday, etc. All of these places are in San Juan about 35 minutes away. Third, have toll money. It is $1.50 each way. Fourth, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take that high price San Juan tour bus because it will cost about $50/adult and $35/child. The tour just drops you off in Old San Juan where all of the shopping is. You can easily drive yourself and park in one of the parking decks, because you will never find a place to park on the street. I highly recommend going to the Belz Outlet stores, Old San Juan, and Plaza de Americanos (the largest mall in the Caribbean).Fourth, go on the Wyndham tour and presentation and get your free couples massage. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really pressure you to by anything. The massage was very refreshing, we loved it. Being a timeshare owner is a good investment if you vacate alot, but do not buy a timeshare directly from the company, i.e. Wyndham. You can definitely save 8-10K going through a third party company...thats what we did. Some of that extra money is going into that guy who is trying to sell you the property. Most of it is being vested back into the company for marketing and promotions to lure other potential byers into it. The concept is favorable, but not directly through the company. Next, before you go, confirm your reservations, especially if you booked it through a third party. I called a week ahead and they did not have my reservations put through yet. The hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have many king beds rooms, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get your hopes up for one especially if you are on a romantic getaway. They are nice about letting you change rooms when one comes available, but after you have unpacked and everything you really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to move anywhere. We had a mountain view (this is nothing but the top of the roof) at first then we moved into an ocean front after the second day. It still had two queen beds, but that was okay. Sometimes being a Wyndham By Request member grants you upgrade, but not all the time. The only thing that we benefited from this was early/late check in/out (depends on the census) and some free hard cookies and water in the room the first night. Next, valet is $20/day and self parking is $ 15/day so take your choice. I did valet, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really mean that I will do it again. Internet is not free. It is about $20 + a night and it cuts off at midnight. You can get free internet in the lobby, right in front of the front desk. My broadband card did not have good coverage at all in the room. Anyway, Puerto Rico is definitely a place that I will return to and will without question stay at the Rio Mar. There is really not a l. You have to ride out to go shopping and eating. If you are looking to stay somewhere that has a great night life then you need to stay in San Juan. There is really nothing in Rio Grande except the resort. Oh and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry yourself about leaving important items at home. There are plenty of Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around, not to mention Wal-Mart and K-Mart. I would go back again because it is very quiet, but we went in October so that could make a difference.

This is just a very beautiful resort, with a gorgeous golf course. What didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I like? The Valet parking, first of all parking at this huge property should be complimentary, the grounds are huge enough to make this a valid argument, just because valet parking is only slightly more expensive than self parking, we opted for the Valet. The staff of the Valet parking is not very apt at their job. They drive your car less than 2 minutes and manage to mess with all the climate controls in this short trip, I mean everything from degrees to fan strength, direction, everything. This is just rude. If you need to adjust the seat or mirrors, this I can understand, you need to in order to drive, but keep your paws off the climate controls! Another peeve was the attitude of the life guard at the pool. He must have been bored to death or something. I actually saw him blowing his whistle at adults for going down the slide head first! The other less than perfect aspect of the hotel is their prices for everything else. You name it everything is extremely overpriced. We did not eat or buy one single item at the hotel. Oh yes, and apparently we booked the room with the panoramic view of the rooftop. See picture. We did not venture out on our 'private balcony' the noise from the exhaust (see picture) was deafening.

David's cookies has sandwhiches. get it here instead of pay $12 at the bar/pool.

Also a bakery around corner from there. Doesn't look inviting, but resonable, editable food. Getting there: We took the hotel shuttle round trip for $60 p/p. Cab is $65 one way. However, I recomend you rent a car at least one day, probably the first, to see the rainforest, and get food supplies. Unfortuantely, it's $15 a day to park, unless renting onsite at avis. We paid $60 a day, but cheaper than a taxis to eat, and $40 p/p/ for rainforest tour. Make an advance car reg. before leaving, perhaps you can rent at airport and leave at hotel.

The drive to Ponce through the mountains was beautiful. But, the biggest disappointment of PR was the beaches.....not pretty like other places in the Carribean. The Rio Mar beach was the best we saw, but has alot of wave action. (Go down the beach to the east where the Rio Mar river empties into the ocean and you will have better luck beach combing). We were unable to dive because there were not enough tourists (low season) to make it feasible for the dive operators. Several places tried to get us on a dive boat (Thanks, Susie and Peter, at ECOTOURS). The Biobay tour was AWESOME and I am glad we went, (although my new husband said he was ready to divorce me because I didn't know my left from right when it came to paddling in a kayak!) But, being there during low season was great because we didn't have crowds to deal with. Weather was great, as well. So, we can say we have \"been there, done that\", in terms of PR.

Most days when we returned from the beach or other daytime activities (no earlier than 4:30 p.m. for 10 consecutive days) to prepare for the evening, the housekeeping staff had not made up our room and we were constrained to settle for fresh towels and toiletries.

The resort should provide transport into San Juan. It's a $60 cab ride into town, or rent a car. Do so at the airport for a more reasonable rate. Rio Mar should also update to either satellite TV or at least supply the usual premium cable stations...at no additional cost to guests. In the absence of transport, they should also provide movies and nightly entertainment instead of only on the weekends. And, only on the weekends means a combo playing in that beautiful lounge off the lobby for a coulpe of hours; Friday and Saturday nights only.

I would highly suggest to anyone that is going to plan lots of excursions because there is much to experience in Puerto Rico. The Rio Mar itself is a beautiful hotel with a great location between the beach and the Rain Forest. May I offer the following few humble tips/suggestions to make the most of your stay: 1. Rent a car from the airport as the overall cost of renting one will be much cheaper than paying the taxis/shuttles to and from the hotel. Also park in the employee parking lot next to the underground self-parking as it will save you the $15-20 a day the hotel tries to charge for parking. No one ever bothered us when we parked there as hotel/convention guests park there as well, and it is simply a few extra steps from the parking garage. 2. Know before you go that, as with all resorts, food and drinks will be very expensive at the hotel. Realize it is a vacation and that is just the way it goes. If you want to save some money, request a mini-fridge for your room and stock up on a few snacks/drinks at the nearby grocery store/Walgreens on Route 3 near the hotel. Also, feel free to drive down the street and eat at Antojitos which is cheaper and has great local food. 3. When you check in, note that the hotel only has 20% of rooms with king beds. Also, make sure you explore all your options for rooms. We got put in a corner room with two small windows without a balcony in order to get a king bed. After I very humbly and politely went back down to talk to the front desk, they moved us to a better Ocean Front room with a balcony overlooking the garden and Quiet Pool which was beautiful (two twin beds though, but overall a ten times better room). 4. Request the highest floor room you can get and try to get a view near the Adult/Quiet Pool. 5. For families, the kids seemed to love the kid/activity pool. As my wife and I went to relax without kids, we were quiet happy with the seperate adult/quiet pool which was very relaxing and quiet. Also, it seemed like you could always find available chairs pretty much anytime of the day. 6. When reserving your hotel, try booking directly through the hotel (Wyndham by request) as opposed to a travel site. While we got a fairly good deal (air/hotel/car rental) through orbitz, most of the people we talked to booked directly though Wyndham and received free breakfast buffets and other discounts on spa services/tours, etc. Keep in mind at $25 per person for the buffet, getting that thrown in is quiet a money saver! 7. The concierge at the Rio Mar are little help unless you want to go to a restaraunt onsite or take one of the hotel tours. We went to Old San Juan, snorkeling, and the Rain Forest on our own and had great times at all three excursions. Plus, the cost to us for going on our own was F-R-E-E! Plus, from some other folks we talked to, the hotel pretty much charges a $50 per person mark up on all tours - once again, if you rent a car you will come out on top. 8. On your way out to the pool/beach for the day, stop by the fitness center as you can grab free water bottles there. If you grab the ones from your room, you will get charged like $4 for each bottle! In conclusion, the hotel is a beautiful place to relax and enjoy the pool, beach, and ocean, and the great location. The only downside is the high cost for everything, but if you just know that going in and plan accordingly to how much you might want to spend, or take some of the tips noted above, you will have a great time!", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota City, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel - Nothing To Do\u201d", "Author": "akn64", "ReviewID": "UR8434603", "Content": "Beautiful hotel.

The employees were all friendly and helpful and very accomodating (although the only \"issue\" we had was that we waited quite a while for check in as we arrived around 1 pm and was told our room was not ready and each time we called to check they said it was too soon and when pressed for a time it was first 4, 4:30 and then 5 and stated that all times are approximate).

But, I also will say that all of the meals were very good. We tried a variety of the restaurants and I can say we were not disappointed with the quality of the food. And, I will say that all of the servers were excellent!! The real downside that we found was that there was really nothing for our 17 yr old to do. Thank goodness he brought his laptop to use each evening in the lobby - it saved our sanity. Additionally, even though our 12 yr old was pretty much tired every evening after playing in the ocean (truly beautiful) all day - there was not a lot for her either other than the water slide and hair braiding. The \"dive-in\" movie on Friday and Saturday was great and you may want to consider offering that on more evenings as it is helpful with the younger ones!!

Contrary to the reviews early on, since the Wyndam has taken over perhaps, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The people behind the desk (Jessica) and the concierge were great help and there was absolutely no problem with the bill. It was easy to check in and check out. The drinks at the pool were great. We recommend the ziggy zaggy drink. They were a bit pricey but like any resort they were about ten bucks for a 8 oz cup. Its about right but they were great. I would advise you to rent a car. Rent a car at the airport if you are smart since the cabs out to Rio Grande are 65 dollars to begin with and the hotel offers a shuttle but charge per person. Plus, the restaurants on site are incredibly pricey and quite ridiculous as they do not offer a midrange restuarant for the average joe. We chose to rent a car and drove down the road to Antojitos Restaurant whih has moderately priced meals and were fantastic. Plus, Fajarado is about ten minutes away and there are a ton of restaurants down there.

The first thing and this may come off in a weird way but you never feel as though the hotel is giving you anything. You pay all this money for a resort and you would think, you may get a free drink or some attention from the staff, perhaps some organized fun perhaps but there is nothing. Once you check in and give your credit card, there is this feeling of you against the hotel financially. There are drinks that cost a fortune and they charge you for everything. For example, I had complimentary golf tickets from the American Cancer Society and the course was gorgeous. Really nice. But, they charged the two of us $110 for club rentals and refused to take it off our bill. Now, thats understandable but lets get real as this was something we got for charity. It's little things like that including the 15 dollars for parking, the 4 dollars for a muffins or even using the expensive spa, there is not this sense that the resort will grant anything to you. Maybe I am asking too much but they charge for everything. There is one place called Davids cookies for breakfast which is decent as its somewhat cheaper and quick but the line is about a half hour. That is frustrating. Overall, we are a patient couple who enjoyed the trip overall. the resort is gorgeous and to sit by the pool is great. We actually bought a twelve pack of beer at a local supermarket and some wine and brought it out to the pool and had an amazing time.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort!

We stayed for 3 nights (7/29 - 8/1) at the Wyndham (formally Westin) Rio Mar. First off, I would really recommend renting a car if you're going to stay here. As others have mentioned, it's about an hour from SJU airport depending on how many signals you hit along the way. (Take the Hwy 66 toll road to cut about 20 min off your trip.) Taxis can be very spendy and in order to see anything outside the resort, you'll need to have a car - unless you're ok paying the marked up rates the hotel charges for their tours of Old San Juan, El Yunque Rain Forest, etc. As for the hotel itself, the grounds were absolutely beautiful. Upon entering, you're taken away from the drab city of Rio Grande and transported into an oasis. After passing the guard house, drive slowly down road (to make sure you don't run over any iguanas!) We chose to self-park for $15/day instead of paying the $25/day for valet. I think self-park was actually quicker than valet as there was constantly a line at least 4 to 5 deep of people waiting for their cars. Upon checking in, we were given a room with 2 beds (even though we requested a king bed). We told the manager and he quickly hooked us up with the correct room (and said it was our lucky day). According to him, only 20% of the rooms at the resort have king beds\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so if you really want one, it might be best to call ahead and confirm. If you want a quiet room, pay less and go for the rooms with the rain forest/resort view (like we did). The ocean view rooms are above the pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which can be noisy until late in the night. Aside from the bagels and cookies from the bakery, we only dined once in the hotel at Marbella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It was on the expensive side, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be expected in any resort. The food was decent, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to screw up a club sandwich. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for great (authentic) Puerto Rican food, just drive down the hill to Antojitos Puertorrique\u00c3\u00b1os. Our best meal in P.R. was at this place. Try the tostones stuffed with crab. They were awesome! The hotel was just recently purchased by Wyndham, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning any remodeling besides the casino (which was temporarily closed). The only real flaw we spotted was the worn out carpet in the hallways. Lots of stains. Also, as others have mentioned, the walls are pretty thin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so you can hear the TV and people next door, as well as the constant running/yelling/crying of children in the hallway. Our neighbor checked in at 3am and promptly woke us up by trying to open the door that connected our two rooms. Not sure why, but seriously\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6have you never been in a hotel room before??? Other than that, our room was perfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spacious, well appointed, and clean. When we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the room, we were at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quiet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which if you get down there early is just that. Get there before 8am and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll likely have the whole pool to yourself. Later in the day, it can get a bit crowded. A previous reviewer found the pool to be not so clean. We found the contrary during our stay. We saw the crew out there cleaning every morning and constantly washing/sweeping the pool deck during the day (as iguanas would tend to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leave their mark\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd).

The price of the room was deceptive, with all of the added mandatory charges (for the conference rate they add on charges for bellman (which we did not use), and maid gratuity and resort charges.

It's also a loud hotel and the room walls are paper thin. Lots of loud partying going on in other rooms and at the pools. I hate to say this but many of the hotel guests seemed sleazy. The Ugly: management at this hotel is nonexistant. We were initially given a room with one bed when we had requested two doubles.

They never came, even after 7 more calls down to the front desk, and even after another couple showed up at our room saying the room we were in had been given to them.

The resort is approximately an hour's drive from Old San Juan (taxi cost $70 without tip), a journey that offers views of everything from KFC to the mountains. Rio Mar is a few miles off the highway, and the resort itself (including the clubhouse and golf course) is so large that you \"need\" to board a shuttle to get to the more distant spots. The inside of the hotel is stunning: beautiful/spacious lobby, breathtaking views and well-appointed decor. Check-in was relatively easy, though I noticed at least 10 employees standing behind the row of desks and only one actively working with guests. (This was true of check-out, too, and I recommend checking out from your room by phone. You can leave your name and room number on a machine, and they check you out. The final bill is left under your door on the morning of your departure.) The room we had overlooked a lagoon-ish area with about 20 iguanas, lots of fish and a few turtles. I'd not wanted to pay extra for the ocean view, and I have to say that this vista was fabulous. We sat on the balcony each morning/evening and enjoyed watching those prehistoric creatures. (One small annoyance: other guests on balconies felt it was appropriate to throw food down to the iguanas all day.) I loved our room; every bit about it felt perfect. They did a fabulous job with the interior. There are, officially, two pools, but they are so close together that it seems like one large one. Though the pools look unbelievable in the hotel's photos, you should know that it is a maximum of 4 feet in places - and usually 3.5. Also, while the hotel was not terribly crowded when we were there, I imagine there would be significant congestion in the pools in the winter months. The beach is close to perfection: good waves (neither too big nor too small), attentive waiters, fine sand, lots of space, excellent temperature. I recommend taking a walk to the right, which can take you quite far away from the hotel if you'd like. Every entry I'd read on tripadvisor before I left emphasized the priciness of the food. I was still willing to go b/c we'd gotten the room for $120/night (before the nightly $30 resort fee - their way of pretending the hotel doesn't cost $150/night). Unfortunately, the food is NOT anything above average; for the price, it is definitely sub-par. We ate at the Italian restaurant and the main restaurant, and we would not have ordered our dishes a second time. I would not have grumbled if the food had been excellent, but to pay $30 for one dinner plate and then taste something bland...well, it made me cranky. We did not eat at the seafood restaurant or the clubhouse, and the asian steakhouse was closed. (Note: the casino is also closed right now, but the resort offers a complimentary shuttle to another resort, the Gran Melia, very frequently.) Some price examples in the gift shop: $2.85 for a 1 liter bottle of soda, $1.50 for a can of soda, $3.75 for the weekday New York Times, $2.00 for a candy bar. There is a coffee shop/bakery that serves excellent treats (and stays open late) where the prices are a bit more palatable ($7 sandwiches), but there are still some items that will make your head spin (cereal is close to $4 from what I remember - and more if you add fruit). The hotel website and in-house materials mentions a \"nominal fee\" for transportation to San Juan airport; this fee turns out to be $35/person. If you are not by yourself, a taxi is probably the better way to go. (After all, the cost for a family - despite the claim to nominality - would be exorbitant.) We were content to sit by the pool/beach and decided not to do much by way of sightseeing, but for those eager to get out and see more of the island, Rio Mar is quite isolated. You would certainly need a taxi ride to get to the nearest grocery store, and there is no \"town\" area nearby: just a stretch of highway that looks like the ugly parts of NJ (with much nicer views). Overall, the Rio Mar was a beautiful place to be for a few days.

You can drive into Old San Juan and San Juan and eat at some wonderful restaurants, or some of the smaller restaurants that are in Rio Grande. You can also save money by eating a muffin, or bagel at the cafe rather than the $23/person buffet for breakfast.

I was part of a larger group. It was my husband's family reunion. There were 23 of us in total including children, two of which were under 2 years old. We all rented three of the 3-bedroom golf villas. I read many of the reviews on this site and because I got to see three different villas I do understand why there are different opinions. Of the three villas our group rented, one was fabulous (luckily, this was the one I was in), one was very nice, and one was not nice. I understand that each is owned privately so each is decorated and cared for differently. However, these were not cheap and the one villa was unacceptable for the price we paid. That one was Villa Naranja. It really needs to be nicer. It was practically bare and there were light bulbs without any fixtures. Just bare light bulbs. Not worth the price. However, Villa Chaly and Villa Rio were fantastic. Villa Rio was the best. If you go try to request it. I rented the villas through The Clusters.com. They were great. Totally helpful. Especially Xavier. He's awesome. Ok, now for the resort. It was very nice though we didn't spend a whole lot of time inside the main building. There was a bunch of construction going on past the main building. I guess just past where the ocean villas were. It was unattractive but the only reason we drove by it was because we drove past the main building by accident. You can't see it from the pool or beach as far as I know. Maybe from the Ocean VIllas though. We ate in the casual restaurant one night and were pleased. But I have to say I don't think Puerto Rican food is all that great to begin with so I wasn't expecting much. The golf villas are quite a ways away from the resort pool and beach. But each villa had use of a golf cart which made it fine. Especially for the kids. They loved the carts. We even found a free place to park a car (near the playground at the pool). The beach was nice though we spent most of our time at the pool. It was pretty windy most of the time we were there so they wouldn't allow umbrellas on the beach and we needed them for the babies. The food and drinks at the pool are ridiculously expensive. Bring a small cooler and bring your own. So that's it. Would I go back? Only if we did another family reunion there - my husband's family is Puerto Rican. Though this has nothing to do with the resort. I just think there are much nicer places than Puerto Rico.

It was a very easy ride using the toll road and only took about 30 minutes. Once we arrived the front desk up-graded us from a Resort View room to a Jr. Ocean View Suite. It was very nice and in a great location at the end of the hall. Beautiful sunrise while drinking coffee on the lani and picture perfect sunsets each evening. When we vacation I need golf and my wife needs a beach/pool. The resort has two pools; one of them is considered a \"quiet\" pool and is designed for adults only. That wasn't always the case during our many hours poolside but it still was very relaxing. The beach is just beyond the pools and although it was windy and waves were cranking... it was also very pleasant. The staff will help you with your lounge chairs, umbrellas and towels. Wait staff is there for your drink and food needs. Definitely rent the jet skis and have a fun 30 minutes on the open ocean!

Only go if you are OK with paying $40 for a steak. A few nights we went off site just to check out the area. Las Vegas was probably the best local restaurant we experience. As for the golf, I played the Greg Norman River Course. A wonderful lay-out that requires you to be accurate off the tee. If you find the fairway on your tee shot then you can score well.

Vegetarians beware, throughout our stay we had a tough time finding food options, in the hotel as well as outside. There aren't many restaurants nearby - so the only one we tried was Don Pepe on Rte 3. Its very close to the hotel, and had authentic Puerto Rican food. Loved the Malfungo (mashed plaintains). Stay here if you want to be close to beaches, water sports & activities. Its close to Fajardo which is where most of the island adventure trips such as snorkelling, scuba, kayaking etc are located. Also steps away from El Yunque which is a must see to get a flavor for a rainforest. We booked ourselves on East Island Adventures for snorkelling in Culebra, Eco Action Tours for Kayaking (Bio Bay). Both were good. There are several options and most are priced pretty much the same. I think the hotel charges a lot more than if you book directly with the tour company. The hotel has a great dive center, and rents out all kinds of equipments including water bikes. Towels & umbrellas on the beach are complimentary. Self Parking is $15 & Valet is $25 a day.

We were able to stop along the way at Walgreens to stock up on sunscreen and some other items we couldn't pack due to the restrictions.

We ate at the golf course's steakhouse the first night, which was really expensive, but did have good food. The food and drink prices are a bit higher than typical for a resort. We also at ate Marbella one night and at the casual out door restaurant for lunch. We took the shuttle that comes to the resort to the Bamboo Lounge one evening. That was a fun dinner. I wouldn't have wanted to drive there myself. Great view, okay food. I tried the mofongo. We also went to Don Pepe's which is just a short way from the hotel. It was pretty good and we liked seeing the dogs living on the roof next door. We drove to the ferry station at Fajardo and parked the car overnight while we spent two days in Vieques. That island was truly the highlight of the trip. It was absolutely beautiul and the bio-bay was amazing. I wish we would've spent more time there. Not to be missed!! We also went to El Yunque with our car-definitely skip the visitor center. The hotel will give the same map. We hiked to the waterfall, which was pretty.

They know that you're 1 hour from San Juan and 30 minutes from other restaurants, so the prices are very high. The most disappointing part of our stay was the golf. We saved up and had our one big splurge on a round of golf at the Ocean Course (there is also a River Course, but there was a tournament going on when we were there). First of all, there is only one par 3 hole that is on the ocean - and it's surrounded by construction as they are building new condos all around it. The other 17 holes are no where near the ocean. And they didn't even tell us that they were seeding all of the greens, so we paid $150 per person for \"green\" fees even though the greens were perfectly brown and sandy with seed. It was very disappointing. Though the course may have been special back in the '80s when Greg Norman designed it, it is very run down and is not worth such a high green fee.

The restaurants, bars and spa on site are pricey, but you can save lots of money on the tours by renting a car! The rainforest (El Yunique) is a free tour but the hotel charges $38 per person to take you there. El Yunique is directely up the \"long mountain road\" from the hotel. The hotel also offers a tour to Old San Juan which is $45 per person but they dont take you to the El Morro fort, it only goes to the forts by the shopping area. If you rent a car you can go throughout the entire tourist area and just pay for parking (much cheaper). Also, there's a great outlet mall about 20 minutes away from the hotel. The conceirge is very helpful with maps and directions so if you decide to rent a car - getting around shouldnt be a problem. I suggest you rent from the Avis car rental located at the resort because they'll give you free parking, otherwise parking is $15 a day for outside rentals. Also there's 2 really good spanish restaurants at the corner of highway #3 where the resort entrance is (Don Pepe & Antoniette's) their prices are way cheaper than anything in the resort. Also there's KFC's, Burger King's and other fast food places you can get to (if you have a car).Be sure to keep all your receipts charged to your room and review your bill before paying room charges. If your traveling with kids - the hotel feeds the iguanna's at 11am everyday for free - join in! The kids club is a bit a rip off, unless u really need a babysitter. Find a local liquor store and add alcohol to ur drinks at the beach. The spa was ok - but I've had better for cheaper.

We called Rio Mar, and through a series of calls to Jose at the front desk we were lead to the hotel. Jose took each call personally and was a life saver.

We found the resort, pools and beaches to be clean and not too crowded. We really didn't have a problem finding chairs at the pool or beach. Rooms have been recently updated and were comfortable. Everyone who worked at Rio Mar was friendly and very helpful, from front desk staff to maids to room service. Carlos at the concierge was great with arranging our snorkeling trip, providing recommendations to local restaurants, and directions. Recommendations: Rent a car - it's less expensive than the shuttle (we had a family of 4 with \"tween age kids\") and you can go where you want when you want. Take a trip to WalMart or Amigos to stock up on bottled water/snacks/drinks. Go to El Yunque. We skipped the overpriced tour and went to the visitor's center and drove through the park stopping at the things we wanted to do and see. We did book a snorkeling day trip on a catamaran that went to a reef and then to Flamenco Beach on Culebra - it was one of the highlights of the trip! Eat at the local restaurants. The hotel restaurants are good enough as was room service, but we really enjoyed trying the local cuisine in the nearby restaurants. Take part in the iguana feeding at the Rio Mar - fun for all ages. Try to speak Spanish (even though it seems almost everyone in P.R. also speaks English) and ask lots of questions - everyone we met was so friendly and enjoyed telling us about Puerto Rico. What we'll do next time: might try to stay on Vieques or the caribbean side of the island - white sand, calmer water. We will try to visit Old San Juan and maybe take the Bacardi tour.

Our check-in was a breeze, though the fron't desk wasn't the most pleasant but they got better througout our stay. Our rooms were on the 6th floor, right next to each other which was what we requested and we could see the water from our room. We ate dinner 2 nights and breakfast one morning on the grounds and thought that it was much more reasonable than I expected. For dinner, we ate at Marbella and had a turkey burger with all the fixins for $13.00. Breakfast was $10 for eggs, toast, bacon and home fries. The buffet was $23. In addition, the waitstaff was EXCELLENT! We had the same waiter (Waldy) each night and he was very accomodating to whatever we needed. The resort is HUGE and it can be a little confusing getting around (I got lost in the hallway trying to get back to my room from the car!) but they have many convenient features: a coffee shop that sells breakfast breads, coffee, ice cream and David's Cookies; stores and carts within the resort; live music in the lobby bar every night. The beach was not very crowded and we had no problem getting assistance from the staff is setting up chairs and umbrellas for us. The pool was very nice - they have a \"quiet pool\" for those who don't want kids doing cannonballs in the water while you are reading - a nice feature. We went to the rainforest, which is a must since it is literally across the highway from the resort! It was very nice.

The pool was also very nice with a small slide and a volleyball net for the kids and kids at heart. The golf course also looked very inviting although we didnt play. The entire staff at the hotel were friendly - we never experienced any rudeness as some of the reviewers mentioned. Each time we asked for suggestions on local eateries they were always very helpful. We found that almost EVERYONE spoke english to the point where it was a bit disappointing because we wanted to feel like we were very far away from home. The Food at the Grille Restaurant in the hotel was our favorite - Best Prime RIb Ever and we are from New York which makes us big critics when it comes to food and service. If you are from a large city in the US like we are, prices will be more or less the same at all the restaurants. We thought all the restaurants in the hotel were very good. But renting a car is a must so you can go to the local eatieries and get a taste of real Puerto Rican Fare at inexpensive prices. The Yunque Rain Forest trip is a must do and it will give you a sense of accomplishment after hiking a mile up or down to the waterfalls and help rid some of the guilt from the thousands of calories that you have taken in so far with the Pina Coladas and Puerto Rican empanadas. The casino is closed until October and there wasnt any nightlife except the lobby bar which had live music. Dont bother going to the casino that they shuttle you to. Take a drive to El San Juan Hotel in San Juan..it is well worth the trip. The drive is about 30 minutes on rt 66 to 26 and it is a great place to go for gambling, lounging and dancing...all right in the lobby! It was action packed and a great place to visit and win some money but we were glad to return to our hotel at 430 am to serenity and relaxation. I dont recommend this resort for kids unless you plan on spending every waking moment with them! We chose not to take our kids and that was the best decision. I would recommend the Club Med in Punta Cana for that which have many more organized activities. But if you want a relaxing vacation with your significant other and enjoy a resort with all the comfort that you need, the Rio Mar is a great place to visit. My only complaint is that the drive to the resort when you enter the compound is a bit confusing. They have two signs, one that says turn left to the country club/condos and one that tells you to turn left to the resort when you should actually drive straight forward.

Food is expected to be high because you can either rent a car, use the hotel shuttle with a tour ($55/pp) or taxi ($45). We opted to rent a car for 2 days and it was well worth it, highly recommend. It's impossible to get lost, the major road is Route 3 and all the resturants, shops and grocery stores run on it. The rain forest is directly across the intersection leading into the Rio Mar..a MUST do! The hike is about a mile from parking to the rainfall, and it is beautiful. Also the Barcardi Factory tour is great to do, it is $55 per person for transportation, admission is free. Almost half of the things to do in PR is free, it's transportation to worry about if you don't rent a car.

Just to give you an idea on prices: $10 for a smallish mojito, pina coladas, etc & $6 for a can of beer, breafast buffet was about $30 per person; tuna salad wrap with tortillas chips at the pool restaurant was $13. I didn't even try to eat dinner at the hotel restaurants because the menus seemed so pricey ( between $25-$35 per entree). I think that's just too expensive even if you are on vacation. 2-you need a car or get a taxi if you want to eat a mid priced meal. We ate at a restaurant called Antojitos that was moderately priced and had good puerto rican food. It's at the end of the road just before rt 3. I was disappointed that there wasn't alot of puerto rican food served at the hotel during the day. I ate alot of american food. 3-you need to look at your bill carefully when you check out. I was charged a bellman's fee of $14 though I had never used any of the bellman's services. And a mini bar charge appeared on my bill and i han't had anything from it. overall the rio mar was just ok. from what i hear, if you want to stay in this part of the island, the rio mar is the best you can do. don't forget to rent a car.

Great pool, great beach. Good service pretty much everywhere at the hotel with only small issues here and there. Biggest drawback was the closed casino. The hotel will shuttle you to the nearby Gran Meila (15 to 20 minutes) but we're talking small \"kill some time\" casinos, not Las Vegas destinations, so even though I did this a couple of nights, it wasn't worth it. Especially not a good idea when the shuttle bus is full getting back to the Wyndham and I had to wait an hour for the next one. Just plan on skipping the casino experience (which was a big drawback because this was a factor in selecting this hotel in March and I never got any notice that it would close the day we arrived). As I write this review and rate this hotel, I have to look past this factor because it made me very angry. When we first arrived, food prices blew us away, but food anywhere in PR isn't really cheap. When you figure in the convenience and extra safety factor, I would say this goes with the territory. Reasonably priced kids menu, but it's limited. That said, we didn't eat or drink ($10 a drink) at the hotel much as a result. We got a small fridge for our room and bought some drinks to keep around. Hard to figure that this was something they would do, but I have to not knock them for high drink prices if they make it easier to have my own. Strange business practice, but works for families. Staff was very nice to us almost all the time. Front desk and Concierge were pretty busy most of the time and didn't move quickly, but that was a result of staff working to take care of each person. They had printed directions to almost everything ready to hand out--very helpful. Valet parking was a little slow at peak times, but that should be expected. We learned to call ahead and they always had it ready to go. This was the nicest (most expensive) resort in which we have ever stayed, so we weren't the big tippers. We focused on being nice to the staff, even when we were tired, and tipping modestly. We were treated well in return. In terms of places to eat, we are apparently just too darn Americanized. Our favorite family places were Wing Hut (next to Pep Boys and North of Hwy 3 at the same turn where Walmart is to the south). Go figure, the standard Hibachi Grill which did a great job and entertained too; Don Pepe: combo mexican and local dishes just west of the turn on Hwy 3 into the resort and Antojitos, a local food menu right on the road from Hwy 3 to the resort. We also stopped quite a few times at the bakery on Hwy 3 which we found to be good food and excellent baked goods and sandwiches. Service was difficult and not well organized, but we still enjoyed it and met one of the owners who was a very nice lady. We organized most of our own off-resort activites to save a little money or tailor it to our needs. You do save money, but you also have a little more stress. All of our activities went well, but don't hesitate to ask for referrals, you'll probably get a good one and that's more reliable than a web site. Other than the casino, we didn't really have anything to complain about and the hotel was full during our stay including some business groups and graduations. Occasionally you might have to wait a little, but if you can check your attitude and recognize when you are tired, you will realize that most of the people there want to help you enjoy your stay. Frankly, I think most of the negative posts on this site are by people you couldn't make happy in a million years. They want a $500 room for $100 and everything to revolve around them. Just know you're going to have to pay up to stay here even if you get a good room rate--this is a great resort and its staff and owners deserve to make a living. All things considered, this was a great resort we could enjoy year after year.

The wait staff could not have been friendlier, they went our of their was to help you, but later on I found out why. Almost everything at the Resort has a fee attached to it. The fees add up every quickly. Keep an eye on your biill because they have no issues in helping you out in some way and then charging your room. If someone asks your room number, you will be charged. I would not have been able to afford this trip, but my wife's company sent a group of us there as a \"thank you\". Very nice of them I might add... The grounds are 25 miles from the airport, we had the hotel shuttle pick us up. I have no idea of the cost to have this done, but it is not free. The driver was nice enough to stop at the store at the top of the street so we could all get bottles of liquor & mixers for our rooms because I had read reviews that said mix drinks were $10, well it's true. If you are going to be sitting by the pool or on the beach all day and you don't want to ring up $200 a day tabs for just drinks, hit the store.The hotel charges $120 for the same bottle of Grey Goose you can get for $19 at the store. When we got to the hotel, we were early, I was not expecting to get in to a room. Half of our group were able to get in to their rooms right away, the rest of us hit the Tiki Bar (more on the Tiki Bar later). Because our room was not ready, the desk comped us $40 to use any way we wanted. I thought that was very nice of them because they did not need to give us anything since we were three hours early. The room was nice. Great view of the mountains. Two larger than full size beds, nice clean bathroom, wet bar with a small fridge, TV, tile floor with a rug around the bed area, safe in the closet, small deck with table and chairs. The standard hotel room+. Ocean view would have been nice but I would have dreaded a room anywhere near the pools with all the activities going on during the day. The lobby is on the third floor, so when we stayed on the sixth floor we were only three floors from the roof, and the A/C units. It made sitting on the deck a little loud, but I live in the city, I'm used to hearing a/c cranking when I'm on roof decks. The food was ok. Prices ranged from a $3.50 ham & cheese croissant from David's Cookies (really a coffee shop) to $120 Surf & Turf. We ate at most of the restaurants at the hotel and they were all ok. Nothing was significantly outstanding, just ok. The prices they charged were expensive for the quality of the food received. The best meal we had was at the Asian/Sushi restaurant. Never expected to find good sushi in Puerto Rico! Most of the time we ate at the Tiki Bar. They had a limited menu of burgers and chicken sandwiches. Not bad, at busy times you could wait about 20 mins for your food. The Tiki bar is a small beach front bar with live music somedays. It's right in the middle of the action so you wont miss much. The view was great! Some info you might need: The Tiki Bar does NOT take cash, only room charges. I saw many people get upset with this, I think they were over reacting my self. All the other bars and restaurants do take cash. Just another note, when you order a beer, the cans are all 10oz!!!!! They charge you $6 for this little beer too. If you go to the lobby bar, and ask for a bottle you can get a real 12oz beer for the same price. Overall the hotel was nice, but expensive.

I pulled the suitcases from the car and watched as my daughter (9 years old) struggled to carry her bag up the steps while 3 bellhops watched her and continued their conversation. We arrived to check in to find our rooms were not ready. We were told to change into bathing suits in the bathrooms next to the check-in desk. We went to the pool to find it had film floating on top of the water and vomit. When we were allowed into the room, it was nice. The next day we enjoyed some of the facilities. At 4pm, we returned to the room to find that it was still not made up. We called to have it prepared and an hour later someone came up. The pool still had the same issues as before even after several people complained. The next day we used the cabana, since it was included in the package. Someone dropped off the sodas and water in the morning and we never saw him again. The pool still had the mysterious film. We had lunch at a beachside bar. It took 1 hour to bring a $13.50 chicken salad sandwich. Later that day, we went to the room to find it was not ready at 5pm and when I called, the operator asked, \"what do you want me to do?\" Then they cleaned the room and did not bring toiletries. I called again but no one dropped of the shampoo. I had to drive to a store to get shampoo. To get the car out of the valet was an experience. It took on average 15-30 minutes to get the car and the valet gave me a dirty look as I handed him the key. The next day we complained to the manager who did try to help. She agreed the service was so bad, the offered us 20000 starwood points and wipe out all room charges. We left. While leaving, the bell staff made sure the service was good.

Let me put everyones minds at ease that this is the most fabulous resort with exceptional service in paradise. When we arrived at the resort we were greeted by two smiling bellmen who helped us with our luggage. Check-in was a breeze 10 minutes at the most. We requested our room to be on the 6th or 7th flloor overlooking the El YunQue rainforest. If you do get a resortview instead of oceanview which I recomend it will save you money and actually it is more impressive than the ocean view, stay on the 6 or 7th floor. Our room was in pristine condtion with two Heavenly beds, terracotta tile floors, the room has a blow-dryer in it that is better than the one I have at home, a safe was in our room as well, along with toiletries from Bath and Body Works, bottled water was given to us daily (San Pelligrino) there was supposed to be a charge for this type of bottled water but our maid gave it to us for free. The beaches here at the resort are to die for. Super clean and smooth sand with turquiose water that is never cold! And the three swimming pools (with one water slide) are amazing. We ate every moring at Marabell's the food was exceptional. They serve a breakfast buffet. The continental buffet was 16 dollars which consisted of muffins, donuts, bagels, lox, ham, cheese, fresh fruit(mangoes papaya, berries watermelon, melons) cereals yogur and granolas. The other buffet was eggs sausage bacon omlet bar (made to order) and everything else under the sun this was 23, our 6 yr old's meal was free and our 12yr old was 8dollars. I highly reccomend this buffet and what we did was keep our yogurt on ice and bananas for lunch because we are not big lunch eaters. I do not recommend getting your muffins and coffee at the David's coffee place located in the resort. We ended up paying 25 dollars for two juices, 3 muffins, and two coffees when at the buffet we paid apx 50 for all of us to eat and we were stuffed and we had food left over for lunch. For dinner we ate off of the resort at a place at thebottom of Rd968 and Rd 3 called Anojitos where we had a delicious, authentic Puerto Rican meal with excellent service. Ask for Monica to serve you. She's wonderful and very pleasant to speak with. She went out into the back and caught a Coqui frog for our children to see! Do not waste your money on shuttle and Taxi services on the island. Definately, definately rent a car....in the end it's far cheaper and you have access to the entire island.

I wish we had stayed here an extra night - this hotel is absolutely beautiful! Everything was well maintained and beautifully kept - the beach was very nice and the pool was not bad. The location was also very good, if you are more interested in nature and such. We drove here from the airport (very easy half-hour drive, take the new 66 highway and make sure you have quarters for the $1.50 toll) and were astounded at how large the property grounds are. It's very close to El Yunque rainforest so if you rent a car, you just drive across the street and go up the mountain into the rainforest. We did the Big Tree hike and saw La Mina waterfall. (bring a bathing suit, you can swim in the waterfall) For food, we ate off the hotel grounds. I highly, HIGHLY recommend Richie's (if you continue to go past the entrance of the Westin, it's up the hill on the right). A local restaurant that serves Puerto Rican food, I had my best meal here. If you get Manny, you are in for a treat - he was possibly the best waiter I've ever had! My boyfriend and I were amazed at how he anticipated everything we needed - he saw us scratching at ourselves b/c of the mosquitos (make sure you bring lots of bug spray) and offered us a can of Off! bug repellant before we even asked him. And the food was to die for - very flavorful and rich. It is on the pricier side but you will pay that much if you eat at the hotel anyway. We also got a couple's massage at Mandara Spa - I remember my masseuse's name (Carlos) and he was very good. Again, rather pricy but you are on vacation right? Overall, our stay at the Westin was great - everyone there treated us very kindly and was very quick to service us if we had any requests.

We had a room on the 6th floor with a great ocean view and a balcony overlooking the main back yard with views of the pools and beach areas. Anything lower and the palm trees may obscure your view a bit. We had 2 double beds which were ok although we would have preferred a king. Tile floors and the bathroom was nice sized. Overall it was clean and comfortable. We got a mini fridge to cut down on costs and they brought that up within 5 minutes of asking for it. We only ate at the resort once at Aqua Luna which was ok...not fantastic but good overall. Our best meals were ones we got offsite consisting of local food. The numbered kioks at Luquillo beach (about 5 minutes from the hotel) off of Route 3 on the left hand side (2 stoplights away) were great. We went 3 times. They all offer similar food but #58 had a whole spit roasted pig which was outstanding and the best pork we've ever had. Across from them was a little tent selling chicken & pork skewers for $2 each which were also good (chicken better). #60 had a great seafood rice dish chock full of seafood. We spent between $10-20 each time we went. You can pick up the food & walk about 30 steps to Luquillo beach which is directly behind the food kiosks. Another great find was Ismar's Bakery on the corner of Route 3 & where you turn into the Westin. Great Cuban & Pastrami sandwiches.

The front desk was pleasent and was offered the keys to my room. This is where the problem started..... When I walked into my room, it appeared as though someone got a haircut in the room. I'm not talking about a little bit of hair, I mean a lot of hair. Being that my wife and I are clean and neat freaks, I immediatly went to the front desk who said they would clean it up immediatly. They apologized for the mistake, and I took as just that, a mistake. About 30 minutes later, we went into the room again, I could tell someone had been through the room cleaning but, I still wasn't pleased with the room. So, I went to the front desk again, this time, I asked for a new room. I wasn't given any attitude, I was told that they were sold out and it would be hard to move me. I explained to the manager that I wasn't about to stay in the room due to what I experienced, the manager agreed and offered me a new room. Room 4029. The room itself was like any other hotel room. It had some wear and tear but over all, it was average. BEACH: I've read many reviews where people have enjoyed the beach. I personally, couldn't stand it. I was disapointed. The beach is quite (most of the action is at the pool). POOL: The pool area is nice. Getting chairs can be a pain, so be warned! The pool is very enjoyable (pool volleyball, pool games)!

A good place to catch some live music or enjoy a drink and listen to the waives crash! All in all the hotel is average. The grounds are very nice. I didn't enjoy my room experience.

We booked the hotel on points thru Starwood which was great. I used Trip Advisor hints extensively, so I wanted to report back on how it went. We rented a car from Avis at the airport for about $200 for the week which gave us flexiblitiy and savings. This was cheaper then using hotel transport which is $75 pp/each way. When we got to the hotel we used the open air \"staff\" parking across from the basement self park of the hotel. Again this saved us $10 a night for self park or $20 a night for valet park. When we arrived at the hotel at 2:30 our room was not ready, as we knew to expect from previous postings, so we had bathing suits and flip flops available, changed in the bathroom and hit the beach. By 4:00 we really wanted to check in, so got back on line. (this hotel does not have a starwood express line as it should) We were told our room still wasn't ready. When I pointed out that check in was supposed to be at 3, I was told that they have a \"window\" from 3 to 5. As I found this unacceptable, I announced that we would now wait at the lobby bar with complimentary drinks from them and that when the room was ready they could call us at the bar. The clerk said just one moment - went into the office for a minute- and came out announcing that our room was now ready. We asked for and received an upper floor with ocean view. The room was a little shabby, with cracked floor tiles and chipped tub, not as modern as the Westin in Cancun. But it was scrupulously clean and perfectly acceptable. Especially as it was free. The safe was still locked from previous guests, the refrigerator I had requested was not there, and the room key did not work. I stopped a passing security man, who apparently made a call for us and all was fixed within a half hour. We had stopped at Rodriquez' market on the corner of 3 as you turn to go on the road for the Westin as recommended on this site. This worked out well. We stocked up on soda, juice, chips, cookies and milk. This rounded out the hotel meals and meals out. In the room is a snack/drink frdge that is locked. We never unlocked it as I had read that the prices were ridiculous. There are 2 kinds of water in the room, large bottles with a private label from a local spring water company. These are free and I asked the maid to leave us extra each day which she did. I stored these in the fridge, and brought them down to the beach along with my insulated mug full of ice. This This worked out well. The bar refilled my mug with ice whenever I asked. Tere are also small bottles of water labelled \"Westin\" in the room. These are $3 each which you are not told. Most people were walking around with the Westin water - I think they wrongly thought that was the free one. There was a coffee maker with supplies (free) in the room as well as bathrobes. The hotel was full, and preferred seating at the pool and beach was hard to come by. There are two pools. Only the \"quiet\" pool has chairs with cushions. This was my biggest complaint. It is hard to sit all day on fake plastic wicker beach chairs. So by about 9:00 the best chairs at the pools (under umbrellas) and at the beach in the shade were already reserved. My husband went down at 7 each morning to put towels and magazines on the chairs in the shade that we wanted. At 8 you can wait on line for a worker to set up an umbrella on the beach for you. People who came down at 11 were out of luck for chairs or umbrella's. We saw a lot of angry people. However, I will remind you that this was Easter week and probably if you go at any other week it wouldn't be so cutthroat.", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cThe place was wonderful . . .\u201d", "Author": "WMTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR7365536", "Content": "I just returned from a stay at this resort and found it to be wonderful!

I would say that most of the other reviews on here give a reasonable portrait of the property. Nonetheless, there are a few things I'd like to point out that I think are important to booking a stay there. The good: - Grounds - The hotel is a lovely property. We found the room to be very spacious and very clean. A bit utilitarian (tile floors) but wise choices given the beach location. The beachfront itself is fantastic, some of the best in Puerto Rico. There are two pools which are very attractive. On both the beach and by the pools, there are always enough chairs. - Drinks - As others have noted, the bartenders make fantastic mojitos, pina coladas, and frozen mojitos. - Entertainment - Great tennis, golf, casino and lots of bars and restaurants. You certainly could have a pleasant vacation without leaving the grounds (though I would strongly advise going off grounds). The hotel can book virtually any activity for you (at their inflated prices, of course). - Family friendly - For those that have kids, it seems to be a great place for kids, but.... The bad: - Kids - Obviously Easter weekend is the worst of the worst in terms of there being crowds and lots of families. The hotel does a great job of providing things for kids to do and it is a safe environment for them, generally, though we did see the hotel serving extremely young minors alcohol on one occasion. We stayed on the beach and away from the pool, where most of the kids were (even the \"quiet\" pool was full of screaming kids) so it did not bother us. They didn't make too much noise in the halls, though i could see that being an issue. - Service/Speed - I simply don't buy the concept of \"Caribbean time\" and as long as I am at an American-owned resort I consider extreme slowness and incompetence unacceptable. The hotel first tried to put us in an out-of-the-way room with two double beds until we complained and got the king we booked. Because the hotel is also the country club for wealthy locals, I repeatedly noticed that Puerto Rican locals were treated much better than out of town guests. The bartenders at the pool area were almost comically slow with drink service, to the point where other guests were yelling at them as they stood joking around, entering their tips into the computers, and otherwise not serving people. - Restaurants - The breakfast at Marbella was fairly good. We also had dinner at Aqualuna, the seafood place. It was pretty mediocre. Prices are basically on the higher end of New York prices, but the quality is not there - typical of a beach resort. Even for New Yorkers, we got some sticker shock when we saw that the Italian restaurant was charging nearly $30 for plates of pasta. There are several local places that are enjoyable, including Antojitos down the street. We also liked Las Vegas, just down the road, for dinner. We stayed here on Starwood points over a very busy weekend and were generally pleased with how the hotel handled the crowds. It was of course annoying that service was sometimes slow, and I was irked, though not surprised, at how much they nickel and dime you (nothing is complimentary, including in room internet). If you want an easy place to stay, it's a good place, and I note that on the following Monday (our last day) it got much quieter and more relaxing. Overall, not much about the place surprised me.", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scranton, Pa", "Title": "\u201cWe really enjoy this resort!\u201d", "Author": "Glenncz", "ReviewID": "UR7323326", "Content": "Family and I just back from 4 nts Easter Vacation spent at the Westin PR. Great Hotel!, in fact I enjoyed it so much I am signing up for the Starwood credit card and plan on visiting other Westins throughout the Caribbean. The room was upscale with nice bathroom.

We found shady spots under the palms available at noon each day. (instead of rushing for umbrellas in a.m. - typical in carib). Only guests were on beach, no beach vendors to bug you, good riddance! Nice, very light surf for bobbing around. The food at the resort was very good and priced right. We found no significant delays in waiting for service anywhere. The staff was not \"slow\" and slothful like in some resorts, this is USA you know! I refuse to stay in prison at any resort, so our rental car took us to Don Pepe's and Mio's for very good meals in nice surroundings, the other two nights we ate at the resort. Also enjoyed local PR breakfast pastries each morning. We had an A1 guide on our rainforest tour, worth the extra $$(instead of just driving up) for all the history and local color he brought to the tour. I don't golf but the golf course(s) were quite green and looked \"up to par\", not like the dried-out brown ones I've seen elsewhere.

This was a great hotel. It's not a Four Seasons, but given that the rates were about 1/2 of a 4Seasons, I think it was a good value. We used SPG points for our room and we ended up with an Ocean view 1br suite (we paid for this with points - not an upgrade). Pros: beautiful, gorgeous property with palm trees, a private beach, 2 pools, hot tubs, water slide. Very spacious rooms with comfortable beds. Contrary to the posters below, we had very good housekeeping, although they did forget turndown at least 2 nights (they came as soon as we called). The breakfast buffet was expensive - albeit no more than any other buffet in any other upscale carribbean hotel. They never even charged us for our kids! Not once! Room service was very fairly priced, and I thought the room service staff went out of their way for us - 1 day my kids wanted a vanilla doughnut and they actually went down to the buffet and got it for her and brought it to the room. Cons: as stated here a million times, this hotel is drastically understaffed, which makes no sense, especially in PR with an unemployment rate of 20%, There is little organization, and getting chairs by the pool on a holiday week required a serious plan of action- umbrellas were generally gone by 6:45 am (NOT kidding!) and more than 2 chairs together were gone by 8am,. Having primarily stayed in 4 or 5 star hotels, I went down to the pool the first day with a $20 in hand thinking I would pick my chairs...hahaha. They weren't even interested! Lunch at the pool restaurant (Coqui) took 2 hours one day. As mentioned before, we only received turndown 2 or 3 nights out of our 5. Food is expensive, but again no more than the Ritz or the El Conquistador. Oh, but for an international management company...not ONE piece of Matzah during passover - and I heard many many tables asking for it! All in all, my kids had a fabulous fabulous time. They had tons of activities for everyone from hairbraiding, to smores on the beach to iguana feeding, all free. The hotel was overrun with kids (school holiday week) but I thought they were pretty well behaved, considering.

We stayed here a few years ago. The hotel is nicely situated and has lovely grounds. Very relaxed atmosphere and generally staff were pleasant and motivated to please.The large stretch of beach, this property fronts is lovely. The water was clean and inviting. Yes, I do agree with some of the negatives regarding the limited, expensive food choices, but we made the best of it. We remembered this issue from our prior stay,but we wanted to give it another try-hoping for some inprovement. I must note that we stayed our last two nights at The Ritz Carlton, near Old San Juan area.Surprisingly, we preferred the Westin due to what we valued as important for our vacation stay. We liked the idea of being away from the city-more importantly-the airport.(the sound of airplanes/smell of fuel was disturbing) It was nice to just relax and not feel that we had to leave the property to dine. Some dinners were dissapppointing-but some were very good and enjoyable-despite the expense. We have stayed at other resorts where the meals were at least equal or more costly so we were not shocked. If you truly like to be out and about and have access to the nightlfe of Old San Juan area, then yes staying here might not be the best choice. But if you are looking for a relaxing beach resort experience without the need to have something to do every night then this might be what you are looking for. We did do a one day shopping/lunch in Old San Juan-which was enough for us.Some more adventurous people visit the Rain Forest nearby. The Casino is small(in comparision to the one at The Ritz) but adequate. They have a David's Cookies that has ice cream, cookies, desserts, and coffee. In the morning you can get coffee/ muffin for low cost breakfast. We mostly ate at the bar area which had a very nice delux continental breakfast for $15.00 including tax/gratuities. Thought this was a great deal and very good. Dinner at their main dinning room, Meres was very good. Lunch at Coqui was good-but do avoid dinner there. We ate twice at the Italian restaurant-Palio-which was very good. Service tends to be slower than what you would expect or hope for, but found that to be the tendency.

We were up and out of our room by 10am only to return at 5pm to find the room as we left it. Every restaurant is a rip off, and the food extremely disappointing. Unfortunately there is nowhere else nearby so you are forced to waste your money on what they offer. The concierge sent us by shuttle to a restaurant slightly away from the main hotel. Only to arrive there and after waiting for 15mins they told us the restaurant was fully booked! No organization within the hotel. We saw this pattern over and over again. We rented a car from Avis who has an office on site. A $5 per day parking rate was offered due to the rental car, and when I reminded the front desk agent about the discount she was nothing but rude and demeaning and refused to budge.

I have two boys, ages 5 and 7, and I had my worries about traveling here. My husband and I had been to PR about 15 years ago without kids and said we wouldn't go back. Well, I am glad we decided to ignore our past trip. This was the best family vacation we ever had! Because of the fact that we booked so late, we had to take what we could get, so we had to move to the Marriott Stellaris after that, which I will also review under that name. Driving to the hotel is not all that scenic and we got lost right off the bat. In fact, just outside the hotel grounds it is quite seedy. This kind of puts you at the mercy of the hotel for eating options and anything you might need. You can drive about 15 minutes and see better civilization, which we would have done if we were there longer. I heard there was a WalMart nearby. Check in was smooth. We had an ocean suite, which was quite spacious and the view was beautiful. I must say that I expected more from a Westin hotel. It was a tad run down in my opinion, but still appealing to the eye. Our first day we spent in the rain forest, which was a great day and the kids loved it. The second day we took a snorkel tour which is booked by the dive shop there and they drive you to the marina where the catamaran is. My complaint about that is that 5 catamarans leave at the same time, all anchor at the same island and this makes for a very crowded scene when trying to snorkel. The kids had a ball though. Then they take you to another reef and you snorkel there also. A little tip; wait to snorkel. Most people only spend about 45 mins in the water and then come back to the boat to eat and drink. The water is free of people at that point and you'll have plenty of time. Next time I will seek out a more private way to do this, but for our purposes this time around, it worked out okay. I did this for a fishing trip in the lagoon and it worked out well; just the 4 of us and the captain fishing for tarpon. It was a great day. [--] The hotel has an igauna feeding at 11:00 every day, and we all thought that was really cool. You meet at the towel hut by the pool and follow the leader. There's a David's Cookies by the casino and that's where we got our morning coffee and a bite to eat. However, they need to either make the place larger or offer another place to get coffee quickly. There was ALWAYS a line and the service was slow. One evening I bought a couple of beers at the bar and brought them up to our room. My husband thought his tasted funny. When we looked at the born on date it was 2 years old!!!! I brought them back down and they exchanged them without a problem. I would return to this hotel, however I might try something different first. When we moved to the Marriott, we were able to walk out of the hotel and get things we needed and also check out some local food. It was two vacations in one for us.

We were a little nervous staying at the Westin as the reviews are so mixed. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed the hotel. We were debating between the Caribe Hilton and the El Conquistador. We were very happy with our choice. We booked the hotel by calling the Westin and were given the lowest rate with AAA over the phone. It was 278 for ocean view per night plus taxes and resort fees. As mentioned earlier the resort fees are expensive so the room was about 340 per night with the extras. Yes the resort is remote so I would strongly recommend getting a car at the airport otherwise you are stuck on the property. We parked each night in the employee lot accross from the main lot and this was free otherwise parking was 15 per night. We booked one room for the four of us with two double beds and balcony. The room was clean and about average size. The view was toward the ocean but you really had to be on the balcony to see the ocean. We tried to upgrade as we are Starwood Gold but the hotel was overbooked and we could not move. I think we could have moved the next day but my kids were settled in so I did not try. The bedding was nice but the beds were not like the heavenly beds at other Westins. They were OK but not nearly as nice as the normal heavenly beds. The bathroom was nothing special with only one sink and tub shower combo with adequate hot water and water pressure. The housekeeping was fine and the room was kept clean each day. We did have a rollaway brought in as our kids don't like to sleep together so it was a little cramped and they also brought a small refrigerator which was nice to keep beer and soda to take to the beach. There was no charge for the frig or the extra bed. The TV was 27 inches with an OK selection of channels but no movie channels. The Beach as the Westin was great. Large and clean with plenty of chairs and umbrellas. The waves were great and my 12 year old played for days with her boogie board. (we bought the boards at Walgreens for 9.99 and it was much cheaper than renting it from the hotel) The pools were also very nice but most of our time was at the beach. I believe there were activities at the pool but our kids did not do any of them. The workers at the Westin were all nice and helpful, except for the people handing out towels at the pool. We ate mostly at David's cookies for breakfast with scones and croissants. The prices were reasonable and OK food. We had buffet breakfast once at Meribels for about 23$ for adults and kids were half price. It was a little disappointing but the omeletes and bagels with lox were nice. The fruits were not good without any type of berries and a weak selection of pastries. We tried to leave the hotel for most of the dinner meals as the reviews of the hotel food had been so bad. We did eat at Shimas asian type food at the Westin and it was pretty bad and expensive (entres 27-38 and tea bag for $4.00). This convinced us to leave the hotel for dinners. Most of our lunches were by the pool and the service and food was usually pretty good and prices were typical for carribean or hawaii. Entres and sandwiches between 11 and 15. Kids meals were $6 and were pretty good. For dinner we would try and leave the resort. We ate twice at La Perilla (or shack #2) at Loquilla beach about 10 minutes away. It was by far the best meal and a lot of fun. The people were very nice and great food (entres 17-30). I am a very snobby eater and I would highly recommend this place. We also ate Richies cafe which had a nice view but the food was not very good. One night we ate in San Juan at Dragonfly which was interesting food and fun but the music was a little too loud. Our other meal was in Fajardo at Isemar (sp) A very small fish place which was also pretty good and a lot of fun. You pick your own fish and they cook it for your. We stopped here after the bio bay tour. If you go to Puerto Rico do the Bio Bay tour in Fajardo. We used Las Tortugas tours [----] and our guide was Alvin. We booked on our own and it was 40$ per person (through hotel 75$). It was a lot of fun and highly recommend it. We explored the rain forest and hiked which was great as well. Overall we had a great time in Puerto Rico. The people were nice, great weather (no rain for the entire week), great beach and fun things to do. The Westin is not like the Four Seasons but is clean and has a nice pool and grounds. It's biggest weakness is the lack of good food options nearby or on property. San juan is about 40 minutes away and most of the nearby places are not very good except for shack 2 at Loquilla.

We arrived at the hotel at 4pm-after renting a car at the airport. I would highly recommend renting a car as it came in very handy. The resort is in a remote area. Check in was fairly quick although a bit confusing as the clerk did not have the correct dates for our stay. We were shown to our room (a fairly large ocean front room overlooking the pool area/beach). The room was nicely arranged but not recently refurbished. The bed spread was dirty, the TV looked as though it had fallen one too many times but otherwise, I was impressed by the clean floor and room. We asked for fresh bedspreads and were immediately given them. We always had maid service before noon each day. We never heard anyone in the adjoining rooms but could hear noise from the hall. The hotel grounds are beautiful. The pool is a perfect temperature, uncrowded and very clean. We all loved the expansive beach and even liked the water with the waves. We were surprised by the lack of water sports offered at the beach (no parasailing, two jet skis, no banana boats,one sailboat) but not bothered by this at all. There were no vendors who came by while we were on the beach and this was nice. Umbrellas were available for free on a first come/first served basis. We did not have a drop of rain for six days although the rain clouds seem to hang over the rain forest. Be sure to tour the rain forest as it is a great but long hike. La Mina falls are beautiful.

It was expensive-about $90 for the four of us- and not very good. What it lacked in quality it made up for in convenience as we all wanted to enjoy the water and pool all day. We ate at the hotel three nights. Marabella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was AWFUL. Iguana Pub was good and had the nicest view. We wanted to eat at Pailo but we did not have long pants so we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We had nice khaki shorts and nice collared shirts but we were told that shorts could not be worn. I think it is a silly rule for the Caribbean but no big deal. Off the resort, we ate at Antojitos, Brass Cactus and Don Pepes. All were just okay. From the outside, the restaurants all look sketchy, but once inside the food was, for the most part, acceptable. However, we were a little shocked to find a bunch of dogs on the roof of the building next to Don Pepe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. We wished we had found a nice restaurant but did not see any that fit that bill. Many other guests were complaining of the same problem as well and I feel that this issue is the main downfall for the hotel. The nearby towns of Luquillo and Fajardo are not very exciting and seemed poor and almost deserted to us. We enjoyed our trip but would probably not go back. This resort is very remote and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine being without a car here.

Overall, it was a great experience. We are accustomed to traveling over popular vacation times, so we went with the understanding that the resort would be crowded, and boy was it crowded! But everyone who worked there did a pretty good job in keeping their cool despite some rude, obnoxious hotel guests. The hotel itself is beautiful and well located, if you are looking for a resort outside of the city. Access by the new superhighway is very easy and can take as little as 30 min., depending on the traffic. And there is a lot of traffic. Rent a car at the airport, as I heard that the hotel's car rental agency ran out of cars. The room was large enough for the 4 of us, and maid service as well as responses to special housekeeping requests were excellent. My husband is a Starwood Platiinum member, so we were lucky enough to stay on points, but we were not surprised that there was no upgrade available, even though they tried. Beware of the minibar- everytning in there, including water, is very expensive! Instead, go to a supermarket and stock up on essentials. All of the staff, in every part of the resort, were extremely polite and very nice to deal with. This goes especially for the concierges, who were helpful with restaurant suggestions and reservations. They have books of menus that you can browse through. We LOVED the Kiosk #2 (I think) in Luquillo, right off the highway. Fabulous food, and the owner/chef described every dish to us with such enthusiasm. On the other hand, stay away from the hotel food if at all possible. Very expensive and mediocre. So many superior options are available very close to the hotel. Do go to David's for morning coffee, and the beach bar for drinks while gazing at the ocean. If you are interested in side trips, the rain forest is a must. We took the hike down to the waterfall and it was worthwhile, but take extreme caution on the pavement as it is extremely slippery, even when wearing sneakers. (I slipped and fell and injured my foot, nothing serious but a nuisance to deal with while on vacation). Another must is kayaking on the bioluminescent bay, a unique experience- take a waterproof camera with a flash (very necessary) to document this awesome phenomenon. We did the rain forest on our own, but booked the kayaking through the concierge, and it was a little pricey but it included round trip transportation with a very nice driver.

You can stay here and not have to leave, because there's 8 restaurants, two pools, a huge beach and an abundance of activities. I wouldn't go back though. We found the restaurants overpriced for what you got (a typical evening meal for two of us with a nice bottle of wine and including tip was in the US$200 range), and the service was somewhat spotty. We went to Aqualuna for our anniversary dinner, and while our waiter was great, we felt completely rushed through our meal when our main course showed up while we were still eating our appetizers. Our meal at Palio was good, but we were surrounded by families with tired cranky kids and when we asked to move were told there was no other table available. We didn't like the location of the resort all that much (although that is totally personal preference) because it was a long way from anywhere, and there was really no way to experience the island without paying a huge amount for taxi or taking one of the organized tours. We did book with the concierge for the Old San Juan tour and the El Yunque tour and thoroughly enjoyed both. There was lots of time for just doing your own thing, which we appreciated. We liked the actual resort for places to walk and run, and while we aren't golfers, we talked to a lot of people who said the golfing was great. Evenings were a bit quiet, and we found there wasn't a lot to do if you didn't want to sit and drink in the bar. The beach bar closed at 5:30 which was disappointing because there wasn't a lot happening outside in the evenings. The staff for the most part were friendly and helpful, and the internal shuttle was convenient. Another suggestion - if you're staying in a mountain view room, ask for one that isn't on top of the parking lot/entrance to the hotel.

Got a great rate for the car on Hotwire which basically made the car rental the same price as the hotel shuttle roundtrip for two people. During our stay there were several corporate events going on and lots of people were in the lobby working away on laptops. This was great for us because the pool was always empty. Check in was very easy and the front desk staff couldn't have been nicer. We asked for an received an upgrade to an ocean front room with King bed, very nice. The room was great, clean, no bugs. The only complaint is the paper thin walls. Our neighbors set an alarm for 6 AM and it woke us up as well. The pool and beach were awesome, not very crowded and very clean. Pool bar was nice but got crowded in late afternoon. They do not take cash so you either pay by creditcard or sign to room. Drinks are outrageously expensive. $8.00 for a Corona and $9.00 for a Pina Colada. Only ate dinner at the hotel once, at the Grille Room. Very nice, great service and good food...not worth the $140 for two people. Having a car helped as we were able to leave and go off site for food. Anotojitos is on the road that leads to the Westin and is great. Inexpensive food, excellant service and cheap drinks. Could not believe we were the only people in there. La Parilla was good too. Had to wait over an hour for our food due to crowd but received drinks on the house from our server. Definately check out the BioBay tour. We used las Tortugas Adventures and they were great. A good place to eat there is Colizas, great seafood and steaks. The rain forest is nice, the entrance is near the hotel so if you have a car you can go by yourself. Casino at hotel got very crowded at night and could not even get to the tables. The cookie stand is a great place for breakfast.

Here is my take. The rio mar has 5 star, 4 star, and 3 star aspects. Here is my breakdown: ..... PLANE TRAVEL: 5 stars- Four hour direct flights from N.Y.area with many flight choices on many airlines, no connecting flights to smaller islands (which many on my plane missed because of the ny ice storm) my roundtrip was $240 ...... HOTEL LOCATION AND PROPERTY: 4.5 stars- A 30 min. car ride from the airport, set on beautiful grounds with 2 nice golf courses, lots of tennis courts, Grounds are nicely landscaped. HOTEL STRUCTURE- 4.5 stars- tasteful, rustic, lots of terra cotta&earthtones. Lobby is big, simple and beuatifull, not all white and marbleled like a four seasons, reminds me a larger version of the old Dorado Beach lobby ...... ROOMS- 3.5 stars. The rooms are a bit of an enigma to me. fairly small and rustic. BATHROOM was a bit tired looking, rust stains appearing around most fixtures, far from luxurious. BALCONY was great, held a table with 2 chairs. great for having breakfast. BED was awesome, slept better than @ home. MAID SERVICE was there by 10:30 am every morning. ........ POOL- 4 stars- One of the thing I hate most about Vacations is getting up @ 7 am to get a poolside chaise w/ umbrella. The rio mar is no different. get there early for a choice spot. pool is nice, w/ a 4 leaf clover shape, big hot tub, fairly lame water slide for a hotel like this, kids seemed to like it though. seperate adult pool was very nice and fairly quiet..... BEACH-4 Stars- no powdery white or pink sand in Puerto Rico,Just nice soft brownish sand. beach must be a mile long and 50 yards wide, lots of chaises. fairly big waves, lots of fun for adults and kids. Can get a bit rough depending on the wheather. need to comb the beach a little better! .... FOOD- 3 stars- Restaurants are very nice looking, good ambience. Prices are not unreasonable in my opinion(similar to new york restaurants). Food was mostly awfull. stick with fish or pasta. I don't know where they get their beef from, i doubt it's from cow. Even the burgers taste bad. Kids menu was actually good. everything was $6 on it. Aqua Luna had good Seafood, Palio was the best spot, pretty good Pasta. Ate at Shimas Twice(no other choice) it Was just plain bad. Went local twice, Richies(great views) and La Parilla(lots of bugs)both highly recommended from the staff. I found the food to be no better then the hotel food....... SERVICE: 5-Stars- Staff was very Accomodating, never rude. very cheerful. In my opinion 5 star staff abd service, prompt maid service a big plus...... THINGS TO DO:-5 -Stars- every hour they have different activities for those who don't like to sit. Hair braiding for kids, aqua robics, iguana feeding,kids bingo, P.M. bonfire w/ smores making, Poolside kids Movie at night. 2 golf courses, tennis, lots of excursions, they are pricey if you do through hotel(i rented a car(saved alot of money)..... OVERALL- Great family resort, not for a romantic getaway..... VALUE- While not cheap, I feel the hotel is priced right for what you get. P.S.-$70 resort fee is completely obnoxious, but i think most big resorts have this charge, it's a hoaxy charge, all the stuff you think is free is really not(complimentary room coffee,beach towels,shampoo,shuttle service,plus any thing else you think is complimentary is paid for for via the resort fee.)

After the long and slow check in process, we were sent to our room and surprised to see 2 double beds. We went back to the desk and were told there were no king size beds left, and we would have to wait until the morning. We went back to our room and realized the ocean view was really a view of the trees and pool with the ocean in the background, hardly an ocean view.

Also that there was no availability. Needless to say we spent the weekend in double beds. This was not a huge thing, but only the beginning of our experience at the Rio Del Mar. The service in the Marbella Restaurant was awful. We went for breakfast and had to obtain our own menus because we were waiting so long. For lunch, it took 40 minutes for our order to arrive- they were waiting for the pizza to cook. Each day, a new miscellaneous charge appeared on our bill, whether we were double charged for lunch or charged for the mini bar which we did not use. The front desk was condescending if anything, unhelpful and unable to provide the service that most people expect. It was unacceptable. The food in the Grille Room could be compared to Outback Steakhouse but 3 times the cost. The day BEFORE we were to check out, we received our bill under the door. We had to again go to the front desk who claimed we were checking out that day, but again, provided them with the paper confirmation to show that we were checking out the next day. Later that day, our room key did not work, because even though we had fixed the problem, they did not fix it in the system.

For the price, you don't get much. The room is nice but the sevice, food, and the resort itself left much to be desired. Firstly, the service and food. It took the maid service until late afternoon to clean the room and then each day didn't bring towels. I suppose I use too many towels because that sign that says, \"try to conserve\" was left on my bathroom sink. Isn't that my prerogative? Service in the restaurants is much worse. You do very little eating and a lot of waiting. BTW, all of these things are taxed and gratuity included which is why they don't care. Prepare to spend 15 dollars on a burger at the poolside grill so even a snack with tax and tip will cost an arm and a leg. Their main restaurant was good although not work the $150. Also, expect to get additude from the staff. Finally, the resort itself. After coming from El Conquistador, the Westin was like a small motel. It is definitely stuffier (the high price tag has to go somewhere), but really didn't have much to offer. There are 2 small pools and a couple of restaurants. Not worth $500 a night! Get ready for your bill when you leave. Each day you are charged for maid service (can't I decide how much to leave?) plus tax, resort charge (what resort?) plus tax, etc. The whole bill without even charging any extras to the room was 3 pages long.

My husband had a 4 day conference and we stayed on for 3 vacation days. Because it was for a conference, we didn't have a choice in staying there. Based on reviews here, the location and the amenities offered, I honestly would not have selected this resort and after a 1 week stay, I would not recommend this resort to others. First things first, many people have stated and people still seem to be surprised so I will repeat it, the resort is a 30 minute drive from San Juan and it can take up to 1 hour if there is traffic. If you don't rent a car, you will be stuck at the resort and subject to poor service and average, overpriced food. The positives:- I found the concierge helpful, particularly with off-site restaurant recommendations, the common areas of the resort are nice and I enjoyed the \"quiet\" pool. The gym has decent equipment and the preplaced towel and water bottle at each machine is a nice touch. Staff in the gym and spa were helpful and attentive. I had a swedish massage and thought it was great. While I wasn't particularly impressed with the beach, others in our group did enjoy it. It was particularly windy while we were there and the red flags, indicating rough/dangerous water, were up most of the time. The negatives- maybe I haven't noticed this at other resorts- but the $39/day resort service fee seemed a bit steep, particularly when you still have to pay for golf, tennis, spa treatments and excursions as well as the $30 room tax . We did not have a problem getting reservations the 2 times we ate dinner at Palio's and Aqualuna. We thought the food was average and the pricing was okay at these restaurants. Service was slow and not particulary attentive. Service was particulary bad/slow/inattentive and I did have a problem with food quality, selection and pricing at Marbella and Club Coqui. Marbella's is the restaurant that serves breakfast and the staff really push the buffet, which I found to be average. The a la carte menu has a decent selection of standard breakfast items- but seriously, $6.00 for a small bowl of oatmeal?? $4.00 for 1 Dannon yogurt?? $5.50 for a bowl of Cornflakes?? We had to repeatedly ask for drinks It was not unusual to wait at least an hour for our food to be served after we had ordered at Coqui or by the pool. I was willing to overlook the negatives listed above, until the real negative emerged. The one that still grosses me out and was the absolute \"deal breaker\" for me is that there are in fact bed bugs. I had read about this in advance, but did not believe until several people in our group had to be moved to other rooms and the hotel began to exterminate. Unfortunately, on the last morning of our trip, my husband and I both woke up covered in bites. I've never had this happen Two years ago, I stayed at the Wyndham El Conquistador, which is about 20 minutes further on Rt.3. It was it's drawbacks- it's huge, requires a funicular to get to different areas of the resort and the beach is a ferry ride away, but I wouldrecommend the El Conquistador over the Westin for sure.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "pittsburgh,PA", "Title": "\u201cexpensive and not so safe.\u201d", "Author": "reddyn", "ReviewID": "UR6616606", "Content": "We just came back from a conference in PR. Many people stayed at the hotel, some at the Villas which are considered separate from the hotel. The Westin is pretty standard, what would you would expect. There were some general complaints from the attendees I thought I would relate. First, there is a daily $40.00 resort fee that is tacked on to the hotel rate, which most people thought was little high. They charged $10.00 for a Pina Colada. Compared to the rest of the island, this is very expensive. A glass of Orange juice cost $5.50. Interestingly, despite charging a resort fee, there are signs stating \"swim in the ocean at your own risk\". There was a lifeguard stationed at the beach daily but clearly was just there for show. I know this because, I experienced a near-drowing incident while there. I'm a fairly strong swimmer but got caught in the waves; I yelled for help repeatedly but the lifeguard was too busy staring at the sand, and was not sitting in the designated lifeguard chair; elevated , he might have noticed my distress. Fortunately, I managed to get to the shore but my situation could have ended badly. I told the manager about the incident, but the days following, I noticed that the lifeguards showed little interest in watching the water. Comparatively the Ocean villas were much nicer and with the availability of te kitchen, I thought was a much better deal. The rates for these are as quoted and no hidden charges upon checking out. Unfortunately, this resort is very far from town and the airport ($60.00 to airport, $80.00 one way to town). We went to Old San Juan our last night, and realized it would have been nicer to be near Old San Juan with the multitude of restaurants, shops and cafes; very quaint. If you stay on the resort, you have little choice but to pay the exorbitant prices without a great deal of luxury which makes this hotel in my opinion overrated.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cA Happy New Year at the Rio Mar\u201d", "Author": "travelbugs5", "ReviewID": "UR6590520", "Content": "I have to preface this review by saying I might be a bit more critical had I been paying $800 per night for my room! As it was we paid half that for one day (coupon) and the other nights were on Starwood points, so we didn't have too much to complain about from the get go. The Westin Rio Mar is set on a beautiful beach northeast of San Juan. The property is lovely, and the landscape is beautiful. I never grew tired of looking at a lagoon pool with palm trees and a stretch of beach in the background! The staff was friendly, and efficiency kind of depended on the luck of the draw. I agree Caribbean time is very laaaaaaaaiiiiddddddd baaaaaccccckkkkkk! If you're in a hurry, go to a large bustling city. We wanted to leave that behind so the big slowdown was not a problem. Our worst service was at a local restaurant that was highly recommended on this website (La Parilla). We waited over an hour for our food! But I have to say, it was worth the wait...more flavorful and a much better value than anything we ate at the hotel. You really must rent a car if you go to this property. It made all the difference for us. For one thing, it sounds like (and was the case for us) most of the restaurants go on some kind of hiatus throughout the year. There were a mere 5 restaurants open during the busy New Year's week. That's out of 12! Oh, but David's Cookies was a lifesaver, with bagels in the morning and ice cream at night....I would imagine that's a staple there, and doesn't close seasonally. We ate at Shimas. It was pretty good. I would say our sushi at home is much better but they had a dessert that was the best thing we ate in Puerto Rico....a banana crepe with vanilla/macadamia nut ice cream. Maybe skip the sushi, get their entree, and GET DESSERT THERE! Marbella is a restaurant right off the lobby serving your basic family fare. A salad was $14 to $16 and sparse to say the least. As you might expect from a resort hotel, you will pay up on food and drinks. Tropical drinks poolside are $9 so plan ahead to pay up because they are frozen and fabulous and you can order from your chaise on the beach, at the pool or in the hot tub. It's quite the treat! The Club Coqui, the restaurant that's poolside was a huge ripoff. We paid $82 for lunch there one day for the five of us...and not for any feast, either! The trouble is, there aren't a lot of options for lunch and we wanted to stay on the grounds. So in a sense, they've gotcha! Definitely hit the bakery at the corner of Rt. 3 where you turn in for the resort. They have great sandwiches and are super friendly there. Wish we had discovered that earlier in the trip. Seeing the rainforest on our own was great. It's very close to the resort. I don't think I would have wanted to pay the hotel tour fee times five. We did fine on our own and hiked to the waterfall--gorgeous. The path was clearly marked. It WAS NOT muggy and buggy like I'd imagined, but cool and comfy. But wear gym shoes! Leave plenty of time for Old San Juan. We cut it too close to our return flight, ran into traffic, and had a hard time parking, which was disappointing because it looked really fun. Plan a half day at least for Old San Juan. But the thing is, you'll find it hard to leave this nice resort. We loved the climate, too, where you never broke a sweat, but were always comfy and warm. Shade was plentiful so staying outside all day between the pool and beach was no problem. The lounge chairs at the quiet pool are especially nice and if you have a great book, you may never want to leave! One funny thing...I was disappointed that our ocean front view (which is extra $$ as well as higher points) was blocked by a huge palm tree. We decided to live with it, but the third day they trimmed all of the palm trees and our view improved 100%. You'd think we had requested that! It was like night and day and the latter part of the week we felt we had the best view in the place. We really enjoyed our stay. No, this Westin wasn't a perfectly oiled machine like some we've stayed at. We travel a lot, but critique our vacations by how much fun we have as a family. We were so happy to be away and in a warm climate that I think nothing bothered us too much. We had a blast.

If I would have paid the regular rate of almost $700/night, maybe not. Read on and judge for yourself... POSITIVES: 1. The beach is absolutely beautiful. It is a soft, brown sand. Did like the idea that the beach is not that large so the walking is minimized. In fact, the entire hotel is compact, not spread out. You can go way out into the ocean and only have the water come up to your waist. Was not completely impressed with the water though. Could not see to the bottom, but the colors were pretty. Have been in much prettier waters elsewhere. We were there at the end of December and ventured into the water every day. The beach would be the only reason to return. The hotel provides complimentary lounge chairs and umbrellas, but go early to get one during busy season. 2. The main pool has a slow curvy waterslide. (Been to Nick hotel so every other waterslide is slow compared to that place. Unfair? Yes, but oh well.) The other pool is for quiet relaxation. There was also a bouncer, a small selection of kids activities, a playground and a tiny ferris wheel. 3. We did not experience any of the staff problems as other writers did, but maybe because we speak some Spanish? Not sure. Overall the service in the Caribbean runs on its own time, so we're used to things being a bit slower. We had some requests and everything was taken care of to our satisfaction. We actually found the people to be very sweet, helpful, always smiling and kind. 4. Took the rainforest tour offered through the hotel. Was just going to rent a car and go because we're not the \"touring\" type, but massively happy we didn't. Take the tour. It is so incredibly worth it. Our driver was Harry, amazing guy. He told us he's \"Neurican - Puerto Rican born in New York.\" 5. Our room was large, but not luxurious per se. We were upgraded to an ocean view - not a full straight on view, but we could definitely see the ocean. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom spacious, but not luxurious. Larger balcony with table and two chairs. 6. Free wi-fi in the lobby, but not in the room. I think it was 14 something per day. 7. Small casino on premises. 8. Iguanas - they are everywhere. Truly a sight to see. Some of them are really, really big. 9. Did like the idea that the food areas are mostly indoors and air-conditioned, unlike other caribbean properties that are open air. NEGATIVES: 1. Food. YIKES! We met a man who said he's been going to the property every single year at the same time for the last seven years. He said the food is absolutely some of the worst he's had at any Westin. Other people in the jacuzzi were laughing and telling rotten food stories... Shimas is the only restaurant that was edible. This restaurant offers a combo of Asian fare. Not the best, but compared to everything else it's great. Make restaurant reservations when you make hotel reservations. Every night we were there, the only time available was 9:30. The main restaurant downstairs had a buffet and regular menu. We ordered plain pasta. It came to the table uncooked! The selection at the buffet was of 5 hot items. And the prices are typical Westin rates for yucky food. We heard room service was better, but didn't get a chance to try that. They also have this quick serve coffee shop with cookies and breads. One night they ran out of decaf coffee. That was kind of interesting.... 2. Kids arcade - way too small and extremely loud. 3. Shopping - One hotel gift shop - cannot charge to your room without a picture id. Bothersome policy that should be told to guests upon check in. Small selection of beachwear and of all things, sandals. You would think that in a place like this that sandals would be plentiful, but not at this Westin. There was also a very small kiosk selling some kind of painted things. The only other place to shop on property is a dive shop by the pool. That's it. Hotel definitely needs to add some sort of shopping area. 4. Hotel location - about an hour from Old San Juan. Pretty inconvenient unless you're planning to go to the rainforest. Once you turn off the main road, you still have to head up another road and then go over a multitude of speed bumps, etc. Once you get to the hotel, you really can't leave unless you have transport. No drugstore or market anywhere in walking distance. In fact, I do not recall seeing a drugstore within at least 30 mins of the hotel. We stayed at this hotel for a few days after a cruise. Next time would probably just stay closer to Old San Juan. We don't believe we'd just decide to vacation in Puerto Rico for a week or something like that.

We were nervous about renting through an individual owner, so we went through Rio Mar Realty, which is apparently the only \"official\" company that is approved by the Westin. The condo itself was really lovely - - spacious, modern, nicely furnished, beautiful views. The only problem was the service which, frankly, is something we have found each time we have gone to Puerto Rico. We arrived late, and were told by Rio Mar Realty to check-in at the main hotel where there would be an envelope waiting for us with keys, etc. But when we got there, nobody seemed to know what was going on. We waited for over 1/2 hour while people searched for it before we finally happened to notice an envelope with our name on it sitting right in front of the person at the registration desk! Then, nobody seemed to know where our golf villa was. There are several \"clusters\" of them, it was dark, it was our first time there - - and noone could tell us how to get to our villa. Truly unbelievable. We ended up just driving around until we luckily stumbled upon the entrance to our cluster! Good thing we had a car, especially since the villas are a good distance from the main hotel and there is no shuttle! We finally found our unit, unpacked, and got into bed - - only to find that the AC in the bedrooms had some sort of rattle and was so loud each time it cycled on that we were up all night. We also found that the internet was not working, as promised. This was a problem since my husband had work that he had to do for his office. We contacted Rio Mar Real Estate first thing the next morning and told them of the two problems. Nothing was done. We called them twice a day for our entire stay. Each time we were told that they would take care of it - - and then did absolutely nothing! We ended up keeping the AC in the bedrooms off, and blasting the one in the LR so we could keep cool, and going to the lobby of the Westin to use the internet. Not exactly what we had anticipated for the price we were paying for the condo! Also had a problem receiving an important UPS package that was sent to my husband. Again, after noone could locate it, we found it ourselves at the hotel! Despite these issues with the realty company, we were glad to be in a condo and not in the Westin itself, which was absolutely packed with people! True, it was vacation week, but the Westin didn't have enough restaurants, beach chairs, etc., to accomodate the enormous numbers of people. The other problem with the Westin is that there is inadequate drainage on the golf courses. Since it rains a LOT in that area (it is right next to the rainforest, after all), you would think that they would have planned for this. No such luck. Even when the sun was shining, the courses were so water-logged that they were completely unplayable. So, those who chose the Westin in order to golf were sorely disappointed. These problems aside, the area around the Westin is beautiful and has a lot to offer. But if you go, do make sure you have rented a car so that you can take advantage of restaurants and activities outside of the resort. We went to Luquillo beach, which was lovely and uncrowded. We also went horseback riding and hiking in the Rain Forest. If you try to arrange these things through the hotel, the mark-up is ridiculous (for example, a two hour horseback ride is $60 per person if you book it and get there yourself and $93 per person if you book through the Westin. If you are a family of four that really adds up! ) Also, the food at the resort is, predictably, very over-priced and with the exception of the Italian place, not that good. We had wonderful meals in restaurants in the nearby towns of Luquillo and Fajardo (La Parilla, Lolitas and Pasion por el Fogon were especially good), and they were a fraction of the price. So, if you want a warm location that is not too far, not as expensive as most, and in a beautiful place with a lot to do and see, this may still be a good choice - - just don't go expecting great service!", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cThey must pay for their 4-5 star rating - This is NOT a high service hotel\u201d", "Author": "jerseygirl_TRIP", "ReviewID": "UR6548252", "Content": "After reading the many reviews and being familiar with Westin properties we ventured to think for the price we were paying ($800/night) we would be staying at a high quality hotel away from the hustle and bustle of San Juan.

The snotty hostess still told me I dd not have a reservation even after their own folks confirmed it. This issue was not resolved until the manager stepped in.

The hotel staff while at first seems helpful, they will stop mid conversation and begin to go do something else before finishing up with you. The weather last week wasn't great, which is obviously not anything that can be controlled, but I believe because of where it is on the island that is why we experienced so much rain. We met a young man on the plane on the way home who had actually stayed at the Hyatt Villas and said they had 1 hour of rain the whole week, I've traveled all over Europe, the Carribean, and the US and this is the one place I can say I will NEVER return.

The staff at the beach was so nice and friendly and helped us find chairs and umbrellas without us even asking. There are cabanas available for a charge but the free padded chairs are equally wonderful. The two pools were also awesome. There was a fun pool with a water volley ball court, water slide, and huge jacuzzis. There was also a quiet pool for those who chose to lounge. Lots of free pool activities went on such as FREE HAIRBRAIDING and FREE WATER AEROBICS. Everynight they start a bonfire and have free s'amore making and they have dive-in-movies at the pool. There were also lots of iguanas around the property which was a neat experience and there were daily iguana feedings as well. We ate breakfast daily at their buffet. It was pricy but extremly delicious. We also tried their Italian restaurant one night and I had the best fettichini alfredo I had ever had in my life! I'm a tennis player and I must say, the courts were VERY impressive. They were clay courts and they had a very nice complex. However, tennis charges were very pricy so I didn't play as often as I would have liked to. The casino looked fun but we didn't spend any time there. But if you're going to be traveling with a family, don't worry about it. We were in a room right by the casino and we didn't hear a thing.

The staff who checked us in did a great job and were very nice. The staff at the poolside were not as good, and one time I placed a beverage order which never showed up so I went to the poolside bar myself to get it. It wasn't a big deal, but that's not great service. There are 2 pools + a kiddy pool. The first day we sat at the adult quiet pool but then the other days we sat by the activity pool. Even though we liked the quiet of the adult pool, the activity pool got more sun. We had no problem getting seats by the pool. In terms of food, our package included breakfast, which is served buffet style and had made-to-order omelets as well as many other selections. The hotel restaurants are average for dinner. Expensive and mediocre (but not terrible) food. We ate at The Grille Room, Palio and Shimas and I'd say you can skip Shimas. We also ate one night \"off campus\" at Don Pepe, a local restaurant recommended by the concierge, and it was terrific! Go there! We enjoyed the spa. They were always running late, but you atill got the full-time of your service. We didn't bring our kids, but it seems to be a very kid-friendly place.... it was packed with families. The casino is small but on a busy night, it did open up some additional blackjack tables. We chose the Westin over the Ritz Carlton mostly because the Ritz Carlton rooms do not all have balconies, and I love to read outside on the balcony in the AM while my husband sleeps late. I ddin't price out the Ritz this time, but my guess is that the Westin is also more reasonably priced.

The food was amazing. The room was clean--no bugs, dirt, etc. The grounds were well-kept, the concierge was more personable than any other I have come in contact with.

Even with the rainy weather we had, the concierge was able to recommend an alternative to the snorkeling trip we had and we ended up having a fabulous time with the old san juan tour.

Yes, they are expensive, but we expected it since we did our research--I really think it's funny that people complain a lot about costs--the website has all their menus on it, along with prices--so if you are reading this review right now, you obviously have access to a computer---DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFOREHAND!!

Overall, it was 'average', and we likely would not return. We are both serious golfers and booked the 'unlimited golf package' because of the two highly rated courses on the property. This pkg. included breakfast daily, no other meals. We did not rent a car, so stayed within the property. FYI..If you have a rental car you will have to pay $15/day to self-park, or $20/day for valet parking. Beware that many of the \"12 restaurants\" are closed, so choices are limited. Food is more expensive than expected even for a resort property. Make dinner reservations as soon as you arrive and scope out what is or will be open during your stay. I recommend the Iguana Pub at the golf course for lunch and dinner, more reasonably priced and good choices available. The people/ employees are very nice, and service was good, which made it a more pleasant experience. the grounds are impeccably clean and well maintained. Beach was beautiful, sandy and warm, no rocks, easy to enjoy. Rooms were clean and neat. We booked an 'ocean view' room and were given a room with the tiniest balcony. Golf course catered to members and not resort guests. The nicer of the two courses, The Ocean, we were only allowed to play on twice. You may be disappointed that on \"the ocean\" course you will only be near the ocean very briefly on hole #16. Blink and you will miss it. River course was nice, runs along a noisy highway, but still a challenge. Hotel seems to be primarily focused on convention business and professional meetings. Pool area was closed off at certain times for their private receptions. On a good note, they smartly have a \"quiet pool\" and another pool for children and families. Management is interested in feedback and held a small cocktail reception one evening asking guests what they liked and disliked about the stay.

We rented a car from Hertz at the San Juan airport and drove to the Westin. Here is a tip: the Hertz trip computers at the desk will route you to the Westin via Route 23 (I think that is it), but Route 66 is MUCH faster. 23 is a busy street with stop light on almost every corner while 66 appears to be just recently opened and is more of a freeway with at least one toll booth ($1.50). However using 66 will save you at least 15-20 minutes I think. If using Hertz ask the front desk people about 66 - if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they just wave you over to the computer terminal to print out the map. Other companies may tell you about 66 on their maps. Back to the hotel. I am surprised by some of the negative reviews posted here. We found the hotel to be quite nice, with beautiful grounds, great pools and hot tubs, and a very, very nice beach. The public areas were extremely nice and our room was large and roomy and of course had the Westin Heavenly Bed. The bathroom was large, there was adequate closet and storage space, an in room safe, and coffee and tea equipment and supplies. The room was spotless in every respect. Every staff member we dealt with was polite and helpful. As we wanted to visit El Yunque (just a few minutes away) the morning before we checked out to return to San Juan to board our cruise ship I enquired about a later check out time than the normal noon. They gladly extended the check out time to 3 pm which was ideal for us, giving us time to shower and clean up before returning to San Juan. That was very generous of them. We did not eat in any of the dining areas but did use the David Cookies for bagels and cream cheese in the morning. Things at David were priced reasonably. The posted menus at the various dining venues indicated that the prices were typical for a big hotel/resort. We had dinner at a small local place just outside the gate down the road before reaching the main highway. The food was excellent, the owner was extremely friendly and the prices were reasonable.

There are several places where one can hike into the forest and see waterfalls, the trees, etc, or one can just drive around, pulling off at vista points here and there. Either way it is well worth seeing. One hint \u00e2\u20ac\u201c get there early. Since we were staying close we were there before 9am. Before we left (about noon) the place was packed with tour busses, probably from San Juan and cruise ships. We returned to the Westin, showered, packed, checked out and returned to San Juan to turn in the car and board the cruise ship. Here is another big hint. We reserved the car for airport pickup and downtown San Juan return to the Hertz office. We had a difficult and frustrating time finding the downtown office, and since we drove right past the airport to get downtown it seemed that maybe an airport turn in would have been better. However, unless Hertz offers courtesy shuttles from the airport to the docks then a cab ride would have been needed. The downtown office did provide free transfers to the cruise dock. Overall we would rate the Westin Rio Mar highly and would stay there again. We found it to be much more relaxing than staying in San Juan and being able to see El Yunque easily was a real plus.

There is a little store at the bottom of our hotel, down the road about 1 mile, so we picked up the local beer--medallah light, which was perfect for our room and some snacks. They also have wine and other items. We did not rent a car since we had already been to San Juan on a previous trip and didn't feel the need to do Old San Juan. We did the rain forest tour and booked at the hotel. It was $38pp and included transportation. We hiked in the rain forest, I wore sneakers and had a bathing suit on under my shorts. You can stop at the falls and swim if you choose. We were with a group of about 8-10 people, it was amazing. Do the rainforest--it was incredible! We also choose to snorkel and we were a little disppointed that the hotel dive shop charged $95 pp, but if you drive to the marina in Fajardo, about 20 minutes away, it was only $59. But since we choose not to rent the car, we were ok with paying extra to book with the hotel. I offst the cost of renting a car. It was a catamaran boat with open bar all day and sandwiches for lunch. It was a full day and we stopped to swim first before we went to the reef. We choose to grab a toasted bagel or nice selction of pastries at the little coffee shop near the casino in the hotel--David's Cookies. It was reasonable as opposed to splurging at the hotel restuarants. We also ate lunch at the tiki bar near the pool or the outside restaurant near the pool. This was on the reasonable side. We choose to take a cab for dinner 2 additional nights and we stayed close to the hotel and it was $14 round trip. The location and distance to restaurants is at the concerige. There are about 15 plus outside resturants. We went to this 1 near the hotel, it was called Rich's or something close to that, it was were the local's go and it was on the side on the mountain. Beautiful view. Nice meal and very reasonable. We also ate at the hotel. The Westin is 5 star, so naturally, the restaurants are 5 star. So break it up, go to the local places near by and the prices are more reasonable and enjoy your vacation and the hotel and all its ammenities too. We woud defintiely go back.

Great swimming, great relaxation. The pools were very nice as well....and we appreciated the fact that they had water spouts to rinse off your feet after leaving the beach, and also showers to rinse off the salt water....very convenient. The grounds were maticulously kept.....a BEAUTIFUL courtyard faces the ocean...and even their standard rooms (which we stayed in) had ocean views from the balcony. Wonderful. They have a parrot that they keep in a cage in the lobby area named Coco, and he is fun to converse with if you have any spare time. He has quite the attitude and is very sociable! Fun! By the way, the lobby area is gorgeous....spiral staircase, piano playing......beautiful. We enjoyed our stay at this resort VERY much! We rented a car for our entire vacation (10 days) and toured the entire island, staying at three different hotels, and I would say that is definitely the way to go. You want to be able to see all sides of the island - from San Juan and El Morro/San Cristobal and Bacardi --to Fajardo and El Yunque Rainforest and Las Croabas Biolumenescent Bay -- to Ponce and Castillo de Sorrales and the Ponce Firehouse, and La Monserratte Sea Port Diner. :-) What a wonderful vacation!!!!

The staff were incredibly friendly, the rooms were great, and overall it was a great experience. It was just as nice, if not nicer, than any other Westin I have stayed in, and I have stayed in a lot of Westins. If you read the complainers complaints closely you will notice one common thread - it doesn't seem that they did their research before they arrived at the Westin at all. Most complain that it is far away from San Juan, that they needed to rent a car, that the food was expensive, etc. So what? The location is right near the rainforest in a beautiful location. It is about a 30-45 minute drive from San Juan, depending on traffic. The beach is a beautiful beach, no, it is not the white sand, crystal clear turqouise water of the Caribbean, but that is because it is located on the Atlantic side of the ocean. Duh. Look at a map and look at the pictures of the resort before you book the trip there!! The rooms were great. The standard room is large, with a nice sitting area. It was very clean, I have no idea what a previous poster was talking about dirty rooms. We were upgraded to a junior suite after one night (once the hotel cleared out a convention, and with a $20 tip to the reception - TIP - in ANY hotel, if you want to be upgraded to a better room, be prepared to tip the person who can put you in that better room!) and it was beautiful. But even the standard room was great. We didn't really eat in the hotel's restaurants because we were on the go so much. We did eat at the coffee place next to the casino every morning, which was a good, cheap alternative to spending a lot of money on the hotel food. I did check out the food prices and thery did not seem any higher than at any other Westin, and in fact, I thought the room serive prices were quite reasonable for a large hotel (I have seen double the prices charged at other hotels). We did order room service one night and it was quick and good food. Also, rent a car and explore the restaurants around the resort, there are plenty - I highly recommend Kiosk #2 at Loquillo beach, very close to the resort. The service at the hotel is fabulous - we wanted a fridge for our room, and one was there within 10 minutes. The safe didn't work in out first room (the person prior to us didn't leave it open), and someone was there in a matter of minutes to fix it. My husband got food poisioning, and the concierge helped out immensly, getting a dr to our room immediately, and even sending someone to go get the prescription from a local pharmacy. The staff could not have done more, they are truly great and extremly friendly and care about their jobs and their customers. Overall we had a great time at the Westin and would not hesitate to return or recommend it for a great vacation. Don't listen to the whiners and complainers - honestly, if they didn't like this hotel, I cannot imagine that any hotel would live up to their expectations (I have traveled all over the world and stayed at numerous 5 star resorts - the Westin Rio Mar lived up to its 4 star rating) Here's another tip - you can book this hotel through Hotwire or Priceline for a substantial savings, which makes it an even better deal.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mco1018", "ReviewID": "UR5718326", "Content": "we stayed here for a week with our 4 year old and we all loved it.

I've read some of the other reviews about the Westin having a terrible staff and my response to that is, well, maybe if you are not nice to the staff they won't be nice to you. We got a fridge in the room and stocked up from a local grocer. And we reserved a car as soon as we booked the hotel room which was great. The hotel is 25 minutes from Fajardo, which is worth going to for the different day trips - a catamaran sailing trip - I recommend the Spread Eagle II for the friendly staff, great lunch, and beautiful views, and the nighttime bioluminescent bay tour. Both of these were very kid-friendly and accomadating. The only thing is that I would book these separately from the hotel as the hotel trips were pricey. It's only 5 minutes from El Yunque - definitely worth while, and about 35 minutes to San Juan, which left my daughter a little bit bored but had some great restaurants if you want authentic puerto rican food. all in all a great trip. great views. great service. great atmosphere.

I would not return again. In fact, I would not go to Puerto Rico again. SAN JUAN: For one, our resort was 45 min away from ANYTHING. The city of San Juan was where all the nightlife, shopping, and history was. The taxi ride from our hotel would've cost us $80.. both ways! So we rented a car for the day (only $60) and drove ourselves to the city. It only took us about 30 min to get there but it took us an hour and a half just to find a parking spot! We found that the locals in San Juan were not too fond of Americans and were rude to us. The shopping in Old San Juan was pretty nice; it had nice little souvenir shops like we were looking for. STAFF: On the resort, we found the people (fellow-vacationers and staff) to be friendly and helpful with any problems/complaints that we had. EXCURSIONS: There is not much to do at the resort besides eat and lay by the pool/beach. If you want to do a tour/excursion it is very expensive. Through the resort, snorkeling costs $90/person. We thought that this was absolutely ridiculous. When we complained to the concierge about the price, she gave us a number to call a snorkeling company directly. Through the company Spread Eagle it only cost us $65/person. This was for an all day trip. They picked us up from the resort at 9:30am and we returned around 4:30pm. They provided us with lunch (make your own sandwiches and fresh fruit, all delicous) plus pina coladas, water, and soda. Instead of going to one reef like you would've if you've gone on the trip through the resort at $90/person, Spread Eagle took us to TWO reefs. It was a very very nice trip. After we ate lunch, we went to the 2nd reef where we fed the leftover bread to the fish. This was so fantastic! We also went on the rainforest tour which happens to be the least expensive tour (only $38/person). I was very excited about this tour. There is a lot of walking through the rainforest, not much to see except trees. Don't expect to see any animals at all except maybe a bird. I was very disappointed to find that there are no animals in their rainforest. Swimming in the waterfall is cool though. ROOM: Our view from our room was beautiful. We got the mountain/rainforest view. The bed was extremely comfortable but there was no fridge in the room which I found to be very inconvenient. Also, we had food stolen from our room by the maids one morning. I was very [----] about this. The manager reimbursed us for our stolen food. CASINO: The casino is extremely small and definetly shady. My boyfriend played in the Texas-Holdem poker tournament one night and ended up leaving the table very frustrated. As soon as you sit down the dealer tells you \"no talking at the table\". This is no problem, very understandable. Unfortunately, almost immediately the spanish-speaking people start talking to each other. My boyfriend complained to the dealer about it saying, \"I thought there was no talking at the table?!\" The dealer completely ignored him. For all he knew, they were telling each other what they had! Also, after my boyfriend went \"all-in\" on a hand, one of the players folded, but then showed everyone his cards! You can't do that. The rules are not followed in this casino. Also, at the Roulette table, the dealer made a mistake on the pay-out. I would not recommend going to this casino, which is a shame because it's all there is to do at night! RESTAURANTS: We were very upset about the restaurant situation. The hotel advertised that there were 12 restaurants on the resort. When we were there, there were only 3 open, and 2 of them we couldn't get into because you needed to wear dress slacks which my boyfriend did not bring. You could not wear shorts OR jeans. This was NEVER told to us when we booked our vacation. Luckily, when we complained to the concierge about this situation, she set us up for a shuttle to the Bamboo Lounge which is located on the mountain-side. The food is very nice there, much cheaper than on the resort, and the view is wonderful. The food on the resort was ridiculously expensive, and not that good. At the Coqui Restaurant by the pool, a hamburger costs $13 and a plate of fruit w/yogurt cost me $12! There was one restaurant about 3 min outside of the resort that was just wonderful. It was a small local restaurant called Don Pepe's. The food was fantastic and cheap, the alcohol was cheap ($2 a bottle instead of $8 like on the resort) and the people there were very very friendly. I definetly recommend this restaurant if you end up staying here. We got 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 5 alcoholic drinks and it only cost us $54. BEACH/POOL: The beach was no different than any Atlantic Ocean beach back home. This was very very disappointing. The pools were nice, they were a good size. The \"activity pool\" was generally full of little kids but the \"quiet pool\" was usually pretty empty when we went in. Also, the pools are open 24 hours which we found to be useful since there wasn't much to do at night. FITNESS CENTER: I found the fitness center to be quite nice. Each cardio machine has it's own tv on it so you can watch whatever you want while working out. Also, they provide you with a bottle of water (warm though), headphones, and a towel on each machine. There were also weight machines, and stability balls which was nice. In conclusion: the best part of our trip was the snorkeling trip, and the restaurant Don Pepe's.

Check-in was good, we got upgraded to an ocean suite, but the room was ok.

The next morning, we were woken up at 6:00 AM by construction on the roof which was directly above us. We called front desk several times, and no one could explain what happened. Finally later in the afternoon, I called the manager who found out they had construction right above us. We were satisfied after he comped the night, but I still don't understand why they would give us a room underneath construction when there was so much availability in the hotel or why they would start constriction so early, people are on vacation and the last thing they want to do is wake up at 6 AM. The Food was drab, service at Marbella worse. It took me 25 minutes each day to get coffee by the wait staff. One day a gentleman next to me offered his pot after i asked the waitress 5 times for coffee to no avail (she finally brought it over right when they closed for breakfast). The Italian restaurant however, was fairly good with top notch service. The hotel grounds are somewhat old and tired. The pool area is somewhat nice, but i noticed a lot of mold on the cushions. Also, although one pool is the \"adult pool\", there were tons of small children running around, jumping in, and causing a lot of noise, this was definitely not enforced. The beach is ok, the ocean very rough and the sand is a dark yellow (not the soft sand found in the Caribbean or on other parts of the island) The location is not that great either. yes it is across the rain forest, but There really i nothing else in the area, and you are pretty much forced to stay at the resort if u don't have a car (fyi, if u have a car other than the one u can rent from the hotel, they charge u $18/day). We were pretty bored in the evenings, even thought we did go to the restaurants and casino (seemed very empty) As a side not, i am still having problems with the hotel bill.

We traveled from San Juan in a rental car. We chose Alamo - low prices, convinient to airport, and we were in and out in less than 10 minutes. Make sure to take the new toll road, Highway 66, from San Juan to just outside Rio Grande, that cuts your travel time by about 20-25 minutes. It only costs $1.50 and is really worth it as an alternative to the congested Route 3. It is so new that you won't find it on most maps yet. We arrived at the Westin in the late afternoon and were upgraded (without asking) to an oceanview room. Summer is the off season and there may be more flexibility. ROOM: Average size, attractive furniture, great beds, spotless, quiet POOLS/BEACH:There are two pools, one is the quiet pool with CUSHIONED lounge chairs, our choice. The beach is adjacent and great for boogie boarding. There are cabana for rent at $90 per day (comes with sodas, fruit, chips and ice chest). We just went down by 9ish and picked our spot under an umbrella. (Discounted with the Escape Package - see below) RESTAURANTS: The nice restaurants are somewhat expensive ($25-40 per entree) so we ate local cafes (for authentic Puerto Rican food) including Don Pepe's, Restaurante Terraza Montemar, and in San Juan. The Marbella in the Westin, has a morning full b-fast buffet ($19) but you can also order off the menu. It is also open for dinner with fair prices. TIP: We reserved the \"Escape Package\" online for which included 2 free b-fast buffets each day, 25% discount on all services, and included the resort/room tax which comes to almost 25% more. We would highly recommend this option if you can reserve it. LOCATION: The Westin Rio Mar is about 40 minutes from San Juan, very close to the entrance of El Junque Rainforest and the Fajardo Biobay (The bioluminencence was stunning-just go on the darkest night possible, by kayak, and use insect repellent!). DO NOT reserve tours thru the hotel as prices are very inflated. You will hear the chorus of the cute \"Coqui\" (frogs) at night. Don't forget to explore further south for some great beaches and scenic drives. AMENITIES: Nice bar areas with tropical flowers, tiny casino, terraces, golf, weekend outdoor movies, bakery called Mike's Cookies which is another option for b-fast) Live piano music in the lounge downstairs.

It's very easy to swim in. The pool area is equally nice and kept immacutely clean. We had a stunning room on the top floor with an ocean view, and the Westin beds live up to their heavenly name. The food at the restaurants wasn't cheap, but it wasn't that expensive either ( we're from New York). The quality was fine. Every person we encountered, from the front desk to housekeeping to the shops to the restaurants could not do enough to help you. I seriously did not encounter anyone who wasn't friendly. The kids' program is great, too. They have hair braiding most mornings at 9:00 near the pool. My daughter got 4 braids on each side and when I asked to have it charged to the room, I was shocked to find out it was free. We have travelled extensively in the Caribbean and been to Puerto Rico 4 times, and this has to have been one of our best vacations. Based on the sheer beauty of the place and the friendly staff, I recommend it highly.

We booked our room for an insanely low rate on hotwire, so we were expecting below average service and a room next to the broom closet. We could'nt have been more mistaken. Check-in was a breeze and our room was excellent (Not ocean front or ocean view, but on the first floor and overlooking a tropical lagoon that was home to the resort's iguana population). The bath was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The rooms have very nice/new in-room safes that easily accomodate Laptop PC's and other valuables. The hotel was not very crowded at all. Perhaps it is because this is Puerto Rico's down season. That was fine with us. It was basically \"no line, no waiting\" wherever we went. The beach at the Rio Mar is beautiful. The beach is actually adjacent to the well known Luquillo beach that you may read about in travel books, etc. The Rio Mar's beach is just as picturesque. More on Luquillo later. The pools were uncrowded and the kids stayed in the activity pool while we enjoyed a quieter time at the quiet pool. As long as you were poolside by 830-900AM there was no need to fret over getting a lounge chair. Finding chairs on the beach was never a problem. SOME CAUTIONS: As with any other resort and as other reviews have stated, food and drink here are a rip-off. I guess the resort figures that they will make their money back on your stay by assuming you will eat there. Well, we did not. We stopped at the corner grocery (at the corner of PR 3 and 968) and stocked up on Medalla (local light beer), Cokes, and other snacks all for about $25. I kid you not in stating that this would have cost uus at least $150 at the hotel. This tip leads me to the most important tip of all... RENT A CAR! If you don't rent a car, be prepared to be held prisioner at this resort and held subject to their high prices. We rented a car with GPS navigation from a national chain at the San Juan airport and could have not been more glad that we did so. I cannot tell you how many hotel guests we talked to that regretted not renting a car. If you want to go off resort you are subject to the resort's shuttle bus (at a fee of course). Same goes if you want to do any daytripping. Speaking of which, this hotel is a perfect location to day-trip from. El Yunque is literally 2 miles away, Old San Juan is approx. 45 minutes and Fajardo is about the same distance as Old San Juan. We spent a whole day in Old San Juan and had a blast. Parking is a bit difficult to find. My advice is to head straight to El Morro and park there. It may cost a bit more, but the lower cost lots are obscure and hard to find. Some places to stop by and see are El Catedral de San Juan. Not only is this a beautiful church, but Ponce de Leon is buried here. El Morro is really cool, definitely worth the $3 admission (kids get in for free I think). As far as eating goes, stopping by the El Convento Hotel (right across from the cathedral) to eat at El Picoteo is a must. The fare here is Spanish tapas. Their mojitos are excellent as well. El Yunque is a true treasure. We spent two half days here and are glad we split it up. The first day we dedicated to La Mina falls (a must do) and the second day we dedicated to hiking to the summit of El Yunque mtn. ~3600ft. The views up here are spectactular, you can see St. Croix and St. John from up here on a clear day (we had a clear day and did see the USVI). A disclaimer is that if you are moderately physically challenged you might have a hard time hiking these trails. The trails are well kept and actually have paved mini-sidewalks to prevent trail wash out, but they are extremely steep in places. Also do not wear flip-flops or else you will slip and fall. Buy a pair of teva's before you come. The last excursion we took was to Fajardo one evening to take the bio-bay kayaking tour in Las Cabezas de San Juan nature preserve. This experience is not to be missed. It is truly a once in a lifetime expierence. One benefit to doing the trip here is not having to take a ferry to Vieques to the Mosquito bay. See las tortugas adventures for more info. Other companies offer similar trips as well. As far as eating goes, my advice is to be brave. Authentic Puerto Rican cuisine is a wonderful blend of Puerto Rico's cultures. It mixes Creole, with Spanish and Native cuisine to create a truly unique culinary genre. The food of Puerto Rico was the favorite part of our trip. Specifically, Don Pepe's and Antonjito's are both excellent for traditional Puerto Rican Cuisine. Both are also less than a mile from the hotel and would be suitable dinner locations. Kiosk #2 at Luquillo Beach serves tradtional PR cuisine as well and is very good. Kiosk #52 is excellent for a quick bite such as a shrimp, fish, crab or chicken fritter and other traditional PR fast food. If you rent a car, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LUQUILLO KIOSKS at lunch time FOR CHEAP AND EXCELLENT FOOD all in an awesome environment. Luquillo beach is right down hwy 3 from the hotel (10min drive) and you can park right in front of the kiosks and walk right up to the kiosk of your choice. So basically, for us, the Rio Mar was a place to lay our heads, lay by the beach and pool and to take a shower. We really did not gamble or shop, but that is not why we came to PR. The casino was very unimpressive, small, etc. as others have mentioned. We came to Puerto Rico to expierence and immerse ourselves in local culture and had an excellent time doing so. The people here are extremely friendly and willing to help just as long as you are not obnoxious. We saw so many demanding an rude Americans who I think forget that they are on vacation. If you are'nt going to chill out why go on vacation at all? Safety was never a concern for us when leaving the resort. The police are literally everywhere. Every half mile we passed a cop. If you do drive in PR, it is not any different than in the US, except the max speed limit is 50mph. Do not speed as I have heard that citations were very costly. Also one more thing, the cops drive around with their light bars on at all times so if a cop comes up behind you with its lights on just let them pass. In closing, have fun in Puerto Rico and experience as much as you can!", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cWary at first, but great resort\u201d", "Author": "xqzmi", "ReviewID": "UR5181276", "Content": "We stayed at the Westin Rio Mar for 5 days. You definitely need to rent a car to get there because transportation by taxi ($60-70) or by shuttle service is too expensive. Getting to the resort was not a problem--go by Rt 66, make a right at Belz Factory Outlet onto Rt 3 and you'll see the sign for the Westin on the left. However, finding the main building in the resort was difficult, especially at night. We saw all the signs telling us, \"Caution: Iguana Crossing\" but no clear sign directing us to the hotel. Eventually we hit a deadend and a staff member helped us out. Check-in: Very fast, very smooth, and very patient to answer all our questions. We also had a fridge request (no extra charge) and that was brought to our room in 10 min. Self Parking is very efficient but pricey $10/day. Room: The first thing we did was check for bedbugs after all the reviews we read about that. We were in total paranoia, but we were lucky and there were no bugs in our beds. We were on the first floor...very high ceilings. Standard room, no frills, nice balcony...comfortable. Housekeeping wasn't always reliable. There were days when we didn't get face towels, then the next we didn't get new soap. We literally walked up to the cart and picked it up ourselves because they never delivered it to our room even after we called. Grounds: Very beautifully kept. The maintenance starts early and everything is very organized. There were plenty of towels, pool balls, lounge chairs with umbrellas around the pool. The beach is \"eh\", not the golden sand or clear blue water you imagine of the caribbean but it's still nicely kept. there are cabanas and plenty of lounge chairs there too. They have 2-3 jet skis, kayaks..but all for a price ($60 jet ski for 1/2 hour). they have activities planned everyday that are listed on a bulletin board in the lobby and outside area by the pool (power walk, iguana feeding, dancing). the casino is not very large but it's still fun to just wander around. they have a very large conference room...was not able to see inside, but we did see the outside grounds set up for a wedding. The grass in that area was extremely brown, not exactly pretty. Oh..bugs galore...must wear bug spray everywhere you go. Cannot comment on the restaurants in the hotel except for David's Cookies. We picked up something there for breakfast a couple times before going out. We mostly ate outside of the resort. We went to Las Vegas, which is en route to El Yunque on Rt 191. (El Yunque is literally across the street from Rt 968 and follow the signs to Rt 191). Isamar's bakery on the corner of Rt 968 is very good...their Cuban sandwich is really good. Along the way to Luquillo, we saw all the kiosks numbered but we didn't get to try them. We went to dinner at Sandy's Seafood, really good seafood, large portions of everything. There are plenty of fast food places around especially KFC/Taco Bell and Burger King. We also ate at Antonino's and Taco Maker along Rt 3 (east of resort). If you continue on Rt 3 to Fajardo, you'll hit a shopping plaza with sizzler, metropol, many other restaurants. Concierge: I think this was the best part of the hotel. They have directions to everything, preprinted cards. They were very helpful. However, booking through them, especially tours looks extremely overpriced. Call the tours yourself, it's a better deal. Around the Area: El Yunque is right across the street. Luquillo is a 5 minute Drive and is an overall nice beach. Not sure why it's rated as a great beach but, it is still a nice place to relax..Parking is $3. They have kayaks for rent there and it's only $5 per person...much much cheaper than the resort which was around the range of $45 for 1/2 hour. Check out: bill sent to room with easy check out form. We weren't charged a 13% resort fee--maybe it's a deal they cut out with priceline. I don't know...but i'm not complaining. Overall, this was a very enjoyable resort.

So far we have nothing but great things to say about the resort and its staff. I simply can't understand some of the negative or oddly critical comments I've read here. The resort grounds are stunning and meticulously cared for (as with all Westins). The rooms are quite attractive and very clean. The lobby and lounge areas are gorgeous and exude style. The staff is among the most friendly and helpful of any hotel at which we've ever stayed. They've gone out of their way to make us feel at home and extra special. (We also love how they've lavished attention on our two-year old daughter.) If you like golf, then this resort is a little bit of heaven, I imagine. There are two beautifully designed courses right in front of the resort. The beach is very attractive, clean and generally uncrowded. The food, while typically expensive as we've come to expect at upscale resorts, is at least very good and diverse. The Sunday brunch is fantastic and not to be missed. About the only complaint I can make is about the weather. It's pretty humid here and we're experiencing the tailend of the rainy season. I doubt the hotel has much control over this. I'll close this work-in-progress by saying, my wife and I love Westins. We've stayed at close to a dozen of their properties and have always been impressed and extremely pleased. Starwood is a first-class company, totally dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience for its guests. If you have a bad or less-than-superlative experience at a Westin or any other Starwood property, you owe it to yourself to let Starwood know.

I was anxious after reading the reviews. Luckily, I listened to a friend that visited the Westin in December, and we rented a car from the airport. We too ate in the hotel, which was pricey, and the food was average. The service was excellent even though the hotel was at capacity. The workers were very helpful getting chairs/umbrellas on the beach. The pool was crowded but I've found that to be the case at every family resort. My 11 yr old liked the s'mores by the pool and feeding the iguanas. We had a rainforest view from the 6th floor which was breathtaking. We wanted to try some different restaurants on the island and found Don Pepe's to be very good. We had excellent service and plenty of food which was inexpensive. It doesn't look appealing on the outside, but the food and environment were wonderful. We tried to visit Antojito's which was highly recommended, but it was either closed or crowded. I recommend getting a reservation for this place. It is just a tiny, outdoor, place at the bottom of the hill from the Westin, on the way to Route 3. Many people we encountered either took taxis or rented a car to visit Old San Juan or just to go outside the hotel for dinner. We went into Old San Juan and dined at the Parrot Club which was very good. The Puerto Rican Cafe, Aquavive and the Dragonfly, were also highly recommended. We stopped in the Hard Rock Cafe too. Our visit to El Yunique was wonderful also. We found the people of Puerto Rico to be extremely pleasant and helpful. Our vacation was excellent and I'd gladly go back again.

This year we thought we'd try something different...a larger hotel (more for my 13-year-old to do than our usual boutique hotels). We are used to very nice hotels. I read the previews on this site the night before we left, and many came in handy (and I knew what to expect) However they left me a bit panicked! It started off pretty bad, after a day of traveling we went to check into our \"ocean front\" room. We were told that \"it was being cleaned\" and to go enjoy a complimentary dinner. My husband was smart enough not to leave the desk, as wiithin the hour there were 20 unplaced families like ourselves. Finally at 7:00pm or so, he pulled the manager aside and said \"I know no one is checking out at 7:00pm...tell me the truth, you don't have a room for us\" The manager reluctantly agreed, no ocean front rooms availiable (probably hadn't been any since noon) Sooooo why did they lie to us? keep us waiting? Aggrevate us from the get-go? We went into an \"ocean View room\" (perfectly nice). And we spent the next 2 days and several hours trying to get our \"ocean view\" Finally we gave up, unpacked and started to enjoy vacation. HOWEVER A NEW PROBLEM AROSE...They didn't want to give us an \"ocean VIEW\" price for our \"Ocean view room\" It was their error, we were being VERY cool, and three managers kept telling us that our \"Ocean front rate was too low, that a mistake must have been made, and that was closer to the \"ocean view rate\". Fortunately, we adhered to trip-advisor Rio Mar advice #1: Bring everything in writing GET everything in writing. Even though our original check in for the ocean front went un challenged (when it was being \"cleaned\") 3 days latrer we were asked 4 times by 3 different managers to see the original price in writing. (which we did each time) Now all we wanted was the published difference between the ocean view and ocean front rates. In a hotel with 600 rooms, corporate rates, priceline, hotels etc.... there must be 35 different hotel rates, I can't believe they were surprised at our rate. We were staying 9 nights after easter when typically in the Caribbean seasonal rates go down. Eventually, a great FABULOUS professional named Gabriel, took charge, adjusted the rate to the appropriate level and put it in writing. (plus we got a fruit & wine basket). It all pretty much goes back to what so many have stated on this site, the hotel is Beautiful (as are the grounds) Really as nice as some Four seasons and Ritz'z I've stayed at, AND the PEOPLE were SOOOOOOOO friendly (nicest of any island wev'e stayed at in the Caribean) But orginizationally....they have their heads up their butts. I feel for the front desk people, it has to be more strressful than an air-traffic controller as far as jobs go. There were sooooo many screaming patrons (yet who can blame them). Don't take your frustrations out on the poor desk people, it's not THEIR policy to overbook and bate and switch. The place was family friendly, almost too loud for my taste. Ball- throwing, marco-polo playin, screamin 5 year olds in the \"quiet\" pool and adult only hot tub. Lot's of parents afraid to say to their 6-year-olds \"stop screaming in the hall when people are sleeping\" The first 3 days of the trip were over easter weekend, and I was a bit panicked. I think because of the Holiday, local day-trippers made up half of crazed crowd. They were all super nice but it created a strain on the already over booked facilities (getting a chair was impossible, a table for lunch, a drink, bathrooms were trashed etc..) However once Monday came (and it was just the sold-out hotel guests) it was quite nice. Truth is, people shouldn't belly ache about the food. Unless your at the Cuisineart resort in Anguilla, it's as good as carribean hotel food gets. NOW comes wacky problem #2, we were told during the check in process that \"NO HOTEL RESTAURANTS HAD AVAILIABLE RESERVATIONS THE ENTIRE 9 NIGHTS!!!) This WAS a recurring complaint on trip advisor. I envisioned a week of trying to \"forage for food\". The next day we went to the concierge who booked us in four of the nicer hotel restaurants at prime times (7:00 pmi sh) So what was with the previous day? And YUP, be prepared to pay, but not anymore than other comperable hotels in the islands. We were thrilled beacuse after Easter most resorts close all but one of their restaurants, we had 5 at night to choose from. The Coqui grill was really great, pretty fast (beachside for lunch) stay away from the funky-textured burger. Grouper snwich was fab. Loved the newest restaraunt by the beach villas (agua Luna) and ate there twice. Liked Palio too (and I'm Italian), Liked Shima the Asian place but not so much the entrees (fill up on sushi, rolls and fab appetizers like the ribs and spring rolls.) The Grill at the club house was ho-hum but a ncie change of venue. JUST ATAY AWAY FROM THE ALWAYS OPEN, NO RESERVATIONS NEEDED \"MARIBEL\" , even though it was the location of our \"complimentary meal\" ....it stunk. Ricks up the hill from the resort had a spectacular view but kinds medicocre food, Antojitos at the junction of the hotel turn off was great and cheap! Loved the lobby bar with latin dancing and mojitos, casino was small but did the job WACKY problem #3 Even though craps tables (my husband's FAV-orite game) are pictured over and over again on the web site and the promotions...there are none. On Saturday night they had 4 wanna-be players for every table spot (not so bad it probably saved us $200 in another nights lost wages). Additional tips: Davids cookies, I wanna buy that particular franchise bust from day until night, Great basketball courts, arcade for kids etc...Cleaning woman was getting stingy with towels and shampoo. There were 4 of us and she'd only leave 3 towels and a mini-bottle every other day. GOOD NEWS, call the service people they come right up with warm towles and a bag full o sundries (mouthwash, bath gel etc...) The heavenly bed thing is just another slightly higher-end hotel chain gimic. They all have their special named beds. It was plenty comfortable, but the bottom 10 inches of the mattressed were not covered with a sheet, day after day the maid literally \"short sheeted\" the bed, There is no fear of a lack of tip, because of the hefty built in housekeeping fee already charged. No bed bugs, BUT both my husband and son were eaten alive (and at the time they didn't know it) with some kind of No-se-um sand flies. The bites were the result of evenings out, and didn't show up until hours later, with the worst of the itching day two after being bitten. I know they weren't bedbugs as they were only and ankle/calve thing, and other my other kid and I weren't affected. Makes me wonder about the bed bugs...these were mighty nasty and are still itching my husband here at home, but they are definately not bed bugs. BRINGS LOTS OF BUG SPRAY AND CORTIZONE/ANTI ITCH CREAM. Gym was well equipted but crazy small and cramped. It must have been 87 degrees, you'd give into the heat before you'd wear out aerobically.

We were there with our two children 4 & 9 and the room was fine for all of us. Now the downside All of the on-site restaurants are priced out of site for dinner and none better then Outback. We went to all of them Palio, The Grille Room, Aqua Luna. Our average dinner bill with one bottle of wine was over $250.00 every night. Please keep in mind the kids are eating a hot dog or macaroni and cheese. I read some of the reviews before I started to write this and some of the reviewers state that the hotel is \"Only\" 45 minutes from the Airport or Old San Juan. Well, to me that is a pretty long drive. Since the hotel is in the middle of nowhere you pretty much feel like a prisoner of the resort. If it rains while you are down there or if you need a break from the pool, boy are you in trouble. To break up our trip we decided to take a cab ride to Old San Juan..$180.00 round trip. Would have rented a car for the day but the Avis on site had no cars available. All in all there are plenty of places you can spend $4,000 to $5,000 for a weeks vacation and it is my opinion this is not the place. Oh getting back to my above mentioned staffing issues. You could never find a waiter around the pool area and on top of that each restaurant was closed at least 2 nights while we were down there because they did not have the proper staffing levels. I know I may sound a little tough on this place but don't only take my opinion we ended up meeting about 7 couples while we were down there and they all had the same opinion except for the family that golfed. This is what I would call a one and done...but if you can get it for real cheap go for three or four days only.

Like most, I was hesitant after reading the reviews, but decided to credit the positive ones - especially of late. We were not disappointed. We did not have a single problem. We did check a cooler as carry on luggage (we filled it with our snorkel gear, etc.) which came in handy - as we shopped at the little corner store and purchased pop, liquor, lunch meat, etc. We had most lunches and breakfasts on our beautiful patio. We only ate at Marabella, a couple of dinners and one breakfast - but our food was great, service was perfect. (Rio Mar Burger and Cuban were excellent!) Our check in was uneventful, and although we were staying on Starpoints - the clerk moved us from a ground floor room, to one higher up so we'd have a better view. it was spectacular. The beach was great, the waves were fabuous for boogie boarding (you can buy one for $15 in the gift shop - the day we left, we gave it to a family who was just arriving and they were thrilled!) We spent two 1/2 days in the rainforest and it was great! If you hike down to the La Mina falls, wear your swimsuit - no place to change down there! No kidding about the Sierra Palm concession - the burgers there are to die for. There is a lot of rain, so when it is clear - head to the rainforest. We boogie boarded and snorkeld in the rain. Only when there was a big downpour did it slow us down! We also rented a car, great for running errands, getting around in the rainforest and finding a place to eat outside the hotel if you choose. (I disagree with all the raves about Rosa's in Fajardo - it was mediocre food, hard to find and expensive - but the rolls were good!) The highlight of our trip was the kayak trip through the mangrove swamp to the biolum bay - Mosquito Bay. You meet the guides and kayak right from the marina at Fajardo, it is an easy kayak trip and you get to jump in when you reach the middle of the bay. It is truly awe-inspiring to be swimming in a pitch black bay and be glowing green the whole time! Really - you don't want to miss this. Take the kids - our four year old loved it! The Westin Kids Club was great, staff there was kind and helpful. This is a typical Caribbean resort, drinks and food are expensive. Save where you can and don't sweat the rest...

Remember, bring sneakers because you will get very muddy! I would say if you have a car, contact the Carballi center directly rather than going through the hotel, who charges you $95 per person to rent the ATV's for 2.5 hours. The place is only a five min drive from the hotel and will give you a better deal if you go through them directly. I think they also do the bio bay tours for a much cheaper price (which we were unable to do because of the weather one night.) Old San Juan is only a 45 min drive from the hotel and is a must see for a one day excursion.

There was no cause for concern at all. We rented a car and it took us about 45 minutes to get to the hotel from San Juan Airport. We did not wait check in. I booked the room through Hotwire, got it for $128 a night, which was a steal. Because of this (I think) we did not get an ocean or beach front room, but got a room on the first floor over looking a road and some landscaping. (see picture)The room was clean and in good order (see pics of bed/bathroom- sort of!), however the \"heavenly\" bed wasn't very comfortable. It was rather hard. The concierges were very helpful with pre printed directions to El Yunque, the Fajardo ferry docks, the pier that the bio bay tours left out of (A MUST to do), and to Hacienda Caraballi (horseback riding and 4 wheelers). The concierge was also able to assist with an issue we had. My boyfriend came down with strep throat. We went to the Walgreen's and the laws are different in PR, the pharmacies can not take phoned in or faxed prescriptions. The pharmacist advised us that the Westin has a doctor on call that would be able to assist. The concierge phoned the doctor, he wrote a prescription ($50 for that), they went and picked it up and delivered it to our room within 2 hours. We were kind of anxious about what that bill would be, but it totalled $11 not including the fee for the doctor. Thought this was great, we got to lounge by the pool instead of running all over! The property was immaculately maintained and groomed. The beach sand was golden and there were shells for the picking. There were a lot of lounge chairs available both at the pool and the beach. My only suggestion is- if you plan on strolling the beach at night, wear bug spray! I was devoured by no-seeums. The bonfire was nice, and they have great rum runners there! ($8). The lobby has a great view of the ocean, and at night candles were lit to give it a nice ambiance. There was a piano player too, in one of the lounges on the first floor. I can't comment on the restaurants, we didn't dine at any of them. We did go to the Kiosks in Luqillo (#2 was YUM), Antonijito's which was at the corner of the street you turn on to get to the resort, and at the Brass Cactus. It's a chain restaurant, but it was close and open. Tex Mex food. We did go to Amigo's grocery store to grab breakfast foods- cereal, donuts, rum, etc. to avoid the $19 buffet. We did stop at David's one morning for a ham/cheese croissant, not too bad at $3.50 or so. We did not have to pay a resort fee, only $10/day parking. General recommendation- Bring a good street map. Many of the directions were measured in how many traffic lights to pass than by street names. We spent 3 days at the Westin then changed hotels to the Courtyard Miramar (free with reward points!) While there, we toured Old San Juan, El Morro, and ended up going to Culebra. It was planned earlier in the week, but the ferry broke leaving out of Fajardo. In San Juan, we ate at Senor Frogs, the Parrot place, it was really good- their house frozen drink is out of this world!, and at Picoteo's (Spanish tapas bar). We also dined at the Italian restaurant next to it the night before, because we didn't have reservations and it was pouring rain and we didn't want to search for somewhere else. We didn't have a bad meal there. Also, the pinchos that you can get road side are good too! Kebobs of chicken or pork (some stands had shrimp), with BBQ sauce and a slice of bread- $2 each. Also, had some batidas- fresh fruit blended with a splash of milk, some sugar and ice. Culebra was beautiful- Playa Flamenco has the cleanest water I've ever seen, and the beach is hand cleaned daily. They have vendors that have everything you need- beach chair rentals, ice, water, vendors that sell pinchos, empanadas and more, and it was all reasonable ($1 for a bottle of cold water, $2 pinchos, etc.) I definitely recommend taking the ferry out of Fajardo though. It was $2.50 per person each way and a 45 minute ride. We ended up on the Hi Speed Ferry out of Old San Juan for $68 per person RT, and an almost 2 hour ride on great big swells (8-10 ft). Not good when they pass out bags \"just in case\". They were used for sure! Dramamine is must if you do this.

It is clearly one of the top two resorts in Puerto Rico -- the other being the El Conquistador -- and I would actually rate the Rio Mar more highly based on location (45 minutes from San Juan, rather than an hour and a half for the El Conquistador) and the ease of getting to the beach (at El Conquistador, one must take a ferry out to an island, which is not at all convenient and requires more forethought than I am capable of on a vacation!). I am a frequent business and leisure traveler who often stays at Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons properties, and I would put the Westin just a slight notch below such resorts. Advantages: Notwithstanding some of the reviews below, the service was outstanding; the staff was uniformly friendly and helpful, and everything went extremely smoothly during our stay. The resort is also very well-kept and clean, especially for a Caribbean property; a huge army of workers is constantly picking up any loose wrapper, empty cup, or unused towel. The rooms are very nice, with generally good views in Oceanfront or Oceanside rooms. The beach is excellent -- a broad span of golden sand without other properties in sight, and perfect waves for those who like to body surf or boogie board. Each night there is a bonfire near the beach at which guests can roast marshmallows and, with friendly staff assistance, construct s'mores, which makes it unnecessary to order dessert at dinner! The two golf courses are very beautiful and well-kept, and surprisingly quick to get around on for a resort. My wife and I played twice at Rio Mar, and it took us about three hours each round. Both courses are quite expensive ($165 per round), but these greens fees are comparable to those on all of the island's other resort courses. (Note to golfers: I thought the River Course (designed by Greg Norman) was a much more interesting and challenging course than the Ocean Course (designed by Tom Fazio), and the ocean is not as prominent on the Ocean Course as the name might suggest.) Disadvantages: As others have noted, on-resort dining at the Rio Mar is an expensive proposition, though we thought the food was uniformly very good. Dinner entrees at Palio (the Italian place), Shimas (the Asian place) and the Grille Room were $27-40, and, while dinner entrees were cheaper at Club Coqui (a more casual outdoor area near the ocean), the menu was pretty limited. Marbella (the centrally located casual dining place looking out over the ocean) is actually a good dinner option, as it has a very extensive menu with something for adults and kids alike, and a nice atmosphere in the evening (while the room seems a little stark during the day for breakfast and lunch, the lights are dimmed at night for a very nice oceanfront atmosphere). While on-resort dining is expensive, the prices are comparable to and perhaps somewhat less than the El Conquistador down the road. Also, of course, one need not restrict oneself to the resort itself, as there are off-resort restaurants within 5 minutes of the resort in Rio Grande, Palmer, and Luquillo. I would strongly recommend visiting the cheaper and more authentic Puerto Rican places, such as Sandy's Seafood, King Seafood, and Victor's Seafood, all in Luquillo, or Don Pepe's, just outside the resort on Route 3. A must is to try a Mofongo, a traditional Puerto Rican dish consisting of a \"bowl\" made of fried mashed plantains filled with seafood or chicken in Creole sauce, which you can get at any of these places. All of the three aforementioned seafood places also have very inexpensive ($15-20) lobster dishes in which a surprisingly large amount of lobster meat is served in at least 10 different ways, from scampi-style, to Cantonese, to garlic sauce. I would say the principal disadvantage of the Rio Mar is that, like the El Conquistador, it sometimes has groups or conventions, which in my view takes away from the ambience of a place (too many loud alcohol-fueled greetings in the lobby, too many slightly overweight people in tank tops acting like they've never been to a nice hotel before). The groups seem to be more prevalent during the weekend than during the week, so if you are planning only a few day's stay, avoid Saturday and Sunday Tips: 1. Rent a car. You can do El Yunque for free and have the waterfalls to yourself instead of paying an exorbitant amount to take a bus there. We went at 8 in the morning and had the trails and waterfalls to ourselves for three hours. It also allows you to eat off-resort, which can save a bundle, and to go to San Juan and other cities for nothing. Indeed, the rental car virtually pays for itself vis-a-vis the Westin airport bus, which is $27.50 a person each way. 2. Go to a supermarket and buy breakfast stuff on the way into the resort from San Juan. There is free coffee in the room, and a muffin at the onsite coffee place is $3.50 or so. 3. Similarly, consider running out at lunch to buy Subway or BK for the kids rather than paying the high prices at Marbella or the pool. We figure we saved $300 during the week by doing this, which allowed us to focus our spending on alcohol rather than chicken fingers. 3. Definitely spend an afternoon in Old San Juan and have dinner there (we loved the Parrot Club). 4. Don't book excursions through the resort. We went on a Bioluminescent Bay boat trip to Vieques, and it would have cost $140 per peron, with no saving for kids, had we booked through the resort. By booking directly with Island Adventures in Fajardo by telephone, we spent for precisely the same trip, on the same boat, $50 less per adult and $60 less per kid, for a total savings for a family of four of $220.

I am sorry that they didn't have a good time. My husband and I spent our honeymoon at the Westin last year and had the time of our lives. We enjoyed every aspect of the hotel. The car trip there was a bit scary as we rented a car from the airport and drove in the worst rain storm I have ever experienced and it seemed like hours but once we arrived at our hotel we were pleasantly surprised. We waited in line for check-in maybe 10-15 minutes and they held our car and prepared our luggage for delivery to our room we were up-graded to a Jr. Suite with an oceanview and could not be happier. They also took my husband's golf clubs directly the the golf clubhouse and held them there the entire trip and even cleaned his shoes and clubs. He also did not recognize them when they brought them out for his golf round. He played twice and enjoyed each course. The room with huge with a two sick bathroom and large shower. We also had a view of the atrium of the hotel and beautiful grounds with the ocean in the backgroud. We then toured the hotel and found it to be huge. The first night there we enjoyed the most amazing sunset we had ever seen. The next day we enjoyed the breakfast buffet which was included in our package daily and every morning we looked forward to the delicous food and fresh fruit and different specials of the day. We did eat at the hotel a couple times. We enjoyed the sushi restraunt which I cannot remember the name and even went back a couple times for the most delicous dessert. (Cheesecake fried) Yum wish I had some now. We mostly ate off the property at Richie's which is right up the mountain from the Westin and has the most awesome view of the island. You can see everything and you feel on top of the world up there. On clear days you can see other islands. We ate there most every night and even made friends with our waiter. Lionel...if you go he's the best ask him what to do around the island for some local culture. We also visted the Rainforest and Old San Juan. The trip to Old San Juan was long with lots of traffic, def a whole day trip and it was a hot day but we were in Puerto Rico and we figured why not. The city is nice with alot of shopping but I wasn't there to shop but to enjoy the island of sun and sand and fun. The rainforest was also a great experience. It was everything I imagined and more. We swam in the falls and enjoyed the hike there and back. We also visited the another hotel the El Conquistador as that was an option when booking our honeymoon and were very glad we chose the Westin. The view is cliffside from the El Conquistador but the hotel was very crowded and not as warm and inviting as the Westin. Also the hotel was packed with people everywhere and felt run down and dirty and we didn't want to have to take the boat back and forth to access the beach everyday. At the Westin the beach is only a couple feet away from the pools (two pools and a waterslide at the Westin) and the hotel and you can access it anytime day or night. All in all we had the best honeymoon and actually thought about staying a few extra days and the staff was nothing but helpful with this request and offered us a great rate BUT we had to come back to reality.

After reading some of the reviews here we were expecting poor service, unkept grounds and rooms, and terrible food. We found the negeative comments we had read to be untrue, and exaggerated. We really had an amazing time. SERVICE: Front desk staff were very friendly and professional. Check in was efficient and easy, despite a bit of lineup. Housekeeping: Our maid was absolutely wondeful. Our Junior Ocean Suite was well kept, and clean. We asked for extra towels and bottled water which was provided each day without question. FOOD: Food was OK at the resort. Nothing super spectacular, but nothing atrocious either. GRILLE ROOM was medicore. Steak was not cooked to my specifications and the side of veggies/potatoes were somewhat bland. Waitstaff were very friendly though. PALIO...service was excellent. We had 2 waitstaff who took care of our every need. The manager even circulates on occassion to make sure you are happy with your meal. I had the veal marsala....highly recommend. Palio really was a great meal. MARBELLA: OK, but nothing fancy. A good place to grab an easy lunch. Prices OK. BREAKFAST: If you want to skip the $19 breakfast buffet why not try the following.....we brewed great Puerto Rican coffee in our room each morning, and I ventured to 'Davids Cookies' next to the casino and lobby....great muffins, bagels and croissants. Get the ham and cheese croissant for about $3, and head back to your room for a nice breakfast on the balcony. We also ordered room serice for breakfast....service charge and $2.50 delivery charge, but food came on time, was hot, and close to the price at the restaurants. The food at the Rio Mar is a little pricey, BUT this is a resort, AND you really have to consider that it does cost some extra $ to transport all the meats and produce to the resort. Overall we paid less for meals than we had planned for. Also, if you rent a car, there are an endless number of good restaurants within 15 minutes of the resort. We ate at Yoqui Delights in the rainforest (near km 10)...great burger, great views...$15.00 for both of us. Also at Luquillo beach (10 minute drive) there are 30 or more kiosks serving a variety of foods. I can't recall the name of the place we ate at (it started with P I think, and it was the second kiosk in...can't miss it) and had an amazing meal. We had the Mahi Mahi and flank steak (which was amazingly dressed and spiced). Delicious About $15 a plate. Be sure to try Lolita's just past Luquillo still on the main hwy#3. It's a mexican themed restautant. Extremely clean and modern inside and the food and service was excellent. We had the lunch special when we went...$5.50 a plate....cheap and great. Despite what others have said the Rio Mar is far from isolated if you have a car. Lots of great restuarants to the east (Luquillo and Fajarado), an excellent grocery store Amigo, about 10 minutes to the West. Lots of chain stores and fast food joints too, though we passed by these. DOWNSIDE: OK..it seems all positive so far, but we did have some issues. Before we even arrived my credit card had an unexplained change (many hundreds of dollars). This took many phone calls and almost 5 weeks to finally get a refund. Starwoods financial dept really is a mess, and very slow. The people at the hotel were very friendly about this whenever I called, but really couldn't get the job done. After reading reviews here I figured we were headed for disaster and a disappointing week. Finally got the refund, but it was $40 less than they took out. Hmmmm.....another call to the hotel. Here's where the hotel redeemed itself. I finally spoke to the VP Operations at the hotel, and within 15 minutes we had negotiated a compromise. He agreed to comp us dinner one night ($100) and upgraded our room from resort view to an Ocean Suite which was fantastic. CHEKOUT: They forgot to comp our meal, and actually charged us for the room upgrade that THEY gave us. Another administrative blunder. However, after a couple of minutes at the front desk, all was taken care of, along with an apology, and a further credit to our account for the misundersatnding. Very satisfying service, and response to our concerns. DAYTRIPS: Definitely head to El Yunque rainforest. Some beautiful hikes. I recommend La Mina trail which starts near Palo Colorado visitors center. About 45 minutes in and 45 minutes out (uphill!)...beautiful falls, and trail is pretty well maintained. Take your time though, the path can get a little slippery. Be sure to stop at Yoqui Delights for a great BBQ lunch (it's located 1/2 mile before Palo Colorado.) Horseback riding 15 minutes east of resort (they have 4-wheelers/ATV's as well). We didn't make it to the Bioluminescent Bay but were told it was amazing. 25 minute drive east toward Fajarado if you want.

I echo the others on the food -- it was totally mediocre and seriously overpriced. Their breakfast buffet is good, but lunch and dinners are pretty bad. The concierge has a bunch of menus for restaurants that are just taxi rides away. However -- things slow down and the taxis are hard to get after 8pm, so you cant take your leisurely time after a day on the beach, if you want to leave the property.

The strange system of unloading your bags from the car or the shuttle needlessly delays you at the registration after a tiring journey. The concierge charges you for any transportation he/she arranges such as a local restaurant and if you are not careful, the shuttle driver charges you again for the same service-a shameless act of double dipping. Scrutinize every item on your bill. This hotel is for rich folks who do not mind these attempts at stealing.

There were some very good things and some very bad things. We booked 2 adjoining club level ocean view rooms in October 2005 for a Febuary 2006 stay.

When I called to complain, I was told that they discontinued the club level service but they rebooked us in a similar rooms. Upon check-in, we were given adjoining rooms on the ground floor next to the elevators. I was furious and was told that they tried to accomodate us but the hotel was packed. (so much for booking 4 months in advance!!!) The food, as you can read in many of the other reviews, is sub-par and very expensive for what you are getting. The $19 per person breakfast buffet is just stealing your hard earned money. $80 for breakfast for a family of four adds up after a while. The asian themed restaurant is very bad. Service is very bad and the menu is a joke. If you are a sushi fan and eat at sushi restaurants often, you will die laughing at this menu. The $9 california roll could have come from our local supermarket. On the good side, the place is beautiful. The pools clean. The two hot tubs were fun. The nightly bonfire gave the place an enchanting smell. Housekeeping was very good. Our rooms were clean.The entire facility (except the casino) is very clean. The concierge is very professional and helpful. The best service at this hotel came from the concierge.

Things to keep in mind in reading my review: 1. we stayed during school mid-winter break when every other family in the country travels, and 2. my standard of excellence for a Caribbean resort is the Atlantis in the Bahamas, which i think is incredible for children and adults. We have also stayed at the Starfish Trelawny in Jamaica, which i found sub-par. We have not been to any of the top top hotels i.e. Ritz Carltons. ACCOMODATIONS We had an ocean view room which has a side view of the ocean. if you want full on, get ocean front. the room was fine and clean but my son was definitely allergic to something in there, he was coughing all night. if you take a shower around 5pm when everyone else is, having left the beach/pool, the water is warm, not hot. POOL/BEACH The pools are nice and well-maintained but i don't think they were heated. it was fine for my kids but i found it a bit cold. the beach is nice but the water's rough, definitely had to hold my kids' hands to wander in even a little bit. this is key: people get up at 6:45am going to save the key seats by the pool under the umbrellas. it got kind of ugly but if you don't go out early, you'll be far from the pool. around the perimeter of the pools are beautiful cabanas that are covered. if possible, see if you can reserve one in advance. if not, do it the second you get there with the towel clerk outside. the hot tub is the hottest i've ever felt which was fine once i got in but the kids found it too hot. CASINO One small room. Not a casino for real gamblers. FOOD OK, this is where it all falls down. I was assured on the day before I arrived that I could book my dinners once I got there but I was not able to get anything until the third night of my stay. There are three restaurants on the ground floor: Shimas, Palio, and Marbella that all SHARE THE SAME KITCHEN. and therefore, all the food that came out of it was equally MEDIOCRE and the selection extremely limited. And the prices are outrageous. It choked me to pay more for a steak at this hotel than at a top Manhattan restaurant. Marbella is the restaurant where you go if you have no reservations. this is where they have the breakfast buffet. the best thing about it was the fresh oranges, grapefruit, and papaya. everything else was standard fare. they would do well to offer a dinner and lunch buffet a la marketplace at the atlantis where you had a huge selection of foods and desserts. Shimas is the Asian restaurant. the only good thing about it was the fresh noodles they used in the low mein. but everything was sweet. that's not asian as far as i'm concerned. Palio is the upscale Italian joint. the food, was again mediocre. if you can, go to one of the restaurants off-site, which we didn't do because we were too lazy. We were told that Las Vegas is excellent and Don Pepe. SERVICE The service was fine. WE only had one waiter that was memorable. Jose at Shimas. SIGHTSEEING To visit El Yunque, which is the only thing close to the resort, is free, if you rent a car. if you go on the hotel tour, it's $38 per adult with a 10% discount for kids. the rental cars were sold out so we decided to take a cab. We got a 15 pax van and were told it would cost $200! When i went to the concierge she explained that only certain taxis were authorized to enter the rain forest. We got it down to $150 and paid the insane price because we were all packed up and ready to go and the kids were excited. in the end, it was a nice way to go because our driver was a local and took us to places the other tourists didn't go, like a pair of waterfalls that you have to hike a little to get to. the view from the tower is breathtaking. Despite everything I've written above, we had a good time because the kids enjoyed it so much. but if i had my choice, i'd go back to atlantis in a heartbeat. hope that's helpful.", "Date": "February 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New york", "Title": "\u201cIt looks like a Westin, but it doesn't feel like a Westin\u201d", "Author": "Jimibell", "ReviewID": "UR4477976", "Content": "Beware: If you are used to good service, avoid at all costs!

Poolside....hamburgers and boring sandwiches that come to you in a STYROFOAM BOX! And don't think that food is coming quickly, give yourself 1 to 2 hours to wait!!! Palios.....Bland salads with bottled dressing \"on the side\"! Greasy and yet somehow tasteless pasta, where a waiter actually recommended KORBEL as their so-called champagne!! I almost ran when I heard that! Shimas.... a joke all-around....over-cooked, again tastes like sauces are from a bottle, a menu that will bore you to tears, ridiculously poor service! Acqua Luna....decent food and fun, nice ambience but we did not know who our waiter was until he gave us the check! And the real treat is Marbella.......worst breakfast buffet I've ever seen....the \"hot\" food actually comes out COLD! and don't expect anyone to be sympathetic to your plight....you know, cold pancakes with corn syrup, un-ripe fruit, bland bagels, nobody even notices you have been seated, and when they do, they still ignore you....no, no, no management in the restaurant will be quite upset with you if you complain.....\"well, what was the problem today maam?!\" after complaining about these and many other \"detail\" type things, we received a room upgrade, which made our stay much more pleasant as the view was truly beautiful.....(and I hate to say it, but it was noisy) but the list is ever so long of things that ticked us off: rude management at the pool, unprofessional staff in general, late house-keeping service, embarrasingly bad wine lists, over-crowded, NOISY, NOISY, NOISY, loud-speakers at the pool along with really bad music, dirty public restrooms, rude hostesses, a shower that has low pressure and is often cold, the hotel has that club-med kind of cheezy, trying to be fancy but not quite cutting it feel (and the clientel to go with it)...if the Westin is going in this direction, they better cut the prices and change their name! these may sound like petty complaints but at those prices, I do not wish to feel like I am part of a cattle herd!! If you are looking for serene or elegant, don't bother. If you are looking for fine cuisine and excellent service, do not go to the Westin Rio Mar! If you are expecting to find your needs anticipated and to feel pampered and special, go elsewhere!! In essence, it seems their goal is to herd in as many people as possible and get them to spend as much as possible. It is a \"reactive-service\" oriented hotel, where complaining gets you upgrades, comped meals, etc but there is no apparent effort whatsoever to make things luxurious or wonderful for the guests without the guests specifically complaining about things! I would never return to the Westin Rio Mar and discerning guests are advised to avoid it if at all possible!

Don't think that you will stay here and leave the resort to walk around the town - there isn't really anything that you'd want to see you are so far away from everything. We booked several months in advance and paid a large sum to have a club room with breakfast, a balcony, and a ocean view room. ***WARNING TWO*** \"Ocean View\" rooms are not facing the ocean, they are perpendicular to the ocean. If you want parallel, book an \"Ocean Front\". We checked in, got to our room and had two small windows, no balcony, and a partial view of the ocean. We asked to be moved. We were told ok, but later. After two more trips to the front desk, we were told we couldn't be moved until the next day. After two more visits to the front desk the next day, we were finally moved, we were moved to a lesser room (1/2 the price) with two double beds (we had booked a king room), peeling paint, and hair in the bathroom. But, we finally had a balcony. Upon checkout, the hotel had charged us for breakfast, which was allegedly included in the rate, and shuttle service, which we had already paid for. ***Warning Three*** The buffet breakfast is $19.00 a person! We were then called a liar about breakfast being included in our room rate and asked to produce proof - on the spot. After threatening to raise a stink, the charges were removed. We checked out, took our cruise, and returned home to find all $200 worth of charges were put back on the bill. A month later, after about 5 e-mails and 3 phone calls, they were finally removed from my charge card. ***Warning Four*** Don't pre-pay for anything!!! We feel that the charges were removed at the hotel to shut me up and then re-charged once we left. At no point did the hotel attempt to make up for their booking error nor did they attempt to compensate us for having spent 1.5-2 hours at the front desk trying to fix the situation. The grounds of the hotel were very nice and if you get a good rate on the other rooms, go for it. But I wouldn't pay over $200 a night for this hotel and I certainly wouldn't book any services or inclusions through them directly. You'll get a huge hassle and headache. The food at the hotel was mediocre for the Marbella restaurant and poor for the Asian themed restaurant. These were the only two places we ate. Not what we espected for a Westin nor for a 4-star location. The restaurants are not Vegetarian friendly if you like good food. The staff ranged from incredibly friendly to incredibly cookie-cutter and uncaring. Poorly trained and with no apparant management, any problems are dealt with less than one expects at the price we paid for our room. Our problem with this hotel was not expecting something for nothing, but was expecting getting what we paid for and when we didn't get it, having a chorus of shoulders shrug at our concerns.

I read the reviews on tripadvisor before I booked, and thought-- hey this is a Westin- can it really be that bad? If you care about service- yes- it really is a hassle. I am a Starwood Gold member who has numerous stays at the Westins in San Fran, Vancouver, and Portland over the last two months. This hotel, however, is inferior compared to those properties. Although the grounds are very nice- nice beach, pools, etc, the service is consistently very poor. When we arrived we received a room with two double beds instead of our requested king- not a big deal to me (I can live with that)- the hotel says they can't guarantee king beds. Next, when we entered the lobby, there were 4 people arguing with a member of management about why they didn't have a room that night. There were three staff members behind the desk- apparently they weren't trained well enough so that they all needed to work together on one reservation even though there was a large line of people. After waiting in line with a few other angry customers, I was told that the key machine was out of service and that I couldn't get a key for my room. A staff member took us, as well as other guests up to their rooms and let us in with his master key. We were told they would bring a key up to us when the machine was fixed (estimated time 10 minutes). About 45 minutes later in our room, I went down to the front desk to inquire- all three staff members were standing around talking amongst themselves; they told me- \"oh sure we forgot to bring your key up.\" After calling the corporate Starwood preferred guest 1-800 number about the poor service, I did receive a call from hotel management offering a discount on the room, which was nice. The hotel was overbooked for the past two days, but again, many of the restaurants on-site were closed. Beware of the service at Shimas it was terrible. My husband requested tea four different times, and he was finally brought the tea at the end of the meal. We were charged for an extra drink, and when we told her she didn't bring it, she tried to argue with us. In fact, she never even checked on us during the entire meal. I overheard conversations at the conceirge desk, and in line at the front desk that others were not happy with the service. The couple in front of me at the conceirge desk had a few of their dinner reservations \"lost.\" I called down to the dive shop at 4:30 p.m. to see when they closed as I wanted to buy some merchandise for the next day. The staff member told me they closed at 6:00 p.m., when we went down at 5:25 p.m. they had already closed. It seems to be the \"norm\" here, that the service throughout the hotel-- front desk, shops, and restaurant staff-- is consistently poor. Our stay at this property was quite brief as we hiked the rainforest for one entire day, and the next day we were gone from 9-5 for a snorkel trip. It is surprising that even though we spent so little tiime here, we had so many problems. I've never had any problems at other Westins. One positive- they do have a firepit where they roast marshmallows and have smores (free of charge) from 7-10pm. The two staff members here were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

I recommend visiting the El Yunque forest as well as a local restaurant called the Bamboo Room (I think). The food was excellent, service was delightful and the entertainment was great. Probably easiest to make a list of pluses and minuses: Pluses: - Room was gorgeous, well appointed and clean. Room service was excellent and brought plenty of clean towels, non-allergic pillows and even a light bulb when we noticed one of the lamps was not working. We stayed in a regular garden view room one night and a suite the next two. - Staff was very friendly. - Beach was very nice, especially for swimming. - Pools/hot tubs were gorgeous and clean (definitely not dirty). - The food at the hotel restaurants, while expensive, was very good. - The golf course, although I did not play, was gorgeous. The grounds of this hotel are very well kept and reminded me of South Seas Plantation in Florida. Minuses: - We couldn't get the concierge to either help us in person or return phone calls. A request to make a dinner reservation was forgotten. I don't blame the staff but clearly there are not enough people employed in this capacity to cater to guest needs. - You MUST make reservations every night for dinner or else they'll make you wait until 10 - even if there are available tables. - It is next to impossible to get a drink at the Tiki Bar by the pool, and the waitress service takes forever. - I had a hard time getting drinks at the lobby bars as well. - There isn't much local nightlife. I went with a group of 20-somethings (singles and couples) and there really wasn't much to do aside from the casino. I do think however that it would be a great spot if you have kids. - This is definitely a convention hotel, so there were hoards of people from one company or another milling about the entire time we were there, and the restaurants were clogged with reservations for parties of 30 and 40. Not a lot of attention/sympathy given to individual guests. I probably won't return, but I didn't have nearly as bad an experience as some of the reviewers on this site.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Rio Mar\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4330421", "Content": "My husband and I and another couple just came back from a 5 night stay at the Westin Rio Mar. It was the best trip we have ever taken to Puerto Rico. We have stayed at the El San Juan, the Intercontinental and the Marriott - all in the San Juan area and there is no comparison to staying at the Rio. We were so apprehensive after reading many of the reviews, but I realize now that many of the people that have written reviews on this hotel are not accustomed to travel in the carribean and to many of the \"so so\" accommodations you find there. Having 80 degree weather year round and being on the water takes its toll on many resorts but I must say that this resort does their absolute best to keep the wear and tear to a minimum. The massiveness to the lobby area and relaxation areas around the lobby together with open staircases gives a feeling of carribean luxury. The staff was outstanding. They don't question anything you ask for. Although we could not be upgraded to an oceanview room, we found our rain forest view room to be peaceful and a nice change from the ocean view we normally get when we travel. I found being on my deck in the early morning viewing the mountains and total quietness to be quite wonderful. You must realize that this is a family oriented resort and we were told they only have 20% of their rooms with king size beds. I must say, that the families we saw were quite upscale and with a \"quiet pool\" and a \"family pool\" it didn't bother us a bit.....and the hotel was full and all restaurants were open. The service was perfect. Our thermostat didn't seem to work properly and by the time I left the front desk and went to my room, an engineer was knocking at my door to assist us. Each night clean towels were put in our room to replace the ones used in the morning. Also, at breakfast I asked for a small amount of milk to use for the coffee in our room rather than the powdered creamer....before I knew it, a water bottle of milk was handed to me, at no charge, which we refrigerated for our coffee. The staff was quick to give us drink coupons for rum drinks if we were inconvenienced at all for the slightest reason. I found only one truthful complaint out of all the reviews I read and that was the cushions on the chairs being damp or wet most of the time. The winter is their rainy season and you can get a downpour for about an hour being so close to the rainforest but then the sun is out shining again. This tends to keep the cushions wet. My second complaint is that the casino leaves something to be desired if you enjoy gambling...Half the machines are inoperable but I don't think this is a big concern because 75% of the people in the casino are locals not guests. I enjoy playing the machines rather than doing the bar thing at night so I would have liked a bit more variety but we visited the other 2 casinos when we rented the car. Plus, I never plan on big time gambling in the carribbean...I save that for Vegas for Atlantic City. The main thing we found impressive is that no one was looking for a \"handout\". At other resorts, there are beach personnel constantly wanting to set up your chairs and get your towels or re-arrange your chairs all for a tip of course. Being a private 500 acre resort there was no one to bother to want to braid your hair or sell you trinkets. No one trying to sell a time share or sell you a boat ride or tour. You get absolute privacy. We chose the transfers with our tour operator for $100 and then rented a car for the middle 2 days at the Avis desk right at the hotel for apprx. $120 for the two days. The ride to and from the airport was about 45 minutes. We had no trouble finding the rain forest, or the other two resorts to check them out...and frankly I am so glad we didn't pick Paridisus or the El conquistador. When we visited these places to go to the casinos, all we saw were jitneys running people all over. All in all it was the most enjoyable trip we have taken and I am ready to book again as soon as I see a good special come around. If anyone has any questions just post your questions and we will be more than happy to respond....

This location was recommended by an event planner who works with my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company, so we went ahead with our travels. The hotel was about an hour drive from the San Juan airport by rental car. We were given an ocean view room on the third floor, which also acts as the main level of the common areas. The room was spacious and clean, comparing well with rooms we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently occupied in the Times Square and Seattle Westins. I usually am not a fan of being stuck in a resort with only the location\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants to choose from. But, the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four main dining areas were a nice surprise during our trip, and I looked forward to returning to each. You need to get reservations for these, so plan out your stay with consideration of the days each are open. Though the restaurants may have been half full, I heard the hostess tell guests that they were booked. The first evening we dined at the Grille Room. The crab cakes were so delicious; I ordered a second before my filet arrived. My wife was happy with her meal, although I thought her lobster was a bit overcooked. The second night we ate at Palio, and had a wonderful bottle of Italian wine recommended to us by our waiter. The linguine and clams in garlic olive oil was a great find. Later, we tried Shimas, and though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a big sushi person, the fare was very nice. We later visited both the Grille and Palio again and were not disappointed. Our only lunch at the resort was at the Pub near one of the golf courses. Like the other sites, the service was great and our waitress had nice recommendations for us. The prices were a few dollars higher than we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accustomed to at home, but are typical for any vacation destination. We ventured to the Old San Juan shopping areas during our first full day in Puerto Rico. While getting a rental car is preferred, the pot holes and liberal driving customs do take a bit getting used to. I hit a chunk of loose asphalt on the freeway and won the chance at changing a flat tire on the shoulder of the freeway near the airport. Also, it is wise to count to three when the traffic light turns green before hitting the gas. San Juan is a cruise ship port and as such, is home to many tourist souvenir shops. One which was a bit better was the Puerto Rico Arts and Craft shop, offering the wares of many local artists. On another day we took a visit to the rain forest, which is just across the highway from the Rio Mar. While visiting the Rain Forest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Visitors center wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessary, it did give us a map which pointed out the area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hiking trails. The hike to the waterfalls and pools was very refreshing. We also stopped at the small outdoor restaurant located near the 11 km sign and enjoyed the barbequed hamburgers covered with the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secret sauce. We took a trip to the El Conquistador hotel located 30 minutes east of Rio Mar. It has a nice hill-side location and we enjoyed taking the funicular down the cliffs to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small harbor and harbor bar. I noticed that several shops on the outer wing of the hotel had a musty smell from water exposure. During the final day of our trip we had planned to hang out by the pool, but a pending storm changed our plans to visit the El Morro fort in San Juan. While we got wet, it was a very interesting trip in which we learned more about Puerto Rico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early history. Unfortunately, the storm wiped out our plans to visit the bio-luminescent bay area of Fajardo later that evening. I was very pleased with the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to make our trip enjoyable. The few shops in the hotel were very nice. I did try out the casino and while a craps table wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t present, I enjoyed my time at the blackjack tables. There are many pleasant areas to have a drink and socialize in the bar and outside most of the restaurants. The pool was better than average, even though my wife had to flee from a native iguana. The beach looks very inviting from the pool bar, but the run-off from the rain forest churns up some of the beach sediments making the waters a bit murky.

First, the positives: the staff were sweet as sugar, and though we didn't have any special needs or requests, I got the sense that we would have been accommodated if we had. Our room, a corner \"Ocean Suite\" which was really more just a large guest room, was *beautiful* and exceptionally large, clean, and decorated in a modern, comfortable, understated way. We didn't have much of an ocean view - just a glimpse - but we got over that quickly because the room itself was so nice. The grounds are very well-kept and the two pools are large and clean. The Mandara Spa was really wonderful; I had a massage and a Ginger-Lime Body Scrub, and both were awesome! I've been to many spas, and this one, while not massive like the Golden Door at the Conquistador (it has 12 rooms) was lovely, intimate, and super-relaxing. Now the negatives. The main complaint I personally had was a small one, but important to me: the casino had no craps table. It's the only game I like to play (and I really love it!) so the fact that the Westin goes out of its way to advertise craps on literally every single ad for their casino and on their web site, when they actually don't even have one table, was a huge disappointment. The beach at the Westin isn't the greatest; the sand is brown and coarse, not fine and white. We spend a lot of time in Vieques, PR and are spoiled by the beaches with powdered-sugar sand. The restaurant situation was not great; as many others have stated here, one night there were only two restaurants open for dinner, while another night there were four. The one place that's always open, Marbella, is pleasant enough for breakfast or lunch, but we like to get a little dressy and enjoy a nice dinner out; Marbella just doesn't really cut it. The hotel seemed only about 25-30% full, so maybe that was why they chose not to open all restaurants every night. Still, it was disappointing and we ordered room service 2 of our 3 nights. Palio was just slightly above-average Italian food, and way overpriced, though I do expect that at a resort in the Caribbean. All in all, the Westin Rio Mar is a very nice resort.

With that being said we just returned from the Westin after a 4 day stay and would recommend this resort. Sure, there are things that are not great, but overall it is a very nice resort. Rooms: We had a ocean view on the 6th floor (Starwood floor). The halls leading to the room were quite musty and outdated (floors also need to be vacummed). The room itself could use some updating, but we were not disappointed. It was spacious, had a nice balcony and was relatively quiet (with the exception with a few door slams). The maid service was great - no complaints. Grounds: The interior of the hotel is very nice. The lobby (which has free wi-fi) was spacious, inviting and was decorated very nicely for the holidays. The pool area was very good and we had no problems getting a seat. They have a quiet pool and a family pool that are both relaiively clean and spacious. Some of the chairs were wet (guess what? - it rains in the Caribbean) so check the lounge before you plant yourself. The beach seemed nice (we spend most of our time at the pool) but the sand is not very pretty (brownish) and the waves are rough. Restaurants: The biggest complaint is here, but keep in mind the hotel was not packed so a few were closed. We went to the Golf Club to eat at the Grille Room and the Iguana Pub (you must take a shuttle there - 5 minute ride - runs very often). The food was ok and the ambiance somewhat limited. The Grille Room was pricey (but what do you expect at a resort?) On Friday night Shimas opened up and we had an oustanding meal and as well as service. The Tiki Bar by the pool was open for lunch (limited menu), but was right on the ocean. Several other restaurants were closed but they should open in the high season when the hotel is booked fully. We did not venture off the gounds to eat, but from what we saw and heard, nothing of great consequence was very close. Fitness Center: Small but has everything that one needs (6 treadmills with TVs, weights, some machines). Towels and water are available. Other Observations and Tips: * Rent a Car! - there is an airport shuttle, but we heard of people who took cabs for $75. Also, to leave the grounds a cab will run you $15 just to get to the gate. The car came in handy for the El Yunque forest. WARNING! - Beware of the local drivers - they are nuts. Signaling does not exist and cars pop out of nowhere. Roads are not easy to figure out. Popping in and out of highway 3 was extremely challenging. * El Yunque was well worth it and 15 minutes from the resort. Wear sneakers as it can be slippery when wet. Do NOT eat at the Visitor's Center. We had nachos and pizza and was one of the top 3 worse meals we ever had. HOWEVER, DO stop by the Sierra Palm Food Concession Picnic Area and get yourself a burger. There's a local that BBQ's up burgers and it was by far the best tasting burger we ever had!! * Casino was very small * Golf course looked great (did not play), but is appeared to be empty everyday.", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan USA", "Title": "\u201cSome good, some bad\u201d", "Author": "barbaradixon", "ReviewID": "UR4222307", "Content": "The Westin is a top notch hotel, and this hotel is no exception.

But some of the good and the bad ... the casino is small, very dirty, and some of the machines are broken, or keep breaking down with your money in them. The grounds are lovely, but nothing spectacular. They have two swim pools, and both are large. But they are not heated, and they were so cold no one but kids would use them. All the adults complained. They do have plenty of pool lounges, and yes they are wet quite often because it rains a lot. Just take the pad off, and use the wicker chair with a towel. And they are very generous with towels. No limit to how many you want, and they are nice large thick ones too. Our room rate included the buffet breakfast. It was good, with a nice selection, but it cost $42.50 for two. That is just absurd. Since it was included we ate there every morning, but I would never spend that kind of money for an ordinary breakfast. We had a rental car, so each evening we went out. We visited most of the casinos, all of them better than the Westin, we ate in local Puerto Rico restaurants, so didn't try any of the places within the Westin complex. But heard that you will spend an easy $100 for dinner. Because it's Christmas season they had the hotel decorated with just wonderful Christmas decorations and greenery. Much nicer than anyplace I've seen. Traffic on the main road from airport is just awful. It took us over 2 hrs to get to the hotel. And that is normal, to go just 25 miles. Staff at the hotel are way above the norm. We did not encounter anyone that could be called average. They go out of the way to make sure you have a great hotel experience. Our room was freshened twice a day, neverhad that before. Major complaint with parking that cost $10/day. I feel if staying at a hotel parking should be included. It was an underground garage, and very convenient for us. The cost is added to your final bill, you get a parking ticket each time you pull in and out. If anyone wants to contact me for specific information I'll be glad to answer. basha417@yahoo.com. Overall - I don't think this resort is worth the price, and I don't think Puerto Rico is much of a tourist destination. Heavy traffic, expensive, lots of rain, everything spaced pretty far so a car is almost a necessity, beaches are pretty but water is very rough on north side of island (where San JUan and most hotels are located).

We were charged 10 dollars per day to park the car and it was a 10 minute walk from the room to the car each time we used it. We loved the decorations and art in the hotel . The grounds were absolutly beautiful and pools very clean but I will have to agree the seat around the pool were always wet. Our room was on the bottom floor facing the garden and that was ok because we could hear the frogs at night and the ocean was not that beautiful green color it was brown. At night I sleep like a baby from the sound of the tree frogs. The rooms were very clean and all the workers make you feel very special. We loved the breakfast buffet it was a great deal and it had a nice selection. However we did not like the dinner at Marabela it tasted like it was prepared at convience store and we did talk to the manager about it and he did not charge us for one of the items that we did not eat. The hotel advertised that it had 4 or 5 resturants do not beleive this one night only Marabellas was open and we could not get reservations in teh Italian resturant that only had 5 tables with customers. I think they were short staffed. I would recomend going to the resturant down the street for local food ( AntoJitos). It was very clean good food and a fare price but lacked mood. There is not too many resturants other than Mc Donalds and Burger King and other fast food places to eat outside the hotel. The beach was nice but I would only give it a 7. One night we gambled in the casino and lost but only 10 dollars I am not into gambling or drinking so they did not make much money off of me. My partner did have a couple drinks that cost 14 dollars for just two and that is about all we spent on that. Lunch was good for the price and quility we had burgers and salads just your standard meal nothing special. We did go to the rain forest and that was the highlight of Peurto Rico. One day we drove into Old San Jaun and had a 80 dollar lunch that should have only cost 40 dollars in my opinion. The drive into San Juan was very slow and I would never do it again.The city did not really have much to offer in the arts mostly cheap junk stores with beautiful streets and buildings and no where to park except for a 5 dollar per hour parking garage.

Our Room: Our room was an ocean front room and the view of the hotel pool and the ocean beyond was absolutely stunning.We had a mini refrigerator and a microwave in room just as we requested. The room was also kept quite clean and we had no trouble with the Maid Service (as they called it). And yes, the beds are heavenly!! The Hotel: The hotel property itself is very beautiful just like in the pictures, if not more ! They have 2 pools and 2 hot-tubs. Just beyond the pool area is the beach. The beach is positively gorgeous!! With a view of hammocks and beach chairs nestled among several coconut palms and the blue ocean stretching out before you, it is postcard perfect. It is also very clean and there is almost always a life guard present during the day. On the beach, there are facilities to rent surfboards, tubes, kayaks jet skis etc. Very convenient. In the afternoons , the Tiki Bar right by the beach is open and is perfect to grab a snack and a drink and head back to the pool/beach. We didn't spend much time in the pool but the hot tubs were very relaxing. Restaurants: All the restaurants were open during our stay. They briefly closed the Marbella for a couple days for renovation before the Thanksgiving dinner buffet but the Palio was made available for the breakfast buffet for those 2 days. The breakfast was included in our package and we would have a heavy b'fast each morning and would end up doing something real light for lunch.Yes, the food quality is very average and it is pricey. We read this in the reviews and hence,took some non-perishable food with us. We liked the Grille Room the best. It would have been really nice if they had a Puerto Rican cuisine restaurant on site! Carlos, the Food and Beverage Manager, is an asset to the Westin! He was very hospitable and accomodating and a \"must-mention\" in our review!! We didn't not see any issues with slow service and everyone was very friendly too! Getting Around: We didn't rent a car as we didn't want to deal with driving and directions esp. since we don't know Spanish. We did about 3 tours from the hotel- Catamaran/Snorkelling, El Yunque Rain Forest and the Bacardi/Old Town San Juan tours. We felt that though they are expensive, it was worth the luxury of being picked up and dropped off at the hotel door without dealing with the terrible traffic.The concierges, Otto and Pebbles, organized our tours and were very helpful and informative. Our tour guides, Harry and Manuel were excellent! Misc: Over the holiday weekend, the hotel did get a LOT busier! The check in lines were LONG and the pool area got much busier and noisier. But the service remained just as good and as a credit to the hotel, they added activites such as live music by the pool and opened up some more hot dog etc stalls in the pool/beach area. Everywhere on the property, you can charge all purchases to your account/room and that gives you an \"all inclusive vacation experience\".We liked the fact that we didn't have to deal with carrying our wallets around all the time. One bad experience we had was that, we went to the Iguana Pub for lunch and the shuttle never came to pick us up to take us back to the hotel! The golf course personnel gave us a ride back in a golf cart! The golf course is beautiful. We didn't play a round but enjoyed taking photos of the lovely greens! Yes, there isn't a whole lot to do at the hotel in terms of activities in the evening if you don't want to lounge or gamble. Well , that was our experience at the Westin and I hope this helps make your decision of where to stay a little easier! If we went back to Puerto Rico again, we would stay here in a heartbeat!", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Vernon, New York", "Title": "\u201cLittle trip gone bad\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4147122", "Content": "I've been to Puerto Rico quite a few times and have all ways stayed in San Juan. Unfortunately, my friends and I decided to go somewhere different and boy did we regret it. First of all, if you want to stay in an area where there is plenty of night life, you shouldn't be at any hotel in Rio Grande. Every single local business is closed at around 6pm, which means if you didn't rent a car you would be stuck in the hotel in the evenings. Check In: It was horrible, the hotel overbooked due to at least three major business conferences. Those of us who weren't apart of it were told we had to wait for a room for at least an hour. Those of us who wanted an explanation (like me) were either given dinner or cocktail vouchers as an apology. We waited over a hour and half, and finally they gave us a room overlooking the hotel restaurant's exhaust fumes and roof, even when I had reserved an ocean view. It Was a Fortress: The hotel is a gated fortress where if you wanted to walk about the town, you would need to take a bus just to get out of the resort. Don't get me wrong the grounds are very well kept and you can hear the constant song of the native Coqui's. However, nothing is within walking distance. Good thing we rented a car and drove half and hour every day to San Juan for tourist fun. In the End: In the end, I spoke with the day manager and I expressed how unsat this hotel was and that I would never comeback. He was very nice and and apologetic. He even gave me a nice discount which helped the overall bill shrink significantly.", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRio Mar...nice pool and beach but wouldn't do it again...\u201d", "Author": "shelleyr25", "ReviewID": "UR4147034", "Content": "Stayed at the Rio Mar from 11/22-26 (Thanksgiving week) and found similar problems as had previously been posted in other reviews. To be kind, I will start with the positives. Check-in went smooth on the Tuesday before the holiday but I did see long lines on Wednesday and Thursday. Our room (6126-Oceanview)was kept clean and housekeeping could always be found in the hallway if we needed extra towels etc.. Yes, the beach and pool areas were very nice. Although it was a holiday weekend there seemed to be plenty of lounges available (although the immediate poolside chaises had belongings on them by 8am), I did see staff adding more chaises later in the day so that nobody was without a place to sit. The pool area is very pretty and my kids had a blast on the water slide. There was some construction going on which was a bit annoying (large hoses stretched across the entry area to the beach on Tuesday and Wednesday) they did take a break for the holiday weekend. The beach was nice with plenty of lounges. Because it was a holiday week the hotel was booked solid and with the exception of Tuesday night, all the restaurants were open. There seemed to be plenty of staff whom were all friendly and helpful. All the restaurants have a \"kids club\" menu which was great for my picky kids. Now, to my issues...the major one being the food. We ate at Shimas(Asian), Palio(Italian) and the Grill Room/Iguana Pub on the golf course. Shimas was by far the best with the sushi being what I am used to eating at home for about the same price. The biggest let down was Palio...very limited menu with high prices for sub-quality food. I am from the NY area and am accustomed to paying a bit more when I am out to eat but for that I expect to get a good meal. At the Rio Mar I did not. Not for a single meal(other than the sushi) did I feel that it was worth the money that they were charging. We never made it to the buffet breakfast because we do not generally eat a large breakfast and for $18 a person it would not have been worth it. We also did not go to the buffet Thanksgiving meal because at $45/adult and $22/child, I could just not justify spending the money since by Thursday I had already learned enough to know that it just wouldn't be worth it. The restaurants on the golf course did have a bit more of a selection but the calamari looked like frozen onion rings and my $30 roast duck tasted like rubber. The saving grace (stretching it) was the David's Cookie bar in the lobby. It served coffee, pastries, ice cream and snacks. That was where we had breakfast in the morning and ice cream for the kids at night. Once again, the prices were incredibly inflated ($3 for a large coffee!!). The rooms were so-so..although as I stated before, they were kept clean but are in severe need of updating. The bathrooms are out of the 80's and the brown wooden furniture looks like it belongs in a childs room. The public bathrooms in the lobby had already been updated and were in much better shape although it seemed that out of all the stalls only one or two in each bathroom had working locks. Not sure why that problem hasnt been addressed yet because it was truly annoying. A few tips if you will be traveling there: rent a car and use the self-park, bring snacks to eat poolside, dont limit yourself to onsite dining you will be greatly disappointed, bring bug spray and use it all the time, make sure to go to the rainforest in your car without a tour..its free!! Despite the problems, we did have a nice time and met many nice people. The kids had a great time at the pool and beach and really loved the iguana feeding every morning at 11 am. We did have alot of clouds and rain but the kids activity director had many things planned to keep the kids busy. I would not return to the Rio Mar strictly due to my issues with the dining. I enjoy quality food and dont like to feel that I am being ripped off each time I eat a meal. Hope you found this review helpful.

Of course, as mentioned, the Black Bean Soup is actually very good, as is the Churassco. The beach is actually quite good, very pretty with plenty of towels and nice lounge chairs. The gym is not good, and super-hot. Plus, the blasing electronica makes working out a possible panic attack. The captive birds as lobby decor are quite depressing, and we were dissapointed to find a Starwood property embracing animal cruelty.

So I will keep this short by saying ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING s/he said is true and far from nitpicky. A couple of additions: 1) I too am a Starwood member. When I arrived I asked for a room on the preferred floor but was told none were available. Instead we were given a room that was nothing short of disgusting...it smelled like a sewer and the bathroom was covered in mold. Upon complaining to the front desk, we were promptly moved to a cleaner, mold and odor free room...surprisingly on the preferred Starwood floor. It turns out the hotel was less than 20% full. Why were not given such a room in the first place is a mystery, and the fact that they had rooms in such bad shape is shocking for a '4-star' hotel. 2) If you rent a car, which is almost a must staying at the Westin, be forewarned that driving in Puerto Rico can be a nightmare. Even the locals told us it is difficult to get around unless you're familiar with the area. We wasted far too much time lost and we had 'the most detailed map' available. Street names are absent or change frequently, or are not found on maps.

My husband and I and our now 8 yr old daughter have stayed at the Westin Rio Mar for the last 2 years in February/March. We stay at the Westin for 6 nights and then go down to the Ritz Carlton in San Juan for the last 3 nights. (The Ritz is also spectacular!!!) We've met some great families here and our daughter loves it every time. You are not going to find a better beach or location!!! This is definitely a great family place to be. People in other reviews have complained about the lack of night life but his has not been an issue with us. We still manage to be walking around and having with our daughter and having fun at 10 pm!! We've driven over and visited the Wyndam El Conquistador just to look at it. Yes it is certainly grand and massive but I certainly did not feel like I was missing out on anything at the Westin....especially having to take a ferry everytime you wanted to go to the beach!! The beach and water at the Westin is beautiful and you will be hard pressed to find a better one any where this side of the island. People who complain that the sand isn't white better get over it cause there are no white sand beaches this side of the island starting as far down as San Juan!! It still feels like velvet and they \"comb\" it every morning. The water and waves are great for swimming. Once it was pretty rough due to the winds but even then it was still fine for swimming. FOOD- Why does everyone act so surprised at the cost of food and drinks? Of course theyre going to be more than what you're use to paying in your local hometown! But you did to chose to vacation at a nice hotel and the nicer the hotel the more you'll pay. The prices are no higher at the Westin than they are at any other 4 star hotel. Your on vacation, just forget all the nickel and diming and enjoy yourself!!!! There will be plenty of fine food to be found here. You can also go to the local resteraunts which are great too! The bartenders in the lobby bar have great recommendations for where to go. ROOMS - Our rooms have been wonderful, and believe me, I'm a snob when it comes to hotel rooms!! Only on our first visit did we experience a problem with our room and it was due to the noise. We had a mountain view ( which is beautiful too) but our room was directly over the front entrance so we had to listen to the hotel shuttle and all the cars and people coming and going all the time. We talked to the Manager and they moved us the next day without any problems to a different room and it was great. Housekeeping was always great and friendly and the rooms and bathrooms were great with hairdryers etc. And the Heavenly Beds, well they are really heavenly!! RENT A CAR!!!!! Rent one at the airport upon arriving and keep it for the trip. You will save an exorbitant amount of money doing it this way. Getting one at the hotel which run around $60 for a day and you still need to pay for transportation to and from the airport. We rented from Thrifty for a week and it was only $180!!!! Getting to the hotel and getting around is actually very easy. The worst thing is the traffic sometimes. There is a $5 daily parking fee at the hotel, but well worth it....come and go as you please. There are gas stations really close to the hotel. Great resteraunts just a short drive away from the hotel and on the way up to the Rain Forest which is literally across the street!! It is impossible to please everyone but I will tell you this is a wonderful hotel!!!!

The Good ======= Nearly all of the frontline staff was great. They went out of their way to attempt to make up for the lack of open facilities. While some weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly efficient, they really tried hard and had a good attitude.

The Bad ===== Of the eight restaurants advertised at this property, only three were open regularly during our stay. Of these three, two required a shuttle bus ride to the golf club, making it inconvenient to grab a quick bite. If you want to eat off the property, it will cost you $15 each way to any of the nearby restaurants. The lack of eating choices was our single biggest complaint about this resort. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious that they do their best to keep you ON the property, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only fair they provide guests with a decent selection of places to eat or give guests advance notice of what to expect. Our housekeeping service was pretty spotty. We stayed here for 8 nights, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get maid service for a two day period (midway through our stay) until we called service express. It was also clear that the staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change our sheets when we placed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153change our sheets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd placard on the bed. Musty hallways and very thin walls -- We jokingly tried to guess what our neighbors were going to order for breakfast each morning because we knew we would hear them the second they discussed it. The property was also renovating some rooms, so between about 9-5, there was constant banging/drilling/hammering coming from somewhere or other. The Average ======== The Casino was nice for a diversion. However, there were not very many table games, and the odds weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very favorable for the player. For example, at blackjack, you could only double on 9, 10, & 11, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surrender, etc. Even though advertisements for the Casino prominently display people playing craps, we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a craps table anywhere. While playing, you will *not* get a drink if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re polite, period. Table limits were low, though, and we always were able to find a $5 table when we looked for one. The food was unspectacular, even at Palio, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flagship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurant. As one might expect, the quality of the food does not match its price. If you have kids, I think this property is for you. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for peace / quiet / romance, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find it here. For example, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quiet pool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (polite Westin-speak for \"no kids\") always had 3-4 children running around/screaming, etc. Parents were either oblivious to or ignored the Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effort to set aside an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area.

We are in our mid 40s/early 50s and have vacationed from bargain basement to first class. We both enjoyed the Westin very much with some definite caveats. As others have said, the resort was at very low occupancy, so many of the usual amenities were not available. We had booked an oceanfront room in the Club level using a code that was supposed to have been expired, but which the computer allowed us to get anyway. At check-in we were upgraded to a junior suite. I don't know if this was due to being Starwood Preferred guests or because we had noted that it was our anniversary on our reservation. Also at check-in, we were informed that due to the low occupancy, the Royal Beach Club amenities were not being offered. Instead, we were offered free breakfast buffet at Mirabella'a and $15.00/night from the mini-bar. Not a bad deal as the breakfast for two was $37+tip. This is also when we found out that only Mirabella's and the Grill Room Restaurant were open. This was not too disappointing, as we had planned to eat outside of the restaurant most of the time anyway. Our room was very spacious, and the heavenly bed was indeed heavenly. Some of the furniture had a bit of wear, but overall it was quite nice. Being on the 7th floor, our balcony had no covering so we didn't get to use it too much during our first day and a half of rain. The showers could use a bit of upgrading, and the \"turbo\" flush toilets were a little lacking in the flush department. The only other complaint with the room was that it seemed that part of the HVAC unit was on the roof above our room and we could hear the blowers all the time. I just tried to pretend it was the sound of the ocean! The staff (front desk, concierge, restaurant, spa, etc) was all very friendly, efficient and helpful. The grounds are absolutely lovely even though there was a bit of construction going on around the pool and the fountain in the quiet pool didn't work most of the time we were there. We both had the Swedish massage at the Mandara spa. It wasn't the best massage I've ever had, but it helped pass a rainy day. Note that they added a \"service charge including gratuity\" to our bill. We also booked a catamaran snorkeling trip through the dive center. It would have been cheaper to drive over to Fajardo and book our own trip, but at that point in our trip, we were happy to let someone else do the driving and logistics. We ended up going out with Travelers. It was a good time. At check-out, they deducted all of the Mirabella breakfast charges and mini-bar charges from our trip. When we got home, I saw that they had been billed to our AMEX. I called the Westin and they said it would be corrected, but I'm still waiting to see the charge removed.

Very good deal- $ 199 including all taxes, resort fees and breakfast. When we arrived we were supposed to recieve an upgrade if it was available and we were Starwood preferred guest members. The first room we were given was a resort view- there were chunks of plaster ceiling coming down in the bathroom- I am not kidding- a huge section of ceiling was falling down right over the toilet. My husband went down to the desk and we were immediately given a room on the Starwood Preferred guest floor with a beautful ocean view. We were very pleased- my only question is why weren't we given this room to start with??? The hotel was definitely NOT full. We arrived on Saturday night. We ate dinner at that restaurant just as you drive up the hill to the Westin... Antoniopuertoiquenio- or something like that. It was very good- very nice atmosphere, very pretty and prices were very reasonable. Dinner with wine was under $ 50 for the two of us. We walked around the Westin and found that there were only two restaurants open even if we had chosen to have dinner there. Palio and Marabella. The next day- we had breakfast at the buffet in Marabella- it was included in our package- and that was almost the best part of the entire vacation. That breakfast buffet was really amazing!!! Unfortunately it was raining lightly- but we had a car and we hiked in the rain forest anyway.( the hike to the cloud forest- Mt. Britton trail- truly beautiful ) That night, there was nothing open for dinner in the Westin except for Marabella- which had an almost coffee shop atmosphere for dinner. We met a couple who was celebrating an anniversery- and the hotel was sending them to the El Conquistador for dinner in their shuttle bus. I understand that the hotel was only 30 % occupied that night- but its still not fair to the guests who booked a resort expecting 6 restaurants- only to find a single \" family diner\" experience as their only dining option. Some kind of piano bar- or nightly music would have really been nice- there was NOTHING at night!!! The hotel really seemed to cut back on its services due to the low occupancy. We tried to rent bicycles only to find out that the hotel only had one bike - they said all the other ones had been stolen and that they did not plan on replacing them yet. I felt like I should have been warned when I made my reservations not to expect too much from the hotel. That is my only complaint about the Westin. Although it rained almost the entire time that I was there, I went for a run one morning and saw that the hotel grounds are beautiful. The gym was very well equipped. All the treadmills and elipticals had individual TV screens- they had water bottles and energy bars complementary in the gym. The pools were really pretty the concierge was very imformative. I stayed at the El Conquistador a few years ago and like the Westin better- its closer to San Juan, and not as huge. It also didn't have that same \" Nickle and Dime- take advantage feeling\" that I got at the El Conquistador. The staff also seemed much more attentive. If you go, defintely rent a car, its easy to get to and gives you so many more options in case of bad weather.

We travel quite alot in the Caribbean. This was our first time in Puerto Rico. I looked at the reviews after I had booked the Westin and frankly, I was a little scared. However, I don't think the prior reviews did it justice. We arranged with the hotel to have the shuttle pick us up at the airport. The greeter was waiting for us and was extremely friendly. The shuttle driver acted as our tour guide to the hotel, again extremely friendly. As a matter of fact, everyone from the front desk staff to the waiters and baggage porters could not have been friendlier. The hotel grounds were immaculate. The pool was great although the water could have been kept a little cleaner. We rented the cabana for 1/2 day ($30), well worth it. They give you a cooler of drinks, chips, pretzels and fruit. The rooms were the typical hotel room, however, the beds and pillows are worth the stay. The restaurants again are the typical Caribbean restaurants - high priced and ok food. If you don't expect home cooking and home prices, you will be ok. The down side: Once there, unless you rent a car or pay enormous amounts for the tours (Old San Juan - $50 pp; Rain Forest - $40 pp and the Bio Bay Tour - $130 pp), you are stuck there. There is one store for a little shopping for some souveniers. There are no buses to take you anywhere and if you want to go into San Juan by taxi it will cost $160.00 round trip for up to 4 people. You have a choice for breakfast of either the buffet, room service or a donut at Davids; the outdoor pool restaurant or Marbella for lunch and 5 restaurants for dinner - two off site that you get to by shuttle. If you need to take the shuttle to the hotel from the airport the price is a standard $145.00 round trip for 3 people. If you are looking for a quite place to do nothing but hang out, swim and take long walks on the beach, this is your place. If you have kids who might be looking for a little more action and might get a little stir crazy doing nothing but relaxing, then the Westin will not meet your needs.

The hotel was very clean and well kept and the grounds were manicured beautifully. The beach was beautiful and clean but the sand isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t white. We had a Mountain View room, which had a beautiful view of the Rain Forest. We opted for the all-inclusive package, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we did because the food and drinks are pricey. The all-inclusive package includes all food (hamburgers, to prime rib and lobster) and premium liquor. I would suggest making dinner reservations as soon as you arrive. Room service is also included with your package without an addition fee. Make sure you receive a brochure of how to fill out your receipt for your food/drinks when you check in, so you will not be charged addition fees. Marbella was good for breakfast; breakfast consists of a buffet and omelets cooked to your taste. Marbella was good for lunch, you can choose from the buffet or from the a la carte menu (burgers, sandwiches, salads, ect). You can also enjoy lunch poolside at Club Coqui. Our favorite restaurants for dinner were The Grill Room at the country club, the prime rib, lobster, and shrimp were delicious. Palio had good Italian food and an excellent Caesar salad, which is made at your table. Nightly entertainment consist of a Casino and a good one man band in the lobby area, where people can dance. Downstairs outside Palio is a piano bar which is nice and relaxing. I would suggest renting a car for about $60 a day or a driver/taxi for tours. The Old San Juan tour is $48 per person from 9-3. It was 4 of us so we got a driver/taxi and it was $160 to Old San Juan. We also had the same driver to take us around Rio Grand.

We were then given an ocean-view room on the 6th floor, supposedly newly renovated.

Dinner the next day was at Marbella- I was sick the rest of the night. There were fruit flies attacking our food, but we didn't have a choice. Nothing else seemed to be open. What else was disappointing: One outside pool was closed all but one day we were there, one of the restaurants has closed (the only one with authentic Puerto Rican food) but the hotel lobby still advertises for it, you can't get anywhere outside of the resort unless you want to pay big bucks. $30 to go to the nearest grocery store. The poolside grill is closed and they were bulldozing the area and the beach around it. Just what I wanted to hear: bulldozers at the beach!

The Westin Rio Mar is perched above a cliff (much like the Wyndham Conquistador) and overlooks the ocean. It was beautiful, immaculately well-kept, and full of amenities that made leaving the premises unnecessary. The pools are nice, one with a water slide for kids and adults, and another pool has a waterfall you can stand up under in the heat. Most importantly, it had excellent restaurants to choose from (you can order in room for the same price), and had a Kids Club so that adults could enjoy water sports and/or gambling while the kids were entertained. (I believe it's $5 an hour for Kids Club and is open from 9am-5pm then from 9pm to midnight. Very family friendly. The local restaurants off site left MUCH to be desired for, so don't bother renting a car and paying for parking as you'll probably spend most of your time at the resort. I'm Puerto Rican, and the Puerto Rican food outside the hotel was terrible. They have tennis courts and golf courses as well. We paid $199 for an Ocean View but found out upon arrival that it is really a PARTIAL Ocean View, which mainly overlooked the pool. Be sure to specify FULL Ocean View as opposed to Partial when booking your reservations. The grounds were amazingly beautiful, with cabanas on the beachfront to hide in the shade. When driving into the resort, we noticed there were private villas that tourists can rent and still share the Westin's amenities. The website Theclusters offers more information, although the hotel was excellent.

I have to admit that I went into this vacation with my eyes wide open after reading a number of reviews from this website. It started with the fact that they gave our room away. Never a good way to start off. They put us in what I belive use to be a utility closet and said they would move us the next day. What is really frustrating is that, knowing our flight got in late I called the day before to confirm our resevation and to ensure that all was in order. The next day we were moved and the room \"looked\" better and although we booked ocean-front this was still a stretch. We could barely see the ocean from the fourth floor. After a terribly unfullfilling dinner at one of the property rest. I returned to my room only to realize that they placed us directly over the lobby bar. At 12:30 I was still listening to a very bad version of Gloria Gainer's \"I will survive\". I looked at my husband and said, \"I don't think I will survive.\" I called down to the front desk and told them about the problem, indicating that I was sure my file has a red flag next to it, but there was no way I could stay in my room. We were moved, AGAIN, the next day to a room we should have been in from day one. The only redeeming quality of this resort was the pool cabanas. You can reserve a pool cabana for $90 a day. This inlcudes 8 drinks (pop and water) and some snacks and fruit each day. Quite honestly, this was my lunch while there. The cabanas also provide the kids with shade and allowed me to sleep in, knowing that I would otherwise be up at 7:00 to secure chairs. Food was terrile except for Palio. They ran out of everything. (like coffee) There were two jet skis for a resort that accomdates 2500. We signed up to reserve a spot 5 days away and when that day came they had given our reservations away. Honestly, if you are making this your one trip away for the year, DO NOT book at this Westin. Go to St. John or the Caymans. This property no more represented the Westin Starwood Properties than my local Howard Johnsons. I am a long standing starwood preferred member, and they are getting an similar e-mail.

You can always wake up a little earlier to find a good spot...same thing with the beach. As for the beach yes it did have some waves but we found them very enjoyable since where they were it's still knee length. The sand was the softest sand i have ever felt and was not rocky at all!As for the restaurants- Shimas-not worth the money! The food was pretty bad although the ribs were the best ive tasted! Palio-Really nice place pretty good food! Cactus Jacks-one of the best places there of what we thought based on our order. Marbella-Fits the price range! Club Coqui-ok but to expencive for lunch i would recomend the iguana pub next to the Grille Room at the golf cource same type of food and more for half the price! The resort also had a teens clup great for the older ones instead of the game room. The rooms were all really nice and clean but as for the view keep in mind when you don't get ocean view they don't give you ANY where close to a view of the ocean or pool.

We did have a very nice vacation, but the irritations we had were hotelrelated. The Up Side: Beautiful location, gorgeous water and beach, friendly (albeit mostly ill-informed) staff, nice pools, wonderful beds, nice large room. The rain forest and snorkeling excursions we took were great! It is a quiet place...not much in the way of hopping nightlife, but we don't care about that, so it worked for us. The Downside: Our buffet breakfasts (which were quite nice) were included with our package, HOWEVER, all of the other food and drinks were grossly overpriced and unexceptional in terms of preparation/taste. $50 for a no-alcohol-or-desserts poolside sandwich lunch for two adults and a hotdog-eating kid? $10 for three cookies from the snack shop? $8.50 for an 8-oz margarita in a plastic cup? Our solution was to take a $30 ride to the nearest grocery store and buy a couple of six-packs of Fosters, bottled water, sodas and some snacks. Given the money we saved on just the beer ($14 for 12 bottles versus $82--tip included-- had we bought them at the hotel, we came out way ahead, even after the $30, 10-minutes-each-way cab ride) One evening, we went to Cactus Jack's (Tex Mex) for dinner and could only be seated at the bar, which was okay by us since we hadn't made reservations. During our meal, there was the intermittent smell of \"sewer gas\" which the waitresses told us came from the tennis club bathrooms situated below the bar. To combat the stench, they were spraying air freshener in the bar area while people were eating! When we returned to the main hotel, I spoke with the manager in charge who simply said \"Sorry.\" Given the cost to stay at the Westin, I expected more in terms of responsiveness from the management (maybe a free drink?) The grounds are lovely, but the hotel seems to have maintenance issues..for example, we were on a \"Starwood Preferred Floor\" and noticed many big spots of paint missing from hotel room doors, even on the \"Ocean Suite\" doors. In our bathroom, the showerhead dripped heartily when we ran the tub for a bath, tub faucets and temp control hardware appeared to be unsecured/ uncaulked...they moved around on the wall when we turned the handles. And the curved shower curtain rod sagged downward. Also, the hotel was full when we visited and this caused problems in trying to find on-site places to eat at reasonable times (i.e., not 10 pm). Understandable. We went to Marbella at 6pm and were told \"no tables 'til 10pm\", we then went to the pool restaurant and were told by the manager \"how about 9:45, or you could try Ajili Mojili..you won't need a reservation.\" We then went to the concierge who called ahead to Ajili Mojili for us and found out that they were, in fact, closed on Friday night. Then the concierge recommended Antojitos Puertoriquennos (a restaurant off the property, where we had eaten previously). We went to the head doorman (Juan...who was great) and he told us Antojitos had closed at 5pm, but he sent us to another restaurant (Richie's) which was great AND they sent a car to pick us up (no charge) because they knew that the Westin had no \"car-service\" vehicles available. Also, we did not rent a car and ended up feeling like Westin prisoners. Whenever I asked for \"a taxi\" at the front door, I was given a car-service type vehicle (i.e., had \"an arrangement\" with the hotel) and every trip cost $15 each way...even a 10-minute drive! It was nuts! Given that bus service outside of San Juan seems to be nearly non-existent and there were no sidewalks, we felt stuck. If we were to return, we would definitely rent a car and suck-up the $15/day parking fee (on a 480-acre property, please, it's not like they have limited space). Finally, the early-morning-chaise-lounge-reserving by people who never showed up was extremely annoying...the hotel should do something about this. It is obnoxious and unfair to the other guests. Other resorts I have stayed in have had no problem in posting signs and removing people's towels from lounges that go unused. WOULD WE GO BACK TO THE WESTIN??? Maybe, but we would definitely rent a car and consider renting a condo on the property so we would still have access to the casino/beach/pool/spa/restaurant amenities but more control over what/where/when we ate. I really do not mind spending money to eat while on vacation, but I would prefer to spend money to help the local economy rather than the Westin economy! Everything seemed very calculated to generate the maximum amount of money for the Westin as possible...as an example, no happy hour or drink specials at the beach bar and $2 for a tiny bag of popcorn next to the hotel playground, tiny ice buckets that made it hard to chill anything that did not come from the mini bar. It is a beautiful location...there is no denying that.

We came away impressed, and if we're to return to Puerto Rico, it's likely we'd stay here again. THE GOOD: The property and hotel are lovely. The public spaces are all tastefully done and attractive - a large lobby area has a number of cool seating areas and a bar and overlooks some of the restaurants on the level below. The casino is relatively small but very lively. We were happy with the rooms, which are standard Westin, and therefore a touch nicer than the average Caribbean room in resorts of similar caliber - they're nice sized, have an outdoor balcony with a table and chairs, and have all the fixings you'd expect from a Westin - including a couch, handsome desk and the heavenly bed. The bathrooms are really very nice, with a great shower and separate room for the toilet. The outoor areas are nicely done as well, with landscaping that's very pretty but not overdone. There are essentially two large pool sections - one right next to an outdoor bar/lunch restaurant and the (annoying) music that comes with it, and another further away that's much quieter. The pools are very nice, with plentiful chairs bordering it. The exterior of the hotel was attractive as well - it looks like the upscale resort you're paying for. By far, the reason to come here is the beach, which, compared to the beaches we've been to in San Juan, is the nicest we've seen in Puerto Rico. As it's 45 minutes from San Juan, the hotel is in a relatively secluded area and its beach stretches for a mile or so - and it's beautiful. Puerto Rican beaches aren't white sand, but the water is beautiful, there are plenty of chairs, and it's deep enough that you can easily find a spot without people right on top of you. Great, great beach (complete with wait service, should you want it). Finally, there are a number of bars to choose from located in different parts of the resort - plenty of different places to sit an enjoy a drink or cigar. THE BAD: The hotel is something of a trek from the airport: 35 min - 1 hour, depending on traffic - which could be longer if you're taking one of the shuttles included in your package. We chose instead to take a taxi for the speed of it, and that costs roughly $65 each way with tip. (If you do this, make sure you ask your travel professional to take out the airport transfers from your package - which cost extra $$.) The road there looks more like you're on the outskirts of Miami than somewhere Caribbean. The service is hit or miss. It ranged from very friendly and accommodating to \"I'm annoyed that you're asking this of me\". Overall, more good service than bad, though. Finally, once you're there, it's likely you're staying there. Other than being adjacent to El Yunque (the rainforest), there isn't anything worth seeing or doing in the immediate area. Other restaurants are a cab ride away minimum, and there aren't many options. THE UGLY: As you've no doubt read by now, the restaurants do leave something to be desired. Don't get me wrong - none of the food is inedible or scary, and some of it is pretty good stuff. But more often than not, it's completely generic and expectedly very pricey. Worst of all, none of the seafood at the resort is locally caught - all of it is flown in, we learned, and therefore more expensive and not as fresh as you'd like. There are a number of restaurants to choose from - which is nice - and they're located all around the sprawling resort (some of which you'll access by a trolley). But the biggest disappointment was Palio - their \"destination\" Italian restaurant. The room itself is really fun and attractive, but it pretty much ends there. The tomatoes in my wife's $16 pomodoro were incredibly mealy - to the point where we actually sent it back. We ordered room service one night (from their full service Marbella restaurant) and the hamburger was of surprisingly poor quality. The lunch menu is pretty spartan, with no good salads and sandwiches that were so-so at best. We did enjoy Ajili Mojili - a Puerto Rican restaurant that is an outpost of the original in San Juan. We've eaten at the original, which is better than this watered down version, but it was still the best and most interesting meal we had while there. There is also a Tex-Mex and an Asian restaurant there, but we didn't try either. The $20 lo mein wasn't calling us. A hint: either load up on their adequate buffet breakfast ($18) in the Marbella restaurant and skip the marginal lunch options, or hit the David's Cookies adjacent to the casino, which has hot breakfast sandwiches, yogurts, muffins, coffee, etc. for a lot less. If we'd stayed longer than three nights, the restaurants would have been more of a problem. OVERALL: Due to the lack of interesting food at the resort and the inaccessibility of other places, a seven night stay can get a little long. But the good in this resort outweighs the bad, in our opinion, and if you're looking for a very nice resort with a great beach in Puerto Rico, you'll be hard pressed to find a nicer spot than the Westin.", "Date": "March 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice visit\u201d", "Author": "biora", "ReviewID": "UR3234292", "Content": "I very nice property.

Now for the BAD - My boyfriend and I booked our room through American Express and our package included an upgraded room (based on availiability), free buffett breakfast for 2 each day and a $100 credit at the Spa. When we arrived the woman at the front desk told us our room had alreday been upgraded and we were pleased - however, when we got to our room we clearly had NOT been upgraded. We called down to the front desk and were told that a junior suite was not available for the first night, but we could switch to one to following day for the remainder of our stay. We were disappointed, but understanding since the hotel seemed to have a few different conventions/conferences going on. The next morning we checked in with the front desk and were told (quite nastily) that our new room was not available yet and to come back later. When we went back to the front desk again at 3pm we were then todl by another person that there were NO junior suites available. We were obviously upset and confused since we had been told by 2 different people that a junior suite was available. It wasn't the fact that an upgrade was not available that upset us, it was the manner in which we were treated and questioned in a way as if we made the whole thing up!!!!

I will start with the positives: -The staff was very friendly, (even if they had no idea what they were talking about) - The beach and pool area were very nice, and you can take long walks on the beach if you are willing to leave the hotel area -The golf course was well maintained and the clubhouse is quite nice - The ice cream at David's was really good It goes without saying that resorts overcharge for food, drinks and services so I'm not basing my negative comments on pricing. The negatives: -The hotel restaurants were very average. The fish at Shimas (Japanese) was extremely fishy and therefore (most likely) not fresh. Coqui (Pool bar) uses fake crab in their lobster sandwich. etc. Palio, The Grille and Cactus Jack's were all fine but not memorable. Unfortunately, the local restaurants left a lot to be desired. We rented a car and made the one hour trip to San Juan for good food. The Parrot and Pamela's in San Juan were truly wonderful! -The rooms seemed dirty. The tile floors needed to be washed. The bathrooms were certainly not on the same \"heavenly\" level as the Westin in Boston or Chicago. -My husband mistakenly left several poker chips in the room one morning. When we returned a few hours later they were gone. We did not make a big deal out of this but reported it to security for their records. They launched into an initial CSI investigation mode, but we never heard from them again. Use the safe. -The Concierge desk was friendly but full of misinformation. They do not have a clue about where to dine outside of the resort. Their literature claims that the rainforest is 10-19 miles away. It is 2 miles away. They told us that a cab to the airport would cost $70 + $15 per person. It cost $60. Again, not a big deal, but doing your own research is worth the time. - The hotel had 2 conventions going on at all times, which adds an institutional feel to your experience. When we arrived the first night, the bar overlooking the ocean was closed for a private party, and the afternoon we left, the pool area closed at 2 PM for another private party. For a big, convention type hotel, the experience was perfectly fine. If we choose to return to Puerto Rico, we would stay in a smaller hotel with a nice beach, closer to San Juan.

The rooms: Standard, smallish, nothing special - and if you want a fridge it will cost you $65 a week (mini bar in the room though). The staff: By and large we found the STAFF to be warm, helpful, and welcoming - particular kudos to Shelly Ann and Erich who are part of the pool staff/kids activities groups. Wait staff, particularly at breakfast was warm and welcoming. Security: I had $200 taken from my wallet in my room on our first night there - the safe was not working and we had not had time to get it fixed so there was no secure place to stash our valuables. I reported it to security and management, and response was very slow. After 3 days we found out that they refunded me the $200 to my room account, but the only reason we figured it out was because we were scrolling through our room account on the TV menu - otherwise they would have never informed us of this. New computerized safes were installed a few days before we left so that may address this problem. Management: See my comment under security! Food: Ok but not great and very expensive. Our best meal was had at Cactus Jacks which is on the property. If you can get a deal with the breakfast buffet included - do it. We would gorge at breakfast and then only need to purchase dinner. Spa: Really quite beautiful and brand new. The therapists and aestheticians were excellent. however, the reception staff is woefully uninformed about the services, and could never answer my questions about services. Also - some of the services listed in the brochure are not available. Pool: Excellent and big - really nice water slide too. Lots of fun watching iguanas around the pool area, and the kiddie pool is great for kids -(between 130 and 230 they have organized games there). There is also a \"quiet\" adult pool - nice for those who don't want kids. The spa tub was not working properly on some days - but when it was - it was nice and large! Ocean is a few steps away , but a little choppy for small children. Casino: Small - less than desirable blackjack rules (can only double 8,9,10,11), dealer does not check for blackjack first so you may play out a hand and waste doubles and splits. Other fun stuff here - iguana feeding at 11, rainforest a few minutes away, bioluminescent bay near by (consider booking excursions on your own - very expensive when done through hotel), consider Old San Juan day trip - try and do it on a weekend as traffic stinks on weekdays.

Only from the top floor, however, the ocean view is unobstructed. Mostly, the view is partial ocean and swimming pools. Although that is pleasant, it does not stand up to the \"oceanfront\" description. One can hardly see any ocean through the palm trees from lower floors. We were first upgraded to a 5th floor Ocean Suite that was not impressive - fairly dark, and not much of the view from the balcony. The hotel is big - over 700 rooms, but we had no problem finding empty beach chairs, enjoying the sea. Staff are really friendly, helpful, willing to listen and help. Room service was offered twice daily, parking rate was 10$, and 50$ return airport shuttle was available too. Food was expensive for Puerto Rico, but not for an isolated, major hotel chain resort. For better value, try a popular Mexican restaurant Lolita - 5 miles towards Fajardo right on Highway 3. The resort seemed ideal for families with children. There were always lifeguards at the beach and pools. For the romantic experience a private dinner is offered on the beach; we saw a table one night with candles among the palm trees on our way to the garage.... For a honemoon, that seems like a good option. San Juan should not be missed, however, and the hotel is not convenient for the city.

Thank goodness I did! I have to admit, I was very wary once reading the mixed reviews that this hotel has received over the years. Frequently, the reviews alternate radically from one to the next. I very nearly called to cancel the trip and stay somewhere else. I am so incredibly happy that I didn't. Upon arrival at the airport, we were greeted by a Westin representative and once our bags were procured, we were taken to their air-conditioned bus and offered bottles of cold water. After waiting for a few minutes for some more guests to arrive, we made the 40-minute trip to the hotel. The place was gorgeous. First, I'll start with the hotel itself. The furnishings, and the general ambiance was great. Everything had a very tropical, elegant feeling to it. We waited for about five minutes on line to check in, and it went very smoothly. We, along with our bags (all of the luggage, except for the golf clubs which were immediately taken to the clubhouse), rode up in the elevator with a bellman who was incredibly nice and informative. Our room was great. It wasn't huge, wasn't incredibly luxurious -- but it was clean and comfortable (not to mention the infamous Heavenly Beds -- definitely worthy of their name). Our view was amazing. A straight view of the grounds and the ocean beyond. The balcony was adequate and had two comfortable chairs and a matching table. One of my traveling companions (the golfer) was interested in getting in a round before dinner, so he called the clubhouse. This is where we ran into a snag. They were having a tournament that day, and he was unable to get on the course -- either course. Here's a tip: If you are a golfer, when making your reservations, call the hotel to find out if there are any events at either of the courses during your stay (there are two -- the river course, and the ocean course). Since neither of the golf courses are owned by the hotel (they have a share in them that allows golfers from the Westin access), you have to make sure that there are no events scheduled. He went downstairs to speak with the manager. She was polite and apologized for the inconvenience, giving us two free lunches the next day. Should she have given him a free round of golf? Yeah, she should have. But she didn't. Hence the four-star rating rather than a five. Once getting over that hurdle, we went downstairs to a restaurant called Marbella. Marbella is the casual dining, everyday place. It's pricey, yes. But you have to expect that when going away. If you go to a resort thinking that you can be frugal, your naivete is going to get you into trouble. These places are expensive. The food was great, the service impeccable. If you do decide to go, ask to sit in Juan's area -- he's there for breakfast and lunch. The grounds were amazing. Meticulously cared for, and absolutely stunning. We're normally beach people, but we weren't big fans of the sand quality (it's a little muddy), so we spent most of our time under a cabana tent by the quiet pool. Here's another tip: Get down there early if you want one of the two available cabana tents. We're early risers, so it was great. There are umbrellas that you can sit under, but the tent was pretty awesome. A previous reviewer mentioned that the iguanas were like dogs, and they were right. It was pretty amazing to see these dinosaur like creatures waddle out from the surrounding greens and walk along the pool area. We even saw a few of them take a dip in the pool! They don't bother you -- much preferring to nibble at some of the grass than take a bite out of a tourist. They're so used to having people around that it almost seems that they stop to pose for pictures, of which many were taken. At the pool area, waiters and waitresses frequently stop by to ask if you want a drink, or some food from the Coqui bar (named for the famed Coqui frogs). They even carry laminated menus with them for those not familiar with the food selection. If you go during the summer, you have to realize that it is the off-season. This is when hotels do repairs. It's the price you pay for lowered rates and a less crowded atmosphere. We were a bit disappointed that the italian place, Palio, was closed. But we did go to the Asian restaurant, Shimas, and had some amazing food. We're generally casual diners, so we spent most of our nights at Marbella. They have buffets on several evenings, and did have a selection from Palio available. We got some amazing Italian food. If you go when it's open, I highly recommend it. Before I finish my rambling, I would like to say that we had a great time. We are definitely going back next year, and I highly recommend this resort. If you find that the service isn't to your liking, try to smile. Be extra friendly.

We had a broken t.v. when we arrived and it was exchanged with a new one within 15 minutes. We had room service daily and it always arrived before the estimated time. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. Our room was \"resort view\" and we had a very nice view of the pool area and the ocean in the background. We ate at all of the restaurants except for Palio's (which was no opened) and Ajili Mohili. All of the food was very good. My favorite was the Asian/Sushi restaurant. We also enjoyed the Grille Room. The food, however, was very pricey at all of the food establishments. This is the only complaint that I've read on Trip Advisor that I agree with. My boyfriend and I decided to pay the extra money and do the All Inclusive meal plan. It was more money but it was well worth the extra cost. We both loved the resort and had a great vacation.

The management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate response? They moved us to a similar room but in a construction zone, offered her a doctor to see and left us an ice pack and bandage.

Cliff wanted to get back to us with a response. For days we waited. Upon check-out we called again only to learn that Cliff was out that day but left word to relieve our bill of two of the miserable and high-priced meals we were trapped into at two of the Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three restaurants. We read the note he left on the screen for the subordinate: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Give them two free meals and, if necessary, something else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The subordinate quickly closed the screen and she deemed nothing else necessary.

We were a little leary of a big resort as we stayed in small places all of this trip and on our previous trip, but we were VERY impressed. Upon check-in, we asked if there was any way to get an upgrade and were given an upgrade to a \"pool view\" room, which, to our suprise was actually also a beach view. We were travelling with 2 small children, but that was no problem, as this resort was full of families with children and was very family friendly. We requested a crib for our 3 month old and it was brought to our room very promptly. The pool was great- our son fell in love with the pool slide and exhausted us daily by going down it multiple times. One very nice thing is you have the option to go to either the pool or the beach- they are right by each other. The other thing that is very cool about this place is the local iguana population. They are like dogs. You will be sitting reading a book by the pool and next thing you know, an iguana is hanging out by you. They are quite large and are unfazed by people. They have an iguana feeding at 1100 several times per week, so make sure to catch it, especially if traveling with children. One thing to watch out for is that the food is VERY expensive. Our family (2 adults and our toddler) plus a friend of ours ate a very bland mexican food dinner- not very big at all and the bill came to $100. This was entrees (no seafood- taco salads) for all and one beer each for the adults. Ouch!!!!! There is plenty of good local food right outside the gate. Our favorite was a pizza place- we can't remember the name, but it was just off the main highway, on the right hand side as you turn on the street to the resort- there is a candy shop right next to it.

We reserved and paid for ocean-view rooms. Although the rooms faced the ocean, it was barely visible through the large palm trees in front of our balcony. We had reserved 2 rooms, but one of them was not ready yet since we had arrived prior to the 3:00 p.m. check-in time. We were told that we could get into one of the rooms to relax and store our luggage and they would bring up the keys to the second room when it was finished. Finally, about 3:30 p.m. we returned to the front desk to retrieve the keys to our other room. We also had no key to the safe in our room. We contacted the front desk. Four hours later, still no key. We visited the front desk again who called security. Security said they were never called about the problem the first time. The desk attendant said that if they didn't deliver a key to our room within 20 minutes or so that we should try contacting security OURSELVES.

I called housekeeping and requested 2 washcloths, but the next day following service to our room, no more washcloths! We ate breakfast at Marbella twice and both times had to catch the waiter's attention to please bring us the check. Once he brought our coffee and juice, we were totally ignored -- no follow-up whatsoever to see if everything was okay or if we needed anything else. Upon leaving the restaurant and passing by the hostess stand I am accustomed to a \"Thank you! Have a nice day!\" or other acknowledgement of our patronage. Not here. One of my kids had a newly-opened bag of Starbursts candy laying on the desk and upon returning from dinner found it nearly empty. (Housekeeping had apparently helped themselves during their evening visit.) Parasailing was unavailable because the boat was broken and they didn't know when it would be fixed. Three of the four waverunners were also out of commission. No apologies from any of the watersports staff.

The Hotel itself was beautiful but the majority of the staff was extremely rude. The valets, the woman that checked us in and the servers at the Mirabella restaurant were the only pleasant people we found. We had a smooth check-in but from that point it was downhill full speed. We checked in at the \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" counter. Which was pleasant. Once we got to our room the trouble began. We had to call down to house keeping to change our feather pillows to foam pillows (even though we requested that ahead of time due to allergies) and waited for about 1/2 hour for them to come. Then we only had 4 hangers in our closet, so we called house keeping, who brought up flimsy wire hangers...We were almost finished unpacking when I realized that the safe was missing it's key. So my husband made another call to have that taken care of. We were told they would be up within an hour to replace the lock. So instead of waiting in the room, we headed to the pool with our valuables and cash. After finishing at the pool, we headed to the concierge and proceeded to wait on line for 15 minutes as there was only ONE. After asking for suggestions for local restaurants we were given a binder (the only binder) of menus for the hotel's restaurants and were brushed aside before we were finished. After 2 1/2 hours we returned to our room to discover that the safe was not fixed. My husband called down to the desk again...no answer.....called a second time....no answer. So we went downstairs and stood at the \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" counter to be helped. There were a few people waiting on the \"regular line\" and they were being helped, which is fine with me, I didn't mind that. But once the people that arrived after we did started to be helped before us we got upset. I'm not really sure what the \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" gets, but I intend to cut up my card and mail it back to The Westin since it seems to be useless. My husband then left me on that line to get on the \"regular line\" and was finally helped. All the while the counter people saw me standing there waiting. We stated that our safe was still not fixed and our other issues. They basically shrugged their shoulders at us and offered to let us keep our things in their safe. I'm sorry, but at this point there was no way I would trust them with anything. We asked to speak to the manager and she was down right nasty. My husband politely asked if they could do something for us for our inconveniences. With disgust she said she could give us breakfast the next day. My husband then politely asked if they could do something for us for dinner since by this time it was 7:30pm and we still had no idea where to eat since the one and only concierge was no help. She very rudely replied \"I said I can give you breakfast\". We are very tolerant people, but that was the last straw. When we returned to our room my husband called the Westin headquarters to speak to someone about our issues, which after only being there a few hours were many. After he got off the phone the hotel manager called and rudely told us we would be getting 2500 Starwood points, then she hung up. Apparently she was not happy that we called The Westin customer service to complain. I decided to take a shower to relax and there were 2 towels, no wash cloths and no soap...yet another call to house keeping. The bartenders at the pool bar were nasty as well. If you order a drink and you get the wrong thing...watch out if you question it....they'll take your drink back and walk away mumbling something in Spanish (lucky for us but un-lucky for the bartender my husband speaks Spanish and understood what he said...and it wasn't nice). The self parking lots were always full since non-hotel guests can park in the closer lot and hang out at the casino, beach and pool there while the paying guests have to walk a mile from their cars because all the spots in the garage are taken. This is after they charge you $10 a day to self park. The pool area was always crowded and the so called \"Quiet Pool\" was nothing of the sort. There were kids jumping around yelling and screaming, leaving food all over the ground, throwing balls and jumping off floats and not once did anyone from the hotel enforce the \"quiet pool\" rules. And be sure to get to the towel hut early, those run out fast. I could go on forever, but you get the idea. I went on TripAdvisor before the trip and saw alot of bad reviews but I thought 'it can't be that bad'! The next time I read multiple bad reviews I will take the advise. We gave the Westin the benefit of the doubt and am I ever sorry. I can without a doubt say this was the worst hotel experience we've ever had. After taking our own \"survey\" of other hotel guests during our stay, we found out that we were not the only ones who felt this way.

I had read all the reviews extensively, about this hotel before leaving. The flavor that you get from reading these reviews is accurate. The hotel grounds and beach are first class. The beach privacy is perhaps its best feature. The beach is well-maintained, groomed every morning, and there were adequate chairs and beach umbrellas. The pools were beautiful, and very nice. The rooms are just average--not fancy by any stretch of the imagination. They are well soundproofed. They served well the only function that we could request of them -- a place to sleep. We found the staff to be friendly and polite and attentive. I was continually amazed at the check-in line at the front desk, every day. They are truly long waits regarding check-in. The price of drinks is unfortunately and unnecessarily ridiculous -- a glass of wine costs $10 and beach drinks --8.50. We did like the breakfast buffet (did that twice) which is served in the main facility-- at a price of $18 for adult and nine dollars for children (once my 19 and 16 year olds were childern--the other time adults; go figure). What we did for most breakfasts however was to buy boxes of dry cereal, local fruit, plastic bowls, plastic spoons, and purchase a large glass of fresh milk at the snack bar every morning. Much cheaper. They do have a nice outdoor lunch facility near the end of the larger pool for very nice sandwiches and french fries. Soft drink refills are free. The lunch menu items are about 10-12 dollars each, and splitting a sandwich provides ample portions. Cactus Jack's was only average, and expensive. The Grill was supposedly our fancy dinner for the vacation -- our last night. It was very stiff and formal. Entrees averaged about $40-- a total of $250 for four people and less than average quality. There is a nice shopping plaza in Fijardo--about a 15 minute drive further east from the Hotel, which has several choices for restaruants/dining/theaters at a much more affordable cost. I would definately rent a car from the airport (Hotwire), which we were able to get for 26$ a day. The additional $10 per day parking fee at the hotel is somewhat insulting, but seems to be standard these days. There is quite a great distance between parking and the hotel -- more than a five-minute walk. The hotel is directly across from the road that goes to the rain forest--which is free if you don't stop at the visitors center. We were able to drive into San Juan/Old San Juan without too much difficulty and is a definate must do-- it is approximately 30 minute drive. In Fijardo we were able to do a Bio Bay Kiak tour(you can bargin to get to a price of 25-30$ per person), and a separate cataraman snorkel excursion (Eastwind--59$ per person--lunch, drinks and gear provided--a 6 hour adventure). The concierge desk will give written directions about how to reach these places, and be sure that you get these directions. We found driving to be very confusing. The roads are narrow and often in poor condition. There is no such thing as a street sign anywhere, and we encountered difficulties in this respect on numerous occasions. The directions from the concierge desk will be very beneficial in that they are given in terms of stoplights and landmarks to allow you to get to your destination. Driving by yourself will save you substantial amounts of money in terms of the price that would cost if you arranged these functions through the hotel and their transportation.

We were originally given a 1st floor room and to get to the parking lot had to either go to the 3rd floor, pass through the lobby, pass the casino and arcade, then to an elevator back down to the 1st floor to the parking garage OR we would have to walk around the outside of the hotel. In regard to being a \"4-star\", there's just no way. Checked in as a member of Starwood Preferred. Requested possibility of an upgrade and was told it would be $50 per night. Was given a 1st floor room with the view of the top of a palm tree, literally-we might as well have had no window-we couldn't see anything. There was no hair dryer in the room which surprised me due to the humid climate. On day 3, finally decided it would be worth the extra $50 per night to have some sort of view. Went to the front desk, and was given an upgrade to a partial ocean view room for free-go figure. In the 2nd room, the safe did not have a locking mechanism, but the room DID have a hairdryer. The pools were nice. We actually had more r&r at the larger, kid-friendly pool. because the \"quiet\" pool was full of kids. The beach was great-good bodysurfing waves and barely crowded. But a warning about the beach. We found 2 jagged peices of broken bottles in the water, where the swimming beach was. Lucky for us we found them before we stepped on them. We also saw that someone else had put peices of broken bottles on a lounge chair by the beach-just assuming they had found them while swimming, too. So, watch your feet. The Tiki bar charges $8.50 for a little Pina Colada-to be expected at a resort, but wanted to warn you.

The hotel itself, the beach and the grounds are superior, absolutely gorgeous and immaculate. The beach especially is extremely well-maintained. They have ample chairs, some are cushioned, both alongside the beautiful pools and on the beach itself. But for a high-priced resort we were disappointed with a few points. The rooms are a bit sub-standard for a resort and the housekeeping is so-so (our maid forgot face towels entirely one day). The bathrooms were not spotless as you'd expect from a Westin. As well, this is a picky point, the hotel says that they deliver a newspaper to your room every morning, but none ever came. When I called to inquire, the concierge rudely said they had discontinued this service. I've never stayed in a Starwood or a comprable hotel where they didn't deliver a paper to your door every morning. The hotel literature provided, as well, is sadly out of date. The restaurants were ridiculously overpriced. The Grill Room was well-worth it as the food was excellent, but the other restaurants had below-average food. The Tiki Bar prices were insulting as well. We rented a car at the hotel and were forced to pay for hotel parking, which is just silly. At such a resort, to be \"nickel and dimed\" is just insulting. Also, avoid the tours the hotel offers. They are beyond ridiculous in terms of their prices. They charge $75 for a tour of the rainforest, when you can rent a car for that money, tour it leisurely on your own for free, and drive someplace else for dinner. As well, as the hotel is on a country club golf and tennis club, I suspect that many of the pool and beach occupants were club members' families. It is a kid friendly (albeit very expensive) place, but if you don't have kids and you don't like loud children in your \"quiet pool\", avoid avoid avoid.

The staff was pleasant and accomodating not once was the word \"No\" uttered when we had a request. Check in was smooth, we were given a free upgrade to a full ocean view, so be sure to ask. Room service took no more than 35 minutes. Juan at the breakfast buffet (Marbella) treated my family like we were part of his family (so much so that my 8 year old son was in tears the day we said goodbye). Henry and Ivan made sure that we always had a cold beverage at the Tikki Bar. They also made sure that our lunch was prepared in quick fashion. Dinner at Palio was wonderful...be sure to have Jesus as your waiter. Joelle tends bar right outside Palio, best bartender at the resort...I taught him how to make a great espresso martini, be sure to ask him for one. He noticed that my wife and I had reservations for a second night at Palio, he had my cigar and champagne ready for us ahead of time for that pre dinner cocktail. Cactus Jacks was disappointing, food was average at best, and our waiter there was definately a rookie. The pool area was delightful...The activity pool was perfect for the kids (14 and 8 years of age). Yet during peak time of year we thought the pool seemed quiet. There were plenty of chairs pool side. The pool deck is definately in need of repair/upgrade, and they could use a few more umbrellas as well as replacing some of the damaged ones. The beach was also fantastic. This is the Atlantic, not the Carribean Sea...yes there are waves, no the sand is not the white powder, yet still soft. Plenty of lounge chairs and Tikki Huts on the beach. Not once during our stay did I hear a complaint about not having a place to sit outdoors. What was also nice was the fact that the hotel/beach/pool area were very close to one another. We have stayed at other resorts where to get from point A to point B was sometimes quite a journey. This was very convenient...again especially for the kids.

Go with the All Inclusive....The exclusions are minimal, we certainly got our moneys worth and then some...Staff, no complaints see above; room, not musty, love the Westin beds, rooms do need a little updating, they do seem a bit old. No HBO? Missed the Sopranos. Lobby/Restaurants/Public areas were beautiful. Casino, dont make that the deciding factor. I dont gamble, but that casino was pretty comical. Definately for the small time/casual player. Food, better than Iberostar and other resorts that we have experienced.

It was an incredible stay. Being a Starwood Platinum member, got upgraded to an oceanview suite. Beautiful room, amazing views. Checked in at 2am, and even at that insane hour, the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Hotel has two pools...an activity pool which is a little louder, and an adult pool which is a lot more peaceful. Poolside service was a bit slow, but well worth it when it showed up. It had your usual high priced drinks, but that's expected. Keep an eye out for the huge iguanas that like to come and hang out on the pool deck. Only complaint with the property was the scuba shop on the premises. The people were extremely rude and unhelpful, and their prices are outrageous. Much better to go directly through the scuba operators in Fajardo. I have stayed at the Westin in the Grand Caymans as well as the one in St. John and this property is definitely better than the Caymans and almost as good as the St. John Westin which is my favourite Starwood property so far.", "Date": "March 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Westin!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1723649", "Content": "Just returned from a quick stay at the Westin Rio Mar (March 12, 2004).

I read some of the reviews here before leaving and agree with some of what was said but would like to set the record straight on a number of things. First our room was very nice(not musty), pool and ocean view and the maid service was excellent. The food depending on the restaurant was good to excellent(I can't understand how people have complained about the food here), I highly recommend the Sea Bass at Ajili Mojili(authentic PR dishes) in the Ocean Villas and the Porterhouse steak at the GrilleRoom(located above the golf clubhouse, great views). KEY TIP: Find out early the days each restaurant is open during your stay and make reservations, it is very hard to walk-up and get a table even if the restaurant doesn't look full. The views of the rainforest were incredible, and there was lots of great nature sounds in the evening(The Coqui frogs!) One of the primary reasons we chose this resort was for the golf, and both courses are very nice but not spectacular, they charge $165 to play earlier in the day(way overpriced) but offer a twilight rate that starts at 2pm for $105(We booked our tee times in advance right at 2pm) the pace of play was great and you have incredible views of the mountains and plenty of wildlife(birds & iguanas of every size). The pools and ocean swimming are great just keep in mind the beach is brown sand and not white. If you are looking for lots of nightlife this is not the place for you, the only real nightlife is the small Casino(And I mean Small!) which is very poorly run. Overall the service at the resort was fairly good, a little inconsistent at times but not too bad, but the service in the Casino is terrible, the dealers and cashiers are not friendly and there are many slot machines not working properly and they don't know how to run a craps table(many payouts screwed up) and the cocktail waitresses in the casino are horrible they disappear for long stretches and one forgot to bring my drink twice and then finally brought me the wrong drink, you will end up going to the lobby bar for drinks, and it doesn't make sense because the casino is so small. We were looking for a scenic resort with good food to relax and play golf for a week. This resort fit the bill pretty well. If you don't play golf, and are looking for a wider range of activities I would recommend one of the many resorts in San Juan, but if you are looking for great views, good food, relaxing by the pool with a Pina Colada, and a few rounds of golf the Westin Rio Mar is an excellent choice.", "Date": "March 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay! But keep in mind...\u201d", "Author": "lifelongNYER", "ReviewID": "UR1683938", "Content": "The Westin was a beautiful hotel with friendly, courteous & extremely helpful staff. Upon arrival, check in went slow & we did get offered a below average room... however, after asking for an upgrade, we received one of the BEST rooms possible at no additional charge! The beach was private & beautiful however there is brown sand not white so those of you who feel it's dirty - it's not! It did get a little littered by the end of our 8-day stay but NOTHING to complain about. The pools were perfect - with the exception of no swim-up bar & although the tiki bar was great & VERY relaxing the hours were too limited. The food/restaurants at the hotel were well-above average - except that they were not always open so if you are looking to JUST be at the hotel the ENTIRE time you may want to take that into consideration. We rented an Avis car at the hotel (good price & cheap parking) and explored the island which we HIGHLY recommend doing! Don't expect 4-5 star areas or restaurants as you would find in the U.S. Mainland - but if you give it a chance you WILL find 4-5 star quality in both food & places to visit - ESPECIALLY with the people of P.R.!! The hotel is isolated so, for example, to get to San Juan is at least 40 minutes with a bit of traffic. We explored El Yunque which is a MUST! (GREAT tour through the Westin with Harry the tour guide!!). The East Wind Catamarran trip to Culebra is also HIGHLY recommended out of Fajardo. Luquillo beach is great but NOT in the public area of the beach!!! You must go INTO the area of Luquillo where seafood like King's & Sandy's are AMAZING & that area has the beautiful beaches. The kiosks off route 3 for \"Fast Puerto Rican Food\" seems scary but if you can get past what you are used to you will be in for a REAL TREAT!!! The Pina Colada's at La Roca Taina (#53 -#58?) out of the kiosks is awesome esp. for $3!!! And Hacienda Caribali for sunsets in Rio Grande overlooking El Yunque & Rio Mar was breathtaking! The food incredible - the service outstanding & again! THe Pina Coladas ROCKED!! Also - if you can muster up the energy - Old San Juan is truly magical... We ate at a local hideaway called El Jibarito (recommended in Frommer's) and it was some of the best Puerto Rican food we had on the island... For 2 meals & 4 Medalla's (Puerto Rican beer) the bill was under $35 with tip. The main drawback to staying at the Westin Rio Mar is the lack of nightlife. If you don't mind driving a bit - the El Conquistador is good for some nightlife & Isla Verde is about 30 minutes away & GREAT for nightlife. For golf the Westin seems wonderful (we don't golf) & again, if isolation is a factor for your trip it's a TERRIFIC place to be! We were able to get both - relaxation & adventure & we can't WAIT to go back to Puerto Rico! Also for those people who we've read reviews of that complain about things like the humidity & bugs & sporadic rainstorms... It's a CARIBBEAN ISLAND! IT'S TROPICAL! DON'T GO IF YOU EXPECT TO FIND THIS OASIS OF PERFECT WEATHER! IT'S NOT POSSIBLE! And to us the weather was pretty perfect! Also, please keep in mind - Puerto Rico's MAIN language is SPANISH! 90% of the people speak english well but it helps to know a little spanish.", "Date": "February 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunset Beach, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWonderfull Hotel - Great Vacation\u201d", "Author": "tuje", "ReviewID": "UR1664439", "Content": "The hotel was great the staff were helpfull and friendly.

The rooms at the Westin were musty. We paid extra for an Ocean view and the first room they gave us was not that. The second room you could see the ocean from the corner of the balcony. We rented a car and ate in Fajaro in a place called the Brass Cactus. It was good and less expensive. The pool and beach were crowded because it was a popular week. The front desk staff was nice to us but they were extremely rude to the people next to us. The bell staff was amazing. The airlines lost my luggage and they called them every few hours to check on it for me. They kept me updated and delivered my bag to my room when it arrived from the airport. We would not return to the Westin. There are just too many nicer places. The second half of our trip we stayed in Isle Verde at a Courtyard by Marriott and liked it better even though it was only 3 stars. I think from reading the reviews that it really matters when you travel. If it is a peak time then you may not want to stay here because it is crowded and they use all the rooms even the musty smelling ones. Also they are probably a lot more attentive on the off times.", "Date": "February 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middleton, WI", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular Beach\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1629139", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Rio Mar for four nights the last week in January 2004. We loved it. The facilities at this hotel are exceptional. Our room was spacious and had a balcony with a view of EL Junque rainforest (the hotels grounds are located ten minutes from the park's entrance). Our accomodations were spacious, bright and clean. The grounds of the hotel (over 500 acres and 1 mile of beach) were splendidly landscaped and maintained. The two pools were large and little used. The beach was clean and raked every morning. Lounge chairs were readily available as were hammocks. On the grounds are two 18 hole golf courses, a jogging path, clubhouse, condos, tiki bars, a small casino and a spa. The resort has 7 restaurants including a gourmet Italian restaurant, an oriental restaurant and Marbella where you can order off the menu or partake in an upscale buffet in the evening. On balance we thought that the Westin Rio Mar was a very nice resort and would stay there agian. Other reviewers of the Rio Mar have complained about the food, the service, and the indifference of the employees. The food is expensive. What do you expect? This is not a cheap resort. You are paying for the view and the ambience and both are spectacular. I was extremely impressed with the attitude of the employees. Waiters, bartenders, blackjack dealers, cleaning staff, all greeted us warmly and attended to our needs promptly. Food quality at the Marbella was good but not exceptional. We did not eat at Palio or the oriental restaurant so I can't comment on their food. Some people have complained about the remoteness of the resort and those complaints are accurate. Just keep in mind that because the resort is 30 miles outside of San Juan, the beach is cleaner and less crowded and you don't have to deal with the congestion and pollution of the city. Easy sidetrips from this resort that were fun included El Junque rainforest, Luquillo Beach (food kiosks on the beach were exceptional), the city of Ponce (2 hr. to the south) and bar hopping in Penones. Also, just outside the grounds of the Westin Rio Mar there are several inexpensive restaurants serving good food.", "Date": "February 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, TX", "Title": "\u201cA few bright lights but overall much worse than I expected\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1556262", "Content": "There were some good things, and some really poor things about this place during my stay. The location next to the beach is nice. You can walk from your room pretty much right onto the beach. And the view as you do so is breathtaking. If you go, though, ASK ABOUT OCEAN VIEW ROOMS when you reserve your room. When we got there, we asked and none were available. The higher floors are better--pedestrians can see right into the lower floor rooms if the curtains are open. The hotel was very clean and attractive, although the ventilation in the room hallways was sometimes really bad, to where the air would be warm, humid, and smell bad. Service ranged from rarely good to almost uniformly HORRIBLE. We frequently waited long times either to get our orders taken or to get the check. Twice, I waited for a check for over 20 minutes after the plates were cleared, and I eventually had to find managers to get them. The waitstaff often refuse to make eye contact and gave me the impression that they felt like I was somehow \"beneath\" them. A few times we had genuinely nice people serve us or help us with our bags, and the concierge and front desk were always nice, but I cannot overstate this enough: be prepared for awful service more often than not. We were there a week and it was not just once or twice. The casino was also the same story--several times I waited over 20-30 minutes to get someone to come service the slot machine I played so it would pay out. Unless you get up and find someone, they will not come, despite the cameras in the ceiling. If you want free drinks, better sit at the table games. My wife and I sat at the slots for 2-3 hours on two separate nights and never saw a waitress, either. We were very surprised to find a brochure in the room that said that ALL casino patrons are entitled to free drinks after the experience of those two nights. We brought this up to the front desk and they comped us a breakfast buffet, which was nice. The food is sometimes pretty good; the Italian restaurant Palio was really good. But you are so isolated in the resort that if you do not have a rental car, you have to eat all your meals there. And believe me, they OVERCHARGE because they know you have no other options. A breakfast buffet is $18.50 per person. A dinner buffet (for average food--a \"chicken parmesan\" is boiled chicken breast, no breading, tomato sauce and a few shreds of parmesan cheese) is $30.00 per person. A virgin strawberry daquiri (essentially strawberries and ice) at the beach bar is $6.00. Another warning: the hotel bill will include gratuities that you are not told about. I had a $2.00 housekeeping gratuity per day tacked on, and this was after I had left some tips on the pillow because I didn't know about the \"gratuity.\" I had the bellhop bring up our bags and tipped them when they did so. Lo and behold, I ended up with a separate $12.00 Bell Service Gratuity on my bill for that day that no one had ever told me about. Overall, I enjoyed the beach.

As a Christmas present, my parents invited me along on their trip to this resort. They had purchased the trip through Apple Vacatons for the dates of Dec 11th thru the 16th. They also spent the extra money to make it an \"all inclusive\" stay- meaning we ate and drank for free, and received discounts at the spa and golf courses. After reading most of the unhappy reviews on here, I was quite shocked. I don't understand how anyone could say anything bad. Upon arrival, they upgraded me to an oceanview room on the same floor my parents were on (the 7th floor- top floor and the best views). Every employee would go out of their way for us. The maid came twice a day. The bartenders would remember us and our drinks. The waitresses and waiters were more attentive than I could have hoped. I realize that if we didn't have all-inclusive, the priced would be more than I would expect, but it is a resort- you have to expect things to be more pricy than home. I do suggest that you get that package if possible, its easier just to sign your name, than have to carry cash around. The beach is amazing, as well as the pool. I was waiting to be attacked by bugs after reading everyone's reviews. I had no problem, even though I forgot my bug spray. I found an empty chair everyday at the pool and beach.
