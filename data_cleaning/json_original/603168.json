Overall room was clean but definitely an old room, with old furniture, and the bathroom had a TINY shower (with one of those on-the-wall soap-and-shampoo-in-one dispensers). We faced a side street so didn't have problems with noise that other reviewers complained about; but they were doing some interior construction/remodelling/painting of the hallways outside our room which made it impossible to sleep in late.

It was obviously a single room at one time with a double bed squeezed against the wall. Not enough hanging space meant most of our clothes were kept in the case. What really spoilt the trip though was the major construction site next door. Our room overlooked this directly. On arrival the hotel was full and they did not have any other rooms available to move any of our party to. The noise was immence and throughout the night every night, with no let up.

As one would expect, Istanbul has not changed, nor has this hotel, well, only a little. The hotel is situated in the very heart of the Old City, and really cannot be beaten for value. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable, and there are both TV and Internet for those who desire such things. There is also a lift to all floors, and from the top floor, just a few extra steps to the roof restaurant, which affords fantastic views over the Bosporus Sea. The staff are quite wonderful: very welcoming and very helpful. There is also a small but quite well stocked bar. The hotel is within a few minutes' walk of so many of Istanbul's attractions, and its winter prices make it superb value for money. So, how has the hotel changed since last year? Well, the breakfasts are bigger and better than ever - quite unbelieveable! And this year they have a lady who checks daily with all the guests to make sure all is well for them. What an excellent idea. Many an English hotel could learn a thing or two from The Hotel Ipek Palace. The one slight problem for some people may be that building work is taking place in the area, where a new Metro Station is being constructed. At times, there may be some noise. However, the staff do all they can to change rooms if people are affected by this. I can thoroughly recommend this very splendid hotel.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torquay, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ca gem of a find\u201d", "Author": "lynda g", "ReviewID": "UR126622394", "Content": "This hotel was the real star of our few days in the city.

On arrival we used the metro from the airport to reach the hotel, it cost us 4 lira per person which is like \u00c2\u00a31.50!! Much cheaper than shuttle bus/ taxi etc and really easy to use. There is usually a guard at every station so i pointed at the stop we wanted to reach and he would point the direction of the platform! When we arrived it was tricky to find the hotel as it is on a back street and not many people around could speak english. We managed eventually to find the hotel, the front view you see of the hotel is actually not the view you would see as you approach the hotel (you see the side view because it is located on a street corner) so that is why we didn't realise where it was. Eventually we found it and it is like 2 minutes from the metro stop which we found convenient later. I booked our holiday via lastminute.com including flights so to be fair we didnt pay a huge amount for the time we stayed, however on booking i did pay around \u00c2\u00a340 extra to upgrade to a 'superior double' which i would say is a standard (on the small side) double bedroom. Reading other reviews before i booked was the reason i paid more. We were on the 4th floor, and it was peacefully quiet. Our room was cleaned everyday, sheets changed daily, bathroom was clean, fresh towels daily. We had one cupboard which you could probably hang around 5-6 items in, a old style box tv (mostly turkish channels but there was mtv/bbc news/ al jazeera, nothing amazing) a dressing table/bedside table and a very large arm chair and still enough space to move around. The bed was not massive but it was fine for a couple. I did not find the mattress comfortable but my husband did not have any sleeping problems. We had a bath and shower and the bathroom was a comfortable size. Also it was snowing while we stayed there and i think there is under floor heating because the floors were always very warm which was perfect after we had walked in the snow all day!! There is a massive construction site right behind the hotel, we could see this from our window view and there are people working on it day and night. We could not hear any noise however unless the window was open. I think the windows were double glazed. There is also a mosque behind the hotel and we did hear the call for prayer at sunrise however there are many mosques in istanbul and i believe this would be the case in any other hotel too. It did not bother us that we could hear it. Breakfast was like a buffet, from 7-10.30, there is quite a variety of food available (cereal, bread, olives cheese etc) no fresh juice but they do have a juice machine that has like 8 different flavours (apple orange etc) Wifi was ok, we did have some nights where it would not work or disconnect frequently, but mostly it worked fine. It took us about 5 - 7 minutes to walk to Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. The hotel is also about 5 mins from the Sea where you can take ferry trips around the city. The side road from the hotel leads directly to the Spice Bazaar ( Misir Carsisi) in about 5 minutes also. The Grand bazaar is a little longer to walk however still within walking distance. We walked everywhere even in the evening late at night and we never felt unsafe. Local people are so friendly and they will try to help you if you are lost. The inner roads are lined with local take aways/resturants so you have a good choice of food if you dont want to eat at the hotel resturaunt. The food in Turkey is amazing and it is not expensive if you eat locally. There was also macdonalds/ burger king/ dominos pizza really close if you dont want turkish food. On returning, we did book a shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport which only cost us 20 lira (roughly \u00c2\u00a37.50) per person which picked us up on time and dropped us to the airport in about 30 minutes. It did stop to collect another passenger but they literally stopped for a minute to load the luggage and off we went. Overall, i think in turkey a 4* / 5* rating is not the same as it is in europe, however for the prices paid i think it was good value for money. Don't rely on star ratings go by reviews. There are so many hotels around 'Old Istanbul' because that is where all the sites are, and the roads are really small and crowded with shops as it is a really old city. But is is all part of the charm of the city. If you are going to visit Istanbul for luxury, then the old town is not for you, if you want to see all the historical sites then it is perfect. For us it was perfect as we just wanted somewhere to dump our stuff and sleep, and visit all the sites. We were out and about mostly and being in the location that we were, it was easy to take the metro across the river to the new city to see Taksim Square etc plus within walking distances of everything we needed to see in the Old city. Overall, it was good value for the money we paid, its a nice clean hotel presented well, we never had any problems with anything in our room. Not all the staff can speak english however there was usually one person at the main desk who could communicate with us perfectly in english at all times.

We were there to see Istanbul....!!!!! not live in our room for 7 days. The breakfast was good, just that if you got there after a 10h00 some of the foods were finished and they were not filling up again. (breakfast ended at 10h30) You get a kettle, cups...etc in your room, but you have to buy your own coffee, tea, milk sugar after the first day. The same with the bathroom soaps, shampoo....ect. ( I would advise the hotel to mention this to your guests before they book, some guests expect this to be replenished every day.) The A/C worked but did not cool down the whole room, so we slept with our windows wide open every night, listening to the sounds of the city.......& it was Rammadan.

Helpful, friendly and approachable. Now for the not so good stuff....Firstly that reception area is deceiving - it looks opulent and pretty big but the rooms are tiny. We upgraded to what they refer to as superior rooms..there was hardly room to move. When we got to our room we thought there had been a mistake & we'd gotten an economy room but apparently those are even smaller. There's enough space for what they believe is a double bed, a small single wardrobe and a desk. The bathroom was big but not sparkling white like i expected - a bit worn. Bearing in mind I was going by standards of big chain cheaper hotels of the UK such as Ibis & Novotel, I was expecting space & power showers and all sorts seeing as Ipek is supposed to be a 4*. Anyway the first night was a bit of a nightmare. AC didn't work, phone didn't work so we kept having to go to reception & room service was late. The staff being as helpful as they were couldn't do much that night as it was late but they moved us to a new room the next day which had a smaller bathroom but the room lay out was a bit better. If it's views you're after then don't go to Ipek Palas & don't look out of your window if you are there. Also when you're outside the hotel it does look like you're in the dodgy back streets but don't be afraid - everyone was very pleasant & it is a bustling place so please be aware that people and animals & cars do happen to make noise at any time of the day & night. Best things about the hotel is it's within walking distance of Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, the blue mosque and plenty of places to eat, the staff at the hotel are great and the food at the hotel is pretty good to0. They do have a pretty restaurant at the hotel on the top floor, the breakfast was a combo of strange things but for the most part not to bad. On our last night we requested an upgrade at an additional cost to one of their fancy rooms which was really nice & BIG! although bathroom tiny again.

It might take a day or two to familiarise yourself with the area, but once you have, you realise you are within walking distance of the two main mosques, the grand bazaar and spice bazaar, as well as restaurants and all the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctouristy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shops. Using the tramline to find your way is helpful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just follow it! The entrance to the Ipek Palas is pleasant enough, so too is the bar and the skyline restaurant but the one night we chose to eat there it was empty so there was no atmosphere and we left. But I am sure at the height of the tourist season, it is a great place to eat and from which to gaze over the Istanbul city tops. Staff at the hotel are helpful, especially one of the waiters who went out of his way to find a table on which to put our complimentary tea and cake (which is served every afternoon at 5pm) and who was generally attentive. What marred the stay somewhat was our room. We had holidayed on a budget and our room was very much an economy room with a double bed and a single bed. But the double was against a wall which is inconvenient for getting in and out (especially during the night when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to crawl all over your partner!) and there were no bedside tables or lamps. These might sound small inconveniences but a little bit of thought could make these lower-priced rooms so much more pleasant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and they do let down an otherwise excellent hotel (during our stay there was constant discreet painting and preparation for the main season). The shower room was a good size but lacked space to place toiletries and the wardrobe was a small single one. I feel sure that had we asked to be moved to a better room, our request would have been granted, but we rather lazily decided to make the most of it as we were only staying for five nights. The person we would have directed any requests or complaints to is kindly Guest Relations lady Bilge Ozdemir who greeted us upon arrival and gave us a summary of what there was to see and do while we sipped complimentary fruit juice. (Talking of fruit juice, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault the breakfast which was a mix of Turkish hot and cold food as well as more European cereals and boiled eggs!) Good experiences in Istanbul: Eating lunch at the tower restaurant across the bridge, the two bazaars and the blue mosque \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as a Hamman (but that is not for the bashful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wear a swimsuit if you have one!) Bad experiences in Istanbul: The palace, billed as Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number one tourist attraction was a disappointment. It is simply a museum and a rather \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 one at that with no atmosphere from the days it was inhabited. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcharem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 part sounded interesting but that means paying another entrance fee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and again only comprises empty rooms. The carpet sellers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do not make eye contact with him, engage in any conversation at all or even smile as you will never shake them off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c likewise the persistent restaurant staff whose job it is to stand outside their premises and encourage you to eat there. They are not as bad as the carpet salesmen but you do get a bit fed up when you have run the gauntlet of a string of restaurants. Finally, beware the pricing outside restaurants. Sometimes it is in Euros and sometimes in Turkish lire \u00e2\u20ac\u201c make sure you are not thinking lire when you see Euros \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it makes a lot of difference and we allowed ourselves to be fooled a couple of times.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Espoo, Finland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service\u201d", "Author": "tintti71", "ReviewID": "UR105713392", "Content": "Loved the hotel and service.

Yes we gambled on a secret hotel deal with one of the major late booking companies but assumed that as the hotel had a 4 star rating our room would be of a certain standard. Unfortunately for us our room was tiny with a bed pushed against a wall with hardly any room for us to move around or unpack our luggage. The view from our room was of a derelict building strewn with mattresses and rubble. Substantial building work was under way around the hotel resulting in dirty muddy pavements and roads at the entrance to the hote. This is something I think we should have been made aware of by the travel company handling our booking The hotel reception were very understanding explained that the hotel was full for the next 2 nights but agreed to change our room to a different room for the remainder of our stay. Our second room was not much bigger than the first with a tiny wardrobe certainly not capable of containing 2 peoples clothes. It was overlooking a street where a JCB was working on road improvements which meant it was extremely noisy. This hotel has very poor noise proofing between rooms and we found it exetrmeley noisy offering little opportunity for rest and relaxation. Since my return I have seen similar comments about the size of the rooms and the hotels response about them being budget or special offer rooms and that people should pay for an upgrade if they want a better room. However I feel that a 4 star hotel should have a minimum standard of room and I feel that these rooms fall short of this. On the plus side the position of this hotel is excellent, the rooms were cleaned on a daily basis to a very high standard and the roof top terrace restaurant had amazing views over the city.

Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in Istanbul for a day or so you will appreciate how well placed the Ipek Palas is.

Fifteen minutes in the opposite direction takes you to the Grand Bazaar and the smaller Spice Bazaar. There have been contrasting reviews of this hotel on Tripadvisor, my overall impression was that that the Ipek Palace was a nice place to stay and provided excellent value for money. The staff were warm and welcoming and the hotel was spotless and well managed. Several reviewers have commented that a four star rating is a little generous and I would agree that overall it is more typical of a European three star hotel. Other reviewers have claimed noisy building works in the vicinity interrupted their sleep. While there were building works nearby, I did not find noise to be a problem although they were an obvious eyesore. My main, or should I say my only criticism of the hotel, would be the standard of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceconomy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms which tended to be tiny. Certainly more two star than four star, although there are rooms of a better standard available. All the mod cons are there such as air conditioning and a decent en suite but the room itself was small and quite basic. The hotel has a bar and restaurant, neither of which were very busy. Step outside the hotel and there is a vast choice of bars, shops and eateries in the area who will tout for your custom in a persistent and sometimes irritating manner. I found the standard of food to be generally quite mediocre with virtually every restaurant offering the same choices.

The Hotel Ipek Palas is very central, and within easy walking distance of the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Castle; and to the tram to visit other areas of Istanbul. There are major renovations happening behind the hotel, but this is not too much of an issue. On the same block as the hotel is a Mosque, and various characterful local chai shops where you can while away and hour or so and it feels like a real local neighbourhood place, despite being so central. The rooms in the hotel are of varying size - the hotel is a triangular building, much like the prow of a ship. Consequently, some double rooms are tiny, while others at the same price are more than generous in their size. We asked to change from a smaller room after the first night, given that my wife was pregnant, and this was not an issue. The staff are, generally, extremely friendly and helpful - which we found most people to be during our stay. I wouldn't say they try to 'upsell' you more than anywhere else in the tourist areas to eat in their restaurant. It would be fair to say that more has been invested in 'front of house' than in the upkeep of some of the rooms. We had other relatives and friends staying in the hotel for the wedding, so saw a variety of rooms - and many had loose sockets, wobbly bathroom fittings, and in the case of one room, a sharp edge on a safety catch on the door where this had been snapped by a previous guest. This did actually tear the cloth of my suit jacket - a problem for which, to their eventual credit, the hotel reimbursed me following some correspondence with them. For all this, this is a good value hotel - in terms of the room rates and generous inclusive breakfast which fuels you for a day exploring Istanbul.

The weather was gorgeous and it was out first visit to Istanbul so thankfully we were out and about most of the time and only came back to freshen up or sleep. We booked this as a Top Secret Hotel deal on lastminute, and as we were told the star rating, amenties etc we thought it was a pretty safe bet. We booked a Standard Room with Breakfast for 7 nights. On arrival I was a bit surprised by the amount of building/demolition work going on but thought, hoped, our room would be ok and we wouldnt notice it. When we were shown to our room, via an elevator that Im pretty sure should be a laundry chute rather than an elevator, we couldn't believe how small it was - once we put our suitcase down (luckily we just had the one!) one of us had to get onto the bed so the other could pass!!! I asked the porter if he sure this was a Standard room as opposed to an Economy room, he told us to ask at reception. We did, and we were told that there were infact rooms smaller than ours. I have to admit we had a sneaky peak around when the maids were cleaning and we never found one smaller but we were assured there were and we couldn't switch as the hotel was at full capacity. Then came the building works. Apart from the view from our room (third floor) looking directly at the demolition work we hoped that as we would be up and out early and back in the evening, that it wouldn't impact on our time there. I have to admit that for the first few days it was fine, but then, the last few nights before the end of our stay, we would come back from a lovely day out, in serious need of a sit down/sleep, to find bulldosers working with flashlights and torches in the dark, twice it was after 10pm and close to 11 when they finally stopped. Hardly what you'd expect on a relaxing break and not much point in making use of the rooftop restaurant!! I lay most of the blame with Lastminute, as if I had have booked this hotel the usual way I could have checked the reviews first. I really feel that lastminute should either remove this hotel from the Top Secret Hotel list until the building work around has been completed, or at least put a warning in somewhere before you commit to staying here.

The first room we were given was the ground floor right by the bar - it was also tiny + shabby, but the main issue was the obvious ensuing noise... we asked for an alternative and were told there was only one other room \"available to you\" which we took as at least it was on an upper floor away from the bar. The restaurant was directly over head so we were \"disturbed\" every morning, however the room comfort did not result in our wishing to lie in. To say our room did not resemble those featured is an understatement. The room was again very shabby, so much so I can't really confirm if it as clean or not (there were maids going into the rooms each morning though so I guess it probably was - just didn't look it). The primary issue however was that it was so small there was no space for a chest of drawers even - the bed was pushed up against the wall on one side (it had to be in order to provide space sufficient to open the door!). Ordaining to turn over resulted in my turning the wall light on. We both had to sleep on our sides anyway as the bed was essentially a large single - we only have a 4ft 6\" bed ourselves and no way was it that big. Every morning my back hurt - I would have slept on the floor in order to stretch out and lie on my back for a night, but there was literally not enough space to lie down there. Sometimes seeing really is believing. On a positive note, communal areas are clean, the bar area very chic / trendy (drinks a bit pricey but Istanbul is not as cheap as the rest of Turkey by any stretch), and the breakfast was fine, plus there was the promised roof-top view from the restaurant, although many other restaurants which we ate out in have the same or better.

The hotel website or the travel service we booked with did not mention that the room would not have sufficient space to swing a cat, and although the room was booked as an economy double I expected more from a 4 star hotel. The bathroom was impossible to manoeuvre in and two people in this room would be constantly bumping into each other. The view from the window was a hotel undergoing construction across the road.

I was advised on the best places to visit and also which areas i should dodge for safety reasons.

Unfortunately for us our room was overlooking the excavation sight next to the hotel.The noise of lorries being loaded with rubble well into the night was dreadful causing us to loose many hours sleep.Sadly for future Ipek Palas guests this looks likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The hotel is ideally placed for all the tourist attractions,the basement breakfast room was beautifully tiled and decorated and the choice and quality of the breakfast was excellent.We also had a lovely dinner in the terrace restaurant where the food and value for money was outstanding.

We were four friends, who wanted to stay in the same room. Inititally I booked a standard double as it was just me and a friend. After the booking, this increased to four all together, so I contacted the hotel and asked for an upgrade that had a balcony. I was told that only the family rooms had a balcony and that we would have to pay an additional 180 euros for the 6 night stay, which was fine. As we arrived at the hotel, I was disappointed with thesurrounding area, its quite claustrophobic and the construction site is about 5 meters away from the entrance. The hotel lobby was quite nice, and as we walked in, the bel boy insisted that he take our luggage. He grabbed for two and broke the strap on both straight away! thanks! I then went to check in, and they looked a little confused to see four people instead of two. I had of course printed off my emails with the hotel. I was informed that a family suite was not possible as it was based on 2 adults and 2 children. I didn't really care what it was based on as I had my confirmation, and we wanted a balcony! The senior member of staff (dont remember his name) looked quite irritated at the staff who had confirmed this, and asked if we would prefer to have the largest suite in the hotel that caters for 8 people, he said it was the best and that it was in our best interest. after a while, we agreed as it seemed there was no choice, but that room had no balcony. (This worked out better actually, as the balcony is tiny, so you cannot actually sit out on it, or stand as there is a flower box that takes up all the space, no pont at all!) we were taken up, and it was a nice room, spacious. Four girls, a lot of space, but one toilet/shower room, which we thought for such a big room was rather daft. The hotel itself is located in a great place, walking distance to everything. The service is good at first, but gets so annoying after your first day. One of my friends is Turkish so could speak the laguage (thank god!) It seemed that one of the staff (a manager I think) took a liking to her and would just not get the message and get lost! He is soooo unbelievably irritating. I don't know his name, but if you go there, trust me you will know him straight away, he just hangs around way too much. the breakfast is not on the roof terrace as stated, its in the basement, but still nice. It's an ok breakfast, but most of the time, they ran out of the bread and hot dishes. but have a great fruit selection. On out last day, they kept turning the lights on and off whilst people were still eating (breakfast ends at 10:30, it was about 10:35), we thought this was very rude, just let your guests finish up in peace! You get hassled everyday to attend their dinners and entertainment night, but we had learnt a trick to avoid this...run! The room service was good when they did clean the room. If you plan on leaving the room late, then make sure to tell the reception staff you want your room cleaned, else it wont get done, this was very disappointing, as we expected that if we are leaving at 13:00, housekeeping would still be around? So if you are planning a late night, do inform the staff you want your room cleaned the next day! There are many restaurants surrounding the hotel, and they all want you to eat there. it's funny at first how they all try to get you to say yes. If I'm honest, the best food we had was the vendors by the Bosphorous, fresh fish in a bun, was delicious!!! and about 10 times cheaper than the restaurants! you need to try the seafood! The hotel also has wi-fi and a computor for guest use (just one, which is always in use...and only of the net is actually working!) We also met a fellow guest on his last night who was moaning about that male staff member who had said quite a number of inappropriate things to him as he was travelling with two girls, one being \"are they your harem girls\". He was annoyed and offended at this statement and what was the need to state this? once the staff member had realised that we couldn't stand him (he has short black hair, about 5' 7\" and the most irrititating voice), he started to back off a little, though this took the length of our stay! The beds were very comfy, which was the reason why we couldn't get out of bed early after a late night! Istanbul at night looks so beautiful, so it's hard to go back to the hotel. You always get offered free drinks and food and desserts, try it! the apple tea was my fav! If you go to the grand bazar, dont bother buying anything, its so expensive, and you'll find that the local areas sell the same items for much cheaper! sometimes half the price. Overall, Istanbul was fab, I will defo go back. I wouldn't however stay at Ipek Palas...although our room was fine, it was pure luck that we got that room, and second time round I would not pay for it, as it would be a lot more than what we paid! It certainly is not four/five star, I would say it's more a good 3 star stay. If you do stay there though, only go if you get a good discounted price, else, dont bother!

The Ipek has been very tastefully renovated to reflect it Ottoman heritage. Interestingly this building has been an Hotel since it 1st opened its doors in 1889, and they current owners have made great efforts to capture this wonderful heritage. Therefore if you are visiting Istanbul to get a taste of Turkish and Ottoman History, this Hotel is definitely recommended for you! There is free wifi which works well enough, the breakfast is wonderful and we also tried the top floor restaurant which has spectacular views over the Bosphorus and Golden Horn. Free entertainment from a belly dancer and wonderful food with a 20% discount, make this restaurant comparable in price to other street eateries in the area. The only down side is that as this is such an old Hotel, the rooms are quite small - there is not much space to hang clothes up etc. However, the location is excellent - near to all the best sites, so you probably won't want to spend lots of time in the room!! Also there is construction work going on still, on the Underground vent right next to the Hotel. Our room was on the opposite side, and we found it was of minimal annoyance - but having read some of the other reviews, it is probably worth making sure you are not on the wrong side of this Hotel!

We asked for a room away from the construction works \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was clean, small but comfortable and tastefully decorated, with a desk, a coffee table and a sofa. Most importantly, everything worked with no problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c warm shower, air con, TV, Wi-Fi etc... plus the hairdryer and the safe, neither of which we used, really, but they worked! There was a mini-bar as well. The windows were double-glazed. All in all, a comfortable place to be when not out seeing the sights. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bar/lounge area downstairs, which serves drinks and snacks, and a computer which is handy for the internet, but they also have free Wi-Fi in the rooms. The breakfast room at the top has a panoramic view of Istanbul \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a great start to the day. There's a mixed buffet where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re bound to find something to your taste. Each morning the staff served something slightly different. All the staff there were friendly and helpful, quick to provide information on where to go and particularly Burcu, who seemed to have leaflets for everything! Would have taken a boat trip along the Bosphorus, but on the days we thought we might, it was pouring with rain, the only downside to our stay. Leaving the hotel, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy walk to some of the major sights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to Gulhane Park, and fairly easy to get to Aga Sofia, the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cistern etc. My partner had an injury and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk very far, so we found it convenient to be situated close to two tram stops, great for exploring the city, which is otherwise not that great for accessibility.

Location-wise, Ipek Palas gets a 10/10. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close enough to bars and restaurants without being on top of them; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a nice distance from the major attractions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a short walk, without being in the middle of the tourist crowd. The rooms were nothing to complain about, unless you plan on taking the kitchen sink with you! But what made it really were the staff. Warm, welcoming, and helpful. Worth contacting the hotel about airport transfers - we only did on the way back, and the car was reasonable, and prompt. The only thing the staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do was improve the weather outside, but we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold that against them.

Great breakfast & enough coffee to keep us walking all over Istanbul until at least 3-4pm before we need to rest. Central location for the old city and best parts of Istanbul. Tips before you go, Do book an airport transfer via Power Tour at 10 euros each way. Do get a good pocket guide as it makes cutting through all the back streets a must! Don't get lots of currency in the UK as you'll get a better rate from the million cash points in the city. Go to Tokapi Palace for 9am start as by 11am it's rammed full of large tourist groups. Don't take a Bosphorus tour at 35 euros, go down and take a local tour from the LEFT side of Galata bridge at 9 lira, not even \u00c2\u00a34 each for the same tour. Do take a turkish bath at Cagaloglu Hamami for 40 euros/80 lira for a complete bath service & massage as it is amzing and a must do! and its 5 mins from the hotel. Do go to the Islamic & Turkish art museum and the Bascilia Cistern. Do go to the Egyptian Spice Bazaar next to the New Mosque by Galata Bridge as it's much more fun & better value than the Garnd Bazaar. The best stall at the spice bazaar is No 49 UYGUN KIMYA, these guys are great & I went back 3 times, they'll do you a good deal if you but the most the 1st time you visit, your follow up purchases wil then be for peanuts! Do eat at Sarnic www.sarnicrestaurant.com it's in a deep cistern (like Bascalia), the food is amazing, the waiters brilliant and the ambience a true delight.

Check in was simple and friendly and nice welcome drink. It was a bit strange having a porter coming with us to our room, and he was explaining everything, but after 2 hours stuck in traffic on way from airport and being turfed off the bus a long way from the ferry port in the pouring rain, which had gone right through our cases, we just wanted to get our wet clothes out ! He was just doing his job though I suppose. I think the whole bellboy thing is a bit pretentious and was trying to make the hotel appear a lot posher than it actually is. The view from our window was horrible, but they cant help that., there was a building being renovated and it became quite amusing watching them fill a lorry with rubble using a small spade. The bed was a very small double and the duvet wasnt wide enough. The mattress was really uncomfortable and basically worn out. None of the room doors seem to shut first time so we found we were regularly disturbed by people banging doors trying to get them to close. Getting in and out of the tiny shower was tricky, good job we're no bigger! The wireless internet didn't work on our floor after the first couple of days, we did report it but it remained not working, but theres 2 computers in the reception so although a bit annoying wasnt the end of the world. The room was very small and not much storage space and not many tv channels, and for some reason the speech and lip synch was completely out on all channels. We would have liked to have had an occasional drink in the bar, but the bar area was freezing cold, and rarely occupied, probably because of the cold.

The hotel kindly arranged transport for me from the airport which I'm grateful for because even though the hotel is very close to the station, it would have been a nightmare trying to navigate the city streets otherwise (the hotel is in a backstreet and seems to be surrounded by construction sites). First impressions were good; the reception area was what one would expect for a 4 star hotel and I was offered a welcome drink and some useful local advice although I detected an element of promoting the services of local tour operators. I did feel somewhat irritated that the hotel porter insisted on accompanying me to the room to give me \"important information\" - ie how to use the minibar, order room service and switch on the TV, completely unnecessary. The room I was guided to was indeed a single as expected, but was incredibly small and the damp smell from the bathroom was immediately obvious. As soon as the porter left me I asked reception to upgrade me - not because of the room size but the bathroom which I did not even enter - which they did obligingly. The next room was marginally larger with a 3/4 size double bed but was furnished to the same standard as the previous, \"faded opulence\" would be a flattering description and shabby more accurate. The room was however very clean and when I eventually went to bed that evening I was surprised at how comfortable the bed was. However you can hear every sound in adjoining bedrooms - the laminate flooring contributed to this - and also interestingly all bathroom activity related to room ABOVE you! The simple explanation for this was a grid-like celing in the bathroom allowing all the pipework (including the sewer drain from the toilet ) to be both visible and audible. The external construction and sounds from the mosques were also evident during the day and night and the room could get uncomfortably hot without any means of adjusting the temperature other than opening a window. The bathroom was spacious enough with the exception of the shower which was 2'x2' max. This would have made it impossible for anyone with a BMI>30 to use, and I also struggled with this because of my height. With no shelf in the shower, my precariously balanced shampoo and conditioner fell to the bottom and was difficlut to retrieve without physically stopping the shower and opening the corner doors - any tall person would have difficulty in bending down to reach the shower tray within the small space. The shower itself was very powerful but the overhead bracket did not hold the shower in position properly. Breakfast was included in the price and was plentiful but not particularly tasty. Much of it was processed, no fresh fruit but fresh tomatoes and cucumber were available daily, as were olives , cheeses, meats, boiled eggs and a couple of hot dishes which varied daily. Fresh OJ is squuezed to order and charged extra. There was also a huge selection of carbs on offer (breads in various guises although nothing with bits in it that a northern European might relish), cereals were limited to generic cornflakes and a chocolate puff offering designed to appeal to children. I found myself enjoying the cornflakes and the people watching. LMDC calls the hotel \"very nice\" and based on the standard of the reception area I would agree, however the rooms are of variable quality. A quick scan of the fire exit route tells you all you need to know about room sizes - but be warned that x05 on any given floor is always the tiniest and x06 the most spacious. Later in the week I noticed that the larger rooms were furnished better. I am used to staying in much better hotels and have to say that I didn't feel particularly safe in the hotel at first because of it's location and standard of accomodation, and resolved to spend that first afternoon securing an alternative. The room did however have a safe which gave me some confidence and I then realised quickly that day that old Sultanhamet is a maze, most hotels are also located in what appear to be unmarked alleyways regardless of the standard of hotel. It's just the way it is in the old part of the city, handy for the main historic sites and safe for single females but presents huge hazzards to those with mobilty restrictions because of the poor condition if some of the streets. Like Istanbul, the Ipek Palas Hotel is an acquired taste and to my amazement grew on me. I can't complain for the price I paid but that would certainly not have been the 90Euro pn single room rate the hotel advertises at reception. IMO a hotel should offer a certain standard of environmental comfort to be awarded 4* rather than because of a mini-bar, for example.

Really pretty and nice reception. First problem is that it's surrounded by 2 building sites at the moment, and they are very noticiable.

We had the 6th floor, but the real 6th floor is for the restaurant, so it's like an annex that feels like another building that was added after (we could glance some of what we thought would be the \"nice\" rooms and they were even smaller and looking the same way than ours) The corridor had badly folded rugs that are a serious hazard (I can trip on flat floors!) but we thought they were cleaning. We later learned that it wasn't the case. The doors of the rooms have a big space on the upper and lower sides, making it very easy to hear anything from the rooms next door, and there was very apparent plaster behind the radiator and under the window. The toiletries were laughable (ear buds, a shower cap and a smal bottle of shower gel) and they were never replenished. There was not even a single shelve in the shower and the doors wouldn't close properly. And the towels were changed only if they were obviously dirty (like with make up or stuff like that). They had tried to make the walls pretty with some nice wallpaper. Shame one strip was in one direction and the other one upside down. No tea/coffee making facilities and only one single plug in the whole room that you have to share with the TV and the mini bar (another thing that was never replenished and we had to buy our cokes in the shop around the corner). And we are 99.5% sure our bed sheets were not changed in the 5 days we were there. These are just some of the reasons that come to my mind (if you go, pay attention to the wallpaper in the restaurant, it's legendary) but there were more.

They would talk loudly together, so very noisy from just before 8am and can be noisy until 10pm in the evening. Only other gripe about the hotel is the radiator in the bathroom was not working which meant that if we closed the door to the bathroom area to try and shut out the noise from the staff, the bathroom became very cold.

The reception from the TV was very poor so not watchable but we were not in the room much so not really a problem. There is a free safe in the room and a fridge. The staff were very helpful, particulalry in the restaurant where the restaurant manager, Ertugrul and the waiter, Emin, could not do enough for you. They certainly went beyond what would normally be expected. We had an evening meal in the restaurant which was very tasty, plentiful and cheap! Breakfast was good - yoghurts, fruit salad, eggs, a variety of breads, cheeses, ham, cereal, etc. There is cherry juice squash or water along with the coffee and tea but if you want freshly squeezed orange juice or pomegrante juice (lovely) it is 5 turkish lira extra. Went to the Grand Bazaar which, compared to other shops in Istanbul, can be more expensive. The spice (Egyptian) Bazaar is where you can get spices, teas, turkish delight, shawls, oils and perfumes galore. The Artisan Bazaar was a more civilised area, more sedate.

There was one computer available for guests, but there was usually always someone waiting. The location is fine, although it is a 15-20 minute walk to the main tourist areas (Topkapi Palace, Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar). However, it only a 5 minute walk to the Sirkeci train and light rail station. This made going to Istiklal very convenient in the evenings. Istanbul's light rail is great, and I highly recommend that you take advantage of the light rail and the ferries. On the Sunday we were there, they had a 10K race through the city and they closed the light rail. We were going to Dolmabahce Palace so we ended up taking the ferry to the Asia side, then another ferry to the north. Don't pay for a cruise on the Bosphorous, when you can take the ferry for TL1.50. The breakfast offered was a weak point. Although it looks like a lot of food, upon closer inspection, it's not very appetizing. There are cereals and breads, but the eggs were very runny. I did not eat very much breakfast. If I go to Turkey again, I would look for another hotel. Not that there was anything wrong with this hotel, I just think I could do better.

The 6 days I spent at Ipek Palas were enjoyable and most pleasurable. Your hospitality had been proven to be very beneficial for myself.

As having been mentioned in previous reviews, think carefully about choosing a room here as the standard doubles are very small and you can probably find a larger room for the same price elsewhere. We went for Ipek Palace having been offered a very good last minute rate and knowing we wouldnt be spending too much time in our room anyway. So how small you ask? Very small. And the bathroom was tiny, it was an amusing experience fitting in and out of the minature shower cubicle each day. The double bed was a manageable size but very hard in places and sagging in others, we left with a few aches and pains at the end of our stay! Apart from the size, the room was very clean and furnishings all in good condition. There was a powerful air conditioning system and television. We had clean towels and fresh sheets every day without fail. The decor of the rest of the hotel is a pretty good standard, with a nice lobby and the top floor restaurant has a brilliant view out across the bosphorus. The breakfast (included in price) had a wide variety to choose from, savory and sweet, something to keep adults and even fussy children happy. Definitely fill up on the breakfast before embarking on your adventures around Istanbul. I wouldnt advice eating in the restaurant for other meals however as the food was not up to standard, and you can find much better for the same price or less elsewhere. The hotel staff were nice and spoke reasonable english. We were welcomed with a complimentary drink and discussed our stay with the hotel manager who was very helpful. Be warned that the hotel is currently next to a building site and during the daytime quite a lot of drilling can be heard from across the road, so siestas at the hotel might not be too relaxing. Also the hotel is in the thick of it, so traffic noise can be heard quite easily. This stops around 6pm though, so as long as you stay out all day, you'll miss it.

Taxi's are cheap and plentyfull - it only cost us 30tl from the airport to the hotel and was a 30 minute ride. All have meters, and taxi's do not expect tips but are very grateful if you do. The breakfast which is on the top floor of the hotel has good views of the city and gives a good selection of food for guests - the fruit salad was wonderful - but you had to pay 5tl for freshly squeezed orange juice- lots of other places sold it for much less. The air conditioning though was inadequate as Istanbul was very hot in July as you can imagine - and retreating to your room to cool down was not an option. The air con did work but was inadequate - we kept it on all night but the room still did not cool down at all. We would have loved to go back to our room more often out of the heat, but only the reception area had adequate air conditioning - even the bar area was too hot to relax and drink - so we went to other bars instead. Overall our hotel was good and well worth what we paid for our weeks holiday - aftercare is not good though as I left something in our room and emailed the hotel twice asking them if they found my item - and to date I still have not received a response, so I dont suppose that will be returned to me. I am happy to pay postage if they would return it, but with no response what can you do?? The lady manger was always in reception every morning at her desk on her computer thought, so I dont know why she is not replying? It would have been nice to have the option of hiring a portable fan in our room - after all its worth paying extra to be comfortable - perhaps the hotel will bear this in mind - its lovely to go back to your room and relax - all we could do was take a cool shower 4-5 times a day to cool down.

However, we were very pleasantly surprised on entering the large and pleasant reception area from our taxi, which had been efficiently arranged by the hotel to fetch us from the airport. After the formalities and cool complimentary cocktail (non alcoholic) hit the spot. We were shown to our room by a helpful porter who spoke passable English. (In fact all the staff seemed quite at home in English) Our room was adequately sized with a reasonable bathroom, but one minor criticism is the the lack of drawer space - actually none - so every thing had to be left in the bags or put on a single shelf in the wardrobe. Our room looked out onto the street, and we were worried about the level of traffic noise - Turkish drivers seem to have the horn in use the moment there is any hold-up longer than 5 seconds! However the double glazing and air conditioning were both reasonably efficient and caused us no real trouble. I think the quality and range of the breakfast buffet is the best I have ever seen in a hotel of this price. We used the enclosed top floor terrace style restaurant only once for dinner during our visit and have no complaints there either. All the staff were very pleasant and friendly and arranged a trip by boat on the Bosphorous for us - no trouble at all. I think this hotel is good value for money, and I would certainly use it again.

I booked after reading excellent reviews on Tripadvisor, but we are really quite disappointed. Mixed experience overall. The double room was tiny, and there was hardly any room to turn around in the crammed shower room. It was particularly noisy at night, as windows were single glazed and there was busy traffic passing the hotel. The closed doors left relatively a wide gap so the motion-activated light from the corridor outside shone through into the room as soon as someone walked past. Luckily we were able to switch to a different room, and the other room was better. Note that not all rooms look like the ones they show on the website! Don't expect too much from breakfast either, particularly if you are into western style breakfasts. Luggage security is pretty poor. We left our luggage with the hotel, there was no labelling system, and they just asked guests to identify their own luggages, in fact you don't have to give identification to prove that you are staying at the hotel - that's rather a lot of trust! Overall basic but clean. Location is really excellent though.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tashkent, Uzbekistan", "Title": "\u201cWe'll DEFINATELY stay here again\u201d", "Author": "impossible2impress", "ReviewID": "UR22686818", "Content": "The experience was absolutely great right from the begining (when I started making a hotel booking via hotel web site) until I left to the airport (with complementary transportation from Ipek Palace). To be honest, I can't think of anything that did not satisfy my picky needs; 1. the hotel staff were very eager to assist in any way they could 2. the room was cleaned on a daily basis. Considering that I stayed in Ipek Palace during cold month - the room heater was working well, which made my sleep even better. 3. the breakfast was basic, but very delicious. In the evening, it was nice to have a glass of wine with fruit platter in the hotel restaurant on the 6th floor. Note: they have a good turkish wine selection. I would recomend this hotel to all the travellers: young couples, families, single travellers and etc. Special thanks to Mr.Muslum for always being there.
