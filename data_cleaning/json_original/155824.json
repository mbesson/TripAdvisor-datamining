We were greated with an ice cold cocktails and check in took less than 5 minutes. Our room, 439, was amazing. Full view of the ocean, balcony and you could see the sunrise each morning. We have to send an extra special thank you to Mr. Arturo, Front Desk Manager for giving us the most amazing hotel room that we have ever stayed in. How do we begin to thank Carlos Medina, Public Relations. At the end of each day Carlos would look for our group of nine and ask how our day was. We would tell Carlos every night.... it was a day in heaven. Carlos went above and beyond his job description. Carlos holds a special place in our hearts. Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... Dream day at the Playacar Palace.... Start the day with a walk on the white sand beach that goes on forever. The warm oceanwater, blue turquoise water and warm morning sun on your body. Time for breakfast...mimosa, latt\u00e9 and amazing breakfast buffet that changed each day. Pool time... unlimited yummy drinks, the smell of BBQ in the air. Hamburgers, steak, chicken breast, french fries, pizza, hot dogs by the pool. Also a full lunch buffet inside if you wished to get out of the sun. If you still could not decided what to eat, just ask for whatever you craved. Pico de galo, chips, shrimp and scallops... Chicken wings... Excellent music playing in the background. Slow and relaxing in the early morning and then rocking fun in the afternoon. Entertainment Staff that made the day so fun. Acquasize, yoga on the beach, volleyball, trivia games by the pool or just taking the time to visit with everyone. Pool bartenders and servers that love to have fun with you. Make you any drink you can think of. You would never wait to get asked if you want a drink or get a drink. The service was the same on the beach too. Dinner.... All the restaurants and buffetf for dinner are wonderful. Our favorite was the Italian restaurant. The menu has many options and the ambience of the restaurant is perfect. If you are looking for a place to have dinner that has excellent food, not rushed and impecable service... this is the place to go. You do not need reservations at any of the restaurants. We loved this feature. We would all meet in the Lobby bar or Luna Lounge for drinks. When everyone would arrive we would make our way to the restaurant. It was so relaxing and no one had to be on a schedule. Luna Lounge Time.... Casino night, salsa dance lessons or just relaxing. Visiting with family and new friends that we met on our holiday. Resort Credits... My advice is that you try to decide what you would like to spend your resort credits on prior to your arrival to the resort. We met with a Playacar Palace employee on our first morning. She was explaining in detail what we could do with our credits. We had received a detailed list of what we could use our credits for prior to arrival. We were able to inform her of what we would like to do in approximately 5 minutes. This saved time for her and ourselves. With our Resort Credits we received a romantic steak and lobster dinner on the beach, swam with the dolphins, professional pictures on the beach, two tequilla gift sets from the gift shop and my Husband went golfing. Enriqu\u00e9 Iglesias Concert.... During our stay we were also treated with an Enrique Iglesias concert that was provided by the Playacar Palace Resort. They had a coach bus that took us to the Moon Palace Resort Golf Course in Cancun. Enriqu\u00e9 Iglesias performed outdoors on the golf course. It was a perfeft night. Warm, full moon and Enriqu\u00e9 Iglesias. Heaven... I think so! The concert is on utube... watching the video brings back so many wonderful memories for us. When we returned to the Playacar Palace Resort at approximately midnight the resort had a buffet waiting for us in the outdoor lobby. It made us feel so welcome and as if we were at home. This resort thinks of everything. Waiters also there taking our drink orders. One word... amazing. I hope that after reading our reivew that you agree.... A day at the Playacar Palace is like a day in heaven. We would go back in a heartbeat. Thank you again to all the staff at Playacar Palace. There are just too many staff to name them all individually. They all hold a special place in our hearts. You all are amazing and you made our trip.... a dream come true.

A number of the staff remembered us from 2 years ago, which made us feel very welcome. We are Palace members and we went to the Sun Palace last year, which we also loved, but the location of this resort just cannot be beat. It is fantastic to be so close to 5th Avenue, and to be able to walk into town to stroll 5th Avenue every night after dinner. The resort staff were extremely friendly and always attentive - we never had to chase anyone down to ask for anything - they were always right there whenever we needed anything, and always offered to carry things for us, to take our towels when we were finished with them, etc. The spa was good (not as good as the spa at Sun Palace), but since they are currently building the spa and gym right on the premises, we think it will make this resort only that much better! We love that this is a smaller resort - it has a much more quaint and personal feel to it. The food was good but we have recommended that the resort put in one more a la carte restaurant - when it's busy, the Cafe del Mar is buffet in the evenings as well so we didn't go there for dinner (the breakfast and lunch buffets were very good and had a huge variety of food! but we didn't want to do buffet for dinner). That meant we only had a choice of 2 restaurants for dinner. Surprisingly, we went to the Oriental restaurant 3 times because we liked it more than the Italian restaurant (although the quality of the food and presentation at the Italian restaurant has definitely improved since the last time we were there in August 2010). We will definitely be going back to this resort!

This was my first time in Mexico and I think we picked the right place. I read about 50 of these reviews to do my research. If you're into decent buffet food, great beach and pool, exceptional service, and a central location, then you should really consider this resort. Located next to Senior Frogs (who cares) and the ferry to Cozumel (only worth going to scuba or snorkel) this Palace resort is right on the beach and a short walk to the shopping areas. They have golf, a spa, and a new looking gym, but these are all located off-site where a van does a shuttle every 15 minutes. The resort is kid friendly, but while we were there it was mostly 30's, 40's and 50's year old's. The reviews that said to book the amenities right away were correct. They fill up quickly. You can only use a limited amount of resort credits on the spa, but unlimited on almost everything else, including golf. Most of the excursions seemed more for families. We did use some credits for a wine upgrade, but that selection could use some improvement. During our stay the resort was doing some construction during the day. No big deal, since why would anyone spend their beach vacation in the room during the day? The pool and beach are way too nice for that and there are plenty of shaded places to relax. (Unless you are hung over in the room....noise was quite loud at times.) The buffet food was better than expected. Also vegetarian friendly. The resort was very clean with an army of people working constantly both in cleaning and guest service. Remember to bring a bunch of dollar bills for tips. We would leave a dollar or two at each meal (a little more at the sit down restaurants) and would also tip the housecleaning ladies each day. The bartenders and waitresses give such great service that you'll want tip money, even though the materials say gratuities are included. Oh, and don't forget about 24 hour room service. The drive from the airport is about 45 minutes. The room was decent size and I think all have in-suite hot tubs. Our balcony had a decent view from the 5th floor.

We even went over to Moon Palace during our stay at Playacar and their food wasn't half as tasty as Playacar's. The Italian restaurant, Terrazza, was exceptionally delicious, and Angel there was quite an awesome host/manager.

The rooms were always very well kept and the maid service was exceptional. 5th ave. offers quite the variety of shopping and cuisine. It is great that it is all right at your finger-tips. The golf course was, I thought, well kept compared to many others I've played in the area. They had the best greens and fairways than any golf course I've been to in that area. The spa was awesome! I think those having a wedding there sometimes have the notion that they will be receiving some extra-special treatment just because. What they fail to realize is that they are not the only ones there trying to have a special time and the staff can't just ignore all the rest of the people there.

I had expressed my displeasure in my survey, as well as by sending a formal letter to Playacar Palace. It was ignored. As a result, I am now posting my candid review (that had the resort initially responded to me, I would have acknowledged they made good). (Not to readers, scroll through posts from others during the end of Dec \u2013Jan time frame who will offer a similar review) I will start by saying that the staff of this resort makes it remarkable. Everyone; from the groundskeepers to the beach towel staff to the people we usually take more notice of \u2013bartenders, guest services, front desk\u2026are absolutely exceptional. After our experience it has become obvious however that the executive management of Palace Resorts however takes both their \u2018non VIP\u2019 guests and their staff for granted. During our wedding guest(s) stay, our comfort and use of facilities was completely compromised by Playacar Palace\u2019s catering to Colin Cowie ( Ironically, a D-List celebrity/wedding and event planner) and his guests. I am astounded that Palace resorts would allow one group to take over the resort and infringe upon other paying guests. As I was hosting a wedding reception at the Playacar Palace I was made aware of the specific rules that applied to having outdoor events/receptions. It was made very clear to me that under no circumstances could we have events outside beyond 10 pm. (presumably due to disturbing other guests) It\u2019s obvious this rule was neither applied or enforced for Mr. Cowie.One evening they had a beach part that lasted until 1 in the morning with the soundsystem and speakers facing the resort. We did not sleep that evening and the next day was certainly not relaxing as we were tired. On New Year\u2019s Eve, their outdoor dance party (DIRECTLY BELOW MY BALCONY) began at 11:30 and lasted until about 4 am. We were also treated to dismantling of this dancefloor at around 7:30 in the morning on January 1st. It\u2019s unfortunate that both my husband and I, and other paying guests paid for an upgrade for an ocean view suite but in fact were the ones that suffered the most from this group and their private events. I was also very disappointed with how guests who were not in Mr. Cowie\u2019s party were treated for New Year\u2019s Eve festivities. We had the dismal choice of having dinner and celebrations in either the corporate meeting room adjacent to the gift shop or the cramped sports bar. Even the landing outside of the lobby bar was closed off, so that Mr. Cowie and his guests could enjoy cocktails prior to their dinner. Guests eventually stopped complaining at the front desk, as it was made clear the very first night we were all so horrified, that their hands were tied and nothing would be changed. I have stayed at the resort when other sizeable corporate groups were in attendance and we never suffered any inconvenience. I believe that Palace resorts and the Playacar Palace made unreasonable exceptions for Mr. Cowie and his group and gave absolutely no thought or concern how this would affect other PAYING GUESTS of the hotel during this time. This completely compromised our vacation and embarrassed us in front of other guests we encouraged to book there for our wedding. I have noticed the General Manager Mr. Malacar responding to some of the posts...it's curious that in a public forum you're only to eager to respond, but when I have sent both a letter and filled out 2 satisfaction reviews (at the resort and the one sent to me online after our wedding) there has been no response at all.

It was at about 50% capacity. When we arrived on Tuesday, 2/28, the resort was full. In fact, they told us that it was over-booked. This is our 3rd time visiting a Palace Resort (we are NOT Palace Members) so we expected a room with a view. They placed us in a 1st level room across from the construction zone. While the room itself was nice, it was extremely noisy and there was no view of the ocean. In their defense, Arturo, the reservations manager offered to move us to the Moon Palace and give us an ocean-front room. We declinced because my husband had golf reservations already booked along with transportation. Also, my girlfriend and I wanted to walk into town and walk the beach while our husbands were golfing (that's not an option at the Moon Palace). SERVICE: - Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!! Every single person at the resort is pleasant and so very helpful. They treat their guests well and interact and have fun. This is one of the reasons I really like Palace resorts. FOOD: - Generally, AI food is just \"Okay\". The variety at the Palace is vast. We particuarly liked the Japenese restaurant and used our points for the lobster dinner. While they say that the Italian and Japanese restaurant require long pants for the men, they didn't enforce it. No dress-code was required and we saw lots of shorts and tee-shirts in the evenings. DRINKS: - Seemed a little watered down but the wine is fabulous. I particuarly liked their Chardonnay and fell in love with a particular red (brought a cork home to see if my local liquor store can order it). POINTS: - We received $1500 per-room to use in various ways. We didn't use them for golf because they require you to book when you arrive. Instead, we upgraded the guys to a golf package and booked our unlimited golf in advance. - Because we've traveled to Playa close to a dozen times, we chose not to do any of the excursions. Instead, we used our points for the lobster dinner and wine upgrades. They give you the option to use them at the spa as well but we just didn't get around to booking anything. FITNESS CENTER: - The fitness center/spa is about a mile south of the Palace in Playacar. They have daily shuttles or you can easily walk/run in less then 10 minutes. They are building a fitness center/spa on site (hence the construction zone). This is a smaller resort with 200ish rooms. They have one main activity in the evening but this resort pretty much shuts down around 10:00 p.m. It is not an adults only resort but there were very few kids both times we stayed here. It's within walking distance to 5th Ave so those that want more night life don't have to go far to find it. Given the resort was filled to capacity when we were there, the pool area tended to be pretty busy. The beach was lovely and there were plenty of chairs for everyone. Lots of \"towel-games\" happening as people would get up bright and early and reserve their spots. Overall: GREAT SERVICE, GREAT LOCATION and overall, GREAT resort.

We went into Playa del Carmen one night for dinner and loved the food in the town - a little pricey because we ate at a restaurand on 5th Avenue. Angel in the Luna Lounge was a wonderful bartender.

We were at the Playacar Palace from February 13th to the 20th. We had a fabulous time. My wife and I were at the Moon Palace last year and thought that we would try a smaller hotel this time. We loved the Moon but also love it here. Two different hotel but both are great. Check in was easy and fast when we arrived at 11:30am. We did not get our room (#328) until 3pm so we went for lunch and had a few cocktails while we waited. Great room location and view! Everything about this place was GREAT. We did not have an issue with anything, even WI-FI was great in the room. Don't know why the previous post had issues with Wi-Fi. Took the ferry over to Cozumel for a day and went to the Cozumel Palace. You can get a hospitality room for 30 minutes if you wish to shower and stay for dinner and then come back later. Book it at the front desk when you get there. We both had spa treatments and everything was great. My wife had her hair cut and colored using the resort credits and I went out and practiced my putting while I waited for her. Had a couple of drinks after she was finished and then took the shuttle back to the resort. The shuttle run every 15 minutes and it is very easy. I didn't play golf on this trip but I will bring my club next year and play 4 or 5 times. The course looked great and talking to people they said the same. It is tight...... We did not do and excursions except over to Cozumel that we did on our own. Food was excellent at every restaurant. Room was well kept through out the week. The only thing that I would like to mention is that I noticed that a lot of people did not leave tips. YES, you don't have to tip but the service is out of this world and you should tip because of this. They do not make a lot of money so a few dollars goes a long way. Personally, I leave the maid a couple of dollars each day, tip the pool staff, spa staff and waiters. I usually leave 5 dollars at dinner. I noticed a lot at dinner when people just get up after dinner and walk out without leaving a cent!!!! That is CHEAP. It might cost you $60 dollars for the week in tips. Bring small bills. Walking on 5th avenue was really nice. We met another couple from our city there and went and had drinks and appetizers with them. They were staying at another hotel and we found out 3 days before that they were going to Mexico also.

After much Tripadvisor reading, I decided on the Playacar Palace. I wasn't sure a smaller hotel would be enough for a week, but sooo, glad we did. First and foremost, I have to say the personnel at this hotel is outstanding. All the staff seem to truly enjoy working at the Palace, which showed in their attitude with the guests. We also could't go anywhere at this hotel without seeing someone cleaning, they really take care of the facilities. The location was great. I've stayed at other AI's and they're often a world of their own without easy access to outside diversions. Here, you're close so to much. Downtown is really great, you can walk out anytime you wish and enjoy the shopping, bars and restaurants.. Always felt safe. When staying in Playa Del Carmen you are closer to all the sightseeing activities then if you were in Cancun. That makes this location a plus. We were in a non-view room, but it was large, bright and clean. I thought I might take advantage of the resort credits to upgrade the room, but the hotel was full. So, if you really want a view, I'd say book the type of room you really want if it matters. The bathroom included a lighted vanity mirror which was a great plus for us ladies. The shampoo and such were top notch brands so plan to enjoy those. The bed and pillows are above average and we slept great. The food here was very good. We didn't have the buffet for dinner, but enjoyed breakfast and lunch. Everyday they also had a poolside grill with burgers and chicken. We did enjoy a burger more often than we should have (yummy when you pop into the buffet and add guacamole and pico!). We took advantage of credits and did the romantic dinner. As others have said, good with the credits, but wouldn't have actually wanted to 'pay extra'. The lobster was very good. We also participated in the Chef's dinner and enjoyed that also. All the other nights we eat at the Italian Rest. Since they changed the menu mid week there was a lot to enjoy and the food was top notch - the filet is fantastic. The alcohol selection was better than average. Pretty much any top shelf brand you wanted they had. The nightly entertainment was enjoyable. There weren't any big productions, they were either in the lounge area or poolside, but we ddi enjoyed each nightly. This resort is a pretty laid back, so not a lot of late night 'action' going on, but if you wanted some 'excitement' fun bars were only a short walk away. We took advantage of the credits to take a tour to Coba and the Dolphin experience. We had a great time on each. We did Xplor on our own and had a full day of fun. The pool and beach area were both very nice. Only downside aren't a lot chairs with umbrellas, so if you need shade during your day, you'll need to be out saving a little early or else be up near the buildings. Drink service at the pool was way above average, you didn't go without some type of beverage, if you so desired. You could walk the beach in either location for quiet a distance.

We would definitely return to Mexico and this hotel. Our only complaint was that on arrival (despite them knowing we were all booked for a wedding and the booking had been in place for 12 months) we were allocated rooms at the back of the resort overlooking a noisy building area. The bell boy told us people did not want to stay in those rooms but the hotel was full and they were using all rooms. We had a 24 hour battle to get moved - mainly to make sure the wedding couple were looked after as they had been promised a Superior Room. Eventually we were all moved but had to use Resort Dollars to bargain for sea views. We would know in future to use them again to do that as we would have not enjoyed our stay if we'd been at the back the whole time.

We stayed 8 days and enjoyed every bit of it. Last year we were so pleased with Cancun Palace that this year, it was a definite to come back to another Palace Resort... we just had to decide which one. After looking at the different options, we booked Playacar and also decided to become a member! I read many of the reviews and I will give you my opinion: This resort is a smaller (225 room) resort that has an open lobby. When you arrive, you will find that everyone is willing to please in any way that can to make sure that you are taken care of. We arrived at 12:30 and had to wait until 3pm to get our room (no big deal, we went for lunch and took care of meeting our representative). The room was a partial oceanview in the \"construction zone\" building. The noise didn't bother me even when I became ill one day and stayed in bed. I ordered room service that entire day and they were asking me if I needed anything else or to just let them know and they will get it. The pool is warm and the bar staff is great! I sat in the same area and the waitress knew me by name and exactly what to bring for the entire family! Her name was Bella..... EXCELLENT! She worked so hard to please us and whenever she would make a suggestion, it was great. I fell and hurt my toe (only my toe) and she was so worried that she had an emt come and look at me right on site! All I needed was a bandaid.... needless to say..... we were pampered. We found both the Italian and Japanese restaurants great... we would try things that we normally would never have tried. Our 14 yeAar old enjoyed the choices he was given and again, they knew what we were drinking and what our preferences were and how we liked our meats cooked.... very impressive! Thumbs up to Angel and Jazz. PS... if you go Japanese, ask Jazz to make his Banana dish for you! Entertainment..... Regarding entertainment... I found that Cancun Palace had a better selection but it was also due to the fact that they have a separate building just for their entertainment. However, the entertainers worked hard with the space that they had.... Gabriel was great and has many great dreams for Playacar Palace... Nightly entertainment.... If you have teenagers there may be times they may be bored. I shared this with the Palace. They have a beautiful Martini Lounge that is very slow. It would be great to see them put in a pool table and offer dinner/dancing in the room.... a teen night with a dj..... bingo night with the family one night...... \"spruce it up\" earlier than 10:30 pm. By the time 10:30 comes, I am tired and ready to retire to the room. Elvira was our representative. She was met us on our first day and took care of us throughout our stay. She is great at what she does! It would also be good to see more lounge chairs in the pool area. We would go down at 10:00 and could not get a chair..... please have Santa bring the Palace more lounge chairs. We spend a day in the spa and enjoyed ourselves. Everything was excellent! We also had Jesus (lobby) assist us everyday and greet us upon returning.... Thank you Jesus, you are great! My husband and son golfed in Playacar..... Thumbs up! We have been coming to Mexico for the past 7 years and stayed at 7 different hotels and we actually wanted to hear what the presentation. There was no pressure (other than one person) but at the end, we bought the package that was right for us. We didn't need 25 or 50 weeks and we ended up with 15 weeks and felt comfortable with what we bought. We look forward to visiting the palace hotels. I do wish we would have done it a year ago when Hard Rock was part of the membership however, we are pleased either way. If you like being pampered then this is the place for you.

We had a full ocean-view room (546). We were a bit disappointed that we couldn't see the sunrise , but overall the room and view were nothing short of spectacular. We went down there with 3 other couples. We played golf 4 days and really enjoyed the course. It was long (581 yard par 5, 455 yard par 4) with narrow fairways and lots of bunkers (lost a dozen balls on the first round). The beds were very comfortable. I didn't like that we could only spend $300 of our $1,500 credit on spa stuff. As the guys spent $800 of it playing golf, the ladies should have been allowed to spend as much as they wanted of the hotel credit on the spa. We ended up using $350 of the credits on a romantic lobster dinner on the beach. The meal was nice, but if i wasn't spending 'funny money', I would have been really disappointed. For $350 I had expected full lobsters, or at least a large cold water lobster tail (like a pounder). The lobster tail was maybe a little bigger than you'd get at Red Lobster. Again, the meal was good, but I had hoped for so much more. Luna Lounge was the place for us to hang out. There were rarely many people in there and our bartender Angel served us well. Keep on smiling Angel. The service was top-notch...everywhere (from room service to drinks at the pool to food being delivered to you on the beach). Thank you all! We had a bad experience in the Italian restaurant (took us 2 1/2 hours and we hadn't even reached our dessert yet), and finally ended up leaving the table. Don't get me wrong; the food was excellent, but it was wwwwwaaaaayyyyy slow. When I was walking out, I happened to say something to the hostess. Low-and-behold, the hotel and restaurant managers found us the next day and apologized. Really...we were on the beach with tons of other people and they made a point to find us and talk. The service is obviously top-down. This was a great touch! It definitely made up for the bad experience in the restaurant the night before. The beach was incredible. There were a lot of kids running around. We were there to get away from little ones and having them constantly around was a little downer, but it's a family resort, so i guess it is was it is...

Many of the reviews and brides I have spoken to have had wonderful things to say about the weddings at Playacar Palace. I hope this is true, because it has been a nightmare dealing with the staff in Miama. Everytime I talk to someone I get a different answer. I'm terrified to end up in Playa del Carmen with a whopping bill and horrible service, because of lack of communication between the Miami offices and Playacar Palace.

At one point my family members who had booked the Presidential Suite were told their room was given away! It would be nice if the staff at Playacar Palace and the staff in Miama had more communication with each other. While this is not anyone at Playacar's fault, it's unfortunate that our experience starts off on such a bad note due to poor staff in Miami.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "annandale, va", "Title": "\u201cBest Food, Best Drinks, Best Service\u201d", "Author": "LL_in_NoVa", "ReviewID": "UR125051492", "Content": "This is my second trip in a year to this part of Mexico and fourth All Inclusive I've been to. This had the best food, best service, and best drinks of all four. Playacar Palace Pros: The above items were really great (I felt guilty leaving the resort), location right next to downtown Playa del Carmen (unlike any other resort I've been to), close by attractions (ferry to Cozumel and diving, Mayan ruins, water parks, etc.) So-so: You had to take a shuttle to the Spa (leaves every 15 minutes for a 3-5 minute ride), but Spa was very clean (wife liked it; weight room had 6 cardio machines, full set of dumbbells and some other machines overlooking golf course). Golf course was beautiful (rental clubs will set you back $50 a round). Getting to a guest rep to sign up for resort credits was a pain as there was always a line. They should make the list easy to read and get this system more automated. It took an hour to sign up for anything. We enjoyed the lobster/champagne dinner on the beach, Dolphinarius (really neat except the part about the captive dolphins (call me an enabler)), golf and lots of wine upgrades. Not so hot--Food is really good at this resort, but you can skip the Japanese place. Average, americanized oriental food and subpar sushi. The Banana's Flambe was spectacular however! This trip was not great for my spoiled 11, 12 adn 14 year old. Not enough for them to do. For that reason, I recommend this resort highly for childless groups, groups with children under 7, those staying only 3 or 4 days, and those who can play in a pool and at the beach for days on end without getting bored.

We went there because my wife\u2019s sister was getting married there that week. In the past we had stayed at the Moon Palace and it was huge and a bit expensive. We felt for us the Moon Palace was too big and was a bit turned off by the number of people and the largeness of the whole place. So when we heard we were going to PlayaCar Palace I was not that excited thinking that we would be just another person in the crowd. We were going to be in for a surprise!!! We arrived to Playacar Palace and was immediately greeted with a drink and was brought over to a desk where we could sit down during check-in. This was different. Ok\u2026 Then we got the treatment\u2026 Mr. Bell this and Mrs. Bell that and we want you to enjoy your vacation\u2026 Welcome to Playacar Palace!!! We was informed that our room was not ready\u2026 but when you get there 4 hours early.. What are we to expect. They held our bags and sent us off to eat and drink. What a small, beautiful, friendly place. When we got back to finalize the check-in, they had upgraded our room to a full view of the beach. Nothing but sun, sand, water and beautiful sunrises. The bartenders immediately recognized us as new people and asked us our names. That was the last time we had to tell them our name and what we drank. From all of the staff it was always\u2026 \u201cOur pleasure sir / mam\u201d Always a smile from the staff and you had to be fast to be able to say \u201cHola\u201d first. We never once waited for a drink\u2026 they was there first, asking if we wanted another. It seemed they always wanted to do more that you expected\u2026. And they did. We loved the food and enjoyed spending the $1,500 of credits they gave us. We went to the Spa for a Couples Massage, took an excursion. We had a Photo Session and, a chef\u2019s meal and a Romantic Meal on the beach\u2026 all included it the spending money. It all seemed so and was so personalized. What we loved mostly was the size of the resort, but you cannot take away for the beauty of the pool, the beach, restaurants, room and the location to Playa-Del-Carmen. It was one of the smallest we have stayed at, but was the most friendliest and accommodating. They seemed to always want to go out of their way to please you.

Staying in Playa del Carmen several times before, we loved this resort's location and close proximity to 5th Avenue. We confirmed king sized beds for a stay from 2/6 thru 2/10. When we arrived at the hotel around noon, you immediately notice how bare and boring this hotel looks. Plain white lobby with absolutely no foliage of any kind except for a tree growing in the lobby. At check in, we were told we would have 3 rooms in a row, but only 1 was immediately available. We decided to go look at the 1 room that was available and was very disappointed. The room was on the 3rd floor, had 2 beds, and the resort view was a view of the buildings next door. Also, there was a horrible banging going on when we were looking at the room. We immediately went back down to the lobby to request a room with king beds and inquire about the loud banging. We were told there were no rooms with king beds available until the 12th (2 days after we leave). Also, the check in person looked confused when we asked about the noise and made a call. She then told us there was construction going on everyday until 5:00pm. I told her that this was not what we asked for and we wanted what we paid for. We were told the hotel was full and we could not be moved to another location at the resort. We asked about moving to another Palace resort and the hotel offered to move us to the Moon Palace in Cancun or the Cozumel Palace in Cozumel. Our group loves Playa del Carmen and had no desires to stay in Cancun or Cozumel. We asked about the Aventura Spa Palace about 20 minutes further south, but was told that this is no longer a Palace property (recently being bought by the Hard Rock Hotel chain). We were told to go eat at the lunch buffet and they could see what can be done. We ate at the lunch buffet and everything was really good. No complaints about the service or food there. The check in person found us at lunch to offer to move us to the Aventura Spa Palace. We accepted the offer and Playacar Palace offered to give us a concierge level room, an additional 500 resort credits per couple, and to provide us transportation to the Aventura Spa Palace. Overall, I think the move to the new hotel worked out better for us since we had the type of room we had originally asked for and received the upgrades. When we arrived at the the Aventura Spa Palace after 4:00pm, they did have our reservations that we were coming but we had to argue with them for the extra resort credits that the Playacar Palace offered. It is very annoying to go somewhere and not have what you asked for and to lose 1/2 day of vacation trying to get it straightened out. Also, there is a small plane airport directly across from this hotel that I was not aware of. Every so often, you feel like the hotel is about to be dive bombed when a plane flies over. We did use our credits to come back to the Playacar Palace Spa (not located on property) during the week. The spa was wonderful. We enjoyed a 80 minute hydrotherapy massage and 50 minute facial.

Our \u201ckids\u201d are in their early twenties so not kids at all! We usually choose adults only AI hotels but being anxious to try this resort we decided to give it a try. We went to Beach Palace last Christmas and had a great stay and there were not many kids there. Can\u2019t say the same for here unfortunately but we still had a wonderful trip and we knew this was a possibility going in, so that it not the resorts fault!! Arrival: We arrived by Air Canada around noon and made a quick go through customs. Luggage and immigration\u2026.smooth as silk. Like always I do not make eye contact or talk to anyone until we see our rep. We had a couple of beer while waiting for everyone to arrive for our van and off we went! It is about a 45 minute drive. We stopped at Secrets Capri, Royal Playa del Carmen and then Playacar Palace. Check-in: The lobby is plain and everything I had read about. Has a big old tree in the middle and very basic but just what I had expected. It is a small open air lobby. Edgar checked us in and he was very nice. Our rooms were not quite ready so we went for drinks and then checked back in half an hour. The kid\u2019s room was ready so we went there. The room was not quite what we expected as we had paid for Superior Deluxe Oceanview. Well it did have a nice oceanview to the left but in front and to the right was the roof of the condos next door. Trust me it is very close!! We were not overly impressed but knew we would have a great deck with room for four so we did not get too upset.If I had received this room alone I would not have been happy. We book our rooms to have a great oceanview. This to me was a bit iffy. Considering it was close to ours the \u201ckids\u201d were fine with it. Other than that it was a very nice room. It has marble floors and everything we needed. We had our luggage delivered there as it was very close to our room. They said ours would be ready in half an hour\u2026.well an hour later I called down and they sent us up the keys. The keys did not work. A maid let us in and we went down after to get the keys reactivated. This was a bit of a rocky start but it soon gets better. Being seasoned travelers we did not get our knickers in a knot. Once settled into both rooms we did go down and ask re the kids room and if it was a true Superior Deluxe Oceanview room and he showed us on the computer (346) and it was. Our room was perfect (341) so we couldn\u2019t complain! It was a huge room, well appointed, huge deck with two loungers, two chairs and a table. It also appeared to have the beach webcam in the upper corner. Being a true trip advisor addict I thought this was very appropriate for me as I looked at those pics often LOL. I love this room as it was up 3 floors, perfect view of the beach and still could see the pool. For more privacy some may like 343, as it would be direct oceanfront with no view of the pool. I like to hear the music and watch people so this was perfect for us. Once settled we were very happy though a rocky start for us. Rooms: Nice design ! The rooms are a nice size! The floors have marble tile, double Jacuzzi, one sink, nice shower and lovely furniture. The balcony in the honeymoon suite was huge with an amazing view and was close to the water. The honeymoon suite also has a separate living area which was especially great for Christmas morning and room service. The bed is firm which is what we have at home so we love this. They have an added pad which was great. The other room was very nice as well. They had a very noisy AC and fridge that kept them awake the first night but after telling them at the front desk it was fixed right away and they even called to confirm they were fixed and to tell us to let them know if there were any other problems. So if there is something wrong tell them as the service was excellent! Beach: The beach in front of Playacar Palace is the BEST in the area. There is no big drop off which was great!! It was huge, deep very soft sand and not a bit crowded at a very busy time of the year. As you walk either way there is a sand drop off in places so this is the best beach in the area. There were lots of chairs and as the week got busier they brought more!! There was a VIP section for palace members with the nice padded chairs like we had at Sun Palace in the concierge level room. The thing that surprised me is for the first few days NO one was saving chairs. As a matter of fact I had put some personal towels and magazines on a few chairs and they were brought to the towel hut.The rest of the week I did not need to worry about finding chairs where you want them.Those coming out later may have trouble finding shade but just ask as they often can find you an umbrella. I saw the lifeguard carrying umbrellas for people and they weigh a ton!!! They have a huge base on them. It is a big job. You will be glad that you are staying at Playacar Palace when you walk by the other resorts as they are not as nice or as well kept. The beach is still very nice but not as nice as by Playacar Palace. The water is lovely and the bottom sandy. There is a bit of seaweed on some days but not bad at all. We had one red flag day and the rest were yellow so this was a nice treat. Pools: The pool stretches across the front of the resort and is a good size. It has stairs that are easy to access. It was lovely and warm unlike many resorts this time of the year. The swim up bar is a nice and large with stools and great service for drinks and food. The pool is on the beach pretty much which is a feature we look for in a resort. We often hang out at the pool. We did here for the first day but then started going to the beach as there were not as many kids there. They played quiet music in the morning at around noon they started to play a good variety of lively music. We really liked it. Entertainment: We don't go to many shows as we have seen many during our travels. We liked going to 5th avenue which is right there. They have a fire show and had a great Christmas show as well as other typical entertainment. The entertainment staff during the day kept people busy with water aerobics and beach volley ball, trivia etc. I have never seen so many people play beach volleyball in all of my travels. They had a great time and this beach was perfect for that! Resort Credits: Love this and used almost all of our 3000 resort credits (2 rooms). We did the dinner on the beach. Yes the grown kids went too. We had tables beside each other. They set up tables of 2 and it was beautiful. The kids were hesitant thinking it would awkward with couples but there were other tables with friends, sisters etc especially being Christmas. It was a beautiful night and we loved the meal and the kids did too! You get a menu with your name on it. The champagne was flowing and the food delicious. My daughter and I used most of the spa points for deluxe manicures, hot stone pedicures and facials. This was fun and relaxing! You just take the shuttle in front of the hotel (white van). It comes every 15 minutes and takes about 10 minutes to get there depending on the traffic. My daughter and I had a photo shoot done and had a ball. We had done this at Beach Palace with the guys but once was enough for them. We love our pictures and Paulina was sweet and the pics excellent. We got the Diamond Package (50 photos on a cd and 10 prints)\u2026..620 points. They charge 11% tax on photos but we really wanted to do this and we are glad we did. You can pay them there or open your credit for your room and they will add it to that. How often do you get quality photos taken by a photographer on a beautiful beach. We also got the animal and activities package. We also did the upgrade wine several time. We got Moet and it is $195. Once we knew we weren\u2019t going to spend any more of our points other ways, we just got a bottle with each meal. What a nice treat!! They just get you to fill out a form after the meal. At check out it all worked out and we did not have any charges so that was great! Restaurants:. Italian\u2026.WOW is all I can say. This is the best Italian Palace restaurant we have been to at Palace Resorts. The food and service were excellent. We ate here 3 times and all I can say is I miss it! They have far more than just Italian and the menu changes part way through the week. The steak here is excellent as is the pasta, soup, all of the salads, seafood dishes, etc. Oriental: We ate here once and the food was excellent! The appetizers came promptly but the wait for the main course was quite long. We didn\u2019t mind as we had another drink or so and chatted. Other people around us however were not as happy. Those with kids were really not happy and one mother left her family there! Anyways it just seems that it is not run as smoothly as the other restaurants. I had read some reviews and thought the food was not going to be very good. It was very good but just took awhile. Buffet: For breakfast we ate here each day and it was excellent. Really look around as they have everything there\u2026..Typical eggs to order, pancakes, waffles, fruit, cereals, yogurt etc . Always fresh and delicious. The wait staff bringing coffee, juice, champagne and were always prompt which was amazing as it was busy. Main Bar\u2026.in the morning I would get a coffee here before my walk on the beach. There are also danishes for breakfast \u2026..great little spot. They didn\u2019t have fresh milk here though like at Sun Palace so you had to use coffee mate. Room Service: We only ordered here once and this was for breakfast on Christmas morning. It was about 15 minutes late (we filled out the card you hang on the door) I called down and they said it was on the way. It was a very good breakfast but it was cool. I am sure everyone had the same idea and were most likely very busy. Bars: Main Lobby\u2026..we went here a lot and the service and drinks were great! Beach/Pool Bar: This is where the drinks are made for the beach service and pool. You can also sit at the bar here or at tables right there. The servers were excellent! Swim up bar was great as well. You can get food right there or at the tables or even delivered to your chair. Can\u2019t beat that!! Luna Lounge\u2026..this is a great bar with tv\u2019s. We didn\u2019t go here much but it is really beautiful and a great place to go for a drink. Beach service: We usually hang out at the pools when at resorts but there were a lot of kids so we went to the beach the rest of the week. The pool and beach are right there so going to the swim up bar is only seconds away even when you are at the beach. All of the beach waiters were excellent but one really stood out to us. Leonardo was the best we have seen on all of our travels. He was prompt, friendly and made a very difficult job seem easy. All of the the servers were amazing but he was to notch! Pros: Amazing staff\u2026all of them were great!! Lots of chairs by pool and on the beach. When occupancy went up they brought our more beach chairs Location is perfect!! 5th avenue is right there Santa arrived by jetski and they had a wonderful set up for him!!! This was very well done! We really appreciated the no smoking inside. As a matter of fact there just weren\u2019t a lot of smokers while we were there. Rooms are clean and well appointed\u2026.really large. Staff is very friendly. Now keep in mind we are very friendly people and we always have a smile on our face. We are never rude and we are very polite. Yes we tip but not every time. Red card/ green card for maid service\u2026.use it Lots of hot water 2 person Jacuzzi is huge and extremely comfortable with tons of hot water\u2026just allow time to fill Ocean view rooms/balcony\u2026..amazing views and very private\u2026some rooms don\u2019t have a balcony so ask!!!!! Never had to save chairs Palace dollar promotion is fantastic Service is amazing Safe works well Bedside table lights up Best drinks and you can get champagne (sparkling wine) everywhere! Best mohitos, mud slides, gin and tonic, electric lemonade\u2026.nice size glasses!!! Not tiny like at some places. No reservations Choices of house wines both red and wine\u2026.have extra palace bucks\u2026 ask for the wine list with prices and use some that way...be sure to say you want to use your resort credits Photos were great\u2026got extra Palace bucks try this\u2026.you won\u2019t regret it!! Nice spa treatments Right by 5th avenue, ferry to Cozumel, bars, shopping Best beach in the area by far\u2026..can walk for a long way No towel cards Sun all day long but lots of shade closer to the hotel and quite a few umbrellas Mini fridge aways stocked and restocked Jacuzzi works well\u2026just give time to fill\u2026actually very good water pressure here Honeymoon suite worth every penny!! The view\u2026.WOW!! Free calls home!! Just follow the card they give you for instructions Cons: Too many kids TV stations are not great (this is true of all hotels we have stayed in while in Mexico) Turn down service was a bit weak\u2026.missed us on a couple of nights Asian restaurant is delicious but go when you are not in any hurry and relax Pretty wicker chairs by pool but we did not find them very comfortable No fresh milk at early morning coffee station by bar Spa not on site (but really not far and the shuttle is dependable\u2026nice ride there to see the homes etc.) Some rooms don\u2019t have a full balcony Occasionally smelled exhaust from the ferry if the wind was blowing a certain way\u2026.only a couple of times Tips: Stop by the front desks or vacation planners to see how many points you have left Want something to eat on the beach\u2026ask one of the servers but be aware that the seagulls love food too and may be annoying. Do not leave your food unattended as the seagulls will swoop in (several of them) and steal your food. We saw one take a little girl\u2019s pizza\u2026.sad. At airport do not stop to talk to anyone once passed the red light/green light area\u2026..time share people everywhere\u2026.go to the person with your company or to your transfer. I do not even make eye contact with them let alone stop. They will try to trick you so don\u2019t talk to them. Trust me we are very polite people but please take my advice here A smile and manners go a long way They take American money everywhere we went except for Pull and Bears where they took Visa. They don\u2019t mind the tips in US .....most prices in stores are given in pesos and US. It was a real hassle for us to get pesos from our small town bank (order and sign\u2026.return and sign papers etc) Now we will just take US in small bills, 1,5,10 and 20. We paid taxis with US money as well. Not happy with something\u2026.let them know in a polite way and they will do anything for you Need a room card in the slot by the door to activate the power Want new room towels etc put them on the floor or in the shower\u2026.otherwise they will hang them up (green initiative) same as at home hotels As in most hotels if the balcony door is open the AC does not work. Enjoy every minute as it goes by quickly and then it is back to cooking your own meals Will we return??? I am sure we will but will choose a time when it is more likely that there will be fewer kids. If you like a small resort with amazing service, a perfect location and an amazing beach\u2026.this is the place for you. They are upgrading this hotel. They are going to build an on site spa and some other things to make it more like Le Blanc but it sounds like it will not be adults only", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boise, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Family Experience\u201d", "Author": "dawnmariet", "ReviewID": "UR124741731", "Content": "We went at the end of March for Idaho's School spring break.The weather was perfect.

NOT ACCEPTABLE. Apparently they are short room inventory because they are in the middle of construction on several of them to make them swim up rooms with private pools. I feel like I was duped. When I called to make my reservation, there was no mention of a room shortage or high bookings. I was told I had a reservation for what I asked for. People were checking out daily, I feel like they should have been able to transfer us into a decent room with a king size bed, since that is what I reserved. Despite several and repeated conversations with guest services, reception, etc. nothing was done. Finally, we gave up after two days and transferred to another sister resort. It was very dissapointing, the entire reason we chose Playacar was its convenient location to the ferry to Cozumel, Fifth Ave shops and restaurants and the gorgeous expanse of beachfront. Aside from the problem with the rooms, the resort itself is beautiful. The food was delicious, the service was good. PS It was rather ironic.

We had a great time and would recommend it to our friends for its location and service. The $1500 was nice, too. This was our first trip away from our one-year-old, so having the ability to call home from my room was very helpful. This was our 7th all-inclusive vacation and this hotel had the best service we have experienced. The staff were all friendly, professional and prompt most of the time. We never had an issue booking spa treatments or getting whatever we needed. On our last night we had an issue in our room. Some water leaked in through the ceiling (this kind of stuff happens in Mexico) and soaked our room, including some of my luggage. Guest services called several times before I could return their call. There wasn't anything they could do for me, but it was nice to know they cared. The resort was very clean, but there were some scratched walls and musty areas. This doesn't bother me at all, but it might bug some. The food at the resort was better-than-average for an all-inclusive. The Asian restaurant was fine. The food was fresh and tasted fine, but didn't taste like anything I'd had before. The buffet was pretty good. Their soups and fajitas were really good. The Italian restaurant was exceptional. We ordered many different items there over several nights and thoroughly enjoyed everything. The only things I'd change about dining here are: make service a little more efficient (meals took a little too long), have self serve coffee in the morning or more options ( I hated waiting for my coffee, which often took a while), and provide an outdoor dining option other than the buffet (we come to Mexico to enjoy the weather). We were in room 414, which was a Governor Suite. We had a fantastic view and were able to get that room using $1000 of our room credit. We'd already done most of the tours on previous visits to the Riviera Maya, so we didn't know how else to use it. The room was cleaned twice each day and was very comfortable. The beach was the best we've seen in Mexico. Sometimes the waves were rough, which made the water a little murky, but in the mornings the water was calm and clear. I really recommend getting up early in the morning to watch the sunrise over the ocean. It took us eight years of traveling to Mexico and the Caribbean to do it and we're glad we did. Chairs were abundant by the pool and ocean. Drink service was great, too, as long as you didn't need a new drink every 10 minutes. The music at the pool was inconsistent and not good. I really like resorts that play local music at the pool. I speak little spanish, but don't mind if I can't understand the words. I am annoyed by C&C Music Factory and unedited versions of Cee-Lo at the pool. There was little to no nightlife at the resort. The Luna Lounge was mostly empty every night, except one night when a group of rowdy 20 somethings took over. The Lobby Bar was fine, but often empty, too. Some live music or something would have been nice. We spent most evenings at the pool bar watching the cruise ships leaving Cozumel. Later on we'd head to 5th Ave. We mostly drink beer, with a few sipping tequilas in between, so I can't comment on drinks The best thing about Playacar Palace was its proximity to 5th Ave. A short walk down the beach (2 mins) took us to the Ferry Terminal. Another couple of minutes took us to 5th Avenue where we found a couple of fun bars and lots of great restaurants. Our favorites were Ajua Maya and Yaxche. Both had fantastic ceviches. We liked this end of 5th better than the other end. I had two massages on the terrace at the hotel. I think that it's the area they use for weddings, but they offered massages there during our stay, so I never made it to the spa. Both massages were wonderful. Our favorite day trip from the hotel was getting a cab (easy to do in front of the hotel) and going to Playa Akumal. It's about a 30 minute drive. We did this twice and snorkeled with the sea turtles. I recommend going early (before 8am) to beat the crowds. We hired a local tour guide for about $20/per person for 90 minutes both times. This included all the gear we needed and a boat ride to the reef. IAfterward you can play on the beach, which is really wonderful. t was the best thing we've done in Mexico. I would definitely return to this hotel. Being a mom, I'm always looking for places to take my little one. This hotel seemed to be well-prepared for kids. The kids club was empty most of the time, but they had plenty of clean high chairs in the restaurants and changing stations in the bathrooms.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay\u201d", "Author": "dd8881", "ReviewID": "UR124432219", "Content": "We stayed here for a week in early February.

None of the food is great, but for all you can eat and more, it's nothing to complain about. Above all else, the service is truly exceptional. It makes the experience. Whether at the beach, the pool, the lounge - you couldn't go a minute with any empty drink in front of you without someone asking if you needed something else. I've stayed at some fancy pants places, and the service here was better than any place I've stayed before. Even on cloudy days, the weather was warm, water clear, and beach was beautiful. My only complaint is that our room didn't get cleaned one day. However, the other days in which it was cleaned, it was sparkling. The palace credits were pretty easy to use. We used it for golf, the spa and the ruins. The golf course is tough, but beautiful. The spa is really nice, and the palace service quality again does not disappoint. We also paid for the Xel-Ha excursion (non-palace dollars) and it was a great excursion. I highly recommend it. The palace vacation planners were able to book it for us too. Overall, great choice.

The buffet was excellent everyday and there is really something for everyone. The grill by the pool at night always had a good selection. They even had a Super Bowl party pool side. Though tips are included we tipped at least $1-$5 (min 50 pesos) in the buffet and at all the bars. These folks make 56 pesos a day (we asked) and they worked their tails off to make sure we had a good time. Carlos at the swim up bar: we loved you! We exchanged our dollars at the front desk for $12.50 pesos, this beat the exchange rate in town and at the airport by far. We changed out Pesos (including coins) back to dollars at the front desk also. Very handy and very fair exchange rate. For our tours they offered box lunches and bottled water; just ask! Each morning we got 2 small bottles of water for our back packs while we were eating in the buffet, just asked our waiter. Lobby bar has to go coffee and espresso; each night the lobby bar has snacks and the Luna bar has a crepe bar too. you can order food at the pool bar, pool side and on the beach. Not a problem. All the drinks were top shelf and if you wanted a double, they got it for you. Always delivered with a 'my pleasure' and a smile. This was our first time at an AI and we were certainly impressed.

When we arrived, the resort had a very light and airy feeling to it. We immediately felt relaxed here. The beach was fantastic and clean- seats do go fast though! I think I mostly enjoyed it due to its proximity to 5th avenue. If you like to stroll at night, this is a great street to do so- felt safe, lots of people. Of course, like most tourist areas, you are hounded by people selling trips or items, but just keep on walking. The food at the resort was a wide variety, although sometimes bland depending on what you get. In any case though, if you don't like your dish, then you can always try something else! Everything always seemed fresh. We ate fruit the entire time and had no issues. The bartender we met was really nice and offered drinks we'd never heard of. It really does seem like your happiness is a priority. We got a chance to visit the Moon Palace and it made me glad we didn't stay there. It was so large that it didn't feel as friendly. If you do decide to visit the other resorts, understand that you may end up wasting half the day getting around. Also, keep the address of the resort with you- our bus driver one day kept confusing us with The Royal in Playacar. Honestly though, it has become a funny story to tell others of us trying to explain in Spanglish. The resort credits were nice, but if you're weighing options between where to stay, I personally wouldn't let the credits be a deciding factor. We never got a chance to visit Cozumel, but if you are interested, the ferry is right next door. The room was nice, however they should work on making the view from all rooms more pleasant.

We chose the unlimited golf instead of the $1500 resort credit and we were so pleased with our golfing experience. We booked tee-times before we left for every day of our vacation, which included transportation to and from each golf course as well as all food & beverages while we were there. We played all 27 holes at Moon Palace as well as the Riviera Course. Both are Jack Nicklaus designs and are beautiful golf courses, but we played the majority of our 21 rounds at the Playacar Golf Club and enjoyed it the most of all three. Our shuttle drivers Miguel and Carlos who transported us between the Playacar Palace and the Playacar Golf Club were wonderful hosts, smiling every morning when they picked us up and every evening when they dropped us off. The staff at the Playacar Golf Club are all excellent, Doreteo in the Pro Shop had our paperwork ready for us most mornings so we could hit the links quicker. The staff inside the Clubhouse and out were extremely warm and welcoming, especially Victor and Alejandro who kept us refreshed on the course from their beverage carts, we couldn't have asked for anything more. The golfing aspect of this vacation exceeded all our expectations.

You are also steps from Playa Del Carmen's 5th avenue which is a tourist attraction, but also a great place to find nice shops and restaurants. This is important because the restaurants at Playacar become quite boring after a few days. The buffet was great for breakfast and lunch, the Italian was good and the menu changed mid week (but eating at the same place every night is a bit much),and the Asian restaurant was awful. And like all, all inclusive resorts the wine list was less and attractive. The room was nice, and well stocked with alcohol, wine, juice and sodas. We had a nice ocean view, and deck, and hot tub in our room. The room was well taken care of although at times we were missing wash cloths, hand towels, or clean bath towels. They did do an evening bed turndown, and towel change which was nice. We did have trouble with the room above us continuously moving furniture around all hours of the night, so the rooms are not sound proof.

We arrived in Cancun on the 20th of January. We had booked through a member and had all the VIP amenities including two free trips (we only took advantage of one that we used for tulum) and the special beach beds (which were very nice). There are other differences between booking through a member or being a member and booking through a travel site but they are very minimal to the point that they were unnecessary. The differences include more food that you were allowed to order from room service and scented pillows. We were greeted by the staff upon arrivival with a drink and a cold towel. They had checked us into our room 411 and told us that we could upgrade to a governs sweet the next morning for two hundred virtual dollars but the only difference between the room we had and the sweet was the size of the room. So we did not upgrade. There are three restaurants that the resort has which are Italian, Asian, and buffet. The Italian was great. The service was amazing just like the rest of the resort and the food was honestly delicious. They would walk around and make you a Mayan coffee and fired bananas which were delicious and a wonderful show to watch. The Asian was not my favorite but I really do not like Asian food to begin with. The buffet is great. Every night they have a BBQ going on outside that you can order chicken, fish, fresh veggis, or meat that they will grill for you. They also changed the menus of the two alla cart restaurants every Wednesday and change the theme of the food every night for the buffet. The different themes range from seafood night, bbq night, Argentian night and so on. Many people complain that the food gets redundant but they do offer EVERYTHING. I think anything would get redundant eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner out for a week. There is honestly not one thing that the resort does not offer as far as food and for the most part everything taste great. If you do not see something on the menu they WILL make anything you would like to order. I would definitely say that the food is well above average. You have to remember that you are in a foreign country so do not expect the same food you would in America. You want American standards stay in America and pay American prices. The beach was beautiful. It was empty. There are plenty of chairs and you do not have to have to play the chair game and run down at five in the morning to get a suitable seat. There is also a waiter or waitress that walks around all day asking if you would like anything to drink, eat, another towel, move your umbrella for more or less shade. Also they would bring around an ice bucket that they have filled with ice and water which is replaced often. I would like to thank Leonardo who is a wonderful person and is very nice. He went above and beyond for us. Please if you go tip the people that really stand out. They work so hard and give you service that you will most likely never see in the states or any other resort. They also have a chef that comes around mid day and hand out little treats such as a sandwich, pop corn, ice pops, drinks of the day and other fun things. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. There is a Jacuzzi in the room and a fridge filled with alcohol. They also give biosilk products in the bathroom which is a nice touch. They also delivered daily treats to the room one day was truffles and another chocolate covered strawberries, another nice touch! The virtual dollars are a REALLY NICE TOUCH. Unlike other resorts this is not a scam or a way for you to spend more money at the resort. You can use it for a day at the spa, pictures taken on the beach, day trips, romantic dinner on the beach, wine list upgrade, room upgrade and so on. Depending on the amount of nights that you are staying at the resort depends on the amount of virtual dollars you will receive. You can pay 100% of what you choose to do with the virtual dollars. I really did not have any problems with this resort. I felt that the people that were visiting were extremely nice and there was the occasional one or two who were very snotty looking for a bad time. If you have the outlook of having a great time and not nitpicking every little detail you will have a GREAT time! Remember this vacation is about spending time with loved ones in a beautiful place not watching a waiter.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Wedding, Satisfied 20 People!!\u201d", "Author": "perry1217", "ReviewID": "UR123670306", "Content": "Stayed at Playacar Palace with 20 of our wedding guests the first and second weeks of January and could not have been happier. Wilma, the Wedding Coordinator, was an absolute dream to work with and made the planning process super easy and seamless. Planning from afar, we relied heavily on her expertise and the reviews we had seen on here to help us make a good decision when choosing a resort. I was so happy we chose Playacar. Some amazing pics of the resort as well as our complimentary beach wedding can be found here at http://www.jennycastrophotography.com/blog/?p=554 The staff at PP goes out of their way, seriously, to ensure your happiness there. I thought it was a bit hokey that people would come back from vacations there knowing the names of the staff, but sure enough by the end of our trip we wanted to pack up Nora, the waitress, Junaita, the hostess, and Mario, a waiter helping out from Moon Palace and bring them home with us. We had pink bracelets signifying us as honeymooners which meant everyone was even more accommodating! The only time we heard the word \"no\" from one of the wait staff, it was followed by a big laugh and a \"Hahaha! I joke!\". The service was spectacular. Mario, who was helping from Moon Palace, was probably our favorite there. He constantly went out of his way to take care of us if he saw us in the restaurant he was working in. He even took my stepmother's plate from her at the buffet line, carried it for her, and took her by the arm to her seat!!! For our newlywed dinner, of course we requested him and he was the best! As for food , the buffet was rotated daily so that you did not get sick of it, and I loved the sushi variety in the Oriental restaurant (try the plaintain wrapped sushi!!!!). Our favoriite had to be the AMAZING vanilla ice cream. Yum yum yum!!! Location was one of the best parts of the resort. It is literally steps away from downtown Playa del Carmen and Fifth Avenue which means it is so easy and safe to explore. Many of the resorts we had looked at previous to settling on PP were huge compounds where you really couldn't leave unless you booked an excursion or took a taxi. At Playacar, you just walked right out!! We were also able to walk a minute or two down the beach and take the ferry over to Cozumel for the day. Once you get off the ferry and walk down to the street, hang a right, walk about 10 minutes or so down the street and you will see Cozumel Palace on the right. WOW!! That is a beautiful resort and they have snorkeling equipment for you to use while you jump right off their attached dock and swim around the coral reef that the hotel is situated on. It was awesome. I wish I could have given this 5 stars but the front desk, who is rude, short, and not even half the customer service stars the wait staff are, and the whole resort credit sham is keeping it a 4. We were told, even though the resort was not even close to full capacity, that there were no rooms available for upgrade. For God's sake, it was our wedding and honeymoon, do you have to play the same tired game that I have seen others on here complain about with these room upgrades??? Also, the resort credit planners, who are CONSTANTLY with guests, and there is never more than 2 working, lie about what is available to book. For instance, they would say that there was no spa appointments, until pressed and pressed and then finally one magically opens up after they \"see what they can do\".. It's a shame those people are not even close to the same caliber as the wait staff. Because the price is marked up due to the resort credits which are difficult and tedious to use, it definitely lowers the value of this otherwise amazing resort. I would definitely recommend the resort, but with the expectation that you're never ever ever going to be able to use those credits like you would want to. It is worth noting that we had people in our group that had and had not been to an all inclusive before and everyone agreed this place was top notch! I'm just a little jaded that they couldn't give an upgrade to honeymooners who brought 20 people down, stayed 9 nights, and had tons of resort dollars to use toward it!", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Lyon, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cPlayacar Palace is AMAZING!\u201d", "Author": "far733", "ReviewID": "UR123598688", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Playacar Palace in January for our anniversary. Our stay was beyond what we expected or could have imagined! From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty! Upon our arrival, a bell boy took our bags and we checked-in at the main desk where we were given a drink, a cooling towel, and my wife was also given a flower. We originally booked a partial ocean view room, but we received a complimentary upgrade to a full ocean front room! After we checked in, we met with the \u201ctime share\u201d representative who tried to get us to attend a membership presentation. However, we politely declined and we were not approached about it again. Room: As stated, we originally booked a partial ocean view room, but we received a free upgrade to a full ocean view room without having to use any of our resort credits. We stayed in room #412. The room was spacious and very clean. The balcony was plenty large for both of us to sit on. It had a direct view of the ocean with the beach and palm trees just below us, the pool to our right, and the Cozumel ferry to our left. The view was incredible! Each morning we sat on the balcony and watched the sunrise directly in front of us. In the evening, we would watch the cruise ships as they left Cozumel. We had a king size bed and a double Jacuzzi. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was stocked with Biosilk bath products. The fridge was stocked daily and the room was cleaned daily. A few of the nights, we received turndown service. There were also robes and slippers for us to use during our stay. The safe was plenty large and we were able to use it without any problems. The free Wi-Fi and the free phone calls to the USA worked easily and were nice to have. Pool/Beach: The pool was very comfortable and refreshing to swim in and it was cleaned daily. It is about 4 feet deep and there are also shallower areas for smaller children. The beach was gorgeous! We walked both north and south along the beach and quickly learned that the Playacar Palace has the best beach in the area! It is clean and not crowded at all. The water was an amazing turquoise blue and the waves were calm enough so that we could swim/wade in the ocean. There were plenty of loungers at both the pool and the beach and we never had to fight for a chair with an umbrella. The wait staff along the pool and beach was equally great and we were never without a drink. A special mention to Perla, Leonardo, and Nelly! And a special mention to the pool bartenders Antonio, Carmen, and Gerardo! Resort Credit: We stayed 6 nights so we received $1500 in resort credit. We spent it in the following increments: $300 at the Spa: My wife used the spa credits on a deluxe manicure, a deluxe pedicure, and an 80 minute deep tissue massage. She said that she loved every second of it and it was the best pedicure, manicure, and massage she has ever received! The free shuttle to the spa was located at the front desk and it came every 15 minutes or less. One could also walk there if they wanted to. It is a very safe and scenic walk through Playacar and it takes about 20 minutes or so. $260 Swim with the Dolphins: This program took place at Dolphinaris at Riviera Maya. Transportation was not included so we caught a taxi at the front desk. The taxi ride was about 20 minutes. It cost $20 USD one way if you did not exchange to pesos before hand, otherwise it was $17 USD one way if you exchanged to pesos first. There is free currency exchange at the front desk. The program was very fun and enjoyable! We were able to do the hug/kiss, the handshake, plenty of petting, a belly ride, and a double foot push! (We pre-booked the spa reservations and the Swim with the Dolphins before we arrived.) $820 Photo Session: We celebrated our anniversary on our trip so we decided to go with the most expensive photo session. We received a 45 minute photo shoot with Fabian (who was quite entertaining!), 15 printed photos, and 70 photos on a CD. The photos turned out great and we had a lot of fun during it! There is an 11% tax you have to pay. Food: We ate at the Main Buffet for breakfast and dinner, the Pool Bar for lunch, the Italian Restaurant twice, and the Asian Restaurant once. No reservations were required at any of the restaurants. If the resort lacked in any area, it was with the food. My wife and I are very simple when it comes to food. We are easily pleased with a burger and fries and we are not fancy gourmet food eaters by any means. That being said, the food always had an amazing presentation to it, but we were left wanting more in the way of flavor. Some of our favorite meals were at the Pool Bar (club sandwich, cheeseburger and fries, guacamole, nachos, etc.) Our favorite of the restaurants was the Italian. Again the service at the restaurants was great! After we ate at the Asian Restaurant, we wanted more dessert delivered to our room. So, we called room service and it was delivered by the same waiter who waited on us at the Asian Restaurant! A special mention to Eduardo at the Italian Restaurant too; he was so kind and polite! Room service food was surprisingly good and the service was quite fast! Entertainment: All of the Entertainment Crew (Gabrielle, Rodrigo, Fania, and Ghretta) were great! During the day, they would play trivia, bingo, water aerobics, water polo, and beach volleyball. We participated in the trivia, bingo, and beach volleyball. We had a lot of fun getting involved with the entertainment and we got to know them as a result of this. However, if you did not want to participate, they were fine with that too. During the night, we watched the fire show and participated in the salsa dancing lessons. Both were a lot of fun! The Entertainment Crew works hard to please the guests. They were always so engaging and fun to be around! I will miss my daily games of beach volleyball! Service: I can\u2019t say enough about the service at this resort! The staff are willing to bend over backwards to please you! They never said no to any of our requests and they always said it was their pleasure. The staff always greeted us with a Hola or a Buenos Dias and a smile! After the first day, they remembered our names and what we liked to eat/drink! We tipped consistently throughout our stay for the services we received and the staff was genuinely appreciative for it! We would have felt horrible had we not tipped because the staff truly worked so hard for us! 5th Avenue: We walked 5th Ave. during our stay during both the day and night. We always felt safe. The shop keepers do ask you to come into their shops, but they are not overbearing at all. We had fun with them and politely declined when we didn\u2019t want to. Be sure to bargain on the prices because they will come down. If you don\u2019t get the price you want, just politely walk away. We ate at Carboncitos for dinner one night and it was delicious! We got a lot of great food for cheap! We definitely want to return to the Playacar Palace in the future and we would recommend it to anyone considering going there! We read reviews before our trip that complained of poor service while other large groups stayed here. That was not the case with this trip, despite there being two wedding parties and a business convention party that were also staying there during our stay.

I have stayed at their every Christmas and New Years for the past four year. I have returned every year because of the great service, friendly staff, wonderful location, extraordinary staff, accessible local management. I have always given the hotel a great rating. As mentioned, I've taken my family to the Playacar Palace for many years. Moreover, I've been traveling a couple of times a year to the Mayan Riviera since 1988, so I am pretty familiar with hotel service standards in the area. While it has never been a five star hotel, (like the Ritz Carlton) it has tried it's very best to act like one. The waiters, bartenders, and pool staff are all great.

You will see several other complaints about this hotels decision out of Miami to begin renting the hotel out for \"Spring break\" or Christmas break\" drunken college bashes. As was mentioned in several other reviews the the new owned decided that they would allow a groups that rent about 20% of the rooms take over all of the hotel. This Christmas they did so. They allowed this group to set up live music with speakers and a sound system similar to those used in a large concert in the US. This a full blown concert allowed to be set up 20 yards from the rooms. They were allowed to play until they chose to turn it off. I spoke with many of the other guests that complained to management, but were told that the decision was made in Miami to rent the hotel out to these type parties. The next night the party and the music lasted until 8 am. Let me remind you that these were not small speakers, but a sound system not unlike the one Madonna uses on her concert tour 20 yards from the rooms. Management, who received numerous complaints simply said their hands were tied. So, if you want to go on a peaceful vacation, this is not the place for you. Finally, I have seen management respond to several of these reviews with an apology. Quite honestly, the management needs to do more than apologize to the numerous Palace members that had to suffer to the extraordinary mismanagement that took place over the Christmas and new years holidays. A real five star hotel would make things right with the customers whose vacations were destroyed!!", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Easton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWonderful All-Inclusive Vacation, Beautiful Beach/Pool Area, Fantastic Location & Value\u201d", "Author": "Padrino1", "ReviewID": "UR123116753", "Content": "I stayed at Playacar Palace in November 2011 with my wife and 18 month old daughter. We booked through a Palace member and saved a substantial amount of money from the best prices available online. We found this resort to be a fantastic value and overall quality for an all-inclusive vacation. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a honeymoon suite without even having to use any of our resort credits. Location/Amenities: You cannot beat the location of this resort. I walked up and down the beach in both directions and it was very clear Playacar Palace offered the best beach area hands down, while also being located right next to 5th Avenue and the ferry to Cozumel. The beach area for the hotels to the north near the center of PDC are filled with fishing boats tied to the short with ropes and the water s not as clear. Playacar Palalce is literally only a 1 minute walk to 5th Avenue and all of the great shops, restaurants, etc. The resort has 3 nice bar areas/lounges, a great gift shop, 1 large pool and 3 restaurants. You can book many different activities/excursions through the resort using your resort credits, but we did not do any this trip because of how young our daughter was. Room: Our honeymoon suite was perfectly located on the 3rd floor on the south side of the resort toward playacar. It had a very nice living room along with a large master suite w/ jacuzzi, a beautiful bathroom, and a huge terrace with a great view directly overlooking the beach. Room came with 2 refrigerators which were re-filled daily. We couldn't have been happier with our room accommodations- it was perfect. Beach/Pool Area: This is probably my favorite part of the resort. The very long pool sits directly in front of the beach and is probably the best designed pool for very small children that I have seen. It has this large ledge that runs the distance of the pool on one side, a swim-up pool bar at one end geared toward the adults, and the children's section at the other end. Pool area had a large number of loungers and umbrellas, so it was never a problem getting one. The beach area is also supplied with loungers, umbrellas, and many beach beds. The resort offers very attentive beach/pool service for food and drinks. On many days, they had a cookout for lunch with made-to-order burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, etc. My only criticism here is that the quality of standard frozen drinks (daiquiris, margaritas, and mudslides) could be improved. They were too watered down and mix used needs to be better. The beach directly in front of the resort was tremendous since the replenishment project was completed a few years back. the beach is now 100 yards wide. Perfect soft sand, never too hot. The ocean water was a beautiful aquamarine/blue-green color and pretty calm, with very small waves which were fun for us to tug our daughter around in a float. Food/Service: The resort has 3 restaurants (Buffet, Italian, andAsian). We found breakfast/lunch at the buffet to be great with numerous made-to-order choices (pancakes, waffles, eggs, omelets, etc.) and lots of fresh fruits, breads, pastries, etc. The buffet was great for small children as it was a very casual atmosphere. My favorite dinner was the steak I had at the Italian restaurant. We did not try the Asian. Overall, I thought the food quality was good for an all-inclusive resort, but not the best I have had on vacation. Overall: We loved this resort and will be returning very shortly as it perfectly suits our present needs with a young child.

The food in the Japanese restaurant was horrible. My entire family and two couples next to my family in the restaurant all had to send food back because it was too cold.

The buffet was great for breakfast and lunch, dinner was fair. The best part of the hotel was the staff, absolutely fabulous! Friendly, talkative and they all really want to please you! The worst part of the trip was when some nobody celebrity and his entourage of 150 people TOOK OVER the hotel. They had three parties, each lasting till the wee hours of the morning. The earliest the party one of the parties was 3:00 a.m and the New Years Eve party lasted until 8:00 a.m, you may think I'm lying but believe me when I say there were people in ball gowns outside until 8:00 a.m. with the music BLASTING until 6:00 am. This group ruined our experience by controlling the beach area with their setups, loud music and rude, pot smoking entourage. The staff completely disregarded us, we weren't even aloud to eat outside one night! We surely will never stay here again or recommend this to anyone.

The spa, rooms, food, service, beautiful beach and pool, top-notch entertainment and location to Playa del Carmen combine to make this resort exceptional.

I believe it's offered everyday. We caught a cab there. We then went to Aventura Spa Palace to check it out and have lunch. It is much bigger, but we loved Palayacar more. We did have lunch, went kayaking and had a few drinks. We had a nice time. If you decide to do this as well...we were leaving dolphinaris and they told us we should cab because it was a 20min walk, etc. It was to the right and right across the street. We would have easily walked it. We also did the steak, lobster, champagne dinner. It had rained that afternoon so it was in another room instead. It was closed to everyone, minus the 5 couples having the dinner. It was great and we thought it was worth it, since we were using our credits and not coming out of our pockets. They came around with the champagne and would fill our glasses as much as you drank and wanted. It was great, because we did drink more than the bottle we thought was included! lol I was also able to book this in advance and it is only available on certain days. We used our credits and did the couples massage at the spa offered through Playacar. We took the van offered by the hotel. Approx a 5 min drive. Arrive an hour early and enjoy the different amentities in the spa before the massage. It was fantastic! We were so relaxed. My hubby wasn't sure he really enjoyed massages until we came here. He was sold on massages after this. We even walked to fifth ave and had an hour massage each another day. $30 us a person, so cheap. Also, very nice. Lastly, we used the remainder of our credits and did a photo shoot at the hotel. It was a ton of fun and the pics were amazing. I made a photo book with them when we got home and friends and family can't believe how great they turned out. The lady was so professional. The staff at Playacar is outstanding and we would totally go back!", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cExcellent vacation at Playacar Palace\u201d", "Author": "HW73", "ReviewID": "UR122727536", "Content": "We stayed at the Playacar Palace from 20th - 25th Dec. This was our first all inclusive experience and was fantastic. The beach is fabulous,we used to go for long walks on the beach. The sand is the softest ever! The location of the resort is perfect - very close to shopping & the ferry to Cozumel. The food was great with sufficient variety. We ordered room service every morning before going for a walk on the beach, and it was always delivered to the room perfectly on time. Loved the italian restaurant. The Asian restaurant was ok too! Nightly entertainment nice and the staff put in a lot of effort to to organize various activities such as beach volleyball, pool volley ball. Kids loved the kids club and used to be there all time. There were a bunch of other kids during that time, which made it a fun experience for them. But the best thing of all was the service. All the staff is wonderful & go out of their way to make the guests comfortable. We used our resort credits to go to Tulum, golf, spa & pictures. We planned to use our resort credits to upgrade our room, but didn't have to as we were given a nice ocean view room on the 5th floor. The only tip that I would have is - book all the activities such as spa appointments, golf tee times & tours as soon as you arrive so that you can do the things that you want most optimally. We had a leftover credit of $300+ that we could not use but had we needed to upgrade the room, we would have spent those as well. I totally recommend the photo session with the professional photographers - the lowest package starts at $250 resort credits. We did the 'Gold' package that cost $450 in resort credits, but had to pay the taxes. But it was well worth it - the pictures are awesome.All in all - an incredible vacation.

We were the only ones travelling with a 1 1/2 year old, so we were a little nervous about the logistics of everything. We arrived at Playacar Palace around lunch time to find our room was not ready yet. We decided to head down to the buffet to grab some lunch and hoped our room would be ready soon, as we needed to put our little one down for a nap ASAP. After lunch we learned our room was ready so we went directly there to get settled. The resort had a playpen set up in our room already however we brought our own. Im glad we did because the one they provided us with looked \"well used\" and I would have been a little apprehensive about having our little one sleep in it. We stayed in room #342 which has a magnificent ocean view. We loved having this view because it gave us something to look at while we hung out on the balcony during nap times. We had a king sized bed which was very comfortable and had the greatest pillows!! The room was always clean and mini bar restocked. My husband and I found that although the room was very tastefully decorated its not toddler friendly. Everything was super hard. The table and nightstands were all marble tops and the tile floors were very slippery after a bath or shower. Im defiantly not complaining because the rooms were beautiful just if you are travelling with kids be aware. The hotel itself is defiantly on a smaller scale then other places we have stayed but that didnt negatively influence our trip at all, in fact it may have done just the opposite. The staff and attention to detail is remarkable! Every staff member you pass in a room or a hall will greet you with a smile and hola!! Breakfast was always great at this resort. There were always lots of options. You could choose a big elaborate breakfast or just have the at home basics (cereal, toast, fruit, ect). The buffet for lunch doesnt open until 12:30 but the pool side bar served a selection of things earlier and we found ourselves eating there often. One side note I will add regarding lunch....if you ask at the buffet during breakfast time you can get a packed lunch to take with you on excursions. It has a lunch, fruit, and bottle of water. Its a great thing to pick up before heading out for the day! We ate at the Italian restaurant 2 nights during out stay and both nights found the food was excellent. If you get there right at 6:00 there is no problem getting in, however anything later then 6:30ish you will have a wait. We did not eat at the Asian restaurant but some of the people we travelled with did and they enjoyed it. The dinner buffet we found to be hit or miss. It wasnt terrible food but it also wasnt the best. Some nights there were different foods set up outside as well. The wedding we attended was on the wedding terrace. It was a beautiful spot providing a wonderful background to get married with. Everything ran smoothly and the staff were great at making everything look perfect. The wedding was at 2:00 followed by pictures and then dinner out on the patio. The dinner for the wedding was excellent. There was tons of food!! It happened to be the American Thanksgiving holiday so they served a delicious turkey as well! The pool was fantastic!!! We spent a good portion of our week there. It was great because there is a small wading pool that attaches to the main pool which made it easy for us with our little one. There were always lots of chairs although the prime spots were picked up quickly. The sea was beautiful. The beach was always being well cared for and any seaweed that may have washed up with the waves was raked up daily. There is no doubt that the location in perfect. With a very quick 2-3 min walk on the beach you are at the ferry to Cozumel and 5th ave. We went a few times to 5th ave with the stroller and never had any problems. We did not go to Cozumel this visit however I believe it was about $25pp round trip. We received $1500 in resort credits and did manage to use them all up! We used them for a room upgrade,a visit to the spa, a session with the photographer and some tequila gift sets to take home. The spa was off site but not far at all. You can catch a shuttle that ran appox every 15 mins or so. The spa was fabulous. I had the 80 min aromatherapy massage which was probably one of the best I have ever had. Make sure to take your swimsuit to the spa...there is a hot/cold bath area with steamroom. The pictures with the photographer turned out really well. It was a perfect keepsake for our first family vacation with the three of us! To summarize everything up....we had a great trip at a top notch resort. I defiantly recommend this resort to everyone...couples, families, friends etc!

This past week, my daughter and her 1-year-old son suddenly stricken with an acute and serious illness. Within minutes of emailing the manager with a request for an ambulance, one was called and the manager Mr. Rene Malacara Coss and one of his deputys were at my daughter's room. He arranged transportation for everyone to nearby hospital [where by the way] outstanding medical care was delivered. The manager arranged for food and clothing to be sent to the hospital as well as a crib for my grandson. He also sent one of his senior managers with us to provide translation at the hospital. This was invaluable and enabled the emergency physician and the specialists to immediately arrive at an accurate diagnosis and provide prompt an effective medical therapy. When they returned from the hospital, my daughter and her son required a special diets which was provided quickly and efficiently. During our stay between Christmas and New Year's, there was indeed a problem caused by a noisy group [150?] of self important, narcissistic so-called \"VIPs\". On the night of December 30 they had a private party outside the hotel which was extremely noisy and went on from 8 PM until 1 AM in the morning. The extremely loud volume of the music caught everybody by surprise Not least the hotel management. In response to this, the hotel management went out and purchased earplugs and delivered them to all the guests. This was an appropriate response, and probably the only response available to management. On the New Year's Eve, that same group of so-called \"VIPs\" healthy New Year's Eve celebration from 8 PM until 6 AM. I think it is extremely unlikely that such an event will ever happen again at the Playacar Palace. When I read negative reviews of any resort I always wonder when there are problems with the resort that could be remedied, if the reviewer has contacted the manager directly. In our many years of experience staying at \"Palace Resorts\", we have never encountered a problem that could not be corrected if one could identify and contact directly the hotel manager. The \"Palace Resorts\" group of hotels are run by outstanding well trained managers. In any organization, and perhaps even more so in Mexico there is a \"Silo\" management structure, and the secret to problem solving is to bring your problem directly to the \"upper level\" of the \"Silo\" to a level where you encounter an individual who is empowered to take whatever corrective action as is necessary.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorst all inclusive hotel- stay elsewhere if you value food, relaxation, and service\u201d", "Author": "Dilnaz22", "ReviewID": "UR122295430", "Content": "After having stayed at other palace hotels, we were looking forward towards spending our holiday season vacation at Playacar Palace.

The food is fair at best, the hotel is located next to the very loud and busy ferry port, a nightclub and skydiving office, and the pool music blasts so loudly from early morning until late at night. The loud music blasting from the pool wakes you up early in the morning and makes it hard to sleep at night. Overall it's not a peaceful location nor is the atmosphere relaxing. The one positive was the service- the employees are so kind and dedicated. They make up for the other major shortcomings. However, the supreme service was disrupted when a D List celebrity party planner and his rowdy entourage of 150 people overtook the hotel. The hotel forgot about the rest of its regular guests and devoted all its attention and amenities to this huge VIP group. Several guests commented that it felt as if everyone else did not matter once the VIP crew showed up. This VIP group threw massive and very loud/disruptive parties each night that went into the wee hours of the morning. So much for a restful and enjoyable vacation.

So I went in with pretty high expectations, that were not fully met. Firstly the good about the hotel - I think the staff is the hotel's greatest strength. Everyone is really friendly and helpful without the expectation of being tipped for every little thing. The location of the hotel too is really nice if you want to be close to the 5th ave & the Cozumel Ferry. The beach is amazingly beautiful and never crowded. The food in the restaurants is quite good, though you may start wanting more choices after staying there for 3-4 days. They have excellent wifi. Their resort credits promotion is really good, fully transparent and gives you multiple options to truly use all your credits without any fine print. The one final touch where I felt the resort lived up to its reputation was when they gave us a room after checking out to keep our luggage and allow our son to rest for a couple of hours in the afternoon before we left the resort. That was truly going above & beyond. So what about the hotel did not live up to expectations? 1. The fact that this is a small & intimate hotel makes it very susceptible to having your experience spoiled by a few loud / boorish guests. We had problems 2 nights in a row with people shouting in the corridors, banging doors and having loud parties near the pool. I think in a hotel like this, the management needs to be more proactive about managing such problems instead of waiting for their guests to complain. 2. We had another problem where our room was not cleaned till 1 pm despite a couple of reminder calls. And then after we explicitly asked not to be disturbed for a couple of hours since our infant son was sleeping in the room, housekeeping called the room twice asking to come & clean the room! 3. For whatever reason, the Oriental restaurant gets step-motherly treatment in terms of staffing. When we had a meal there, service took inordinately long for every little thing. It was not the waiter's fault since he was constantly running around, but he was staffing too many tables. 4. We had another bad experience when we tried to upgrade the room. First the person at check-in could not do it till she she got clearance from her manager the next morning which required us to unnecessarily move in & out of a room for 1 night. Then the next day, we were told the room would be ready at noon so we packed up the first room only to be later told that the new room would be ready only at 4 pm. They finally hurried it up once I complained, but again, its the sort of thing you would not expect at highly rated, premium resort. I think most of the negatives have more to do with some poor management of this specific property and is not an endemic issue that cannot be fixed. On balance, my lasting impression of this resort is positive and think it should certainly be in your consideration set - just keep some of the potential negatives in mind so that you have realistic expectations.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent customer service\u201d", "Author": "MaxnKel", "ReviewID": "UR122011450", "Content": "The staff at Playacar Palace is top notch.

This year we stayed at Playacar Palace (in December) to try something different. I'm just going to compare the experiences because I think it may be helpful to others trying to make a decision. Both are wonderful and the staff are exceptional so you can't go wrong either way. Playacar and CP are set up almost the same way where the resort surrounds a single pool area but Playacar is smaller with one pool bar on the shady end where Cancun has two - one at the shady end and one at the sunny end. The pool atmosphere at Playa was a little more subdued than CP with fewer activities, but the couple we traveled with said it had really been hopping and fun when they went earlier in the year. Gerardo is the best bartender ever and took care of us all week. Props to Ana and Leo, too. We never went without a drink.The ocean water at both resorts was the most beautiful blue and both beaches are good, but Playa's beach is exceptional. The beach is flat, the sand is soft, and the water was calmer. Almost always a yellow flag so we spent so much more time in the ocean at Playa. If you like shopping or trying local restaurant fare, Playa is the place for you. Fifth Ave is a three minute walk via the beach or the street. Go at night. Fun. When at CP, we went snorkeling on the Jungle tour and Swim with Dolphins at Wet n Wild. Would definitely do the Jungle Tour again and Swim with Dolphins facility at Wet N Wild was very nice, but the water park itself was just ok. Would not want to spend the day there. If traveling with kids, they would likely have a great time, though. Did not do Tulum tour from CP because it was just too far, but we did do it this year from Playacar. If you have time, it is very interesting and the beach is beautiful. The iguanas that live there are a hoot! Bring your camera. Still a long day but the stop at Aventura Spa/Cove on the way back allowed us to see another Palace resort to consider for future vacations. It was beautiful but I think a little too big and spread out for us. Another plus is the ability to take the ferry to Cozumel from Playacar. Easy to get tix. $13USD each way per person. Don't get round trip. Buy return tix when you're ready to leave. Ferrys pretty much run on the hour. Even though the ferrys are big, if the ocean is rough, go prepared with your meds! Walk to Cozumel Palace is about 15 mins or take a taxi. When you get there, sign up with the front desk for a room to freshen up in before you go to dinner or head back to the ferry. We spent afternoon at the pool. More of a party atmosphere at this resort. Music was fun and service at the pool was great. Did not snorkel, but could have. Pool was small and easy to see how one group could take over. Water was strangely warm. I think this would be a fun place to stay with a group. Restaurant menus looked great. I liked having 5 restaurant choices at CP. Playacar has only 3 and I'm not a big fan of Japanese food. They did say there were some additions coming in the near future.The buffet changed daily and the Italian menu changed mid week while we were there. The Italian at Playa will allow dress shorts and collared shirts for men - at least they did when we were there. We asked. Angel is the manager in the Italian and he is awesome! If you want something not on the menu, just ask. He will make it happen for you!!! Eugenio was our waiter a few times. He was so sweet and accomodating. I think you get to know the staff better at Playa and they will definitely give personal service. Carlos in the lobby bar took over best bartender title from Gerardo when the pool bar wasn't open. One night I spent a few hours curled up with a book on a lobby bar couch while hubby was sleeping off to much ocean water (hehe) and Blanca kept checking on me and brought all kinds of treats. So sweet. Spa at CP is onsite which makes it easy. Spa at Playacar is offsite. A little more of a hassle but not a deal breaker. They were out of water most of the week and made no effort to call over to the hotel to give us a heads up which was disappointing, but we made it work. Stuff happens. No biggie. If you can get Erandi to do your massages, you won't be sorry! The biggest complaint I have with Palace and I've seen others mention it as well is the room availibility issue. My two big necessities were ocean front and king bed. When originally booking and even finalizing transfers- which was kind of a phone tag nightmare - we asked what the chances were that we would be able to upgrade to concierge when we got there. No problem...not very full. Wrong. When we got there, the whole story changed to the point where we had them call around to check availibility of ocean front kings at other resorts. None. Really???? I sooo very much want to thank Nancy for calling the GOOD manager on his day off and both of them for making it right. We got Governors suites and used our credits to upgrade. I didn't get concierge, but Nancy had Lavender Mint pillows sent up to our rooms ASAP. That's my favorite Concierge perk. I really wish Palace could just be up front and let you confirm a room choice before you spend the money and travel that far. I will seriously consider paying for Concierge up front next year so no surprises or disappointments upon arrival. We had no issues at CP check in last year but it is a much bigger place. So next year I think CP will be the choice for us again. Again - both resorts are wonderful and I would stay at either one again. Just comes down to personal preferences.

By staying at the Playacar you have free access to all the other nearby Palace Resort facilities - at Cosumel Palace, Adventura Palace, and, even Moon Palace when transportation is available. And, the town of Playa Del Carmen is right there outside the resort - it is not an isolated enclave like some places.

I was told the resort was more expensive than \u201cAdventura Cove Palace\u201d due to its close location to Fifth Avenue shopping area. It is also close to Banco Santander ATM (on Av Benito Juarez, between 20 and 25 Av Sur). With Bank of America ATM, I can withdraw MXM (Mexican Peso) with no fee. The exchange rate is the best, USD1 = MXM 14.09 (November 24, 2011). Bus station is 5-minute walk from the resort. The closest Starbucks is at Paseo del Carmen, only 3-minute away on foot. Airport transfer from cancun-cab.com was good and on time. It costs USD45 per person round trip. However, according to the taxi fares displayed at Playacar Palace, it costs only MXM 520 (about USD 37) for one way airport transfer. This rate is per car, not per person. The resort architecture is minimalist (like the name says, the design is simple and minimal). It is not as grand as I thought after reading other reviews. If you want a luxurious resort with manicured garden and elegant landscaping, go to Westin Resort in Bali (see my previous review of Westin Resort in Nusa Dua, Bali). Restaurants ========================= There are two a-la-carte restaurants: Italian \u201cLa Terraza\u201d and Asian \u201cMo Mo No Hana\u201d, and one buffet \u201cCaf\u00e9 del Mar\u201d. We dined at the Italian and Asian restaurants. The menu choices are fancy but the food is so-so. I think only the fried lomien is not bad. Similar to the grand buffet in Las Vegas, Caf\u00e9 del Mar has more than 50 buffet items to choose for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Before you travel, lose some lbs. first, so you won\u2019t feel guilty at the buffet. Ask the waiter to \u201cmix\u201d Mayan coffee in front of your table. Mayan coffee is a mix of liquor, vanilla ice cream, coffee and flame. It is best to share this 500+ calories dessert. Ask for Styrofoam boxes and fill them with food \u2013 for picnic, eat by the pool or even take it to the airport for in-flight meal (since most airlines do not provide complimentary meal). Rooms ========================= Our room rate was $318 per night and we received $1,500 resort credit with 5 night stay in the Deluxe room. When we checked in, they could not upgrade our room. They said the room upgrade was based on availability. On the third day, I asked again about the room upgrade. The key here is PERSISTANCE. Finally, they let us upgrade to Suite on the ground floor using the resort credit ($140 upgrade fee per night). Later I was told by the room service that the suite has actually been empty since we checked in. Of course, suite is much better than deluxe. It has separate living room, two TVs, two fridges, liquor dispensers in 3 cabinets. You can host a private party at the extra-large veranda that can easily fit 8 guests or more. Tours ========================= I recommend taking Chichen Itza tour using the resort credit. It is a long trip, but worth every penny. If you want to buy souvenirs, do not buy from the shop that the tour agent brings you. For the best price, buy from the vendors at Chichen Itza. There are numerous (800+) vendors around Chichen Itza selling mostly the same stuff. Practice your haggling skill with them. It is always a good idea to carry MXM (Mexican Peso). As a general rule, if the price is in USD, you should pay in USD, not MXM. In my experience, the vendor offered the product in USD, but when I was about to pay, they converted the price to MXM with poor exchange rate (worse than big banks). Do your math. Before the trip, I did some research about the full day tour to Tulum organized by Palace resort. This tour is accompanied with lunch and snorkel in Xel-H\u00e1. As I found out, they omitted Xel-H\u00e1 for cost-cutting reason. So, basically you spend couple hours in Tulum, then they drop to at Adventura Cove Palace for lunch and 2 hour afternoon free-and-easy. If I have known that the itinerary was changed, I would not take the tour. Lobster Dinner ========================= One way to cash out the resort credit quickly is to have a lobster dinner. Don\u2019t faint - the price is $159 per person. Our group had the lobster dinner together accompanied by $195 champagne. Here is menu: Seahourse - juicy clam scallops served with tuna fish tartar on a delicious puff pastry (entr\u00e9e), Real Cream Soup \u2013 a delightful combination of asparagus cream soup and crunchy masago fish eggs in lime vinaigrette (soup), Sunset \u2013 an exquisite Angus Beef fillet perfumed with Port and garnished with lobster tail served in beuree meunier au Cointreau and Napoleon style vegetables (main course), Chocolate Delicacy \u2013 a fine combination of soft chocolate and strawberry mousse in a crunchy basquet flavored with sambucca (dessert). Without doubt, the dinner was excellent, but is it worth $159? So far, the best dinner in my life was at Al Iwan restaurant, Burj Al Arab, Dubai, UAE (see my previous review of Burj al Arab in Dubai, UAE). If I rate it 10, then the lobster dinner at Playacar Palace is 6. Ironically, the lobster dinner costs 50% more (food at Burj al Arab was about $100, drinks extra). Conclusion ========================= Location is the main reason that we stay at Playa del Carmen Palace. It is close to shopping area, ATM and the ferry to Cozumel. All-inclusive experience at Palace resort is superb, especially if you like to drink (liquor dispenser is available in the room). Restaurant and bar staff is very nice and friendly but front desk staff is reluctant to upgrade the room, unless you are persistent. The idea that I stay in Playa del Carmen and I can enjoy the amenities in other Palace resorts, e.g.: Cozumel Palace, is delightful. At home, before you arrive at the hotel, think carefully what you are going to do with the resort credits. Certain tours are not scheduled every day, so plan ahead. For the best value of your stay, you need to simply utilize the entire resort credit. Our resort credits were used up for tour, spa, lobster dinner, photo, and room upgrade. Duty Fee Shop, Cancun airport ========================= Several liquors at the duty free shop are cheaper than Pennsylvania. Prices are in USD. Beware that if you pay with Amex, the price is converted to MXM. Don\u2019t forget the foreign transaction fees charged by the credit card companies. But I think it is still cheaper to buy. Liquor-filled chocolates are overpriced.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA-USA", "Title": "\u201cGetaway !!\u201d", "Author": "Joe D", "ReviewID": "UR121499452", "Content": "This resort is on the BEST stretch of beach in the area.

The empty bars, beach cots, and tables in restaurants disputed that; I would generously give it about 2/3 occupied. Good points were the cleanliness, upbeat and friendly attitude of the serving staff, and - due to low occupancy I would think - availability of good tables in restaurants and beach cots. Food was quite good but not a lot of variety. The daily buffet became a little boring after three days, and the theme restaurants (Italian..sort of, and Asian...sort of) were just OK. We used $350 of credits for the Romantic Beach Dinner of lobster and champagne on our last night there, and would only recommend it if, like us, you had a slug of credits which would otherwise go unused. There was construction/repair going on, but they started up at a reasonable hour and quit early, so we were never disturbed by it. On the beach or out touring. A big plus for us was the proximity to the extensive Playa del Carmen 5th Avenue shopping district. We have stayed at some of those huge but isolated resorts, and really enjoyed being able to enjoy a change of scene and some local color with just a very short walk. We really enjoyed the tours to the Mayan ruins at Coba and at Chichen Itza, both \"free\" using hotel credits. Book early for these, as you will be riding a smaller bus or van to shuttle to a larger Palace resort to join the full-size bus. Coba will use up most of your day, Chichen Itza will take from 0800 to 1900, but is worth it - it's been deemed one of the seven modern wonders of the world along with the Great Wall, Machu Picchu, etc. (A big thank-you to Cristina of the customer service crew, who acted fast to help us get on the Coba tour after we booked late!)

This was hardly an inconvenience because the weather was great all week except for 2 days. The Playacar Palace is a very small but elegant property. The location is the best as it is right on the beach and 1 block walking distance to 5th Ave shopping & the Ferry Pier to Cozumel. This is the main reason we chose this hotel, the convenience!

(The staff there were also great) The spa is not on property but it wasn't very far and they provided a complimentary transfers. They did offer a short list of tours but we didn't want to be gone all day so we declined that option. We did, however use part of the credit for the romantic dinner on the beach (even though it was a girls get a way retreat). It was very nice to experience & I highly recommend it for couples. They only have 3 restaurants, Asian, Italian and the buffet restaurant but all 3 were great! The buffet was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and they had much to chose from. The Italian and Asian restaurants were open for dinner and no reservations were needed. The Italian restaurant had the best Filet Minon, I had it 2 nights in a row and it was delicious! They have 3 bars and I must say we spent most of our time at the pool bar. They showed the MLB World Series Games in the Luna Lounge which I enjoyed as I am a Texas Rangers fan. Next year Rangers!! We took the ferry to Cozumel one day ($42 round trip each) and was able to enjoy lunch and drinks at the Cozumel Palace which was about a 10 minute walk from the pier. Watch out for street vendors, they are very pushy! It was too windy for any snorkeling which was a bummer since this is the place to snorkel. On the 4th day we were told they were evacuating us to the Aventura Spa Palace because that property is much larger and is able to withstand the winds much better than the Playacar Palace.

Since our flights were cancelled on Friday we contacted Playacar Palace to see if we could stay there the last 2 nights and unfortunately they were full so we had to stay at the Aventura Spa Palace. Aventura does provide complimentary daily transportation to Playa del Carmen so we took advantage of that on Saturday. We were able to spend all day with our new friends at the Playacar Palace and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The staff welcomed us back and everyone made us feel like we were back home.

This smallish resort (by the all-inclusive standards) of 210 rooms was about 50% capacity, with a couple of weddings during our 7 nights stay. Food and drinks were great...beautifully presented and tasty. I loved the breakfast and lunch buffets, and there are three sit-down dining options at night. Italian, International and Asian. All were great, but I especially loved being seated outside by the pool for my service with Internatioanal fare. The Mexican dishes were authentic and yummy! Poolside was great...cool breezes, a view of Cozumel and the ferry pier, and great drinks with attentive service from the bar servers. Occasional games, good choice of music (varied), beach volleyball every afternoon, and large selection of loungers in the water, on the beach, and under some trees. The ocean breezes were constant and cool in October, and we were lucky to miss some major storms. it is always a bit of a risk to take advantage of the good pricing in the hurricane season. Our first room was in the ocean view category, with a sliding door floor to ceiling and only a step-out balcony, no chairs or table. Mid-week there was a water pipe break over our bathroom sink, and they moved us to a room that gave us a better sunrise view and view of the pool (right side of building where the concierge class rooms are). Top floor is great...request this side when you check in. Can be a tad noisy if a party is below you at the pool bar, though, so not if you are an early to bed person! The beach is amazing...great restoration done. To the left is the pier ferry to Cozumel ($26 pp TRT) and quick walk to all the shops and nightlife in Playa del Carmen (Senior Frog's is right there) and to the right is all private homes for at least a mile, so very quiet, private beach experience. Wonderful beach to walk or run, and some great shelling, too! The $1500 resort credit is tough to use...that's a lot of money! Spa was a short drive away...just make an appointment and they will pick you up at least every 15 minutes or so. Golf course got great ratings (that's where the SPA is) but we didn't play this time. Some excursions are inlcuded with credit, but have to make those reservations on site. You can't go wrong...go to Mexico! The Mexican folks are SO much fun...and this hotel will take VERY good care of you.

They have 3 restaurants (Mexican/Italian/Oriental) Mexican is best for Breakfast, Italian for Dinner and Oriental just sucks!. The Rooms are better than expected, very very clean, every room has a Jacuzzi and a balcony, LCD TV and a mini fridge full with soft drinks, it also has a stocked minibar with upside licor bottles, it works like a soft drink dispenser. The Pool is somewhat small, considering its shape and a lot of very shallow spots. The ambiance is more European and Mexican focused, Pool staff speak English, but not enough to establish interesting conversations. So if you are american, and love \"all american atmosphere\" people shouting, drinking tequilas like there is no tomorrow, and having 100% American Music, this might not be the place for you. The Beach is Beautiful, and just 50 steps to reach it!. Also you have the 5th Avenue (Quinta Avenida), just a block away!. It runs for about 12 Blocks, and it offers a lot of entertainment; Discos, Bars, Restaurants, Souvenir Shops, etc. You also have several Dry Cleaning And Laundry businesses a few blocks away, you can even called them and they will pick it up and deliver your cloths for free. a weeks of soiled cloths will come up to 6-8 dlls! (Wash, Dry and Packed) Never pay the Hotel's laundry fees Fees! If the hotel is Offering Credit on your stay, it will only cover the following destinations (Chichen Itza, Tulum, Coba, Isla Mujeres, Wet and Wild, Swim with Dolphins and Spas) Take in Mind, that this tours are owned by the Hotel, so they can will do whatever is their power to squeeze some more pennies from you. Tours Fast Recap: Chichen Itza: 2 Hour Stop and Buffet at a souvenir Shop in the middle of nowhere at 11 am! You justa had Breakfast!!! then 4 hours to Get to Chichen itza, (Only 2 hours at the Park!!!) Tulum: Very near to the hotel, long walk to get to the ruins, then you are set loose after 30 mins, But the beach is beautiful!!!! Also, 1 hr stop at a souvenir shop at the return. Coba: My Favorite!, 2 hrs Drive, very interesting walk on the ruins, then Food at the Buffet was the best that I had in all my 2 week vacations!. The Cochinita Pibil is out of this world! (Spicy Pulled Pork) Isla Mujeres: 1 hrs Drive from Hotel, then 45 minutes Boat trip to the Island. If you are planning to spend all day in the island, this trip is not for you. The trip consist is dropping you at an entertainment ceneter where you can swimm with dolphins, sting Rays, or Snorkle. But never it is intended to know the island. Buffet is also included. (Not very good) Wet and Wild: it is like Knotts Soak City, it includes anything you can drink or eat inside the Park, 2 hours tops, you done ever ride. Dolphin Swim: The tour is intended a place that is in the middle of nowhere, but you can ask to have it transferred to the dolphin Swim spot inside Wet and Wild! Two activities in the same park on the same day.

The hotel is very pretty. Everything is painted white to keep it simple, elegant, and I would imagine to keep costs low as it is a timeshare property and all-inclusive. When we arrived we were given wristbands and told if we lost them it would be $75 each. I have a 7 year old. I was glad we were done with all our sports and adventure activities, because I could just imagine somehow losing his bracelet or even mine. $75 just seemed ridiculous. We also had trouble with needing a voucher to prove we had our reservation paid for through our travel agent--but that was more the travel agent's fault. While this is an all-inclusive and in theory the tips are included, they really aren't. Everyone but the wait staff still expected tips, so please budget for this (and keep little bills! We were running out of small bills at the end of our trip, but I had a back up stash of $1 US). We had an instance where the valet brought bags to my parents\u2019 room and my parents only had $2 USD on them so they offered that believing they were extra-tipping the valet as tips were included. He flat out said to them \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d. When we asked for cokes (instead of Pepsi) to be brought to the room, the attendant hung out and walked out very slowly waiting for his tip, but booked it when we gave him some money. So they do indeed expect tips. The ladies at the pool bar though are awesome and lovely and we *wanted* to give them extra tips. We were able to use our credit ($500 credit for 3 nights and $300 went to the upgrade) to upgrade our room. We were put into a huge suite (#100) on the 1st floor with double beds, lots of extra seating, and a huge veranda with 2 loungers and a set of table and chairs with a great view of ocean and not the pool. Based on the floor plan on the hotel website, our room looks bigger than a honeymoon suite, so maybe it was a governor's? Anyways, it was large, clean, and worked out well for us. I would highly recommend this suite for travel with children. There were full size toiletries available--Biosilk including shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, sewing kit, etc. We first felt guilty but then really liked being able to take whatever we wanted from the minibar. If you do not like the selection in the minibar, then you can call and ask request different soda cans/ juice boxes. They had a full range of both Pepsi and Coke products (but I did not see Dr Pepper FYI). On the side of the TV, there were drawers you pulled out holding full bottles of alcohol for you to make mixed drinks with. And full bar accoutrements. The only thing missing was ice\u2014the ice machine was way down the hall. On our arrival day I had skipped breakfast as I had been SCUBA diving, so I hit the lunch buffet famished. We\u2019d also had been eating at local eateries for a week, so I was ok with international/ American food. The cheeseburger, salad, soup, and sides we ate were all very good. There are a lot of options that pleased my 7 year old as well. They even had ice cream. I found breakfast just as convenient: omelet station, waffle station, plus everything else you can imagine including fruits, yogurts, cereals, Mexican dishes, breads, etc. Picky eaters should be fine. Because we were there for a wedding, we spent 2 of our 3 nights in private functions eating there. We spent the 3rd at the Asian restaurant. Our dinners were quite miserable. They were presented beautifully, but universally the group was disappointed in the food. I felt that had we eaten in the main buffet restaurant for dinner, the food would have been ok. I would discourage you strongly not to eat at the Asian\u2014we were a party of 10 and ordered almost 1 of everything. Nearly nothing was edible. My father\u2019s wonton soup had no wontons in it. The Thai soup was like a chicken and vegetable soup. There was nothing Thai about it. I ordered a noodle dish and the noodles were rock hard. We laughed and we\u2019ll never forget the experience. But we weren\u2019t exactly less hungry. We found the drinks at the bars to be good, but inconsistent. I ordered a dirty monkey about 12 times and all 12 times it had different ingredients. At one point they didn't have bananas so they used coconut instead without telling me. I'm glad I'm not allergic to coconut. But if you have allergies, quiz them every time you order something on what is in the drink as it can change. We used the spa credit and the spa facilities are very nice. They have a very nice hydrotherapy area. There are 2 saunas (one wet, one dry) and 3 small spas. The hottest you only submerge your feet, a lukewarm you sit in with massage jets, and a cool refreshing pool. There are also pool showers for you to rinse off in addition to the locker area, restrooms, and shower/ dressing area. They provide shampoo, conditioner, lotion, fair dryers, combs, hair spray, etc. in addition to the usual robes and slippers. I had a massage and it was lovely. Additionally, there is a eatery at the golf/ spa building you eat lunch or get a drink in. You catch the spa/ golf shuttle from the main lobby about every 15 min except lunch apparently. I tried to leave at noon, but the driver was on lunch. When another couple joined me, they decided to call a cab for us at their expense to get us back. It was handled nicely. At night they had shows and we caught to of them: one was Brazilian drums and fire show which was quite cool and the other a \u201ccircus\u201d vaudeville act that even had small dogs performing. They were nice and you can see the effort they put into the social activities. The wedding was done very nicely and professionally too. On the transportation: if you are a family of four just take a taxi. We had issues making our 7 AM flight. Our shuttle booked through Palace resorts at the hotel never showed. 40 minutes after the pick up time I had run out of patience and went and found taxis on the street and they drove up to our lobby. The guest services worker in the lobby eventually after much drama paid the taxi driver. When I asked him the cost before the hotel ever got involved, he told me $60 USD. We paid Palace something like $20-25 each x5. Even with tip, a taxi was by far more affordable and on time. Both the attendant in the car port and the guest services worker didn\u2019t want to acknowledge that the shuttle was late because it was picking up guests at other Palace resorts. They eventually did. We had been told the day before the shuttle would only come to our hotel and maybe the Moon Palace up in Cancun. Obviously this isn\u2019t the case, so I recommend to call your own taxi. By the way, while this resort is at the end of 5th and that's nice, this side is super touristy and you need to get to basically walk past 10 Norte to get to the more normal drag. The street is still touristy but the mix of people changes: less Americans and more Europeans and Mexicans. Overall, the resort was ok. We enjoyed the wedding, our family, and the view but you can get that at a lot of other places.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBEST WEDDING/VACATION SPOT EVER!!!!\u201d", "Author": "mrangel0304", "ReviewID": "UR119124213", "Content": "Stop looking & book.

It didn\u2019t take long for us to realize it was a blessing in disguise. Flights to Cancun were more plentiful and affordable than Cozumel and the resort was immaculate. Every one of our guests told us that the Playacar Palace exceeded their expectations. The rooms and grounds were kept spotless and the service was unbeatable. The staff engaged guests through activities such as: volleyball, water polo, water aerobics, and other competitions. The nightly entertainment was also enjoyable to most and included: Casino night, Break dancing, Salsa dancing, a Fire show, a Circus, karaoke night, and Michael Jackson Tribute show. Professional pictures were taken of guests during such events and activities in which could later be purchased with your resort credits. Guests also used the resort credits to enjoy the spa (was absolutely amazing), golf (beautiful grounds), the dolphin swim (fun time!), lobster dinner (was ok), and wine upgrades (in which can be taken home). Our guests also enjoyed being so close to Carlos & Charlies, Senior Frogs, the Ferry to Cozumel, and 5th Avenue shopping district. Several of us ventured to Cozumel and visited the Cozumel Palace. Although the Cozumel Palace was equally as beautiful and also had great food and activity options, it doesn\u2019t have a beach, in which we loved about the Playacar Palace. Some said that shopping in Cozumel was also better. However, being on the mainland gave us so many more off-resort options. We went deep sea fishing, which was only about a mile out. Our boat caught a 45lb Wahoo and the resort cooked it for our group. They made ceviche, soup and filets. Each one was better than the next. They didn\u2019t charge anything either. This was a great experience and an excellent addition to our already great dinner in the Asian restaurant. On Sunday afternoon, the Luna Lounge was closed, yet, we were able to set watch the Redskins game while servers brought us beers every 10 minutes, along with wings and anything else that we could possibly want. During the trip, we tipped here and there to show our appreciation, although it was certainly not expected. More about the Playacar Palace: Breakfast buffet was standard, but good as expected. The sushi was excellent and they even brought you things you didn\u2019t order. The Italian restaurant was amazing, especially the pizza. In the Italian restaurant, we had a wonderful apple dessert, while other guests had a banana one that was made right in front of us. Now, about the wedding experience\u2026Marlyn Tobon was our wedding sales rep and in the beginning, we feared that she was not responsive enough, but we later understood that our wedding was planned 10 months in advance and there were many weddings occurring much sooner with less time to plan. We also had some initial glitches with the booking website, but it was cleared up in a reasonable timeframe. So remember to be patient. As mentioned earlier, our wedding was all set for the Cozumel Palace, but as flight options disappeared only 3 months before the big day, Marlyn acted quickly and aided us in transferring everyone and all of our details to the Playacar Palace. She was also very accommodating, patient, and professional towards all of our guests, including our \u201crookie travelers\u201d. Wilma was our wedding coordinator in which we did not begin correspondence with until about 60 days before the wedding. The bride-to-be was a little nervous about the time constraints, but Wilma ensured that everything would go smoothly, and she was right. She was very professional and responsive to all needs. The wedding was on the 3rd floor terrace since we wanted the privacy and if necessary, protection from any weather related issues. The space is small and isn\u2019t very attractive leading up to it, but once everything is in place, it\u2019s astounding. Originally, the reception was going to be held at the South Solarium (by the pool), but last minute was changed (thankfully!) to the North Solarium in which is a larger space towards the opposite side of the resort (closer to the 3rd floor terrace). The North Solarium is more secluded than the South Solarium. We decided to go with the complimentary wedding package and would supply our own decorations and/or purchase a la carte. We had a violinist, in which did pretty well and was able to play a wide variety of music, including one song that wasn\u2019t on her list. We brought our own alter arrangements and centerpieces, but Wilma along with the wedding party made certain that they were in place and returned following the event. The bouquet (orange, yellow, and red lilies) and boutonniere (yellow lily) supplied in the complimentary package was beautiful. We also used this bouquet as the toss bouquet. The staff, especially Wilma, is willing to do anything to make your day the most memorable event of your life. Overall, this resort was great and going in off-season really made our group feel special. The only negative thing is the elevators are really slow, but after all the good food, taking the stairs will help.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey", "Title": "\u201cI MUST ADD....\u201d", "Author": "tannedmom", "ReviewID": "UR118251267", "Content": "I also want to mention something I had left out on the review I posted yesterday...

The rooms are all basically the same and nice. Some have a slightly better view of the ocean which is worth while if you can get.

We had a free $1500 resort credit so upgraded to a sea view, a photo session with 15 photo's on a CD, plus two upgrade bottles of wine. Also a beach romantic dinner, just as we sat down the skies opened up and ruined it. Not the hotels fault, but the the romantics got lost as they sat us in the buffet restaurant. Now bear in mind we had dressed the part but were seated in one half of the restaurant with folks in bathing suits. We had our own waiters so my comment would be WHY could they not have taken us to the empty part, separate from all the others it was empty??? with room enough to separate the four couples even, I would have requested a refund had I actually paid cash. I am not a buffet person but pleasantly surprised at what was available, and the willingness to provide additional items. Both the Italian & Asian were very good, no complaints accept dress code which is non existent. I enjoy dressing for dinner, I do not consider myself a snob but some people have no idea. Had we not just about finished our dinner in the Asian one evening there could have been a problem, either for the head waiter or ourselves, as we do not appreciate looking at the crack of someones rear end as we dine. I will attempt to post a shot of it. The greatest asset's of the resort is in it's people, I never came across one that I could be negative about, ALL were appreciated, thanks. The other asset, LOCATION, LOCATION, so easy to go out on the town. One other observation why is it so difficult to get a good Anjeo Tequila in a Mexican hotel.

I had never been to Mexico with the exception of Ensenada on a cruise during spring break. I assure you that does not count. With that being said, I found this to be an excellent vacation. I went with my boyfriend and his family, 11 of us in total. My boyfriend had been there before and tried to explain to me what to expect from an all-inclusive resort on the turquoise waters in Mexico. It was very hard to wrap my mind around the concept of all-inclusive alcohol and food. Needless to say, I was not prepared for what was to come. As soon as we got off the plane we had a shuttle service waiting to drive us all to the resort which was roughly 45 minutes away. As soon as we got there we were greeted with champagne (nice touch). We checked in and received our wristbands! Boy, how I miss my wristband! The wristband was like the golden key that gave you access to virtually anything you wanted in all of the Riviera Maya (not exactly, but that's how I felt at the time). We checked into our room which was centrally located to all of the bars, restaurants and pool. Our room was decently spacious, and well-decorated. The shower was one of my favorite parts of the room. It had a nice big shower head and a bench to relax on after one too many tequila shots. (Also called caballitos, Gerardo informed us). Our first night for dinner we went to the buffet style Mexican restaurant. We absolutely loved it! We had tacos made for us on the spot by the extremely friendly staff. We loved the rice and beans, and we began to take full advantage of the all you can drink Don Julio! It was truly an excellent experience. After dinner a few of us went next door to Senor Frogs and got a feel for the local scene. We didn\u2019t stay long, however seeing as how we had endless amounts of food and drinks back at the hotel. Over the course of the week, we went zip lining, swam with the dolphins, rode ATVs, went golfing, frequented the beautiful ocean and swim-up bar, had a romantic lobster dinner on the beach, played numerous card games in the main bar, squeezed five of us into the Jacuzzi in our room, played: beach volleyball, volleyball aquatico, tequila volleyball, beach futbol, and participated in water aerobics. The staff exceeded my expectations! The Italian restaurant was pretty good (especially the filet), as was the oriental restaurant; however we really enjoyed the Mexican buffet the best as they made everything fresh and in front of you. Gerardo was our favorite employee, we really enjoyed talking to him and he quickly learned our names and our drink of choice \u2013 caballitos de Don Julio. It was truly an EXCELLENT vacation, and all 11 of us didn\u2019t want to see it end. The hotel was beautiful and the proximity to the ocean and the local shops was perfect. It was on the smaller side, but with 11 people you wouldn\u2019t want it to be any bigger.

My friend and I needed to take a much-needed girls vacation that included some spa. We originally booked our stay at the Adventura Spa Palace not realizing it was mainly for honeymooners or families with small children (Adventura Cove). We are NOT honeymooners \u2013 we are two single girls that wanted to meet people and socialize...on a beach. So after spending ~$600 of our resort credits with a wonderful first day at the spa followed by an afternoon by the pool, we decided to hop over by bus to Playacar Palace the following day for some beach fun. When we walked into the hotel, we were speechless. It was GORGEOUS! White marble floors... Flowing white curtains... Views of the white sand and turquoise water... Right out of a postcard. We decided right then and there that we wanted to switch hotels to be closer to the action. Playacar is steps away from the trendy nightlife and local shopping strip. It is also beach neighbours with Senor Frogs and right next to the pier that goes to Cozumel. Literally a 5 minute walk. So, expecting some sort of debate, we approached the front desk to ask if it would be possible to switch resorts. \u201cNo problem!\u201d she says.....What?! In shock, we enjoyed our beautiful afternoon at the beach and switched resorts the following day, getting upgraded to an ocean view room with two beds and a balcony. This was the beginning of our best vacation EVER. The beauty of Playacar is that there are only 208 rooms, so the service is impeccable. The staff are so well-trained to please their guests that even when we broke some late night \u201crules\u201d to go swimming in the ocean at 2am, the only reprimanding comment we got was, \u201cPlease don\u2019t smoke in the towel hut\u201d as we were borrowing towels to take to the beach (my friend has a cigarette in her hand at the time). Instead of kicking us out of the ocean, a security guard merely observed us from afar to make sure that nothing happened. We felt free. During the day, we didn\u2019t feel pressured to participate in the pool activities.... but they did look fun. We became friendly with the staff and were really impressed at how \u2018Super Eric\u2019 and \u2018Crazy Gabriel\u2019 \u2013 as they like to be called \u2013 interacted with the guests. It wasn\u2019t cheesy pool games. It was perfect. The music was also great \u2013 a fun mix of hip hop, oldies, and pop \u2013 and we went into town with them one night and had a blast. The waitresses were also passing by every 10-15 minutes or so to ask us if we wanted anything... You never had to leave your spot if you didn\u2019t want to. The food was also amazing. Who knew! I\u2019ve been to a few all-inclusives before, but the food was never as good as at Playacar. I just wish they had more guacamole during the lunch buffet. There was an Italian restaurant on site, only one, and it was phenomenal. We ordered Fettucini Arrabiata and Filet Mignon one night... and being foodies... we were SO impressed. The meat was perfectly medium rare, the pasta sauce was spicy; they even gave us a dipping plate with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Curious, we asked about the chef. He was authentic Italian \u2013 from Milan. Of course. I could go on and on about how amazing Playacar Palace Resorts is, but I\u2019ll stop here. Basically, it was really fun, and if you\u2019re looking for a good time with friends in a beautiful resort, steps away from the action, with cool staff, great food, and a beautiful beach.... look no further.

We stayed for a week and enjoyed every minute. As for a bit about us, we are 29 and 34, foodies from NYC, travel to Mexico once or twice a year, and cruise, and visit other Caribbean land vacation destinations as well. We love a bargain, but appreciate great quality and service. And, while we love to be pampered, we also dig taking local buses and eating where the locals eat. Room We stayed in room 341. This was a honeymoon suite and had an incredible ocean view. The balcony was large with a table and two chairs, as well as two lounge chairs on it, with tons of space to spare. There were two rooms, a foyer with a table and two chairs, a living room with a couch , table, flatscreen tv, dresser w/ fridge and minibar in it and then the bedroom. Marble all over. The bedroom had a comfortable king bed a closet stocked with robes and slippers, a dresser with a tv, coffee set up, mini bar, fridge, and a few drawers in it, also the big jacuzzi was in the bedroom as well. The bathroom, as others have mentioned there's no door to the main bathroom area, and no full door on the walk in shower (with built in seat) but there is a door to the toilet area. Not that it really did much. I couldn't have cared less about that one detail. Service Some reviews I read here made it seem like the staff here is tripping over themselves to please you. That gets annoying to me, so I'm glad that's not the case. Every staff member we encountered was pleasant at worst. Friendly and outgoing/funny at best. Always efficient, and always professional. There were some stand out servers that really made us feel special though. We are tippers, so I'm not sure if that impacted service. We were treated very well from day one before the tips were given so... Pool I didn't much care for the pool here (though we used it every day) just because it felt too small. Now, the resort was no where near capacity, and the pool wasn't crowded by any means, but just FELT small. I know I'm sounding quite nitpicky. Service around the pool was wonderful. Beach The beach was beautiful. Only one out of our 7 days had a seaweedy beach. Other days it was clean, clear and had wonderful light waves to play in. The beach is kept clean, and if you lay out on the loungers to sun, Nora or one of the other awesome pool/beach service ladies will come around to get you drinks/snacks. You can walk along the beach as far down as you please. It's gorgeous in the morning when the sky is pink and orange from sunrise. Food The food here was OK. It wasn't amazing. And it wasn't terrible. It was definitely a step up from standard 4 star all inclusive food. It wasn't as good as the cuisine at Hacienda Tres Rios, but it was good. Freshly prepared items were best for me. You can have whatever protein you want grilled for you while you wait. Sushi restaurant was lacking (but I'm a sushi addict and live in NYC so I'm totally biased)....Italian restaurant was OK....Never did the buffet for dinner, but for lunch it was decent. Salad items, lots of variety, and again the fresh grilled items. Breakfasts were good, traditional with a few Mexican items thrown in as well. Of course the requisite eggs to order station. They had carrot juice which is my favorite, but it wasn't freshly pressed. (It was still yummy) Location This resort is in the perfect location. We love playa and have stayed in other resorts in cancun/riviera maya/puerto morelos, puerto aventuras, akumal, but not in playa proper. Playacar Palace is a few steps from 5th ave. You get the best of both worlds. The all inclusive resort, and the party town at your doorstep. Lots of overpriced shopping to be had, do yourself a favor and haggle, it's fun. Excursions We took a day trip to Cozumel to do an ATV tour which was tons of fun and a lot more adventurous than the ATV tours we've taken in Playa. We stopped in at the Cozumel Palace to spend the day after the tour. The vibe there was a bit more lively/drunk/loud, but it also felt a lot more cramped. The great thing about Cozumel Palace was the snorkeling right off the side of the hotel. It's deep! There's no beach there. The Mexican restaurant at Cozumel Palace was lovely, and service wonderful. They gave us a room to shower and change, and the rooms at Playacar Palace were definitely better. Cozumel Palace had more rustic looking rooms, but awesome water pressure in the showers :) We dove with Scuba Playa \u2013 the best dive shop in Playa! And we spent a day in Puerto Morelos on a snorkeling tour. (We rent a car and we buy our excursion tickets directly at the vendor, or discounted at walmart) 1500 Credit This credit was awesome. We did the dinner on the beach \u2013 it wasn't romantic as there were 4 other couples like 3 feet away in every direction. Service was super slow...we bailed after the main course after waiting half hour for dessert. I'm sure it's not like that every night though. We did a photoshoot. The photographer was nice and sweet, the photography was kinda blah. (I'm a photographer so I'm pickier than I should be) I loved having photos taken of my husband and I though. It was surprisingly more romantic than I expected. Spa / Gym I used the spa credits on a pedicure (it was decent), a facial (it was fantastic), and a body scrub (it was torture...but she gave a massage after so the torture was almost forgotten. I left there smooooth as a baby's butt. It was lovely. The service in the spa and the environment is really top notch. The gym is small but has just enough equipment and is empty. Perfect. There were more than enough bottles of cold water, and towels, the gym was clean and the equipment was in good condition. Honeymoon Special The breakfast in bed, not so good. The romantic dinner was excellent!! It's a secluded area in the Italian restaurant. Service was wonderful. BONUS: We were seated next to a couple who we watched get married the night before. They were drunk and fighting and threatening divorce at dinner. It was hilarious and so sad all at once. Turndown service came only 3 nights...weird. We didn't care. Randoms the courtesy shuttle to the gym/spa/golf comes about every 15 minutes massages in playa are longer, better and way cheaper than the spa at the resort the michael jackson show was great fun...but that michael jackson looked like he didn't want to be there. It was hysterical. I'm a big michael fan so I liked it nonetheless There are lots of areas at this resort to just sit relax and enjoy a drink or cappuccino, it's really a place to cool out and de-stress vs a party spot Overall I give this resort an A!

I picket this particular place because of trip advisor reviews however I was really disappointed in the qualifity of the resort and service at the front desk. we have been to several different brands of 4* resorts in last few years and this was by far the lowest quality. Let me start off by some positive experiences. The wedding coordinator was great. they know what they are doing and your wedding will start on time. everyone really enjoyed the wedding we had planned. Service from the stafff was also very good. if you tip them, then the service is exceptional. Food was hit and miss depending on the day and time you were there. they do try to customize to your requirments however the restaurants (both asian and italian) were slow and took 3 hrs to complete your meal. Asian restaurant I thought was better than italian. another positive aspect of this was that it was close/in town and walking distance to shops. spa facilities are off site but services are exceptional. Negetives - resort lacks front desk service. People are not very friendly. we had a big group there and there were some particular needs on joinging rooms for family with small children. they would not accomodate and had allocated rooms to people who have not even arrived. you asked to get something done and you would have to ask 3-4 differnent people before they fullfilled your request. Resort is not cleaned everyday. the maid came everyday and did a good job but resort property is poorly staffed for cleaning. Promotional dollers and spa booking - its really confusing how to spend promotional dollers. we tried to coordiate spa booking for the entire group and the spa coordiator only booked half of the appointments. i understand that appointments get booked but would have been nice to provide an alternate solutions. we also tried to book a group tour and was told that people can sign up when we got there. but when we got there we were told everything was booked. Manager however did help to resolve this after numerous compliants by allowing extra people on express tours. the promotional booking desk is always busy and slow. you can expect to stand there for 1-2hrs at any given time unless its early in the morning. Overall, after all the hassel of settling into the rooms, having 70ppl in this small resort was great b/c we were all able to hang out together. however its definitely not a 4* resort and service can be improved. if you plan on doing a wedding here and customizing to add your touch, remember it will cost you lot of money. their vendors are more expensive then in US and not as good quality. Its good enough for a beach wedding and you can really have a nice small wedding with their existing packages but it you add on, be ready to pay arm and leg.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atascadero", "Title": "\u201cIt was great.

I especially loved the proximity of everything from the rooms, to the restaurants, to the pool, to the ocean, to the shops nearby. The service was great. I mean, everyone was so nice, so personable, so helpful, and just made you feel like it was your resort only. I loved that is was a smaller resort and everything felt so comfortable. My husband and I went with our twin 15 year daughters, and we all LOVED this place. The ocean was warm and stayed shallow for a while and was not too rough. The pool was not huge and is not deep, but it was perfect for what we needed. The swim up bar was an added bonus. The two Activities Directors, Baxter and Gabriel, were a lot of fun. The $1500 credit offered was great and allowed us to go to Chichen Itza, Swim with the Dolphins at Dolphinaris, upgrade our room, drink a better wine, and get some nice pictures with a toucan. Chichen Itza was great, except for the aggressive trinket sellers and the fact that we really could have used an hour more to explore this great place. The dolphin swim was amazing. We went to the 9:00 session, as I heard this would be less crowded. There were only 5 people in our group so each person got really good time with the dolphins. The food at the resort was great. We ate most of our meals at the buffet, but did go to the Italian and Asian restaurants. The Asian was good, but very loud with the tile floor and the low ceiling. The Italian was more quiet and the Maya Coffee and Peach Flambe was a fun moment for dessert. The nightly entertainment was really good, except that the schedule is only posted at the lobby desks or the elevators....so we were kind of clueless the first two nights, as we always took the stairs. So, do I have any complaints? Not really, just some comments. Our room was called Superior Deluxe Ocean View (Room 346). It was on the far south point of the building so it looked south down the beach. It was a very nice view, that I probably would have called Deluxe. To me, Superior Deluxe would have had a straight on view to the ocean. I asked about this and it sounded like the better rooms in this category had only king beds and we needed two queens. We used some of our $1500 credit to upgrade to the Governors Suite (Room 414) which was just what we needed in terms of views and more space. This room was on the north inner side of the building so it's view was truly Superior Deluxe. The day before we checked out I went to purchase the toucan pictures with some of our credit. The lobby employee checked the computer and told us we had 42 points left. We bought 2 pictures. I then reviewed the sheet from the lobby employee and realized that we should have had 115 more points. After further review, the lobby employee realized we had been charged twice for a bottle on wine and we did in fact have another 115 worth of credits available. So, check your credits during your trip....and do the math yourself. And finally, two other observations. 1) This was an amazing place to go in Mexico and it is miles and miles away from all of the trouble spots you read about in Mexico. We felt safe the entire time and can't wait to go back here again. 2) The drive up to the Playacar Palace is not fancy like some of the other resorts, and the lobby is very plain, but don't let that discourage you. This place is truly wonderful. 3) At the airport, walk past the hordes of \"helpers\" that will come at you before you can get out of the airport. Find the Palace Representative, let him/her direct you to the right number stall where you will get your transportation to Playacar Palace. And yes, the vans we were transported in were top notch. If you go to Playacar Palace you will not be sorry. You will love everything about it and you will not want to leave!!!! By the way, it's located right at the ferry terminal to Cozumel so you can go there too, if you want, and spend some time at the Cozumel Palace. $15 per person each way. We did not do this, but probably will next time. Oh yea, one last thing. In the pictures on their website, it looks like the ocean comes right up to the pool and there is practically no beach. This is not the case. There is a good amount of beach between the pool and the ocean, but it is not so much that you feel like you can't go back and forth very easily. Honestly, this place is just perfect!!!!! I don't want to stop writing about this amazing place, Playacar Palace. Just go!!!

I could write a small novel about this resort, but I'll try to keep it to the nitty-gritty: Wedding- The ceremony was beautiful, to say the least. I wanted a beach ceremony, but the weather was threatening rain, so we moved to the terrace. Ladies- this spot is just as nice. And it saves $250 for the sound system as opposed to having the ceremony on the beach. The officiant mispronounced my husband's name multiple times, even after corrected... oh well. The staff did allow for our family to take pictures as well as set up a camera that takes video, which was very nice. We also purchased the basic photo package, which is not covered by vacation credits. The only wedding-related upgrades that you can purchase using vacation credits are entire \"collections,\" such as amber, sapphire, diamond, etc. I chose the complimentary package, so my only extras were the photo package and my mother's corsage. I had a small guest list, just immediate family, so we had our reception in the Italian restaurant, which was the perfect ambiance for a dinner reception. Edith was very nice in helping us plan our occasion. There are so many other things I would like to include, so if you have more questions, please email me: ----- Food- The buffet was amazing and had an incredible assortment of food each day. My husband and I had a private dinner in the italian restaurant prior to the wedding, and my main course -stuffed veal- was almost inedible. If you eat here, stick to basics as far as food items go. The food at the Japanese restaurant was so-so, and it took forever for food to come out to us. Rooms- We stayed in the honeymoon suite, which was worth every penny. Our room was huge, and our porch spacious with an excellent view of the beach. Our fridge was restocked daily, and the cleaning/turndown service was great. My only complaint was that there was no door on the shower... and it's supposed to be that way. But I get cold easily, so I had to make sure the room was at a warmer temp prior to showering. Pool and beach- fantastic. I didn't use the swim-up bar much, but there wasn't really a need, as the staff rounded to the chairs regularly to inquire about food/drinks. The beach was picturesque and the water refreshing and clear. The service was remarkable. As a Palace guest, one can visit other Palace resorts, so we took the ferry (super close to the resort) to Cozumel, and then walked to the Cozumel Palace (20 minute walk to your right). Be warned: There is no beach at this resort, but it has fantastic snorkeling! Overall hotel condition- The floors are hard marble, and it is hard to see where it is wet. I saw multiple people slip, so make sure your shoes have good tread. All the walls are painted white, which is probably not the best color for the resort. Very plain and boring. And it seems like the paint is apartment-grade, and the work is noticeably sloppy in some places. The roof of the lobby collapsed in a spot the night before we left, but it seems like they got the mess cleaned up right away. Resort credits- Purposefully confusing!!! If you don't ask a million questions and go from concierge desk to concierge desk, you could be ripped off. I feel like opportunities are withheld from guests to prevent from all the credits being used up during a stay. For example, my husband and I had NO idea that there was a Kodak desk near the check-in desk that we could apply resort credits to. We used this opportunity last-minute to get fantastic photos of the whole family. My cousin booked a facial at the spa for her last day, but since she didn't \"reconfirm\" at one of the desks the morning of, she lost her appointment.

Particularly, the bar servers are joyful and wonderful with their service when and where you need a drink. The resort only has 3 restaurants and one is a full-time buffet with the other two being an Italian and Oriental cuisine. I will have to say that I received my food well cooked and it was quite tasty. There are daily light entertainment programs around the pool area which are fun and a good distraction. At night, there was a Michael Jackson experience which was fine- not outstanding. There was also a fire dance which was excellent. The resort could use more live musical entertainment whether ethnic or just popular music. Most of the visitors are English speaking and from USA; so, one thing they could improve on is providing TV with American stations (speaking English!). Also, they could improve on their reception area by inclosing it and making it more opulent and welcoming. It's outside and can be quite warm for working with their representatives.

We have stayed there several times over the past couple of years and it did not disappoint this time at all. One of the Place Resorts, Playcar Palace is one of my favorites. We like smaller places where you can get to know and interact with the staff. Playacar Place at 250 something rooms is perfect for us. The location cannot be beat. Centrally located to attractions such as Xcaret, Xel-Ha, Explor, and natural areas such as Ya-Kul and Akumal Bay, you can be at these hot spots without having to spend an hour driving down from Cancun. Back to the hotel, the staff makes Playcar what it is, they simply try harder than other resorts, more so if you interact with them and ask for their opinions on the best meal to order or local customs or in our case language. My wife and I always try to work on our Spanish and ask for local slang, (try that Rosetta Stone). It's funny, the staff is working on their English and we are working on our Spanish in the same conversation. The restored beach is fantastic, you can walk for miles. If you are a fan of the night life, Playa De Carmen is literally right out the front door, (Playcar Palace is located next to the Cozumel Ferry Pier). Playa itself is a very cool x-pat, dive, art kind of town. It is cool but in a laid back non spring break crazy way like Cancun is. Great diving if you dive, great snorkling (go to Akumal Bay and snorkle with sea turtles - they come to eat the grasses, but please look but don't harrass). Watching the sun rise from your ocean front balcony having a cup of coffee is the definition of relaxation for me. If there are rooms that don't have a direct ocean view at Playacar Palace, I have not seen them. Be aware, the Palace Staff will try to get you to become a Palace member and will pay for your time (1-2 hours w/ travel time to Adventura Spa Palace), with Spa Credits. If you do not want to hear the pitch - just say no thank you. If you do, you can get a good deal on future travel. I resisted the pitch for years, but joined ended up joining a couple of years ago. It was a good deal for us, but that is a personal decision for you to decide. The hotel has every service you might need either on site or at the Golf Club House ( 5 min free shuttle bus ride) this ranges from, of course, golf, spa, day care, gift shop, rental car, trip scheduling, basically anything you need. The rooms are nice, with wet bar, large spa, comfortable beds and pillows (Various choices along with aroma therapy). I recommend Playcar Palace highly. I hope this review is helpful.

We relied heavily on reviews from tripadvisor in our hotel selection, so I felt we should return the favor. Overall, we loved our experience and wanted to highlight the many \"pros\" and a few \"cons\" from our stay. We arrived at the hotel around 5:00 and were escorted to the front desk where we received our first of many delicious margaritas. We were staying 5 nights so we received $1500 in resort credits. We used approximately $550 of this to upgrade to an oceanview room from one of their basic hotel rooms. (I would recommend saving money on the hotel room when you initially book your room and use the credits to upgrade as it would be very difficult to use all $1500 in credits otherwise.) My husband and I sat down with one of the concierges to use the remainder of our credits: $300 for massages at the spa- The massages were very relaxing $200-Tour of Tulum- This was the main reason we selected Mexico for our vacation. This tour was amazing! Tulum is absolutely beautiful, and while we were reluctant to visit the Xpu-Ha resort afterwards, it ended up being the perfect way to relax after a day of sweating in the Mexican heat at Tulum. $260: Photography Session: Helena did an amazing job! My mom even commented that these pictures were better than our wedding pictures. For this price we received 3 5x7 prints and all 60 pictures on CD with copyright release (make sure to ask for this piece of paper). This is a MUST DO! $190: Dinner with the Chef: This was a very neat experience, but I have to say the food was not the best. If you are desperate to spend your resort credits, then go ahead and do this, otherwise skip it, or plan to swing by the Asian restaurant afterwards and fill up on sushi. We checked into our room which had a fantastic view. A few comments regarding the hotel itself: The lobby is very simple but classy. The hotel shows some sign of age but overall is very clean and has beautiful grounds. Playacar Palace a very small resort compared to others but its location within Playa del Carmen allows for this, as everything you could possibly need is within walking distance. Since we had just finished a day of traveling we decided to go to the buffet restaurant for a quick dinner. This would be our worst meal of the entire vacation. We returned again for breakfast the following morning and after giving this restaurant 2 tries, we felt that was 2 tries too many. The food is bland, and left me still hungry. The food at Playacar Palace was fair. Skip the buffet all together. Order room service for breakfast. The italian restaurant was fairly decent. The asian restaurant was phenomenal! We ate there 2 nights in a row because we had been craving it all day. The menu is fairly large so you can do this and try completely different things. We spent the second and third day of the trips lounging by the pool and reading our books. The beach is beautiful and the pool, while small, is very relaxing. We did have lunch at Senor Frogs which was a lot of fun. We walked 5th Ave which is your typical touristy area. We had hoped to enjoy a leisurely walk as we looked at the shops but the vendors abrasive and loud personalities left us stressed out and wanting to get back to the hotel. My husband did buy a Cuban cigar in one of the shops. To this day, you can still hear him raving about it. He later bought one at the hotel, and while he said it was good, it did not compare to the one he found on the street. On our 4th day of travel we decided to catch the ferry over to Cozumel and booked a snorkeling tour with Andrea Tours (I think that's the name) . It had been raining off and on for the past few days so the waves were very rocky. I get motion sickness so you can see how this ended up for me. Despite getting sick in the middle of a beautiful reef, this experience was amazing! The fish, coral and wildlife is absolutely beautiful and it would be a shame to vacation in the Riviera Maya and not take advantage of the coral reef. One comment on the service at Playacar Palace:Perfection! I would have never dreamed a place could have such great service! Everyone was friendly, helpful, and would bend over backwards to try and accommodate you. We did tip housekeeping, bell hops, and some other staff members because we were just so impressed. The evening entertainment was always fun and my husband and I always worked our evening plans around these events to ensure we could attend. I would strongly recommend Playacar Palace and with the $1500 credits, it is a fantastic deal!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely AMAZING!!\u201d", "Author": "mookie1226", "ReviewID": "UR113157528", "Content": "This hotel was absolutely perfect for our first anniversary/babymoon! The $1.500 resort credit was so helpful and we were able to do things we hadn't planned on because of it!! We upgraded our room (prior to booking, so not using the credit) to the Concierge Level and, personally, I think it was worth it (even though my husband may disagree!). Our room overlooked the ocean and pool area and was on the top floor. The hotel wasn't too crowded despite having 4 weddings while we were there so there was plenty of room at the pool and beach. The staff was incredibly accommodating and the food was amazing! (Especially Terrazza, the Italian restaurant...who knew?!) There is a quick ferry that takes you to Cozumel right across the water (about 30 mins) that basically docks right at the Playacar Palace. We were able to use our credit for a round of golf, 2 massages and 2 facials at the spa, a romantic dinner on the beach for our anniversary night, and a photo session with our images on a disc. Everything else was included and we couldn't be happier! Only one complaint we had the entire time and that was with the airport transport. I would be cautious when booking your airport transfer through Palace Resorts. Getting to the hotel was no problem at all, we had a private shuttle with about a 45 minute drive right after we got off the plane. Coming back to the airport was a different story. We had to confirm our pick-up time 2 days prior to leaving. Our flight didn't leave until 4:30pm, but because our airport transfer was taking other people, we had to leave the resort at 12:00pm. The $92 you spend on the resort-provided shuttle is approximately the same as a taxi to the airport, so I would suggest doing that instead so you can stay at the hotel as late as need be (especially if you have a later flight!)

Our wedding coordinator was Laura, and she worked hard to ensure that everything about our wedding day was perfect; and that is exactly what it was. Although we got the Complimentary wedding package (which does not include any decorations over and above standard white linnens etc), she arranged to have teal napkins (that the resort usually uses in the Cafe del Mar) at our tables to match our wedding colors of teal and grey. She also had one of her staff set up decorations that we brought to the resort from home. If I had my professional photos back already I would post a picture to demonstrate just how beautiful they made everything. Also, during the wedding day, they set up private bars just for our parties (ceremony, cocktails, reception, afterparty) and all of the staff that worked them were so friendly!

They have 3 restaurants all right next to each other and less than 50 yards from the pool with an ocean view. As it typical with all Palace Resorts (I have stayed in 9 of them) the service is excellent. Super Dooper Erick, Sexy Livia, Dexter and Gabriel are an excellent entertainment crew and with a different theme every night it doesn't get boring. They make it a comfortable and fun atmosphere around the pool during the day and lobby bar at night. Pedro, Israel, Luis, Dominic, Sergio and many others on the restaurant team are excellent. I had one run in with the restaruant managers in the buffet Angel and one other male when I came in for dinner one night where they were rude in comparison to the normal service, but that is the only \"dust up\" I have ever had in all 9 stays at Palace Resorts. The inside and outside bars were great, Blanca, Fanny, Angel, Erika, Martha, Carmen, Perla, Gerardo and many others provided top notch service. You weren't without a drink or food anywhere in the pool area. I saw them serving the beach area as well but I didn't spend time in the chair area around the beach, only in the water and sand. If you like golf, the Playacar course is challenging and fun! Buy a few balls if you aren't dead straight because you have jungle and water off the fairways. Highly recommend playing if you like golf. They also have a spa and small gym at the golf course. I heard the spa was nice. Not like it is at Aventura and Moon Palace but definitely adequate without the size of hotel the other 2 are. Also, the ferry to Cozumel is less than a 3 - 5 minute walk from the hotel via the beach. $26 round trip for an adult and they pick up about once an hour before later in the day and last ferry return is 9pm.

With only one exeption, we have always stayed at an All-Inclusive Resort. Initially upon arrival at Playacar Palace we were a little disapointed with the lack of ambiance or grand entrance that we have seen at other resorts. The hotel itself could use a little paint here and there, however , our room was adequate and very clean. With that being our only disapointment let me go on to say this was one of the best resorts we have been to. We arrived a twosome with 39 employee guests to arrive 2 days later. Laura and Adrianna were our contacts for event planning and they did a tremendous job providing us with the most amazing cocktail party and dinner well above our expectations ( not to mention the smoothest group check in with food and drinks available to our guests). The food at this resort is great. The Italian restaurant has everything from a great filet to seafood and pasta with a pretty good wine selection as well. Great Sushi in the Japanese with wonderful presentation. People usually complain about buffet food, but no complaints here. If you didn't see what you wanted they would make you something fresh off the grill. Try the Steak and Shrimp Fajita's or Mahi Fish Taco's, they will make it and bring it to your table !! Just remember just because it is an All Inclusive does not meen stiff your server. A little tipping goes a long way so don't be stingy. I could go on and on, but last but not least , Super Duper Eric, Gabrielle and Baxter at the pool kept us laughing all day as well as entertained each evening with really decent shows. Pool and beach service is also an added bonus, Fanny at the pool never forgot what we liked or let us go too long without one. Location is another bonus, Fifth Ave is literally a block away !!

An example of this was the Jalousie Plantation in St Lucia, food was average but the location fantastic (still a great place and would recommend a stay). This was the first hotel I went to and actually ate the food 100% of the time instead of going out. They had a great variety which was very hard to get sick of. The location was more private but within walking distance to a market and a ferry to Cozumel(5 min). (You can also take a day trip to their sister hotel there and go snorkeling and eat for free). Locals tend to stay away from the beach but if you feel like to mingle, they are about a 5 min walk away. Entertainment by the pool was top notch, Super Eric always gets the crowd involved and the wait staff always ensured that we had a drink in our hand or if hungry food available. Entertainment at night they have a bar on site, or a bunch of bars in the market nearby. 5th street is about a 5 minute drive. Safety at night, no concern; had a ton of police patrolling to make people feel safe. We actually booked this hotel by chance since our friends were having a wedding at the Royal. If you are considering a wedding, I would recommend taking a look at the Playacar palace. You do not have a bunch of locals coming into your wedding like at the Royal that we saw. My wife did also unfortunately get hurt on an excursion on our last day( offsite). The medical response was top notch when we got back and instantly had people assisting her.

Everyone we encountered was smiling, friendly, happy, and fun! After checking in to our room we made our way to the buffet restaurant and met Roberto who proceeded to take my arm and walk me around. He was so happy and charming and had my sister and I smiling and laughing in no time! I am generally not a fan of buffets and never choose a buffet restaurant at home. However, at Playacar you will be pleasantly surprised at the fresh, wide variety of food choices on the buffet. The restaurant is air conditioned with windows that look out on the pool and the beach and it is extremely clean and well taken care of. In the evenings, the tables are dressed in white linen with linen napkins while at lunch the feel is more casual. I'm not a breakfast person so I can't comment on the breakfast selections. We also dined at the Italian restaurant one night and it was outstanding! Our server, Nestor, delivered an excellent bottle of iced down Chardonnay to our table and made sure our glasses were full throughout the evening. Even though the menu offers many great choices, Nestor had the chef prepare a special grilled salmon and a filet for our dinner. Both were excellent! The resort was only about 40% occupied during our visit so along with the attentive service, we didn't have to fight for a lounge chair at the pool or worry about making dinner reservations. Our pool experience was just as nice as our meal experiences and fun too! We met Gabriel and Baxter who kept us entertained with water aerobics, picture taking and Spanish lessons. You could participate in everything or nothing, it was totally up to you. The pool is right on the beach which I love plus the beach is perfect for taking nice long walks. While we were there, the ocean was a little too rough to swim in but beautiful to look at! The Playacar is a smaller resort with only about 200 rooms, so if you are looking for an intimate experience, this is your place! It is also right next to the ferry that goes to Cozumel where you have access to the Cozumel Palace (a sister property). We didn't make it over to Cozumel, but we did take the 15 minute taxi ride ($20) to Aventura Spa Palace to see what a larger resort experience would be like. Aventura is much grander and newer than Playacar but both resorts are equal in their service. It just depends on what you are looking for. Aventura has beach inlets but no beach for walking. That, for me, was the only downside that I could come up with. Our day at the Aventura pool was just as much fun as our day at Playacar. In fact, we had so much fun that we decided to stay for dinner on the beach, watch the fire dancers and then do some dancing of our own in the sand while a DJ played some great music! Again, so much fun! Overall, the Playacar Palace is a modest property. I really enjoyed not having to walk long distances to get to the restaurants or to the pool or beach. Our room was nicely appointed and very clean. We had two queen beds with a balcony and an ocean view. I loved the large walk-in shower and the fully stocked referigerator with soft drinks and beer. There were also large bottles of water placed in our room daily. At Playacar Palace you are also right in the middle of Playa Del Carmen, although you would never know it from inside the hotel. It was super convenient to walk out of the hotel lobby and within a couple of minutes be on the streets of Playa Del Carmen shopping. So nice and easy!

We've been to Riviera Maya numerous times and this was our favorite so far. ROOMS:Beds are comfy, all rooms have a jacuzzi and most face the ocean. We had a room on the first floor with ocean view but near the pool. It was perfect for us and we did not have any issues with noise, even during afternoon naps. Toiletries are top notch (Biosilk), housekeeping was excellent with making the room and for turn down. Each time we called for something it was delivered within minutes and each time we got a follow up phone call to make sure our needs were met! We had a noise from our toilet on the last night and they sent a plumber down within minutes who fixed it and then they even sent a housekeeper to clean up the bathroom right away. BEACH:Not much to say. This is a FANTASTIC beach. Few shells and seaweed when you are walking on the beach, soft powder white sand, warm water and NO ROCKS. This stretch of the beach is better than down by the Riu and the Reef because it is flat and not sloped. No hawkers and it is very safe. If you want to take a ferry to Cozumel you just walk over about 2 minutes. Senior Frogs next door but no noise issues. Also take to beach to walk into Playa town and 5th Avenue, will take you 5-10 min only. POOL:We've been to hotels with bigger pools but this pool is perfect for families. Only 3-4 feet deep and always was warm and clean. Lots of chairs with umbrellas and you can sit by the pool and still hear and see the beach. Has a baby pool too, about 8 inches deep. Lots of pool towels available and NO TOWEL CARDS which is a plus. RESTAURANTS:3. the main buffet which was excellent. always had fresh food and they were always making everything fresh instead of keeping in under heating lamps. they were also flexible to accomodate any requests, had different drinks and themes each night and TRULY we did not get tired of it after 1 wk, which is amazing for all-inclusive. they also have an Asian (momonohana) and Italian restaurant. We were not that impressed with the items on the Italian menu and actually preferred the buffet. Asian was fantastic and we had their tempura ice cream every night even when we ate in the buffet since the waiters were willing to get items from the restaurants for you. NO RESERVATIONS needed. Also enough varieties even for vegetarians. BTW 24h room service free of charge. ACTIVITIES:beach volleyball, water volleyball, aerobics, stretching and some crazy pool games. Nice music playing all day and not too rowdy. Perfect for families and couples. The entertainment team was great. Not too much evening entertainment. They had a Michael Jackson show which was good, a fire show and a Brazilian show. One thing I liked was that the shows were near the pool area on most nights so you could sit on a lounger, enjoy the warm breeze and watch the show. If you need a busier nightlife, go into Playa. Generally the resort was quiet in the evenings which is exactly what we wanted. They also have excellent tennis courts which are a 2 minute walk and we never had issues booking a time. They provided rackets and balls. SPA AND FITNESS:This in my opinion is the downside of this resort. It is such a pain to wait for 15 min for a shuttle both ways to get to the spa or the fitness center. They especially need to have an onsite fitness center so at least people can work out without the hassles of a shuttle. People don't use the spa everyday so they can handle a shuttle a few times. The spa is FABULOUS with great services. If you book a spa treatment, go an hour earlier or stay later to use the jacuzzi, steam, sauna and plunge pool. Spa has nice showeres and toiletries and it is easy to get ready there after your treatment. There is also a golf course at the spa which we heard was quite nice. SERVICE: You can't beat it. Never had a problem with check in, check out or anything. Bars made good drinks. They had a $1500 promotion for a 7 night stay which you could use for tours, spa services, bottles of taquila or photo sessions on the beach. We got two free massages, a romantic lobster dinner on the beach, 12 bottles of taquila and fabulous pictures printed and on a CD to take home. Here are the people who made a difference for us: Francisco from the kitchen; waiters Sotero, Rudolpho, Guadalupe, Jose and Enrique; kids club Livia and Damarise; entertainment super duper Eric and Baxter. They always remembered that we liked latte in the morning and cappucino at night! We have been to Dreams, Rius, Sandals, Barcelo etc and loved this the best. It was smaller but more personal and stress free.

Best all inclusive I have ever been to as well as some of my quest said the same thing, we all have experience traveling. I am going to write a long detailed review of this resort because I chose this resort from all the reviews on trip advisor therefore I feel I owe it to anyone thinking of visiting for pleasure or for a wedding. I will review the resort and wedding separately as I had 2 completely different experiences. THE RESORT!!! Food The food quality overall was great! I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. You have to realize that you are staying at an all inclusive and the resort is not a 5 star hotel. So don\u2019t pay any attention to the bad reviews. I had quite a few foodies staying at the resort and they were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. It\u2019s great that they have food at the pool bar for you to snack on through out the day if you don\u2019t feel like sitting down at the buffet. NO ONE GOT SICK! The water is also filtered. I brushed my teeth with it and was fine. I wouldn\u2019t recommend drinking because frankly, there is no need to since you have bottle water provided by the resort. Service/Staff Excellent! This is really what made the resort. EVERYONE went above and beyond for our guests. Pool service never left anyone without a drink in their hand. I had a mis-hap with my wedding dress on the way down and was nervous about sending it to the cleaners in Cancun or even letting the dress out of my site for that matter. I sent it reluctantly but when it came back it was perfect! Area Perfect location! 5th avenue & the ferry are just steps away! We ate out at an Argentinian steak restaurant(SUR i think it was called) about 10 minute walk on 5th avenue, FANTASTIC! We took the ferry to Cozumel and went to the Palace Cozumel, it wasn\u2019t nearly as nice as the Playacar. It had no beach and the buffet was more like a cafeteria. Plus, Cozumel was dirty compared to Playa Del Carmen. Spa The spa was great, I used the hair services & spa message. The hair service was, ok. I had a trial hair apt 3 days before the wedding. I recommend doing that. The girls spoke no english, there had to be a translator. The first time the girl did my hair it fell out by the time i got back to the resort. The second time (the day of the wedding was much better) I made it a point to tell her to use more bobby pins and she followed through with my request. The couples massage was wonderful, however wear or bring a bathing suit for the jacuzzi portion of the massage because you can use the sauna/steam room/ and shower before or after the massage. Rooms We stayed in a couple of rooms, not because there was anything wrong with them but the first time we didn\u2019t like the view(450) and the second time (550)we upgraded(with the points) to the honeymoon suite(443). They were all beautiful the first 2 rooms were mostly the same. The honeymoon sweet had the most beautiful view! The staff was so accommodating with us changing the rooms so many times, we got to know the bell hop very well (Leonardo), he was great! Rewards points This is a great promotion (not sure how much longer they are running it), but they also limited you on certain things. You can only use 300 of them on the spa, we upgraded because there was not much we could use it on. Some of our guests used it on the romantic dinner, they said it was something left to be desired for. Others used it on the photo session and some of the pictures, actually, came out pretty good. THE WEDDING!!!!!! Where do i begin!!! In the end the wedding was WONDERFUL... we ate, drank, danced and everyone had an awesome time. The decorations were beautiful and so was the ceremony. I had it on the terrace and at the north solarium (reception), if you do choose this place i HIGHLY recommend it, it was very private and you don\u2019t have other guests staring and hooting and hollering at you. (you know how tacky some people can be) And some people asked how I chose the Palace Playacar, simply, it was through trip advisor! All the wonderful reviews on the weddings and the resort were fantastic. I emailed a bunch of places in mexico not knowing where I wanted to have it and Palace resorts was the only place to get back to me in a timely fashion, I was sold. They have their wedding headquarters in Miami, Lauren was my room coordinator and was the main person I was in contact with, NOT my wedding coordinator. I booked my wedding a year in advance, they sent me their wedding package of what they have/had to offer and it looked GREAT. I thought this was going to be so easy! NEGATIVE. It should really be false advertisement. Because my \u201cwedding coordinator\u201d when she finally contacted me about 60 days before, barely answered my emails, gave me NO input and I ended up going through Lorena her BOSS to get any answers. Basically what you see is what you get in the packet and don\u2019t be surprised if they don\u2019t offer any advice or input. However, I chose the amber package and it was so beautiful. My brides maids dresses were a turquoise and I did hot pink and orange accents and it matched the decorations perfectly. I must of had bad luck with the wedding coordinators because I had 3 of them between the time I booked and the actual wedding. Wilma ended up being my final coordinator. If you get her, request another coordinator or cancel the wedding and choose someplace else. It was more stress trying to get in contact with her than it was packing for 8 nights and a wedding, it was unbelievable. Somedays she would get back to me right away other times i had to wait 3 days - a week. The way they do things is that they literally plan everything 3 days in advanced. As long as you have an idea of what you want from the packet you do all your planning 3 days before you get there. Also, they outsource everything, so your going to pay double the price if you go through them. On a side note, as a thank you to our guests we booked a catamaran cruise the night before the wedding. It was half the price. I definitely recommend doing that, it was so much fun and a great way for our guests to get to know each other before the wedding. The ceremony was beautiful. The reception- My friend took the photos and it was cheaper to have her stay at the resort to count towards the room nights and have her there as a guest than to go through their own people. Not to mention, she took photos all three days she was there, instead of hiring someone for 6 hours. We hired a DJ down there, not through the resort (Disco Movil). There was a little mis hap in the beginning but i don\u2019t know if it was his fault or the wedding coordinators. But over all he rocked out and we danced all night! The other wedding even came over to dance with us! The big issues that happened at the reception was that WE, the bride and groom, didn\u2019t have a place to sit! They put us at the wrong table because they thought that we would want the ocean view. IT WAS DARK! Wilma didn\u2019t communicate with the set up staff that we were suppose to sit with the wedding party. My mom sent an email the day before saying that this is where we were suppose to go. When I confronted her I got some lame excuse and so just dismissed it. Then an hour into the reception she left another lady (ana or analise) in charge, I don\u2019t quite remember her name. She was awesome. But I thought it was the wedding coordinators job to do that!?!?? In the end, I don\u2019t regret my decision to have a destination wedding at the Playacar Palace, everything was beautiful. However, I do wish I was prepared for the lack of responsiveness that I was going to receive from my \u201cwedding coordinator\u201d but it is Mexico and sometimes there is a tradeoff for great weather, great atmosphere, with great friends and good food.

We loved our service from Perla on the pool deck, Israel at the Mexican/International restaurant, Angela and Sarmi as constantly concerned hostesses, and Angel as sommelier and flaming desert chef at the Italian restaurant. 2. The Playacar Golf & Spa is a wonderful facility. You can take the 3-5 minute shuttle, or walk over in 15 minutes. The spa was smaller and quite nice. 3. One issue - One of the nights the Romantic Dinner folks were forced into the Luna Lounge due to the Fire Show on the beach. The Palace should have set them up on the beach near the show. 4.

But what it lacks in elegance, it makes up for in customer service. We worked with Aldenella (hope that is correct) for a wonderful spa afternoon for my daughter and a planned trip to Xel-ha. The shuttle to the Spa/Golf Course came and went about every 15 minutes as it was down the street and around the corner. It was immaculate! I'll go there again. I became ill and we had to cancel the Xel-ha tour must to our daughters dismay, but she was the most hospitable and worked very hard to get our monies back without fail. She was wonderfully accomodating. We did do the time share tour to Adventure Spa which is now both a family resort and half of it is adult only. Absolutely ornate with spanish theme and beautiful. Wonderful pool and lagoon for snorkeling. We just really missed the beach though and not interested in long-term committments. Back to Playcar, the rooms were standard two-queen size beds with all amenities and we used the $1,500 credit dollars to upgrade to an ocean-facing room that was wonderul. One minor thing we noticed was that there was a sewage odor in the hallway to our room, but it was fairly minor, and I think because of the semi inclosure it's possible proximity to that corner of the building. The view was worth it in our opinion. The buffet for lunch and dinner was was different daily and we all found selections. More than once the chef asked for input on things that we would enjoy and he was willing to add those recommendations, but we left full. The Japenese and Italian restaurants were very good. All servers and hostess' were wonderful and before week's end, knew our names. We did enjoy the Italian rest. the best. I really enjoyed the Mexican coffee there, and it's quite a show in itself. The evening entertainment was very nice, some nights better than others, but worth atttending non-the-less. Bed and pillows were super, I think the Palace Resorts must have made a change across their sites because as I recall, the Cancun Palace in 2009 had the usually typically hard beds and hard, flat pillows. No complaints there for us. The bar staff was very friendly as were the waitress. Everyone both in restaurants, bar and tour desk, Public Relations and photography were exceptionally nice and careing. I must say the housekeepers and maintenance never faialed to say hello as we met in the halls. While not an extremely elegant nor spanish-detailed, this more intimate setting suited our tastes.

The big plus is that Palace purchased this hotel on the beach and truly converted it into a luxury resort. We have stayed at Riu, El Dorado, Royal Hideaway and Aberostar Tucan, Allegro Playacar (as well as many hotels in town). One can pay more for the Hideaway - but the question is why? Palace Playacar is the only resort that I know of with 80% -85% ocean view or ocean front units. Even at the Hideaway you will not wake up in the morning and catch this exquisite sunrise. This is the only resorts that will practically guarantee this breathtaking view. And service is what sells this resort. We find that the staff here are simply not familiar (or choose not to use) the term NO. It is always CAN DO - or let me try - and they do.... we find this practice to be across the board. Is the resort perfect - no - but none of them are - yet this smaller Palace Playacar is as close as it gets - we think. From hotel check in to the meals - the smiles are always there and the master Chef (like Oscar) comes out to spend time with the guests and talk about the meal, the needs, the wants - what can they can do to \"make the vacation memorable\". Where else do you find that? This level of service is simply not available at the larger resorts - not even at other Palace locations - certainly not in this price range. The entertainment staff under the direction of Eduardo also \"know their stuff\". Demaris is just one big walking 24/7 smile and along with her buddies, Lydia, super Eric and others - they make it fun and pleasant. What Playacar Palace is not is the Cancun style \"all night party resort\" - NOP, it is just one hec of an R & R. The reception staff are also welcoming and right on with every request - from small to large. Even the maintenance manager, Alex, will ask what time is convenient to adjust what we asked for. So yes, always, and on our timetable - not his or his staff\u2019s. (It is this little stuff which goes a long way). Finally the food \u2013 or culinary success as I call it. The offerings here never disappoint. From juices galore to lux at each breakfast - to the sashimi \"made to order\" before dinner at the Asian restaurant - they are just tops. The presentation by these master chefs, the service and the caliber of the product \u2013 are high end. We keep coming back here because the restaurants know how to please. And if you are lucky you can catch Angelo the \u201ccaptain\u201d offer a beautiful Yucatan serenade (along with the routine string trio) at dinner time. It's \u201cPriceless\u201d! The only negative - and it is a negative for Mexico in general - is the up-front push for timeshare sales. My suggestion is just say no and move on - no matter what resort you are at - do not let this small negative bother you while vacationing in Mexico. In the Riviera, the resort owners do not grasp how much this timeshare pitch takes away from the overall vacation experience. Just skip it \u2013 and you will have a great time.

By day 3 of our 2 week stay the staff was calling us by name. On this trip my mom travelled with me and she totally enjoyed her time. This resort has something for everyone from young to senior. We stayed in a concierge level room, room is the same but the little perks give you a special coffee maker, aromatherapy and pillow menu. Also the toiletries are upgraded. They are still developing there concierge level but do have a section on the beach dedicated to this level with tables and umbrellas. There are 3 restaurants to chose from for your main meals. The Italian offers wonderful ala carte every evening all meals there were fantastic, be sure to try the special coffees. The oriental ala carte has a wonderful selection of fresh sushi for starters and the entres are very tasty. For the lighter fair the buffet always has a great selection of fresh fruit and veggies. The grill offers fresh cuts made to order at all meals omelletes at breakfast, burgers at lunch, meat and fish at dinner. The make your own pasta(pasta is made fresh) is a wonderful way to put a great meal together. Hostess Juanita will great you with a friendly smile and conversation. Jazz is always attentive to make sure you are getting what you need. Dion, Jesus, Isaac, Germienes, Guadalupa, and more will wait take very good care of you for a buffet this is amazing. If you dont' see something ask the chefs are fanastic and regularly come out to check on the patrons. Special thanks to Pablo in the Italian for taking such good care of us, sorry can't remember the other names but all the staff is fabulous. The pool are is smaller but definitely enough room for everyone, on busier days you may want to check earlier in the morning for those special seats want. If you need an umbrella and they are all taken just ask and the staff will do what ever they can to get you one. Perla is wonderful to take care of you. Sitting in her area is a pleasure she will take very good care of you. All the staff at the pool are equally attentive. Entertainment, for a small resort they really work hard for you. Erik and Baxter will keep you fit and entertained all day long. The whole entertainment staff work very hard and long days give them your comments and let them know if you need anything. Vacation planners will help you schedule your travel, spa, golf and more. The $1500 room bonus is a wonderful add on. Make sure you take avantage of what you can book with it. I recommend the spa for sure all the treatments are wonderful, the locker rooms are well attended with hydro therapy available before your treatments or after. Erandi was outstanding with the massages and facial. Golf is great, take enough balls if you are not a straight hitter you won't be searching in the jungle for long. Lots of animals on the course beware of traipsing through the jungle the poisonious plants are not fun to run into along with spiders,snakes, lizards etc. If you don't see it or can't reach it with a ball retriever forget it. The course is tight with lots of challenges. We also golf at the Moon Palace they offer 27 holes to play. Much different style course more open but lots of sand and water to deal with. La Quinta Avenida begins at the south end right out the lobby, check out the shopping and night entertainers on the pedestrain walk. If you want to go out for dinner there are fantastic restaurants and pubs. If you want to head over to Cozumel grab the ferry right next door it runs every hour. Note only buy a oneway ticket, there are 2 ferry lines so if you are wanting to keep your return trip open don't get sucked into the round trip. Venture around town and then stroll down to the Cozumel Palace for a little sun, food, drinks and relaxing at the pool all the amenities are available to you as a patron of the palace resort. You can snorkel right in front of the resort, there is no beach at this one. The concierge was great in hiring a taxi for us to travel around the island one they use often.

My husband and I were just coming down with a pretty bad cold just as we were arriving, so we didn't do as much as we normally would as we ended up going to bed early most nights (not like us), but as we were pampered by the staff, we surely didn't suffer. Our friends, who were not ill, had the time of their lives. They both agreed that for them, it was their best vacation ever (and they vacation a lot). They certainly made up for what we missed. They told us nighttime at Playa was a blast with lots of music and fun nightlife. Special thanks to Jose, our waiter at Terrazza. The food at Terrazza was incredible, and Jose was a wonderful waiter, and he makes a wonderful Mayan coffee. Isreal at the buffet was also wonderful, making sure our cappuchinos were always full and hot.

We are in our late 20s and were looking for an all-inclusive resort in Riviera Maya that offered great food, a nice pool and beach area, golf, spa and a relaxing environment. After much research we settled on Playacar Palace. Upon arriving we were immediately impressed with the staff, the relaxing check in process and overall luxury feel of the resort. We were anxious about only having 2 \"order off the menu\" restaurants in addition to the buffet but that never was an issue. We were there for 6 nights and 7 day and enjoyed every meal. The restaurants are loosely labeled as an Italian restaurant and a Japanese steakhouse but both offered a wide array of entr\u00e9es. The staff in the restaurants and throughout the resort were fantastic and remembered us throughout our stay. The pool area was very nice and we never had to fight for pool chairs even though the resort was full. We were served drinks all day (and lunch!) without having to leave our chairs. The beach is the white sand you would hope for and the water was crystal clear. The location of the resort is also great in that you are very close to the shopping district and the ferry to Cozumel. We had lunch and swam at the sister property on Cozumel for a day which was also very nice. The $1500 resort credit made the trip as it took an otherwise very nice vacation and made it luxurious. We were able to get almost 3 spa treatments, 3 rounds of golf, a steak and lobster dinner on the beach and an excursion swimming with the dolphins out of it. The only negative was the view from our room (basically a parking lot view). We paid for the lowest end room so we didn't expect too much and we spent very little time in the room.

This is such a great location, we were at 2 minutes walk from nice jungle park with an exotic bird sanctuary (Aviario), 1 minute walk from all the shops in Playa del carmen (and there are a lot: from Mexican goodies to luxury goods) and 1 minute walk in the sand from the ferry dock to Cozumel.

They truly made this vacation for us a special one. There are two restaurants \u00e0 la carte, Italian and Japanese both excellent to say the least. The buffet was also available early in the morning and it was absolutely top notch ! Probably the best buffet I ever had in resorts, different all throught the week. We were also lucky to benefit from the 1500$ welcome gift from the hotel for activities. You can really do a long way with this bonus. You can upgrade on wine, on your room, play 7 games of golf (and the course is nice!) , get pampered at the excellent spa, get your photo taken by professionnals, swim with the dolphins, go on excursions to ruins, you name it ! We were unable to spend it all ! The hotel is on a really nice white sandy beach, very wide, clean and not busy at all. You can walk on either side (pass the dock going north) for kilometers. I had to use the medical assistance. A very nice and professional doctor visited us in our room 20 minutes after calling for 90$ US. He gave us what we needed and we were out scuba diving an hour later! I do not have anything negative to say about this hotel other perhaps than the lobby, although very spacious, comfortable and practical may not be as impressive than some other lobbies you may have encountered.

The beach has been filled in and extended and they now have a great big beautiful beach which really made it even nicer to be at the hotel. Also, we were so surprised to find that so much of the staff was the same as before and many of them remembered us.

I would give this place more than 5 stars for service and friendlness. To give an honest opinion for other travelers, the food, although plentiful and always fresh, was not what I would consider 5 star cuisine comparitively to NY standards, but there was always something we could eat and THEY ALWAYS ACCOMODATED US BY MAKING ANYTHING WE WOULD ASK FOR!

This was our second time at the resort. We stayed there last year during the same time. We enjoyed it so much we returned. We enjoyed our stay at the Playacar Palace but it wasn't as good of a stay as it was in 2010. We noticed the service was a little slower than last year. We found out the reason was because last year Palace Resorts had only 7% occupancy because of the swine flu epidemic, while this year they were booked solid, so there were a lot more people there. The food is good, but we found after eating it for 10 days it became routine. They do try to vary the menu in the buffet restaurant but the other menues are limited. The great thing about Palace is they'll pretty much make anything you ask for as long as it's in reason. They'll even make things that aren't on the menu, like fruit smoothies and club sandwiches. I rated the location a 4 not because of its proximity to Playa del Carmen and 5th Avenue. It's only a block away. However, the resort is an hour from the airport, maybe longer if your transfer is picking up/dropping off others. We had 2 stops on the way to the resort and it took 1 1/2 hours to get there from Cancun. The rooms are nice and the resort is very clean. The staff is excellent. The Mexican people are very service oriented and they will do anything to help you. The resort is all-inclusive and tipping is not required, however, we usually left a dollar or two for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Again, this is not required or even expected, but they really, really appreciate it. The pool is nice and clean, but it is on the small side. There is a problem getting a good poolside chair with an umbrella. I woke up at 5:45 to get a seat by the pool and found many had already been \"saved\" with towels. The resort needs more umbrellas and chairs. Another issue we had was with the hotel and its policy of bringing people from the Adventura Palace, a much bigger resort. There are at least 2 busloads of people from the Aventura that come to the Playacar daily and they take up a lot of space at the pool. They come to the more expensive Playacar for the intimate atmosphere, its proximity to 5th Avenue and the ferry to Cozumel, and, most importantly, its beach. The Adventura does not have a beach, only a lagoon. We found it annoying that we paid the extra money to stay in Playacar only to have our prime seats taken by others from its sister resort. Another issue we had was a check-in. We reserved a king bed and when we got there we were told they only had a double bed. Of course my wife and I argued our case. We had even called the Palace 800 number the Wednesday before we left for the resort (Saturday the 26th) and we were told by a Palace representative that a king bed with ocean view was reservied for us and we had $2250 in resort money because we were staying 9 nights. When we got there they changed the story. We had to bargain with the hotel manager (Nelly) and we agreed to go to the timeshare presentation at Adventura and in exchange she put us in a king bed ocean view suite and gave us an extra $100 towards the spa. We only got $1,500 in resort cash because we booked prior to December 1, 2010. We had liked the resort so much that we booked our trip way back in July 2010. I asked Nelly why we were being punished for booking our trip early and she said \"because its a promotion.\" That irritated me because of what we were told on the phone and because we weren't going to use the entire $1,500 anyway, let alone $2,250. It was the whole purpose of the matter. We ended up having $500 of the $1,500 resort cash left anyway. With our resort cash we went to Chitzen Itza, did 4 treatments at the spa and also had the lobster dinner. The trip to Chitzen Itza was nice and we can say that we did it, but we won't do it again. There's a 3 1/2 trip to the ruins. On the way you stop for lunch and shopping. They give you 80 minutes and that was a big waste of time because its a buffet lunch and shopping is in one building. It didn't take more than a half an hour to eat and look at the shop. We found the tour guide hard to understand and he talked for the entire trip on a microphone in the bus and told us the history of the ruins and the Mayan people. There was a bathroom on the bus that smelled something awful. We were at the ruins for about 4 hours and he took us around and showed us everything and explained the history some more, then gave us 30 minutes to shop. Tip: don't buy anything at the first shopping stop where you eat because you can get the same thing and bargain at the ruins for a fifth of the cost. After we left we had to make several stops to drop off people at different resorts, so it was another 3 hour trip home. It was a very, very long day and we were exhausted afterwards. On a brigher note, the spa is wonderful but the women who work there do not speak English. Neither does the gentleman who takes you there from the hotel. The bus ride from the hotel to the spa is short and free and it runs every 15 minutes. The lobster dinner was good, but it rained the night of our reserved spot. You have to book early because they only have 10 reservations per night. Because it rained, we ended up eating inside at the Luna Lounge which was kinda cheesy but we made the best of it. It rained 2 of the 10 days we were there for short periods, but mainly the temp was 86 with low humidity and a nice, gentle warm breeze blowing off the ocean. The breeze at night picks up a bit but it's still very comfortable to be outside in shorts. The vendors on 5th avenue will try to get you to buy things and yell to you while you're walking down the street. We ignored many of them. We looked into buying some Cuban cigars and found one vendor to be full of B.S. I think it was called the IGAR Shop. Don't buy from them because they are selling fake Cubans. We purchased our Cuban directly from the resort. While we paid a little more we knew we were getting a real Cuban cigar. We found the trip to be extremely relaxing and we will probably go back, but maybe not next year as we'd like to try other parts of the Carribbean. I don't think we'll go for 10 days again. A week is enough as the food starts to taste the same after awhile. We made a lot of friends with the staff including Juanita the hostess and Jose and Nora who are both servers. They work 6 days a week and they work at least 12 hours a day as usually you'll see the same server for breakfast at 7 am there for dinner at 7 pm and later. They work very, very hard to please you and we've never run into a staff member who was not respectful. When you thank them they always say \"it's a pleasure.\" If you want your room cleaned earlier in the day, just call the front desk. They will clean it later in the day if you don't ask. Also, the timeshare presentation is supposed to be 90 minutes, but by the time it was all said and done, it turned into 4 hours. We were not happy about that. They try to get you to buy a membership but we found it wasn't that great a deal. There's a McDonald's a block away if you crave American food. There are also other American themed restaurants on 5th Avenue we did not try. Also, book your tranfers direct with the hotel if you can. We booked ours through Best Day and ended up going to different resorts to drop off and pick up other folks. If you book with Palace, you'll only go to other Palace resorts. Also, the trip to Cozumel is worth it. They have a lot of shopping and the Cozumel Palace is about a mile from the dock, so you can walk. The fee is $13 per person one way, so the cost round trip is $26. Don't go on a Sunday because the shops are not open as the cruise ships are not there on Sundays. You can also book many trips from the vendor on the dock cheaper than you can book them through Palace. One more thing - the rooms are nice but we found we could hear people above us. They kept moving their furniture at night and that was annoying and kept us up. Spa, golf and fitness center are off-site with free shuttle. Would recommend walking around Playa del Carmen - area seems safe around the resort.

Very clean. Although it is all inclusive, we had to call for our mini bar and fridge to be restocked instead of it being done automatically. We met a few people that bought shares of the resort back in the 80's. They are treated like royalty with huge suites overlooking the water. The wait staff seemed to know them by name. Guests were very friendly. They could tell we were newlyweds by the color of our bracelets. The staff was very hospitable and there to assist with whatever you may need. The pool games, trivia, etc were very fun and kept the hubby busy while I relaxed beside the pool. The wait staff by the pool were very friendly. This is a smaller resort, so it feels more like a hotel. They do have entertainment nightly. The fire show was amazing. Micheal Jackson impersonator was funny. The inclusive trips offered by the resort were minimal. We went golfing down the street at the other palace resort and had a blast. There was no one else around. Just the birds. We also went on a trip to see Tulum which was packaged with going to visit another palace resort. I would not waste my time on this again. Tulum is beautiful, but you'd be better off venturing there on your own. Beware the guy with the iguana - he'll hand it to you, ask you for your camera, and then tell you he'll take a pic for $10...with your camera... The other half of that tour at the palace resort was like going to a ghost town. There was no one in the buffet restaurant, no one at the pools, no one walking around. The buffet food at that resort was horrible. We feel we wasted a day. There are only a few restaurants offered at Playacar Palace. By the 3rd day of our 6 day stay, I was sick of the food. The Italian restaurant had a limited menu and we went there twice. The first night, the food was great. The second time, they burnt my husband's filet mignon and he did not receive another meal until my dessert was served. The Asian restaurant was pretty good, but how many times in a week do you want to eat that? We tried the sushi and a few other dishes. The pizza at the pool bar saved me a few times when I was sick of the same old buffet food that didn't taste quite right. The burgers and fries tasted frozen and fishy. We both ended up with the traveler's sickness and we only ate at the resort. If you are a beer drinker, this resort is not for you. Dos Equis is the only beer offered. All of the frozen drinks started to taste the same to me. I'm assuming it was the ice. Margaritas didn't even taste like a margarita. Stuff was just off. We did do the romantic dinner on the beach. Besides having to use the flash on my camera to see what I was eating, that meal wasn't half bad. Lobster, steak, salad, soup, dessert, champagne...Nice way to end the trip. Our friends had recommended this resort to us for our honeymoon and I wish we went somewhere else. When your stomach is upset and the food is bad, it makes it hard to forget the negatives.

Right next to the ferry to Cozumel and within a block of lots of great shopping along 5th Avenue. Nice beach with beautiful views of the blue, blue ocean from nearly every room. Room was most comfortable with all marble floors, jacuzzi, and bathroom, and really comfy beds. We were supposed to get a king bed but when we arrived they had us on the ground floor. We wished a higher floor so we settled for 2 double beds on the 4th floor. Turned out to be a good move. Very quiet also. Sometimes the room didn't get cleaned until later in the day but that wasn't too bad. Food was about what you would expect at a resort, pretty decent, but the Italian dining room was extremely noisy. You could barely hear your dining partner across the table. They really need to do something about the acoustics in there. Pool area could have been a little larger too. Sometimes it was hard to find lounge chairs unless you got up at 7:00 AM and put towels and some personal stuff on a couple to save them like everybody else did. Usually only about a fourth of the chairs were actually occupied by a person at any given time, just towels, books, sandals, etc. piled on them. Don't know how that situation could be remedied but they need to work on it. Also a restroom on the pool level near the bar would be most welcome instead of having to negotiate cement steps in flip flops down to a rather grungy basement area, or making a trip back inside the hotel. We used the $1500 resort dollars they gave us on a trip to the ruins at Tulum which was very interesting. Wish we could have spent more time there instead of the bus leaving to stop at a little roadside handicraft market and at Xpu Ha, one of their sister resorts. It felt like they were just trying to promote their company instead of giving a quality tour of the beautiful Mayan ruins. We also used resort $$ swimming with dolphins which was fun, a steak and lobster romantic candlelight dinner on the beach which was nice, and the rest of the $$ went toward a photo package. We brought home 20 5X7\" prints of us in various settings around the resort as well as a disk containing more pictures. They turned out pretty good considering what they had to work with --we are in our 60's and have probably looked better in the past. ;-) The waiters were very professional and friendly as were all the employees that we dealt with. We looked forward to Dionicio at the breakfast buffet every morning and there were so many more whose names I can't recall, but they were all wonderful. One of the main reasons we chose this resort was that we could call back to the states for free from the phone in our room, and you never have to make a reservation for dining in any of the 3 restaurants. We just showed up when we were ready to eat and we were always seated in less than 5 minutes. (Our daughter just got back from Jamaica and she reported having to stand in a long line to make reservations 3 days in advance, and then you had to pick between 6:30 and 9:00. That would be a real pain.) Palace Resorts really have a great system with how they do their dining. All in all, it was a good place to unwind for a week. I wanted to go parasailing but it was too windy most of the time. Each day was mostly sunny and between 80 and 85, but the wind was probably the biggest drawback. (We found that much nicer a year ago at the Vallarta Palace on the west coast where it was not so windy.) If I were doing it all over I would stay a couple more days so there would be time for a trip to Cozumel and a little more lazing by the pool.

The food was good and despite having only three restaurants, there was good variety. A big plus was the outstanding and friendly service provided by the waitresses, pool staff, bell hops, and maids. However, on the negative side, the hotel does not provide any on-site access to a fitness center or spa. They do have a shuttle service to an off-site spa, but this is not very convenient. Although the beach is one of the best along this stretch of the Mayan Riviera, other than an occasional beach volleyball game, no beach activities are offered through the hotel. That said, one can easily find activities such as parasailing, personal watercraft rental, etc. at private vendors along the beach within a short distance. Most disapppointing, the pool is only so-so (shallow and small) and the hotel has a very limited amount of umbrellas available. These are at such a premimum that regulars \"reserve\" their spots by 5:30 to 6:00 AM every morning - so no sleeping-in on this vacation if you want an umbrella for shade by the pool. There were no umbrellas or cabanas provided on the beach for anyone other than VIP members. If you like pool-side activities, this hotel might be a good choice. The pool staff were constantly offering water aerobics, water volleyball, stretching, trivia guessing games, etc. each and every day. However, if you would like some quiet time along the beach or by the pool, the music and activities at the Playacar Palace are non-stop and loud. Also beware, the Playacar Palace management/guest services staff are frequently pulling \"bait and switch\" offers. When we initially reserved a room, paying the full amount in advance to get a good rate, we were told we would be staying in one of the few Governor's Suites that looked directly out to the ocean and consisted of two rooms. This was confirmed directly by calling the hotel and its location specifically described. However, when we arrived, we had been downgraded to a lesser Governor's Suite - it was a nice room, but over looked the pool with a distant view of the beach and ocean and had a smaller sitting area not really separate from the bedroom. We were offered a promotion (being offered to essentially everyone) of $1500 in hotel credits. However, when we attempted to use $350 of these for a \"romatic\" lobster dinner on the beach\", it turned out, they had over-booked that evening and we were relegated to the buffet restaurant with a table overlooking the pool area. Guest services clearly was aware of this at the time they made the reservation, but failed to tell us. While sitting in the lounge, we also heard this and similar scams being pulled on other guests. Needless to say, after seeing where we would be sitting for the \"romantic dinner\", we refused and went to one of the other restaurants. Related to the difficulties with the management and guest services, we had attempted to book some activities and spa services in advance of our stay and although they theoretically offered a way to do so via their web site, this service never worked. The site would allow you to view the services, select a service and time, but then when we tried to actually book the service/activity, we repeatedly received an error statement indicating a problem with the server. Bottom-line, if you want a smaller resort with limited on-site dining, limited activities and also want to spend most of your time by a loud and boisterous pool area with access to the beach, or do not mind the complete absence of any shade by the pool or beach, the Playacar might be a good choice.

We had booked rooms with partial sea view but when we arrived we had a full sea view right on the beach. It was wonderful watching the world go by.

The staff are very attentive, especially at breakfast, and they always have a smile and are willing to do anything for you. Lovely people. Breakfast was the usual buffet but very good quality. Lunches too in the main restaurant were excellent. Evening meals did get a little boring after a couple of weeks of a choice of only 3 restaurants, but like all other reviewers we found the Italian restaurant the best, although the quality fluctuated from being outstanding to average. The lamb chops and steak are by far the best thing on the menu. The Oriental restaurant is not that good. With regard to the main restaurant, it's necessary to eat there early on (around 7pm) to get the best. We tended to go there after 8pm when everything had been sitting around for a couple of hours going cold. The bar service was good, but that was no surprise as there was never anyone in there! The quality of drinks leave something to be desired. They certainly do NOT serve top shelf spirits etc. Gin and tonic tasted more like water and the beer is very weak tasting The best drinks were cocktails or brandy/coke. Wine with the meal was acceptable. We always plumped for the Chilean red which was really pretty good. This hotel is on a lovely beach, but if you want lots of water sports, forget it. There are jet skis on the beach to hire and you can parasail but that's about it. There are other hotels in the group which offer snorkelling and kayaking but not here, but these hotels don't have such a lovely beach. The hotel is literally a stone's throw from 5th Avenue shopping area with bars, restaurants and tourist paraphernalia on sale, so if you like to walk out at night and see some life, it is very close by, whereas the other hotels are quite isolated. The golf course is a 5 minute shuttle away and it is the most difficult course we have ever played.

We stayed again this year January 4-13. We had more than a fabulous stay this time. A lot of the staff remembered us and it was like having a family reunion; hugs from everyone and we were all so happy to see each other again. We had intended this trip to enjoy some tours and perhaps visit Cozumel Palace and Moon Palace. However, we were enjoying the sun and relaxation so much we were only able to tear ourselves away for one day at Adventura Spa for pampering and dinner. It is also a beautiful resort and for anyone looking for the week of pampering this would be the place. The only drawback is the lack of outdoor heated pool and beach. However, there is a 20 minute shuttle between the resorts so it\u2019s not difficult to include a beach day at Playacar. There are a number of things and numerous people who made this trip special to us. First and foremost, my husband and I spent nine days of quality time together. We laughed, we danced, we ate, we drank tequila and cognac, we basked in the sun, and we swam in the ocean. Nothing could have been better with perfect weather. We also had the pleasure of meeting several people who made our trip memorable like Cynthia and Keith from Ottawa. Not only did we enjoy two Italian dinners together and each other\u2019s company around the pool but we danced together at the Luna Lounge. Peter and I love to dance and although Playacar does not have an official disco the Luna Lounge became ours. Peter also loves music and has an incredible collection of all types including the latest dance music and we always travel with his iPod and portable speakers. So after dinner we would head to the Luna, set up our music and dance. It was a pleasure that so many other guests joined us. We also met a remarkable family from Chile. It did take a few nights to get them dancing but when they finally did we had a wonderful time together. From Ohio we met Joan and Scott at the pool and had a fun day sipping \u201cmilkshakes\u201d. We would like to recognize the following staff members. Juanita, whose warm, beautiful smile greeted us every morning for breakfast. Jazz who brought my special carrot juice, remembering every morning and always asking if there was something special I wanted. Sebastian, our waiter in the Mexican restaurant, who on our first evening, brought small plates of tasty Mexican morsels to our table. It was a pleasure. Santos, warm, wonderful Santos, who brought us special mimosas at breakfast. Guatelope, our waiter in the Italian Restaurant, who amazed us by remembering us from two years ago at Palace Vallarta. Fanny, Perla and Juana for their lovely smiles and poolside service. The bartenders, Gaspar (always happy) and Manuel (always smiling). Our special recognition to Carlo Moises Vicas Canche who served us every evening in the Luna Lounge. Our special thanks to Carlo Palma and Alfredo for arranging the Disco night at the Luna.

This was our second week in Mexico - just the 2 of us. We were there on an RCI PP-AI exchange which did not include the $1500 Palace credit, but the price was greatly reduced and we did all the tours in February 2010 when we stayed at the Sun Palace. We were offered the $1500 promotion if we would go on a Sales presentation, but we don't like to waste vacation days doing the timeshare sales thing. We hear they are especially bad in Mexico although several people that we met said they were not bad at the Palace. We were given room 236 on the south side of the pool, just above the pool bar. The only complaint about the room is it seems the 2 person hot tubs were added \"later\" and it was difficult to negotiate out the balcony sliding door - it was a squeeze. Other than that, the room was perfect. The shower was great - strong pressure & hot. The maid service was excellent. The food was what you would expect at any Palace resort. Buffet for breakfast and lunch adding in the Italian & Asian restaurants at night. All were good with the exception of beef. I've never had a good cut of beef in Mexico and this was no exception. Didn't bother me as I usually go for the fish anyways. The service at this Palace resort was very good everywhere you went - restaurants, bars, pool. We always tipped our servers as the service was very good - even though it was not necessary. The location of this resort was great. Walk through a courtyard (guarded) and you are on the ferry dock to Cozumel and 5th Avenue. My husband hates the 5th avenue type of thing, but I love it (the haggling - Lady, just a dollar!) especially the people watching. We found a massage place just east of 5th on Calle 4 on the north side of the road with Massages 2/$40/1hr - and they were good massages. We went 3 times. We took one day over to Cozumel. Just off the Playa Pier, we bought a snorkling package for $30 each and then took the ferry over. We were picked up on the ferry pier for our trip and when we were done, we were dropped off at the Cozumel Palace dock and spent the rest of the day there by the pool and for lunch. Cozumel Palace is about 4-5 blocks from the shopping area of Cozumel and about 10 blocks from the Ferry Pier, so we spent a little bit of time in the square before we caught our ferry back. We spent one day over at Aventura Spa Palace. This is a beautiful resort and we have already decided to spend our 30th Anniversary in December there. You cant beat the $1500 Spa promotion Palace has going on now. The pools were wonderful there but there was no beautiful beach like at the Playacar. Just a note about exchanging money: We exchanged money several times downtown and the going rate was 11.70 where the straight exchange was 12.34. Although the resort had signs that the exchange rate was 11.00, when I did exchange, it was 12.00. Easier and safer to exchange at the hotel, so try this before you go to a public booth on 5th avenue. Also, ALWAYS confirm the cost of the cab ride BEFORE you get in the cab. Hotel posted 440 Pesos to the airport which would be just under $36, but the cab driver charged us $45 at the airport.

We really felt the staff were exceptional - friendly and outgoing providing very attentive service and managed to do so without being intrusive. The location in Playacar is great! The security of a gated commumity while only two blocks from the tourist area of Playa del Carman and a short stroll down the beach to the Cozumel ferry. One concern I had looking at the hotel website and satelite views of the resort was that it looked like there was no beach - the photos are old and should be updated as the beach is 300 feet wide of white powdery sand that is kept immaculately clean. The pool and beach front patio are large for the size of the resort which, at around 200 rooms, is more like a boutique hotel. This is an all-inclusive with breakfast and lunch buffet and 2 a la cartes (Italian and Asian) and Mexican-International buffet for dinner. Breakfast and lunch buffets were consistently very good, well prepared with a changing variety daily, we don't care for dinner buffets so never attended. My wife prefered the Asian and I the Italian, both had a good variety on the menus and well prepared meals with the Asain a more casual atmosphere and the Italian more upscale (gracias Guadalope for the magnifico service!). We did use room service (24 hr included) a few times for breakfast/snacks and one dinner, it was quick and food was again well prepared. And, of course, what makes the the vacation is the attentive pool-side and beach service available throughout the day (gracias Perla, Martha and all the rest). The hotel has a good recreation and entertainment program with daily activities around the pool, a kids program, and evening entertainment that was of a much higher calibre than I had expected from such a small resort (don't miss the Fire Show or the Michael Jackson review. The resort tended to be very quiet once the entertainment was finished (usually by 21:30) but that's to be expected with the close proximity to PDC's night life. The other thing I enjoyed about our stay, likely the hotels marketing staff deserves credit for this, but the guests were very international - many Europeans, South Americas, Aussies, as well as the expected Mexican/Canadian/American clientel. Overall, if you're planning a trip to PDC we highly recommend the Playacar Palace, and there is the added bonus right now of the $1500 USD resort credit which we used for a room upgrade, couples spa package, and a Tulum tour.

My fiance had been to Cancun a few times but had not been to an all inclusive resort and had a negative idea of what it would be like (he pictured cheap buffets and a Party college crowd). We stayed at the Playacar Palace for 4 nights between Xmas and NYE and I have to say that although it was smaller than the other two all inclusives I visited earlier, the place was great. It's also right next to the center of Playa del Carmen, which makes it very convenient in case you need to purchase something outside the resort or if you feel like exploring and visiting restaurants and bars. The food was incredible!, a great selection of healthy and not so healthy options with an impecable presentation, everything was fresh and delicious. The resort is clean and the best part, THE SERVICE IS WONDERFUL!. It is so nice to see smiley faces and people eager to help you and make you happy. The italian restaurant was very good, but I would recomend to stick with non pasta dishes. The fish and steak are fantastic and salads and dessert are perfect. The Asian restaurant was also good specially the main courses. The only thing that we didn't enjoy much, was the lack of a good wine selection, they do have a list of wines that you can purchase, but the prices are very high, so we ended up going to a grocery store and buying our own wine (if you are a wine enthusiast, bring your own wine, since the whole area doesn't have much to offer). The drinks were surprisingly good and not watered down. There are two people that we need to recognize for their outstanding customer service, Guadalupe ( He's a waiter) and Perla (a waitress) out of a big helpful staff, these two employees are the greatest! :) . The other thing I need to add, is that you also have access to the other Palace resorts, so we visited the Aventura Spa Palace, which is adult only and the biggest in Latin America, for a more quiet and relaxing day, without kids. Playacar palace has only one pool but a great beach area to make up for it.

I did alot of research on trip advisor to find the perfect hotel for our honeymoon, and I chose Playacar Palace for the location, size, beach, and all the good reviews it had. My husband and I had a lovely time here. Our first room we had upon arrival was garden view and the only view we had was of a tree. The resort was offering $1500 credit and we ended up using the whole $1500 to upgrade to an ocean view suite. I was looking forward to using some of the credit towards the spa but it was our honeymoon and we wanted to wake up every day to the beautfiul ocean and beach. We ended up getting upgraded to the first floor governer's suite...which was absolutely gorgeous. The room was fabulous, and the view was phenominal. We had two patios looking straight at the beach (100 ft away), and was so nice just to come back to our room when the sun would get to be too much and sit in the shade on our patio and enjoy the lovely view. I must admit though that we paid $3650 canadian for our trip here, and I think that it was way overpriced to be getting a garden view. If I'm gonna spend $4000 I would expect to have an ocean view. Luckily the money to upgrade did not come out of our pocket. The food was excellent, and we ate all our meals in the buffet. The waiters in the buffett were so nice and we always had a good time chatting with them, and them offering us tequila every meal. We did eat one dinner in the Italian restaurant. We both ordered prime rib..and although it was tasty, it was so small in portions, and we ended up going to the buffet after to fill up our tummies. And if you order room service, they offer lots of choices, and they are so speedy. We never waited more than 15 minutes for room service. Tips are included but we tipped all the time. We tipped $1 for breakfast and lunch for our waiter and also $2 for our dinner waiter. We would tip $2 everyday for our housekeeper, and she always made sure our room was extra clean with extra special pillow art. We also would tip $3-$5 a day on our waitresses for the pool and the bar tender. Carlos the pool bartender is the best and we spent a couple evenings hanging with him, and he made lots and lots of colorful tropical shooters for us. The location was great being steps away from 5th avenue. But after spending a little bit of time walking down 5th avenue, it did not take us long to turn back to our resort. The shop owners are so annoying asking up to buy something or come into thier shop...also we got offered to buy marijuana and coccaine 5 times during our 30 minute stroll down 5th avenue. The beach is amazing. The sand is so nice, and its a mile long. The beach was never crowded and we could always get a lounge chair. We were quite shocked to find no shade on the beach. There are only 2 little umbrella huts and they are reserved for VIP. Well the whole week we were there, we never saw anybody use the umbrellas and so they are just a waste for VIP. There are plenty of umbrella's around the pool, so if we really needed to get some shade we would go to the pool. But the point of going to the Carribean is to sit on the beach and go in the crystal clear torquise water. We can sit by a pool anytime at home. So we were dissapointed in the resort for that aspect. Overall we had a great holiday and I cant find too much wrong with this hotel. The resort is so clean, and eveyone is so friendly. If you go here, you will not be dissapointed. Will we return to Playacar Palace again???? We are not sure.

Our wedding planning was extremely accomodating. We were on a tight budget and she totally worked with us in everyway possible to make the wedding a dream come true for the bride and groom. The accomodations were very nice, clean and well kept. I highly reccomend upgrading to a ocean view if possible. We did not do it because we wanted to be near some of our group but the view would have been nice to wake up too. The refrigerator was always stocked and room service was great. The turn down service was very nice as well. The location was awesome! This was my 6th visit to the area and was overall my very favorite hotel. I would definatly stay there again. The room credit they were offering during our stay was a bonus for everyone. It allowed our group to do tours that they otherwise might not have done. The tours were easy to book and I think everyone got to do what they wanted to do. My neices and nephews got to swim with the dolphins basically for free. They loved it and I'm certain it is something they will never forget. My only suggestion would be if you want to schedule the \"romantice dinner\" on the beach, schedule it your first day. It was booked by the time I tried to do it. (this was my fault as I was busy with the wedding). The pool and beach were awesome and there were always activities available.

The wait staff was uber-friendly, always smiling and acted as if working at the resort was the best place to work at in all of Mexico! It almost made me quit my job back in the States to work at the resort. They were all so much fun to be around and they certainly got a kick out of our wedding group. Every 15 minutes they were bringing us shots of tequila. And they had great memory - always remembering what each of us drank. The rooms were cleaned twice daily with turn down service every night. Room service is 24/7 (that really helped during late nights of drinking when we got food cravings!). Check in was flawless and after half a day of traveling, the champagne and cold towel were a welcome perk!

On our last night there we took the ferry (located right beside the hotel) over to Cozumel Palace to have dinner. Other guests from the wedding also went over to Cozumel Palace where they used their facilities and were given a guest room to change in. Senor Frogs is also located beside the hotel. FUN place! Cheap drinks! Great place to dance as well. The privacy of the resort was another plus. Unless you were wearing one of those wristbands you were not allowed in the resort. Security was on top of things! On numerous occassions I saw them stop people walking along the beach who tried to get into the resort. The greatest thing about the resort? The resort credits.

Our 88 year old mother traveled with us and she was trated like a queen..but then again..we all were treated like kings & queens. I can't wait to go back and I look forward to seeing the staff again.

Words can not express how happy I was with the Playacar Palace. Like other reviews have complimented, I chose this hotel for the location, size & the service. First, the location is great! On a beautiful beach, steps to the ferry to Cozumel and right next to 5th Avenue for shopping or just people watching. Second, it is a smaller resort but didn't lack for anything. Being with my children, I wanted a smaller resort where we would not get lost, would not have to walk a mile in the heat to get to the beach/pool and would be able to walk off the resort at night. Lastly, the service exceeded every expectation in every aspect. These people are absolutely the best. I read all the raving reviews about the service and still was impressed. Fanny & Juanita at the pool and Elisio at the Italian restaurant were our favorites but everyone was so helpful, accomodating and above all proactive! The rooms are clean & beautiful. The maid service is great. They stock your fridge every day with soda, beer, water. They left us towel art one day that my daughter was so excited about! I felt totally safe and every need we had was met. The $1500 promotion is real, easy to use and a great benefit! And the food is very good - especially the Italian restaurant! We never visited the Asian restaurant. I have never been to an all inclusive resort and really enjoyed this option. So much easier - especially with kids who constantly want snacks & drinks! The entertainment at the pool during the day & shows available every night were fabulous. Eric & Gabriel work very hard to make sure you are having a good time and my kids absolutely adored them. We played water polo, pool volley ball, beach volleyball, trivia games, etc. I was a little worried about my kids being bored as it is a smaller resort but thanks to Eric & Gabriel, this was not the case. The kids had a great time whether out and about or just hanging at the pool all day. Free wifi in the room and free calls to the US was such a bonus and much used. 24 hour room service was also a bonus. The beds are comfortable, the jacuzzi is large and the view of the ocean was gorgeous even with our resort view room. I think all of the rooms face the ocean. For our $1500 credit, we went on the Tulum tour, swam with the dolphins, went to Isla Mujeres and went to Extreme Kingdom for ziplining. Tulum was very hot but unique to see. Our guide, Edgar, was very informative & funny. Bring lots of water, hats, sunscreen. We didn't need bug spray. The beach there is beautiful but the ocean is kind of rough. Wear your bathing suit because you will be able to go in the ocean after the tour and believe me, you will be hot! If you do the swim with the dolphins, I would ask them to book it at Wet N Wild in Cancun. We did it at the Dolphinius (sp?) in Aventura and would like to have had something to do after, like hang out at Wet n Wild where the food & drinks are included. At Dolphinius in Aventura, there is nothing else there but the dolphin swim. And you have to take a taxi. We left the hotel at 9am and were back by 11am. Also, the pictures at the dolphin swim are ridiculous. $100 for 8 pictures on a CD or $29 for a print. There is a bit of pressure to buy them and they will try to haggle with you. We didn't buy any as they really wouldn't come down on the price. The ferry ride to Isla Mujeres was pretty and a lot of fun. The guys on the boat were very entertaining. That was the best part of that tour. It is an all day event and unless you want to spend extra money on excursions on the island, there really isn't much to do on this tour but hang out at the pool there and go shopping. We paid $140 for the 4 of us to go snorkeling, which was pretty cool with lots of fish. Extreme Kingdom was fun but not ziplining is not allowed if you are under 80 pounds. My daughter & I did the horseriding, which is extra money. It was a fun half day excursion though and they will give you a ton of pictures on a CD for $25! Such a nice change from the dolphin swim! Also, I was able to squeeze in a sensational hot stone massage and facial (thank you Bernice!) with the credit. The spa facilities are top notch - I visited Aventura Palace for this instead of Playacar's spa as I wanted to do it on a Sunday and Aventura Palace had more staff on Sunday. We also went to see Aventura Palace and Xpu Ha Palace - liked Playacar Palace way better! This was a great vacation - mostly thanks to the staff at the resort but the Riviera Maya is a great place to vacation.

The hotel showcases a beautiful contemporary style, the rooms are gorgeous and clean, and the view is breathtaking. However, the service is definitly the most memorable part of the trip. The hotel is over-staffed so there is always someone to assist you. I was amazed at how the staff ALL spoke exceptional English, made an attempt to know you by name, and treated everyone courteously. The best part of the experience was watching how PROACTIVE they were in serving the guests. For example, they always seemed to be right there when your glass was down to the last sip. I even watched several of the staff bring an oversized umbrella and place it over my grandmother when they saw a storm cloud in the distance... just so she didn't have to move if it started to sprinkle! In addition to the awesome staff, we really enjoyed several things about the hotel that we don't think we would have experienced elsewhere: the pool bar was awesome, the rooms have amazing jacuzzi tubs, the hotel spa was AMAZING, and the location of the hotel made visiting 5th Avenue a breeze.

We have stayed at the Sun and Aventura resorts so we decided to try something different, something smaller but close to town. We also wanted to see how the Family Resorts worked so in the future we have an idea as to what it will be like bringing our children. The Kids Club seemed great for children and they have there own room for arts and crafts, games, toys and movies. The staff were really inot making things fun for this children and were quite involved in playing games with them. This really helped us out in seeing first hand how this would be a great Family vacation destination. The Playacar has a great location with a beautiful beach, as well as how close it is from down town. Because of this we had alot more to do than just hang out on the resort property. If we wanted to go out in the evening and do some shopping it was a few minute walk to the stores. If we wanted to go over to Cozumel it was a 1/2 hour or so boat trip and you were there. You could even avoid the whole down town area and take a 5-10 minute stroll down the beach and get your boat tickets. The food was excellent and similar to what other Palace Resorts offer. The staff is very helpful and willing to answer any questions. I think the only draw back here is the spa is off site and you have to catch a schuttle to go to and from that runs every 15 minutes or so. In the past we would usually stay at the Aventura Spa Palace and take a taxi into Playa two to three times for something to do as well as visit Playacar for dinner. I am a huge fan of the Palace Resorts and in no way did the Playacar let me down. We love the staff and how helpful and friendly they are. There is nothing like telling someone,\"thank-you\" and they reply,\"It's my pleasure\". A side note: At the time we were there they were offering $1,500.00 in Palace money to use towards golf, spa treatments, upgraded wine list, room upgrades, excursions and a romantic dinner for two on the beach. This amount was offered for staying 5 or more nights. If you spent less than 5 nights I believe that they gave you $750.00. The monies were divided up as to how much could be used in certain areas and added up to $1,500.00. I.E. you could not use the whole $1,500.00 towards your golf or spa treatments.

First time at this resort and yes...It is very quaint and nice. I traveled with my wife. Here are some key points you may just want to consider: - 3 restaurants (Jap, mex and italian). If you like sushi, you will love the jap. restaurant. - Many nights the mexican restaurant has a 3 person Mariachi band....my favorite. (tip them and they will play by your table). - 4 bars...2 inside and 2 outside... (Manuel is a bartender @ the outside bar and he was a great guy.) Get to know him if you are going..... - You will receive $1500 for spending money (an incentive they are offering) where you can spend in on dolphin swimming, tulum, the spa (only $300 can be spent at the bar), a lobster dinner on the beach, day trips, room upgrades, wine upgrades, etc. - We got a room upgrade to concierge level, swam with the dolphins, went to the spa, tulum etc. If your room sucks, I would highly suggest the room upgrade....And I found it is all how you approach it....If you go up to them screaming...well..I think it is common sense. - I thought the food was fine, tons of choices....With the room upgrade to the concierge level you receive very fast room service...like 15 minutes.....bottles of wine etc....Loved it. - So, I had no problems with this place and I am a member of palace resorts (I bought a timeshare years ago). They will try to get you to go to the \"2 hour presentation\" over at Adventura Spa Palace....I would ONLY go if you are interested in buying a time share AND I would really haggle with them on what they will give you to go (incentives). We met a couple that got a free jeep rental in Cozumel, free massages and $200 in addition to the $1500 all for going. - The staff get bonuses if they get you to sign up to go to the presentation. In my opinion...It is not worth it (unless you want a timeshare). - Ohh one last thing......With that $1500 that they give you for trips.....If you sign up for a trip and decide to pull out at the last minute...You LOSE the money....You have to give them 24 hours notice. I would book your trips ASAP with them as they fill up fast. - Lastly...We met close friends down there that stayed a week a the Cozumel Palace prior to coming to the playacar.....They said the Cozumel Palace was nicer....Just an FYI. -My email is upstateny27@yahoo.com if you would like to ask me any questions regarding palace resorts or the playacar...I would be happy to assist you.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tempe, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cAwesome week in paradise\u201d", "Author": "Laura31377", "ReviewID": "UR71290794", "Content": "Great food, GREAT service, beautiful beach, wonderful rooms, awsome town!", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Service!!\u201d", "Author": "udontknowjack", "ReviewID": "UR71115852", "Content": "Our group of 8 adult and 2 child travelers spent the week of July 7th to 14th at the resort and loved every minute of it!

It wasn't the best food but it wasn't terriable either. The buffet was good not great as well, but its buffet. Shops were right next to the hotel, great for exploring didn't have to walk far at all to either get on the ferry to cozumel or to walk around 5th ave. Great location. The only down side was once you arrive they try to sell you an excursion right away but hey they at least make sure your comfortable before they start selling you something. Also, if you want to party like in Cancun this isn't the location, its more of laid back enviorment and relaxing. Overall, this is was an amazing exprience.

We had a great time and loved the hotel. I booked this trip back in Feb 2010 before they changed the new promotion to the current $1500 promo where you can use th$1500 towards room upgrades, spa, excursions, wine, or romantic dinner. Since we had already planned our day trips we decided to go with a room upgrade. We were given a suite, room 100. It was at the end of the resort and it was a beautiful room. Two double beds. Couch. Sitting area with two chairs. Desk area. walk in closet. Patio area with 2 lounge chairs and table that look out to the beach. We ate in Playa Del Carmen 2 evenings to experience some local cuisine. The other nights we ate mainly at the buffet restaurant because we were tired from the day's activities. But one night we did eat at the Italian restuarant and it was excellent. We didnt try the Asian rest. mainly because I am not a big fan on Asian food. The buffet was good. But i agree with others, if you eat here, order something to be cooked fresh. They have a variety of items that they will prepare for you on the grill. We ate at the buffet restaurants at Cozumel Palace, Aventura Cove, and Xpu Ha palace but we like the one at the Playacar Palace the best. If you wanted a snack in the afternoon you could order from the pool bar. we liked the chips and guacamole. Very good! The nightly shows were very entertaining. We saw the fire show, circus show, and Brazilian dance show. We enjoyed the fire show the best. It was excellent. It was much better than the fire show we went to off property in Playa Del Carmen at the Fusion Beach Club one evening. We didnt catch the Michael Jackson show though because we arent fans of his music so i cant comment on how that show was. Service was great! poolside service was awesome. The staff were all friendly. Super Erik was great at leading pool side activities and emcee'ing the nightly events. The hotel was not crowded so we never experienced any issues with finding a lounge chair by the pool. We didnt see any of the \"towel games\" we had heard about at other resorts. We took one tour the hotel offered. The Tulum/Xpu-Ha tour. The guide, Ernest was awesome. I was saddened by our stop to Xpu-Ha palace. we had stayed there 6 years ago before the hurricane damaged it. It is still a nice place but not the same as before. the tour was great, though. Love Tulum. So beautiful. The only thing I wish the hotel did was offer more frequent shuttles to the other Palace resorts in the area. Minor complaint Great hotel. We would definitely stay here again. Convenient location to 5th Ave and ferry pier to Cozumel and we liked that it is a smaller resort and more intimate. It definitely fits our style of vacation.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing, great value honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "briteangl8", "ReviewID": "UR66739372", "Content": "We spent our honeymoon (6 days) at Playacar Palace. We'd booked the hotel a while back and I got nervous when reviews started going down hill, but we found it to be an excellent vacation that we'd highly recommend to others. Keep in mind I've never been to an all-inclusive resort before so I don't have much to compare to. Room: Our room (honeymoon suite 243) was great! It was on the far side of the hotel so we had an amazing view of the beach without any pool noise. The patio was HUGE and I liked that there was both a table and lounge chairs out there. The suite had a bedroom and a living area with minibars and TVs in each room. The living room was small and a bit crowded, but it was fine for our needs as we didnt' spend much time there. The spa tub in the bedroom was spacious and overlooked the beach/patio. The bathroom was also roomy. Our only complaint about the room was that there was actually NO DOOR on the bathroom at all! I know its a honeymoon suite and we're married now, but some things should remain private. Food: The food on the resort was decent. I was always able to find something I liked. Of the three restaurants, we thought the Italian spot was BY FAR the best and we had two seriously excellent dinners there. They also did a romantic honeymooners dinner for us, which was nice. Stop by the \"public relations\" desk to set that up. The Asian restaurant was ok. We enjoyed the entrees but weren't big fans of the sushi. At the buffet, breakfast was our favorite meal. I couldn't get enough! Lunch and dinner were always suitable, but nothing special. We also took advantage of the limited menu of snacks served by the pool. The burgers were really good and we ate tons of guacamole. We did feel that the alcoholic drinks on the resort were possibly somewhat watered down. Amenities/Atmosphere: When we went to the resort it was pretty quiet. It was always busy by the pool (though we had no trouble getting a good spot both in the sun and the shade), however, at night this place was really empty. At the restaurants we were often only one of 4 or so tables dining. The nightly entertainment drew a slightly larger crowd, but the bar areas were always very quiet at night. We were disappointed in this because we wanted to take full advantage of our all inclusive deal, rather than going off-site to find entertainment in the evenings. Otherwise, we really enjoyed the facilities. The decor was nice and comfortable. The pool area and swim-up bar were great and the beach was large, accessible and not to crowded. We didn't shuttle over to use the spa/golf club during our stay. I do think it would have been fun if there were more water sports or activities at the resort. Service: Great, the whole time, hands down. We had no problems with the service, everyone was really friendly and responsive and knew our names and drink orders by the end of our trip. Other: We did an included excursion to Tulum. It took a while because of pick-ups at other resorts but our tour guide was great and we think it was worth it being that it was included. During this tour we also stopped at another palace resort, Xpu-Ha, for a few hours. We didn't think it was that nice and we didn't like the restaurant there, so while it was ok to hang out at the pool we were glad we didn't stay there. We also took the ferry to Cozumel and visited Cozumel Palace. We liked the pool there and took advantage of the free snorkeling, which was fun. The location of Palace is great because its very close to Fifth Avenue and the ferry. I got the impression that a lot of the other Playacar resorts would be too far to walk into town, which we did a few times for dinner and drinks and also to catch the ferry. We had a fantastic time at Playacar Palace and we'd recommend it to others, especially for the value as it was a pretty low-cost honeymoon, overall!", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Novi, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWill be back!!! Perfect spot for me and my wife!\u201d", "Author": "peeps122002", "ReviewID": "UR66656389", "Content": "Okay, there are a few things I would caution you about and a few things that you have to take advantage of. First, lets start with the negative.. do not stop by the \"concierge\" desk. Really they aren't a concierge; they are sales people trying to mark up prices to go to different theme parks, etc. Also, make sure you print off the details of your stay so that you will get your free tours. No one told us about it when we arrived, and I remembered seeing something in my reservation saying \"free tours\". The staff acted like they weren't sure what they were. I have a feeling these come with most of the reservations. I would highly suggest the Tulum tour (but take bug spray). The tour guide was outstanding! He was Mayan and still lived in the jungle... he gave a lot of insight into the culture and the way they currently live. It was one of the highlights of the stay. Now the service was very good. Towards the end of the trip, I remember getting upset because we had a few people that weren't overly friendly. That's when it hit me... the service had been so fantastic that when the people weren't incredibly friendly, I was disappointed. How silly! The people were great and they quickly spoiled me. The rooms were very nice. They asked us if we wanted to upgrade to an ocean view, and we declined. We got to our room, and we had a tremendous, full view of the Caribbean we just couldn't see the pool. The view was great! I actually loved the rooms and liked the jucuzzi tub right next to the patio. The mini bar was refilled promptly ever day (we took full advantage of that perk), and the room service was handy. As a tip though, do not use the room service unless you have to. The food seemed to be prepared earlier and wasn't the most appetizing. Not bad, just I would recommend running down to the buffet. The food as a whole was good for an all inclusive. We stayed for 6 nights so it did get a tad old, but here is the great thing about this resort... we were just a few steps away from the 5th Avenue shopping district! This was great. We spent most of our nights strolling this area (runs from about 1st to 36th). It has shops, restaurants, clubs, etc. We would stop and grab a slice of pizza for $1.50 and maybe a Sol and keep on rolling. But if you are younger tourists (I am 28), be prepared to be propositioned to buy drugs about 5 or 6 times. This got old fast, but it was not a huge deal... guess I look like I needed something to deal with my sunburns! Another tip, make sure you put some sunscreen on your feet!! Haha, yikes the wife and I both toasted our feet. If you want some more authentic fare, you can go a couple of blocks away to get away from the tourist portion of Playa Del Carmen. The wife and I took a stroll out there and there are taco carts and other small dining areas. We also walked out here to take a cab. One of the locals suggested this to us because if you take a cab at the hotel, the fare is about twice as much. We took cab rides to different areas for 20-30 pesos. The hotel pool was nice and if the pool water wasn't cool enough for you, you could just go a few steps farther to the beach and take a refreshing dip in the Caribbean! This was the reason I picked Playacar Palace over Aventura... the beach! We loved it and we used it every day. Also, when we saw Aventura it looked like a giant compound compared to Playacar. I loved the size of our hotel because it was small and personal. Everyone knew our name and we were familiar with many of the other guests because you see them everyday. We talked to some people at the Aventura and it seems like there is more to do on the resort there. This one has a few shows during the week, but for the most part we left the resort every day. So just keep that in mind for what you are looking for. Oh, there is not fitness center. I was dissappionted with that. They will bus you to another shared facility, but it is pretty weak. It is a pretty small room with a couple of machines for cardio, a smith machine with very little weight, and a few other circuit machines. Probably not a problem for most but, even on vacation, I love to start my day off with a good workout. I went to the gym once and didn't go back. We can't wait to go back!

Go to Tulum if you can because it is very beautiful bring lots of bug spray an sunblock too!! We cut our tour short after we ate at Xpu ha Palace that afternoon because my husband was ill (not sure what from but we think it was heat related) The hotel is nice and in a great location. We loved the pool and pool staff. They work hard so tip them if you can afford too. We brought lots of $1 to tip everyone there if they were good. Maids, bellman, servers, bartenders etc.They were happy for the tips and we were greatful for the good service and they always told us it is a Pleasure. I liked having the staff know who you are and use your names. The rooms are nice. I enjoyed the large showers and the jacuzzi in the room as well. We used the safe and had no issues with that. The rooms were well kept and very clean. The front desk, computers and waiting area are all outside in the heat which is interesting but very pretty. It feels like you are in the jungle so bring bug spray. The location is awesome you can not get any closer to 5th. The ferry is right next door although we did not make it to cozumel but we wanted to visit the other resort over there. The fire show on Monday was Awesome and we enjoyed talking to other guests at the hotel as well. Many people are repeat guests. Like I said there were a few flaws but nothing to be upset about. My advice is print all emal correspondence you have with the staff and take it with you so you have names etc. Always print your reservation details etc. This helped us when we were trying to get on the tulum tour our first day there.

We went with another couple. I too like other people, researched and read all of the reviews before we decided to book our trip. We went through Orbizt and were very happy that we chose to go through them. They offered the best prices!! I also wanted to mention that we went through Mexicana airllines and they were great. No charge for your luggage and they offered free meals on all flights. We did first class on the way home and we were treated like first class!! As far as the hotel itself, I think one word would some itup \"FABULOUS\". I have been to other hotels in playa and I will say it's not as fancy and it is a lot smaller just like it says. This is why they have reviews, to let people know a little more about these places. We chose playa because we did not want the big crowds. The location could not have been better. If your not looking to ever leave the resort then this would NOT be the best choice. Stay at maybe Moon or Adventura Palace. This hotel offers FREE phone calls to US, FREE WIFI in ur room and FREE excursions. If u check into the prices of those you will know this is well worth it!! We did the ziplne and wet n wild. By reading previous reviews they would say don't let them talk u into going to listen to the member presentation aka \"time share\". They offered us to go to xcaret for only $30 a person and it's a value of $180 a person. It included transportation lunch and snacks. All for going to a 90 min presentation and we even left without buying anything. We took advantage of staying there (Adventura) and enjoying the resort. We also took the ferry over to Cozumel and had dinner at there resort. The food was really good and u did not have to make any reservations in advance.

It is a smaller hotel and a nice location. We love the staff and place so much we were married at the hotel almost 3 years ago. However we have not been back in about a year and a half and were looking forward to seeing the resort with the beach. I have to admit I was surprised to see some of the negative comments in recent posts. In fact, I almost considered not going back but I am glad that I went back again and plan to return in the future. I did notice some differences which I will quickly mention. There have been some management changes but those are more obvious in the Spa\\Golf Course. The retail parts of it have been closed and the number of staff cutback quite a bit but the spa services were still excellent. The spa was also hit hard by the flu epidemic last year and at one point they had no guests for several days. The resort itself had 16 guests at one point, considering it only contains 220 or so rooms, it was desolate. There have been other changes. The company no longer provides free transportation to work. That means the workers in the Cancun area (Ignacio or Muchacho, Gonzalo and some of the others in the pool bar) are now in Cancun Palace. They commuted since they liked working in a small resort but that is not an option. So Resort members will not see the \"old reliable\" ones but some in the area are still around and new ones (like Juana!) are appearing. The biggest change is the beach. There is a big beautiful new beach that is several miles long!! The Resort of course supplies lounge chairs and services while you are laying out. However we still prefer the pool area. Other reviewers have noted that the beach has changed the resort dynamics. There now day trippers from other Palace hotels and I am sure there will be more in the future. We had not noticed that before. On a warm Saturday a bus from Aventura Palace brought in 50 day trippers and they all went straight to the beach bar and pool area. So it went from a quiet slow day to a loud party crowd. Later that night the restaurants were not prepared for the extra people so service was a bit slow. But that was just one weekend day. Another change is that there appears to be more large parties or small conferences than before. There were more parties of 25 people coming in for three to four days and leaving. My impression is Wyndham is encouraging more of these shorter trips and exposing the resort to people who are not Palace Resort members and the latter, like us, stay for a week or more. These changes are understandable since the economy is bad and the beach has made the resort more appealing to others. But those are my observations about how things have changed since our last trip not necessarily a judgement call on my part. The service is still excellent and the staff are still telling you how much it is a pleasure to serve you and acting like it. The 24 hour room service was very good. Due to flight delays and a long airport transfer we did not arrive until 11 pm. Gaspar was still serving drinks at the Luna Lounge but the restaurants had just closed so we had room service and it was good. The next day we started the daily breakfast binge. My wife always had made to order omlettes or pancakes. I would eat the local Mexican treat--chicken mole, posole, migas, chili verde or whatever it was just to try something new and they were always very tasty. The staff started making me corn tortillas by hand which was a great treat in and of itself so I could have some with my meals! By the end of the week they told me I was eating like a \" real Mexican\" and I took that as a compliment!! Lunch was usually at the pool. We usually had burgers or sandwiches. In the past an older lady (Aurora) worked the grill and always made something ordinary taste better than that. But she was on vacation for 2 weeks. (Resort members know that she was supposed to retire last year at 65. She did temporarily but is now back part-time so she can keep her benefits. She still supports her mother who is in poor health so be sure to tip her when you see her!) Like others we tip regularly. A couple of bucks here and there for housekeeping and meal servers. We also palm a $20 to our favorites bartenders or server when we leave. (Is it me but I just noticed the bartenders are all male and the servers are all female?) They work long days and usually six days a week for about $50 a month. We had dinner at the Italian place or Asian restaurant. The Italian has excellent pastas and steak dinners. The Asian was good. Like others I am not a big sushi fan and the entrees are nothing special but the service is good and the banana dessert is excellent! In fact I recommend the home made ice cream (helado) for dessert. Like others, I am less than impressed with their red wine selection but Angel was always very helpful. Last time we went to a Mexican restaurant in an underground cave but not leave the resort at night this time. Another change was the free internet. When we get away we try to leave our computers at home but were not able to do so this trip. We have some problems but the \"tech\" guy fixed it so we were able to check email from the room. The room was also cleaned and the frig well stocked but for some reason the soap is not changed daily. The social activity people change every year and the shows are different. There is a Micheal Jackson show, circus act, fire acts and of course Karaoke. During the day other activities are now planned around the beach. All in all we wanted to rest, relax and chill. We did not go to Chi-chin Itza or Tulum or anywhere else. We went to 5th to shop one day but the other days we laid around the pool, went for walks on the beach, or hit the fitness center in the spa. All in all it was a perfect stay, still a great location and the staff are still great people.

Finally, after extensive research (which included interviewing individuals who had been married at various hotels in Playa Del Carmen, discussing options with our travel agent and nearly memorizing reviews from numerous websites after thoroughly reading through them), we decided on Playacar Palace. We could not be happier with our decision. We went down with 40 guests ages ranging from 14 to 65. My finace' and I are 25 and 28 and our group of friends are about the same age. Resort was a perfect fit for all! Everything was perfect; all the t's were crossed and the i's were dotted. Not only did we have a simply outstanding wedding, but our guests were thrilled with the resort, the location, the service, the view, the activities and the food. Everyone had a marvelous time! I will break this review down so that readers are able to choose to read what they would like. SERVICE Simply amazing. Everyone in our party was treated like royalty. It was a rare moment that we'd ever have to wait over 30 seconds to be served upon entering a restaurant venue. The servers are so attentive whether you are at the pool, a restaurant or in your room asking the Operator questions or ordering room service. The resort offers 24 hour room service and this was an absolutley perfect perk for our group. We utilized this each and every night and our group was just thrilled that they could order food/drink at any time within the day. The service was out of this world! FOOD There are three restaurants: an Italian restaurant, a buffet and an Oriental restaurant. All are amazing. The Italian is great for a sit down, plated dinner while the buffet is full of multiple options for all (solid vegetarian options, lactose-intolerant options, etc). There are not a lot of options for food, but our group was more than content with what was offered. LOCATION Prime. In the heart of the city if you are looking to explore, but it's tucked away on the beach and feels like it's own little area. Within 10 feet from Senor Frogs (great for our group every night!!) and within 20 feet from the ferry that takes you to Cozumel. Absolutely prime location. ACTVITIES The resort it smaller and more intimate than some. This is something that my fiance' and I had been looking for when selecting our resort. We had wanted a more intimate setting for our group so that we could all be together. This being said, some days it was a bit quiet for activities. This worked fine for us because we are an active, energetic group and created some of our own activities when needed (i.e. beach volleyball, drinking games, swimming in the amazing ocean out front of the hotel). Super Erick is the \"Cheif Entertainer\" and he is magnificent. Charming, witty and full of fun! Whether you are looking to relax in the sun for the day or engage in an activity he is always respectful and and supportive of what you and your group want to do. There are activities each evening in the various bars onsite. Most do close by 11PM, but we then would transition to Senor Frogs for some late night fun and dancing! WEDDING Our wedding planner, Gilberto, was beyond words superior. He was patient, kind-hearted, organized and did his work to ensure a beautiful wedding took place for us. The weeks prior to us arriving we exchanged numerous emails with Gilberto and although at times we felt a bit unsure, because it took him sometimes a few days to respond, he made up for it when we arrived. He is extremely busy as he is the onsite wedding planner for Cozumel Palace, Aventura Palace and Playacar Palace. When we arrived and met with him all felt much assured. The day of the wedding was phenomenal. Everything was absolutely stunning and flawless. It was seamless. We were never concerned that it wasn't going to be because we had spoke with other couples who had been married here and said that although the communication prior to the arrival can be sparse, they know that they are doing. And this is true. The staff execute weddings although it is their job (and it is) and they do a simply amazing job doing it. We had a Welcome Cockatil Hour, Grooms Dinner, Wedding/Reception/Dance and a Farewell Brunch and every single event was marvelous! I think this about covers it!

We liked the idea of the proximity to 5th Street, the ferry to Cozumel, the newly installed beach, and the idea of a smaller all inclusive resort. We were pleasantly suprised when we arrived at the hotel. I appreciated the simple, clean decoration of the resort. Everything within the resort is easy to get to, no matter where your room is located. Our room was on the 4th floor, with just enough ocean view (without asking or paying for it). The rooms are clean, with up to date decor, and didn't have the musty/damp feel that we experienced in Cabo san Lucas. Of course it had the stocked refrigerator, and a safe in the closet. (Oh, and the hot tub, but we didn't use it). The pool area is just right. Swim up bar, umbrellas and shade available for those who prefer it, and plenty of loungers. We intended on spending the majority of our time at the beach, but the activities at the pool proved to be good entertainment while lounging in the sun. Super Eric, Isla, and Gabriel were great with all of the guests and we enjoyed talking with them throughout the week. Anabel and Juana were such sweet and attentive waitresses by the pool. We loved the Miami Vices! Don't get me wrong, the beach here is gorgeous and we spent time there, it was just fun to watch (and occasionally participate) in some of the poolside activities. The food here was quite good for an all inclusive. The made to order options at all meals was great. I especially liked the omlettes and pasta. The Italian restaurant was fabulous. Everything we ordered from the wine to the salads to the steaks were excellent. The Asian restaurant was okay, I'm not big on sushi so I'm not a good person to review it. The fact that you don't have to make reservations at the restaurants is a nice bonus. I think the only thing that may be slightly lacking at this resort is the nightlife. Some of the evening shows/activities are good, but as soon as they are over it seemed like the lounges emptied out and few people hung around . The positive side of this is that you are so close to 5th that you could walk to the local bars/restaurants to continue your evening if you chose to. This will certainly not keep me from returning. We did spend one day in Cozumel. We took the ferry over and had breakfast and spent some time at the Cozumel Palace. Seemed like a nice resort, but no beach. We were never approached about the timeshare meetings, nor did we decide to do any of the tours that were offered. We really didn't want to be on a schedule at all this trip and preferred to lounge and relax. Overall, this was a fabulous trip and I plan to return to the Playacar Palace. It is shocking to read some of the negative reviews written previously. We've stayed at the bigger resorts, and yes they are nice, but the staff at those aren't nearly as personal and friendly and the food doesn't compare. The Playacar Palace is clean, the staff is always smiling/helpful and it was all well worth the price (don't forget to take small bills for tipping, this guarantees great service from the restaurants to the maids). I would recommend it to anyone.

I have traveled to PLaya del Carmen, Cancun and Riviera Maya numerous times I have friends that live there, my in-laws came with us this time and this resort gave them a very good first impression of my country which I so enjoyed. I have stayed at very nice 5 star resorts in this area, however at 4 stars, this place is my favorite for many reasons. Let's get started, I hope this helps. FOOD: Buffet was over the top, tons variety, salads, sushi rolls, soups, fresh fruit, , steaks, fillets, fish, chicken and other seafood at grilling station wow super good and cooked to your taste, pasta station also with about 6 sauces to choose, really something for everybody and different each day we never got sick of it, no matter what diet you are on you will find something delicious to eat here; service was impeccable, everybody was friendly and restaurant was beautiful and clean, with an ocean view, just amazing. Specialty restaurants such as the Italian and the Asian were great too, especially the Italian, they open only for dinner and no reservation is required, always ask in case they are full but we never had a problem getting a table at any given time for dinner. Drinks were always good, don't feel shy and ask for \"double\" if you think they are weak, they have good tequila, I don't drink it but people were saying it was very good and smooth. Every waiter at pool and beach were awesome, they kept my party happy, Juanita served us most days, she was a doll hard working girl never stopped bringing us snacks and drinks, when you have all inclusive this is great, bring singles, because these people are so sweet you are going to want to tip them,we tipped 5 to 10 dollars to our \"pool person\" for the day since it was a big group of us, tip waiters at buffet too, they are so sweet oh Fernando is the best! if you go tell him Paola said hello, he brought our drinks to the table and always asked to help us with our plates since we all had at least 2 because food was just so good, I know I over ate, when I came back home I truly missed the food there, the staff at the buffet also surprised me about 4 different times with a small cake for our anniversary since that is the reason we were all there, staff at the specialty restaurants... OMG the sweetest waiter, Juan at the Italian place, he treated us like royalty, if you don't like the wine they offer you ask for another one, we all found a good wine, my in-laws dine and drink in nice places in Chicago, they were happy too. Room service was very good too we loved it. GROUNDS: The hotel is always clean, I never saw anything dirty, and I am a freak about that; the place is all white so you would notice something right away, it is kept impeccable. Pool is perfect for my taste, swim up bar, not so deep, my kids (5 and 9) were all over without any problems, they swam all day and were under water a lot they truly enjoyed this heated pool. Big enough for the busiest time which never felt busy or crowded, and small enough to see every corner and keep an eye on the little ones. No other kids were there, a lot of couples were shocked to know kids were there when they saw ours, the place really was great for all ages. Beach is BEAUTIFUL, sand was soft, the water was calm and clean, the cleanest beach I've ever been to, plenty of chairs to soak up the sun, no shade yet the beach is new and they cannot put heavy objects on it until I think June, but the pool area is so close we didn't feel like it was a problem, plenty of shade by pool area. ROOMS: We loved our room, we hardly spent any time there, just to shower and sleep, I felt like I didn't enjoy it enough but the beach and weather were so nice all the movies we were going to watch never came out of our suit case. Rooms have a jacuzzi, we had several rooms and we all loved having that right off the balcony! flat screen TV, plenty of storage in closet and drawers, I had to unpack for four and we had plenty of room. The room also has a minibar with beer, juice, pop, water and some liquor dispenser that I never got to use but it looked fun, it had vodka, tequila, rum and something else. Room service was delicious and if you fill out your breakfast sheet the night before they are there on time! I was woken up by my 8am order, how sweet, kids loved getting their breakfast in bed, they have cleaning service twice a day I enjoyed finding chocolates on my pillows when I came back from dinner, beds were great, linens so soft and clean. SPECIAL EVENTS: I ended up not having a formal renewal of vows ceremony for my tenth anniversary, it worked for me to have a big dinner at the Italian place and the hotel decorated the table and gave us champagne at no extra charge. I saw at least 4 weddings and they were beautiful, brides looked happy so consider this place for your wedding =). LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! The place is steps away from the action on 5th avenue, we went to town several times at night we walked since everything was close, we also shopped and walked around feeling safe, Playa del Carmen is truly a beautiful place. QUICK NOTES: Ocean views on 5th floor are the best rooms, (with one king). Try the veal at Italian place, delicious! Shows every night are very good, especially the Brazilian night on Friday and the Michael Jackson show don't miss it the guy is a great performer, ask for super Erick, he is the entertainment manager at the hotel, he keeps the pool, beach and evenings fun and tell him I said hi! Lobby bar was great, kids club was always empty because my kids spent all day in the pool but it looked very clean with great things for children there, we checked it out, staff was very friendly there too. This place is not \"hacienda looking\" like the cute small hotels in town, it is a white simple chic and clean hotel yet it has everything, I am going back soon, nothing, absolutely nothing went wrong in 10 days, that says a lot. Helam is at the upper pool bar, he was incredible we all miss him...

We chose this location because of the Playacar golf course that was a 5 minute shuttle away and the proximity to 5th avenue shops and nightlife. The resort was much better than expected based on the reviews we read over the past month. All of the restaurants were good, the rooms were extremely nice and the service was very good. The pool was a little warmer than we would have liked - it was not refreshing on a 95 degree day. Since many reviews focus on the resort, I will focus on the golf. The Playacar Golf Course is VERY NICE. In terms of Island/resort golf, I would rate it 8/10. I have stayed at the Moon Palace and played their courses (as had our entire 4-some) and we all agreed that this golf course was much nicer. We have also stayed at Breezes Runaway Bay which is a great resort, however, I would only rate their golf course 5/10. It was much more scenic than Moon, had lots of wildlife (including a few families of deer which we saw on a few mornings). The service at the golf course was spectacular - the beer cart came around about every 3 holes and offered snacks, sandwiches, beer, soft drinks and margaritas. Tips were very much appreciated by the staff who were always pleasant and efficient. You were greeted at the end of the round with a very cold cloth (which we needed after a round of 18 in the 95degree heat and they took your shoes and cleaned them. You could also leave your clubs there and they would have them out and ready for your next tee time. I believe rental clubs were $30. Pace of play was excellent, however, there were a couple of days when there were only a half dozen tee-times booked for the entire day. The green fee (regular price $140) was discounted by 30% if you stayed at the hotel, more if you were a Palace timeshare owner. Keep in mind though that the green fee included your cart, all you could eat or drink before, during or after your round and of course the cold cloth at the end (extremely good value for the money). The golf resort was in the same location as the SPA. Clothing/gifts at the pro shop were very reasonably priced also. We did not have a massage at the Spa, although we did get a spectacular massage as OASIS Massage in Playa del Carmen for $23 each. The Oasis spa was very clean, had professional, experienced staff and was very service oriented. It was very comparable to a $120 massage in Toronto. We checked the place out (at the invitation of the owner as we walked by) and then booked for the next day. The resort itself was very slow when we were there (May 1-8th). If not for the proximity to 5th Ave, nightlife would have been non-existent. Although I enjoyed this resort and would recommend it, there are a lot of nice boutique hotels (room only) that I would try since there is such a great selection of restaurants and bars in Playa del Carmen that I would like to try. We gals could walk to the downtown area (in heels no less) in about 10 minutes and felt very safe there at all times. On the weekend we noticed \"tourist police\" driving around in a Smart car. I would recommend Playa del Carmen over Cancun for night life any time - it's got a \"Mexican feel\" but still offers many upscale restaurants, bars and nightclubs. We also really liked the Blue Parrot - great night spot.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201c25th wedding anniversary vow renewal - just beautiful !\u201d", "Author": "BarbieOntario", "ReviewID": "UR64332945", "Content": "Travelled with two families with 5 Teens aged 15 - 20. Been to the carribean and Mexico many times, and have stayed at the Vallarta Palace on the Pacific side. So this was our 2nd experience with a Palace resort and we weren't disappointed. The Playacar is a place to hang your hat, eat & drink to your hearts content, very comfortable beds, good service throughout our stay, and if you want nightlife - although minimal to none at the resort, you've got it next door at 5th avenue. ( The drive to the hotel took about 45 min from the airport but with other hotel drop offs its in excess of an hour, but check in was a snap. Elroy is a star at the front desk) The intent of the trip was to renew our vows and Gilberto the wedding planner did a fantastic job of taking care of everything. To sum up the day - it was absolutely \"perfect\" The photos we took of the beach location for the vows turned out beautiful. We were given multifple options for the location, but we chose the beach hands down. The Minister the hotel provided had us in tears, his words were wonderful. From the flowers to the vow renewal service to the beach & champagne served right afterwards for us all, the Playacar did a brilliant job, and I would recommend the hotel to anyone who is thinking about renewing their vows. They will take care of you and your requests. Another bonus to the Playacar is the poximity to the other Palace resorts on the coast (there are more in Cancun but we didn't visit them) We travelled to Cozumel, Aventuras Cove, Xpu-ha, & the Moon Palaces during our stay (Payacar definately has the best beach). Moon palace shuttle was included, the others you have to hire a cab. Xpu-ha was an incredibly unique Palace resort, and I highly recommend a visit for a couple hours to see the lush jungle, animals, and get some kayaking/snorkeling in. Aventuras provided us with a complimentary room to shower up to dress for dinner, very nice touch, all we did was ask, and we heard the usual response \"it is my pleasure\" Our teens participated in the beach volleyball, and the odd event in the pool, however they were content to just chill on the lawnchairs. They wanted to play tennis, but never did ask where they were located. (courts off site) They worked out in the gym at the Cozumel palace but not at the Playacar (again gym off site). Some of them brought laptops and there is free internet and wifi in the rooms, also free calls to North America - seriously ! Food was very good, enjoyed both the italian and the teens liked the Asian - they loved the deep fried ice-cream. They also ordered lots of room service throughout the trip, club sandwiches, fries and chocolate cake,. Us Adults often ordered shrimp coctails, and salmon/crackers with wine from room service , as we got ready for dinners - oh if life could only be like this everyday ! As all the reviews say, 5th avenue is a very cool sensory experience. Lights, sounds, music, marachi bands, food smells, people - where do they all come from ?? Lots of excitement. We went everynight to walk around. Buy a cold cervesa from one of the vendors on 5th and enjoy your stroll......very cool indeed. We always walked back to the hotel via the beach, very safe. One night we stopped at \"Fusion\" - live band on the beach with muskoka chairs, nice ambiance. Senior Frogs right next door was happening everynight too if that is your thing. The hotel unfortunately suffers for any nightime entertainment/action, but thats to be expected with competition like 5th avenue. We did not take any free tours, as we have already done the ruins, ziplining, ATVing etc, and just travelling to the other resorts for the day was a good enough change for us. It allowed the kids to check out new sites, pools, games etc. & you always discover new \"bar drinks\" at each resort. One thing PP needs to do is put some umbrellas or palapas on the beach. The newly restored beach is just beautiful but you need shade ! As you read other reviews, you can pretty much determine what to expect from PP. We try not to expect too much from the resorts we visit, We like a nice beach, good food, good drink & good service and we got all of the above.

( definitely rent a vw convertible when you arrive for an awesome ride around the island.. we did the scooters and got really sunburned..) it felt like we had all the bonuses of a resort but didn't feel trapped. the pool was great, though they only had one, only one out of the seven days we were there did it feel crowded. and that mostly had to do with rude people who left their towels on their chairs under the umbrella all day and not even use it! i ended up moving them.. come people! But the rest of the time there were plenty of chairs and umbrellas. the only down fall was there were no umbrellas to use on the beach. i would have loved to hang out on the beach more but my skin couldn't handle all that sun. but the beach was nice and water warm. i was definitely nervous about the food as well before i got there. but it was better than expected. the italian restaurant was really good as was the service there. the mexican buffet was good. we noticed the food was better if you got there closer to when it opened and your best bet was to get something that was made to order, like the fish fajitas, pasta, etc. the same was true for breakfast, i had wonderful omeletts every morning. the only real disappointment was the asian restaurant. it was just bad. and you could kinda tell because there was hardly ever anyone in there. it's kinda sad they would be better off just opening something new. the chips and guac from the pool side bar were amazing and they were great about drinks. the waitresses were very attentive as well. overall we had a good time. we are not picky travelers though. give us good drinks, a pool and some good food we are happy. its all what you make of it. it wasn't the best food in my life but not the worst. oh i did use the spa as well, it was very nice and they were very attentive. it was only about a 5 minute shuttle ride from the hotel and i didnt wait more than 5 mins for each. overall it was better than i expected and i would visit again.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFabulous vacation!\u201d", "Author": "bijou77", "ReviewID": "UR63459332", "Content": "It was the best vacation we 've had.

On a scale from 1 to 10 I'd rate it a 5. During our stay there were 3 weddings. Being such a small place, the wedding parties really made for cramped quarters. One or the other of the two bars was always \"Wedding Party Only\" and the main Italian restaurant was crowded with their quests. You might want to ask if any weddings are booked for the time you are considering staying before you book. The thing about Playacar Palace is that it is no \"Palace\"... it is more a hotel than a resort. It is, however, located in a great area of the Riviera Maya. Playa Del Carmen's 5th Avenue is just steps away, the ferry to Cozumel is right outside the front door, Senor Frog's is right next door, and if you are adventurous the ADO bus station is just a walk away. Mexico has replaced the beach that the hurricanes took away, and there are beach chairs out for guests but, unless you are ready to bake in the sun, don't sit there because they do not provide any umbrellas. We are members and felt that we did not get treated any differently than non members. We did received a \"VIP\" room which consisted of a one cup coffee maker that didn't work, a pillow menu from which we could choose our \"special\" pillows, \" aroma therapy\" which consisted of an electric burner with scented oils, an I Pod dock, and supposedly upgraded liquor. BIG DEAL. Very dissapointing. We didn't go on any of the included tours or golf and I'd be interested in hearing from someone who did actually use the course. We did use the \"Spa\" which you shuttle van to. The hot tub was cool both times I used it. There is one thing that I have to give them credit for. I forgot my wallet with $200 cash and all my credit cards near the lobby. The front desk called to say they had found it and I went to the front lobby to get it without a single thing missing. Incredible! Just keep in mind that this is a hotel not a resort. Buffet and just two restaurants get pretty boring by the end of the week. Food is just O.K. Avoid sitting with anyone when you first check in that wants to explain all the hotel has to offer. They really just want to hook you into a sales presentation.

My spouse and one other person in our group got a parasite from the food. - the wedding planners really messed up the \"back up plan\" for our friend's wedding.

Food - decent/average - as other reviewers have written way too salty at asian; italian restaurant was quite good; buffet is definitely hit or miss and they should do a better job of making sure quality is better (i.e. brown pineapple, food that has sat out for too long). However, the made to order food at the buffet was quite good - fajitas, omelettes, etc. Also.....it was frustrating to have to ask for chips/salsa/guac when we were outside at the pool. Typically, it could take 15-20 minutes to get an order of something that didn't require any cooking. Room Service -- good -- reliable (20-30 minutes max); freshly cooked food and they will accommodate other things not on the menu; available 24 hours Pool - exactly as pictured on website; didn't think it was too small as april is off-peak; there wasn't a huge demand for chairs until mid/late morning; the music/games are not obnioxious and eric with the entertainment staff is quite good Location - EXCELLENT as it is right next to senor frogs and has a great beach. Service - ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!! We had absolutely awful service in the buffet restaurant every single morning. We usually had to flag down someone to wait on us with coffee and then had to flag someone down for refills. 2 days before our departure, I actually went and took one of the coffee carafes from the server's station and brought it to my own table. NEVER did anyone ask if there was a problem or if there was a reason I did that even after seeing the carafe on my table. I complained to the buffet manager and his reaction was that no one else has complained about their service. What he fails to realize is that many people complained about service while waiting to be served, but few people want to go and voice a complaint when they are on vacation. I must say the management at the buffet during the evening was very accommodating and pleasant. Also, the women who made omelettes, pancakes, etc. was wonderful with a smile on her face all the time. The pool service was inconsistent as well -- there were a few servers (Anabel in particular) who were always friendly but the rest seemed like they had a chip on their shoulder. The pool bar staff was incredibly friendly too. Housekeeping - TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE - We asked 4 times on our first day to have our room cleaned and didn't get it cleaned until 7:30 PM. The 3rd time we asked we went to the front desk and they PROMISED it would be cleaned ASAP (that was at 5PM). We went back to our room at 6:30PM and it hadn't been done. We rarely had our room turn-downed and after our problem on our first day, we still had issues with housekeeping... Other pet peeves...we had ordered champagne and dessert for a special occasion to be delivered to our room and it never came...we were supposed to have a 6:30 AM wake-up call on the morning of our departure and it naver came...housekeeping would knock on our door with the \"do not disturb\" sign hanging and then they wouldn't clean the room when we had the \"clean our room please\" sign out (many others had this issue)....housekeeping wouldn't leave new soap when we clearly needed some...All in all, we enjoyed our stay because we were on vacation but the hotel was overpriced for a property that claims to be 4-star.

Still loved it. I found both the Italian restaurant and the Asian to be much better than last time. The cream cheese in most of the sushi rolls is still weird, but lots of other sushi selections were great. My travelling companions ordered rice/noodle dishes and really liked them. I don't think there was anything at the Italian restaurant that I really disliked. Loved the steak! Be aware that at both these restaurants they bring out a lot of appetizers in addition to whatever appetizers you order. Some of the stuff ends of being duplicates of what you already ordered. First couple of times I ate so much appetizers that I don't think I enjoyed my mains, so pace yourself!!! The buffet is excellent quality even though it is not big. It does get pretty repetitive after the 3rd day, especially since the dinner stuff and lunch stuff is pretty similar. That being said, it's pretty much the same complaint of 99% of the All-Inclusives around. The best you can hope for in most All-Inclusive buffets is good quality ingredients, preparation and taste, even if it is repetitive and for the most part the Playacar Palace buffet has all of that. The service in all restaurants and bars is great. People are very friendly and will try and accommodate you. The new beach is great (compared to what it was before). The old, tiny beach was really the only major drawback before. Location right in the main Playa Del Carmen district is amazing. It rained the first few days we were there. The staff do what they can to provide indoor activities, but based on the size of the resort, it can get boring if you're locked in for a couple of days with kids. Every alternate day, they have professional shows. The Brazilian and Circus shows were fantastic. On the other days they have staff provide entertainment/games in the evening. If anyone is interested in the baby sitting service, I can say that we were very happy with the lady they sent. Although all our kids were sleeping by the time she arrived, she seemed like she would be more than capable of looking after them. They charge Canadian/American rates ($15hr plus transportation and minimum 4 hrs), so if you get one, make sure you plan on going out for a few hours. We had no regrets in using the service the one night. For parents on young children, here are a few things to consider: Playacar Palace is small, so there are pros and cons of that. Pros You can get around the entire property very, very quickly with young kids and you can get back to your room quickly if you forget something or need to change them. You can eat in any of the 3 restaurants and easily order stuff from the other restaurants if your kids are picky. The staff don't even flinch. It's 1 kitchen for all 3 restaurants. Your kids may get one-on-one treatment at the kids club (see below for cons of this). Damaris, the lady usually running it is great and did whatever the few kids wanted to do. Cons. Since it is a small and not particularly cheap resort, there are not a lot of kids. Even though there is a kids club, if there are only 1 or 2 kids registered, they can't follow the formal activity schedule and end up free-styling the program based on who is there, which usually means TV/video games or board games. Teenagers may get particularly bored unless they are with a lot of similarly aged kids. Regardless, all staff seem to extend big welcomes to kids. Non-Resort Related Tips: We ate in town at one of the places on 5th Avenue. Great atmosphere, but below average food at very expensive prices. Probably going off the main strip to eat is a better bet for value. Went to XPU-HA for the day. $20 cab ride each way. Neat to see and more activities for kids (zoo, lagoon with Manatees and fish to feed), mini-waterpark. However XPU-HA was almost empty when we went, so lunch buffet was tiny (but great quality). Walking to different parts of the resort would take a while. Shopping on 5th Avenue is pretty expensive. In fact, most of the booze we checked out was cheaper in the Duty Free at the airport and clothes were cheaper in the hotel gift shop.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cThe Good & the Ugly\u201d", "Author": "RandPIndiana", "ReviewID": "UR61850111", "Content": "This was our 5th stay at a palace resort since 2007 and the 1st at this particular resort. We have enjoyed each and every stay at Palace resorts. Playacar Palace is a small resort with a great location next to the ferry pier and PlayaDelCarmen's 5th avenue attractions. The resort is wonderful, the workers are friendly, and the food is fantastic. The gym and spa is a 5-minute shuttle ride or a 20 minute walk away. We also visited the Cozumel, Averntura Spa, and Xpu-Ha Palace resorts which are nearby. You can use their spa facilities, eat at the resturants, and hang out at the pools.

I have been to 5 and they range from tolerable to horrible, this trip it was horrible. I am already a Palace Premier memeber and have already upgraded once, yet I don't understand why they would pressure an already established member so heavily to upgrade further. My advice is that if you really want the free spa treatments or attraction tickets and you have a strong stomach then go for it. Otherwise stay away. If you want to get the member pricing, just go to ebay and buy a week. Right now non-member pricing is about the same as member pricing so being a member isn't worth it. Email me and I'll explain further. Also after we fullfilled our obligation to attend, we got the free Xcaret tickets, then later found out we had to pay $61.00 for them. I had to talk to 3 people to convince them to uphold their end of the agreement. When they agreed to correct the matter, I thought all was well.

I just felt so inclined to write this review since we had such a bad experience at this hotel. We have stayed in Mexico several times - Moon Palace, Grand Porto Real, The Royal, Mayan Palace, and now the Playacar Palace. I would return to all of the above but NOT to Playacar. We stayed because of the positive reviews (which I now believe are fixed), and the location, and the fact that it was a smaller hotel. I am so huge on having a nice room and a view and I always order the ocean view room and expect to get what we pay for. We brought our 15 year old daughter with us and we were given a room with ONE KING size bed. Now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that a king bed is just not going to fly. We said two beds, ocean view. They offered to put a cot in the room but after viewing the room, we would have had to have it at the end of the bed and we would have all had to walk over it to get to the patio. After arguing for quite sometime and then been given the suggestion several times that we go to a different resort (excuse me), I finally had to pay another $700 to upgrade to a larger room. Now if your a 4* hotel and your customer is paying over $6,000.00 for a one week vacation, wouldn't you think they would accommodate? Don't book the room if you don't have it. I even called prior to arrival to make SURE they got it right. The manager (can't remember her name) was very rude. I'm still wondering why I gave her a $50 tip for letting me pay more money for a room that I should have gotten in the first place. We just felt like trash the rest of the week. There were some positives to the hotel and still a few more negatives. Anabel at the poolside and Nora at the beach were so wonderful in serving us every day. We will never forget them and thank them for our wonderful days. The room we did end up getting was a suite and it was nice and spacious, my daughter had her own side to the room with her own TV. The bathrooms were superbly small, especially in the regular rooms. The room service food was horrible, the maid service was not the best, and they turned down our bed once. The food was the same every day in the buffet and the Italian restaurant was awesome but after spending the day in the sun my husband refused to put his jeans on with a sunburn to go in there every night, so you eat buffet, yuk. The location of this hotel is awesome. I love to shop the stores on Fifth Avenue and have met some wonderful store owners that remember us. The pool was not the best and dirty on some days. Straws and cups laying around in the water. The large chess set was broken and crumbling. The hallway to our room had cherry stuff spilled on the floor and never was cleaned during our stay. The beach is awesome and Super Eric at the pool was a hoot.

Perhaps 75% of the staff are wonderful but the other 25% are questionable. The spa is great. The other things you go to an all inclusive resort for are adequate, not exceptional. Granted there are some very good values for packages due to the bad economy but for a VIP Founding Member promised much better by management upon purchasing same, it is a bad deal.

The ground transportation with Best Day Travel was swift though we made 3 stops to other resorts before we arrived at our destination. Check-in was smooth and we refreshed ourselves with cool hand towels and sparkling wine from the very friendly and professional staff. We decided to do a little better this year so we reserved one of the 6 Honeymoon suites- a great deal through Expedia for less than $400 per nite. It pays to do your research and get familiar with the hotel layout for a room to your liking beforehand. Ours was ocean front with a separate living room which had a plasma TV, minibar, refrig stocked with water, beer, juice and soda as well as 4 liquor dispensers, ice bucket, etc. The same set-up was in the bedroom amoire. There is marbled bath and shower, a king-sized bed and a double jacuzzi facing a huge patio/deck combo and the sparkling, clear blue ocean. The furniture and bedding seemed very modern for my taste, certainly not outdated by any traveler's reasonable standards and yes the mattresses in Mexico are more firm than elsewhere as we already know. After hours of day-tripping, golfing, drinking , eating, swimming and lounging, let's face it, half of us wouldn't feel a bed of nails! I'm glad to say that when we we there, there were no beach chair games as there seemed to always be enough loungers for everyone whether you were near the pool, the pool bar or on the beach. AHHHH - the beach was glorious! Clear, clean, sparkling water, wonderful waves and lots of sand. They did a great job building the beach back for everyone to enjoy. We also enjoyed the food everyday. if you are one who does not excercise or expand your palate when you travel abroad you'll still find Americanized standards at all meals here but can't cast blame of being bored with \"nothing to eat\" or \"they had the same thing everyday\". As in other countries including ours, chefs showcase their own regional favorites and styles at each meal. You might not like everything but it won't be because they did not try. Pulled pork and potato, crispy veal and veggies, refied beans, sweet corn, green peppers and cream, chicken or beef tortillas, tortas, fish tacos were among the many different dishes you can try in the buffet restaurant. And CRAZY desserts! Trust me -DO NOT MISS THE COCONUT ICE CREAM OR YOU\"LL BE SORRY! For fitness fiends there are many veggie choices and two tasty, healthy juices to note: beet, carrot and orange juice, and the pineapple, parsley and lime juice. Oh, and there's always a made-to-order station for breakfast omlettes, pancakes and waffles or at lunch for stir fry or fajitas. Geez-what's not to eat? The pool and beach area had daily activities: water volleyball and excercise class, beach volleyball, a life-sized chees board or you can go \"lobby -to-lobby\" to the Playacar Golf and Spa Club for Pilates (reformer or mat), Tae Bo, or circuit-training classes or of course golf or spa services. I cannot say enough about the staff. Once they knew we were celebrating our anniversary, they went out of their way to help us celebrate. A cake and bottle of wine in the room the first night; white chocolate covered strawberries the next day at breakfast and a champagne dinner at a very private, tastfully decorated table in the Italian restaurant on the night of our anniversary. Housekeeping was prompt and efficient, the place was clean, landscaped beautifully and the staff always answered \"it is our pleasure \" to any request or \"thank you\". There was even a wedding on the beach while we were there but it did not impede or interrupt anyone's day of sun or fun. The entertainment shows were what they were but we missed the most popular fire show that some travelers said was very good. 5th Avenue is within walking distance as is the ferry terminal. Shopping in town is a haggle-fest so be ready. With a few exceptions most vendors have the same things so walk away often then go back to the store you like and offer you bottom price. I would say for a Mexican all-inclusive resort Playacar Palace was worth every penny we spent. They should be commended for the level of service, staff and food they provide and for not compromising when other resorts are cutting back and STILL charging $400 or more a night. Between the room, staff, beach, food and atmosphere if you want \"better,\" than this pay way more and go the Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental.

The hotel is located right beside the Ferry to Cozumel. You can actually walk 50 feet from the hotel and get on the Ferry. It will cost you $11 each way and the Ferry leaves almost every hour on the hour. There's also a tremendous amount of shops at the Ferry area. It's definitely a hot spot! There's only 3 restaurants in the hotel. One has the international buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The other 2 are only open for dinner. One is Italian and the other is Asian (basically Chinese food.) We ate mostly at the Italian restaurant since it was so good. Room service was great too! The gym is nice. There are 2 treadmills, 2 elliptical machines, bikes, free weights and Life Fitness machines. The also have classes daily. You'll have to check the activities sheet for the day to see what the classes are. There is a Lobby to Lobby shuttle from the hotel to the gym/Spa area. It's about a 7 minute ride from the hotel to the gym due to all the one-way streets and about a 5 minute ride on the way back. It's definitely walkable too. The Spa is great.

The only draw back was very early in the AM the exhaust fans for the kitchen (or something) would kick on and it produced a rumbling sound that would wake us up.

The food was good, we ate in all three restaurants and had good service in the Italian and Asian restaurants. I can't really comment on the buffet service since you are kind of on your own there anyway. The food would get old if you are there longer than 5-7 days though. The wine selection was poor. Our room was very clean, and our maid service was great. Flower petals on the jacuzzi tub at night (we never used it since I never know how those things are cleaned).

A government funded project has replaced the sand that was washed away by a hurricane several years ago and a huge, soft sand, seaweed-free wide beach now runs in front of the hotel. You can walk south on the beach very far, we got as far as the Riu and it still looked endless. Lots of people walk and run on this grand beach now (the public beach to the north remains as beautiful as ever). So there is beach now, it is grand and is there high or low tide. However, inspite of what the public relations folks will tell you, Playacar Palace is obviously feeling some effects of the world wide recession. Just little things - like no complimentary mouthwash, they're using up their overstock of boxed \"25th Anniversary\" guest soaps, etc. And don't forget your toothbrush-our guest services liason suggested I purchase on in the gift shop when I asked her for one (yes I forgot mine). I asked the maid instead and she was able to find me one quickly. And about the hotel gift shop- as Palace members we always received a discount on anything we bought at the gift shop as one of our member benefits. Well, fellow Palace Members, that discount is GONE at any of the Palace resorts. Funny, I thought that was in our contract. In fact, when we upgraded last year to the Presidential level (silly us), the discount increased. Poof! Now it's gone. And the 24 hour concierge that we were promised was part of our Presidential level upgrade? He directed us to the main desk to schedule the manicure/pedicure/back massage. That's right . They told us as presidential members we'd never wait in that line again. Upon gently complaining that we were missing part of our benefit we were told that we should have arranged all that from home before we arrived. So I guess I was supposed to plan what time and day we wanted everything from golf to spa services ahead of time? Then why the letter upon arrival at the resort informing us that our personal concierge was there at extension 50 to schedule all of our desired services. Apparently that was only in effect if I could produce that very letter to the person I was complaining to. I think it 's kind of a cultural thing. They are very paper oriented. Without our original contract in hand, there was no more gift shop discount. Suddenly the $1000 peso coupon for spa services didn't cover manicures or pedicures, even though they are listed services in the spa/salon brochure. They became salon services and thus not eligible. Golf fans, listen up. There is a secret promotion going on for golf . It is $70.00 dollars US for 18 holes, including cart, not club rentals. This is down from last years $190.00. Part of our package upgrade to Presidential was 50% off golf. But at the $190.00 amount. So we saved our half price golf rounds, paid for full price golf and got a better deal. And afternoon golf is only $35.00. We asked to golf folks how long this promotion would last and they didn't know. Hey, even the guy we booked the golf times with at the desk (lost that darn concierge person again!) didn't know they had a promo going on. He was going to give us our half price rate which was more than the promo rate and had to call the golf course people to confirm that he really should charge us just the $70.00. Eiii Yiii Yiii Yiii. My favorite part at the golf course was asking to buy a golf glove. They were all hanging nicely behind the counter and the clerk told me that none of them would fit me because they were all mens. I told her that was ok, just give me a mens small size. She said all they had was XL. So I said ok, I'll have to use that, please give me one. She reluctantly did, I tried it on, it was better than no glove for me. After I paid for my glove, my senior moment passed and I thought, Geeze, what kind of an upscale golf shop only supplies XL men's gloves? So I put on my glasses and leaned over the counter where I saw various sizes. So, I says,\" senorita, there's a medium right there\". She of course had to look and I exchanged my men's XL for it. I looked at her in wonderment and said, \"You said you only had XL???? To which she replied,\" oh sorry. \" I like to call it Magical Mexican Thinking- they make stuff up and if you can't prove otherwise you have accept it as fact. So be an informed resort vacationer consumer and you will be your own best advocate to get what you paid for and, as we found, with perserverance, you can even be your own best concierge. Palace management, I can only say that the little things are what can set you apart from all the other resorts along the Playa del Carmen strip. You can send 10 guest services people up to me at various times asking if everything is ok, but they are only talking the talk. They gotta do the job. One more wacky thing. The buffet serves wonderful food. But upon arrival to the buffet restaurant the hostess escorts you to your table and assists you into your seat. Your servers names are told to you, although they will introduce themselves again when they appear in person. A napkin is ceremoniously placed into your lap and then the hostess tells you to help yourself to the buffet. So of course you remove the napkin and get back up. This napkin thing got to be a bit of a joke for us. Walk in, sit down, get napkined, remove napkin, get up, get food. Like I said, it's the little things. Yes we'll go back. It's immaculate, great location to golf course and beach, great food and we've pre-paid for weeks. (Oh that's right, those are \"free\" weeks) But next time I'll have our contract and upgrade papers on hand.

Its decor is not overripe like a lot of tourist resort hotels, rooms are spotless, cool (with individually controllable thermostats) and restful -- and the staff is exceptionally warm and friendly. The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet available in the cafe is broad, diverse, fun and time-saving (though prepared hot dishes tend to be overcooked, as is not uncommon with buffets). The pool area didn't seem quite large enough to support a fully booked hotel, but it too is attractive and relaxing. My complaints about the Playacar Palace have to do with an unconscious indifference to some aspects of customer service that most hotels at this cost level are careful to provide. First, there is no business center, and the two free PC's in the lobby cannot print boarding passes. So you have to go the reception area, where they hand you a laptop, which they hook up to the printer at that location. This is a bit laborious, and obviously can serve only one person at a time, and then only if the reception/front-desk people aren't busy. Second, the paper wristband (which has a number) that they require you to wear is your only means of making purchases at the gift shop or obtaining meals throughout your stay -- you can use cash only for tips. They combine that with not showing you the cost of meals at the main cafe unless you inquire. This is clearly a system intended to make you spend more at the hotel, and to that extent is more about enhancing their revenue than enabling you to manage your trip. These are annoyances, not major problems, but they compromise the faultless courtesy toward guests, in that it's clear that while the hotel staff wants you to enjoy yourself, the hotel is organized to make sure you pay for that enjoyment. Moreover, I learned while in Playa del Carmen that some of the hotels that require guests to wear wrist-bands are the targets of protests from local groups representing workers; such groups allege various forms of exploitation of workers. The sway of large tourist-hotel developers along the Riviera Maya is not an entirely benign influence, it would seem. As for Playa del Carmen, it's a lively Mexican town with a lot of good local food eateries and a life of its own detached from tourists.

The suite also offered a double in-room jacuzzi and an amazing ocean view. The closet provided a safe and lots of space as did the dresser. We travelled with our 15 year old daughter who also enjoyed the room. Food was exceptional-something for everyone. We particularly enjoyed the Italian restaurant and dined there three of our seven nights. Don't pass up the parmagiano creme soup! My husband always ordered the chef's nightly special and was never disappointed; each of us were delighted with every meal! Palace Resorts have recently upgraded their wine list and it showd the wines were very good and a pleasure to drink. Don't miss the Mayan coffee! Davido was a wonderful server-as were the rest of our waiters at the Italian restaurant. Don't forget to tip. Every breakfast we were greated by Fernando and Geraldo at the buffet. They both made our stay that much more enjoyable. We missed them during their days off! \"Hola gentlemen\"! There is plenty of food to suit everyone and a chef is standing by at every meal to prepare something just for you! We did not order room service so no comments there. The entertainment was excellent the staff were amazing! We were a bit concerned that our daughter would be bored but there was no chance of that. Between the poolside activities and the evening entertainment she was quite busy meeting new friends from around the world. The only downside to the activities was that you could hear what was going on around the pool (loudspeaker) while trying to have an afternoon nap-we closed the patio door. The included tours were also a great deal of fun and wonderful adventures in themselves. We did spend a day at the spa and highly recommend using the hydrotherapy room prior to your treatment. My husband and I had a romantic couples massage and were thrilled. Our daughter and I enjoyed manicures and pedicures. Wonderful staff at the spa too! Located in the heart of Playa del Carmen provided easy access to shopping and local life. Here was a my huge surprise-Mexico is known for its silver-so a negotiated what I thought was a fair price for a couple of items in Playa. When I was roaming through the hotel I went in the 'Palace Jewelery' store and was really pleasently surprised by the prices-they were better than I have found in Playa! Items at the gift store (Palace Shop) were also very reasonably priced. While there is not a huge beach at the resort it is an incredible beach, beautiful sand bottom and great waves for body boarding! We were pleasantly surprised. Last year we visited Xel-Ha and were thrilled; this year we went to XCaret and we thrilled again. If you want something fun for an outing go to either or both of these sites you will not be disappointed. Both parks can have about 3000 people in them and you'd never guess there were more than 300 there. At Xel-Ha don't miss the river float and at XCaret the underground river was not to be missed-we did the one that was all underground-very impressive! This was an amazing resort-we will definately return!!", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "finallyanewlywed", "ReviewID": "UR50419114", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon, it was amazing.

My wife and I went for our 1 yr. anniversary, and we splurged for \"consierge level\" thinking we would get superior service and attention. Not so. The only difference is a pillow menu and aromatherapy (which is just a heated fragrance gel) in your room. Other than that, there was virtually no difference, so save your hard earned money. They say that \"consierge level\" gets you a better room, lso not true. It was a standard room (still very nice though), just on a higher floor and a bigger balcony. All rooms are ocean view and have a balcony. A few things to be aware of and avoid: 1) Take a private taxi to and from the airport. $44 each way and worth every penny. With the resort shuttle, you are at the mercy of their schedule, and you'll wait for other guests flights to arrive and make pick-ups and drop offs at other resorts. *Thanks to Tripdvisor we avoided this hassle!* 2) Do everything in your power to avoid the Spa/Golf/Tours booking desk. It will take you HOURS to get anything done with them. Of course if you want the spa and golf, you will have no choice. For all other excursions, grab a taxi and go. These peole are independant travel agents and do not work directly for the resort. Tey don't d anything fast. It took us nearly 2hrs to book spa treatments, a trip to Tulum, and a scuba trip. They do this multiple times a day, nd you'd think it ws for the first time. 3) AVOID THE TRNSPORTATION FOR THE INCLUDED TOURS! The places themselves are great, we went to Tulum. They say it's a 40 minute drive (as opposed to 3 hrs for Chicen-Itza), so thats why we chose it, didn't want to spend a whole day on a bus. But wait!! There's a catch!! The 40 minute trip took 2hrs 45mins! First a 30 minute van ride to Aventura Palace to pick up people, then a bus which stopped at 8 MORE RESORTS. We were so angry with this that after the tour we took a taxi back to the resort. (40 mins. $30) About half of the people on the bus did the same. I cn only imagine what it would have been like if we went to Chichen-Itza. I heard that it's almost 5 hours each way when you factor in all of the stops. (others told me that it's 2 hrs in a taxi for $60) Oh, and if you go to Tulum, skip the $5 for the trolley and walk for less than 5 minutes. Also, bring a bathing suit and towel, there is a beautiful beach there. They will try to sell you bug spray, but you won't need it. Maybe it was just the breeze, but there were no bugs for us. Overall, it was a good trip, the resort is very nice, and very quiet. If you're looking for a lively party vibe, consider Moon Palace or Aventura Spa Palace.

This was a beautiful hotel and is in an even better than excellent location. 12 nights would normally not be too long but when it rains it is! My wife and I went for our honeymoon. The honeymoon package was included at no extra fee. (impressive??? no, free/included yes) We ran into some super crappy weather . It rained about 75% of the time which included hurricane IDA (a category 1 hurricane). CLEANLINESS was great with the exception of the pool being a little dirty but I must cut them some slack due to a hurricane filling the kiddy pool with sand and the main pool with salt water. SERVICE: All aspects of service were amazing everyone does everything you ask them and with a smile on their faces. I didnt tip for everything but i definetely tipped when i felt necessary. Mara at the front desk was a sweetheart. She made sure we were happy and went out of her way to make my wife's birthday special. She went above and beyond! When raining they gave us umbrellas to use when going into town (big ones too) The rest of the front desk and the activities/tour desk people did not impress me. Poolside \"super eric\" was great but the activities were boring! (guess how many poker chips are in a cup for a chance to win a crappy t-shirt????) not my idea of a fun activity. They needed to step it up big time especially when people are paying thousands of dollars to come and are stuck doing nothing due to weather. The bartenders up in the lobby area and the luna lounge barstaff were great. (Karina, little Martha, Josue, and Luis) make sure to ask Josue to see his magic tricks. LOCATION: CANT BE BEAT. If only we had nice weather it would have been perfect. This hotel is literally 50 yards from the start of 5th avenue. If you are celebrating a special occasion go to Casa Del Aqua for dinner. GREAT MEAL AND AMAZING SERVICE! (GET THE TABLE SIDE CESAR SALAD) If anyone has been to PLAKA in Athens, i would somewhat describe 5th avenue as being like the Plaka. The Cozumel ferry dock was about a baseball throw away from the hotel, and the hotel was located right on the beach which I believe all rooms have an oceanview. The downside. It is so close to the beach that the hurricane ended up bringing waves and sand into our pool and the actual beach that there is, is small. The dinner staff was great. 3 restaurants to choose from and a 24 hr room service menu. Selection??? not great for the late night room service but it all tasted yummy after drunk dialing the front desk to order. VALUE: I spent a lot to go here. I talked to friends who were down the road towards Xcaret and they said their place sucked from food to service to location etc... I believe it was the Grand Occidental Xcaret. However when paying a big price I believe it should include airport transfer!!! When I have to pay $92 on the palace website for round trip airport transfer and then wait for other peoples flights to come in that pissed me off! When I have to go to the airport 4 hours early that pisses me off. If i pay $92 I want to go when I want to go! When guests are getting $150 spa credit for 1 week and I stay 2 weeks and only get $150 spa credit that pissed me off. I think they could have done a little more to accomodate such a long stay. One thing I wish we did was visit the ruins. After all the rain stopped all we had time for was swimming with the dolphins, an ATV tour which included zip lines and a cenote, a couples massage and laying by the pool getting fatter. Go see the ruins, go to the adventura spa for the \"time share\" presentation. its not long from what i hear and they give you a crap load of spa credits. We missed out on that. The couples massage was great. The spa and gym are both located about 5 min off site. Hope this helps. Pray for good weather cuz if it rains there really isnt much to do besides hang out in the room, lobby, or buy a poncho and go sight seeing.

They try so hard but with capacity at 12% there aren't a lot of people to work with. They definately made the best of it and played to the folks they had. There were a few nights there were only 4 or 6 of us playing cards in the lounge but it was a blast. Very personal. Super Eric and Juan took very good care of us both during the day around the pool and in the evening. With so few people it was very casual and fun. But there was no pressure from them to participate. There were times we just said no and they left music playing so we could relax. The food and restaurant service. Where to begin. Thanks Fernando, Sergio, Jazz, Juan and all the others who took such good care of us. The chefs were falling all over themselves to try and make special dishes that we enjoyed. One mention of shrimp and the next thing I knew I had this gorgeous plate of sauteed shrimp in wine and butter in front of me. Desserts, I think I had the best dessert I've ever had in the Mexican Restaurant. Ask for the strawberries flambae. Magnificant. Housekeeping and turndown. What great people.

My children already want to start making plans to go back. When you first arrive, they greet you with ice cold washcloths for your face along with a refreshing drink. For the 1st couple of days my daughters kept trying to order the \u201cwelcome\u201d drink and we kept getting various smoothies and other drinks. Finally, when I realized the waiter had no idea what I was talking about, I just said, how about some fruit punch (thinking it was probably going to be Hi-C type fruit punch). Well, that was the right name \u2013 ordering fruit punch at the 3 Palace resorts we visited got us the correct drink every time! The staff is wonderful. They genuinely seem interested in making sure you are having a good time. Everyone has a smile and an \u2018Hola\u2019 for you. I don\u2019t think I ever sat anywhere for longer than 5 minutes without someone asking if I would like a drink or anything else. If we ever even remotely looked like we wanted or needed something, they were right there. Most of the staff speak excellent English. In talking with several of them, it seemed clear that they enjoyed their job. Several of them had started working in housekeeping and moved up into better jobs. We tipped, not because I felt like getting good service depended on it, but because I really wanted to reward how well we were being treated. I tipped in both dollars and pesos (20 peso = ~$1.50), depending on what I had at the time. We used an ATM at the airport and at Cozumel palace to get pesos (they all accepted the Cirrus network \u2013 not sure if that\u2019s the most common, but that\u2019s what our ATM card was on) Most of the nearby shops and airport take dollars as well as pesos. We had 2 adjoining rooms which had a great view directly over the small beach area. Unfortunately, none of the adjoining rooms have balconies, but the wonderful view and the convenience of the adjoining rooms made up for it. I thought the rooms were spacious and really comfortable. The floors are tile, but they provide nice slippers which I wore most of the time in the room. The place is immaculate. They spend about \u00bd hour each day cleaning each room thoroughly (I was in one room one day while they cleaned the other) and then come back in the evening to turn down the beds and do a quick clean-up (replace towels etc.) Sitting at the pool one day, I saw the glass doors into one of the restaurants get cleaned twice in about a 6 hour period. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. There is a breakfast buffet in the morning with plenty of fruit, Mexican dishes, bread and pastries. You can get made to order eggs, waffles, French toast and pancakes. Lunch is also a buffet with many choices. They had several different things at the grill as well that you could get made to order. Overall, the bread at the meals was probably the only weak menu item \u2013 we just figured it was not a strength in Mexican cooking (and ate other yummy things). One thing that we didn\u2019t learn until later in the week was that there is a nice a-la-carte place at the golf course and spa for lunch. It had great sandwiches and was literally empty the 2 times we ate there. We stumbled onto it after playing golf/having spa treatments one morning and then took the shuttle over there the next day just for lunch. The shuttle runs every 10 minutes or so to the spa. It is probably 2-3 miles away. Dinners were one of my favorite things at the resort. My children really enjoyed how \u201cfancy\u201d everything was and being able to try things they might not try at home. Portions are relatively small, so you could eat an appetizer (or salad or soup), entr\u00e9e and dessert if you were hungry. At night they have 3 a-la-carte restaurants - Asian, Mexican and Italian (no reservations required and no waiting). Once again, the service was just outstanding. Our favorite was by far the Italian restaurant. We ate there 3 nights. Be sure to order Mayan coffee with (or as) your dessert at the Italian restaurant. They make it at your table and it is quite a show. I\u2019m not a coffee drinker, but by the time they put everything and a scoop of ice cream in it (and set it on fire no less), it was quite wonderful. The Mexican restaurant was also really good. The Asian was our least favorite. It wasn\u2019t bad, just not as good as the others \u2013 and didn\u2019t quite compare with our favorite Chinese restaurant at home. They did have ice cream tempura at the Asian restaurant which was one of our favorite desserts. We also had one dinner at Xpu-ha Palace. We all agreed that while it wasn\u2019t bad, the meal at Xpu-ha was just not as good as at \u201chome\u201d. You can also order sandwiches or chips and salsa at the pool or a variety of things from room service (my daughters loved the room service chocolate cake \u2013 it\u2019s small, order one for everyone) My husband and son played golf course one morning and loved it. They had been told it was a brutally hard course. While they thought it was challenging (they are just weekend hackers), they didn\u2019t think it was as hard as everyone made it out to be. My daughters and I visited the spa and loved it. We had a spa credit, but I thought the prices were reasonable, especially for the level of service we received. (for example - 50 minute massage - $119, 80 minute hot stone massage - $184, basic manicure $25, basic pedicure $29, hot stone pedicure $54). The ferry to Cozumel is pretty-much next door to the resort and runs several times a day (walking on the beach is the quickest way there). There are 2 different ferry companies (each with 4 or so times each way), so you are probably better off just buying a one way ticket so that you have the flexibility to go with whichever ferry has the best time coming back for you. Round trip was $22. Once we got there, we walked to Cozumel Palace which was about a 15-20 minute walk (turn right once you get off the ferry and you can\u2019t miss it). We found out a taxi there would have been 60 pesos (~$4.50). They have snorkeling equipment and you can snorkel right off the pier (there is no beach). We took the tour to Tulum which was included as part of the Palace Passport. After picking us up, the bus stopped at Adventura Palace to pick people up and then onto Tulum. Overall, it took about an hour and \u00bd there. Once there, we had 2 hours at the ruins which, due to the heat, was about all you could take. The ruins may not be as impressive as Chichen Itza, but they are a lot closer to the resort and really beautiful in their own right. After leaving the ruins, they do stop at an \u201cauthentic\u201d Mayan shop. It was a quick stop (20ish minutes) and there was no pressure to buy anything, so I didn\u2019t have a problem with it. Last stop is Xpu-ha Palace for lunch and swimming. They bring several busloads to Xpu-ha in the afternoon, so there are a lot of people there. The bus leaves at 4:30 to go back, but we decided to stay for dinner there and took a taxi back to Playacar Palace (200 pesos - ~$15). I believe all of the Palace resorts have a hospitality suite where you can take a shower if you\u2019d like to stay and clean up before dinner (which is what we did). Xpu-ha is very pretty (very different from the other resorts), but everything is very spread apart and the beach is pretty much non-existent, so it was nice for an afternoon/evening, but would not be my first choice for a longer stay. We also took the included trip to the Holkan zip line. My children really wanted to try it and it was a relatively short trip, so we gave it a try (left the resort at 10:00, returning at 1:30). We had a van that took 7 of us directly there \u2013 about a 45 minute drive. It then took about \u00bd hour to get everyone in the other groups there, release forms signed, equipment on, and directions given, before we were ready to go. For the most part the zip-lines are in an open area (as opposed to through a jungle like some of the original zip-line/canopy tours), but the sensation is still fun. There are a total of 12 towers which take 50ish minutes (and by that time, you\u2019re pretty tired anyway). It\u2019s a good bit of driving, but I\u2019d recommend it anyway. There are activities all day long. We all joined in on various activities \u2013 beach/pool volleyball, bartending class, folding towel animals, bingo, black jack and texas hold-em at different points in time. The entertainment staff was excellent \u2013 Super Erick is in a league by himself (which is why he shows up in several of these trip advisor reports). He is hysterical and made even bingo (which I would normally say is boring), pretty funny! Super Erick said he also started in housekeeping which I believed since he could fold a mean towel animal! They have 3 shows during the week. The Fire show is excellent. We also enjoyed both the magician and the circus show \u2013 a juggler, hula-hoop type act and 2 absolutely fantastic guys doing strength/balancing moves (think cirque-du-soleil). If you have children, I\u2019d definitely make a point of seeing both of those. When you make reservations for your tours, they will try to get you to go to a Palace membership presentation at Adventura Palace (maybe 20-30 minutes away). I\u2019m sure if you don\u2019t reserve any of the tours, they probably make a pitch to you some other time. I\u2019d say it was medium pressure (or I was just tired after traveling). I think part of the problem was that we did not decisively say no when they first asked. I have a feeling that probably would have taken care of it, so I\u2019d recommend just being prepared to be decisive! They kept throwing in freebies to entice us to give it a try. The last offer to us was 2 rounds of golf, 4000 pesos (~$300) in spa credit and free taxi there and back. If you decide to do it, make sure they give you at least more than that! They said the presentation was during breakfast at Adventura Palace, but would not tell us how long the presentation was, which pretty much decided it for me. They did call our room later in the week to see if we had decided we were interested. That time however, it was a simple question and when I said no, it wasn\u2019t mentioned again. Now that I have written a short novel, all that I can say is if you have narrowed down your choices and this is one of them, don\u2019t hesitate \u2013 you will absolutely love it here!!!

I cannot say enough about the staff - they are simply wonderful. My favorite part of the day is at sunrise, watching the sun come up over the Carribean as the Cozumel Ferry docks (right next door) and Cozumel in the distance.

If you want to relax by the pool - great - this is the place for you, if you want to visit the the attractions such as Xcaret, Xel Ha or Rio Secreto, then this is also the place as Playacar Palace is centrally located and everything is within easy cab distance or just rent a car.

I normally stay at Ritz Carltons and was expecting a significant drop off. To my surprise and elation, the Playacar Palace was fantastic. Its about 40 mins from the airport and the surrounding areas seem a bit suspect but once you get to the hotel, you realize why this place get such great reviews. The hotel itself is a bit aged but they do a great job with the upkeep and it is spotless. My wife commented when we got to the room that it didnt smell like a hotel room. We had 2 connecting rooms with a beautiful ocean view. It was fine but if i had a do over, i would insist on rooms with balconies. Again, the room was spotless with fully stocked liquor cabinet and mini fridge. TV is a bit limited with english speaking channels but does the job. Wireless internet was perfectly fine and the unlimited long distance phone was a nice touch. The staff at the hotel was great. They were not in your face at all but the minute you needed anything, they were immediately there for you and were accommodating, polite and friendly. The food was my biggest surprise. I was expecting trays of mac and cheese and hamburgers. What we got were a vast array of choices that were not massed produced. Plenty of dishes for kids as well as more adult choices of beef, chicken, salads and lots of \"local\" flavor as well. The pool setup is great, lots of chairs available, a great bar and a small beach. If you are looking to hang at a beach all day, this isnt the place for you however, the pool is just above the beach so you are practically on it anyway without the hassle of sand all over you. The service at the pool is a bit spotty, you are better off getting up and ordering a drink or food from the bar yourself (you'll appreciate the exercise anyway). I cant speak for the tours but the people i was there with all had good things to say about them. We did a swim with the dolphins with my kids which was really nice however, considering the cost (figure $600 for 3 kids when all is said and done), id skip that and wait to do it in the states. Wasnt the most upscale venue but was still the highlight for my kids. The market right outside the hotel was a lot of fun. Everything is negotiable so dont get sucked in. Couple of minor critiques; the diet coke from the fountain was not very good (and probably not diet coke) and the room keys had to be re-programmed at least once a day which was annoying. The hotel is not quite as elegant as a Ritz however, it was clean, i didnt see a bug the entire time and you felt like you were at a 5 star resort. One more thing to mention, this was a company trip and we had events every night at the hotel. The events were top notch, with great food, entertainment and service. We ran a golf tournament at the beautiful golf course run by the hotel, very challenging championship course located at the same site as the spa which my wife said was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who runs incentive trips or business meetings. My salespeople had the time of their lives and i know they appreciated not having a big incidental bill at the end of it.

Yesterday we had a good beach morning at Le Blanc, including sand volleyball, then a lunch on the terrace. At 2pm Palace had a driver shuttle us about an hour and ten minutes south to Playa Del Carmen, and the Playacar Palace. This resort reminds us of Le Blanc, the same designer for the rooms, Italian Restaurant, etc. It is a notch below Le Blanc, the robes are not as plush, you need a towel card to get pool towels, the liquors are not as top notch. It is a lovely resort, just south of 5th Avenida and the touristy area of PDC. Dinner was outside last night, where they did a tasty BBQ. Today we'll take a short shuttle to the Playacar Golf & Spa, and check out the facility. Time for coffee on the terrace. Sunday - Continued: We 'discovered' the Playacar Golf and Spa, another Palace facility only a few minutes ride from Playacar Palace. My DW loves it! A lovely spa, 18 hole course, and small pool. In addition, a really nice looking sit down restaurant for breakfast and lunch. We're going tomorrow morning. We caught the 1:00pm ferry to Cozumel. About a 40 minute trip for $20 round trip per person. We grabbed a cab and had lunch at the Cozumel Palace. Another great facility with Palace. We stayed long enough to see the kickoff of Carnaval activities, and ferried home at 6:00pm. Now some leisurely drinks, and a light dinner. Monday: Monday dawned overcast,but we had a spa morning planned. I used the well equipped small gym at the Playacar Golf & Spa, before using the men's spa facilities. In succession I took a steam, sauna, hot tub, and foot bath massage, intersperced with short, bracing showers. Finally, I used the facilities showers and men's dressing room. My wife had a Total Body Scrub, followed by 'taking the waters' on the ladies side of the facility. We had a wonderful sit down lunch at the small restaurant onsite before returning to the Playacar Palce. In the afternoon we walked 5th Avenue in PDC, shopped, and enjoyed a freshly made hand rolled cigar with a drink. The asian restaurant had good sushi, and some interesting main dishes. We chose a table by the window and watched the fire show staged by the pool from the comfort of the restaurant. Tuesday: Tuesday was again overcast, with a few drops of rain in the am. By noon, mostly sunny and beautiful. I swam at the beach just on the south side of the hotel, nice sand, reasonable surf. The pool is beckoning... Wednesday: Another outside BBQ last night here at the Playacar Palace. Really good ribs, nicely seasoned roasted chicken. We'll try the Italian tonight. Wednesday is beautiful, partly sunny and 84 degrees. The first real glitch here this morning. The spa admin staff screwed up my DW's carefully laid plans, she spent 1/2 hour straightening them out. We both had 50 minute massages, then 'took the waters' in hydrotherapy before another 'country club' at the restaurant at the Playacar Spa & Golf. THis afternoon I had another great swim in the ocean while my DW napped. Service levels, cleanliness, food quality all remain high. Thursday/Friday: Last day at Playacar, mostly sunny, mid - 80's, PERFECT! Started off at the Playacar Golf & Spa - sauna, steam, hot tub, foot massage whirlpool, and a lazy shower. DW had some hydrotherapy and a manicure. After a wonderful 'al fresco' lunch facing the beautiful blue and green ocean, I took a swim off of the beach next to the resort. Followed with a cigar, and the wish to stay forever, or another week if possible. We'll reluctantly pack tonight, for an 11am flight tomorrow back to the 'great white north'.

This was a first trip to Mexico and decided on Playacar after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. Driving into Playa del Carmen I was starting to regret not staying at one of the grand entrance resorts into Puerto Morales but I was quickly relieved when we pulled into the hotel. The hotel was beautiful, contemporary and extraordinarily well maintained. I give strong kudos to the service staff at the resort since they we are quick to respond and follow up. As for the design of the hotel, the hotel reflects a monotone contemporary feel that abandons that gaudy tropical colors of other resorts. The one theme that carries throughout the resort is a contemporary casualness with soothing brownscale colors. The resort offers clean lines with steel, white cement and glass. Very soothing and appealing to us. The oceanfront room was very nice with a large king bed with cushioned backboard, flat screen TV, elegant lighting, wonderful views and a jacuzzi in the room (which we did not use). The room has a liquor dispensor with Cuervo Tequilla, Smirnoff Vodka, Bacardi Rum and a whiskey. The mini bar is stocked with several varieties of soda, apple and orange juice, waters, and Dos Equis and Tecate beer. They also offer a low grade bottle of wine. Maid service was superb and they also offer a turndown service around 8PM with chocolates. The pool was nice with multiple shelfs to place a chair in shallow water or to sit and take in the scene. Service is relatively attentive around the pool area and the unliimited free drinks is a nice feature. IMPORTANT: There is NO beach in front of the resort. You will need to walk next door for a small but suitable beach. So our family was quite impressed with the hotel, room, service, amenities and view. Now the bad part. I truly wish this wasn't an all inclusive because the food was disappointing. After 2-3 days, the food is monotonous, fried and nausea inducing. I don't think it was a problem specifically with the resort but the whole riviera. We did not have one good meal that I would saw wow and that includes are multiple day trips and outings. The food at the resort was so/so and the room service food was quite bad. The shrimp cocktail was unedible as well as many other things we tried. The food was not fresh and all seem to taste the same. I will give them credit for having a decent array of food available at the buffets but everything really tasted the same and cooked in the same old oil. TIP: Men should pack a pair of slacks because the Italian restaurant and the Oriental restaurant require slacks. To end this on a positive note, the location was great. You can walk to the ferry to Cozumel (about 100 meters away), check out Quintada Avenue for dining and shopping and casual strolls. The wildly popular XCaret eco park is about a 10-15 minute drive away. The hotel offers golf and spa services at the nearby Playacar enclave. I would highly recommend going to Xel Ha eco park further south on 307 as opposed to Xcaret.

The staff is to be one of the best of all the resorts we have visited and believe me, this is what makes the trip so enjoyable. They treat you like family and call you by your first names after your first day there and remember what you like to drink and in some cases the food at breakfast, we loved the made to order omelets. Perfect, and the fresh squeezed juices each morning. Although the free tours were included, we opted to just enjoy the pool and shopping on 5th ave. right around the corner,,no need for a taxi... I enjoyed the free phone calls to US from our room, since i had my Dad and grandmother both with health problems, so it was easy to call and check on them daily. We truly enjoyed the buffet dining, not your typical boring foods, but a variety each day... The first night for desert, i enjoyed the homemade ice creams, but the next night i witnessed a family there with three children, who did not care if the children licked from the ice cream scoop, and put it back in the container, then one of the children proceeded to pick up a cone and lick it and then put it back up on the bar with the fresh ones... I almost went to the parents and said something to them, but from the looks of them, their children could no wrong,so i thought it would just cause a big scene. I did however, go the the dining room manager and tell him, and he apologized and watched the children... We went ahead a left, and decided i didn't need the ice cream anyway,, I just hated it for everyone after us that dined and enjoyed their homemade ice cream....Parents,,, please watch your children....they were climbing over everything.... As for the entertainment staff, they were remarkable.. I remember Claudia, she waited on us in the dining room ,and then after a couple of nights, she moved up to the lobby bar... and then helped in the Apollo lounge with Kareoke night, and was great...We had a group of Canadian friends, who made the show and was such a blast...

There was a liquor dispenser in our room , but we never took advantage of it, but the drinks made for us at the bar were great....Mojito was great ....along with a BBC, which is a pina colada with a banana and some baileys in it.....mmmmmm.....We had to try one or two the morning we left and before we had to turn in our all inclusive wrist band.... as we were loading into the van,,,, we heard a \"Maam?? and i turned around and there was our sweet lobby bartender with a tray of two BBC's and he said one more for the road.... i could have cried,,, i didn't want to leave........ We picked a room on the bottom floor,,, 115, and it was perfect......the view of the ocean and the pool and was so handy,, out our door and down around the corner we were at the pool and also the restaurant.....what more could you ask for...... Treat yourself,,, your not promised tomorrow....... I wish i could remember more names, i wrote them down ,and now i can't find my notes,,,,,,,but you won't regret this Palace... oh, one more thing,,, we took the free shuttle over the golf course and ate at the restaurant there and it was wonderful, and one of the best Margaritas i have ever had .....ask for top shelf with a splash of sprite and orange juice......simply the best.........", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cTook a long time to reveiw but great\u201d", "Author": "roamingelf", "ReviewID": "UR23558561", "Content": "It took a long time to write this (2 yrs)................but after looking to book to go back to the Mayan again we wanted to try somewhere different, however after reading countless other reviews of other similar properties in the area, we kept saying why not go back to Playacar.

It was incredible. The location is fantastic , steps away from 5th Avenue. The standard Jacuzzi room we stayed in was more than comfortable (2 double beds) . We hardly every stayed in the room (see activities below). The maids must scour these rooms, they are spotless. No Bugs ...superclean and you get full maid service in the morning and turndown service at night... Excellent. (wet towels removed, garbages emptied, comforters folded and my kids loved the different towel art every night and who could resist the late night chocolate on your bed)!!! The room is fully equipped ...toothbrushes, toothpaste, robes, slippers and amazing salon products..shampoo/conditioners/body creams etc..You even get a shaving kit..awesome for my husband. The food is INCREDIBLE ...The daily buffet restaurant is great all day - breakfast / lunch and dinner....freshly made pancakes, belgian waffles.... fruit and cheese selections..Amazing juices ... Lunch offers many great grill choices...steak , filet mignon, lamb., fish , home made burgers, pizza and the list goes on and on...They make their own ice cream and my kids couldn't get enough. They never complained once about anything they ate!!! We loved the 24 room service...quick service and great selection ... Dinner (3 -4 courses available) was usually at Terrazza the italian restaurant which is beautifully decorated and the food and wine selection is superb. The Asian was good but we preferred the Italian....The pool side snack bar is also good if you don't want to give up the sun to head into the buffet..Most importantly ANYTHING you order will be fresh and taste incredible...The pastries are all made on site and look like they are out of a magazine. Needless to say we all over ate because it all looked so good. The best drink --MOJITOS ...Fresh Mint and Lime ...with or without alcohol. Kids Club and Activity Staff are phenomenal. The kids are entertained all day 10am-4pm and 7-8pm both indoors and outdoors. There are krafts in the kids club daily. It is also equipped with WII or XBOX systems and many games. The kids especially loved the water balloon fights and whip cream fights on the beach. They sometimes skipped dinner to head over to the kids club to join their evening shows and activities which were all great (puppet show, magic show, pinata night etc...) The staff are all great with kids. They even offer private babysitting service after hours. Say Hello to Damarise and Marianna!! PS -They have plent of sand toys and pool toys so no need to pack these for kids..The pool side staff are fun and active and not pushy. They have great activities - water aerobics, water volleyball or water polo and beach soccer . The nightly shows and activities were INCREDIBLE and PROFESSIONAL put on by talented outside peformers. Don't miss the Circus Show (similar to Circue Du Soleil), Fire Show, and Mexican Show...all were good and we enjoyed every one of them . Activities like Casino Night, Poker Night , Bingo and Karoake followed each show. We took in all of these activities with our kids and they were wiped out by the end of the night. This Hotel goes out of its way to keep their guests entertained. THERE IS A SMALL SANDY BEACH that fronts this hotel but the hotel does not provide loung chairs or bar service . A few times I had a lounge chair brought down to the beach to keep an eye on my kids while they built sandcastles. There is room for a few lounge chairs but you'll have to carry them down yourself and return them when you are done..The staff seemed ok with it. The pool is great 3 feet all across (kid safe)...heated and large . One side of it is a children's (toddler) pool which tends to be cooler. This resort is affiliated with many other palace properties that I was told are much larger . This one was small and intimate . It is perfect for families with young children and there are many. I would not recommend this hotel for singles as some said it was too quiet. This vacation exceeded all of our expectations. The staff are all incredible and go out of their way in providing the best possible service. Although Tips are included the maid and waiters I was told are paid the least and rely on them.

They knew exactly what type of juice we drink in the morning and they would serve it even before we ask for it; that\u2019s how personalized the service is. I totally recommend both the Italian and Japanese restaurants for dinner. They both offer excellent menus and the staff can\u2019t make enough to accommodate any request you may have. If you go to the Asian restaurant, make sure to ask for Josue, the best waiter EVER, he is officially our \u201camigo\u201d now, everyone is just ready to help you in whatever you may need. On top of all that, you also get room service 24 hours! Our wedding coordinator Dulce was excellent, I didn\u2019t have to do anything just had to show up, and be ready to have a great time. She took care of everything else always with a smile on her face. We have the best memories ever. The entertainment staff was awesome, very friendly and always trying to keep the crowd going, but nothing out of control, you decide if you want to participate or not. Our group love to do different things, so we did enjoy everything from karaoke night to salsa classes. The rooms are super clean and every room has a jacuzzi tub. The spa is fabulous too; it's 5 mins away from the Hotel. All the tours are also included, I highly recommend Chichen Itza and Tulum, amazing beach! The beach at the hotel is not big, but it\u2019s enough to enjoy. Beautiful turquoise water.

This hotel is not the massive multi-building, 2,000+ room type place. It has less than 300 rooms and since we were visiting prior to high season, it was probably half caacity. We never had to wait for a table, or cocktail, or lounge chair. The rooms are big enough for 2, or maybe 4 if two are younger and if modesty is not an issue. In-room beverages, beer and cocktails always replenished, and they'll change items out if you like. The pool arae has a decent swim-up bar, as well as servers who'll bring drinks. About 4 or so, most of the pool is shaded. It is still comfortable. The only regret is there is no hot tub in the pool area. There were some children there, but they were well mannered. The breakfast is enjoyable and varied, with odd-named juices to try each day. Vampire juice made with beets and other veggies/fruits was the carziest! Lunch is buffet (same restaurant as breakfast), or poolside (burgers, fries etc). What we missed was the a la carte lunch at the restaurant at the spa/golf clubhouse, which is a 5 minute shuttle (free) from the lobby. The Spa (we think) has a gender-separate whirlpool and sauna/steam, as well as a full service spa. The Couples Romantic Massage was enjoyable, but for $260 USD, we could have had 4 or 5 massages on the north side of the Marina (to Cozumel), where a man has 2 tables and canopies to shield you from the mid-day sun. I was told a one-hour massage was $25. Speaking of that area, you can go there to soak up sun after the pool area gets shady. 5 minute walk. The guys will try to sell you everything. One guy said he would take \"less advantage of us\" than the others. He used more common parlance. The hotel has great vacation planners who assist you with tours and spa/golf services. A daily shuttle to Moon Palace is provided. Adventura Spa is about 15 minutes and you'd need a taxi. Nearby areas to consider: Tulum, Xpa-Ha, Cozumel (and Cozumel Palace) and the broad array of shops within walking distance of the resort. The Ferry leaves at different times each day and costs about $24 USD per person round trip. We are sure to return, and we usually prefer to explore \"new\" places before a return visit, so that says a great deal. There are some nightly activities and the fire show is one that you should get seated for early, you'll have seats and you'll have a good view.

It was our fifth trip to a Palace Resort and our second at this property. As my title states Palace Resorts is #1 in my book. We arrived about 11:30 am on the 20th and check-in was a breeze. The front desk staff is professional and courteous and friendly. We were given our champagne and my son a soda immediately. Even though we arrived at an early hour, our room was ready and we were taken straight up with our bags coming within 15 minutes. We had room 416 which had 2 double beds, hot tub and balcony with table and chairs. Views of both the pool and the ocean/beach. Room was extremely clean and well maintained. Liked the robes and slippers and loved the alcohol cabinet and mini fridge. We spent much of our time at the pool. It is not a super-sized pool but plenty big enough for the size of the resort. The water was a comfortable temperature. The bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly and gave excellent service. Had the absolute best cheeseburgers sitting at the pool bar. We never had a problem finding a chair no matter what time of day we showed up. The recreation staff were fun and lively and got a lot of people to join in the games and activities. I am usually a sit around and relax person on vacation but they were able to get me up and playing volleyball and that is a huge accomplishment. My son wanted to do the kids club again and I was worried that he would be bored now that he is 10. But we let him give it a try and he still had a blast. He loves the video games and he made friends that he was able to play with/hang around with when the kids club closed for lunch or the day. The beach is very small. Even smaller than the last time we were there but there are lounges out there if you want to sit on the beach. The ocean water was very clean and crystal clear, very warm and very calm. The food was good as I expected it to be. My only disappointment is that the Mexican restaurant goes from buffet from breakfast and lunch to a menu for dinner. We much preferred the buffet and only ate there for dinner one night. The Italian restaurant was good, a little different than the Italian at home but good nonetheless. I would highly recommend the parmesan soup and lasagna. The Asian restaurant was excellent and we ate there most nights. We tried lots of different things and nothing was bad. Again, the staff in all the restaurants was friendly and helpful. I just can't say enough about the employees of these resorts. Every one of them is fantastic. Professional, courteous, friendly, helpful, wonderful. If you go make sure to look for - Jorge (pool bar); Demaris (kids club), Sergio, Ana and Yazmin (recreation), Alfierto, Luis and Virgilio (lobby bar).

When we arrived the check -in was very pleasant and quick with a welcome drink. We were immediately shown to our room and it was very nice with a lovely balcony and view. The GOOD: Everyone at the hotel was very nice and the service was excellent. Everyone was very polite and tried to help you in every way they could. The room was cleaned every day and the refrigerator was always fully stocked with beer, soft drinks, and water. The waiters out by the pool were very nice and we hardly ever had to get up out of our seats to get a drink and they will also bring you food like burgers and fries from the pool bar. The buffet waiters were very polite and attentive but our favorite by far was Elisio. He always had a big smile on his face and kind words to share. The BAD: The entertainment is really non-existent. The entertainment crew by the pool seem to be struggling to come up with things to do. For example: One day they brought a worn out copy of \"The Godfather\" around and ask everyone to guess how many pages the book had. Whoever came the closest, won the book. Wow, that was exciting. I thought that they were the least friendly of anyone at the resort and they didn't really seem to be enjoying what they were doing. One day they did a trivia game and one of the questions was to write down \"their \" names ( the entertainment staff). That was kind of hard since they never bothered to introduce themselves to us. And we were at the pool every day. Another pool activity was a fashion show of the things that they sold in their hotel gift shop. Some woman with a very annoying voice saying everything in English and then Spanish on a microphone went on forever. I thought it would never end. The lounges were very sterile looking and like someone else said, they look kind of like hospital waiting rooms with no personality. We would walk by them at night and there would only be about three or four people in there. And now for the shows, we only went to one and the room that they performed in was horrible. They had a small portable looking stage and the room was ugly with straight chairs lined up in straight rows. Yes, we are comparing this to the Iberostar Tucan which we have been to twice. They had a lovely outdoor space for shows with tables and chairs. They had wonderful lively shows and encouraged audience participation unlike the Playacar Palace. The Playacar Palace needs to \"lighten up\" a little if you ask me. They especially need some serious re-decorating of their public spaces like the lounges and restaurants. Everything is very sterile and bland. We walked into town every night because the hotel was so boring and there was nothing to do there.

It was a first time to Playa and we loved it and we loved Playacar Palace! We can't wait to go back to Playa again. Location: The location was excellent. We rode the ADO bus from the Cancun airport (only $8 per person!) and walked to the hotel. The hotel was only about 3-4 blocks from the bus station. It is located on the South end of Quinta. It is really convenient to be able to walk into town whenever you want. Hotel & common areas: The lobby and most of the hallways are open air, which we thought was lovely. There is a lobby bar and the aqua bar. All the decorating was very modern and classy. Everything was always impeccably clean. The hotel is not huge, which was nice. It wasn\u2019t a far walk to get anywhere. Overall Service: When we arrived we were immediately greeted and checked in and everything was explained to us. A bellhop took us to our room and gave us a tour and explained everything. For the most part everyone working at the hotel was very friendly. The next day we went to sign up for some of the free tours and honeymoon dinner. The woman asked if we wanted to go to Aventura Spa Palace for a tour (& a timeshare presentation) and we would get $100 spa credit. We said no thanks and we were never asked about any timeshare stuff again. The service in the restaurants varied some. The servers were all friendly and most were very good. On a few occasions, the service was very slow. Room: We had a Honeymoon Suite (143) and it was awesome! At first I was worried because it was the first floor, but when we got to our room we loved it! Even though it was the first floor we still had a balcony, and it was directly over the ocean, and the pool and all the restaurants were right around the corner. The jacuzzi in the room was wonderful. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The AC worked great. Basically, everything about the room was fantastic. The only small thing we thought was a little weird was that there is no door on the shower and no matter how we tried to direct the spray of the showerhead it ended up getting water all over the bathroom floor. No big deal-we had plenty of towels and we just threw a few on the floor, but it was a little funny. Pool/Beach: We LOVED the pool and beach! There was a beach-the first few days it was pretty small, but towards the end of the week they brought chairs down to the sand. I really could care less if there was a beach though because I don\u2019t like getting all sandy. I just loved the ocean! We live in Southern CA, but I have not gotten in the ocean here in 5 years-it is cold and dirty. In Playa we pretty much started off every day getting in the ocean and playing in the waves. Then we would rinse off and lay out, get in the pool, have a few drinks, etc. The pool water was perfect. I am a baby about jumping into cold pools. It was a perfect temperature, warm, but refreshing. The Miami Vice was a great drink (pina colada and strawberry daiquiri mixed)! Housekeeping: The maid did a great job. She went so far as straightening our shoes and putting any toiletries left out in a neat row. Everything was cleaned very well. They also came twice a day which we didn\u2019t realize until we were there for a few days and we came back from dinner and found our towels neatly hung and comforter folded. We didn\u2019t get any \u201ctowel art\u201d like I hear some people get, but we didn\u2019t care about that-only thought about it because I had heard about it. The first two days no one came to restock our minibar, which was kind of weird. There are two fridges in the Honeymoon Suite, so we still had drinks, but by the end of the second day we were out of the drinks that we liked. We called and asked that they send someone to restock it. We left a tip and a note asking for the soda and beer we liked, and the next time we came back to our room our fridges were fully stocked with exactly what we asked for. Later that day someone called and asked us if our minifridge had been being stocked and we told them it hadn\u2019t been for two days, but it was after we called. It seemed like there was some sort of mixup. We didn\u2019t have any problem after that. Not sure what the problem was with that, but no big deal. Also, we left our laptop computer out in our room for our whole trip and had no problem and the wireless internet worked great. Restaurants/Food: The hostesses at the restaurant were all very sweet. We thought the food in the Asian and Italian restaurant was really good. We had the lasagna and some fettucine alfredo type dish at the italina place. At the Asian place we loved the chow mein and I liked the sushi rolls. The tempura ice cream was also super yummy! The service was excellent all but one night. On the last night there seemed to be some issue at the Asian restaurant and our service was not very good. We also had the Honeymoon dinner and it was excellent. We had the filet and fish and both were very good. The breakfast buffet was great, especially the french toast and made to order omelets. We actually never ate at the lunch buffet. We always either got something at the pool or we were out on an excursion. The cheeseburgers by the pool were great. We tried one other thing from the pool menu (some crab salad sandwich thing) and it wasn\u2019t too great. The dinner buffet was fine. We ate there a couple times because the first night we were really hungry and the other time we were in a hurry. Obviously it is quick since the food is all ready. The food was fine. We always found plenty to eat. Nothing was great, but nothing was bad either. The room service menu was a little more limited than we expected. We tried a cheeseburger a couple times. For some reason the ones at the pool were better. We had a club sandwich and it was good. The chicken broth was good. One time when we called and ordered and they called us back a few minutes later and asked us if we wanted cheesecake too. We said sure, why not, and it was really good. Tours: We went on the Paradise Snorkeling Tour and the Tulum/Xpu-Ha tour. The snorkeling tour was great. We went to Maroma Beach (which was lovely) and then went out on a boat to the reef. We saw lots of fish. It was great. After snorkeling, you could pay extra to do activities like horseback riding, wave runners, etc. or just hang out. We just laid out, played in the ocean, etc. They also had free buffet lunch and drinks. The food was ok. Tulum was absolutely amazing-One of our favorite things. The tour guide was great-extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We did end up breaking off from the tour a little early. It was boiling hot and we couldn\u2019t resist going down to the ocean. It was the best-Absolutely beautiful water and great waves to play in. The only annoying thing was that after Tulum and on our way to Xpu-Ha we stopped at this Mayan marketplace and that took too long. It was cool to see Xpu-Ha. It is a huge Palace resort. They have monkeys, flamingos, crocodiles, and other animals. We hung out at the pool there for a bit and also had a free buffet lunch-it was pretty good. Other Excursions: After Tulum/Xpu-ha we actually did not go back to the hotel with the tour. We took a taxi to Akumal and snorkeled at Yal-Ku. It was fantastic. It is like a lake with very clear salt water and tropical fish. We only had about 45 minutes there because it closes at 5:30 and we definitely wish we had more time. We also took the ferry over to Cozumel Palace and hung out there for the day. Overall we didn\u2019t like Cozumel that much. We only walked through town to the hotel, but it seemed much more touristy than Cozumel-I swear a hundred people asked us if we wanted to rent a scooter or go snorkeling. Cozumel Palace seemed more lively overall than Playacar Palace. We liked it, but overall we still liked Playacar Palace better. A cool thing about Cozumel Palace was that you can climb down a ladder right into the ocean and snorkel. We saw a good amount of good fish. It was cool. We also got massages at Veronica\u2019s and they were great! Nightlife: We are in our late 20s and we like to party. Playacar Palace is pretty quiet at night. We were pretty surprised that the Lobby bar was often basically empty. We only saw two of the evening performances. The fire dancers were amazing and the capoeira performance was also great. We usually had a few drinks at the hotel and then walked into town. We went to Senor Frogs once (right by the hotel). It was the regular Spring Break atmosphere, but fun. We also went to Bali Club, Santanera, Blue Parrot, and Coco Maya. They were all cool. Bali Club was a total dance club, Santanera had a great upstairs outdoor patio, Blue Parrot was fun-dancing and the awesome fire show, Coco Maya is right next to Blue Parrot and has dancing and hanging out areas. We had fun at all of them, but I think Coco Maya was our favorite.", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Family Vacation\u201d", "Author": "pcblaw", "ReviewID": "UR18018095", "Content": "Together with my husband and 3 kids (5,7,9) and 9 other family members, we spent a wonderful week at the Playacar Palace. We arrived 7/5 and returned 7/12/08. The location cannot be beat, close to Xel-Ha, Xcaret, Tulum and others. When we booked the Playacar Palace we were concerned about the lack of a sandy beach. According to resort personnel, 3-4 months ago this palace had water up to it's breakwater wall. However, we were greeted by a wonderful large white sand beach and clean swimmable water. Each morning the staff place several lounge chairs and umbrellas on the beach and bar service is provided by the wonderful staff. The pool is immediately adjacent to the pool and provides the best of both sea and fresh water swimming. We loved the beautiful room and balcony overlooking the water. The best rooms are on 2nd floor (with direct connection to lobby), although other rooms on floors above have nice balconies as well. One of our group was upset to find themselves in a 1st floor room with no balcony (some rooms have only windows) and no view. They were moved the next day to the 5th (top floor). We loved the buffet, especially the wide array of fresh hot items and wonderful pastries. The kids ate as much of the homemade ice cream as they could hold. Also we had a great experience in the Italian and Asian restaurants. The Italian restaurant menu changes every few days so go more than once. The Asian restaurant sushi and tempura are fantastic. We were travelling on the all inclusive package which included tours. The Paradise Island Snorkeling trip was a waste, apparently many areas of Cancun are overrun with seagrass and there was virtually nothing to see, the food was poor, and the boat trip was about 10 minutes long. The Tulum tour was very boring, the guide (Santiago) insisted on teaching history of mexico instead of providing information relevant to Tulum. However this tour was saved by the lunch and swimming at Xpu-Ha (Esh-pu-ha) Palace which has a great kids pool area and huge pool with great service and few guests. We took the lobby to lobby shuttle to the Moon Palace for a day and thought we had accidentally gone to Las Vegas. The Moon Palace is enormous the kids loved the kids pool area, but the beach is unswimmable due to sea grass and the wait staff and service were horrible. Members of our group enjoyed Chichen Itza (Chicken Pizza) but it was a very long slow day, and they insist on taking you to a company run shopping area with hugely inflated prices. Do not miss the palace gift shop, and jewelry shop. After shopping the 5th avenue area extensively, we found the prices and quality to be better at the resort. Do not miss Activity Director (Romaine) or the nightly shows, fire show, mexican show or circus show they are very high quality and quite entertaining. Our favorite wait staff, Wilbert (swim up bar), and Damian (buffet). If you are travelling to Cancun on a Saturday afternoon, be advised that there is usually a huge wait (2 plus hours) to clear customs/immigration into Mexico.", "Date": "July 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "TN", "Title": "\u201cExceptionally friendly\u201d", "Author": "Tnhawkeye", "ReviewID": "UR17385218", "Content": "We just returned from the Playacar Palace in Playa Del Carmen.

We do not have children and had no complaints of being surrrounded by kids, although they we present.

We boarded the hourly ferry from Cozumel to Playa (which can get a lil choppy when the winds turn so hope you have your sea legs) Once you land in Playa Playacar Palace is a short 3min walk from the pier. The entrance /lobby is open air and welcoming. Watch for rain the lobby can get a lil wet , but other wise great views of the ocen and lounge areas for reading etc.. Lobby Bar: Great floor to ceiling sliding glass windows that open to add to the open air feeling. This is also the serving area for the am/pm snacks (superb). Bar stays open and the barkeep is always smiling (kids orders smoothies w/out a problem) Luna Lounge: Only open in the pm, but a nice palce to get your MTV Cool Out vibe on...chic and hip.. Food: Main Buffet dining room is nice for buffet fresh food, but the menu is static. Terreza dining is formal and visually stunning all glass with 40 ft ceiling. Outdoor grill is adjacent to the swim up bar and there is service with a smile. Overall food quality is good. Rooms: the resort is smallish and most of the rooms have reat views of the ocean, hope you like sleek minimalistic furniture (I do) so white on white with flat screens is what you get Pool: A bit of a walk to get to hence it's location but it has great views of the ocean and access to Buffet dining room and 2 beach entry steps with showers and foot pools to wash sand from your feet Kids club: Kids did not like too much only one person staffed and not much to do if you are over 4-5 yrs old. Although the young lady was very nice the kids were bored.(found out that they do have an XBOX 360 that shares duty with an upstairs area, so video games are avail) There is a giant chess set All in all very stylish, very clean and nice.

The Mexican was a' la carte when we first arrived, however it changed to buffet after a few days (I can only assume this was because the hotel had a low occupancy for those few days). There was so much choice on the buffet and everything tasted so good. Expect to put on some weight the portions are huge and you'll want to try everything on the buffet. The staff were so friendly and made our stay extra special by remembering our names (what a lovely touch).

My only slight criticism was that occasionally the music was a little load around the pool area if you just wanted to relax. The beach was small but the sea was lovely. The hotel was about a 5 minute walk from 5th avenue and the Ferry to Cozumel so there is plenty to do. During our stay we caught the ferry to Cozumel and visited the Cozumel Palace.

We're Palace Premier members and had spent one night at their new Isla Mujeres Palace and moved out due to excessive noise (see my and other reviews of the Isla Mujeres Palace on this website). We asked if we could move to another Palace resort and decided to put the Playacar Palace as our first choice since we had stayed in Playa del Carmen three times before and after the disappointment at the Isla Mujeres Palace, wanted to go somewhere more familiar that we know we would like. This is a very nice hotel; we thought the food and service were great, but can only give it an above average rating since we love to lay on the beach under a palapa and there is more of a sea wall to the water than beach. Also, it is directly on the edge of downtown Playa del Carmen with Senior Frogs and the Cozumel Ferry right next door. Would have preferred to have that stuff a bit further from our hotel and view. Overall, this is a very nice place to stay. The staff is wonderful; it's very convenient to the famous \"5th Avenue\" and to the ferry if you want to go to Cozumel. Another great thing is that since it is relatively small, we never had to wait to get a drink or a table in the restaurants and you did not have to make a reservation for the dinner restaurants. Check In: Went smooth but then were transferred over to \"guest services.\" The guest services woman was obviously more interested in getting us to sign up for a \"review\" of our Palace Premier membership at the Aventura Spa Palace than she was in explaining the hotel facilities and available trips. We did sign up for going to the Aventura Spa Palace for the next day because, though huge, is a really beautiful resort, we got a paid round trip taxi, and were given $400 in spa money, and wrap, a tee shirt and a beach bag for going. Room: We were given room 139 which was beautiful. It faced the pool and the sea with a small balcony. Had a small bathroom area and only one sink (usually they have two in Palace Resort rooms). The room was very clean, everything in it worked, well stocked fridge and bar (vodka, rum, tequila and whiskey), nicely furnished. Very comfortable bed...not a mattress on a cement slab like you get at some Mexico hotels...even in decent resorts. Only negative was we were right next to the outside bar and two nights folks partied out there a bit late. Maid(s) did a great job and a couple of times made \"towel animals\" that were really cool. Overall, very happy with room. Pool: I thought it was a bit small and wasn't very deep. Not really good for trying to get some \"laps\" in. More for wading or sport activities like volley ball or water stretching (which we did). Disappointed that with the exception of at low tide a small patch of sand on the north end of the waterfront, no beach. Don't like going off a sea wall into the water that is right next to the ferry pier. Food: Three restaurants, Mexican (which was also the breakfast and lunch buffet), and Italian and an Asian (which we never tried). Our favorite was the Mexican...hey, we're in Mexico. Also, in the Luna bar, they had really fantastic appetizers. They were small so they recommend (as do I) that you order two or three at least. The satay chicken and the crab balls were the best. Breakfast/Lunch: I thought the variety, quality and presentation was excellent. The waiters are extremely attentive and always say, \"It\u2019s a pleasure\" when you thank them. Very highly impressed with and enjoyed the wait staff. Luna Bar: I think we went there every night before dinner. Wonderful staff there. Make sure you order the appetizers here. They are fresh made and are excellent. Italian Restaurant: We ate there twice and really enjoyed it. The staff/service was very nice. Only think a bit goofy is that along one wall there is a long couch thing that I got stuck on twice. You sink in so deeply, it's a bit uncomfortable. They should get rid of that and put in regular chairs. Quality of the food was good. Cool looking three story wine vault. Good wine. Our favorite was a merlot/cabernet blend from Argentina. Mexican Restaurant: The breakfast/lunch buffet restaurant is Mexican restaurant for dinner with menus and wait staff. It was really good. The Aztec Beef was super. We ate there four of six nights. The service is excellent. Try a Mexican Coffee at the end of your meal. It\u2019s quite a show as the waiter rolls out a cart with the coffee, tequila, and other ingredients. Fire and the pouring of flaming liquids is involved. It\u2019s pretty work-intensive so give the waiter a good tip if you get this. (You don\u2019t have to tip but we generally left a dollar or two on the table after breakfast and lunch and five at dinner. Gave the guy a ten for risking self-immobilization for my entertainment.) My wife celebrated her birthday while we were there and we had her birthday dinner in the Mexican restaurant. Arranged with them to make a birthday cake. I have to say it was perhaps the best cake I ever tasted. Was a sort of cheese cake with whipped cream frosting and chocolate slivers all over it. Beautifully presented and delicious. The staff all came to the table with the cake, sang \u201chappy birthday\u201d and then all hugged my wife. Great night and couldn\u2019t have asked for a nicer birthday dinner. Shows: We only saw one, a Brazilian drum beating /martial arts thing that was actually pretty good. The ladies love it due to all the guys in this act being hard bodied hunks. Spa/Golf/Gym/Secret Pool/Club House: The spa is at the golf course which is about a mile away. There is a shuttle van that goes back and forth all day (something like every 15 minutes). We checked it out on the Monday after coming back with our $400 in spa cash for going through the Premier Palace \"upgrade\" presentation at the Aventura Spa Palace. The spa is very nice. Expensive, but we had the \"spa money\". We booked massages, manicures and pedicures for the Friday (our last day) and it was all good. It is very serene in the spa with \u201cnew age\u201d music, aroma therapy, and candles. In both the men\u2019s and woman\u2019s locker rooms (wife vouched for the woman\u2019s locker room) is an elaborate \u201chydra therapy\u201d set up with sauna, stem room, Jacuzzi, cold immersion bath, and foot/leg soaking bath. An attendant is on hand to make sure you don\u2019t pass out and die in the sauna or steam room and gives you drinks and towels. I very highly recommend doing this a time or two, especially in conjunction with the spa treatments. The spa is housed in the facility that is also home to the gym, the golf sign up place and extensive golf store. The gym is small but has good/new aerobic equipment and some weight machines and dumbbells. Not much there but all in good shape. I worked out there one day and for the 90 minutes there was the only person using the facility. Sweet! Cranked up the \u201cclassic rock\u201d on their satellite tvs and had a good time. Just behind this facility is the starters shack for the golf course (Golf is $190.00 a person for 18 holes. Looks to be an absolutely wonderful course but seemed pricey, to say the least.) Also behind the spa building is a nice pool that no one uses and a restaurant that is part of the Palace enterprise and where you can eat if you\u2019re doing the all inclusive. If you want a quiet few hours to read and have a very nice pool to yourself, recommend using this pool. There are lounge chairs there and right behind the pool is the restaurant. The restaurant has a limited menu and closes at 6:00 p.m.ish but was very nice, had excellent salads and sandwiches, and a nice bar. We had drinks and nachos there one afternoon and then lunch on our \u201cspa\u201d day. Very good and great service. Since it was off season, I think the guys were happy to have some work to do. Other: The hotel provides a free shuttle, daily, at 11:00 a.m. to the Moon Palace. So, if you want a nice day on the beach, you can do this. Takes about an hour to get there and leaves at 5:00 p.m. Had a nice day at the Moon Palace. Bottom Line: Great place to stay if you don\u2019t mind not having an on-site beach.

We booked through RCI, had no problems. We chose this location to be outside of the hustle and bustle of big Cancun but still close, to be close to the town of Playa del Carmen which we heard good things about, and this resort seemed to be close to a lot of things we wanted to see. Let me just say, Moon Palace is HUGE, as is Aventura Spa Palace which we visited for a day. We did also like that when you stay with Palace you get to use any of their other facilities including the all-inclusive food/drink anytime. We visited both Aventura (huge) and Cozumel Palaces. We basically just hung by the pool both places cause hey, thats our thang :) We always looked forward to getting back to our \"little Palace\". The hotel itself is beautiful. It sits basically on the cusp of town, tucked away, no big gateway or entrance. But once you step into the lobby you feel it. The Palace-ness of it. Service was always excellent, our room, we thought, fabulous. Now I know from reading lots of reviews here that people like to complain about the smallest of things. I may mention those things from time to time in a review but it would be much more than something small to make me rate a place lower because of it. For us, our room was great because it was big, because it was away from the pool, (as away as you can get at this small resort), although it was likely the longest walk to a room in the place, it WASN'T FAR ! We had room 200 which had a huge balcony, view of the ferry pier which was never intrusive, ocean view - it was beautiful. We were at the end of a hallway which we never saw anyone else walking down so it wasn't heavily traveled or occupied. We liked it. A couple days into our stay we were asked to fill out comment cards. We did, and mentioned the couple very minor little things we noticed like our flat screen TV for the wall missing, we had instead a table top model. Also I had a hard time understanding the room service guy on the phone at times so I mentioned it. They called our room the next day to make sure we were ok, thank us for the comments, they put up our correct TV and made sure I had no further problems with the phone. It was very nice. We made friends with the wait staff we would see daily, another reason I like smaller resorts, and they got to know us as well. Especially our waitresses in the Luna Lounge Claudia and \"Shakira\"(we could never say her name, my husband started the Shakira thing *s*) It was very very close to the start of the 5th avenue downtown area which, for us, was \"eh\" ok, but we aren't big shoppers as much and they do HOUND you as you walk. We ate downtown one night (the resort food is paid for) and it was alright. Just alright. Los Rancheros. For myself I would stay on the main street of 5th and if things cost 5% more in the nicer bigger stores than the little sweaty, hot stores, so be it. We spent one day taking the ferry to Cozumel to the palace there. It was much hotter over there, everyone told us it was a short walk but we did hoof it a ways and took a cab back to the ferry, worth the 5$. It was HOT, did I mention ? Cozumel palace is also small but NO beach, does have good snorkeling right off the pool, but we just didn't enjoy the same ambiance as our little Playacar. We left fairly early and went back to Playacar. We also took a day trip to Aventura Spa Palace, a huge resort down the road a ways, which is adults only. Sounds almost naughty but its really just a nice way to say-NO KIDS ! That part was nice, and once we found the south pool and settled in, we loved it there. More activity and people by the pool, nice lagoon for kayaking or snorkeling but, again, NO BEACH. We did spend the entire day there but headed back for dinner. Not too hot there, nice breeze. There was always a breeze at Playacar, not always everywhere else which was nice, never got too hot even in the sun by the pool. Ok, so , The FOOD. Is it 4 star dining ? No. They do make the attempt to present it as such, service and presentation always nice, but food was good, not great. But thats FINE ! You can have as much as you like, order something else if you don't like it, and it IS good. Just not WOW but thats ok by us ! The DRINKS. Ya, they must water down the booze, everyone assumes so, so if you want to be sure, order wine. But its all you can drink so make it a double or order 2 at a time if its that big a deal ! I love the Bloody Marys in Mexico -- who knew that would be one of their specialties but its my fav and they make 'em GOoooooood ! They use lime juice (never did see a yellow \"lemon\" the whole time in Mexico, EVER) and a sauce called Juga I bought as soon as I got home so I can make me some Mexican Marys and feel like its vacation again ! Oh ya, also a good tip on the alcohol, always ask for the BRAND NAME booze you want or you will get some well brand you have never heard of.....I always specified Absolute Bloody Mary or Bacardi Pina Colada...it makes a difference !! And they DO have the good stuff...make em use it ! They made sure to acknowledge my husbands birthday with a card and cake, which was nice. Room always cleaned promptly, grounds immaculate.

The beach is small, but the pool is nice- my only complaint is concerning the loud 'activities' - the staff does a great job providing entertainment, but it you just want to relax and listen to the surf you don't have that option.

I selected this hotel after reviewing many comments from Travel Advisor. I wanted a smaller hotel that would give my teens freedom to roam without getting lost, all inclusive so I wouldn't have to play tour guide the entire trip, close proximity to town. This hotel gave us all of this and more! The food - There are 3 restaurants at the hotel. Mexican, Italian, and Japanese / Chinese. There was enough variety to keep us coming back for our 8 night stay! The Sushi in the Chinese restaurant was wonderful! The Mexican Cuisine was great. Had a great variety! The fresh fruit was outstanding! The Italian restaurant was wonderful! My son had the lasagne and could have had it several times during our stay! The food choices were great! There are also a couple of lounges that are fun for adults and kids! The Luna Lounge is a great place for kids and adults and has wonderful appetizers! The Service - impeccable! The staff at this hotel is so kind and so accomodating! The restaurants, the room service, the bar service, the best! Jorge Poot a waiter in the Mexican Restaurant is one of the kindest human beings we have met! He is a 5 star person, not to mention his excellent service he provided us during our stay!!!! The cleaning staff did an excellent job! Our room always looked and felt so clean! These wonderful people work very hard! We always left a tip after dining. The Accomodations - We had room 208 on the second floor. We could open our sliding glass door and listen to the ocean! Our view was spectacular! We had one room which was spacious. Our refrigerator was stocked every day with beer, pop, soda. We had 2 queen beds. The pool was fun and a great staff outside. Willing to get you anything you wanted to drink! We always tipped a $1. This hotel is exactly what we wanted. It has 400 or so rooms which gave me the piece of mind to let the kids wander and yet able to keep my eye on them! The location - We were right on the ocean, a wonderful pool, and 5th avenue (the shopping district) a few steps from the hotel! You can have any and all of the shopping you desire. For those of you who are hopeless Starbuck coffee drinkers, such as I, the mexican coffee was a good match!! However, there is a starbucks in the shopping district about 3 blocks away!! We will certainly visit here again!!! Extra's - We took the Coba excursion which we thought was great! However, when the bus tour guides tell you to buy at the first stop, don't do it! The prices are really high!!!! Shop after you have taken the tour at Coba. The vendors outside the ruins have better pricing. Some of them take CC, but charge you additional for them. Make sure you bargain with cash or credit up front. Example: My daughter wanted a stone turtle, at the first stop the turtle was $20 and my daughter bargained them down to $15.00. However, at the site, the same exact turtle was $8.00 with no bargaining! We gladly paid the $8.00! We took the Paradise Sail Excursion also! This was really a great time. The beach is what you dream about! The light blue sky and the white sand beach with colorful boats in the water! We went snorkeling and it was fantastic. We didn't see a lot, but what we saw was great! My 10 year old was struggling snorkeling and one of the crew took her from me and was with her the entire time! He showed her fish, let her dive with him, she really had a great time and felt very comfortable. His name was Aquaman (real name Reheem)!!!! Wonderful time! After the snorkel you have a couple of hours. We spend ours with Parasailing, which was about $68.00 per person! I think this was the best set up I saw anywhere!! Very safe! I also had a 30 minute massage! It was a wonderful place to have a massage, in an open upstairs cabana. I won't say it was the best massage I have had, but the location and the breeze with the sound of the ocean, was unbelivable! The additional excursions we took were not through the hotel. Discovery Jungle - ATV's and Zip Line!!! What a kick! We rode ATV's for about 40 minutes, unloaded and trekked through the jungle and rode 3 seperate zip lines! We had so much fun and the staff was wonderful!!! They were fun and did a great job of leading us around! The Cenote at the end of the rides was so awesome!!! The cool water and the cave surroundings, unexplainable!!! The other execursion we took was Delphinus!! The kids got to swim with the Dolphins for 50 minutes! In my research on this, we found that the hotel also offers one, but it is about 12 people to one dolphin and it only about 30 to 40 minutes. So you might not get to do anything but touch the dolphin. With Delphinus they were able to touch the dolphin, give them instructions, and do the foot push!! The was cool! The Dolphins come from behind and put their nose on their feet and take them through the water, which makes them come up out of the water, like the are walking on it. Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel and it's staff! I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking to relax, have fun, get a tan, shop, etc. Also, this is an easy hotel to book online as well. If you want the extra execursions included, make sure you include the Gold Pasport to your reservation!", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPoor Experience\u201d", "Author": "mnblues", "ReviewID": "UR15050396", "Content": "We were booked into the Cozumel Palace. When we arrived there they didn\u2019t have our reservation. After nearly 3 hours of waiting they said they could put us up at the Playacar Palace in Playa de Carmen since they were full there in Cozumel. Of course they blamed the travel agency who booked it and the agency blamed the hotel for messing up the booking so we, the traveler, were left in the lurch with little help from either of the above. The hotel never offered anything to make this right for us other than saying they were full. We finally asked for some help here since we were booked to scuba dive the week in Cozumel. The hotel finally agreed to give us ferry ride tickets from Playa to Cozumel on the dive days but that would mean catching the 6AM ferry for a 30-45 min ride one way. That just wouldn\u2019t work out. We ended up diving on the Playa side at Dive Adventuras (which was probably one of the better dive outfits on that side) but it was located more than half an our south of the Playacar Palace by shuttle that we had to pay for. The diving cost was higher by about $20 per dive from what we had planned in Cozumel and the diving was not very good at all. Rough waves, my wife got sick the fist day and was not able to dive the remainder of our trip. There is not much to see on this side compared to over in Cozumel where we have dived before. We would never come back to Playa do dive (except maybe for cenote dive). We also lost our dive deposit on the Cozumel side since we weren\u2019t able to dive there. Once we arrived at the Playacar Palace they were even less helpful. It was later in the evening after the ferry boat ride from Cozumel. They didn\u2019t explain any of the hotel amenities to us or give us any sort of orientation. It almost felt as if we were a bother for them being transferred from Cozumel. We had problems with our room, dripping condensation from the air conditioner that made the floor slippery. We had to place a large bath towel on the floor there for the entire week. The shower handle came off and it took several calls to get it fixed. They were prompt to fix things but missed the shower handle twice until I had to take it off and show them. They had to replace our in-room safe one morning. They rooms were smaller than were we were supposed to stay in Cozumel. By the way this trip was to celebrate our anniversary and to dive. It took repeated trips to the help desk to get our ferry passes. It cost us $5 every time we needed to check our email. There was no beach to speak of, only a very small sandy area in front of the hotel and no way to walk along any beach from this location. Its location to the ferry pier made our walk with all our luggage not too bad, its good we are in pretty good shape. And it is close to the 5th Ave. shopping district. But seeing that once was enough. There wasn\u2019t anything to do at the hotel other than eat and sit by the pool or watch the surf. We did check out the Adventura Spa Palace but had to pay $40 round trip taxi fare to see it. They wouldn\u2019t even shuttle us from Playacar to the other Palace resorts (other than the long ride to Moon up north). This was a very bad experience. We will never come back to the Playacar Palace. We never would have gone there in the first place except that\u2019s where they stuck us after messing up our reservation in Cozumel. Oh, and did I mention that no one at the hotel was willing to do anything to make this right for us. The help desk has the gull to offer us a Champagne breakfast and take more of our time so they could sell of a time share. The only good thing was we could hear the sound of the pounding surf with our balcony door open at night which made it nice to sleep by. Most of the staff was friendly but the ones who could have help us with our situation never came forward to help and those who could have asked for us didn\u2019t. I would have rated this review as 2 stars but the sound of the surf really wasn\u2019t in their control except for when they built the hotel at that location.

They told us to just leave our things and bring what we needed for the night and we could either move everything the next morning or go back to our original room assuming it was repaired. Within 30 minutes from the intial call, we were sound asleep.

Here are a couple of things we observed and what we thought. The food was great, nothing earth shattering, but very good, both the Italian and the Asian restaurant was very satisfying. The breakfast and lunch buffets were also great. There was a wide selection and the quality was great. Also, I think everyone ordered a club sandwich around 2 or 3am everynight, and it was always great. The room service didn't disappoint anyone. The drinks were plentiful and if you ask (and tip) the drinks could be made stronger. But, if you drink all day long, eventually they will get to you. The mini bar in the hotel rooms were great. They had a 6-pack of beer and 4 full bottles of booze, both of which are refilled within minutes of asking. We didn't use the booze really, because we were never in the room, but they were there just in case. For anyone thinking of having a wedding at Playacar Palace...highly recommended! Our wedding coordinator was Yazmin Perez and I would recommend her for anyone's wedding. (I think she always works at the Adventura Spa) It took us about 45 minutes to iron out all the details for the wedding. My wife was very happy with the flower selection and their appearance. The wedding terrace was beautiful and overall we could not have asked for anything else. If you have enough people, I suggest you try to book the ball room (free) and have a typical reception. I honestly could not recommend this resort enough to hold your wedding...we were and are extremely happy we held the wedding there. A couple cons: There were some kids there. We had to go here instead of the Adventura (adults only) because a couple friends may have brought their kids. But they didn't overrun the resort and we were there on spring break, so it wasn't annoying, but it's all personal preference. Booking everyone's reservation through Playacar's travel agency in Miami WAS A BEATING!! I don't know if they were understaffed or there was a language barrier (at least part of the problem), but if you don't have to, I would not book through the resort itself.

I loved many things about the hotel, and some things were not so much. First, the not-so-much. ROOMS: We booked one of the Honeymoon Suites. I was prepared to not get it upon arrival based on the reviews that I read here. As expected, we did not get the Honeymoon Suite. However, instead of being honest about it, they said that they were \"upgrading\" us to a Governor's Suite. We asked if it was the same as the Honeymoon Suite (i.e. bigger patio and room), and we were assured that it was \"nicer.\" Well, it is not. Those suites are the same size as the Honeymoon Suites, but they have a much smaller patio. When we brought this to their attention the next day, they offered to move us to a Honeymoon Suite the next morning when it would be open. We were taking a tour the next day, so we couldn't do it. Plus, it's a pain to pack up your stuff and move. Again, the staff really wasn't honest about the differences. I found one staff member named \"Mario\" (or something like that) to be the most disingenuous. FOOD: The food was average at best. The Asian restaurant was terrible. Really. I live in Chicago, so perhaps I am spoiled, but it was beyond bad. The Italian was decent. The buffet was generally good, so we ate there most of the time. We also went out a good bit. What is with a Mexican resort not having a restaurant that specializes in Mexican food?? It made me sad. Now the good: STAFF and SERVICE: Lovely people, and they make every effort to satisfy your needs. ROOMS: Though we didn't get the room we reserved, the rooms are really nice. The pillows rock. LOCATION: You just can't beat the proximity to 5th avenue and the ferry. VIEW: Most of the rooms have an incredible view. I'm not sure that I would go back to the Playacar Palace.

It is true, there is not a usable beach at PP, but the ocean is accessible and a great swim--we were out there everyday. I think we were lucky that the place was not fully booked. There were plenty of options at the pool and bar service was generally fast. The waitresses around the pool were fairly attentive, but we did have to get our own drinks a couple of times (poor us!) The restaurants weren't bad. For us, breakfast and lunch don't matter a whole lot, so we ate there everyday, but we opted to eat away from the AI on a couple of nights. I would agree that there wasn't a lot of authentic Mexican available, but in general, the food was prepared well. The rooms are very clean and it was quiet for us. The double jacuzzi tub was a great way to end the day at the pool, or to end the night. They keep the bottled water well stocked, along with other drinks/refreshments.

The pool was way too warm for me. It felt like bath water. Certainly not an option to cool off in the pool. I Read comments that the resort didn't feel clean. Yes, there was an occassional wine glass or plate outside the rooms but overall, the resort was very clean. The public bathrooms were cleaned continuously and the bars and restaurants were clean; which are the most important things to me. There was easy access to the fitness center which is located at the Playacar Golf Club about 3/4 mile away. The food was fine - typical AI food. We weren't impressed with the Italian Restaurant. Thought the Asian restaurant was good. The wine was great. By the 2nd day, the bartenders knew us by name and offered our drink of choice. Our teenage kids would have been bored at this resort. It was very quiet and relaxing. By 10:00p.m. - seems all guests were either in town or tucked away in bed. We loved the view from our balcony and the deck overlooking the ocean was wonderful.

On arriving in the dark about 7 in the evening I thought we had gone to an underground car park due to the extensive use of concrete and white lighting. One of the first things that strikes you is that everything is white lit with low power / long life lighting. The 'Italian' restaurant is a cross between a school dining hall and a public swimming pool. The tables are laid out in long rows in a large rectangular hall with a public viewing area above where people can look down as you eat. There is absolutely no atmosphere and can be very noisey even with only a few people dining due to the lack of furnishings. The food was average but with a very limited menu. Service was good but you can have a 3 course meal and be in and out within 30 mins and not the place if you are looking for a 'romantic meal' The Oriental is only marginally better. At least it has some colour! The Mexican buffet restaurant is okay but if you have already had breakfast and lunch you don't want to have your evening meal there as it is a bit like a cafeteria although the service is very good. The main bar area reminded me of an airport departure lounge after the last flight had gone. Again no atmosphere and very spartan furnishing (all white) with no customers. The rooms were well appointed but again very white with white lampshades and white / grey pictures. On the plus side the location is excellent being only 2 - 3 mins walk to the nightlife and ferry terminal for Cozimel. The bus station again is only a very short walk making it great for visiting Cancun and Tulum. If you are already booked to stay here I would suggest that you take the ferry to Cozimel and dine in their partner hotel the Cozimel Palace. It is also worth getting a taxi down to the Adventura Palace for an evening out. Bigger and much better choice of dining. This is smaller than most of the Playacar hotels with about 280 rooms which makes it a very nice size. Overall we had a great holiday due to its excellent location.

On numerous occasions, room service trays were left in the hallways without being picked up for hours. I would leave my room at 7:00am, and the same trays would be in the halls at 3:00pm. My room (room 200) was large and had a nice view, but had plumbing issues. The shower floor was not level, and the drain was on the high side which caused water to accumulate.

We all agreed that this was a very nice vacation, the Playacar Palace was relaxing and professionally managed, and that one of the best perks is the easy access to the heart of the city. We had a room without a balcony, but this made it feel really like the Caribbean came right up to the window. It was terrific fun to watch the activity around the ferryboats to Cozumel, which is close enough to see but not really be bothered by. The room was modern, clean and very comfortable. We enjoyed the food, 3 meals a day. The core restaurant is primarily Mexican with a great and varied assortment every day. I don't like super sweet desserts...so their Mexican donuts were some of the best donuts I've ever eaten. They are not greasy or overly sweet. They offer wonderful fruits. I always asked for warm tortillas from the grill and the staff was happy to provide. Nice omelette service. Delicious grilled fish, chicken and steak at lunch and dinner. A few times it felt pretty crowded in there. Actually we were probably there at a slow time at first, then in the final days it seemed to get more crowded. One complaint: we drink tea and their tea water always tasted like coffee had been in the tea pitcher. We had to always ask for \"agua caliente directamente de la maquina, por favor\" They need to address that! We didn't try the Chinese restaurant even though we were there for 7 nights. It's a sit-down service restaurant and, frankly, the menu looked pretty unappealing. It just didn't feel right to eat Chinese when we had this wonderful Mexican buffet. We did try the Italian restaurant, but only one night. It's beautifully appointed and the service was excellent. But the entrees, though pretty, were not that appetizing. They lacked something, we all agreed. Still, we probably should have given it a second try. There is a restaurant at the Gym/Spa/Golf Club too (which is a 10 minute shuttle ride). This was probably one of our worst meals. It felt like a bad American chain restaurant menu, although the decor was nice. Back at the hotel, outdoors, as others noted, there is no real beach, although you can enter the sea and go for a swim and there is a lifeguard from the hotel. However, you would need to walk up a couple blocks to reach the town beach. It didn't bother us because if we're going to lounge our family seems to prefer the pool area. The pool is pretty and they have upgrade the chairs to some very nice, bambooish chairs in natural colors. There are some plastic ones too, but we never had a problem finding a place to park ourselves. The poolside activities are OK, not terrific. They are rather repetitive and the rec staff seemed a bit disfunctional. Still, we prefer this level of interaction to some blow-hard with a microphone shouting at everyone. The bar staff is good and always accomodating. We don't drink a lot, but all the drinks we had were fine. We did a few of the activities--Tulum tour, Xpu-Ha palace, snorkeling, spa afternoon, and we visited two other Palace resorts -- Moon palace (really low-class zoo) and Xpu-Ha Palace (OK, but way damaged by hurricane and in the middle of construction so it felt like it was limping at about 30%). We took the offer to hear the Palace's club talk. They were of course super pushy but we just said no, no, no thanks. They did push us for the full 1.5 hours, however. We really concluded that the 200 room size found at the Palace is probably the best size for our tastes instead of the megaHotels, Moon or Aventura. We like walking, and out the front door and to the left you can walk through some beautiful private residential neighborhoods in Playacar.

There were pasta selections every night, lots of fruit and veggies, a cheese bar, salad bar, rice, etc. If we told the chief working the grill that we wanted a veggie dish - they would cook us up something special - we were very happy with the selections - this isn't 5 star dining but lots of good healthy food and you could eat all day long if you wanted to. We tended to eat early - breakfast at 7am, lunch at noon and dinner at 6pm - we never had a band playing while we ate - I'm thinking they must start later - so that's an option if you're looking for a little peace and quiet. We were not bothered excessively by the staff at meals - attentive, but not overbearing. We tipped a couple bucks at every meal - we never noticed anyone else tipping and didn't see that it made any difference - but my husband liked to because he thought the service was so good. laundry - there is not a washer and dryer on the premises for guest use - they have laundry service but it is very expensive - I had 4 items sent out and it cost over $20 - just to have it washed (not dry-cleaned) this may be important if your planning a longer stay. Information on the beach seems to be conflicting - I would say that there is no beach at this hotel. Now, there is water and there is sand under the water - but nothing that you could throw a towel down on and do for a dip. At one point when walking near the sea wall with my daughter (at low tide) I noticed a couple feet of sand that you could maybe sit on and not actually be in the water but don't pick this hotel for the beach. Basically you have two options. Leave the front of the hotel and walk 5 minutes to the right, down toward the ferry and there is a public beach - lots of locals, bar, small playground for kids, soccer net and volleyball net - fun, lots of young people, Donna Summer pumping out of the bar stereo. I made my daughter put her shoes on to walk on the beach and we never went in the water - you get the picture. Your other option is to leave the hotel and walk 5 minutes to your left. Pretend you don't see the signs telling you it's private property, avoid eye contact with the guard at the parking area and walk to the beach like you own it. No one will stop you and if you ask the hotel staff - they won't tell you about it - also not the prettiest beach we have ever seen but we picked up some seashells and my daughter got to make a sand castle. I'm not sure how some folks are saying there is a beach at the hotel - I guess people just have different ideas about what constitutes a beach - I would be happy to answer any questions on this if you have any - We loved the evening shows - some of them were a little \"yawn\" but we went to the show almost every night and especially liked the magician, the circus, the fire and drums and the mexican dancers.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Zurich, Il", "Title": "\u201cCharming and Great location\u201d", "Author": "chantal0523", "ReviewID": "UR13337673", "Content": "Spent 1 week at Playacar in Jan 2008. We had some rough weather for the 1st couple days, didn't see one little sun ray. But, Jorge the bartender made sure we didn't care. Some key points to consider: Small hotel, which we prefer. This not a mega resort that requires transportation just to get to lobby. Mayan palace in PV was like that. Kid friendly. Tastefully decorated. Simple yet classy. Service was excellent(tipping helps). Every employee in that place makes a point to say hello and make your stay comfortable. We tipped $5 or $10 to the bartender if we sat there most of the day. We'd also give the waitress a couple dollars every other round. Left the maids a tip at the end of the week. At dinner, brkfst and lunch, we'd leave a few dollars here and there. Location is great. We'd have dinner and some cocktails then walk over to 5th avenue, which is really cute. No car traffic allowed. I always felt safe and the vendors are not as bad as I've seen in other places, such as Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta. We used the gym, which is over in the golf club. They offer transportation but we chose to jog over there. It took us about 15-20min. It's in a nice little neighborhood. Tours- we did the Tulum Express tour. It's about a 45 minute ride from the hotel. We were able to stop at the Aventura Palace.Looks very nice. It's adults only and about 15 minutes further from town. You can use the all-inclusive package at any of their resorts, Aventura included. So,you can take a cab and spent the day over there. The tour was good. Stories about the Ruins were interesting. They let u swim in the beautiful beach. Diving- I did the Tortugas and Barracude dives. Pretty good visibility. We saw some turtles, eagle ray, lobster, eel(big). We used Scuba Playa dive shop, somewhere at 5th and 10th(I think). good group of people. I was bit nervous, since I haven't had a dive in 2 1/2 years. My divemaster, a thin, French girl (can't remember her name) , really looked after me. After my dive, I hung-out by the beach and watched the action on the beach. They charge u $5 for a comfy lounger. No there wasn't a beach at the hotel. But- we didn't find this a problem. You can still walk down the stairs and jump in the beautiful water. There are plenty of pool seats overlooking the ocean, you really won't miss it. Food- okay, it's not the best you'll ever eat and u might even get bored of the dinner choices after a week. But, I found it acceptable with enough choices. I'm not an all-inclusive type usually. But, I did love the guacomole and chips! Room- kept very clean and a comfy bed. Mini-bar always stocked. Ocean view. We did wake up one morning with a huge leak in our ceiling by the bathroom. They upgraded us to a suite with a private deck. Not too shabby I've been to numerous Mexican destinations. This really was one of my favorites. I'm too antsy to sit in one hotel for a whole week. Due to it's location, it has a lot of options. You can go to Cancun, Cozumel, or one of their sister resorts. We took the ferry over to Cozumel one day. It's about a 30minute(rocky ride). We rented a jeep and spent the whole day driving around the less populated side of the island.

The hotelroom was a very nice surprise: huge bed, jacuzzi, fully filled up minibar, a nice and clean bathroom - and a wonderful seaview. The restaurants have wide variety of food and you can always find a free table at one of the three restaurants. We preferred the Italian restaurant for dinner (had a marvellous steak in balsamic vinegar).Very well trained staff everywhere. The pool area is nice, with continuous waiter service. Animation is also continuous, can be a bit noisy but if you lay in the sunbathing area (several steps from the pool) there is absolutely no problem with the animators. The staff was very friendly - no language problems at all. (Maybe the cleaning staff does not speak English, but with a smile and some creativity everything could be arranged and understood.)

This was my third stay at the resort; previous stays were in March 2006 and January 2007 (and at Aventura Spa Palace in April 2005). As with the previous trips, I had a wonderful experience. In fact, because I've so enjoyed previous trips, my finance and I decided to get married at the resort and we did so on this trip. With regard to the wedding, I could not have been much happier with the way things went. As others have noted, we \"had\" to be at the resort for 3 days prior to the ceremony for legal purposes. We actually arrived 5 days in advance; the only downside was that we had to wait a few days to meet with Yazmin, our wedding coordinator. She did a fabulous job of making sure everything was as we wanted it, but waiting to meet with her was a bit stressful since I did not know that then. I had communicated with her by email several times in advance of going to Mexico - about flowers, music, and the reception, etc. - and everything was finalized when we did meet. (If you have special requests, I would recommend communicating with your coordinator in advance, although choices in selections are provided during the pre-wedding meeting.) The flowers were beautiful, and the wedding terrace overlooking the water is a wonderful and intimate setting. The hair and makeup person (Rosa) did a great job, and I much enjoyed and need the massage. Following our afternoon ceremony, we had scheduled cocktail time and a seated dinner reception in the ballroom. The food and drinks were fantastic, and the reception site was exactly as I had requested. The only complaint I have is that the ballroom was fairly dark, so the pictures on our disposable cameras are almost all useless. The photographer and the videographer included in the wedding package we purchased were very good; the pictures are very professionally done. We enjoyed the post wedding breakfast and honeymooners dinner, too. All in all, I very much recommend a wedding at the Playacar Palace. We had approximately 20 friends and family attend the wedding, only two of whom had previously stayed at the resort. Without exception, they were all very pleased with the Playacar Palace and the food, and they found the service to be fantastic, sentiments with which I fully agree. Indeed, in all of my stays (covering more than 3 weeks) at the resort, I have always enjoyed the food. I think I've only had one or two meals that were only acceptable; the rest were always very good to fantastic. The food in Casa del Mar is excellent and some of the Mayan dishes they serve are superb. The wine is ok; I agree with a previous posting about the fact that it could be better. Other alcohol is top shelf, though. The room service menu is somewhat limited, but since it is included and is available 24 hours, I'm fine with that. The entertainment provided is usually pretty good. We saw the fire show again and still enjoyed it. We also saw an interesting circus show one evening, and the karoke is fun to participate in. I did not take any trips this time, but friends enjoyed the zip lines above the jungle and the trip to Chichen Itza. As others have noted, there is not much beach at the resort. However, immediately to the south and just north (past the ferry stop) of the resort are good beaches. The pool seemed to be heated, but there were too many children (none of whom seemed to be wearing pool diapers) in the water for my taste. Nonetheless, there are ample chairs poolside and the drink service is great. The spa is small but wonderfully staffed and maintained. The same are true of the fitness room. Both are located at the golf course, about a 20 minute very pleasant walk away. (A van also travels between locations through out the day.) The one problem with the fitness room though is that it does not have an associated locker room. One is available for the golfers but did not have soap, etc., for showering and while the spa locker room can be used it is clear that that is not considered a good option unless using the spa services. The spa services themselves are great; as others have noted the hydro therapy is great. Margarita, one of the staff who works in the women's locker room at the spa, is especially good and attentive. The staff overall deserve special mention. The level and quality of service are exceptional. The staff go out of their way to accomodate guests if they can and are always friendly. Also, because this is a smaller resort they remember guests (they even remembered my fiance and me from our previous stay the year before). The main negatives I have found at the Playacar Palace are the relative lack of non-smoking areas (except for the restaurants) and too many kids running around at times (although this is not an all adults resort and there are things for them to do). While I did not go for the time-share sales pitch this trip, unless one is interested in buying in it is definitely not worth the freebies. Some of the public area furniture is also starting to look a little worn. Nonetheless, despite these minor negatives I will be returning to the Playacar Palace in the future, hopefully soon and often!", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "mississauga", "Title": "\u201cLoved the resort but not the view!\u201d", "Author": "kayjayMississauga", "ReviewID": "UR12324459", "Content": "The service staff, cleanliness and layout of this compact resort were all top notch but we were very dissappointed when we found out our rooms were located at the back of the building overlooking the air conditioning units and a condo complex!

We all paid the top room-rate but when we arrived, 3 rooms were beautiful ocean-views while my family got 2 rooms at the back of the hotel. When we asked about changing rooms, the day manager said they were fully booked and when we said we were willing to move when one became available, he claimed that no one was leaving an ocean view room in the next week.

If the view doesn't matter to you, however, there are lots of pluses about this hotel: -good for elderly people who can't walk far or wait for shuttles -good selection of fresh food at the buffet grill -tiny beach but good ocean swimming with sandy bottom just steps from the pool -lots of chaise lounges -good-sized rooms with beautiful marble throughout -quick, friendly service whether it be for room service or something that needs to be fixed -contrary to other reviews, we didn't find it musty-smelling or the beds too hard -enthusiastic, genuine activity directors for daytime activities and some good nightly entertainment (see the magician and the Mexican dancers) -close to town and other attractions -excellent, friendly staff at the guest services desk -priveledges at other Palace Resorts: we had a great day of free snorkeling at Cozumel Palace and the jungle animals at Xpu-Ha Palace were great to see (just be sure to use the shuttle as it is a very long walk!) on our way back from Tulum cons: -no disco (management would be smart to hire a disc jockey rather than the local band for entertainment some nights) -only 2 full service restaurants -no where to do a morning beach walk -one rather small pool that fills quickly with children -unaccommodating and unfriendly front desk staff All in all, the pros greatly outnumbered the cons and we would recommend this hotel highly (keeping in mind that if the view and beach are of great importance, you might want to look elsewhere).

We had not done the \"all-inclusive\" thing outside of cruises and had heard great reviews on Palace Resorts. All in all, we were extremely pleased with this resort. The room was beautiful (we chuckled that people on this web site were actually complaining about the shower doors, because the bathrooms were beautiful). We had a fabulous view of the ocean and loved the jacuzzi overlooking the balcony. The bed was also luxurious and super-comfortable. Don't pay too much attention to the complaints about the entrance not looking like much...one you arrive and are inside, it's actually very lovely and unique with its open-air design. The pool area was great, too, although we can understand the complaints about the lack of beach if you are committed to lying on the sand. The swim-up bar was pretty cool and there were lots of chairs and few crowds. We ventured over to Cozumel Palace in hopes of doing some snorkeling (definitely a bonus to be able to use the other resorts, and we would have done so more had our stay been longer). However, the day was windy and their beach was closed. Fortunately, since our stay was so short, we were content with the pool. The food, overall, was OK. The buffet restaurant was more than substantial for breakfast and lunch, with a nice variety. However, we travel frequently and enjoy eating at restaurants with high-end food and wine. While the food in the Italian restaurant was pretty good, the wine list was a bit of a joke (my husband is in the wine business)...we were quite surprised to be in an Italian restaurant with virtually NO Italian wines on the wine list! The Mexican was pretty good, too...we didn't like the looks of the menu at the Asian place and opted for our third dinner on Fifth Avenue (which, by the way, is another HUGE benefit to this resort...the location is spectacular, with a five-minute walk to the Fifth Avenue pedestrian shopping zone). A highlight of our stay was a visit to Xel Ha to swim with the dolphins. This was fabulous experience and I was so glad to have done it. The facility is beautiful with lots to do...we had no trouble spending most of a day there. I would say that I found the biggest negative of this resort to be the \"bait-and-switch\" and sneaky tactics used to entice you into their sales pitch on (I assume, because we didn't go) the time shares. We were offered all sorts of perks on the day we arrived (free spa services, golf, tours, etc.), while never being told that there was a two-hour pitch involved (silly us). We told the woman we'd like to take some time to figure out what we wanted to do, since we only had two full days for activities. When we returned to her desk the next day to talk about taking advantage of some of the offers, we were told that they were no longer in effect and that we had to sign up the day before. Also, we noticed that many of the tours were only offered on one or two days during the week, so we weren't able to take advantage of any of them that interested us because of the timing of our trip. Overall, we really liked this resort and will definintely go back in spite of the couple of negatives I mentioned above.

The service was great. The food was good. The wedding went well. I would recommend getting married here. The wedding package we chose included everything we wanted and more including massages. The massages were great and the hydrotherapy room at the spa is amazing. Be sure to go an hour before your spa appointment to fully enjoy the hydrotherapy room. We met our wedding coordinator Cristina when we got there and arranged everything. It was very easy and she got everything we asked for. The wedding terrace is nice but small. Beware that a wedding with more than 20 people would not be suited for this hotel. I liked the fact that the terrace was away from public areas so our ceremony was private. Unlike the ceremonies we saw at Adventura that were at the beach and anyone could watch. The flowers were beautiful. The cake was very good. One thing we weren't aware of was to bring our own vows so we simply skipped that part. The hair and makeup person was great. I did a practice for my hair which I would recommend to make sure you get what you want. The hotel itself was wonderful. The drinks were great the service wonderful. The staff was always friendly. We stayed in a honeymoon suite room 143 which was amazing. I think the best room in the hotel. You don't need to bring many toiletries with you many are there inlcuding; toothbrush and toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner (biosilk), lotion (biosilk), and a few other things.

This was our 2nd stay there (stayed June 2006) and would go back again in a heartbeat. We like the smaller resorts where we get to know some of the staff, they remember us and my children won't get lost! Our room (419) faced the ocean so we had a spectacular view. My room was always clean with fresh towels, fresh fruit, restocked refrigerator & bar. Had the bed turned down every night, usually with something made with towels (like swan, elephant, heart, etc) and chocolates! The restaurants were good. I will say that there was less variety in food available from previous stay but everything is still really good. Breakfast is wonderful! For dinners, the Mexican buffet is good, the Italian restaurant was very good but the Asian restaurant was just okay, in my opinion. My children are 9 and 5 so they did some of the Kids Club activities. Desmares (in Kids Club) is fabulous with the children and always makes it fun for them. They have evening activities (7-9pm) so parents can have dinner alone which was super! Pool is wonderful, poolside service is typically good and fairly frequent. The tiles around the pool have been roughed up so there is no slipping like in the past. The ONLY thing missing for us is that there really is NO beach left there. There was a bit of beach there in June 2006 but it is gone now. I don't know if that is permanent or just seasonal with a higher tide. But you can reach beaches by walking in the water along the walls. We found a rock pool nearby to see lots of crabs, turtle shells, etc. We also used the Spa and that experience was just okay.

Luxury and good food and location was more important to me than having a beach. Our room was 5 stars, the view from the balcony was breathtaking, everyday was picture perfect, I loved the huge shower and sink area, nice flat screen tv on the wall, the room was the luxury I was looking for. The food was just as wonderful, we love Mexican food with an enormous passion, dh and I would never eat any other food if Mexican was available, we ate every meal at the buffet, we had no interest in Italian or Asian . 5 stars for the buffet and all it's variety, our teen son was along and is a very picky eater, I thought he would lose weight on this vacation but not a chance at this buffet! By the end of the 2cnd day our son was becoming bored at the resort, I realized he really missed the beach and there was not much for kids to do at this resort, we convinced him to give the poolside activities a try and by the 3rd day he was willing, the activities were perfect for teens and older and we looked forward to the daily activity sheets from then on however the activity sheets disappeared after the 3rd day and we never saw another one. This is where the dislikes come in, a lot of inconsistency's, we asked for sugar free beverages stocked in our mini fridge as my dh is diabetic. When we left a tip in the fridge we got our choice beverages but when we didn't leave a tip, we got no drinks restocked at all and after 24 hours we had to call for drinks to be stocked, we didn't even have water for coffee anymore. From then on we felt we had to tip the drink restocker. Also we didn't like the late maid service, our room was not cleaned until 5pm or later, we would come back to the room after being out in the heat all day and had no clean towels to shower and you didn't feel as though you could rest or get ready for dinner cause the maid was still due to come. Dh gently complained about this on the 3rd day and the resort promptly arranged for us to have earlier maid service which really made us happy. It says \" room service\" but phone number was always busy, impossible to get through. Also being a beer drinker , all that was available was a tap mexican brew that I could not stomach, the only other option was a can of tecate light which I could drink but only a few available in your room per day, not at any bar area, beer drinkers beware! Otherwise, bar service and top notch alcohol flowed freely. I found it humorous that we had 3 persons in our room but we were only allowed 2 chocolates at night, you would think they could spare another chocolate beings we paid full price for 3 people!

The Playacar Palace was selected by my step-daughter as the venue for her wedding, after which she transfered to the Aventura Palace for her honeymoon. It is the closest of the resorts in the Playacar zone of Playa del Carmen to downtown and a short stroll from the main shopping areas /Cozumel ferry. Some reviewers say Playacar Palace has a beach and others don't. Both are accurate statements. At high tide there usually isn't a beach, the access steps will take you straight to the sea. At low tide there is a small strip of sand, and you could conceivably lay a towel on it without the waves reaching it, but the sand underneath would soon be wet. The rooms were spacious and clean with most having ocean views. Occupancy seemed quite low and we were able to access all facilities without any trouble (restaurants, pool chairs, bar service) in fact when having an early dinner at the restaurants the staff generally outnumbered the diners and provided very prompt, friendly service. The pool was pleasant, clean and had a great view across the sea. The wedding service was pleasant, simple and to the point (largely due to the wishes of the bride and groom, but if you wanted a more elaborate service the free one provided by the Palace with a few optional extras added in probably isn't going to be quite what you're after) on the far northern balcony. Not the best place for photos with all the white paint and glare from the sky (we walked around to the beach/rocks to the south for a lot of the pictures.) The food was good with the extensive selection in the buffet providing plenty of choice for everyone. We had some fussy eaters in our greater party and none had any problems finding a variety of edibles to keep them happy. As part of our package we received access to the many of the tours offered through Chaza Tours for free. While at the Playacar Palace we took advantage of trips to Tulum (best seen before the larger, more magnificent sites, the setting, open lay of the land and green grass give this place a visual/ photogenic quality greater than the architecture alone provides), Chichen Itza (a magnificent, large site - go beyond the main pyramid temple if you can to the Observatory and 'Nunnery' if you can) and Ek-Balam/Valladolid (the Ek-Balam site had very few other visitors, lots of structures that could be climbed on and the main structure is worth the trip on it's own. The brief stop in the town of Valladolid only provided enough time for a brief gawk and for buying souvenirs from the numerous vendors, not the best way to see this place and a fairly pointless extension of the trip.)", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cWonderful service, great location\u201d", "Author": "howboutit", "ReviewID": "UR11467900", "Content": "This is our second visit to Playacar Palace and it was wonderful again.

Due to my aversion to all-inclusive resorts we decided not to book anything in advance and check the place when we get there and make the decision on the spot. When we arrived at the resort we were really impressed by the open spaces and the light and the air of the place. We had no problem getting the room shown to us and the staff was very friendly. We decided to stay for a couple of days and then (again due to my aversion to all-inclusive resorts) look for an ocean front condo. Long story short our stay was so pleasant that we kept extending our stay at the resort during our full stay in Mexico. The staff was remarkably and geniuinely friendly. Tips were really optional (didnt feel getting pushed for paying tips) but the service was really worth tipping. The resort has three restaurants and the quality of the food and the restaurant service was very good and comparable to service we get in good restaurants in San Francisco. The stay also came with a long list of available tours that are included in the price. We did the day tour of ChichenItza and it was a really nice one. The other big advantage of this resort is that it's part of a chain that includes several resorts in the area. As a guest to any resort you have access to all the facilities in all the other ones. We tried the restaurant in the aventuras and cozumel and snorkeling in cozumel (conveniently the ferry docks 10 minutes from the hotel). So you never feel trapped or bored in the same resort. We also liked the fact that compared to other ones this resort was smaller and you could get around very easily. Also, every night there is some performance. We loved the fire show. Just by itself this could be a great show to attend and pay for and there we had it from our balconies included in the price. The resort includes several guest service desks that were very helpful in giving us options for the tours and suggestions about places to visit in the area. We were a little disappointed that when we checked in the staff did not do a good job describing what was included in the price so it took us a day or two to find out about the available included tours. The place was quiet and even thoug h we were in a resort we felt we had privacy in our room. Also the bath tub in the room was a great feature. In one of our dips in the tub we saw some bits of brown leaves coming out of the jets and we never found out why.

When we arrived at the resort, the honeymoon suite was booked up. So in exchange they gave us the governers suite, which is an upgrade from the HM suite, at no charge extra! They definitely go out of their way to make you happy. Check-in was smooth even though we had a problem with our reservation (they didn't have a record that we prepaid the AI fees) However, after a few phone calls the issue was resolved. They apologized many times for the mix up and made sure we were happy. While we were waiting, they kept bringing us drinks! It only took about 20 minutes for the entire process. We stayed in room 210, the governers suite. It was beautiful!! We had 2 balcony's, a living room separate from the bedroom and a mini bar in both rooms. The place would be a nice apartment to live in, it's that big!! The resort does provide a lot in the rooms, including toothbruse, toothpast, shoe shine kit, mouthwash, full size shampoo and conditioner (biosilk), and many other items. The shampoo/conditioner was a really great product and my hair can be touchy. I wish I didn't bring all that with me! Service is excellent in all the restaurants and the food is amazing. Definitely 5 star. We didn't get tired of the food since there was so much on the menus, we had something different every night. Bartenders at all the bars aim to please and I now have a new favorite drink. They never let your glass get empty. Even on our last day after check-out, we received a day pass so we could still eat and drink until our shuttle arrived. They were still happy to help you and even made us drinks to go for our shuttle ride to the airport! The fire show and mexican show are must sees. I would skip the circus show unless you have kids, they might enjoy it. But in my honest opinion, I thought it was a bit cheesy and we were a bit bored with it. I see a previous review talked about the golf party (about 20 guys were there). We were there that same week. They didn't bother us, we even sat in the same restaurant 2 nights in a row. Yes they were loud and drunk. But once we told the waiter that it was bothering us they went and talked to them. They were a lot quieter after that. The people at the resort can't read your mind, but they do everything possible to make you happy. So if you don't say anything, how can they fix it? (Sorry had to vent a bit). Anyways, they are allowed to have a good time too, right? Since we prepaid the AI fees, we received the tour package for free. The tours were excellent (Chaza Travel) and the guides very knowledgeable. We went to Chichen Itza, Tulum/Xpu-Ha and Paradise snorkeling. We did go to Coba on a previous trip, and that is also a must see. You can still climb the pyramid at Coba, but the other sites you can't. We were a little disappointed with the snorkeling because it wasn't the beauty we expected in a huge coral reef. But none-the-less it was free and we had a great time, so I can't complain. But I would suggest taking a charter tour through a different company if you want to see bigger Corals and more colorful fish. Afterwards, we enjoyed laying on the beach in the Marina, as we didn't opt to do the additional activities. Be beware, the place in not included with your AI fees until lunch is served. You had to pay for your drinks and they would come around every 5 min, it became quite annoying, so we walked further down the beach. HOWEVER, at lunch the drinks are included. We also took the ferry over to Cozumel Island (make sure to get the 1 way ticket since there are 2 company's, it's the same price) and walked to the Palace resort there. It was about a 15 minute walk (turn right at the end of the ferry dock) or you can take a cab for $3. The vibe at the CP was much more of a Party vibe with a younger crowd. We had a lot of fun there hanging out at the swim up bar and watching the vollyball game. At the buffet there was a little more of a selection to choose from than PCP and it was still all very good. There is great shopping on 5th Avenue, and yes be prepared to be haggled as you walk down the street. But that is just the way Mexico is, just ignore them. There is one silver place that I really loved and the guy didn't haggle or mess with us at all. He was very honest and gave us great prices (what they are actually worth!!) I wish I could remember the name of the store, but lost in the shuffle is the card and I can't find it. However, If you are walking down 5th Ave from the pier/hotel it is on the 2nd block on the left side. The store looks small from the outside but there are so many rooms that go further and further back. The guy didn't haggle or pressure us. He did follow us around, but only to make help us if we had questions. One piece of advice, bring your umbrella with you everywhere. It's not only great for the sporatic rain, it's also nice to have to shield the hot sun off your head, even if you have a hat on. Also, note that Tuesdays & Thursdays are cruise days, so the town gets a lot more crowded for shopping etc. Both 5th Ave and Cozumel. I feel the prices went up a bit too and we were definitely haggled more. Don't tell them you are on the cruise or that you are leaving tomorrow. Always say you are leaving in 7 days, that way they won't try to pressue you as much, since they know you have time to shop around. They may even give you a better deal. I hope this review helps you make your choice. I have several more photographs of the resort and our trip but this site isn't letting me upload them.

My recommendation is to take loads of small denomiator US dollars or tips (we did not take enough low digit US dollars) as tipping is the done thing in Mexico.

When it was time for us to discuss a wedding venue, we knew we wanted a destination wedding, and we knew we wanted it to be in Mexico. Our experience at ASP was phenomenal, but for a wedding, we knew it was not as intimate as we were hoping for, so started our research on the other Palace resorts. With its extremely close proximity (walking distance!) to the town of Playa (with its countless shops, restaurants and bars to choose from), and the reputation of a Palace resort, we knew we had a match with Playacar Palace. In some of the reviews we had read, the common theme was disappointment in their lack of a \"beach.\" True, there was no real beach, but a very short walk to the right of the resort and you could be on one, if that's what you were hoping for (we had many of our wedding photos taken on that beach). Sure, no bar service there, but we were so thrilled with the pool environment and the excellent staff that we didn't even THINK of going anywhere else! The staff went above and beyond to make sure that our entire group had everything we needed at all times. Alberto at the bar was always pouring us fun drinks and shots without having to be asked, and our VERY favorite cocktail/pool waitress, Yadira, felt like a part of our family by the end of the week. We were certainly sad to leave her! The wedding was perfect, communication leading up to our arrival was frustrating at times, but persistence went a long way to ensure all of our details were included. To plan an event like a wedding from so far away was nerve-racking at times, but everything was exactly as expected, as we did a lot of research (we knew we wouldn't be married on a beach, and knew that there wouldn't be a horse drawn carriage like at ASP). Ruse, the wedding coordinator, was so pleasant and helpful-they even designed a boquet for me which was NOT one of the standard choices! The restaurants were always very good, and the buffet was always well stocked with many options. Lunch at the pool usually also consisted of a grill/buffet style spread if you didn't want to go into the restaurant in your wet bathingsuit. I think the Italian restaurant was our favorite, but there's something to be said for the Mayan coffees they made us in the Asian restaurant! The pool was always the main attraction during the day. The activities staff was always working very hard to get everyone involved (including the kids), although it did not seem that the hotel was very full during our stay (although we did see two other weddings) and made the activities staff's job challenging. I don't think we had a single complaint-all of our guests had fantastic views from their rooms, and all 20 of us keep saying what an amazing trip it was. The proximity to town was a huge plus for our guests who felt like exploring, and a lot of us enjoyed touring the different bars and restaurants at night. There even happened to be a fishing tournament in town the week we were there! Please...feel free to contact me with questions. I'd be happy to talk about our wedding there (and any other details), as we had trouble finding anyone who had been married there prior to our trip! Okay...maybe our ONLY complaint was that they were still in the process of grinding the concrete around the pool to create ridges and make it less slippery-which was very loud, but had to be done.

Stayed four days. Loved the accommodations, the food, the service, the entertainment, and the town--pretty much everything. The entire compound is only a 2 or 3-minute walk from town, less to the Cozumel Ferry. The hotel is sitting right at the water's edge, so the beach is, at most 10 to 20 feet deep, and that's at low tide. The water actually came up the steps to the patio during high tide. Went swimming often, since the pool over-looks the ocean. Swam in both, from the same chaise lounge. It was like being on a concrete beach, complete with bar service! Rooms were large and immaculate, with a spectacular view of the ferries as they crossed, and Cozumel off in the distance---very romantic. There are several restaurants to choose from, including Asian-fusion and Italian. There is also a buffet/grill and an out-dour barbecue. If compared with American food, one might be disappointed, but if approached with the idea that it is Mexico's version of Italian or Asian, one might be pleasantly surprised. The food in all the restaurants was good. When they say all-inclusive, they mean it. Drinks flowed freely all day and night, including the bottle of Cabernet requested delivered for a romantic evening. The room service food was also good, and this would be a logical time to mention service in general. The service was fantastic! If anything, the staff is too attentive.

The food is good, one buffet and 2 ala carte restaurants. The beach is clean. The hotel is very near the ferry to Cozumel and near 5th Avenue where all the shops are so everything is very convenient. We went to Chankanaab Marine Park in Cozumel to swim with the dolphins and snorkel. It is a great place to snorkel. You can take the ferry over, go eat at the affliate hotel Cozumel Palace and spend the rest of the day at the marine park. We also did the \"Try Scuba\" in Playa del Carmen where you learn to scuba for about an hour and then are taken out for about a 40 foot dive. Do this in Playa del Carmen so you can get a deeper dive. The hotel travel agency booked everything for us. Make sure you use their services. They are very helpful. Our biggest problem occurred with the originating travel company, Worry Free.

We finally talked with someone at Worry Free and after some investigating, they confirmed the departure time for the next morning. We told them we wanted to add the night we lost onto the end of our stay. They said to talk to a representative in Mexico. We called each of the 5 days trying to extend our stay but each day we were told to call back in 10 minutes or they would call us. Finally, we just added the final night onto our credit card.

We also visited Cozumel Palace and Aventura Palace to see what they were like. Far superior to the Playaycar. The service at Playaycar was minimal unless you tip which we do regularly anywhere we go. I had forgot my bag in the room and while it was being retrieved I waited forever for service poolside. When it finally arrived so had my bag so I held off on the tip. Then the next order went in and was followed with a tip. Then the two servers were doubling up on the drinks anticipating a tip everytime. Another couple we were visiting with asked how we got such great service... go figure that one out. The food was cold even on the \"hot\" buffet which we did not experience at the other Palace resorts. Safe to stay with the grilled meat or the made to order eggs and fresh fruit. I found the restaraunts were better service but then again the food minimal with the exception of the sushi and egg rolls. Would I stay here again? NO. Even though I slipped and fell at Cozumel Palace (beware very slippery but they have etched the tile at Playacar) they were right there offering assistance and ice with sincerity. They allerted Playacar about my fall to followup with me... they didn't. Overall I would never return to Playacar Palace but yes to Aventura and Cozumel Palace resorts. I look at it like this. All inclusive resorts are very expensive when you don't consume much alcohol so we have always paid for the service that generally comes with not this time. maybe they could learn a thing or two from the Grand Velas in Nuevo Vallarta. Now that's a class act! Full 24 hour room service with a menu to drool over. Set out on your deck (rooms all ocean view) with white linens and candles. The all inclusive fee was less and went during high season. This really is an honest evaluation of the Playaycar Palace. We travel extensively and I do for a living. So buyer beware.

For example, all of our guests were on the 4th and 5th floors, and all guests who arrived early received early check-ins and did not have to wait. Also, even with the discounted group rate, tours were included in my guests' packages. Yasmin, our wedding coordinator, was perfect. We often communicated via email for the wedding details (e.g. flowers, music, wedding arch, menu, linens) and EVERY request I had was implemented. Pedro Basto was the events coordinator and he worked with Yasmin to make sure all of our needs were met. The highlights of the vacation were definitely the high level customer service and the execution of the wedding ceremony and reception events. The children loved the beach and pool and our adult guests spent great times in the wet bar! We enjoyed the buffet and the food at the Italian restaurant was great. My guests also loved the fact that the hotel was in close proximity to 5th Avenue--I took my guests on a walking tour the first evening down 5th Avenue to the Blue Parrot Beach Club. We had a ball and it was great because over the next few days, the guests would go into town in small groups for shopping. We stayed in the Governor's Suite (410) and it was amazing! I think the greatest compliment to the Playacar Palace is the fact that even with such a diverse group of people traveling--couples, couples with children and singles--EVERYONE had an amazing time. Also with a group this size, it was very nice to be the big fish in a little pond, meaning the hotel size was very intimate. It was nice to always run into one of my guests.

On reflection should have split the time between 2 resorts. I agree with all the good reports about the service - it would have been hard to fault it. The previous problems with the slippery pool surround are being sorted - except it is a bit disruptive if they are still working on it - the work is quite noisy and means large sections of the seating areas are roped off, Nevertheless the resort was not too full and we always managed to find shady pool beds although I guess this could be a problem in busier periods. I think I have rarely had more comfortable beds although King beds would leave a little more space in the rooms - the spa baths take up a lot of space. My only reservation was the food and this got very boring as time went on. The food in the Italian restaurant bore little resemblance to any that I have experienced on my many trips to Italy and the sauces tended to be rather too heavy. Having said that, the cold food on the buffet was excellent and kept very cold and fresh. I saw them frequently change the food on the hot plates but the food was often only lukewarm which made the freshly grilled meat and fish a better option. Unless you 'do' shopping think hard about the included trips - for instance on the Mujeres trip we left the beachclub in time to spend 1 1/2 hours in the town on the Island - a number of fellow guests commented that they would have preferred to spend the time on the beach.

We have never been disappointed with our stays at Palace Resorts, and this stay was no different. ok, so let's get to the point... the pros and cons (in my opinion, of course). The Pros: 1.

The Playacar Palace is located right on the beach, the grounds are big enough to have a swimming pool, lots of areas for sunning, lots of places with great views of the ocean... and best of all, you are literally a 5 minute walk from 5th Ave and the ferry.

The room was clean, the decor modern and relaxing, and the bed linens were fantastic. But the best part of the room was the HUGE patio with the amazing ocean view. We fell asleep to and woke up to the sound of crashing waves. aaaaah... paradise!! The patio had two lounge chairs, a small table and two chairs. 3. The breakfast and lunch buffets were very good. We especially liked the breakfasts with the made-to-order omelets, tons of fresh fruit (the mango was awesome!), fresh juices, and breads and pastries. At lunch, you can get grilled meats (burgers, hot dogs, chicken breasts, steaks, shrimp, etc), pasta, nachos (my favorite!), fresh fruit... just lots of variety and yumminess. 4. The beach - I know a lot of people have already posted about how small the beach was, and it was small, but the water was so warm and clear... it was just a perfect place to take a dip... and it was just steps away from the pool! It's definitely not a beach for body surfing or boogie boarding, but if you just like to bob around in the warm water, then you'll love it. The yellow flag was up for most of our vacation, but on the last morning, the red flag was up and the waves were pretty rough. There was no beach that day, the waves were crashing up right against the storm wall, so it varies day to day whether you'll have a small beach or no beach. I'll still list the beach as a \"pro\" to the resort b/c of the warm, clear waters and it's (very) close proximity to the hotel. 5. The staff - As always, the staff at PP was wonderful. Leo, the activities coordinator gets an A+ for effort! He was poolside every day, organizing pool games, ocean volleyball, and salsa lessons. Everyone looked like they were having a great time. The waitstaff in the restaurants were wonderful, requests were always filled and were often responded with \"it's my pleasure.\" I just can't say enough good things about the staff. The Cons: 1. Dinner - although breakfast and lunch were good, I found the dinners to be less satisfying. Presentation was great, but the food was just average. I did like the lasagna at the Italian restaurant though. 2. Construction noise by the pool. I feel bad listing this as a con considering they were trying to fix the slippery surface by the pool, but for the first 3 days of our vacation, they were working on creating grooves in the concrete by the pool to make it less slippery. But the equipment they were using was really loud and when you're trying to relax poolside, the last thing you want to hear is grooves being cut into concrete. 3. The pool - I thought it was small, but the hotel is not one of those large sprawling resorts, so there really isn't room for a bigger pool. It would have been nice to be able to swim (rather than just wade around) in it though. It was also pretty shallow, an extra foot of depth would have been nice. Overall, the Playacar Palace's greatest assets are its location and its staff. If I were to visit Playa again, I'd definitely stay there again. We also took the ferry ($10 one way, 30 minutes) to Cozumel Palace and had lunch there (another good lunch- they have make-your-own pizzas there which were good) and went snorkeling there. No need to pay for a snorkeling trip, when you can snorkel for free there. Use the ladder to get in the water, the ramp was hard to use, easy to get knocked over. There were tons of fish in the water. As soon as I stuck my face in the water, I was looking straight into the faces of at least a few dozen fish. A little startling, but very cool. :-) We also rented scooters and explored Cozumel. It takes about 2 1/2 hours to scooter around the island. We only made it about a fifth of the way before we succumbed to the heat. I know, we're wimps. We also did the Tulum Express tour that was included with our package. Nice informative tour, and I liked that it was only a 1/2 day trip (8:30 - 2:00pm). It was blazing hot out there though, so don't forget totake some bottled water, sunscreen, and a hat with you. The spa at PP is really nice. It's a 5 minute ride via shuttle bus, but well worth it. The holistic massage was fantastic. The deluxe pedicure was pretty good, the manicure was so-so. Definitely leave some extra time to use the hydrotherapy room, it's well worth it.", "Date": "May 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prospect, Kentucky, USA", "Title": "\u201cBoutique Resort Feel - Oh, and yes, the Beach is Small\u201d", "Author": "Willowcreek11", "ReviewID": "UR7696687", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Playcar Palace from for a long weekend in May. We have previously stayed at the Moon Palace a couple of years ago and have visited Sandals resorts in Jamaica and St. Lucia. We can easily state that the Palace Resorts are superior to Sandals in both quality and value. The Playacar Palace is no exception. This resort is much smaller than the Moon Palace and provides a boutique-feel in comparison to big all-inclusive compounds that seem to be the rage today. The service and friendliness of the staff could not have been better. If you are looking for an exclusive experience with the simplicity of an all-inclusive, the Palace will not disappoint. The rooms were of simple modern design, without the Technicolor nightmarish colors seen in other resorts. The beds, linens, interior fixtures and finishes were of the highest quality. We stayed on the 4th floor along the southern side of the building. We had a beautiful view of the ocean and side was very quiet. The food quality is very good for an all-inclusive and the drinks were outstanding with top-shelf liquors. This resort is not for young couples wanting to dance and party or families with kids. The shopping next door was the best I have seen in resort towns and the streets were lined with small cantinas and restaurants. As you have probably read, the pool surface is very slippery because of the polished concrete surface. While we were there, the resort was in the process of grinding the surface with ridges to eliminate the threat (should be completed in a couple of weeks). I was out in the evening and was impressed by the security patrols throughout the resort. We had accidentally left our room door ajar and security knocked to check on us and advised us to close the door. We never felt unsafe either inside of outside of the resort. The road vendors in the city were not as aggressive as you will find in many resort towns and there was a heavy police parole presence. I would feel comfortable if my wife wanted to run into town be herself. As for the people who were whining about the lack of beach space...get over it! There is still a couple of small beach areas if you want to lay out. But I'm sure that the Palace Resorts were more concerned about getting their resorts reopened and not changing their websites. Also, if you couldn't figure out that the beach is small from the other reviews in this site, then you probably were the same person who was surprised when you didn't get that inheritance payout from the exiled Nigerian Prince you emailed your bank account information.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "jkdh", "ReviewID": "UR7682649", "Content": "Our time at Playacar Palace was nothing short of breathtaking.

We visted Xpu-Ha Palace, Adventura Palace, and Cozumel Place. Xpu-Ha has an amazing beach that they take you to on a short bus ride because theirs was wiped out in the hurricane... I highly recommend going to this beach and spending time at this palace resort because of all the nature and different feel it gives. Adventura was too big for my husband and I. We didn't feel comforable there. It was fun going over to Cozumel Palace, but not somewhere we wanted to spend our entire day, however they do have snorkeling included. That is the wonderful thing about the palace resorts... you can go to any palace resorts and use their food, drinks, snorkeling.. anything with your palace bracelet. We were able to chose two trips to go on which were included in our stay. We only chose one because we didn't want to be away from the resort too long. We went on the Tulum express. It was great because it was a half day trip, but we were still able to learn a lot about the Mayan Culture and look at some very interesting ruins. We were upgraded to the honeymoon suite the second day of our honeymoon. This was amazing. Our room was 243. We could not say enough good things about this room. It was only an additional 24 dollars a night and it gave a bigger bedroom, a family room, and a much larger balcony with amazing views. We started in room 525 on the fifth floor which had an amazing view. I would highly recommend this room as well. When you eat at the buffett ask for Lorenzo to be your server, he is so much fun!

We liked the food, spring rolls in the Asian restaurant were a favorite.

No one ever emailed us or said a word about prepaying, and I had emailed the hotel several times for different reasons. We would have gladly prepayed if we were just asked to. We asked to talk to management but she was a total dead end. We were just told no, sorry. In my opinion after spending thousands of dollars they could have at least offered us 1 free tour. That was the only negative thing to happen, so just beware and maybe contact Playacar to ask if you should prepay. We did see 3 people slip and fall around the pool area.

This was really nice the first few days, when we wanted quiet solo time relaxing in the sun! We had a fabulous view of the ocean, as the honeymoon suites are off on one end of the hotel and closer to the water. We felt the extra money we spent on the room was well worth it. During the first week of our stay, the hotel was at 100% capacity. The second week it was at about 90% capacity, but we never really noticed this. Never a wait at any of the bars or restaurants, and new drinks were always served to us before we were out of the ones in hand! The entire staff treated us like we were the only people at the resort! The pool was busy and there were some people who would go down and put towels on the best lounge charis at 6am and not return until 9am, but even then we were still able to find a spot. The waitstaff at the pool was fantastic, always coming around to take drink & food orders. There is not much of a beach, but it didn't bother us. What is there is very clean and not rocky. We rented waverunners twice from the man near the ferry dock, that was a lot of fun. $50/person for 30 minutes. The food at the hotel was pretty good. We are from the Chicago area, with fantastic restaurant around every corner. Of course the food wasn't like home, but there was always a lot to choose from and it really wasn't bad at all. The buffet had a lot of variety at every meal, and has great cuts of meat in the evening. They will prepare it while you wait, my husband did this many nights. He liked the flank steak or filet, which they seasoned with garlic, herbs, wine and who knows what else! The Italian restaurant was good as well, we liked the mahi mahi and some of the pasta dishes with seafood. Try the white wine from Brazil, it was great! We ate at the Asian restaurant once, it was probably our least favorite. Appetizers good but the main dishes so so. We never got sick from any of the food. I have a very sensitive stomach and I was completely OK! We loved the location of the hotel, such a short walk to 5th Ave shopping, dining and bars.

We booked because we loved our trip to Xpu-Ha Palace five years ago... and were delighted to find that the Palace Resorts lived up their TripAdvisor reviews and our memories. CHECK-IN After a nightmarish transfer (our transfer company was unbelievably confused because we were splitting our stay between the Playacar Palace and the Cozumel Palace), we were glad to arrive around 5 p.m. and be greeted with cold champagne. Check-in was quick and simple; there were no lines and we were not asked to provide a credit card. THE ROOMS We were traveling with my in-laws and had requested (both by email and through our travel agent/printed itinerary) rooms close to each other, on the highest floor possible, and with full ocean views and balconies (preferably looking at the ferry dock, as suggested by other TripAdvisor members). The hotel was completely full and the only place that they could put us was on the first floor. At first I was upset that they had put us on the ground floor (I had read on TA that these had no balconies and looked at adjacent properties) and I tried to discuss it with the front desk staff. They could not do anything, were nice but firm, and offered to put us on the list for a room change (we were there four nights and they thought they could move us on night 3). I gave up at this point, went to the room--- and I was very, very pleasantly surprised. It was on the ground floor, yes, but it had a full ocean view (see the pics-- the ocean was literally fifteen feet from our balcony), was very private, and was very quiet. My in-laws had 144 and it too was very nice (they were 80% looking straight at the ocean and 20% at the adjacent property's beach and balcony area). Lesson learned: look at the room first and/or ask the front desk about specific amenities that you want it to have (such as the full balcony, ocean view, etc.) There are absolutely some first floor rooms that either look out onto the adjacent property or do not have full balconies; there are also some that are lovely. ROOM 142 The room looked like the website pictures. It was on the first floor, had a full balcony, two double beds, and a small jacuzzi (not the double person jacuzzi my in-laws had in 144). The room was situated directly between two of the honeymoon suites (much to our amusement and probably to the honeymooners' chagrin, as we proceeded to decorate our porch with sand toys and swimsuits). It was literally about 15 feet from the ocean: the first two nights, when the surf was high and it was windy, the waves were breaking and the spray was landing feet from our balcony. We loved it: we could hear the crash of the waves even with the doors closed. The only other sounds were the horns of the ferries that blow when the ferries arrive and depart. There was no noise from the pool, the bars, the neighbors or the resort next door. One minor drawback was that one of the double-beds was inches from the jacuzzi and there was no splash guard on that side. We brushed our teeth with the water (it's supposed to be purified) and we were all fine. KIDS CLUB We used the kids club for just a couple of hours total: it is geared towards the younger set (we have a 6 and 8 year-old and they were very happy). There are lots of brightly colored little chairs, pinatas, a giant connect-four set, etc. The club posted a schedule of daily events on the door and-- unlike some other kids' clubs-- stuck to them. The caregivers were lots of fun and will watch the kids from 7 to 9 pm as well (they were showing Barnyard the one night we went and fed the kids pizza), so you could go to dinner without your kids. BARS There are drink menus available at the bar (if you're like me and don't really know what you want until you've read a description). there was an alcoholic and a non-alcoholic drink of the day. They would come around poolside in the mornings with trays of the non-alcoholic drinks and water, which my kids loved. POOL The pool was nice, but a bit on the cold side. Chairs could be hard to come by, but you certainly didn't have to get up at 6 a.m. to \"save\" seats. The hotel was very generous with the towels-- no towel card required and you couldsign out as many as you want. If you returned them later in the day and the attendant wasn't there, he'd leave the book out for you to cross your name out in. Frankly, I don't think they checked. Housekeeping would take the dirty pool towels from our room and no one ever asked us to account for all of the towels that we borrowed. The swim-up bar was almost deserted. There were lots and lots of kids (we were there during President's Day week with ours on school break). The playmakers were low key, as was the music. I was occasionally asked if I wanted to join in something, but all it took was a single \"No.\" They also did a great job of getting the kids to play water basketball and the like. Pool side drink service was the best I've seen: generally, someone was asking me if I wanted a drink within 5-10 minutes of my sitting down (and without my making eye contact) and the drink arrived ten minutes after I requested it (we've had problems at some AIs with the orders getting taken promptly and then just sort of disappearing into the ether). The servers were also happy to bring you snacks or you could get a \"to go\" box from the buffet. FOOD. Overall, it was very good to excellent. The plating in the a la carte restuarants was spectacular. A very nice (included) wine list was available and they were happy to accommodate any and all requests. We never had to wait more than 2-3 minutes and we dined between 6:00 and 7:00 every night. Some observations: \u2022They had an amazing buffet. The breakfast buffet had four different kinds of fresh doughnuts, lots of fresh cooking stations (average wait was 1-4 minutes) with pancakes, waffles, omelettes and the like. There were also lots of hot trays with other breakfast items and Mexican food. \u2022Plenty of non-sliced fruit was available at breakfast, although not always at lunch (bananas, apples, grapes, etc.). This is great when you are traveling with kids. \u2022The resort was happy to provide a to-go box and plastic silverware upon request (this was not a place that yelled at you for removing a banana from the restaurant). You could take the food out by the pool, to your room, or wherever you wanted. I've stayed at AIs where you were literally screamed at for removing food from the restaurants-- not here! \u2022We often had musical groups playing at breakfast, lunch or dinner buffets. \u2022There was always an excellent selection of Mexican antojitos. \u2022We ate at the Italian restuarant one night and loved it: a lovely selection of sea foods, lamb, and beef (no lobster, but lots of shrimp, mussels, calimari, and scallops). \u2022The a la carte restuarants had children's menus (the same one for all of the restaurants: quesadillas, burgers, pasta, etc. with an option for ice cream for dessert, although our kids ate the adult desserts). Room service: we only ordered the breakfasts, using the door cards. It always came promptly. We have learned, over the years, to be very specific (coffee with cream and white sugar, for example, instead of just coffee) and preferrably in Spanish. We had the same room service waiter when we ordered and he always checked the order against the original card to make sure that everything was there. The card also invited you to write in anything else you wanted and that they \"would try.\" We requested and received chocolate milk this way. CUSTOMER SERVICE Wow. It was all good, across the board, but the best came four nights after we checked out. We were returning from the Cozumel Palace to the airport and our transfer company completely screwed up our transfers. I walked up to the Playacar Palace from the ferry dock, explained our issue getting from the Cozumel Palace to the airport, and the bellman promptly took me to the customer service lady who got the transfer company there in fifteen minutes. At this point, we had no wrist bands and they had only our word that we were coming from CP. The bellman had no problem with our using the restrooms, invited us to visit the bar for a drink, and loaded our luggage into the van when the transfer came. Needless to say, that (combined with the Cozumel Palace's own valiant efforts to straighten out the transfers on their end) left an excellent taste in our mouths and we will certainly be returning. To respond to some of the other comments that we've read on TA: \u2022We never received a timeshare/vacation club pitch. I think they might have left a messge-- our phone was blinking-- but we ignored it ;) \u2022We did tip and hopefully did so generously. We did not see a great many other people doing so. I don't believe it made a huge difference in service (we did tend to get vigorously invited back by our servers, even after dealing with us all and seeing the mess we tended to leave behind). \u2022Did we miss the beach? It's hard to say. I would love for the Playacar Palace to have a mile-long stretch of empty white sand in front of it-- but, obviously, that's not going to happen. It is a 2-3 minute walk to the wide beach on the other side of the ferry dock and that is quite nice. There are lots of beach bars where you can rent loungers; we just sat on the sand (on a purloined Palace pool towel) and watched our kids jump in the waves. There is a lovely plaza there, with vendors selling local snacks and lots of souvenirs. It is a \"busy\" beach, though, so more of a beach for people-watching and swimming than long, quiet romantic walks (since we had our kids with us, no loss there). The \"lack\" of a beach wouldn't stop me from returning; perhaps at some point, they'll run shuttles down to the new Tulum Palace they're building. Some of our favorite things: \u2022the giant chess set \u2022getting desserts to go and eating them on the balcony \u2022 turn-down service: housekeeping would come by in the evening and replace your wet towels with clean ones. \u2022the minibar is stocked daily. the resort binder specifically invites you to call if you need a refill on anything. this was one of the most generous resorts we'd ever stayed at: I believe they meant this wholeheartedly. \u2022they played Texas Hold-Em once or twice a week for fun (around 3:30-4:00 near the pool bar) Tips: \u2022There are full-sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner provided. These are Biosilk. they also included a bottle of anti-frizz serum and a full-sized bottle of lotion. Plenty of bubble bath was provided for the jacuzzi (hint: no more than a dime-sized portion of bubble bath is needed!) \u2022Bathroom floors near the pool are VERY slippery, especially inside the toilet stalls. even knowing that they would be, I almost slipped several times. \u2022Be careful walking into Playa del Carmen. If you go out the main entrance, it is a very pretty but very high and bumpy stone sidewalk. We met one woman whose friend had fallen, sliced her knee open and spent the night at the local hospital. The advantage is that there is a steep ravine to your right that is filled with all sorts of local wildlife: little warthogs, lizards, etc. The kids adored it-- it was like having a mini-zoo a la Xpu-Ha. Just watch your step! \u2022If you head to your right instead of straight when you are ready to leave the resort, you will end up at the bottom of Fifth Avenue in 2 minutes instead of 5 (and you avoid having to choose between walking through a very busy valet parking lot or taking your chances on the \"sidewalk\" that appears to double as a turning lane for buses and other large, impatient vehicles). \u2022Ice cream: there are men selling home-made ice cream from bicycle push carts near the ferry dock. $10 or $15 pesos-- and incredible! \u2022They do a sort of \"high tea\" in the lobby bar around 4 p.m. \u2022If restaurant service is a tad too slow, ask for your dessert to go. Overall, we loved our stay and love the Palace Resorts (no, we don't belong to their vacation club and have no plans to either!). We're looking forward to the Tulum Palace and will enjoy agonizing between that and the Playacar Palace.", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hanover, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat way to spend our 25th\u201d", "Author": "CowboyMN", "ReviewID": "UR7232014", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Playacar Palace March 3rd-10th for our 25th wedding anv. It was a fantastic trip. You cannot stay at a resort that has a better location as far as walking in to Play Del Carmen. We would go every night to walk off dinner, shop and do some people watching. It is literally just a 2 minute walk from the entrance of the hotel. The people of Playa were very friendly and of course would try to sell you something but thats part of the fun. Our favorite guy would use this line. \"C'mon, I just want to rip you off a little\" The resort itself is beautiful once you get past the entrance. Our room was 537 and we were put in that room right from the get go, no playing the room run around for us. The bed was the best we've ever had out of all our trips to Mexico, not to hard and nice soft sheets and pillows. Mini bar was always well stocked and the room was cleaned to spotless condition every day. We loved the jacuzzi and used it 3 times. The view from our balcony was great, nice view of the pool and the ferry dock/ ocean in the distance. The rooms here didn't smell musty at all as some other places we have stayed did, which kind of suprised me what with the jacuzzi in the room. We both thought the food was good. We liked the Japanese the best but the Italian was okay. I thought the portions were actually to large as we could never eat it all. The desserts at the japanese were the best- my favorite was the tempura banana. The buffets were also good but after a week you would start to run out of options. The best part was that you could alway get fresh fish to order. The pool was perfect- nice water temp and not to crowded. The wait staff around the pool was always on top of it, I never had to wait for a drink the whole week. There were usually at least 3 of them walking around taking orders. It appeared to me that they have done something around the pool area to make it less slippery-you could see visible sanded areas. I didn't think it was slippery but I did see a few people kind of catch themselves from falling. When we arrived you could not get down to the ocean/beach without getting wet but by the end of the week there was a nice sand beach. The sand was so soft and the ocean felt great. If you want the sand beach plan your trip around the phases of the moon. Full moon no beach new moon nice beach. Okay are you ready for the only negative? My wife thought the towels were a little scratchy. Also we had to be out of our room 4 hours before our shuttle took us to the airport(not the hotels fault) but were able to use a hospitality room to shower and change- now that room I wouldn't have been happy with so there are some rooms that could be really bad if the place is full. One last note. The people who work at the hotel are the BEST. I'm talking about the little people- maids, hostess, waiters, cooks towel girl. They all go out of their way so you have a great vacation and everything you want. You don't have to tip them but it's the right thing to do. You just spent 3 grand or more on a trip whats a hundred or so more.

The location of the hotel is fantastic--close to shops, restaurants, the ferry dock to Cozumel, etc. We were fortunate enough to have private transportation to the hotel which was a great treat vs. being on a shuttle with multiple stops--our driver even stopped for us to purchase cold Cerveza for our drive! Upon check-in the staff was extremely courteous, David was our bellman and has quite the personality! The first night we had a standard room but were able to upgrade to an oceanview honeymoon suite for the remainder of our stay and it was definetely worth it! We not only had a beautiful view but the room was amazing--complete with a large patio. As you'll read in other reviews, if you're a beach person, the beach has had alot of errosion at this hotel and the beach area is very limited, however, a short walk from the hotel brings you to alot of beach area. The pool is nice with alot of space, however, the pool deck can be very slippery so I recommend wearing sandals whenever you're walking. The staff does a good job of trying to keep the pool deck dry, however, it does get slippery at times. What can I say about the service at the Playacar Palace other than it's absolutely fantastic! Jorge at the check-in desk, Daniel and Santos in the buffet area and all of the others that did such a good job to make our vacation a success! All of the staff is very friendly and accomodating, a definite plus! The food, on the other hand, was somewhat of a disappointment. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night and I expected to have a larger selection of menu choices and the food itself was somewhat bland. The buffet has alot of choices but the food is bland and they seem to have the same dishes over and over again. I didn't have the opportunity to try the Thai appetizers at the Luna Lounge although I did hear great things about their food. The grill at the pool bar is great for burgers, sandwiches and tortilla chips & salsa. I basically lived off of the chips, pico and guac the entire vacation! We didn't have an opportunity to see much of the onsite entertainment, however, we did see the Mexican Show and it was great!

I never noticed it but others had. I like the size and because you have free access to all of the other Palace Resorts. It is totally all-inclusive and the food is good but the three restaurants can be a little repetitive. Even though it is all-inclusive go into town for dinner for a night or two. Also, don't overplan!! They do everything for you, by reading this you are overplanning. It has a walkway connecting the hotel to the town, it is a minute away from the ferry. It has an open lobby and the shuttle to golf course/spa/gym doesn't come as they say it does (walk). For a restaurant in town I would recommend Yax-Che; order the mayan coffee, it has fire :)!! Cozumel ferry is always a rough ride so if you are prone to seasickness bring gravol. The asian restaurant is the best of the three and the rooms are very nice. The golf course at Moon Palace is nicer than Playacar Golf Course, walk down the road to the tennis courts then walk toward the ocean for a nice beach.

It is true they will stick you in a room first that has no view except of buildings - the check in staff tried to say it had an ocean view - you would have to hang off the end of the balcony and twist to see the ocean. They did switch our room the next day to an Ocean View which was wonderful. The staff is extremely courteous - Diana who is in charge of guest services is wonderful I recommend doing the water aerobics in the Ocean it's a lot of fun. Yadira who is a cocktail waitress will take care of you also and is a delight to talk with. The food was fine to my husband - I'm a bit pickier. I could not eat the meat I'm not sure what exactly it was. For the week I pretty much lived off the chips and salsa. Did manage to get some pasta at lunch one day with cheese sauce on it. As my husband says I have a childlike palate and this does not cater to children. Everyone has raved about the Italian restaurant I thought it was terrible. The Asian restaurant had great spring rolls and this was probably my favorite one. I also don't recommend the ferry ride to Cozumel. When they begin by handing out barf bags you know it's going to be rough. Many people were using them. Cozumel was pretty much the same thing as Playa was so don't waste the money for the ferry ride unless you just want to say you went to Cozumel. The fire show is fantastic! The circus show was spectacular and the Mexican Show was very good also. If you are on time constraints at all do not rely on the times that you are going to be transferred. We took the ride to Moon Palace one day - the van picked up 15 people and this was probably a 10 passenger van - they stuffed 5 kids in the back cargo area. Picking up at Moon Palace they were true to Mexican time about 1/2 hour late. Crazy drivers! Would I go back - probably not - wish they had offered an American light beer even for a charge - I got tired of the Dos Eques and limes.

I am shocked by many of the reviews on this website as I read them all before going. The buffet is your best choice. The Italian food place is OK, but the oriental place is down right HORRIBLE. We tried to eat there twice, the first time was OK, the second was a Joke. They try to pass off italian noodles as chinese noodles. The \"fried\" ice cream had a goey outer shell and the ice cream inside was completely melted. I highly doubt they even have an oriental cookbook at this place. The reason the All-Inclusive option is so bad, is because you are right next to the 5th Ave. area of Playa Del Carmen, which is has AMAZING food options. ( I will get to my recommendations later). Needless to say, we ditched the all-inclusive meals after the 2nd day. The resort is BEAUFITUL and very well maintained. We booked a Honeymoon suite (which was only $300 more over a 6 day trip. I believe it is well worth it as you are gaurenteed a ocean view. The pool is very nice and the staff is nice. There is a VERY small beach, but that didn't affect our trip as we sat at the pool and overlooked the ocean. Overall, I would give the hotel a 4 1/2. If they would just get a trained food staff, this could be a 5 star hotel easily. For the money, book at trip at the Eldorado Royale, I went there last year and it was amazing. Food in town: We are Foodies and found some great places to eat if you find the All-inclusive option to be as bad as we did. Babes Noodle House: A Fresh Twist on Thai/Japanese noodle house. Try the Fresh Fruit Margs for only $3.50, they are HUGE and very good. This place is AMAZING for the price, you will not be disappointed. Media Luna: Amazing eclectic Italian. Very affordable (wine list is what you pay in the states at a liquor store). This may have been the best meal we had. 100% Natural: This is a mexican food place that uses only natural ingredients. It was VERY good. We ate there for lunch. It also has a great atmousphere. Would Highly Recommend. All these places are within walking distance of the hotel. Don't be discouraged by this review if you have already booked your trip. The hotel is AMAZING, but know when to call it quites with the All-inclusive food. The town has some great restaurants that won't break the bank. What is $30-$40 more dollars when you have already spent $3000 on a trip for two. It will make you day to have a great meal with a bottle of wine. Also DON'T GO TO COZUMEL. It was a waste of time, the playacar palace is much better than the cozumel palace.

Since we arrived early, I was surprised our room was available right away. Our friends had to wait for theirs to be cleaned. My husband and I were upgraded to a suite. Room 414. (I think it's important to put your room numbers in these reviews.) Our friends got room 417. They were not happy to get 2 double beds but liked the view so stayed with the 2 double beds. The view is worth it. The chair dance in the morning is typical of every resort and cruise ship. You just live with it. It wasn't a big deal to me. We took a taxi to the Aventura for a day and ate dinner at the Italian restaurant. This was the only place I had or saw real pizza in Mexico and it was good. The Aventura Palace Hotel was my first choice but was sold out so we went to the Playacar Palace. I am happy we got the Playacar Palace. There are pros and cons to each but we still got the best. But it was fun to visit the Aventura. I liked the adults only deal. The water in the pool was cold. Too cold to get in except for my husband, a lady who fell into the pool along with her lounge chair and another gentleman who dived in but did not stay in. Wish the pool was warmer. We visited the indoor pool and hot tubs. Again the pool was cold. Hot tub was 100 degrees which is perfect to me. Would be nice if the pools were at least 80 degrees but they weren't. Another day we took the ferry to Cozumel to check out the Cozumel Palace. Very nice hotel. Again the pool was was cold.

We were interested in the Moon Palace but many people told us it was very large and I didn't want to go somewhere during March break that was huge. After many months on Trip Advisor looking at different resorts we decided to book the Playacar Palace. Our stay was from March 9 -16th. My husband and I are in our early 40's and traveled with our 2 children ages 10 & 12. When we were pulling up to the resort it was very plain looking and not that attractive. I was a little worried because the Palace website made this hotel look beautiful. Once entering the resort and looking around we just loved it. The colours of white and cream everywhere was so different then what we have seen before. It did not feel like Mexico. We arrived at 9:30AM so our room was not ready. We walked around the resort and within two hours my 10 year old son knew where everything was. By 1:00PM we were told that our room was ready. We were not given any champagne or wet towel that many guests have commented on this website. Check-in was easy. We were on the first floor. I wanted something much higher but they could not accommodate us. It turned out that the first floor was great and worked out well with children. We were able to sit by the pool and literally be steps away from them. Room: The rooms were the best I have ever been in. The beds and pillows were great. Safe was large and mini bar fully stocked. Shower only had a half door which we thought was odd. The bath products lovely and everything smelled so clean and fresh. In the past we have stayed at resorts with that \"musty smell\". Never had this here. Robes and slippers were provided. Iron, ironing board, dental kit, shampoo, conditioner, razor, body lotions, mouthwash....everything was available to us. Maid service was outstanding. Rooms cleaned every day. At the end of the night it was a joy going to our room. It was truly beautiful. Pool & Beach: There is only one pool and it was perfect for us. I learned from Trip advisor reviews that the floors were slippery. Oh boy they really are. Watch out and alway put your shoes on when getting out of the pool and walking around. Many people were falling. Beach was very tiny but for us it was fine. We are not beach people. Food: There are 3 restaurants. Mexican Buffet, Japanese and the Italian. We went to all 3 and found the Italian to be the best. Be careful when ordering though. At the Italian restaurant they mixed up our orders 3 different times. For example, my husband asked for Veal and he received fish. Staff is wonderful but they either didn't listen well or couldn't understand us. Breakfast and lunch were good. We did not find the selections changed that much though. One thing that did bother us was the plates were set up in the centre by the grill. Very odd place to have them because someone was always asking you to move so they could get a plate. Nacho's/guacomole was good. At the bar outside you could get hot dogs, chips, hamburgers and different sandwiches. Drinks were good and plentiful. Never had to worry about getting a drink. No long line ups and staff always walking around the pool taking your order. Everyday there was a specialty drink and the staff would walk around with trays of that drink for you to try. Entertainment: Entertainment not that great. Fire show by the pool was the best. There was also a circus show and mexican show. The kids enjoyed them but it was okay for us. All shows start at 8:00PM and once they are finished there is really nothing else to do. For us it was fine because the kids were tired after a full day in the sun so we went to bed by 9:30-10:00PM. This is not a party hotel by any means. If you want something quiet to relax and unwind this is the place for you but you could go into Playa Del Carmen for more lively entertainment and dancing. Overall: We really enjoyed our week at the Playacar palace. The staff were kind and helpful. The food and drinks were good and the sleeping accommodation the best. 5th Avenue is minutes away from the entrance and it was fun to walk around but not cheap! We would probably not return with our children because there was not a lot for them to do. The kid's club was very small and was geared more for little tots.

We are both 36 years old and left the two kids behind for a romatic vacation. Having read tons of reviews on trip advisor (a little obsesive in fact) for Cancun and Playa Del Carmen I have to say that Playacar is truly a special place. We were not interested in a bunch of party college kids making loud noise in the middle of the night. This hotel really does cater to a romatic vacation for two. The hotel was also at full capacity but it is true as other reviews have stated, it never seems crowded. Having been on a cruise ship our past THREE vacations that fact coupled with the size of these rooms at Playacar it was a real value. One fear I had in reading a lot of reviews about this hotel was there are a few rooms with a bad view. If you go in late Feb early March as we did because of capacity levels you may find yourself in one. Let me share with you how I avoided that. About one week before our scheduled arrival as other have suggested I called the hotel directly (not the Palace Resorts 800#). Having booked through Bookit.com I wanted to make sure our reservation was scheduled. When I called Mexico it was hard to hear but I did speak with someone at the front desk right away (call during the day, during weekdays when it's fully staffed). I spoke with the gentleman that answered and confirmed my reservation. I then very politly asked him two requests regarding my reservation. #1. I asked for a ocean view room #2. I asked for a room at 2nd floor or higher. His response to me was \"Mr. **** I will ask the manager, we are very booked that week but I will see what we can do.\" I was thinking what you were, that it was a total blow off. Much to my suprise, we arrived around 4PM and sat down at the reservations desk. The attendent already had our reservation form filled out with a room selected. When I asked him what room it was (very anxious at this point) he said it was 533. Not only was it ocean view but it was on the top floor. I highly suggest you try this approach, it was amazing to have the room we did. I also found a lot of info at [-]playa.info In fact I pre-booked our taxi on that site for a direct trip from the airport to the hotel. It was painless and about the same price as any taxi. I didn't want to get put on a taxi bus with multiple people going to multiple hotels. When we got off the plane a man was standing just outside the terminal with a sign with our name on it. He took us right to the hotel. They also picked us up at our hotel, prescheduled. I'm sure you would do just fine with other taxi services but its literally the same price so why not? Another helpful hint, Playacar Palace offers quick access to the town 5th Ave (amazing at night and no cruise ship people like during the day). It is also right at the ferry dock to Cozumel. We took a day trip to Cozumel Palace, ate lunch and used FREE snorkle gear and snorkled right out in front of Cozumel Palace. Cozumel Palace was more crowded it seemed but it's also less money to stay there typically. Plan on another 35-45 minutes to your trip if you have to get your luggage to Cozumel and stay there. The taxis do not pull very clouse to the ferry dock. You need to pay a little Mexican on a bike with a luggage cart $1-2. Also, don't book because of the tours, they all leave EARLY in the day and come back LATE. You can do your own tours with the taxis or other booking places. Keep in mind too that if it's hot (85F or above and humid) and if your like us from a cold climate you won't like it anywhere that isn't by the ocean during the day, it's hot people. Almost each day we also took a morning beech walk, put on your suits, take the shortcut path (1 block) to the ferry dock and just on the other side is a really long beech to walk on and swim. We also never had the need to get any Pesos. We brought $ 200.00, 50 of which were $ 1.00 bills for tipping and some $5s.. Why people don't tip I just can't figure out. I hardly saw anyone tipping. Those little mayans are so sweet, TIP THEM. Lastly the food. The food is very good here, but it is authentic Mexican in the main hall. Sure you can get hamburgers and frys but we had great seafood. My wife and I both got a little sick, no diariah but stomach ache and going frequently. I've been told now from a lot of people that this is really the only negative price you have to pay in Mexico and that your body will adjust after a few trips. I hope so because some day we will be back to Playacar Palace. Take shots of pepto bismal twice a day starting four days ahead of your vacation and keep going all the way through, it coats your stomach and protects you from bacteria. We didn't do this and we would have been better off. We also ONLY ate at the hotel and had bottled water, even for brushing teeth. I highly reccomend this hotel for couples, there is a kids club but not much to do. If you need the constant go go go of a cruise ship with lots of activities stay at Adventura, Moon and the other big ones. We visited Adventura during the day CROWDED. If you like a slower place with the sound of the ocean at night while you sleep, Playacar is the place.", "Date": "March 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina, Sask.", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort - Will go back!\u201d", "Author": "Prarieboy", "ReviewID": "UR6908134", "Content": "Just got back from a great 7 day stay at this resort. After having stayed at Barcelo Resort in the Mayan Riviera on a vacation a couple years ago and being quite disappointed, we were happy that this trip turned out to be a pleasant experience and we would be more than willing to go back again. As many others have posted, the game with the rooms started as soon as we arrived and as a result my initial impression was not good. They put us in a room at the back of the resort with a view of a neighbouring hotel. I had written down details from a posting another traveler had placed on this site about what rooms to avoid, and as such, I was able to politely launch a complaint before we even seen our room, just from seeing the room number and knowing it was a less than desirable location. They avoided my questions about whether my room would be an ocean view with a king size bed. I could also tell from the demeanor of the front desk staff that they were sending us to a room we wouldn't be happy with. I politely asked to speak to the manager, who informed me there was absolutely nothing he could do until the next day, as the hotel was completely full (we arrived on a Friday). I tried to argue this but my gut feeling told me he was being truthful as opposed to the run around the regular staff had given me. He promised to get me a better room the next day. This meant that we had to check out of the room in the AM and wait until afternoon to get assigned a new room but we were willing to take the chance. Since most of the hotel turns over on Friday's, Saturdays and Sundays, we were lucky in that many people checked out on saturday, thus opening up some choice rooms. As promised the next day the manager assigned me a new room and since the hotel was still full, he upgraded us free to a suite on the 5th floor with a stunning ocean/pool view. We couldn't have been happier with the room and the manager scored alot of points in out books for sticking to his word. We were not the only people who had to fight for a room, almost every time I went by the front desk I seen someone complaining about changing rooms. I came to the realization that if the hotel is running full, they put every new guest in a less than desirable room location then rotate them into the good rooms if they complain and as they become available from departing guests. As I mentioned, your luck in this regard may depend on the day you arrive. From this time on, the trip was great. The service here is absolutely outstanding, especially compared to the service at the big resorts like the Barcelo. Staff go out of there way to help you and are very polite. As someone on this site suggested we brought 50 US 1's and this was very helpful, as I wanted to tip just because of the service we received. We attended to the Moon Palace one day for a wedding and were unimpressed with the service there and the sheer size of the resort, although beautilful, turned us off. You had to golf cart it everywhere just to get around it was so huge. We visited the Cozumel Palace another day and loved it - alos a smaller size resort with outstanding snorkeling right off the pool deck area. Food was average although the Italian place impressed us. Avoid the oriental place - although the appetizers were good, the main dishes were terrible concoctions derived from stuff that you would get in the buffet. My wife thinks she also got sick from eating at this restaurant. Two small complaints: Although the resort is small and we like this, it can be a but of a pain when there are groups of guests around the resort who are loud & annoying and you want to aviod being around them. Since the resort is small, it is hard to get away. This could happen anywhere I guess. Secondly, the food was disappointing. We will return to Playacar Palace again. We purposely picked a place close to some action (Playa Del Carmen) so there was a little variety available to you when you got bored of sitting around the pool. THis is what we hated about the Barcelo. YOu are out at a secluded resort and they have you somewhat trapped there. It is very expensive to cab anywhere and can be a long drive. I would really advise anyone travelling to the Mayan Riviera to avoid the resorts south of Playa. YOu are just too far away from anything and in the end all you see is the airport, the ride to the resort and then back again 7 days later. Being in Playa was worth alot of money in itself. Also, having access to all the Palace resorts is great. COzumel Palace is 30 minutes and a $10 ferry away and is just in a breathtaking location with free access!.

As others have noted, this a beautiful contemporary resort with only 300 rooms. the rooms are large with LED TV monitors, and full size hottubs in each room. The service is excellant and always given with a smile. The beds are excellant, bathrooms very contemporary and all services worked all the time. This is a quiet resort although families with small children were present in small numbers. The location is perfect as it is a 2 minutes walk from the Ferry port and the public beaches and shops. Ujnfortunately, the beach was wiped out by the huricain and only if the tide is just right, can you get in the surf from the hotel. But it is only a a short walk to the public beaches on either side of the resort. Since this is part of the Palace chain, you can hop a shuttle or cab and use any of the other Palace resorts in the area. There are only 3 resturants: the buffet, italian and oriental. If you get bored with them, some of the other resorts have 12 specialty resturants. The consierge will help get you a reservation, but you can just walk up to any of the resturans without one if you wish. The buffet is good but the food choices do not change much during the week, although what they have is excellent. The entertainement is not bad for a small resort, but because it is small do not expect some of the big shows seen at the larger resorts. A great change of pace is to spend a day one of the sister resorts, including the nightime show One final comment about their vacation club promotion. It is not a time share, but it is a similar type of presentaton. If you like the area and like the standard of services at this chain, it is probably worth attending. It is simply a pre-payment deal for future vacatons at a nice discount. If you are not sure this is where you want to return frequently, then skip it.

We have stayed at three separate palace resorts (Moon, Aventura, and Playacar) over the last few years, and have enjoyed the experience at each. Basically, we all agreed that we liked the experience at Playacar and would return in the future. We concluded that the resort has several great things going for it. 1. The resort is small. It was easy to navigate around and find family members. 2. Quick access to the ocean and waves. This was our favorite part of the week. We loved playing in the waves. However, if you are looking for a beach, you will need to walk over to the main beach on the other side of the ferry dock. There is no beach at this resort. 3. The ocean front rooms are beautiful. We loved our room, because it was overlooking the water and had a decent sized balcony. 4. As always the staff was so friendly and nice. The wait staff is there to meet your every need. 5. Quick access to shopping. Unlike most of the other Palace resorts, the resort was a two minute walk from TONS of shopping. The 5th Avenue shopping area is quite nice. In fact, we were able to get Starbucks coffee! 6. The pool was warm. Unlike the big monster pools at Moon and Aventura, the pool was warm and the kids did not come of out if shivering. 7. Quick access to the ferry to Cozumel. The ferry dock is a 2 minute walk from the resort. We spent a day at the Cozumel palace to go snorkeling and to enjoy the island. I would recommend spending the $20/person to make the trip. It was a great day! There were some cons, as with most places: 1. The food was average and somewhat limited. There are only three restaurants (buffet, Chinese, and Italian). We would have loved to have more options and more authentic Mexican food. We ended up going over to Cozumel Palace to go to their Mexican restaurant for an evening, because we grew tired of the same choices over and over. Also, a lot of our group did get sick on this trip. This typically does not happen when we go to Palace resorts, but this year it was rather commonplace. 2. The golf course was good, but not worth $200 for a round. All the greens were full of sand and the 9th and 18th holes were absolutely terrible (due to construction). To their credit, they are doing a ton of construction on the course to improve it. I am confident that in a few years the course should improve, but at this point the green fees are a bit steep for the quality of the course. 3. The pool area could use a few more seats and cabanas. Everyday we had to go out and reserve chairs in order to get space and cabanas for the kids. This got old after a while. 4. The housekeeping was a bit inconsistent at times. We had several days where we did not have our soup, bubble bath, and shampoo/conditioner refilled. We had to call down to them to get more. Also, we had several days when they did not get into service our room until after 6 PM. My wife complained when they asked her to complete a survey and the next day they were in our room by 1 PM. 5. The gym is small and located at the golf/spa building. Although they say they offered shuttles every 15 minutes, it got to be a pain shuttling back and forth. I just stopped going due to the inconvenience. Recommendations: 1. Be very specific with the cook staff about how you would like your meat prepared. When we ordered meats from the grill, the meat was so undercooked it was incredible. We love rare stakes, but when the meat is still cold, we draw the line. 2. Check-in for the rooms is not until 3 PM. If your flight gets in earlier, be prepared to wait. 3. Go to Cozumel Palace for a day trip. You can take advantage of the same perks at Playacar, but they have a nice Mexican restaurant. I hope this review helps you.

Overall - if you read on (not taking space by repeating what been said over multiple times in subsequent reviews) I'll put it in this format: 1. We were first timers to this area of Mexico 2. First timers to an all-inclusive 3. Seasoned travelers that tend to stay in higher end hotels and B & B's 4. Come from an area in US that is rich in restaurants, big cities and quaint coastal towns and villages, and plenty of entertainment. Our impressions of the Playacar Palace and the location of Riviera Maya: 1. Playa Del Carmen perfect jump point to beaches, Cozumel and water sports, central location for \"ruin\" trips, adventure tours, water parks (Xcarat & Xel-Ha) and plenty of shopping, night life, beach clubs at 5th Avenue area. Safe, well populated, friendly but not intrusive locals. 2. Playacar Palace - impressionist white and clean. Rooms spacious, well-kept and no complaints here about the half glass shower (put the bath mat down). Jacuzzi great, balconies and views awesome (and ours was a bit obstructed, because we were on the 2nd floor - but it was great). Maid service was excellent - any needs addressed right away, bar kept restocked automatically. Staff were helpful but not intrusive. Definitely available, quick to serve. Room service was excellent, bartenders mix fine drinks, chefs were hospitable, dining service was attentive. Pool bar waitresses very good. Both Japense restaurant and Italian above average and better - satisfying and no great complaints. Bottles of wine a plus. Buffet was bountiful, clean, restocked and multiple selections (fresh salads of all types, soups, breads, hot entrees and sides and desserts). Buffet changes a bit, but between all the selections and anything you wanted grilled(fish, salmon, steaks, chicken, larger sirlons, ribs, chops etc) - you had days and days of choices for breakfast (excellent choices), lunch and dinner. Self-made Bloody Mary's, Mermosoa's and Gelato for your taking! We went to the Cozumel Palace for breakfast and lunch one day and those buffets were three times smaller and not as good or fresh. Entertainment (fire show, mexican dancers and the circus) were great inclusives - for an hours worth of entertainment it was great. The pool area was peaceful and porportionatly sized for the resort (yea get out there with your towels early - really....why do you take those chairs early AM and not appear till mid-afternoon or one or twice for 10 minutes??? Common courtesy is all....) View is awesome, pool is perfect (if your kids are fish and the pool area etc is a biggie - this place might be too sedate and small for you). Side areas for more peace or privacy. Music not loud at all (unlike the Cozumel Palace) and the activites are never an big distraction if you choose to snooze or read. Outdoor lunches timed great between and after breakfast and lunch buffet closing/opening. Ggrilled chicken, burgers, nachos, fajiatas, hot dogs, fries etc was great and also having lunch availablity from the pool bar was an added convenience all afternoon. Nightime was peaceful....great bars, warm winds to enjoy the pool area lit up by light wrapped palm trees with a drink or two. 5th avenue nightlife steps away if falling asleep on the lounge chairs to the ocean waves is not your thing... We had only four full days - so we only took the included Tulum tour - learned the meaning of \"Mexican time\" <<smirk>> - but it was a interesting and confortable trip (8:30am-3:00pm). Little longer than we thought, but that happens with all \"tours\" - it was really good. The tour guide was great, really knowledgable and enthusiastic about the Mayan culture. If you get Rafael (with the walking cane) give the guy a big tip). Glad we did it - I'd recommend it to anyone. My only complaint? I'm not sure was all those guest services staff do standing around those desks - i guess waiting to time-share sell...but the poor Chaza reps could use the help booking all the tours, airport transport etc etc. You'd waste valuable (to you) vaca time in line for one guy who did it all (and believe me....it takes some a looonnnggg time to make/change/add/change again five tees times, four spa appointments, a tour or two when the intenet connections and computer systems are notoriously slow anyway...). Please cross train, employ or get more reps for the peak morning hours, or get a night shift option (please!) it can be maddening! If this happens to you on a bright sunny day....gather up chairs, go get drinks and have a party in the hall way area - you got no choice so V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N! We really like the smallness of the place (not talking size, service or quality) but in the fact that it was not 700-1000 rooms, trams needed, long lines or crowded food areas...the location and quaintess of the Playacar Palace and Playa Del Carmen made these first timers sold on coming back many more times.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City", "Title": "\u201cBetter the second time I stayed there\u201d", "Author": "Happy_on_the_road", "ReviewID": "UR6814185", "Content": "I spent a three day weekend at the Playacar Palace and felt like I was at home.

The Italian restaurant was a true highlight and the buffet was just fine. Pool area slipping seemed more common this trip but hotel staff were putting up signs and moving chairs to the most slippery spots. Hotel has to do something about that. Beach completely disappeared but it is only a five minute walk to Playa del Carmen which has wide beaches and very fun places to have a drink while at the beach. Never a problem for a towel or a lounge at the pool even though the hotel was full. Like last time, I ignored the activities people and most guests did as well - it was sort of sad to see him try. Perfect weekend of rest and relaxtion. I visited the Aventura Palace one day for swimming in their sea water bays - lots of fish - it was great. Service at the beach was fantastic and I always had a drink and then we had a nice late lunch and took a taxi back to Playacar Palace (US$15 each way) and that was fun. Maybe I will try Aventura Palace next time, but I do like the proximity to Playa del Carmen shopping and nighlife that Playacar Palace offers (just outside the door - no taxi) and is the only five star place to offer.

In 2006, we decided to leave the rain and cold of Boston behind and go to Mexico. We picked Playacar Palace resort based on other reviews we read and the beautiful pictures we saw. And let me tell you - this was definitely a right decision! The hotel is located in the heart of a resort town called Playa De Carmen, which pretty much means that you're surrounded by tourists just like you (i.e. it's safe), but you still get the local flavor from the restaurants and street vendors, so you won't feel like you're still in the US. While the resort is pretty small as far as resorts go, it's really a gem! Aside from the picturesque architecture and breathtaking view, you get impeccable service and really good food. If you want to be able to roll around in the sand, this isn't the place, though. The resort has limited beach access - that is not to say it doesn't have ocean, though. You can walk down neat couple of stairs and end up right at the water, where you can swim and play in the sun. Then, walk back up and you end up on tiled poolside with beach chairs, fresh towels and a pool bar. There are 3 restaurants: Italian - the food and service are perfect, try the house wine (they'll call it Mexican, but it's made of CA grapes, and it's delicious!); Asian - this place is a combination of Japanese, Thai and Chinese cousines and it is very good (although don't get the almond chicken, it was pretty darn bland); and finally the Mexican bufet - this place is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner (while the other 2 are for dinner only) and offers a wonderful variety, I guess this restaurant is the epitome of the \"all-inclusives\". There are also several bars that serve appetizers. Our room was absolutely amazing! I believe most of the rooms have an ocean view, but if i were you, I'd be sure to request one. The contemporary design and beachy colors blended together perfectly to provide an illusion of serenity and paradise. Our rooms was cleaned and organized at least twice a day, complete with chocolates on the pillows! Oh, and let's not forget that the room service is available almost 24 hours a day! If you are not big on just laying around the water, you have tons of options of activities. I suggest taking advantage of those. The package we got included several different tours, and we worked with a very nice hotel rep who helped us select and book the trips. My suggestion is that you schedule all your activities as soon as possible - they have limited seating and some are only available on specific days of the week. In the 6 days that we were there, my friend and I went to Chichen-Itza - a site of Mayan ruins that's considered one of the man-made wonders of the world. This was an amazing trip, not just from the historical point of view, but also because the relatively long bus-ride took us into the depths of Mexico, so we were able to taste some of the \"reality\" that local residents are facing there on everyday basis. We also went snorkling, horseback riding and parasailing - all very much worth it and fun! And the ferry to Cozumel is walking distance from the hotel. I guess this is it - all in all, I have to say that this vacation was probably the most relaxing on I've ever taken - I'd go back in a heartbeat! Now, on a more general note - here's a little tips: the trip from the airport to the hotel by taxi should cost $62 or less, not $72.

Having stayed at Moon Palace in 1999 and Xpu-Ha in 2005, we were not impressed with our initial drive up to Playacar. The entrance reminded me of a delivery road, and lobby was nothing like any of the previous Palace properties we have seen. Check-in went quickly, however, after previously requesting a higher level room, we were given a first floor room near the pool area. We insisted on a better location and then had to wait 3 hours for a 4th floor room. That may have been RCI's slip-up as I had made my request with them. We did, however, speak to several Palace Premier members who had similiar experiences with check-in. Amenities: The pool area is adequate at best, for a Palace resort. If you are looking for Moon Palace's and Aventura's pool area, this is not the resort for you. Beach, I am sorry to say, is non existant. We had read several reviews and most said it was there, but small, and perhaps it was. The week we were there, it wasn't. You can, however, walk to the right of the hotel and use a condo's beach, but you won't have use of chairs, or get drink service. This to us is what you should be receiving at a Gold Crown Resort. We were also told the beach erosion is a continuing problem for many of the resorts in the Yucatan. A bummer indeed, as Xpu-Ha had a great beach when we were there in Feb. 05. Spa/Healthclub is a good half-mile walk from the hotel, not a huge problem as they do offer a shuttle every 15 minutes from the lobby starting at 6:00. The gym opens at 7:00 am, and there is rarely anyone there. The room is not large but does have a few treadmills, bikes and eliptocal machines, and some free weights and weight machines. We did not use any spa services, but thet looked quite pricey- $80 for a 25 minute massage for ex. We suppose a health club on site would have been more convenient, but this wasn't a huge deal for us and the 15 minute walk to and from was pleasant. Rooms: Our room was nice, we could have done without the huge juzzuci tub, since the double beds were needed for the kids. Our balcony was great with a view of the ocean and we would push for this, as most rooms have one. Maid service was good, and we called a few times for towels, etc, and they responded very quickly. Food: For an all-inclusive, we would give the resort an 8 out of 10. We preferred the breakfast and lunch buffets were excellent for freshness, variety and quality. Even our picky eater, the girl, could find something. The other two restaurants for dinner were good, but not outstanding. We do however, recommend the Spanish coffee preparation done tableside. The pool grill had decent burgers and sandwiches prepared quickly, and the outdoor faijitas were also quite tasty. Service: The employees at Playacar were great. It was obvious they wanted to keep all their guests happy and always were pleasant and quick to respond to your needs. This is the best feature of this resort in our opinion. The poolside activity employees did a fantastic job of keeping our 10 year old feel included in various games and water sports. This is generally not a resort with many kids, of any ages, in our opinion. It may have been we visiting in Mid-Feb., but our experiences with the other Palace resorts in the same time of year proved otherwise. Location: The hotel is situated beside the ferry and a very short walk to 5th Ave. in Playa Del Carmen. We enjoyed strolling the streets after dinner and even had a great dinner, minus the kids, one night at a restaurant called Casa Aqua on 5th. The prices are high, so bargain away, and you may walk away emply handed as they do not come down much in price. Also, get used to saying no to the people making the sales pitches for activities and time share unless you are seriously looking. In conclusion, we did have an enjoyable time at the Playacar Palace. The lack of beach was a major dissapointment for myself, but the rest of the family was okay with that. Luckily, my son did find a few friends and kept busy with the staff most of the time and my daughter hates the sand and was happy to sit on a beach chair looking out on the water. I do not think we will return due to the lack of beach, the lack of families, the all-inclusive fee is quite high if you have kids (my daughter was charged as a full adult even though she didn't drink alcohol). It may be that the resort was just not the right fit for us traveling with kids.", "Date": "February 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London Ontario", "Title": "\u201cSun, Fun and Chocolate Monkeys\u201d", "Author": "Denstedt", "ReviewID": "UR6780503", "Content": "My husband and I just returned on Feb 4 from celebrating our 5th anniversay at this resort. We have travelled to many places on the Mayan Coast and feel this one is one of the best places for service, and location. Don't let the drive up to the resort disuade you, it is not very impressive as it looks like you are entering through a delivery entrance, the hotel is great. The staff is very warm and eager to help you. The hotel is a sea of cream flowing partitions with a comfortable setting for drinks and conversations. You also have a choice of top shelf liquor, for example .. Crown Royal, Absolut Vodka, martinis, and champagne. The resort is small and nicely laid out. The view by the pool is breathtaking. Entertainment: It was a good mix of activities but the best thing was that it started early! It starts at 8:00 pm. Most nights we went into town. Pool: The pool is warm and about 3 - 31/2 ft deep. There are a couple of shallow sections that is great for kids. The swim up bar was never busy, and the staff was always ready to serve you. The service around the pool was outstanding. We had taken our insulated mugs but soon left them in the room as the ladies were very attentive often serving the \"drink of the day\" on trays before you could ask!. Although there was no beach, we did swim in the ocean in front of the hotel You just have to be careful but I would not recommend it for children. Food: The breakfast and lunch buffet was good but I would highly recommend the Italian resturant for dinner. Here you get to chose from a wide selection of food .. and the wine. They have a floor to ceiling wine rack and you chose the wine for your dinner. Room: Our room was fabulous. We had a king size bed with an ocean front view. There was a mini bar in our room tucked into the cabinets with 4 large bottles and mix in the mini fridge. There are bathrobes and slippers for your use. The jacuzzi tub was very relaxing and built for two. They left a bottle of wine in our room so we sat out on the balcony and relaxed. The safety deposit box is free! The shower in a marble walkin shower without a door. The water does flow out a little but just put a towel down and you should be ok. Room Service: A must!!! We ordered it for breakfast and it was hot and on time. I would highly recommend it as well. The town is fun with a mix of local and high end stores. The ferry brings hundred of people into town.

It was exactly what we were looking for in a vacation. We arrived at 8pm exhausted from a long day of traveling. Check in was a breeze and they took our luggage straight to our room. I spent the first few minutes just standing on our balcony and staring at the wonderful view of the ocean and Cozumel island. What a great way to relax and unwind from a long day. The room was as I expected. There were adequate drawers and closet space to unpack into. I brought some hangars from home though and was glad that I had. The jacuzzi was spacious and gently sloped which made it very nice to relax in. The bed was very comfortable and not too hard like I've experienced in the past at other resorts. The only real problem with the room was the shower took some getting used to as it only has a half door. Make sure you put a towel down to catch the water as the floor can be slippery if it gets wet. The food was excellent in all of the restaurants but my favorite was the Italian. If you are lucky enough to be there when the violinist is there playing you are in for a treat. We ate there four times but the violinist was only there twice. I am not sure what his scheule was. Service was excellent as everyone else has mentioned. The only break in perfection was the first few days we were there it was tough to get a drink refill. You had to ask for more instead of it being automatic and still sometimes wait. We filled out a comment card and immediately the beverage service picked up and the rest of the two weeks it was flawless. The pool side beverage service was excellent. Every 10-15 minutes someone was by offering a refill. On only two days while we were there was there a beach and it was only a small one. It was only a brief walk to get to a beach but if you are looking for one right in front of the hotel this will not work for you. I only made it to a few of the shows but really enjoyed the drum show outside and casino night inside was an absolute blast. You can get up a fun time with people at night but this hotel is not a party hotel. It is a short walk to 5th avenue with all of it's shopping during the day and it's very active night life. A word of warning: as others have posted it is very slippery by the pool when it is wet.

A LOT of research was put into this trip and we chose the PP based on its location and the fact that it was a smaller, more intimate resort. We were overall very satisfied with only a few issues, here and there. We booked with CheapCaribbean.com and did not have any problems with them. Airport transportation worked out fine. Rooms: First of all, I had put much effort in trying to get a room on a high floor. Of course what floor do we end up on? The first. I did make a fuss at first, but our view was amazing and our room was very secluded which was very nice. We did not end up with one of the new flat screens which everyone had and we did have a few issues with our jacuzzi. The room itself was very large, had plenty of storage, a safe, a great mini-bar that was kept well-stocked, and an amazing bathroom. Great water pressure and amenities that many have already spoke of. Seriously ladies, save some valuable packing room and leave yours at home! Service: The service, as many have already raved about, it simply amazing. Everyone is so nice and goes the extra mile to make sure you are happy. Everything is followed up with a phone call to make sure you are satisfied. Restaurant, bar, and pool service all were great. Make sure to tip. They do that expect it, which is nice to see, but certainly deserve it. Pool: Gorgeous pool with plenty of chairs. Yes, it is VERY slippery around the pool. Please wear footwear at all times. Make sure to check out the pool bar! Beach: No beach at all. Yes, I knew what to expect when I booked, so there are no complaints from me. You can still swim in the ocean in front of the resort, which is nice. Entertainment: The entertainment staff try so hard to engage people in games etc. People never seemed to be interested, and I ended up feeling really bad for them. One night we checked out the magic show, which was actually really fun. Food: Food is average to great in some areas. The Italian restaurant is very good AND you can order bottles of wine here which is great. Oriental restaurant was okay and the buffet was a little less that average. Breakfast every morning at the buffet was very good and we found room service to be above average. Yes, they have a small menu, but what they do have is great. Room service lost our ticket one afternoon but after a phone call, the situation was remedied. We checked out 5th ave one night and one day which is a must do. Mostly shops, bars etc., but great people watching. Instead of doing the tours that were included, we chose to do a tour with Bonnie and Eduardo's company, Edventure tours. If anyone is thinking of doing this, you MUST! It was truly amazing and one of the best days of our lives. Suggestions for PP: They definitely need to add another restaurant. Also, I think apps should be served in the lobby bar. It is such a beautiful bar and it would be lovely to enjoy some food in it. Also, they should install screens on all sliders out to the balconies. We ended up with many bugs in our room. Other than that, we were told that the resort was at 85% occupancy, but I feel like no one was there. If you are looking for a rowdy place, this is not it! If you want a relaxing vacation in a beautiful location with great service, than this is it!

(But no Moon Palace)\u201d", "Author": "Neuroelf", "ReviewID": "UR6710095", "Content": "Our family just returned from a week at the Playcar Palace 1/18/07-1/25/07. We are Palace Premier members and have stayed at, or visited, numerous Palace Resort properties in the past. This was our first experience at the Playacar Palace. First the positives: 1)Location, location, location. The resort is on the ocean right next door to the Cozumel Ferry dock. It is a short walk down a nice stone path to Playa del Carmen's famed Fifth Avenue outdoor flea market. Walk down the path the other way and you are on the public Play del Carmen beach. Xcaret is a 10 minute (115 peso) cab ride away. 2) The rooms are clean, large and minimalisticly modern. As Palace Premier members, we stayed in a 2 bedroom Presidential Suite (419-418) with a balcony overlooking the pool and turquoise sea. There is nothing better than relaxing after a hot shower, in a Palace resort robe, with a drink, looking out on that gorgeous water. The cruise ships docked at Cozumel are readily visible, as are the incoming and outgoing Ferry boats. The rooms have updated marble bathrooms/showers equipped with high end Biosilk toiletries. Each room has a hot tub. A Presidential suite is two rooms connected by a living room which has a bar, TV, fridge,common dining table. We put a roll away bed in there with plenty of room left to hang out. 3) The service: Perfect from Housekeeping to the maitre-de's. 4) All inclusive. This really works for our family. Food, drinks, tours and airport transfers were all included. 5) The nighttime entertainment has improved tremendously. I recommend the poolside fire show and the Circus show. 6) Playacar Golf Course only a 5 minute ride away. The not so positives: (Although I am a member, and a big fan of Palace resorts, there is always room for improvement....) 1) NO BEACH. The hotel can't be held accountable for mother nature, but please be aware that THERE IS NO BEACH!. The steps from pool to beach lead one right into the surf. You can walk south though the water to the beach at the condo next door, or take the path to the Playa del carmen public beach just to the north. 2) The pool is more than adequate for a 200 room hotel, but lets face it, it's no Moon Palace. My wife compared it to a Howard Johnson's. Some in our party took the free shuttle to the Moon Palace to be awed by the pool there. 3) The food. Although the food, particularly the baking, has improved tremendously compared to past visits to Palace resorts, it remains repetitive. This was particularly noticeable at the Playacar Palace which has only three restaurants, compared to twice that many at the Moon Palace. The Italian and Asian restaurant staffs however get high praise for accomodating our special requests. I particulary recommend the Shezuan fish follwed by Tempura Ice cream for dessert! We could not help but chuckle each night when the hostess at the buffet, after seating us, proudly informed us: \"Tonight we have a Mexican Buffet\", as if there was a special theme just for that evening. In fact, it was essentially the same food on the buffet night after night. Poolside dining was actually quite good! 4) Tea time. We were expecting afternoon lobby spreads similar to the international wine and cheese tastings offered at the Moon Palace. Tea time at the Playacar Palace was just 2 or three trays of repetitive pastries/ and hor oeuvres. 5) Lobby staff/Chaza travel. This complaint applies to any and all Palace resorts. Although tours are free, they must be booked through the Chaza travel rep in the lobby. The lobby desks are staffed by 2 \"guest service\" reps, 1 Chaza travel rep, and a concierge. The Guest service reps have only one purpose; to get you to take the membership tour. They must sign up people in order to qualify for bonuses. They are polite, but persistent. They are useless in terms of providing any other \"Guest Service\". The concierge is also useless. We asked her to arrange a birthday cake with a candle for our daughter. She told us we had to go out and buy our own candle. She could arrange a cake, but we would be charged for it (at an all inclusive resort!!).I'm sorry, but a birthday candle should NOT pose a challege to a concierge at a luxury resort. We have since learned to go lower in the chain of command, not higher, to get things done at Palace Resorts. The Matre de/wait staff at the Asian restaurant were VERY accommodating and had no problem finding a candle and complimentary birthday cake. There were rewarded appropriately in pesos. The concierge however was usesless. That leaves us with the Chaza rep, who was quite competent, but also quite busy. One Chaza rep is simply insufficient for 400 guests.My advice to Palace resorts: CROSS TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE!!! You have 4 employees sitting in front of computer screens who can all access the same info! Why is it that three of the 4 spend most of the day DOING NOTHING, while the Chaza rep is overwelmed? 6) Spa/Gym: Nothing bad to say about the facilites themselves, they are actually quite nice. The problem is, they are a 5 minute van ride away , and the van runs evety 15 - 20 mintes. (They tell you every 10 min, but don't believe it.). When I'm spending $2800 per room for a vacation, I want to take an elevator, not a van, to the gym. The last thing I need is another excuse NOT to go to the gym!:) Overall, we had a very positive experience. I'm not clear though on why they get more money for a week at the the Playacar Palace than at the Moon. I'll pick the Moon Palace any day.

Being located steps away from the fifth avenue shopping area is wonderful and it is so nice for an evening walk. The lack of a beach is not a problem... We did actually get to swim at the small hotel beach one day, and there are pretty beaches easily accesible on either side of the hotel. The only thing that wasn't just top notch was the food. For an all inclusive, it was good. I happen to cook alot myself and live in a city full of fabulous restaurants, so I am somewhat tough to please. That said, the buffet has fun choices, breakfast IS great and the sandwiches, guacamole and pico de gallo at the Aqua Cafe are very good. The good aspects mentioned above makeup for the average food. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the people employed there. They are truly glad to be there, and it seems as if they enjoy what they do.

I was with my parents and younger brother, 21, I'm 23. For our family, it was the perfect setup, able to lounge around the pool all day, drinks at the hotel at night, and the town was close enough that we could go out at night, but the hotel was quiet for the nights we chose not to. The food in general was pretty good, ate in the Itallian restaurant the most, and it was very good, especially the presentation of everything (must see the chocolate gondola!). The buffet was great for breakfast, I'm not a big buffet food person, so I would have them make my eggs or waffles or french toast every morning, so it was nice and fresh, same with lunch and dinner I would have them freshly grill chicken or steak. My parents never had any problem finding anything in the actual buffet (my younger brother never made it down, but had room service breakfast where they brought a ton of food, right at the time he had requested). Another favortie was the 24 hour room service where we could order club sandwiches at 3am! The frist day we were there there was a little bit of a beach, they had beach volley ball down the beach to the right a little bit as part of the activites. By the end of the week however, the wind picked up and the ocean was a lot rougher (interesting to watch the ferries trying to make it across!) and the beach dissapeared and was roped off. Half the pool was roped off as well because the water was spraying into the front pool/pool deck, making it even more slippery then usual. My family didn't mind not having a beach, as my mom said, it was the best of both worlds, right on the ocean without the sand. However, when the deck was part closed off, the pool got a bit crowded and they didn't think to bring out extra chairs until later in the day. It definately was a bit of a fight to get chairs. My family was down there after breakfast by 9 every morning, so we didn't have too much of a problem ourselves, but it was a bit rude watching people saving prime seats at 8am, then not occupying them until 11am! They should definately moniter this better. Did see one group remove towels from chairs that had been saved for awhile, good for them! The cocktail service around the pool was great, seemed a waitress would show up before I even knew I wanted a drink. Give them a couple bucks in the morning and they'll be your best friend all day, same with the bartenders. My mom was dissapointed not to have vodka in the room where all the liquor bottles are, so Wilbur, our favorite bartender, would send her up with a big glass of vodka every couple days and a few bottles of tonic! Watch out for the timeshare sell, I know everyone says this. They wanted to book us on our \"included tours\" the first night we got there. So when we finally got around to it, we signed up for the Tulum tour and the Paradise snorkeling, then next they want us to visit Adventura to speak to a \"travel agent\" about all the \"great oppourtunities\" availible with Palace! My dad and brother were enticed by the offer of back rubs and spa money, but my mom and I convinved them to think about it, so we walked away with the tours booked, and no appointment for Adventura. Over the next couple days, we spoke to other guests who did do the sales pitch at another resort, and they were basically held hostage for 4 or 5 hours instead of the 90 minutes they had been told. So its great if you can take advantage of the free tours, then resist the sales spiel. The rooms were very nice, I really liked the white/beige decor with flat screen tv. Me and my brother got a great room on the 4th floor. My parents however, were put on the second floor at first, basically overlooking the pool bar, and were moved after one night to a room on the 3rd floor with a much better view. THis was partly due to the fact my mom wanted a smoking room and those are only on the 2nd or 3rd floor, but the views still were nothing to complain about. So I know this is a long winded review, but you read so many I hope this will help. After leaving, I personally would not have liked staying at any of the larger hotels. When we would drive past I was even overwhelmed by the size. One downside was only having 3 restaurants, but you can't really expect 10 restaurants at a hotel with just over 200 rooms. The size made it nice and quiet and comfortable. You got to know the staff very well who were all extremely friendly (except the towel girls for some reason!) and also got to know other guests.

What a fun trip it was! Our group: my husband and I (mid/late 20s) traveled with my parents (40s), my siblings (16 & 21), his parents (50s), and his sister (24). All age groups had a blast and came home happy and relaxed. I'll sum it up in highs and lows: HIGHS: *Location. WOW. No need to cab anywhere. Next door the 5th Street where you'll find all the shopping, dining, and bars. We were there daily. The Cozumel ferry is right next door and very convenient. While there is no actual resort beach, there is one right beside the resort and another within a 3-5 minute walk. Beaches are not an issue, they're adjacent and sandy. Unbeatable location, no other resort has this to offer. I heard a lot of people suggest Moon Palace when we were booking- I'm SO glad we went with Playacar. Moon is waaaay over by the Cancun airport and definitely not walking distance to anywhere. *Condition. Spotless from top to bottom. It felt clean, well kept, safe, etc. Cleaners did a great job and were very prompt. *Room & amenities. Another WOW. Our room (333- 3rd floor center) was large, great bathroom with walk in shower, and had a good view of both the pool and ocean. Flat screen TV, fridge fully stocked with sodas and beer, enough storage space for all our clothing. Iron, hair dryer, and safe are in the room. *Pool & pool bar. Great service here! There's a swim up bar and waitresses constantly checking up on you. The pool itself isn't large or deep but is sufficient. There are shallow areas all around to lay a pool chair in, very nice. Yes, it's slippery (we watched a woman carted off by wheelchair to a waiting ambulance) but watch your step and it's not such an issue. *Room service. In my opinion, better than the actual dinner! Hamburgers, BLTs, club sandwiches, fries, chips, etc. Very casual easy food. Breakfast room service was the BEST. Lots of choices. Came on time and hot. Very impressive. LOWS: *ROOM ASSIGNMENT process. Good grief. Like many others on here have said, they try to stuff you into the [--] available room upon arrival. Our first room (349- which my siblings eventually ended up in when they checked in 4 hours after us and there were NO available rooms for them to switch to) was junk. No flat screen TV, a view of a neighboring hotel and maybe a glimpse of the ocean if you leaned off the balcony, bathroom not private at all...bad. There were rooms even further down the hall from theirs and I can't imagine how bad those views were (avoid any room number ending in 48, 49, 50, 51+, I guess......) It was like a silly game, and it seemed everyone had to play it to get a better room, as we watched the same scene play out all week. We immediately told our bellboy it wasn't acceptable and were ushered a few rooms down. Still only partial view. He said he had to talk to his manager and would \"get back to us\". After about 20 minutes he returned to take us to our final room. What a WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY! I wish they would just offer a few different price points so you get the room you pay for- someone wanting a bargain can sacrifice views, someone wanting a prime room can pay a bit more. My parents were really unhappy, as they had booked early in the year and specifically requested rooms on the 4th or 5th floor with balconies and unobstructed ocean views. They arrived and were offered 2nd floor rooms with partial ocean views. Not a happy scene. They ended up in a mediocre 3rd floor room, a bit off the main area but their ocean view was pretty. My in laws were offered a 1st floor room far from everything with no view. They complained and were taken to a 4th floor corner room with stunning views. Speak up, be persistent, don\u2019t take no for an answer. They\u2019re used to this. This was the most ridiculous process! *Food. What you would expect at an all inclusive, I suppose. It was good, but not great. The buffet received mixed reviews from our group- half loved it, the other half weren't so impressed (I wasn't among the impressed). We ate dinner at the resort the first 3 nights, and went to restaurants after that. It all tasted the same and pretty mass produced. *Pool chairs. Considering the smaller size of the resort, you'd think they would have enough chairs to go around. However, this was mainly the fault of hoggish guests who would wake at dawn, throw pool towels on 4 or 5 prime chairs with umbrellas, then leave. Some never even returned or only used the chairs for a few hours but kept chairs reserved all day. It was pretty infuriating to try to find a decent spot to lay out at 9 or 10am only to find there were zero chairs available. The resort needs to monitor this better. GENERAL TIPS: *The airport transport service is good (Chaza Travel), use it. Easy to find the representatives upon arrival, quick loading, good service. *Leave your shampoo, conditioner, and lotion at home! I'm very picky about my products and actually preferred the products offered at the resort over my own. I saw a bottle of lotion in a magazine (same kind as given at the resort) for $40! Good stuff. *Random/general- be sure they don't give you ripped money! My mother in law exchanged currency at the resort, only to be denied when she tried to use it at 3 different places- if it is ripped or torn at all, don't take it, you likely won't be able to use it. *Don\u2019t forget you\u2019re in their country. I was so irritated by American tourists I saw who expected everyone to know English! If you don\u2019t know a word of Spanish, invest in an English to Spanish dictionary before going. I speak just basic Spanish and my sister is fluent, it really improved the service we received in shops, restaurants, etc. when the staff saw us at least attempt to communicate in their language. Most of the staff did speak English, but I couldn\u2019t believe the English-speakers who expected everyone to communicate in English.", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNice Place, About What We Excepted\u201d", "Author": "Laybackone", "ReviewID": "UR6527643", "Content": "My wife and I, our 11 year old daughter and 14 year old son stayed at the Playacar Palace from Dec 16th through Dec 30th.

Nineteen of those 36 weeks have been spent at the old Beach (Club) Palace, that had to be tore down and rebuilt after the 2005 hurricanes. We bought a \"Timeshare\" in 1984, from the \"Family\" that now calls themselves \"Palace Resorts\". We choose the PP because we prefer smaller resorts, the Xpa-Ha Palace rooms only accommodated three people, we didn't want to spend the extra time and money to get to and from the Cozumel Palace and the reviews on the Playacar Palace were mostly positive. Check in went rather smooth. Last year at Aventura Spa Palace, they couldn't find our reservation, even though I had a copy, and it took over a hour. However we experienced the same \"room run around\" that others have mentioned. First they tried to put us into one of their worst rooms without a balcony. I knew that even though they said that they were 100% full, that at the time of our check in on Dec. 16th, it could not have been more than 60%.

After talking on his radio for several minutes, he took us to what must of been one of their worst rooms with a balcony. It had a walkout, but it was on the southside over looking a junking area next door and you could not even see the ocean. Of course I said no, several more minutes on the radio and he said that he would have a better room with a balcony, but it might be a couple of hours before it was available. I knew that I would be in the room for two weeks so I was willing to wait. However once I said I was willing to wait, magically a room was available (316). The only negative that I had on the room was that for the four of us, staying two weeks, there was not a lot of room to store stuff. The Jacuzzi took up a lot of the room and in the only dresser, two thirds was taken up by the liquor dispenser and mini-fridge. The room was kept very clean, we always had plenty of towels and they had a number of other toiletries that they replace, if used, everyday (i.e. razors, toothbrushes, mouthwash, etc.). We tipped the maid weekly. The food was good, some very good. We ate a third of the time in each of the dining rooms. After a week it did get a little old, it is true that there is not a lot of variety. This is one reason we don't prefer all-inclusive. For the most part the service was very good. We tipped at all but one meal, couple dollars at breakfast, three to four dollars at lunch and six to eight dollars at dinner. I know it's been said before, but remember that 90% of the people working at the hotel make 6 to 8 dollars per day, for a 10 hour day and work six days per week. We usually ate early, around 6 to 6:15 pm. This is when the service will be best. Most of the time this should not be a problem, the resort is only 60% full or less. However, during the second week, when they were likely 100% full we had terrible service in the Oriental restaurant twice in a row and stopped eating there. We had tours included with our all-inclusive package. Even though we were told that we would have unlimited tours, when we got there that changed to two per week. I have emailed Palace Resorts about this, but have not heard back. The tours they offer for free are limited and even though they would cost you around $50pp if you were to book them elsewhere, they cost Palace Resorts very little. We went to Coba one day, nice and interesting if you like that kind of thing. It's not something you would ever do more than once. However there are two or three stops at other resorts to pickup/drop off people and a long bus ride there and back. Seven hour tour, four and a half hours on the bus. Bring a box or two of food and water. We also went to Tulum with a stop on the way back at Club Tulum (was Club Maeva, new sign went up while we were there). Palace Resorts recently bought this property and by next year (2008), it will likely be called the Tulum Palace, first they have to \"Palacesizeit\" (i.e. Jacuzzi's in every room, etc.). This is by far the best beach that is on a Palace property, but beware of the bugs/flies. This tour had a lot of time on the bus also. I will likely go back and visit again (Tulum) sometime, a beautiful place. We also went to Wet and Wild (owed by \"Mr. Palace\") twice, our fourteen year old didn't go the second time. It does included a lunch ticket, \"Combo 1, 2 or 3\", but bring more food and water. I rented a locker ($5 plus $10 deposit) the first time, but choose not to the second time. Bring your towel cards. It's a cool time for kid's, but if it was not free, I would not go. Just admission is $29pp. Pool okay, but regardless of a previous posting, it is not heated, except by the sun! Beach, there is no beach in front of the resort, but there is some beach south of the resort and a huge beach, just north of the Ferry Dock, no more than 400 yard away. My wife and I walked to the workout facilities everyday, except the four days we went on a tour. There is a bus that runs at least every 30 minutes, but the walk is nice and heaven knows that we could stand to burn the extra calories. They are small, but we got there when they opened at 7am. If you got there at 7:45am (the second week) you had to wait for a machine! We both felt that they should have these facilities at the hotel. Our 11 year old daughter loved the kid's club, the staff was great. She spent two to three hours there almost everyday and would go their every night from 7 to 9:30 pm. They would take them to the nightly entertainment, which she really liked (we didn't go to any, seen most of it over the last 20 years). We allowed her to sign herself in and out. You do need to sign some paper work the first time! A couple of thing the resort did not have, which we felt they should were: some bikes, ping-pong table, pool table and a foosball table. What my wife and I liked best about the hotel was how close it was to downtown Playa Del Carmen/ 5th Avenue. If you take the short cut, it starts only 150 yard from the lobby. We walked it every night after dinner, it's actually clean and a great place to people watch, listen to music, window shop. Having been to the area so many times we are not fazed by the many people trying to sell you things! During the day we also walked up to the \"Chedraui\" (the Mexican Wal-mart) to buy Tequila (cheapest place to buy it and good selection) and oregano. We also walked to the church to drop off a donation of kid's clothes that we bring down every year We felt perfectly safe, just stay on the well traveled streets. There are plenty of \"Tourist Police\" in town. Since I know it will come up I feel I must comment on the \"Timeshare\" sales people. Having bought one our first time to Cancun, I still agree with most people who say don't bother with any of them. If you want to take Palace Resorts up on their offer, make sure you get the most for your time, we were offered free messages for my wife and I, $100 of Palace money and taxi rides to and from either the ASP or Moon Palace, where they do them. Supposedly for a hour of our time, to update us on the \"Improvement\" in our membership (a lie). We go to one of these about very four or five years (went last year at ASP), it always takes two or three hours (throw in another two hours travel time from PP). We didn't go. There has not been a \"Improvement\" they have made over the years that we liked!!!! If you really think this is something for you, and it maybe, some advise, first plan on going to three different one's, we did in 84' and always sleep on it, we did. They may say that it won't be available tomorrow, it will be. And remember over the years your needs may change, the place you're visiting may change or the company you're giving 10 to 20K may change! Last we had transfers through \"Palace Resorts\" Chaza Travel for back to the airport, things went smooth on the way to the hotel. However the ride back to the airport was over a hour late and after much arguing with the Chaza Rep. who showed up at shortly before 8am, he put us on a taxi. The taxi driver made record time on getting us to the airport, however took us to the wrong terminal. Luckily my wife realized this and even though the driver said \"We\" were wrong, he did final listen to one of the porters there. Others in the line to check in, however were not as lucky and had to get a second taxi. Any questions? E-mail me at gd_savage@yahoo.com.

But then again, I have had great times at youth hostels but they don't cost this much. To be honest, even at half the price it's really not worth it, you'd be better off going somewhere else. There are wonderful hotels all over the Mayan Riviera and elsewhere in Mexico, enjoy those instead No doubt the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the location close to the centre of PdC while still quiet is great. But this does not make up for the negative points that are just unacceptable for a hotel of these aspirations: 1. there is no beach to speak of, do you really want to stay at a beach resort that does not have a beach? I mean, NO beach at all. 2. the food in the restaurants, all three of them, is dismal, basically inedible. It is just tasteless cardboard and the wines are too bad for cooking. Breakfast is the worse have ever had in a hotel. Not even fresh orange juice. 3. The roooms, well, 70's Las Vegas decor had more charm. There is a whirlpool, for sure, but its in the middle of the room, next top the bed! The quality of the furnishings is cheap cheap cheap. 4. Taste: the staff had put two apples and grapes in our room upon arrival, but the grapes were alreday half eaten, they had put the left-overs form a previous guest in our room! 5. The pool is crowded with white plastic lounge chairs. 6. the building quality is aweful, everywhere there is concrete sticking out, dirt marks on the walls, etc Essentially, you have the impression that everything, from the floortiles to the orange juice for breakfast to the lounge chairs is of the cheapest quality. I disagree with a previous writer, its not like buying a Mercedes at all, its like buying a big car with lots of metal but 1980's technology under hood.

This was our 6th Palace Resort stay so we are a bit biased, but we were not disappointed despite my concerns going to a \"regular\" hotel (we loved 2 pre-hurricane stays at the Xpu-Ha Palace). My brother's family and my parents were also along, and we all thoroughly enjoyed the rooms, restaurants/food, staff, property, and service. The only downside is the eroding beach, but you can easily walk a few steps to the south for a wider beach. Didn't matter much to us as the lounge chairs on the pool deck abutting the seawall were just as nice - with waitress service passing by every few minutes. Plus, when leaving the pool deck we were in the ocean rather than on the beach. A few minor cons were the scummy seawall (only visible when in the ocean) and a lack of stuff for teens (no pool table, ping pong, foosball, etc.). I mentioned this on the comment card as well as no towel animals in the room. Animals are not a big deal, but kind of missed that from the other Palace hotels. That same night, and for the rest of the stay, we had towel animals in the room. We also had a call back asking for more feedback regarding our concerns of no teen stuff. I'm guessing it won't be long before they clean off the seawall as well. As usual, ask for anything and the staff can usually accomodate - fake \"tequila\" shooters for the family, boogie boards for the surf, etc. As typical for our palace resort trips, we did a lot of day trips to their other Palace hotels - the Moon (free bus), Cozumel Palace (ferry is steps away), & the Xpu-Ha/Club Tulum (took cheap bus from Playa Del Carmen only a block from hotel). We also did the included tour to Ek-Balam (very good) and snorkeled Akumal bay. My wife & I went to the spa for our included stuff (massage, manicure, & pedicure). I squirmed through my first manicure & pedicure, but the gal was very gentle (I'd do it again). Get there an hour early for the hydrotherapy room inlcuded with any spa treatement. Grilled lobster tails at lunch one day, a wine list that includes some French wines, Mayan coffee, staff that knows your names after a couple days, any drink request or creation (I often say \"surprise me\"), call backs after room request to confirm service was received, kind and sincere staff with outstanding service - just a few things that made the week special.

What I can say with absolute clarity is that it was not long enough! We are already planning on returning there within the next 6 months and this time, we will stay for a week. First of all, I should mention that we booked our trip through Worry Free Vacations. While I understand that they are only as good as the people that represent them individually, I was very upset by the fact that we were dropped off initially at the WRONG hotel. Despite the fact that I showed my itinerary to the representative more than once, voicing that I didn't think that they were dropping us off at the right place. And frankly, being left somewhere that you aren't supposed to be in Mexico... after a flight and then a long bus ride... and no food... it was not a good start. So, a big thumbs down to Worry Free Vacations. HOWEVER! Once we realized the error and took a cab over to Playacar Palace, EVERYTHING changed! We were greeted like royalty by smiles and champagne moist towles to wipe our hands with, etc. Total generosity from every angle as far as service goes. When we told them that we were famished and wanted to know where the restaurant was, they walked us there and sat us down to fabulous food, and AMAZING view of the gorgeous ocean and again, a wonderful waiter. After getting our fill, we found our room and it was fantastic. Everything was so \"top of the line\" and I really liked the clean, fresh feel of the hotel. OUR ROOM: Had an incredible view overlooking the pool, which overlooks the ocean. We had our two daughters with us (9 & 11 years old) and they absolutely loved the jacuzzi in the room. Yes... it was a little unconventional to have it in the room; but oddly enough.. I really liked it. Marble, travertine, white on white...everything was so fresh feeling. Also, I was impressed by the products they offered in the room. Everything was \"Biosilk\" and I am hooked! LOVE the hand lotion. Every afternoon (late) when we left the room, we would return with it freshly cleaned and chocolates on the pillow. The maid even set up my daughters teddy bears to look like they were just enjoying themselves as well! :) (Pic included) SERVICE: Um... WOW. Beyond what I would have expected. So kind, warm, generous. It was a quiet weekend and the hotel wasn't full; but I'm thinking they are this way all the time. ALSO, I have never used a \"kids club\" before. But my daughters LOVED the kids club! Alejandra and one other lady (looked to be about 19-22) were always around and were sooo fun that my girls were trying to time everything around when \"kids club\" would be open. They always had something fun planned for the kids, so my hubby and I could squeeze in a little private time of our own. LOCATION: I loved it! It was close to Xcaret, which was something that I totally wanted to do. And it was HANDS DOWN the best thing we did. (more on that later) Also, I loved that there was a private path right from the hotel to the market, where we did some fun shopping. EXCURSIONS: GO - TO - XCARET!!! Parents, don't miss the opportunity to let your kids swim with the dolphins! You will think initially that it is too expensive; but I assure you, it is sooo worth it! An unforgettable chance of a lifetime for your little ones. And you can get a video of their experience for $50 or a pic for $18. We did the hour for $125, which I can't imagine doing less. They got to do so, so many cool things. Also, there are they coolest animals everywhere and they have a private beach area that is fun to hang out in as well. Honestly, I wish we had an extra day just at Xcaret. It is so cool. The show at the end of the day is awesome, too. Don't miss it! A BIT OF ADVICE: DO NOT TALK to the guys at the airport! They are manipulative and before you know it, you will have an appt at some hotel to buy a time share. KEEP WALKING til you get to your bus or whatever. If you want to look at timeshares or vacation clubs, I assure you that they will give you opportunity at your hotel to do so. It's just what they do there. We did get caught at the airport and I was amazed that Playacar Palace actually reimbursed us for the money spent to reserve a spot. REGARDING THE BEACH: Okay... for those who went to this hotel and later complained about the beach, shame on them. OBVIOUSLY there is very little beach here and it has been stated numerous times by other visitors. So, don't be suprised when the beach is small. That being said, I walked 3 min down the beach and there was the larger beach, if I wanted it. Additionally, they have \"sister hotels\" that are minutes away with amazing beaches. So, my advice would be to go to Playacar for all the other reasons that it is fabulous and then go to the other hotels for the beaches, if that is huge for you. We visited other Palace hotels, and while they were all nice, none compared to this...because of it's size. It's small, intimate nature was so much better than the \"mega hotels\" of which there are MANY. Sorry for the LONG commentary; but credit is very, very due here.

This one was one of the best and Trip Advisor was right on target based on the volume of positive comments. Negative comments on this property are always in the minority, usually based on isolated events. We booked our trip through Expedia and then throught the hotel direct, starting on 12/16/2006. Our 20th anniversery was on the 21st and the hotel went beyond the call in recognizing this special event and helping me arrange specific requests without the knowledge of my wife.. Food is usually the major difference at these resorts and there were three great restraunts. The main restraunt cooked food made to order in front of you, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. There was 24 hour room service and food always available by the waiters by the pool, who I might add were ALWAYS bringing drinks to us. The service was top notch everywhere, The pool was exceptional, the room service was consistent, the meal service was extrememly attentive and any calls to the front desk were executued and a return call was made to see if everything was done to our satisfaction. I found eveyone quite responsive and wanting to help. The location was great as it is a 40 minute ride to Cozumel on the ferry, the dock less than 100 yards away. There is the 5th Avenue area to shop and walk. There are 4 other Palace resorts in the area with different personalities. Renting a car provides more freedom, but there is a shuttle with restrictive times. We really liked the Cozumel trip as their hotel their has a snorkleing area and you have the same privaledges (drinks and food) at all resorts. The rooms were very clean and of average size. The decor was mostly new and every room had a two person jaccuzi and most had balconies. Having said that, we switched rooms with ease from a partial ocean view to a magnificient full ocean view overlooking the pool. The 4th/5th floors offer the best views of the resort and the ocean. When we swirched we asked for certain room numbers and they we happy to comply. The best night \"show\" activities were the magic show, the circus show, the fire show. From there the average shows were the carribean and mexican shows. There were 2 other shows we missed. There is always kareoke and teh bar. There is a schedule of pool activities for those inclined on a daily basis. Leo et al handle these duties. If you have kids, there is a \"kids\" corner who entertain the kids throughout the day and for 2 hours at night. Since we do not have kids, I can't tell you everything other than the \"puppet\" show was a great success. Aside from everything above, the weather and relaxation is why we went there mixed with some side trips. There is no beachfront and if you want a beach, you will not get it here. However, there is immediate ocean access. The pool is the place to hang out. (Yes, it is slippery-be careful) There is no business center, but laptops can be rented for $5.00/30 minutes, very reasonable. This resort is more couple oriented to a wide range of age groups. It is not a honeymoon haven, though there were some. I would say that about 30% of visitors are family oriented. But this is based on the time of year we went. You wil not be disappointed by this resort and my wife and I new exactly what to expect which was realized. We would certainly recommend it with a 100% conviction, no doubts. It was an outstanding time and the overall service and food was diverse and very good. If anyone has questions, email me at miked77998@aol.com and mdavila3@comcast.net.

As we were celebrating our 8th anniversary the hotel upgraded our room to a Governor Suite (441) with a huge balcony/terrace overlooking the ocean. Where do I start... the hotel is very stylish, chic and light and airy. I love the way they have used some organic features such as the thatched roof, the use of wooden screens and the huge tree growing up through the lobby area. Rooms: Very contemporary and decorated in shades of cream, beige and white. The furnishings are simple but very effective - especially the under-lit bedside tables! All the amenities you could need with the added bonus of in-room liquor optics. Whilst we were there they installed 32\" LCD TVs in all the rooms - very nice! Food: All the restaurants were great. There's a big selection for breakfast and lunch and the evening buffet at the Cafe del Mar was also very good. The two a la carte restaurants were superb, especially the Italian. Every time we ate there we couldn't get over the stunning decor and the great food. However good an all-inclusive you don't expect this kind of standard! Pool area: The only slight downside about the pool area is the fact that in the winter (end of November) the sun sets behind the hotel and the pool area becomes shaded quite early (about 4pm). As other people have commented, the beach area is small but the water is great for swimming and I liked the fact that you could sunbathe round the pool but were only a couple of steps away from the ocean (I much prefer swimming in the ocean than in pools). Staff & service: Palace Resorts have done a great job - all the staff we came into contact with were fantastic... very professional but friendly and warm at the same time. We had a lot of fun with Yanet - she has a great sense of humour and always made us smile! Location: Unbeatable! 5 minutes walk outside of the hotel and you are in the heart of Playa del Carmen. Again this is very unusual for an all-inclusive and was what sold us the property when deciding where to go. All in all a great little hotel with the added bonus of being able to use the other Palace Resorts facilities (Cozumel Palace is just a short ferry ride away).

But first here are some of the all-inclusive resorts we\u2019ve stayed at, in the Riviera Maya, which we subconsciously used for comparison: El Dorado Seaside Suites; Aventura Spa Palace; RIU Palace Riviera Maya; Xpu-Ha Palace. We stayed in room #242 and feel that this room location was one of the best non-suite locations. Our balcony was less than 10 feet from the waters edge. Rooms 142, 342 and 424 would also be ideal non-suite rooms. Our room was between two (honeymoon) suites, which were numbered 241 and 243. Positives: \u2022 Impeccable service in the restaurants. In our group of four adults, three off us have different wine tastes. Nightly, the waiter had no problem bring out three different bottles of wine to indulge. Waiters were willing to take special menu requests. Hint: In the Italian restaurant ask the waiter for the \u201cchef special\u201d and you\u2019ll get six of the biggest garlic saut\u00e9ed shrimp I\u2019ve ever seen. However, when the table next to us saw the shrimp platter and asked for it, the waiter (same as ours), said it was no longer available. Shortly thereafter he brought a platter of the shrimp to a couple that arrived in the restaurant after the other couple. \u2022 Location\u2014the hotel is literally less than a two-minute walk to the south end of 5th Avenue. \u2022 Staff projected no expectation for tips. Here\u2019s how we tipped: $2 per day to housekeeping; $1 for every three rounds of drinks at the bar(s); $5 per dinner and nothing for breakfast or lunch; $2 for room service. I know that many tip a lot more, but I felt what we gave was adequate and frankly we seemed to be the only ones tipping. \u2022 Room service was very quick--our longest wait was ten minutes. (Hotel occupancy per the Front Desk: 70% full). Compared to the other resorts we\u2019ve stayed at the room service menu offered more selections depending upon the time of day. During the overnight hours the menu is mostly snack/dessert type items. \u2022 Quite and relaxed atmosphere. After 10 pm very few people were meandering about or drinking at the bar(s). If drunken partying is what you\u2019re looking for head to one of the clubs on/near5th Avenue--which we did one night. \u2022 Extremely hot water was never lacking in the shower. I don\u2019t like to iron so when I took a shower (before the evening dinner) I hung my clothes in the bathroom and steamed the wrinkles out\u2014killing two birds with one stone so to speak. Negatives: [I knew the below prior to booking so it was no surprise. But, still a hotel negative nonetheless.] \u2022 Spa & gym not on-site. I\u2019m an avid jogger and it took me approximately 10 minutes to jog to the spa/gym. For longer runs I jogged the sidewalk that encircles the Playacar Golf Course, which was a 50-minute jog. I run an eight-minute mile. \u2022 Only two a\u2019la-carte restaurants with non-changing menus during the week we were there. \u2022 Smaller rooms. Our room was the same size as the room we stayed in at the Aventura Spa Palace. However, they were a 1/3 smaller than the rooms at El Dorado Seaside Suites or RIU Palace Riviera Maya. Again, this was expected since the hotel is not technically a \u201cnew build\u201d just new the Palace family. \u2022 ***Very subjective*** The hotel d\u00e9cor is minimalist with respect to the interior decorating. Consequently, it did not project a very welcoming/warm/cozy feeling, which I like in a smaller hotel. The polar opposite would be RIU Palace Riviera Maya and this is not a smaller hotel by any means. \u2022 Pool: I like a refreshing dip in the pool to cool off but it was darn right cold! \u2022 Towel cards: Why? Sometimes they ask for them, other times they don\u2019t and other times you put your name and room number in a book. On a positive note\u2014We got to the pool area around 9am and were one of the first ones there. Also, during our week there was little to no early morning saving of chairs. \u2022 Pool umbrellas: The hotel should double the amount of what\u2019s available. Specific questions? Feel free to email me at \u201ckiester66@hotmail.com\u201d with \u201cPlayacar Palace\u201d in the subject line.

Seriously\u2026and the VIEW! Good lord. If you're all about partying it up and having a loud drunken time, you wont find that here. My boyfriend wanted to take me someplace for my 40th birthday--you know, so I could drown my sorrows! After much research (most of it here on TA), I chose the Playacar Palace. I wanted a place where I would walk into the room, look out the window and think I was in heaven. That's exactly what happened! We booked online through Liberty Travel [--------] since they were the only ones offering the honeymoon suite. I checked with the hotel directly, and the price was the same so we booked online. The great thing was, the ground transfers to and from the hotel were included...no extra fuss involved in trying to figure that out. When you get through the long process of getting your luggage and being approved through customs, keep walking down the long hall toward the doors. Do NOT stop to talk to anyone offering help--even the help desks are full of time share folks trying to get your time and money. Thankfully our ground transportation company (Olympus Tours) was the last window before the doors outside. Our names were on the list and everything worked like clockwork. These folks even give you some helpful tips for your stay! Very good information right off the bat. The van ride to the hotel is about 45 minutes--can be a little longer depending on how many other couples need dropping off at the hotels in the area. The van is air conditioned and comfortable. Sit in the front bench seat if you can-the driver will rattle off some tips or point out landmarks as you go and I would imagine it can be hard to hear further back. When you check in, you will be handed a glass of champage--signaling that your vacation has finally begun! Unfortunately, just after that you will get a HUGE sales pitch to buy into their time share when you go \"to the side to get more information about the hotel\". There is some good info they give you, so be sure not to say no to it (like a list of the restaurants and the times they\u2019re open, a property map etc)\u2026then tell them firmly you\u2019re NOT interested in the \"90 minute\" presentation\u2014unless of course you are. I think they will give you a free massage at the spa if you do it. Quite frankly, I didn\u2019t want to sit though a half day\u2019s worth of their stuff\u2014which it would be considering the shuttle time back and forth and a tour of whatever they want to show you. We didn\u2019t say no right away and the sales girl \u201cElena\u201d called us a few times in the room. What I didnt know was that a few times she was calling to talk to my boyfriend about setting up a lovely birthday surprise for me! He had them send me a lovely huge bouquet of flowers for my birthday--I was so sad to leave them! I ended up giving them to a gal from NY I met at the pool the day before. Anyway, the phone rang a few times too many so we started ignoring it---afraid it was Elena calling! We finally unplugged it--although I must say a few calls were other guests who had dialed the wrong room. Thankfully we unpluged the phone our first night there\u2014we were exhausted and went to bed by 9pm. The hotel called to \u201cwelcome us\u201d at 9:53pm and we were fast asleep! When I booked the trip, I specifically requested room 441 (one of the honeymoon suites) based on a review I read here. When we checked in, we were given room 241. I nearly complained, but thankfully good reasoning took over and I decided to wait to see what the room looked like first. Our room was perfect!!! I never saw what the other rooms looked like, but the position of our balcony compared to the water was TO DIE FOR. Spend the extra $150 for the week if you have the option. You can always ask for the upgrade when checking in if they have one available. Seriously, we were about 20 feet up off of the water, and about 20 feet back in off the beach. It was unbelivable!! Instead of telling you all the same stuff everyone else has, I will post an email of day-to-day stuff that I sent someone traveling there in February. This is the kind of stuff I would have wanted to know... The best pieces of advice I can give you: 1. Do not EVER walk on the pool deck without shoes. Trust me on this one, no matter how carefully you think you will walk. It is deadly slippery. I fell our first morning there\u2014thankfully right INTO the pool so I was fine. I witnessed someone else falling the next day\u2014and several people were walking around with casts/crutches/wrists bandaged up etc. When I say don\u2019t EVER, I mean, not even 10 feet from the pool to your chair. 2. Don\u2019t bother to go to Cozumel (via ferry, $10 each way) unless you have something specific there you want to see. It\u2019s just like the shopping area down the street from the hotel, but HOTTER and you\u2019ll have to pay to get there, and then wait for the ferry to take you back which can be up to a 2 hour wait! If you go, buy only a one way ticket. There are 2 ferry companies and you'll be stuck on the one if you buy a round trip ticket. You'll be mad if the other one is the one leaving when you want to go back! 3. Take about $100 in singles for tips\u2014for the waiters, bartenders, and especially the folks serving drinks at the pool. 4. Take a whole bottle of Zantac AND Imodium AD. Take a Zantac every morning, and one every evening. Take the Imodium as needed. I have a relatively strong stomach but I am sure glad I had that stuff with me. 5. Take at least 2 swimsuits. We wore hardly any of the shirts we brought\u2014we were in swimsuits almost the entire time. You\u2019ll need just a few shirts, a pair of shorts (or two), and one nice pair of pants/dress. Bring a hat, too and tons of sunscreen. It\u2019s VERY intense and sunscreen is expensive at the hotel-$12/tube. 6. The floor in the rooms is like marble and CAN be slippery too when it\u2019s wet. Be careful around the shower and jacuzzi areas. The bathroom is completely open, with only a smoked glass door on the toilet area, and a half door on the shower area. 7. There are no screens on the sliding doors. It\u2019s nice to leave them open to hear the ocean, but I wouldn\u2019t leave it open all night long. It also creates a hell of a wind when the front door opens! Be careful the door doesn\u2019t slam. 8. Be sure to ask for TWO room keys. Believe it or not, the AC does not run in the room unless the card key is in a slot next to the door on the inside of the room. This is so in theory it doesn\u2019t run all day when you\u2019re out and about. I don\u2019t know about you, but I certainly wanted the room cool when I\u2019d been outside in the heat all day. Simply leave one in the slot while you\u2019re out. That being said, the maid may come in and pull it up to shut the air off anyway. Just push the key back down in the slot when you get back to the room. 9. The pool chairs fill up fast. You\u2019re not supposed to save them and wander off, but everyone does it unfortunately. Be sure to grab chairs near an umbrella as those go really fast. Even if you don\u2019t think you will want use it, you will. Trust me. 10. Order the Miami Vice. \u00bd Pina Colada \u00bd strawberry daiquiri. YUM!!! Of course, starting the morning out with mimosas is not a bad way to go. 11. Every afternoon they start the days \u2018activities\u2019 on the pool deck such as water aerobics, water polo, poker, towel folding etc. They use a microphone to announce this stuff and the speakers are attached to the pool bar. If you don\u2019t want that noise a little bit each day, plop yourself on the far end of the pool deck. 12. Most folks speak fairly decent English\u2014with the exception of the maids possibly. 13. When you call any of the staff on the phone, they always answer and rattle something off in Spanish. Just start talking to them in English and ask for what you need. We could never figure out what they were saying but by the end of the trip just blurted out what we needed and it always worked! 14. You\u2019re supposed to be able to use all the \u2018sister\u2019 Palace hotels, but none of them are really that close and there\u2019s a shuttle to only one of them. We took the ferry to Cozumel and went to the Cozumel Palace and it was nice\u2014we just used the pool and had a drink and lunch on the pool deck. We didn\u2019t go to any of the others. It\u2019s a $3 cab ride from the ferry to the hotel. Pay the $3. We walked without realizing how far it was (doesn\u2019t look that far!)\u2014and we about died from the heat. 15. The \u201cgym\u201d is not on the Playacar Palace property. It is at the Spa down the street and there\u2019s a shuttle that will take you there. If it\u2019s HOT, which it usually is, take the shuttle. It\u2019s a decent walk there. (If you plan on working out). We planned on it, but never got there! 16. If I had to do it over, I would have parasailed or rented a jet ski. You can do both on the beach at the hotel. 17. There isn\u2019t much of a beach to speak of\u2014but you can certainly get in the water all you want. There is some beach though if laying there is your thing. Personally the pool deck was ON the beach, and there was bar service there\u2014who needs to lay on the beach!!?? 18. Be sure to eat lunch by the pool at the pool bar. The cheeseburgers are the best and they'll even put blue cheese on it if you ask. Also get the chips and guacamole! Mix the pico in the guac and you'll not want to stop eating them. 19. You can eat and drink to your hearts content. Room service meals are so-so, but prompt. The buffet restaurant is good, but gets old after several meals there. There is also an Italian and Oriental place\u2014both decent. You're not supposed to wear shorts, but tons of people did. 20 If you visit the Italian restaurant, try the stuffed chicken breast, the caprese appetizer, and the Gondola dessert. YUM!!! 21. Order lots of bottled water for the room\u2026they\u2019ll bring it right up if you call via the Express Service button on the phone. If you make room coffee, make sure to use the bottled water. They say the hotel water is purified through reverse osmosis, but I didn\u2019t care to go that route! We drink a lot of water and made coffee every morning so we were always calling for more! The maids come 2x a day and the fridge restocker guy comes once a day I believe. Here is what\u2019s included in the room: Shampoo and conditioner (spa quality) Soap, of course! Standard issue hair dryer Razor and shaving cream Mouthwash Lotion Cotton balls, Qtips, nail file Shoe polisher thingy Toothbrush and toothpaste Bubble bath for the jacuzzi Terry cloth slippers (to take home, too) Spa quality bathrobes Coffee Pot and \u2018stuff\u2019 (2 pots in Suites) Safe (use it) Each room has a jacuzzi and mini bar/fridge (Honeymoon suite had 2 of these\u20141 in each room). Mini bar has full sized bottles of: Rum Tequila Brandy Vodka Fridge has cans of: Tecate light Dos Equis Mineral Water Water (bottled) Coke Diet Coke Sprite All in all it was an amazing trip and I am very sad to be back home.

The location of this hotel is fabulous. Downtown Playa del Carmen is right out the front door. I was never a fan of the city but I enjoyed it this time. I guess because I knew to barter with vendors and I knew what to expect. It was really nice and I love seeing the real side of Mexico. Everything is very close. The popular Senor Frogs is right next to the hotel but it's not loud. It's a very quiet and relaxing resort. When we first got to the hotel we were of course greeted with champagne. Something we always look forward to when visiting a Palace resort. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel happened in the first 10 minutes of checking in. As soon as we got our room number we were taken over to a couched area with a hotel representive. We have stayed at Palace resorts before so we knew what was coming. SALES PITCH to buy a Palace timeshare. This always annoys me. I know it's important to the hotel to get people to buy but it is the last thing I want to sit through after I've flown 3 hours and driven an hour with 2 kids. I would much prefer that they'd let us get situated in our room and have a quick dip in the pool first. We quickly told the lady that we weren't interested and she called for the bellman. We were then taken to a first floor room. The view was of the pool bar. I've been through this before. They always try and give you one of the \"bad\" rooms. I told them no, I wanted a room with a balcony overlooking the water. The bellman called and they offered us a room overlooking the water but with no balcony. I said no again and the bellman took us to room 421. It was perfect. Do not be afraid to tell them you'd like a new room. They are used to it. I also knew going in that the hotel was only at 35% capacity so moving us wouldn't be a problem. The rooms are great and the bathrooms are so nice. They have plenty of room and this one had an amazing view. It was really nice to wake up and see the view of the water. The electricity in the room only works when you have your key in the holder next to the door. This made the room very warm. We quickly asked for a second key. We would watch from the pool to see when housekeeping came and then we would go up and slide the second room key in. That way our room was nice and cool when we came back from laying out in the 95 degree weather. The pool area is very clean and it was the perfect size. It had a really great pool bar as well. The tile is slick as others have said. I almost lost it twice and I did see one person take a nasty spill. Just walk with shoes/flops and you're fine. There isn't a big beach but it is there. We got in the water and it was crystal clear. No fish though. It's big enough for beach walks but I wouldn't have laid out there. We were traveling with a 10 and 12 year old so we weren't sure if the kids club was going to keep them occupied. We were soooo wrong. I barely saw my kids. Every day we'd get to the pool and the event organizers would come around and grab them all. They even had activities that involved adults. They are a wonderful staff who absolutley love their job. They had organized events like water polo, cocktail demos, Spanish lessons,movie and Xbox nights for the kids, etc. In the evening we watched a fire show and a magic show that we're incredible. We obviously couldn't do a lot of partying with the kids and we thought the nightly entertainment would be \"cheesy\" but it was actually very good. They had a casino night on the last night we were there and it was very fun for both us and the kids. We weren't looking for \"babysitters\" but we did want the kids to stay entertained and they certainly were. I cannot say enough about the entertainment/kids club team. A couple of reviews of the food made me nervous about taking kids to this resort but if people couldn't find something they liked to eat at this resort than they're absolutley crazy. My kids are very picky and they never complained. As a matter of fact, they loved the Italian, Japanesse and Mexican. And the buffets for breakfast and lunch are extensive. I am picky as well and I thought the food was fabulous. My husband both had a hot stone massage at the Playacar Spa. It is a 5 minute drive but you go by shuttle and it's a very pretty ride. The spa is located in a beautiful gated community. It's right across the street from the Riu. I included pictures because my husband and I are very into the spas and I couldn't find any pictures of it online. I was worried about the drive and how nice it would actually be. I felt safe going alone to the spa. They offer a shuttle from the hotel and they come back at the expected time your appointment is over. The spa is gorgeous and the services offered are excellent. My massage room had a view of the water and golf course. Go early or stay after so you can use the reflexology servies that come with whatever service you buy. They have a hot tub, cold tub, cold flush, sauna and steam room. It is so nice! The last thing I want to touch on is the service. It is unbeleiveable. We were treated like absolute royality. Our kids were as well. We would sit at the Aqua Bar at night and the bartenders (Johnny) would remember our names and our drinks. They would give the girls Shirly Temple shots and teach them games and tell them jokes. We really enjoyed that time at the bar because we learned a lot about the employees and everything Palace resorts does for them. Palace teaches them English and their benefits are suppose to be the best around - according to the employees. These people only get paid $8 a day so when you give them a $1 tip for a couple of drinks, it is so appreciated by them. They will go out of their way for you with or without a tip because they love their jobs so much but to see their faces when you give them that dollar is priceless. There was 1 bartender (Johnny) and 1 waiter (Martin) who we would give $10 tips to at the end of the night because they were so amazing with us and the kids. They'd make animals out of stirrers, spiders out of Champagne corks and tell us stories about themselves and ask to hear stories about us. We were sad to leave them. This hotel is perfect.

Our waiter was Marco and he made for a deligtful dinner experience, they even have a violin player there!

My only complaint was that we only stayed there 3 nights!", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!!!\u201d", "Author": "floomper", "ReviewID": "UR5968192", "Content": "It's been a few days since I've been home from my vacation at Playacar Palace and I miss it already. This is my first experience with an all-inclusive vacation and I found it to not only be a great way to vacation from an affordablility standpoint, but the idea of having room service at your beck and call and to be able to pick from a list of tours that are included with your package was an extreme bonus. My friend and I booked through Costco Travel and purchased the airfare separately. I can't say enough good things about the staff in every area, from the pool, to room service, to the restaurant and bar staff. It was the end of the low season so the crowds were non-existant. The food was good. The Italian restaurant had some really good entrees and the breakfast/brunch buffet was incredibly fresh and flavorful, not like the buffets you often see where there are large vats of unknown foods bubbling away. Here, the offerings were presented in shallow dishes, often holding just a handful of servings as to keep them fresh. Everything tasted great. Special note to waiters Eider and Francisco who were quick to clear dishes or offer more beverage of any kind. Usually tried to give us tequila for breakfast more than once. :-) The exceptional staff directed by Angel in the Momonohana restaurant made our trip unforgettable. Not only did they do everything to make us feel welcome, they went above and beyond in preparing anything we wished for. One night, Lorenzo, our waiter made us a special flambe dessert. The next night he made a delicious flambe entree of prawns, tequila and a light tomato creme sauce. Delicous. Alejandro made us a lovely dish of sashimi that was unbelievably fresh and delicious. On our last night, Angel, Lorenzo, Alejandro, Pedro, Jorge and others lined up to give us big hugs before we left. Too cute!! Our room was nice. The appointments themselves were beautiful, but the view was peek-a-boo at best due to a rather tall tree outside our patio. We kicked ourselves for not attempting to at least ask for an upgrade, but next time I will definitely see if we could get one for no cost, or at least a minimal cost. Our guest representative that tried to talk us into the time-share meeting didn't take the bait when I asked what the hotel capacity was since it was the low season, and I mentioned that we wish we had a better ocean view. She smiled, but that was it. Oh well. The pool is nice. Swim up bar is fun and the waitstaff, especially Yanet, was quick to deliver whatever we wanted. Be sure to ask for a double shot of whatever liquor is in your drink. I do believe that they may not always use top shelf liquor, but if you ask for what you want, you get it with a smile. The beach was just steps from the pool. The water is green/blue and lovely to be out in, especially when the waves kick up. The shopping on Avenita 5 is great. I don't know exactly how long that road full of shops and restaurants was, but it's a lot of fun to roam in the evening. Just around the corner from Playacar Palace is a great Cuban bar called the Havana Club. Great live music and although we never ate there, the food looked and smelled really good. Have a mojito..........or several. Let's see, what else. Oh, yes, the Cielo bar in the lobby is open and breezy and has one of the friendliest bar tenders I've encountered, Gonzalo. He's quick to make conversation and makes you feel welcome. Gonzalo has made two friends in us and we told him to look us up if he's ever in Seattle. Great guy! Rosa also was notable in that she was very warm and accomodating. She roamed between the Luna Lounge and Cielo bar. As for the tours that are included............I really enjoyed Chichen Itza. I completely agree with our very enthusiastic guide, Raul, that 2 1/2 hours is not nearly enough time to soak it all in. Other than the Playacar Palace staff, the tour we booked for Coba was the absolute highlight of the trip. I heard another reviewer bad-mouthing Chaza and how you shouldn't book through them.. From our experience, we received nothing but excellent service. Our tour to Coba was through All-tour-native tour group. Our guide was Eduardo. The good thing about taking a smaller tour, at our own expense because the included tour conflicted with our schedule, is that you're in a van of at most 8 people as opposed to being among dozens on a big bus. The cost was only 100 bucks!! Our Coba tour started with a trek into a village where we did a zipline, repelling and then kyaked to an area where we hiked to a cenote. Awesome!!!!! A village Shaman blessed us upon entering the cave to ask for our safety and a safe trip home. Swimming in the cenote was incredible. Except for small opening and the lighting that was provided, it would have been almost completely dark. The water is crystal clear and so refreshing after being in the heat above on land. If you go to a cenote, please remember to not put anything on your body like sunscreen, bug spray, etc. so as to not contaminate the water. The cenotes are a main sourse of drinking water for the Mayan people. After that we went back to the village where a delicious spread of food awaited us for lunch. Once we were done, we were headed to Coba. You have the choice of walking, bicycling or taking a \"Mayan limo\" in order to get to the main pyramid. For $3.00 I recommend renting a bike. Luckily the main pyramid, Nohoc Mul is still open and available for climbing unlike the one at Chichen Itza where someone died from a fall last year. Can you believe that person that fell was 80 something years old? I do hope they open Chichen Itza again. To be on top of Nohoc Mul is an amazing feeling. The view is spectacular. Our guide, Eduardo, informed us that there is still so much in uncovered ruins that as you look out over the jungle, you see where the trees and foliage are higher up in spots and that this is where there are probably more ruins they have yet to uncover. So cool. The only downside to my trip was some of the guests I encoutered at either the hotel or on tours. From people whining about a tour requiring a small amount of physical activity, or those that were completely disrespectful to the Shaman when they lit up cigarettes at the mouth of the cenote and talked really loudly as he was doing his blessing. Oh, and the guests that don't tip. Tip, tip, tip and tip again. What's a few bucks compared to the hundreds spent on the trip? My friend and I noticed that SO MANY people did not tip wait staff or tour guides or the people in the Mayan villages that supported the different adventures we went on. Countless times we'd see guests at the pool order drink after drink and leave without tipping. Again we'd see people not tipping after a dinner where they had been doted upon all evening by the very capable and enthusiastic staff. So often we would see guests get up from the table and gush about how wonderful the food was and how great the service was upon saying goodbye, and still wouldn't leave anything on the table or place a tip in the waiter or maitre d's hand. Oh, and there is a dress code, but the staff was probably too kind to want to enforce it. But so many yahoos came to dinner in flip flops, shorts and shirts with beer logos or sports themes on them. Not that you have to put on a suit and tie or a sequined gown, but jeez people, have some decorum. Unbelievable. Anyway, those two items above had to be the peeve of the trip and that's just something in life you can't control. So the moral of my story is that Playacar Palace exceeded my expectations in so many ways. Do the tour of Coba through AllTourNative tours. The only thing I wish I had more time for was snorkeling over at Cozumel and going to the other properties for dinner..............just not enough time!!

A little intro to us, my husband and I are late 60`s, have travelled around the world, visiting several Continents, many countries and States. This was our 13 trip to the Yucatan penninsula but our first time staying in Playa del Carmen. Arrived at 11am in the cancun airport, breezed through Immigration and customs, found our transportation, Chaza travel and were on our way. Took us about an hour by van to Playacar. We were greeted with an ice cold cloth and an equally ice cold glass of champagne........lovely! Checked in and immediately was taken to our room, #327 ocean view in the middle of the resort. The room. A very large room, probably about 25x18 feet. Kingsize bed with exquisite linens, a pillow top mattress, with an additional soft pad, gorgeous linens, a down duvet, quilted spread and lovely embroidered bed scarf and throw pillows. Large down pillows completed the bed. A very large 2 person jaccuzzi, a piece of furniture contained drawers, a mini bar with the usual beer, water, and soda and a liquor cabinet containing rum, scotch, brandy and tequilla. A flat screen TV with satelite programming sat on top of this furniture. 2 lovely end tables topped in marble which illuminated when you turned on the light at night. Another marble topped table with two easy chairs for dining. The bathroom had a vanity area, a separate large walk in shower and toilet. The bars. There are 4 bars, a two level pool bar, one in the pool and one pool side, a very large lobby bar, and the Luna bar where a lot of the evening entertainment takes place. Drinks were all top shelf, excellent choices. You can order Thai appetizers in the Luna bar and these were all delicious especially the Thai spring rolls. There are 10 choices of these appetizers. The Restaurants. There is buffet food for breakfast and lunch with many many choices, most of them made to order, these are served in the Cafe del Mar which turns into an a la carte Mexican restaurant at dinner. The Terrazza, which is Italian, with excellent steaks as well as seafood and pasta dishes for dinner and The Momo No Hana which is Asian serving Chinese and Japanese food. Try the fried ice cream or the Tempura fried bananas for dessert. Pool area and beach. The pool is quite large for a boutique sized hotel (209 rooms) Lots of loungers on 2 or 3 levels for sunning, plenty of umbrellas and palm trees for shade. The beach is coming back and is a good size at this resort. The beach to the south of the resort is eroding again but you can walk past the ferry and visit other large public beaches. Staff. You will have to go far to receive better service and attention than at this resort. The occupancy rate was only at 20% (about 90 guests) but I know in my heart that you would receive the same wonderful service if it had been at capacity. Room service was very good with a good choice for breakfast and lunch/dinner. Entertainment staff tried their best but not many guests were into participating. The resort overall. This is a modernistic, minimalistic designed resort. Everything is white, with splashes of cream, coffee and taupe for color. It is in exceptional condition as it has only been open for 10 months. Everyone from check in to check out were great, proffessional people. To sum up, would I come back here again? definitely. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants a relaxing vacation.

My wife and I went on a honeymoon here for 9 nights in the last week of September. This was the \u2018low season\u2019 so occupancy was low. We booked our honeymoon here (and enjoyed it tremendously) for the following reasons: 1.In addition to the pool, we wanted to be able to swim in the ocean, and this hotel has a beach unlike many other hotels. 2.The hotel is immediately adjacent to the town of Playa del Carmen. 3.The reservation included the Palace Passport, which allows you to tour several regional attractions at no extra cost. 4.The hotel appears to be an excellent resort with ocean view rooms and fantastic service, but was less expensive than similar rooms at high end resorts like Royal Hideaway and Riu Palace Riviera Maya 5.Rooms were said to offer internet access (not completely true), and each room has a safe I have little, subjectively, to add to what others have said already, so I will try to provide some objective info to help you decide whether this hotel would be right for you. The Booking: Booked through CheapCaribbean, their prices were significantly lower than sites like Orbitz, expedia, and allinclusiveoutlets. Their price included airport transfer, and travel insurance. Arrival :Upon arrival at Cancun airport, look for the people in the cheap Caribbean T-shirts, they will ask you for your voucher, which you must also show to the hotel. The transport people asked specifically for a airport transfer voucher, which was not present, but they did not make a big deal about it. The ride to the hotel was about 1 hr, at check in, we were given some cool towels, and a glass of champagne. They put the pink bracelets on our wrists, which you must keep on for the duration of the stay. The bellman took our bags and escorted us to our room. While walking there, you pass by the lobby bar, and catch a glimpse of Caribbean sea. Room: Our room was impeccably clean, the style of the hotel overall is contemporary, and very soothing. The room had a balcony with ocean view from the 5th (top) floor. There is Satellite tv including HBO. There was a liquor dispenser with rum, tequila, scotch whiskey, and 1 more which I don\u2019t recall (we didn\u2019t use it). There was also a free in-room safe which was large enough to fit our laptop which is 13\u201d wide. The room was cleaned at least once per day, sometimes twice per day. Our maid once made us towel art which was very nice, she always left chocolates on our bed. To my wifes annoyance the maid was occasionally a little too intrusive in her rearrangement of the room, taking our things off the dresser including souvenirs and clothing and put them in the drawers, so that we had to do some searching to find things when we came back to the room. Nothing ever went missing, but I was sure to put all valuables in the safe. We did not complain, as this particular maid only did our room on the last 2 nights, we had no issues with the maid who serviced our room on our first 7 nights. In addition all rooms have a 2 person Jacuzzi, and fridge with beer, lite beer, bottled water, diet coke, coke and sprite, these were restocked daily. Room service was available 24hrs per day, compared with the excellent food at the restaurants, the room service dinner menu was not very impressive. When making a call for room service, they give you a time that it would take (typically less than half an hour), they were always on time, very polite, and then would call to make sure you got everything you want. One night we called the Oriental restaurant to see if we could order from their menu, which they let us do. Eating this wonderful meal on our balcony while looking out at the ocean was an indescribable experience! A word about wireless internet access: I could not get it my room, the front desk informed me that it originates in the lobby, so rooms further from the lobby may not have it. No problem, I would just go to the bar in the lobby when I needed it. (Mexico uses the same voltage and three prong outlets). Food: Excellent, if only we had such restaurants in my hometown, I would eat out much more often! The only bad point, as I said was that the room service dinner menu was not on par with the food at the restaurants. The drinks were very good, they will make them as strong or weak as you like, though the default tends to be on the weaker side. But when you can drink as much as you want, you don\u2019t mind, it allowed me to try more types of drinks without getting tipsy. They don\u2019t use the low rent stuff, though, you are not going to get Blue Label either. Service: Again, as others have said, you are really pampered here. Points against? The bar at the pool and in the lobby only had 1 waitress; I would hope that this is not the case when there are more people. Pool: Towards the end of the trip there were more kids, and the pool is not very large, so it fills up quickly. There were always plenty of poolside loungers available, they also have a shallow wading pool at the edge of the pool with loungers in it, to give you the feel of almost being in the ocean without the waves. Beach: The strip of beach in front of the hotel went about 5 to 15 feet before the water, there was plenty of room to put down a towel and sunbathe, but not for beachfront sports. They clean the seaweed off the beach every morning. Hotel Location: This was ideal, walk out of the hotel, and you are in the upscale section of Quinta Avenida (fifth avenue), a night time stroll along the avenue to shop and people watch is a wonderful way to pass the evening. There are dozens of restaurants, bars, and souvenir shops. Of the all inclusives in PDC, this is the most ideally located. The next closest all inclusive resort was at least a 10 to 15 minute walk further. Adjacent to the hotel is also activities such as parasailing and jet ski rental, as well as the pier. I have seen others write that \u201ccruise ships\u201d dock here. This is not true, these are passenger ferries to Cozumel, I did not find them in any way bothersome, actually it was somewhat quaint to see them. Trips: We went on 3 of the excursions included with the palace passport: Isla Mujeres: The van leaves the Palace at about 8 am, takes you to Cancun, where you board a ferry which takes you to the private beach club, where all food and drinks are included, the food was average at best. At the beach club you have 2 and a half hours to kill, unless you take one of the optional trips such as the dolphin encounter. It was disappointing that they don\u2019t really show you the island other than an optional boat tour around it. We paid a taxi driver $20 to drive us around and show us the sights for an hour and a half. We toured the aquarium, walked up the lighthouse, visited downtown, took a walk on Playa Norte. Playa Norte is a beautiful beach on the north side of the island with soft sand and crystal clear water, the private beach is on the south side of the island and does not compare. They then take the ferry downtown for shopping, they try to take you to their preferred shops. The ferry ride back to Cancun was a lot of fun. The guides do a great job, of creating a fun atmosphere, they do this with music, tequila, and lots of silly dancing. Not bad for a free trip! A word about the dolphin encounter; the tour guide told us that there was only 10 min. of time in the water with the dolphins, we ended up booking the dolphin swim at XelHa, this provided about 45 min in the water at about the same price. Coba: The van leaves from the Playacar Palace at 7:30 am, picks up other palace hotel guest along the way. It is about a 2 hr journey. The ruins are interesting, and unlike at Chichen Itza, you can still walk up the largest pyramid. There is about a 1 mile walk each way to the pyramid over flat terrain, there are also \u2018bicycle taxis\u2019 if you don\u2019t want to walk. Overall a great excusion. ChichenItza: They stop at a store that sells Mayan crafts, many of the items can be found at a lower price at the site. Overall the site is very impressive, remember however, that this is an all day trip, you leave the hotel at 7:30 and return at about 6pm, all for 2 hours at the site. On the way back they stop for lunch at the same store, it was not very good, there was some entertainment, also not particularly good. At Chichen Itza you can no longer climb the pyramid. This fact, combined with the long travel time, I would recommend this only for people who really are into history/archeology, otherwise, I would go to Coba and/or Tulum.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Snellville, GA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!!!!!

Sorry for the delay but retirement, a trip to Spain and our first grandchild have kept us busy. This was our first trip to the Playacar Palace. The past two years we had stayed at the Sun Palace in Cancun. When the Sun Palace was destroyed by Hurricane Wilma, I called Palace Resorts in Miami and was given the choice of transferring our reservation to the Playacar Palace, the Moon Palace, the Cozumel Palace or the Puerto Vallarta Palace. We choose the Playacar Palace and were very glad we did. The hotel is a good 45-50 minutes south of the airport in Cancun. For that reason, I would try to avoid an early return flight since you would have to get up very early on your departure day. Try to book an early afternoon flight so you are not rushed and can enjoy a last buffet breakfast. The food is outstanding although we did not enjoy the Asian restaurant as much as the Italian or the buffet. The atole at breakfast is excellent. The wine cellar consists of temperature controlled racks on one wall of the Italian restaurant. It is two stories high and the waiters climb up inside the racks to fetch the wine. Try the Mexican coffee \u2013 outstanding. The service and cleanliness are, as is always the case with a Palace resort, absolutely top notch. Room toiletries are large size and good quality. What with the new carry on restrictions, I see no need for anyone to bring shampoo, soap, conditioner, etc. The d\u00e9cor is minimalist but gives a fresh, clean look. The evening shows are good and varied. I thought they were better than in previous years at the Sun Palace. Fifth Avenue, a block north of the hotel, is great for shopping or just strolling. We liked it much better at night. Two nights we took a cab from the hotel halfway up Fifth Avenue and walked back to the hotel. Bargain with the merchants. It is fun. Try to learn a little Spanish and you will get a better price. Since my wife\u2019s father was born in Spain, she can get by pretty well and has a ton of fun negotiating. We took the ferry to Cozumel and visited the Cozumel Palace for lunch. Food was great but not as much variety as at the Playacar Palace. There is no beach at the Cozumel Palace although I understand they have a shuttle to a beach area. The beach at the Playacar Palace is coming back. On calm days, there is no better water anywhere. The list of employees who deserve mention is extensive: Victor (waiter in Italian restaurant), Maria (fajitas cook), Jose Luis (waiter), Martin (singing waiter), Jorge (waiter), Cesar (waiter), Ingrid (pool area), Jose (the man with the tequila cart at the pool), Daniel (with the perpetual grin) and Sandor (the Oberlin College educated public relations manager). Although this is an all-inclusive resort and there is no reason to tip, I always bring a supply of $1s and $5s. The service you receive will be absolutely outstanding if you don\u2019t tip but we do so as an expression of our thanks for the overwhelmingly friendly, smiling and helpful service we always receive at a Palace Resort. Sandor actually tours the buffet restaurant in the mornings asking if anyone has a complaint. There are very few but if he is presented with something he can fix, it is done immediately. He can\u2019t be held responsible for the weather or his Oberlin inculcated political views. Complaints: 1. The room slippers were on order and had not yet arrived. 2. The couple we were with found the shrimp in the Asian restaurant were not as large as those in the buffet. 3. I would like to see a slightly deeper area within the pool. All very minor but I need to keep Sandor on his toes. The last two years, we have vacationed in Cancun, then Playacar, with friends. This trip my wife totally corrupted her friend Karen who usually doesn\u2019t drink. Now when we go out to dinner here at home, the restaurant had better make mojitos or Karen will demand to know why. If they run out of mint, try a capirina.

Aventura food is not quite as good, but still lovely none the less. We paticularly enjoyed the pools and spa at Aventura, but there is no beach. The lagoon there is fun to snorkel and kayak in. The beach at the Playacar is just lovely, and the hotel is very close, walking distance, from the dock that the ferry comes in to take you to Cozumel. We went to Cozumel for the day and spend some time at the Palace resort in Cozumel until our snorkeling appointment later that afternoon. Cozumel Palace is not as big as the other 2 palace resorts, but very nice none the less. There is a beautiful infinity pool. And there are steps to walk down into the ocean, and snorkeling gear. Although, no beach. This resort is definitely a place for serious snorkelers or scuba divers. Cozumel has some of the best scuba and snorkeling around. We signed up for one fo the $25 trips at the dock when you get off the ferry. I have to say we were a little worried we had been taken for a ride (untrusting new yorkers and all), but it was one of the best snorkeling trips we had ever had! 3 hours of amazing snorkeling for $25!!!! The guide was very informative, and a great snorkeler. He dove down to the bottom with my underwater camera and took pictures of eels and such for me. I can't freedive that deep, but he could go 25 feet down on his own! Anyways, the Playacar Palace is absolutely gorgeous, best rooms I've been in, with two person jacuzzi in each room!

We had a HUGE double jacuzzi that we spent A LOT of time in. The bed was SO comfortable. (we are thinking about getting a new bed at home now) The service was excellent all around the resort. The bartenders and entertainment staff and servers are very friendly and will do anything for you. The one day it rained, I mentioned wanting chips and cheese from the outdoor bar and before I knew it, a bartender (Alejandro) had gotten it for me. They definitely take pride in their work!! The food was excellent and there was MUCH variety. We especially enjoyed the oriental restaurant (teriyaki shrimp, yum) and the italian restaurant (parmesan soup, yum). And, of course, the drinks were great. Try a banana monkey!! We definitely had our share of chips and cheese and bottled water!! A few special staff members to say HI to: Alejandro and Alberto at the Aqua Bar, Victor and Gonzalo at the Lobby Bar and Alejandra and Esthella, entertainment staff!!

We had a very relaxing time. The Palace is a wonderful hotel. The staff is warm and friendly, especially Francisco. I can't rave enough about the service. Everyone was polite and we always felt welcome. No one bothers you to play games or buy things. The three restaurants at the hotel were great. We enjoyed the food served at the restaurants very much. The Japanese restaurant was excellent! We loved it so much we ate there twice out of the four nights. Because the hotel is small, there is no getting up early and waiting in line to make a reservation for dinner. The hotel is very clean and decorated in a modern, cool style. Our room was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. We had no complaints at all regarding our maid service or the amenities in the room. We always had plenty of towels and the room was very nice. We loved our ocean view. Every morning we pulled our drapes open and saw that it was just another day in paradise! Included in the hotel package is room service. Every morning our breakfast arrived to our room within 10 minutes of the time we requested. How great is that! The resort is right on the beach next to the to the town of Playa del Carmen. You could walk down 5th Avenue where the shops are many. Some of the shops are upscale and funky. You can take the ferry (next to the resort) over to Cozumel for snorkling, restaurants and shopping. Also, when you stay at a Palace resort you can visit all the other Palace resorts and use their facilities. Since we only had four nights, my husband and I spent all our time relaxing at the Playacar Palace. The beach at the Playacar Palace was pretty good despite Hurricane Wilma. Every day more of it returns. The beach is clean and the water just beautiful. We spent every day at the beach mesmerized by the clear turquoise water. We sat there again every night after dinner, listening to the waves looking at the stars and the lights of Cozumel. We have been to Playa del Carmen many times and stayed at many resorts, but we really enjoyed the Playcar Palace so much and will return again. Also, the four night stay was a nice getaway and we can't wait to come back again soon.

It was so nice to sit on the balcony and have such a beautiful view of the water and fun to watch the ferries to Cozumel. The food is absolutely wonderful. A much smaller selection than the Moon Palace but what was available was delicious. We ordered room service breakfast every morning and it was always in our room by the time we had requested. A quick call to room service after we were through and our tray was picked up promptly. My husband was accustomed, while staying at the Moon Palace, to the outdoor grilled steaks. We did not find these at the Playacar Palace but we took the ferry to Cozumel and had dinner at the Cozumel Palace where the grilled steaks can be found. We thoroughly enjoyed the smallness of the Playacar Palace. The staff was so friendly and helpful. We became very friendly with the night bartenders at the pool bar (Alfredo and Caesar) and found them to be as entertaining as the shows. We will definitely go back. We always felt perfectly safe both at the resort and in Playa del Carmen on 5th Ave. Take a lot of 1's and 5's as it is very difficult to get change in American if you want to break larger bills.

My wife and I have stayed at Adventura, but we liked Playacar Palace more. We have two girls ages 8 and 14. We really liked the location of Playacar Palace. It was adjacent to downtown Playa Del Carmen and we enjoyed taking strolls through downtown. Be sure to walk along the downtown beach avenue at night--it is very lively with the many shops and restaurants. Just about anything you could need was close by. We took the ferry to Cozumel. The ferry costs $12 per person, with children under 10 being free. Cozumel Palace is about a 15 minute walk from the ferry (just follow the sidewalk going south). CP was fun to visit and the girls enjoyed the snorkeling that was available at the resort even though there were very few fish. We followed some good advice in not to immediately purchase a return ticket on the ferry. We then had plenty of flexibility on going back. I think the ferry runs all the way to 10:00 at night. We went to Coba and Tulum. We had previously been to Chichen-Itza. The Coba ruins have not been restored much, but you can climb the tall pyramid, which was an incredible experience. Chichen-Itza is a longer trip, but the ruins are more impressive and have been restored very nicely. The Tulum ruins were amazing with the ocean as a backdrop. Our favorite pictures when we got back were of Tulum with the ocean and palm trees. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the tours to the ruins. We also visited Xpu-Ha for a few hours, but there were very few people there, although there looked to be a full staff. There was a small zoo there and the girls enjoyed seeing the animals. Also, there are some ruins adjacent to Playacar Palace (they were right outside our room). There were some more ruins just a very short walk to the south of Playacar Palace. The food was excellent. The Italian restaurant was one of the best we have ever experienced. The service could not have been better at the restaurants and at the resort overall. The staff were always quick to provide anything we needed. Our two girls were sick on different days and the staff tried very hard to help us out. They had a \"kid's club\" which our younger girl really enjoyed. They took very good care of the children. There was not much of a beach in front of the resort, but there were also no rocks in the water. The swimming was wonderful and the ocean was always very calm.

On our first full day at the resort, we decided to spend the day at the pool enjoying the sun. My wife, who is 3 \u00bd months pregnant, was frequenting the restroom next to the towel desk throughout the day. Early in the day, she commented to me that she thought someone was coming in the bathroom when she was in there, but there was nobody else in there when she would leave the stall. We decide perhaps the wind was blowing the door open and went on with our day. My wife grew more suspicious of the outside door opening each time she went to the bathroom and decided to go in and wait a moment before doing anything. She heard the main door open and came out of the stall to find Hector the towel boy that had been working all day peaking through the crack in the stall. He played it off as if he wanted to check for soap. Men who need to clean don\u2019t enter a woman\u2019s restroom without knocking where I come from. She immediately came to the pool to get me and I went to the towel desk asking for Hector and the manager. None of the employees, including the manager could speak English or understand what I wanted. In the mean time, Hector had already left the resort, in resort transportation on the way to Cancun. A restaurant manager came over to help translate and finally a representative from \u201cpublic relations\u201d came out to investigate. They quickly tried to blow us off and told us they would speak with Hector in the morning when he arrived for his shift. I asked them to call the police and they said it was not necessary to get them involved. I was really amazed how this was not a big deal to them at all, and explained that in America people go to jail for this. In order to not create a scene by the pool, they took us to the back to fill out a form, which was a blank sheet of paper, detailing what happened. They finally said they were going to fire him upon his arrival the next day and we were just supposed to go back to our room and relax and they are going to take care of it. At this point, we\u2019re outraged and my wife is no longer comfortable with the hotel and staff. I told them we were not going to stay there, and they either needed to send us to another hotel or home with a refund. They arranged for us to stay at Aventura Palace. We packed up and went to the new hotel where most of the staff spoke very good English, but the room location was horrible. It was next to where the maid carts were stored, so at 6 a.m. we were woken up by the maid traffic. After complaining, they moved us to another room, the 3rd day of our trip. We had to meet with our transportation company to rearrange our transport from the new hotel back the airport. They wanted to charge extra money for this change and said we needed to meet with public relations to work it out. We went and met with Cyntia at public relations who told us it was our responsibility to pay the difference, because it was our choice to change hotels. When she says this, my pregnant wife is in tears, and I\u2019m outraged at how we\u2019re being treated. The next day, they said they\u2019ve arranged for transport directly to the airport from the hotel, but we needed to sign a paper for it. She described it as a standard form for transportation, and then when we read through it, it was a release form saying that we would not sue them for anything any of their employees or past employees have done. I\u2019m not going to sue Palace Resorts, but I want to let everyone know how lightly they took the situation and how poorly it was handled.

Bonus - evening events for the kids from 7-9pm so the parents could enjoy dinner alone. The beach is small but very clean. Just a short walk down the beach to 5th Avenue and the Cozumel ferry. If you take the ferry - the outside seating can get quite hot/warm and you can really feel the sway from the water. You can also walk out the front of the resort and just down the drive to 5th Avenue for shopping. Location is ideal! Another bonus was the all-inclusive portion that included the mini bar & mini refrigerator in room and room service. The only negative - the resort says they are just 40 mins from airport - the drive took about an hour actually because of the amount of traffic traveling between Cancun & Playa del Carmen.

WHAT A WONDERFUL PLACE! This was our 4th time to the Cancun/Playa Del Carmen area but the first time we did an all-inclusive. In my opinion, AI is the way to go! Hotel--Not huge which really makes it a better experience. This hotel only has a little over 200 rooms. We upgraded at the time of booking to a two room suite (#243). SO WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! The room was beautiful and very clean. We were on the second floor with an ocean view--a real ocean view. We could step out onto our porch and were practically standing on top of the water. The suite had one wet bar with tequilla, rum, brandy and scotch and two refrigerators filled with water, beer, and softdrinks. The two person jacuzzi was really nice and had an ocean view. In fact, the entire suite had a view of the ocean so when the curtains were open, blue water was all around. The bathroom area was open (and I mean really open--no door on the toliet area) with a two person shower, sink and vanity area and toliet area. We had a great view of the ferry dock as well, and we watched these go to and fro. Also, we could hear the waves slapping against the bulkhead while we slept in our room. That was very very cool. Our first night, we came back to the room and room service had left a bottle of sparkling wine and truffles. Very nice even guesture, but neither of us drink wine. Each night we came back to the room to turn down service. Very nice. Pool--Large enough for me, but I am definately a beach person. The nice thing about the Playacar pool is that it almost seems to be out over the beach. Again, you can see blue water all around you even when in the pool. Swim up bar was okay as well, but I did not spend much time in the pool--too many people drinking and never getting out. The pool area did have a wading pool that was seperate and faced the beach. I put my chair in that or just layed out in this as the water was only about 6 inches deep. Beach--Not a wide expanse of beach, but enough and BEAUTIFUL! My husband and I spent a lot of time in the ocean. Also, you can walk down the beach in both directions and find lots of sand and beach to lay on if you want to. Food--GREAT. I have no complaints and neither did my husband. The buffet is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The omlets made to order are really good. The japanese rest. was fantastic and the Italian was good as well. Again, neither Steve nor I are big Italian food people so we only ate there once. However, it was good. We ate at the Japanese place two nights. We ordered room service twice at night. This menu is limited and the food okay but not as great as the rest. However, they do bring your food quickly when you order in, and that was very nice. I did order coffee and pan dulce for 7 a.m. daily. It arrived by 6:45 a.m. each day. I very much enjoyed sitting on the balcony and drinking coffee while looking at the water. I never slept past 6:30 a.m. Gym--Okay. Small but it had everything--free weights, the machine weights, stationary bikes, treadmills and eliptical trainers. I did not do the classes as I used the treadmill and weights. I took the shuttle back and forth, because my husband worried about me walking alone. However, in my opionion, I was totally safe walking but was unwilling to have this debate while on vacation! Playacar/Playa Del Carmen--Great little town. We had been here once before, and truly this is the place I always want to stay. It's not too large, not completely commercialized, yet, but I think it's coming dang it. And the beach is the most beautiful if you want to see waves and blue, blue water. The shopping is ok, but being a South Texas girl, I found the market prices very, very high especially when compairing to Matamoros or other border towns! People--The people at the Palace and Mexico in general are wonderful. The staff at the Playacar Palace worked very hard to please the guests, and my husband and I were astounded at how many people did not tip! I know it says gratituity included in the package, but we tipped everytime we ate, had room service delivered, caught a ride, had drinks, etc...I think it amounted to about $200 for the whole time we were there. One night, we were eating in the buffet, and my husband tipped the young man when he brought my husband a beer. The young man ran off and then came back with this huge platter of grilled shrimp (we later found out he went next door to the Itallian to get these). My husband did not ask for this but we think our waiter wanted to do something nice for us! Those shrimp were delicious! Anyway, what I mean is just a little bit from us meant a lot to them. We found out they make about $12 a day so tips can really really make a difference! Thanks to Hoffer's advice, we took $100 in ones and $100 in fives and used these bills for our tipping! Trips--We did the Tulum one, and it was really cool to see but be advised, Tulum is very hot. I am from the Corpus Christi area, and I am saying it was very very hot and unbelievably humid (Corpus' humidity runs about 95% year round.) There was NO wind. We were soaked from sweating. Good thing they take you in the morning and return you about 2 p.m. Also the shopping trip back in my opinion (and again consider the source) was a tourist trap. Prices were unbelievable. Again, I am compairing to the border town prices--I can't help it. We cancelled our snorkeling trip as we did one on our own and got over 2 and a half hours on three different locations on the reef. The palace trip was only 40 minutes of snorkling. All in all we had a wonderful trip, and both of us will go back. Next time, though, we are taking our kids!

We booked through FunJet and when we landed, the shuttle was there to take us to the hotel. we had about a 10 minute wait for other passengers, but we were able to sit in the airconditioned van and drink a beer. it was about a 45 minute ride, and like other reviews that i have read, when you drive up, the hotel is nothing spectacular, but it really is. Check-in was simple, the only complaint that I had was that when i asked to be upgraded to a honeymoon suite, we were told that the hotel was full when actually it was only at 50% full. the first room that we were given had a partial ocean view and we faced the neighboring hotel. the room was nice, but the next day, i asked if there was another room with a better view and there was and we were promptly moved the next PM. Each room does have a jacuzzi tub and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. the food was delicious. We tried every restaurant, Mexican Buffett, Italian and the Oriental. I was not pleased with the Oriental, but then again i am not that much of fan of it either, but my husband liked it. The Italian was good, we had a bottle of wine and if you are a big chocolate fan, get the Gondala dessert! seems like all we did was eat and drink around the clock, we never went hungry and no stomach issues whatsoever. the waiters were incredible, Jose Luis and Rafael were our favorites at the mexican buffett. we always asked to sit in their section. they never ask for tips, but we tipped them about $5/meal and bartenders/waitresses about the $3-4. the pool area was nice, perfect size for the hotel. we never had an issue with finding a chair, but like another post, the cement is slick, so be careful. It was nice to have a waitress come and ask for your drink order, Rosa was great and always remembered my name. we did go to Cozumel for the day and visitied the Cozumel Palace. we snorkled and had lunch there, their food was just as good. the facility is beautiful and its only a 40 minute ferry ride + a 10 minute walk. one thing about the rooms that were nice was the in-room safe that you program your own code. i have been to other AI's where you are given a key and if you lose the key there is a $75+ charge or also other places where the boxes are downstairs. this one is great. we wanted to go to the Moon Palace or the Aventura Spa Palace, but never made it to either one. However, i did talk to a few people that were staying at the AP and they stated that our food was much better and that the AP catered more towards health food. if thats correct, i dont know, but that is what they told me. another pro about the hotel is the location. Like other posts, you are really located in the middle of everything. you are a 2-3 minute walk to shopping, Senor Frogs, Carlos and Charlies, but far enough away that you do not hear any of the noise. also, the ferry is right there, yet, its not noisy. we did venture into town several times and there is a Wal-mart about 10-15 walk and other grocery stores in case you need something.

We booked one of the honeymoon suites (room 141) and were simply speechless when we stepped into the room. It has a full living room and a king bed and of course a two-person jacuzzi (which every room at the resort has). Stepping out of the patio doors put the icing on the cake. We had a small table with two chairs in the shade and a deck that was enormous with two lounge chairs as well. We could have jumped from our chairs into the Caribbean. It was beautiful! We also received a bottle of champagne and truffles our first night because we were honeymooners. This is a nice little touch. Honeymooners also get a special dinner for two with a bottle of champagne on a night of their choosing during their stay. It was awesome. There are three restaurants to choose from......Oriental, Italian, and International. The martini bar also serves Thai food. The room service menu is not big, but you must try the Palace Club Sandwich. We ordered one every night we were there. Overall, the food was good. Several of the reviews I read complained a lot about the beach (or lack thereof), but my husband and I both agreed that you don't need a large sandbar to enjoy the water. There are no lounge chairs on the beach, but if you just want to lay out, there are plenty of chairs around the pool and also in the reflection pool, and you can still see the ocean from these chairs. We spent a ton of time in the ocean and enjoyed every minute of it. The resort is located pretty much downtown, but it doesn't feel like it at all. It only takes about three minutes to get to 5th avenue, which is the main shopping strip. You can also walk to the Cozumel ferry from the resort in about three minutes. There are bars everywhere at the resort as well. There is one in the lobby, the martini bar, the pool bar, and you can also order any drink you want at any of the restaurants. That's not to mention the two liquor dispensers we had in our suite. There was no lack of available alcohol! The tours included with the resort are pretty nice, and if you have time you take advantage of them. Otherwise, they would be very expensive. Most inlcude transportation and lunch so it's pretty nice. We were pretty disappointed in the snorkeling trip though. We only got to snorkel about thirty minutes and saw very little life in the water. We had to spend the whole day at the beach club though, and they tried to make you pay for all sorts of activities like horseback riding, waverunners, atvs, etc. Everything was pretty expensive, and it seemed sort of like they were hassling you. But other than that, the tours were good. The Tulum tour was nice and had the most beautiful beach we had ever seen. A must see! Overall, I can't find much to complain about at Playacar Palace. We have already made a plan to go back in the future.

We had an amazing time in spite of the weather (the sun didn't come out for the first 4 days). Check in: Was a breeze. Our room wasn't quite ready when we got there, so we went down to the buffet and ate lunch...back in an hour and we were ready to go. Room: Very nice, clean, plenty of towels, nice jacuzzi, nice view, very spacious, etc. etc. Made use of the mini bar everyday. Nice to have bottled water whenever you need it. Shower was very big, great water pressure. Enjoyed the palace robes. Pool area: Ample size for the amount of people there during our stay. Never had trouble getting a choice spot, even when we didn't go out to the pool until 10am. Service at the pool was great, enjoyed drinks from the pool bar. There still isn't much of a beach, but you can enjoy the view from the pool without getting sand all over you...almost enjoyed that more than actually sitting on the beach. Food: Enjoyed all the resturants. Breakfast is great...omlets were wonderful. Always lots of choices at the lunch buffet, but I was usually still so stuffed from breakfast I just got fresh fruits and nachos with pico de gallo. Spring rolls in the Chinese resturant were to die for, and the steak was good at the Itallian resturant. But I have to say I enjoyed the buffet at dinner best. Can order surf and turf, lots of great options for sides, and could get my second nacho fix! Drinks: I am not much of a liquer drinker but the folks in our crowd enjoyed them. I stuck to Dos Equis....very good. Location: The location is the best part....so convenient to the ferry to Cozumel and the downtown area. 5th Avenue is a must see. So many great shops, resturants, etc. Must Do's: Check out other palace resorts. One day we took the ferry over to Cozumel and walked down to the Cozumel Palace (a little bit of a hike...10 min walk or so, but you can take a cab). They have a nice pool area, very similar in size to Playacar, but they have no beach. Instead they have snorkeling right off the dock. You can get your snorkel gear there and it is free. Not the best snorkeling but I did see some pretty fish. Also, we took a cab to Aventura Spa Palace ($14 one way per cab, 15 min ride). We were very impressed...very massive resort...very pretty. The pool is great and they have a station where you can make your own nachos (can you tell I am addicted to Nachos!). We spent the day at the pool then went over to the Spa for showers (very nice!) and ate at the steakhouse. Steak was pretty good, nothing to write home about but the ambiance (sitting out on a deck at night in the caribbean breeze sipping wine) couldn't be beat. I wasn't impressed with the lagoon, smelled like the bulkhead here at our soundfront place (very stinky) and just didn't feel clean. The pool was great though and the place is a must see. Negatives: I didn't like that the gym was a walk or shuttle ride away. I know most people don't care but personally I work out like a fiend for months before I go on vacation so I look decent in a swim suit and I like to work out at least 2 or 3 times while I am on vacation so I don't completely undo all that work while pigging out at the buffets (on Nachos!). But my husband didn't like the idea of me going by myself (athough personally I think it is very safe, but he is a worry wart), and I didn't like dragging him against his will, so it was frustrating to me. And there wasn't much to the gym (the one at Aventura was much more impressive). Secondly, I didn't like the decor. I guess when I go to Mexico I enjoy the beautiful colors you see most places...and Playacar Palace is white, white, white. Nit picky I know but I think they should add some color to the place. That is just me though. Positives: Clean, beautiful view, great service, location, location, location, and great Nachos!!! Also, I thought it was really neat that you can borrow a laptop from the front desk and surf the internet in the lobby for $5/30min. Lastly, I have to say that if we plan on returning to mexico next year, I would pick playa del carmen over cancun, but I don't know that I would stay at Playacar Palace again. It was a great place, but I have to say that when we visited Aventura I felt a little envious. I think next year I would rather try staying at Aventura...but visiting Playacar for the beach, view, shopping, etc. It is a great resort, but I don't know if it is one I would always come back to when there are so many others to try out!", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staten Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service awaits you at the Palace\u201d", "Author": "jowenm", "ReviewID": "UR5288088", "Content": "My husband (35) and I (40) stayed at the Playacar Palace from April 27th thru May 3rd 2006. We stayed at Moon Palace last April, and found it too big and bit too impersonal. Although we LOVED the pool at Moon, and the thought of a hammock on every patio would be ideal (even thouh we did not get one!). The choices of restaurants were amazing at Moon there are only 3 at Playacar. We decided to go further south, since we were concerned with the mixed reviews of Cancun\u2019s ability to bounce back fully from Wilma. Where applicable I will throw in a comparison to Moon Palace in case you are torn between the two. The ride to Playacar Palace from Cancun airport is barely 40 minutes. (The Moon Palace is only 7 minutes from the airport) and that included dropping off 2 other couples first. The Beach is tiny.. But it is there (you walk right across it to get to Senor Frogs and the Cozumel Ferry) and the ocean is VERY swimmable (compared to Moon Palace \u2013 too sea \u2013grassy and not blue). I spent more time then I thought in the ocean! The pool is small, but not crowded and we never got a chair in the shade,- noone was in the chairs in the shade just some personal item. This is my biggest pet peeve when vacationing.. These people were walking around town and holding shady chairs pool-side! (this was not a problem at the MP) . The palm trees seemed wind-shorn, and hence are not giving much shade, once they grow in, it should be better. Only umbrellas are available for shade, and they are limited and grabbed up early! Do not miss the sun deck up the steps, by the pool, go grab some couches/pillows, umbrella, some drinks, lay there and RELAX staring at the ocean! We spent hours there, it is quieter than the pool, and the couches are SO relaxing and comfortable. Front Desk As described many times before- this is a very stark white hotel, although it does grow on you. I saw a review here about the \u2018attitude\u2019 regarding lost pool cards/ and or bracelets. I must have met with the same gentlemen and I did find it a bit unnecessary. He should point out to people to be mindful of the \u2018vacuum\u2019 effect of the open hallway doors and the open sliders to the patios, the slams are never ending and what is killing the plaster. When we called for a bell hop to check out, he never showed up and I didn\u2019t want to miss our van back to Cancun, so we lugged our own luggage. She said 15 minutes, and when they didn\u2019t show up in 25 we left on our own. It seems a convention of some kind was checking out and she should have told us that, and I would have panicked a bit less and just left at that point with my luggage. The hotel is not that big, so this was not a big issue obviously. THE ROOM Thanks to my amazing travel agent Roy Loomis at Liberty Travel (Jersey City) for suggesting we upgrade to the honeymoon suite (Room 143)( for very little cost). I always tease my husband when he drags his butt on vacation that \u201cwe didn\u2019t pay all this money for a hotel room to sit around in it all day\u201d, I have to say this is the first vacation I didn\u2019t want to say it. If we didn\u2019t leave for the beach/pool and/or meals, we didn\u2019t have to leave this room. The DECK outside the sliders is AMAZING!! Part of it is partially covered (in the shade of the above rooms deck) with 2 lounge chairs in the shade and the other half is in the sun right off the ocean with 2 more lounge chairs. There is also a table with 2 chairs. We had breakfast delivered to the room and sat out there and ate.It was lovely. The complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates was also enjoyed on this ABSOLUTELY AMAZING DECK!! Upon getting to our room, the bell hop agreed with us that our shower looked like it was missing a door \u2013 but the front desk explained it was \u2018minimalist\u2019 design and it really should be like that. The toilet is in its own little alcove with a frosted glass door (and a phone. I never understand a need for a phone on the toilet).. Our door was showing wear and tear where the screws were in the wall, I pointed it out in my parting note (when I left a tip for the cleaning women). This door is the only door in the bathroom, which is kind of weird, at first. The shower and sink area are open to the bedroom (behind the bedroom closet- which luckily blocks the view from the outside/ocean, into the room) The living room had a couch and a chair as well as 2 \u2018desk\u2019 like chairs.. For a honeymoon suite, it sure had a lot of chairs. We had robes, but no slippers. One of our liquor dispensers (yes this room was so big.. it had 2) was NOT LOCKED \u2013 so If I wanted to bring the unopened bottles with me as souvenirs I definitely could have done that. The toiletries are HIGH END, my salon in NY sells the Farouk brand, and it is not cheap. THE RESTAURANTS There are only 3 restaurants. If you eat everything at the buffet, it will get repetitive. We treated the buffet layout as a menu, picking selective things to eat. That cut down on the repetiveness of it. The Italian has excellent food and we are both Italian from NY, so we know good Italian food (we hope our mothers don\u2019t read this review). The waiter Oliver is OUTSTANDING and we actually planned nights here according to his schedule. He brought the wrong dessert once, but the Napoleon was just as good as the cheese cake, so no harm no foul! His attention to detail and suggestions from the menu was outstanding. The Asian was excellent also. I even witnessed a family where the mother was allergic to MSG and since all the food contains MSG (although I am usually sensitive to it and had no ill effects), they brought her a menu from the Italian restaurant so she could order and eat with her family. I think they heard allergy and didn\u2019t understand MSG, so they would rather be safe than sorry. Definetely have the banana appetizer Yummy The BARS.. Banana daiquiris are unpredictable; Try Drinks of the Day may find something new you like. Pina Coladas are excellent regardless of what bar you go to. Gonzalo from the pool bar really took a liking to me and was constantly making me more and more exotic beverages to try. Go the Drinks demonstrations, you will get to \u2018taste\u2019 numerous drinks and again may find one you like. (Dos Amigos is VERY good) ENTERTAINMENT A couple of shows were weak, international show was held in indoor bar with the dancers dancing on one of the stages made of tables. The Mexican Idol INTERESTING.. All these people trying to sing ( if you can call it that!) in Spanish (they had American karaoke also) we missed the fire show; we were walking down 5th Avenue. The Mexican show was okay, at least it was held outside. The Circus was very good, it was held in a large conference room in the back of the hotel. Starting time \u2013 don\u2019t worry they never start on time. 8:00 is more like 8:30 in Mexico. The Gym It is actually a 15 minute walk away, we usually took the shuttle there, and walked back, we did tip the driver $1. And by the second day when he saw us walking back, he would pull over on the side of the road and stop to see if we needed a lift. We didn\u2019t use the Golf or Spa facilities. All the equipment faces a window overlooking the golf course, beautiful. Nice and clean, towels and cold water available. Music played is varied and sometimes skippy (I can\u2019t work out to Celine Dion) The Tours We took the Day Tour to Chichen Itza. The tour guides were wonderful We tipped them both $10, and I made the daughter of one them tour guides ecstatic since I tipped her $1.00 , (she would pick up other peoples\u2019 trash while walking around the ruins) Mayan dinner- got me sick, but only for a short time. Please ladies keep in mind that riding on a bus for 3 hours no one wants to be breathing in your perfume / body spray whatever.. Let\u2019s keep the heavy scents to a minimum for those who are partial to be being car sick. I will blame it on the food, but I think it was the woman with too much perfume. Too many people trying to sell you stuff, as you walk around, that was a bit annoying. Keep in mind that the Lights and Sound tour of Chichen Itza is suppose to be amazing, but it is only on Wednesday so plan accordingly. Wednesday was the only day we were not there! The Cozumel Ferry Do not buy a round trip, in Playacar, since you are, then limited to that particular ferry company when coming back, which may mean a 2 hour wait if the other company is coming in. Although tempted to sit on the sides near a window, (most of the ship is indoors- not a lot of outside seating) the a/c units are over your head (blowing into the middle) and you will not get ANY a/c. Sit in the middle section (its 4 seats on each side and then 10 in the middle.. ) The AC works fine here. Cozumel Go on a day when no cruise ships are in town, you will be able to bargain so much more since business is so slow. We took a taxi to Cozumel Palace which had opened on April 3 (a few weeks prior) and there is NO BEACH, there are stairs down to docks where you can snorkel/swim off of. There is a man-made sanded area, which some beach chairs if you really want the sand, but it is by no means a beach. If you think, Playacar Palace has no beach.. You should see the Cozumel Palace.. 5th Avenue I was a slight bit frustrated that I was staying at an All Inclusive, We were eager to try the \u2018local\u2019 color, but the added expense just could not be justified. (We felt better tipping the help, as opposed to eating a meal off property.) But take the walk, and have fun with the hawkers.. Don\u2019t let them bother you! No matter where you say, you are from each day.. That is where they say they are from, it\u2019s actually fun to toy with them. Overall By the time, we checked out, numerous staff members knew and greeted us regularly by our name. We were made to feel like family, and although I had read this on this and similar sights, I didn\u2019t think it should be such a big deal on vacation, but these people are truly wonderful kind hearted souls and they deal with hundreds of people on a regular basis, yet they make the effort to remember our names, it is a great feeling. Other than there only being 3 restaurants, limited shade by the pool, and average service at the front desk at both check in and check out, I can think of nothing else negative to say!", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cI want to live in the Palace!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5235145", "Content": "I returned yesterday from a six day stay at the Playacar Palace and could not wait to write a glowing review (and, truthfully, don't really want to get to work on the piles in my in-box). I booked the Playacar Palace with six of my girlfriends for a \"Chick Trip\" to celebrate the milestone birthdays of several of us. I had stayed here several years ago, before the Palace Resorts renovated it. I had also stayed at other \"all inclusives\" in Cancun and Cozumel. For others, it was their first trip to the Mayan Riviera. We were NOT disappointed. In fact, we left the property only briefly to do some souvenir shopping. Otherwise, our every whim was catered to by the wonderful Palace staff. Rooms were spacious, beds were comfy (they've added pillow tops to 'em), no bugs whatsoever. The food was far and above any other AI I've visted. We particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet every day... omelets, waffles, and pancakes made to order, fresh papaya and kiwi... and mimosas!! Also, you can get \"to go\" boxes from the lunch buffet, load them up and return to your lounge chair by the pool. We did this every day, because we did't want to change into dry clothes for lunch. For dinner, you could have chefs grill steaks or fish filets to order, roast pork, BBQ chicken, traditional Mexican items, and a dessert table as long as a van! Weather did not cooperate for the first few days, but who cared?! We enjoyed the pool bar anyway. A rainy day in PDC is better than a sunny day at work. Bar staff and waiters were genuinely friendly and helpful... Jose Luis brought that darn tequila cart (yes, it's like a dessert cart, but stocked with tequila) to our table every night.... and (Ricky) Martin kept the mimosas flowing at breakfast time. The event staff - Leo, Lalo, and Carla - made pool time fun with water aerobics, black jack, and trivia. And Wed night Karaoke was HILARIOUS in its extra cheesiness!!! Pool waitresses Yanet and Yadira MADE OUR TRIP!! whether it was a frozen margarita refill or a bottled water, they were quick to serve. Tipping may not be required, but that $1, $5, or $10 tip means a lot to them. They work 10-12 hours shifts every day in the hot sun while we're lounging in the pool, and keeping my drink full for an 8 hour stint at the pool was no small task... Yadira earned that big tip! Only caveats - pool deck area is VERY slippery when wet. We saw more than one guest with injured limbs.... so walk carefully. Asian restaurant food was just so-so, but that may be a personal choice. However, the waiters there were super attentive. When they found out is was my birthday, I was presented with a personalized mini-cake (that cheescake was DELICIOSO), extra tequila, a birthday hat, and a rousing Mexican version of \"Happy Birthday\". If those guys don't love their jobs, they are great actors. All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better birthday trip. My girlfriends are already plotting return trips with their husbands and families. We'll be back for sure!!", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Liberty, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cLoved Playacar Palace\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5233309", "Content": "We just returned from the Playacar Palace and had a great time while we were there.

When we came out of the airport Chaza travel were waiting for us. As there were 8 of us they put us on a shuttle bus on our own. The entrance to the hotel was not impressive but the receptoin is lovely with the tree growing in the centre. We were greeted with champagne and wet flannels. We had a few minor problems regarding our check in. For instance they did not have us on the system as having the Palace passport and the 2nd week they had us as a party of 7 not 8. This caused problems when booking trips. The rooms are beautiful. The mini bar was kept well stocked. It was absolutely spotless. Our bedding was changed everyday and all the glass around the hotel was sparkling. The toiletries supplied were good quality and plentiful. Even a shoe cleaning kit. The pool was very nice. We never had a problem getting a bed and remember there were 8 of us. It could get noisy near the pool bar so if you want a quiet day move away from the bar. We never needed to go to the bar as the waitresses were constantly up and down and very quick. The small beach is lovely and the sea is beautiful although the snorkelling off the beach was disappointing. The waitresses even came onto the beach to bring us drinks. Our favourite restaurant was the Buffet. There was plenty of choice. We had lobster one night and after having one were asked if we would like another. The oriental food was good too. Our least favourite was the Italian. It is beautiful and the staff were great but I was not keen on all the food. This is just a personal preference and I am sure some people will disagree. The entertainment team were great even the ones that accompany you on the trips. Be aware that when you go on some of the trips there are extra things you can so such as ATV and Waverunners.

We were very nervous as the resort hadn't opened yet and there were no pics or reviews available. The Playacar Palace greatly surpassed our expectations! Here are the details: Arrival: We met the Chaza travel attendants at the airport- They are outside the airport to your left and wear dark blue pants and khaki colored shirts with the Chaza emblem. When we arrived we were greeted and led to the Check In desk where we were handed champagne and cold wet towels. Our room wasnt ready yet so we went to the buffet for lunch. They filled our champagne glasses here too and welcomed us to the resort. Oh yeah, we are in Mexico now! :) Appearance: The place was spotless! The entrance was not much to look at when you pull up, but the ocean side of the resort is great! I have heard some complaints about the open air lobby, but we loved it. It was so tropical with the curtains blowing in the breeze, and it never got too hot with the wind coming off of the beach. The Room: Perfect! Just look at the pics! Again, everything spotless. They changed the sheets, towels, and mopped the floor everyday. The view could not be more perfect; just beautiful blue water, and all of the rooms have an ocean view. If you are on your honeymoon ask for room #441. It appeared to be the only room where no one could see your balcony unless they were on the water! The bathroom was great too! PRECAUTION: The floor gets VERY slippery as the shower is open to the whole bathroom. This would be our only complaint as we both almost fell too many times to count. The Food: Very Good! Typically food at all inclusives isnt very good, but this was wonderful! We really enjoyed the room service. Especially chocolate cake delivered to our room at night! The portions were suprisingly good. No they were not the typical American \"Biggie Size\", and if that is what you are looking for then I suggest you visit the McDonalds, a short walk from the resort. We never had a drink that tasted watered down except on the excursions where drinks were included. If fact the bartenders were so funny trying to motivate me to take shots of Tequila with my new hubby. No thanks! The Service: Awesome! Our glasses never got empty. We never came back to a dirty room. Every employee we saw in the halls would greet us. We even had the unfortunate experience of having to use the on call doctor for my husband because of all the new foods that he was not used to eating. It was not the water. The doctor was in our room in 15 min. and saved our vacation. I could go on and on about the service so I'll just sum it up with an A+. Oh, and yes we did tip. They deserved it for all their hard work, but never once did we feel like tips were expected. Location: Again great! Close to shopping, clubbing, and ferry to Cozumel. Always something to do! Extras: Definately take the trip to Isla Mujeres. We had the best time! Not really impressed with the Paradise snorkel trip, but definately see Maroma while you are there. We did the speed boats and ATV at Maroma. Very expensive and rushed. If you have any experience on an ATV, you will be bored with this activity! Beach/Pool: Yes, the beach is coming back slowly and you can lay out on it. There weren't very many people out there. The water is breathtaking and the sand is soft with small amounts of seaweed that had been washed up at night. The pool was alright, but somewhat small and crowded around the early afternoon. We did visit Aventura and Cozumel Palaces while we were there and confirmed that Playacar was the right resort for us. Aventura was definately a younger crowd about our age (20's), and there were a lot of activities. There is no beach, but the pool is great. Cozumel was nice, but again no beach and right on the roadside. Be careful when purchasing silver on the island, we saw a lot of fake stuff. Real will be stamped with 925 Mex. Our experiece with the Playacar Palace was far beyond our expectations, and I looked for things to report back to tripadvisor. We would definately stay there again, and I am pushing my husband to take me back for our first anniversary.
