Most rooms are good sized; this one was a bit small but I wasn't there all that much. I have had complimentary suites before. I find the rooms well appointed, very clean and well taken care of each day. Valet parking is pricy, and while you can go around the corner for half the price, it was full the day I arrived, and the clientele standing around created an unsafe environment in my view.

The hotel was very clean and had a great sense of style - felt like we were in Monaco (the country) at times! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff were all extremely helpful and patient as we tried to navigate a new-to-us city. If there was anything I could complain about it would be that the light flickered for a second in the bathroom when you turned it on... that's really it! It was an amazing hotel 2 blocks from Union Square! Be weary though that a few blocks S/W of the hotel, the streets get a little scary - a lot of begging and drug use - even some prostitution. But that's common in all tourist areas. There was never a moment I didn't feel safe at the Monaco - I would just suggest not going too many blocks S/W. Besides all the good shopping and tourist attractions (like Pier 39) are to the N/E :) The walk to Pier 39 took us about 20-30 minutes depending on how much we wanted to stop in shops and such along the way. It's nice to walk through China Town and the Italian area - great food! I absolutely suggest this hotel!

I have a parking tip. The hotel charges $50 a day. We found a garage at the first left hand turn after the hotel which is Shannon, I believe. There is a garage on that first block that charged us $25 for one day parking including taking it out if we wanted which we didn't need to do. It was close enough that we had no problem taking our luggage from the garage to the hotel. One more tip-if you stay at a Kimpton, join their reward program immediately.

Very cosy, well thought-out and retreat-like with canopy beds all pillowed up.

Downside is the room service that we need to pay a extra charge of $5 for delivering room service (a pizza of $6/- plus 21% tax, $5/- , then personal tips all come to over $43 for a $6 pizza is a bit steep.

I thought we would hear a lot of street noise, but with the exception of a few sirens on St Patrick's Day night (tons of parties in the town), it was quiet. The suite was smaller than the one in the Hotel Monaco in Portland, but was certainly enough room. The bed was comfortable, the dark out curtains allowed for a nice, dark room at night. I liked the pillows provided. Perhaps at one point I put the type of pillow we liked down in a profile, as they were perfect. Good heat/cooling system. The room could be made a perfect temperature. The windows actually open, so if you want fresh air ..it's there. The bathroom vanity was bit small. Limited counter space. Aveda bath products and plenty of complimentary items if you need anything. Just call the front desk. Perhaps we were in a ADA room, but the shower head was on a wand that could be moved up and down in the pipe (can't remember the name of that). Not a problem for me, but my husband is very tall, so he needed to hold the shower wand and could just stand under it. There were rails in the tub, and it was a low tub. Not a worry to us. Plenty of towels and pretty good thick, although I have had better in other hotels. WiFi was excellent. Free if you join the In Touch program. Many hotels in the area charge about $15/day for wifi. We used the fitness room, steam and hot tub. Fitness room was good, but small. Equipment good...two ellipticals, two treadmills, two recumbant bikes and one stair climber. Small collection of free weights, ball, bosu ball and some cords. Lobby always had fresh water, with either cucumbers or oranges. Every night was a wine reception. I thought it might have local wine, but was disappointed to see Little Penguin being served (Australia). Coffee, tea and hot chocolate available in the lobbby in the morning. If you want Starbucks, it's a block down the street. yes, Hotel Monaco is on the edge of the Tenderloin, so don't go left when you leave the building if you don't want to see reality. We took BART from the airport, bused , cable car'd, walked and took one cab while in San Francisco. You do not need a car if you plan to stay in the city, so the parking cost should not be a concern.

The hotel is very centrally located, near Union Square, lots of restaurants and theaters. It has a special flair, very European and we enjoyed that it also has a restaurant on site. The staff is kind and attentive. The reason I did not give it \"Excellent\" is that there were a few let downs. I had contacted the hotel before the visit three times to stress the importance of a quiet room. I know the hotel is located down town and in a big city, but I had heard that it has rooms back to the courtyard which are very quiet. I am also a Kimpton Intouch member where I also stated that I require a quiet room. My husband is in the Military and it is very important to us as surprising noises, like sirens can stress him. We were given a room on the 7th floor, which is their highest floor, but to the street side. We came well equipped with a white noise maker, and putting the in room fan on, but there was still a lot of outside noise. My husband was ok with it that's why I left it alone. The second night they put a family with a dog in the next room and he barked a few times, but overall it was ok. I just think that if somebody calls and mentions that they need a quiet room and also stresses the reason for military, the hotel should have tried their best to accommodate us. The room was also very small. We had a desk on one side of the bed, but the other side had not even a nightstand. As you are most of the time out and about we did not mind the size, but if I would stay longer then a weekend I think it would be a problem. As a Kimpton Intouch member you get free WiFi, a free Newspaper to your door, $10 discount on the mini bar and $30 of the Spa. We also had breakfast included, which was a Continental breakfast at the restaurant, containing of coffee, juice , fruit and a pastries. On check in we had to remind them that we had the booking including breakfast to get the coupon as well as that one gets a Newspaper as a member. If you come with your car park on Jones street.

Each afternoon at 5pm the hotel provided a lovely cocktail hour in the lounge off the lobby, complete with masseuse, Wii for the kids, and a selection of wines and non-alcoholic spirits.

Westwood set the property standard for me. I stayed at Monaco years ago, and recent negative reviews made me concerned this property had deteriorated. Not so. From arrival to departure, my yorkie and I experienced excellent service (starting with a yummy c-o-o-k-i-e). We stayed here for two weeks due to construction at home. After a sleepless night in a queen room, due to a noisy guest on the other side of a connecting door, I was upgraded to a king suite. The wireless internet worked perfectly. I am an In-Touch member, so no charge for internet (hotels that charge make a mistake). Our top-floor windows faced the street, and there was noise from police/fire sirens during the night, but it was less disturbing than the noisy guest in our prior connecting room! The bed was a bit firm, probably because I don't weigh much so prefer softer mattresses. I like the white duvet covers (and no potentially nasty \"bedspreads\"). The bathroom lighting needs to be improved. It is dim, because of the politically correct dim fluorescent bulbs. One small imperfection-I never did get my newspaper delivery; but if one gets downstairs early enough, the hotel has stacks of three popular papers available. I was comfortable with the bright, eclectic decor. The room was in very good shape, the shower was good. The rooms/suites are smaller than Palomar Westwood (different market). High quality (\"George\") doggy bowls and bed were delivered, and my lil guy was treated like a prince. I forgot to bring his food the first day, and the lovely petite young lady at the front desk, Francis, saved the day by giving him a cache of cookies. The wine-hour opportunity to socialize with other guests around the fireplace is a really nice feature, and it was my dog's favorite time (so many opportunities to show off). Several evenings, samples of the restaurant's flatbreads were served. Every member of the staff offered excellent service. In addition to Francis, Jonathan stands out, but that is not to say that anyone under-performed (I simply don't remember the names). Housekeeping was excellent. The carpeting in the living room looks somewhat worn (probably stained by wine spills), but that room is an inviting place to relax. The very good morning coffee got me out to walk the dog. I checked out the fitness area but hadn't brought attire; it was adequate for any workout. The restaurant used to be a favorite. It is not as good as it used to be, and I don't find the menu as appealing. It is not as good as the Palomar Westwood, which is very good. The location is surrounded by aggressive bums. Too bad.

Guests would gather on an other room with comfortable seating and have their choice of white or red wine. They were willing to help us in anything we needed, offering to book shows for us, giving us the detailed maps of Chinatown with restaurant suggestions, and so on. The location is great, right in the theater district, about three blocks away from the Central Station (where you can catch the double decker tour buses that take you by every major attraction in the city) and couple more to Chinatown. It is near several cool art galleries for art lovers delight, selling original Mir\u00f3, Chagall and Picasso lithographs, even some selling Doctor Seuss' works. It also has a lot of bars and pubs nearby that seem to attract a lot of theater goers before/after plays, besides people that come into the neighborhood for that purpose.

The bottom line - it's not comfortable - and the Union Square area is loud and stressful enough that the room doesn't need to be a sensory overload - if anything, they should try to make it as calming as possible. Do I really need a bed canopy held up by men's belts (and cheap looking ones I might add)? Do I really need a room the size of a postage stamp with a bathroom that's half the size of a Best Western? Do I really need to pay 50 BUCKS for overnight parking? Do I really need to pay more than $400 bucks for a night? The answer to all of the above is \"no!\" There are plenty of more affordable, hip hotels in San Francisco that offer what the Monaco does - and if you're willing to ride BART for about 20 minutes, you could stay at a much nicer version of a hip hotel in downtown Berkely for nearly a third of the money! (The Hotel Shattuck) One of the people in our party actually had the smoke detector beep loudly every 10 seconds starting around 3AM and the front desk said they couldn't fix it 'til the morning... they offered to switch rooms and finally offered my friends earplugs. At the Four Seasons or other expensive hotels, they would've been able to solve that problem without the guests being inconvenienced in the middle of the night! The one thing this hotel has over most others is a truly exceptional restaurant that's every bit as good as I remembered. From the perfect olive bread to hearty and declisious appetizers that you could make into a meal, to an ambiance that is worthy of a picture, this restaurant is everything the hotel rooms are not.

This is a nice hotel, and like all the reviews state, it is in a good central location to all the shopping and theater. The staff is very polite and accommodating. Our valet parking was quick and efficient as was check in and check out. Definitely 5* service. I have stayed at 5* hotels (ie Ritz's, Fairmonts, Four Seasons etc.) where the service has not been this good. If you like older, elaborate, quirky decor, this hotel is for you. The lobby is really pretty, as is the 20's style decor in the attached restaurant. Sadly we missed the wine reception, but we did try the restaurant which was quite good and like the hotel had nice service. As for the homeless people - San Francisco is full of homeless people, but they are harmless. Point is, you are most likely going to get some homeless people around your hotel in SF regardless of where you are staying - ie they hang out around all the 5* hotels too, not just this one. Despite all the great things about this hotel, I will likely not return. This has nothing to do with the hotel, but has to do with the fact that I have bad animal (cat and dog, and anything else with fur) allergies. Like everyone says, this is an extremely pet friendly hotel - as in any sized pet, no size restrictions. There are even pets behind the front desk. I know many hotels in SF are pet friendly, and most allow cats and small dogs, but if you are badly allergic to animals, I would steer clear of this hotel. I think pet owners purposely choose this hotel because it is so pet friendly - ie: there are no size restrictions, they give out doggie treats etc, etc. I am assuming there are a lot more animals in this hotel than there would be at other hotels in SF that have the size restrictions etc. When I booked our stay, I saw the overall positive reviews for this hotel on trip advisor, and just acted too quickly. I didn't read through the hotel's website or the reviews very thoroughly, so I didn't catch the whole pet thing until we'd prepaid and were checking in (my own fault). The staff was accommodating and put us on a pet free floor, but I was still a little bothered - ie woke up a little puffy eyed and congested. Not surprising as there is no way to prevent animal dander and fur from getting into the air and floating around. For me, this hotel was fine for a night, but it wouldn't have been good if we were there for a week. My own fault for not looking at the reviews and hotel website better, so I hope that any one with bad allergies who thinks they might be ok for an extended stay at this hotel reads this review. As a last comment, if you aren't expecting it, you might be surprised at how expensive the hotels and parking are in San Francisco at the end of the summer. ie - our 1 night stay here for a standard room with 2 double beds was well over $400 a night with tax and parking. If possible you may want to travel off season after the flood of European tourists leave the city. Rates in the late fall/winter are much better (and sometimes the weather isn't that much different).", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cStarted off not so great..but it ended well!!\u201d", "Author": "m_17kisses", "ReviewID": "UR117254499", "Content": "So we checked into this hotel just this last week.

Called and told them, someone came up and said Oh it was from previous guest ironing. Okay nice...she brought us slippers to use. Next morning I found that the carpet was even more wet and in the closet and to the first bed. We told front desk and they said to pack our stuff and they will move it later as they were full. When we came back that night our stuff was moved to another room and it was the room showed in the photo, we had two chairs and two benches at the end of the bed. It was a better sized room for 4 people and luggage. After we got into the room no problems and had a great stay! Free wireless internet, make sure to just sign up for their little thing when you connect and its free. Wine hour every night, awesome. Wines for free! and sparkling cider..and some food.....AND free back massages. There was a tv and a wii...a couple kids were playing some sports on it during wine hour. Thought that was cool. Morning, you have free coffee, tea and hot chocolate, it was all good. Jacuzzi was really nice, big too. Pet friendly hotel, so we got to see Oliver (dog) during wine hour..he was great.

This is a beautiful hotel. Kimpton is a first-class operation with reasonably priced boutique hotels. We got a very good rate ($168) by becoming a member of their \"In Touch\" club (free). There are other perks for \"In Touch\" members too. We were a little worried about the neighborhood. There are conflicting reviews of this part of town. We had not problems and the walk from the Powell St. BART station was quick and easy. However, it is on the very edge of the Union Square shopping district and the neighborhood deteriorates quickly if you walk west or south. After carrying our luggage all day, it would have been nice if they offered to help us with luggage. I assume the bell man was helping someone else, but I would have thought the front desk would have stepped up to help, but no offer was made. The restaurant (Grand Cafe) was very nice. A grand room with whimsical art work. Perhaps a bit pricey, but I rather expect that for a hotel restaurant. There was a free wine reception ever evening, which was quite nice. The free coffee service in the morning was very nice. Room was small, but again that is expected in an older place, and how much room does two people really need?. The TV needed upgrading. They had some trouble finding me a key for the mini-bar ($10 free stuff for In-Touch members). We also got a free bottle of wine for using the \"secret password\" when we checked in. The biggest problem was with the \"complimentary town car service to the financial district\" that is advertised on their web site. I asked 6 different people and got 6 different answers about this service, including \"it doesn't exist\", \"it isn't complementary\", \"it can't be reserved\", \"can be arranged at the front desk\". etc... In the end, despite previous assurances that it would work for us, the door man said \"No, you can't use it. The Ferry Building isn't in the Financial District\". So we took the bus.

A convenient Walgreen's is located directly across the street if you need any water, snacks or toiletries. Starbucks is a short walk away for a great quick breakfast. The hotel always had water and a special \"refresher\" drink in the lobby when you walked in if you needed something right then. Everyday at 5 pm the hotel offered a wine reception for one hour. It was advertised as a wine/beer/mixed drinks/sangria reception with chef inspired offerings. The chef inspired offering the night we went was pretzels - so a little bit of a let down. They were also only offering sangria, a white wine and a red wine. We still enjoyed the free beverages during the hour and thought it was a nice touch. Our room was great - perfectly sized for the four of us. Very nice thread count on the sheets, beds were great and we were given option of feather pillows, foam or cotton. Nice toiletries as well - Aveda products.

While the decor may be a little flamboyant for some tastes, it certainly provides a pleasant departure from the typical mainstream hotel experience. Monaco lobbies are feasts of color and theatrical flourishes, decked out with stylish furniture, bold fabrics and other touches which establish a cheerful tone. The presence of guests' well behaved dogs also lends a rather homey atmosphere to a clearly chic, upscale experience. Despite all the elegance, this is a mid-tier, mid-price hotel, an affordable luxury which provides quite a treat for a vacation or get-away weekend. The rooms carry on the color and drama of the lobbies and are very comfortable and well maintained. We have selected suites on each visit and find the extra space well worth the cost since the standard rooms have felt a little small at the Monaco's property in Denver. The standards of the hotel are quite high despite the moderate price point and all the amenities from the jazzy robes to large marble bathrooms to well chosen furniture reflect well on the management of this chain. The staff are wonderful and very professional. We especially approve of the room service and bar dining option at the Monaco. While the formal restaurant is there if you need it, its menu is unexceptional and there are better dining experiences all over San Francisco. The bar, however, is a very comfortable place to hang out and dine on an excellent selection of various bar foods from burgers to calamari to raw oysters. The presence of this bar dining option is a real plus in considering the Monaco since it takes all the pressure off the dinner hour when a major dining experience may not be required every night of your stay. Our one slight negative on this hotel is its location which is off Union Square rather than on it. While two extra blocks aren't a huge deal, the twentieth time you walk them could matter to you. Otherwise, the Monaco is an excellent choice near the very best part of a truly enchanting, vibrant city.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "contraltomo", "ReviewID": "UR115832531", "Content": "If you're in San Francisco you must go to this hotel.

As we were planing to attend a play and experience some night life we wanted to stay in the downtown/theater section of San Francisco. The Hotel Monaco is right on Geary Street, a main East/West thoroughfare that runs from Market Street to the ocean. The hotel is within a block of the A.C.T. Theater and many fine eateries are also a short walk or brief taxi ride away. This was our first stay at the Monaco. As we entered the hotel we were very impressed with the high domed ceilings that gives a sense of a vastness of space in the foyer and the adjacent spaces off of the lobby. Pictures of bi-planes and balloons are painted on the ceilings off of the entrance. The \"living room\" adjacent to the lobby is comfortable with overstuffed chairs and a long high back sofa. An evening happy hour is celebrated in this area. Once checked in we were welcomed by a brightly lit hallway featuring bright red walls when we arrived at our floor. Our room was just the right size and all of the expected sundries were included in this immaculate space. The view from our room did overlook a storage area for garbage dumpsters but we chose to look up and see just a bit of the downtown area. Although the view wasn't much, being at the back of the property insured a very quiet and peaceful couple of night's sleep. As with all of the hotels of this chain, the room furnishings are kitschy and a bit over the top. The room colors are bold. The wall paper was silver and black vertical stripes. There was what can best be described as an awning hanging directly over the bed and it was accessorized with pairs of mens' trouser belts. Believe me, I'm not making this up - just reporting what was there! A fun room. The entire hotel staff were very professional and it is apparent that they are proud to work at The Monaco. Adjacent and connecting to the Hotel Monaco is the Grand Cafe Bistro and Restaurant. We ate brunch at the Grand cafe and the food was very good Between five and seven the bar at the restaurant serves up some very tasty raw and baked oysters for about a buck-fifty per oyster, and we enjoyed a pre-night-on-the-town snack of oysters and champagne for a very modest sum.

We were hooked with that first stay and never consider another property when we come back to San Francisco, or any other cities where Kimpton's are. We have actually stayed at Kimpton's Hotel Monaco in Washington DC. The Hotel Monaco is our fourth Kimpton property in San Francisco my wife and I have stayed at in the last 4 visits we've made to this great city. We chose it on this visit for 2 reasons - The first was the size of the room we could get at the price range we were willing to spend. There was no question we were going to stay at a Kimpton; the question was what the best room we could get for our money. The second was the fact that we had been inside this hotels lobby on a previous visit and said we definitely wanted to stay on one of our next visits. The hotel lobby is, in one word, spectacular! Our room was a Canopy room and for what we needed the room for, it was perfect. This was a weekend getaway and we stayed for only 2 nights. We knew on this particular visit, we weren't going to be staying in our room very much. All we were looking for was a quiet room with a nice bathroom. If you are the type of traveler who likes to have a room you can hang out in and watch TV, then you probably should consider a bigger/different room or another hotel. If you\u2019re going to have more than a couple of suitcases and clothes for, say, a week, this probably won\u2019t do for you. I believe they have bigger rooms there but we didn\u2019t need one. For our needs, the 200 square feet was perfect! The bathroom was roomy enough for us and we felt that we could get dressed without stepping on each and had plenty of room for our suitcases and closet space for our clothes. Don't expect a sweeping panoramic city view either in the canopy room. It's a nice, comfortable hotel room with a great staff. If you want a view, get out and walk around - it's San Francisco after all! As for the hotel staff, they were the same great we've come to expect as Kimpton regulars. We had to ask for help with just about every aspect of our stay, like an early check-in & late check-out, dinner recommendations and reservations, and transportation to/from the airport and around the city. Everyone was just a tremendous help in making our stay a pure pleasure. But, in particular, I would like to say a special thank you to Mose. When my wife realized she did not bring a charger cord for her Blackberry, Mose went to another Kimpton property to get one for us. And then, told us to we could use for rest of our trip, take it home and just return it at the next Kimpton we stay at. No problem and we will. Just incredible service, thank you Mose! The location is only a couple of blocks away from Union Square where you can find the trolley or other public transportation to get you to other parts of the city. Chinatown is certainly within walking distance too. Cab rides to places like The Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf (The Buena Vista Cafe) are just a few dollars. A Taxi ride to/from SFO is a good 30 minutes and will cost you about $37. Considering that the cheapest shuttle is going to be about $32, it makes for the convenience of having choices to get to/from the airport so you can spend more time enjoying this city. Speaking of which, there are plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. My wife and I were very disappointed we didn't get to try the hotel's own Grand Cafe. We had heard good things about it and we have eaten at several Kimpton property restaurants and found them to be among the best in any city. We had planned to eat dinner there before our red-eye flight but were unable to make it back to the hotel in time. Oh well, next time, and yes there will be a next time! We loved everything about The Hotel Monaco. Make time in your stay for the Managers Wine Reception (they have it every Kimpton). We met some great people from Australia and the cupcakes they served (the cupcakes were a first, normally it's very tasty olives), and that's the type of thing you just can't get at a bigger chain. One thing that is never a surprise though is how Kimpton Hotels are always a wonderful part of our visits to the cities they are in.

We arrived on the early Sat morning flight (in the city by 8am) and had hoped to leave our bags at the hotel while we explored the city until afternoon check-in. We were most pleasantly surprised to learn that our room was not only ready but that they'd let us check in so early... score! The staff was most friendly and accommodating, offering to make transportation arrangements for us throughout our stay. The complimentary fresh spa water (strawberry, orange, etc) was a nice touch, along with the morning coffee bar and afternoon wine hour. The bathrooms were super clean and had plenty of available amenities. We didn't order room service but it was good to see a few yummy healthy options listed for each meal below the usual decadence. The only reason I took off a star (and would rate the experience Very Good vs Excellent) - Being a fan of spas of all kinds, I partially chose this hotel for the 24hr fitness room, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. We had inquired about the spa hours (9am-9pm, and someone could let us in after hours if necessary). I was mainly looking forward to relaxing in the warm sauna but was quite disappointed to find the sauna 'out of order'. Ok fine, managed to enjoy the steam & jacuzzi in it's place. The 2nd day there was a 'closed' sign on the jacuzzi as well. We called the front desk, who cited 'maintenance'. My husband saw the maintenance guy later, who mentioned they couldn't get the chemical balance right in the jacuzzi. Being Memorial Day weekend (and the fact that this is a Kimpton, known for their service and the hotel seemed pretty busy/full) I'm surprised this wasn't taken care of. Even on day 3 only the steam room was available. Overall, we were very pleased with the rooms, our stay and the service. Hopefully next time all the spa amenities will be available for enjoyment.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cMy accommodation was wonderful.

The hotel is like stepping back into the gilded era of the early 1900's with painted fresco ceilings, lattice-work railings, and massive fireplaces. The room itself faced Geary street , but was still fairly quiet - heard the occasional siren or engine. The room was decorated with funky green and yellow striped wallpaper and a large circular mirror in the sitting area with 2 Asian patterned chairs. There was a nice-sized functional desk between the beds and a large corner armoir that housed the TV and a mini-bar plus fridge. The bedding and pillows were some of the most comfortable I have come across on my travels. The bathroom was equipped with Aveda products, a hairdryer, plus cotton balls and q-tips. There was also a list of essentials the front desk would provide if needed. Plenty of room for 2 people. The front desk was outstanding with check-in, as well as sight-seeing and dining suggestions. I had emailed the concierge 2 nights before my stay to request 2 beds as a friend was able to join me - and the request was granted with a smile. The location is within walking distance (3 blocks) to Union Square and the Cable care and (5 blocks) to the gate of Chinatown. The doorman suggested not to venture to the west or south due to it being a rougher neighborhood and not as visitor-friendly. There is a very nice cafe (but expensive) adjacent to the hotel, as well as many dining options within a short walk. Our favorite for breakfast was a small diner at the corner of Geary and Mason (same side of street as hotel) and dinner was a time to venture out - had fabulous homemade raviolli at Scala's on Powell, and tasty chicken and broccoli at R and G in Chinatown along with the freshest fish of the trip!

But, I did have one annoying experience with the staff in the wee hours of a Sat. 9 April that was annoying. I ended up in SF for a week for a conference but was very ill with a cold the entire time. The rooms have no small coffee makers like many do. I rarely use this, but desperately needed one this time to make theraflu, which is the only cold-symptom medication that works well for me. I spent most of the week getting hot water (kindly given for free) from Starbucks across street. But at 4AM on Saturday morning, I coughed myself awake, couldn't sleep, & got desperate. I went down looking to see if the morning coffee I was promised at check-in was out yet. It wasn't. I explained to front desk how ill I was, showed them the theraflu packet I was desperate to make, and asked if they could please get me some hot water. Porter arrived in 15 minutes with hot water and no mug. I asked for one, the porter said: \"You have glasses, see!\" I said, \"no mugs, nothing with a handle\". He said: \"You have glasses.\" and left. I felt the easiest way not to make trouble was to go back downstairs and to get one of the mugs I'd seen out in big stacks in the coffee area downstairs. I got one, the front desk started saying: \"The porter will be there soon\". I said: \"Yeah, he came, but brought no mug for me; I came to get one\". Answer: \"Sir, don't take that mug. That's for a private function. You can't take that mug!\" The guy kept yelling as I entered the elevator; I half-expected him to chase me up to my room to retrieve this mug I'd \"stolen\" from the private function. Now, this is an *empty* mug. It belongs to the hotel. I'm taking it back to my room, at the hotel! Do they really have so few mugs that I can't borrow one to prepare my cold medication at 4AM? He's really going to yell at a \"mug stealing\" customer at 4:30AM who's already told him that he's very sick and desperately needs to prepare some symptom medicine?

On a previous visit, we had stayed at the Omni (GREAT hotel) near the Financial District, but on this visit we wanted to be a little closer to Union Square. Reading the reviews on Trip Advisor (as I always do) we settled on the Hotel Monaco. It turned out to be a great decision. During our cab ride from the airport, I explained to the driver where we had previously stayed and I asked him about the Hotel Monaco. He said that while, in his opinion, it wasn't quite the Omni, it was indeed a very nice place with a good reputation for service. He did, however, caution us that it was near the edge of the \"Tenderloin\" section of SF and that we should not venture too far in that direction, particularly at night. This, of course, mirrored several comments that I had seen in several Trip Advisor reviews when talking about the Hotel Monaco's location. In point of fact, however, the location (two blocks off of Union Square in the middle of the Theatre District) turned out to be one of the best things about the hotel. Convenient access to the cable cars, near Union Square, and within walking distance to the Westfield Mall. Knowing that we would be arriving before normal check-in, I had contacted the hotel to make arrangements for an early check-in. Communication was great and I had received an email from the Front Desk Manager assuring me that we could be accommodated. Sure enough, when we arrived (nearly three hours before normal check-in) our room was ready and available to us. Is that fantastic customer service, or what? (Thank you Christine.) The room was clean, smartly decorated, and the beds were very comfortable. The nightly hosted wine hour was a very nice touch.

From 5-6 was the wine reception with free massages on offer. There was also a Wii to play. I thought this was a fabulous little touch after a long day of sightseeing. We got to meet a great variety of people and dogs! The only negative thing about this hotel was the breakfast. I had been traveling around the USA for a while and everywhere I booked there was at least continental breakfast in the offer. To me that meant your basic pastries etc but where you could help yourself. At the Monaco you are unable to help yourself and are given a tiny plain croissant, chocolate croissant and a small bowl of fruit.

It was really a wonderful trip I had to San Francisco. It was my 3rd business visit to San Francisco in California and as usual it was one of the best trip out of my 2 earlier trips. I took my flights from LAX to SFO on September, 9, 2010. I book my flight from Expedia and it was a nice deal I had from them. I had to look for the hotels as well that I actually did not find good on expedia, so I google and found hotels2stay.net and I got the best hotel rates for San Francisco and I quickly book my hotel room as it was discount going on on 3rd night. It was a free night if I stay for 2 nights, I get the 3rd night free of cost. So It was really good and I got my flight and hotel done. Thanks to expedia and hotels2stay.net for the best flight and hotel deal. When I reached my hotel in San Francisco (Hotel Monaco San Francisco - a Kimpton Hotel) I realized that I have lost my hotel booking print out at my desk in Los Angeles. It was embarrassing moment for me, but fortunately I had my notebook with me where I had just login to my email account and took another print out of the hotel booking confirmation that I had received from hotels2stay. And everything was again on track. I had been transferred to my deluxe king room with everything in the room. Fabulous hotel room it was. My room was nicely decorated and comfortable bedding was there. Walls were well painted and covering with wall paper. I did enjoy complimentary wine at 5 O Clock nightly in the lounge downstairs. It was my 2 business meeting back to back 2 days so I get up early and Next day my meeting has been fixed with client on the phone. I left early to my meeting and came back in 3 to 4 hours. Now I had time to enjoy the hotel luxury. I was really excited with the kind of facilities they have in the room. I enjoy minibar and video game a lot, as Love these 2 things. I enjoy free surfing of the internet free of cost at it is available in the entire hotel and there is no charge for this. In the night I had my dinner in Grand Caf\u00e9 and went to sleep around 11PM. Next 2 days just vanished with the client meeting and I did not get much time to be there in the hotel but the 1st and 2nd day I really enjoy being there. I check out from the hotel on 12th of September and I was really experience to stay.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cA Good San Francisco Experience\u201d", "Author": "Flash98", "ReviewID": "UR84971933", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights at the Monaco with our 9 year old daughter.

My favourite things about the hotel are the attentiveness of staff, cleanliness, location, free Wifi, Wine hour/reception, and the great restaurant / bar (Grand Cafe) inside the hotel. As with most hotels there isn't an included breakfast but there are plenty of places just along Geary as you head towards Union Square. They're all similar priced, and for just two people we had to spend between $20 and $30 for sit down breakfast which is not great if you're travelling for a whole month and on a budget like us. We thought the room was great. Bed was very comfy. I would agree with some that the room was smaller than other rooms we have stayed in, but not too small. Our cases fitted around the bed fine, and the bathroom was fine. The decor was kind of chic , and we had to chuckle when we saw the bath robes. Generally we had a great nights sleep here. Location is very convenient with Union square just 2 blocks east, and you're only a few blocks from BART, Muni and cable car stations. There also a Wallgreens opposite the hotel on Geary which we used to buy bottled water (and avoiding paying $5 each for the ones in the hotel room). The hotel is on the edge of the Tenderloin area, but its in a busy area so we felt safe walking along the street at night. I guess my advice is don't walk west and you'll be fine. As for homeless people, you will find them on practically every street corner in san francisco, but most seem to be polite and leave you alone. The Grand Cafe was wonderful to have inside the hotel. It is definitely grand, very stylish and relaxing, and has some attentive staff making wonderful cocktails, serving oysters and other great food. We particularly approved of their happy hour! The hotel staff were very helpful. We had a lot of luggage and the door men and bell service were great. They had all of our bags brought from the cab to our room whilst we got settled. On checkout they let us leave our bags whilst we picked up our hire car. When we came back with the car we waited outside whilst they brought the luggage out and helped load it all into the trunk for us! I was very pleased. The only minor problem with our stay was that our room key-cards deactivated on two occasions, once on the day of check-in and once on our third day. Both the room porter and the lady at the reception gave us the same explanation saying to keep the keys away from any electronic devices, however I explained that we did and this happened simultaneously on both cards on both occasions. I suspect a computer fault or manual error on their system. Hopefully they'll get this sorted out in future.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cFABULOUS hotel -- outstanding staff, rooms, amenities -- all around fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "KVincent", "ReviewID": "UR78279338", "Content": "I commute weekly from LA to SF and the Hotel Monaco is truly my home away from home.

The staff were fabulous. The hot and cold coffee bar in the AM was great. They offer lemonade and iced tea in the PM and then from 5pm-6pm there is a free wine happy hour with free massages. Very nice touch. The rooms were decent (started in the king room which was spacious; ended up later in queen room which was definitely smaller but still nice). Both rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. Here are my lessons learned. #1 - request a room that is an interior room. You do not want a room that faces either Geary or Taylor. They are very busy roads with lots of traffic, but the worst part is all the action that continues to occur both at night and in the early AM. You will hear them pick up trash on Friday morning (around 6am), you will hear deliveries being made, when the drunk people are leaving the local bar you will hear them yelling, and you will hear the street cleaning in the early AM. We had 2 nights of this and I finally asked to be moved. They were wonderful and accommodated my request, although I had to take a lesser room...it was worth it. My 2nd lesson learned is that I'm not sure if Union Square was the right location for my hotel given my itinerary. We were constantly in a cab going to other areas. Union Square is perfect if you plan to shop, but our plans included biking the Golden Gate Bridge, going to Napa, going to Alcatraz and taking a Taste of Italy walking tour. My comment here is no reflection on the hotel...this is simply a matter of what we were chosing to do. I was in San Fran during the 4th of July weekend and I can tell you Fisherman's Wharf was an absolute mass of humanity. I wouldn't want any part of that area either. I will say the Hotel Monaco was not insane with people during the holiday and I did appreciate that. Again, for you shoppers, if you stay here you are 2 blocks from major shopping. You are also 2 blocks from picking up the cable car. I recommend you start at the very end of the cable car line so that you have a chance to get a decent seat. If you try to pick up the car mid route, you may or may not be able to get on.

They list the square footage of all the rooms on their website which is good info to have--so I was forewarned. The canopy bed took up about half the floor space. There was also room for a night table, desk, lounge chair and the cabinet with TV and minibar. The canopy bed has some cushions and wall lighting and can double as a sofa.

Kensington Park is another one that I like a lot when the price is right. I don't like to pay over $140 a night to stay in SF. I stayed at Hotel Monaco for five days with my husband while he was attending MacWorld over Valentine's Day weekend. We paid $144 for every night except one, which was $195. The Good: Clean, quiet and gorgeous with excellent service. The friendly staff made us feel very comfortable. I loved that the cleaning crew was quiet in the mornings. I didn't hear anything in the hallways. I can't stand it when I hear the maids yelling to each other in the halls. Hello! I'm on vacation - trying to sleep here! The front desk staff booked the perfect place for a business dinner we were hosting. It was exactly what we wanted. The staff know the city well, which is tough with all of the excellent options in SF. For Kimpton members, they have free Wifi. I consider that essential at any hotel. They even gave us a voucher for $10 worth of goods from the minibar, which was well stocked with lots of different choices. I loved that they had a DVD player and stereo with CD's in the room. I didn't have to play everything off of the computer. I fell in love with our goldfish. The location is excellent. Walking distance to BART. Not too close to Union Square so it's quiet and not too far out of the Theater District to be in the Tenderloin. Walking distance from the two best diners in the city (Pinecrest and Dotty's). The free cocktail hour, hot chocolate at 2:00 and morning coffee and tea bar in the lounge by the fireplace were fantastic. They had Wii set up to play one night and another night we watched the Olympics. It's all the little things that make this place so fun to stay in. Could Use Improvement: I ordered oatmeal with raisins and brown sugar from Room Service. I was given only oatmeal with four raisins and nothing else. When I order room service, for $16 (after charges), I expect to be given several different condiment options with my order, in addition to what is listed on the menu of course. Room Service promptly fixed their mistake. The guy was at my door in under three minutes. Still, no milk, no butter, no extra raisins...have these people never eaten oatmeal before? So, the room service is pretty lame. Lastly, I agree with the person who said that their pillows are funky. They are like too puffy. I had a hard time sleeping on them the first night but, then I got used to it. And was way too comfortable in that bed because I took about 100 naps. I couldn't get the radio/ iPod player to work - but that may have been user error/the iPhone wouldn't work with it. Other than that, I loved this hotel. It's gorgeous and next time I hope to take advantage of the gym and in-room massage.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, superb staff, only a few minor things can be improved\u201d", "Author": "MarijkeLondon", "ReviewID": "UR56002612", "Content": "On the plus side: The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times, and even printed my boarding pass for me with the seat I wanted. The wine hour is nice if you happen to be in the hotel at 5pm. The room (we had the suite) was spacious and I would recommend booking this as the normal rooms are average size but can get noisy (see below). The restaurant downstairs is expensive but the food is good. The location is great as Union Square with Muni and bart services is just down the road as well as the cable cars, shopping and restaurants. For those who like pets, they are allowed and reception is permanently occupied by a golden retriever. The spa is lovely with small whirlpool, steamroom, and sauna. Very comfy bed. On the minus side: If you book a normal room, be prepared for a noisy night. We had the suite and I was glad we could close the door to shut out any hallway noises (people just love slamming hotel doors) and the fridge which is very loud. There are no tea or coffee making facilities which is really annoying as I had to dash to Starbucks a few times. A cup of tea on room service was $8.50! The spa is great but the steamroom smelled like a steam iron so didnt have a nice eucalyptus smell, and the sauna only had heat so felt more like roast chicken than relaxing sauna as there was no option to add water. There is a business centre but you have to pay about $6 to use the Internet for 15 mins which is extremely expensive. Wireless is also charged unless you register to their website.

This year, instead of going to the Modern Language Convention and having the opportunity to try another interesting hotel in Philadelphia, we decided to return to the Hotel Monaco. It was just that good and we had to see it they could maintain those standards. Not only were they maintained, but in my estimation, they were enhanced. The hotel is just so cozy and comfortable, especially with the fireplace. Although the rooms can be small, they are quite well appointed. Last year I had opportunity to stay in both a smaller queen bed room and then a beautiful larger king bed room, but this year I just stayed in a smaller room and it was quite fine. As comfortable as they hotel is, the strongest suit has to be the warm, accommodating staff. Actually, one should have very few needs while staying at the Monaco, but it comforting to sense that the staff is receptive. At the Monaco, it would be much easier to attempt to highlight someone who might not be doing a fabulous job, as opposed to listing the people who are wonderful because virtually everyone you encounter is worthy of positive notice. I must mention, though, that I remember Francess and Tim R.A. Now fondly from last year and must note that it speaks well of the hotel that they maintain such fine employees. Also Jian's positive nature and helpfulness really stood out as well. I did notice that the previous reviewer mentioned appreciation about the Monaco being a dog friendly hotel. Actually I am not a dog person, particularly not a big dog person. Unlike last year, when there were no dogs and, as far as pets, all I heard about was the fact that goldfish are available to keep in the room, this year big dogs seemed to be ubiquitous and I could envision most of the owner's wearing invisible versions of the \"dogs are the new kids\" t-shirts.

I am so glad I did! The hotel itself was beautiful and well maintained. The staff was exceedingly friendly and helpful. We booked a double double room for our teenage daughters and a deluxe queen for my husband and myself. We were able to get an early check in at 12pm for the girls room. When we came back later to check into our room we found we had also been put in a double double ( which is larger and more expensive ) instead of a queen. The desk said they had upgraded us at no charge but if we would prefer a queen they would be happy to move us. We decided to stay put since the room was bigger and nice, but I would have liked to see what the queen looked like. Unfortunately, our girls ended up with a bigger room and bathroom than we did! I did peek in a few rooms from the hallway as they were being cleaned and they seemed to vary in size and/or layout. I had been worried about room size because many reviews on San Fran hotels, in general, say that rooms are small, but we found these to be comfortable and large enough. We loved the decor and the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. They have a stocked minifridge in every room but you can move stuff out of the way to put your own food and drinks in. The cleaning staff was very nice and accomodating. Its a pet friendly hotel but there was no problem with pet odors.The only complaint we had was that there was a lot of clanging noise from the street early in the mornings that could be heard very loudly from our 3rd floor streetside rooms. Don't know what was going on down there! They have a complimentary wine reception every evening that was very well attended by guests. Its supposed to run from 5-6pm but I often saw it going on until closer to 7. Also during wine hour they offer free 10 minute massages and they have a large screen and Wii game set up. Location was great. Two blocks from the cable cars and right on the bus line. We bought a 7 day transportation pass to use on cable cars, streetcars, and buses which paid for itself in 2 days. Easy to get around on public transportation and walking distance to many attractions. There is a dicey area about 2-3 blocks away called the Tenderloin district, but its easy to stay away from because most attractions are in the other direction. I would highly recommend joining the Kimpton Club after you make your reservation because they periodically offer special deals by email to members. I was able to rebook the rooms twice for a savings of about $700 overall.

As noted in other reviews, the Queen Deluxe rooms are REALLY small \u2013 there is only one other spot to sit other than the bed, which is at the desk. The small room is usable but if you need more space it would be wise to consider one of their larger rooms. The staff at this hotel is one of the best I\u2019ve run across anywhere \u2013 every request I had was taken care of within minutes, from a non-functioning TV remote to wireless internet access instructions. I\u2019ve never stayed at a Kimpton property before, but I\u2019m a fan after this stay. The decoration is really fabulous and feels kind of \u201cfunky posh.\u201d Another reviewer mentioned hideous wallpaper in some of the rooms and I do have to agree on that point, during my stay I saw the interior of several rooms when they were being cleaned and not all have that nauseating yellow/green striped wallpaper. It\u2019s an off-note in a hotel that is otherwise so beautifully decorated. The gold/red in the bathroom is much more pleasing. The bed and linens are first rate and extremely comfortable. Towels in the bathroom could be a little bigger and plusher \u2013 they also have a faint smell of having been laundered with the kitchen towels from the restaurant. I wish hotels would figure out that they have to keep those carefully separated. I also found my room to be pleasantly quiet \u2013 the hotel was full but I never once heard other guest voices or Television noise while in my room (my perennial complaint at hotels..having to listen to the TV from the room next door.) The old style windows actually open to provide fresh air (there is no AC, but not really needed in San Fran unless it\u2019s experiencing a rare heat wave.) Even with the windows closed there was only a faint occasional sound of the usual city sirens wailing. The hotel really needs to be clearer about their spa. What the website currently does not explain is that the spa downstairs is open (Jacuzzi, steam room, sauna) to guests but has to be unlocked for each use since the hotel does not have an attendant on duty. Treatments (facials/massages) are all being done directly in guests rooms while they finish the spa renovation. I didn\u2019t use the fitness center due to a recent injury but it looked well appointed with a variety of machines, yoga mats and free weights. Of the several times I used the spa, I was usually the only guest there (the spa facility is co-ed, so bring a suit.) There is a changing room with a shower and plenty of fresh towels. The in-room safe is easy to use. The honor bar does have a small refrigerator, but it is fully packed and you\u2019ll have to pull stuff out of it in order to use it for personal supplies. Once I got the WiFi figured out, it was a breeze and speeds were reasonable for wireless. I love hotels that provide an iHome in the room, so a big Thank You to Kimpton for that treat! The wine reception between 5 and 6 pm each day is very popular, but they end promptly at 6, so don\u2019t be late! There are no coffee makers in the rooms, but the downstairs coffee arrangement in the morning is plenty sufficient. The hotel will deliver the NY Times to your door every day (and charge you for it) unless you specifically ask them not to. Very wasteful for a supposedly \u201cgreen\u201d hotel. Across the street is a Walgreens for supplies and small grocery. San Fran is expensive; expect everything to cost 25-30% more than back home. Even the greasy-spoon diner down the street had outrageous prices, I don\u2019t know how people traveling with kids ever afford San Francisco. The Grand Caf\u00e9 restaurant attached to the hotel calls itself French-California (translation: Hip French) and has seriously excellent food. There are a few moderately priced items on the menu but expect to drop some coin, especially on wine or cocktails. It has a great atmosphere and an equally stellar staff as the hotel does (although it does sport some of the ugliest statuary I\u2019ve run across. I\u2019m certain somebody somewhere considers those \u201cart\u201d but, eye of the beholder and all that\u2026.) Being in the Theatre District, the restaurant is fairly popular with the pre and post theatre crowd (dinner before, dessert and drinks afterward.)

It was a steal. The '4' score rather than a '5' relates to some staffing issues and need for a bit more employee training. Although everyone was very nice, the whole front office was short staffed (front desk, bellman, doorman, valet) leading to lines, a lot of guests standing around waiting, every phone call being put on hold, etc. Overall I thought the employees handled it well, but there was a lack of efficiency that I wasn't expecting. Maybe it's the former hotel front office manager in me, but I'd like to see more eye contact and recognition from the employees. A bellman and a manager of some sort had a conversation for several minutes while I was standing 5 feet from them waiting to retrieve some bags, and not once did either of them look over and acknowledge that I was waiting. I'm very patient and not easily annoyed, but it got to the point where it was ridiculous and I couldn't believe that they were going on and on as another guest and I just stood there. I was also told to call 15 minutes in advance for my car, and after coming outside after 15 minutes, stood there for another 20 minutes until it finally arrived. Another time I went to pick up the car without calling and there wasn't a doorman or any employee outside helping any guests for at least 5 minutes. You get the point...

Even though it was only for 1 night we found our stay at this hotel to be the most pleasant of the 3 nights we stayed in SF. The reception service was personalized, friendly and thorough - even though we got in early (1pm), she was able to check us in right away. We had booked the room on Priceline - and she mentioned that they will do pricematching next time (& I think one reviewer mentioned this as well). The room is not huge - as expected in a boutique city hotel, but we enjoyed the decor of our room, nice bed and the Aveda products. & very clean of course. (though we weren't as excited about the leopard skin pattern bath robes...mainly because it had been washed out a bit and wasn't so fluffy..) We found it to be very service oriented and traveler friendly - for them to list out what additional bathroom amenities you could request for free (ex. tooth brush) and what other items you could request for a fee. They have complimentary wine receptions from 5-6pm - and unfortunately we missed the reception. However, we were further delighted to find out that we could still enjoy a complimentary glass of the featured wine at the hotel's restaurant (Grand Cafe). This was such a lovely perk to a long day of walking up and down the hills of SF. We tried out the Grand Cafe restaurant for dinner - we noticed that the menu looked interesting and we were also too tired to walk much more that evening. The dining area in the back is actually very airy and spacious which we found to be nice and relaxing as well. The restaurant did not disappoint. We had a nice gnocchi dish and we also enjoyed the appetizers. Recommend the restaurant. One more comment about their service: When we were rushing to leave - to catch a morning flight out of SFO, my boyfriend had misplaced his I-Pod and we couldn't find it. We looked under the bed etc but ran out of time so we left. When we were checking out, we mentioned this to the receptionist and she gave us a card to call later for lost and found. We did after arriving back to NYC and there was nothing reported by the cleaning staff in our room, however the man personally went to check again and called us back right away!! He had found it well hidden under the dressor - and the cleaning staff didn't even catch it.

I found a great deal on line and called the hotel and they matched the price. I booked a Queen Canopy room and also joined the Kimpton Hotel club. I received an email from the hotel about a week before we arrived asking if we were coming for anything special, needed anything, or if we had any questions. I told her how this was our first time away from our kids and that we were celebrating my husband finishing his huge licensure exam. I also asked for a couple of suggestions on restaurants for Chinese and Italian food. I received a very detailed email back with many ideas and suggestions. We tried two of the restaurants suggested and both were outstanding. When we arrived at the hotel we were informed that they upgraded us to a Queen Suite! What a wonderful surprise! Another huge perk of the Hotel Monaco was the 5-6pm complimentary wine in the lobby every evening. We ended up making it back for the wine each evening and it was a wonderful chance to relax and talk about all the sight-seeing we had done that day. After relaxing we were always ready to head out and find a great place to eat dinner and spend the rest of our evening. We also were able to mingle with other hotel guest and have enjoyable conversations. A couple of things about the area that we found helpful is that the trolley is only a few blocks away. Also the bus system is very efficient after you get the hang of the route system. It took us a day and a half before we got a hold of a good bus map, so if you plan on using the bus system I would recommend seeking a good map out right away. The buses come every 5-10 minutes and we got all over town very quickly.

There is a fitness room, a spa, a business center (though I must suggest that the hotel install the Wordperfect converter on their Word software, I couldn't open my document this morning) that has both Mac and PC's. Also, the hotel is always nicely decorated (beautiful, in fact, at Christmas) and the salon where the nightly wine happy hour is held is comfortable with a fire place and overstuffed furniture.

The old buildings just are not that large to allow for huge spaces no matter the price ( Unless you are a big fish and can pay for the penthouse). That being said and having stayed in many hotels in SF, this place is great and a favorite. What I like: The staff- Very friendly and helpful. Not trendy or snobby like the Clift Hotel across the street. Perks- Wine and cheese every night, and the staff goes out of the way to make your stay comfortable. The rooms- Clean and recently remodeled and decent sized (for SF), modern whimsical design and comfortable. Quiet if you ( again like any big city hotel) ask ahead for such a room (upper floor or back of hotel not facing street) I recommend the King rooms. You can pay a fortune and stay at the Ritz and the rooms won't be much larger- really, I have. The lobby and dining room- warm and fabulous if you like eclectic high style design. It is not traditional and I love that. The location - As a former SF'er, I think this is a perfect location as it is short walk to Union square, theater, cable car, or a small cab fare to anything. Some other hotels are on top of Nob Hill and can be a pain (literally) if you like to city walk back home after dinner or shopping. My wife and I personally walk all over SF from here and never feel unsafe. Beggars, massage parlors, various seedy characters are all over SF like NY or any major metropolis of this kind.

Ay, there's the rub. Now imagine that workers from a local brothel and circus became shareholders in the place and inserted their own flare every once in awhile throughout the joint. Put it all together and NOW you can envision the Hotel Monaco San Francisco. The bellmen look like pimps in purple velvet suits and hats. (I honestly thought I was being propositioned when one of them startled me from behind as I got out of the cab.) The bedrooms have two terry cloth bathrobes, one in zebra print the other leopard. The lamps in the rooms will remind you of the circus with their big block letters, and for some strange reason if you have a room with a canopy, the material and position of it will make it seem as though you are sleeping in a puppet theater. In the evenings you can head downstairs for a very strange happy hour that includes free wine, chair massages, and tarot card readings......I repeat tarot card readings!

So, what was bad? Well, there are very few rooms with King beds and so we didn't get one and slept in a queen for 5 nights. The rooms are also very small. The ice machine is on a different floor, and personally, I think the pimped out bellmen are creepy. Also, the attached restaurant is French with very heavy food and poor service. I've been to France, I find the people lovely. The waiters at this place epitomized an old stereotype of French waiters: snooty and lacking in service. Oddly, it's as if they were trying to put on that air. But, there is no end to great food in The City, so it didn't matter that much, we just didn't go there again. The good?

My daughter of 11 really enjoyed that. They even put a sign with the fish: \"Hello, my name is Gunther\" which we found very funny. The only thing is that on the 3rd day when we came back in our room the fish had died... My daughter was very sad. That evening a new fish arrived, but this one didn't give the pleasure that Gunther gave her!!", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cToo little for too much\u201d", "Author": "divarose1", "ReviewID": "UR8369742", "Content": "The lobby, bar and restaurant are beautiful.

The bed was comfortable, the shower had good water pressure and lots of hot and cold water, the food in the restaurant lovely (as again were the staff) and the goldfish a great help in setling us in! The first night of wine and cheese great with lots of couples and individual travellers chatting to each other but not so good on other nights when large parties of conference groups were there talking only amongst themselves.

The complimentary wine hour is nice. The cons...I booked our room in March (4months in advance). We get checked into our room, which was a queen canopy and actually a good size. We were so exhausted, we just hit the bed when we got there. The next day, I noticed the hallway smelled like stale smoke. Well guess what? WARNING The 7th floor is 1/2 smoking, which means all smoking. I called and the Front Desk moved us the next day into another room, literally the size of a postage stamp. WARNING 3rd floor is the postage stamp. When these people say small as the con, they ARE NOT kidding. I have been to every major city in the country and never imagined SMALL could actually be SO SMALL...So I called back, she said there was nothing else availabe, so I asked to be moved back to our \"not smoking side of the smoking floor room\". I could deal with the foul stench better than the clausterphobia I got in that room. The staff was nice. I feel like they give bad service politely, but it's still bad service. They said they would put an iodizer in our room to help with the smell, of course they didn't. At this point, I realized that contacting the front desk is pointless.

After all, I am out all day at meetings - the joy of my stay is for the 'down time'. The Monaco does an especiallly good job, for a fair price, in a highly competitive SF hotel market. I arrived on a Sunday afternoon, after 12 hours of flight delays. What the hotel provided me in those first 8 hours summed up why I will return to the Monaco. Gym/spa - like many hotels, the gym itself is small, but sufficient if you want to lift weights, with 3 plasmas to look at. For cardio, bring the running shoes and head North 4 blocks to Nob Hill, where you enjoy great Bay views and PLENTY of cardio hills. The best part of their gym is in the back - their Spa has a great steam room, and whirlpool, and hot sauna, all in a small, quiet Zen-like environment. Thanks for putting lemon in the drinking water. Comfort - I asked upon check in, and received for $30 more, a deluxe upgrade - it's worth every dollar getting the sofa and extra sq. feet. I'm over 6' tall and a mini claustophobic. Sign up for Kimpton Intouch before you book. I had a nice personal note from the Staff, a tall bottle of water and some chocolates waiting in my room upon check-in - just an example of the extra details a boutique provides. The King bed is firm, yet comfortable, with plenty of goose down pillows. Free, fast WiFi, and attractive decor added to a very comfortable room. Quiet - As for noise, my room was on the 4th floor facing Geary. With the windows shut, the sound proofing is adequate. I went to sleep at 10pm my first night and never had any traffic or guests waking me up. The guests I saw were older, not 20 somethings seeking hip and clubs - they stay down the street at the Clift. Touches - the lounge area has complimentary wine and cheese in the afternoon and Starbucks coffee and tea beginning at 6am, there are complimentary WSJ and SF Chronicles on your floor by the elevator, daily baked cookies at the front desk, and the staff is consistently friendly - not the typical empty attitudes you get from larger hotels (or New York). Neighborhood tips - If you want breakfaxt before 7am, take a right, go to the 2nd light, turn Rt and Lori's Diner is on the left - The California omlet is especially good. I got a great haircut before my meetings for $9 - turn Left out the door up 1 block, cross Jones. It's on the left, about 1/2 way up that block - it will say $9 on the window. You'll pass 2 salons on the way - one was $25, the other $30 - keep walking - these nice Korean women did a great job at 1/3 the price. Like Thai? Left out the door, 2 blocks up on the right.

We had expected to get a room in a more corporate type of hotel like the Hyatt or Hilton so we were absolutely thrilled to end up here. Last week, we returned to San Francisco on a business/pleasure trip and paid the going rate to stay at The Clift Hotel. We were so disappointed with that that we checked out early and moved back into the Monaco. The Hotel Monaco is as warm in its hospitality as it is in its decor. Service here is formal but not stuffy: the staff are courteous, professional and have a sense of humour. The door men are real characters who always greet you as you enter and leave, and leap energetically into the street to flag down a passing cab. I feel really pampered here, with the warm cookies at check in, the complimentary wine and cheese hour every evening, the luxurious spa and your own pet goldfish to keep you company in your room. Yes, the rooms are a little small, but they are so beautifully and individually decorated that it really doesn't matter. The public rooms are sumptuous - the fireplace and the painted ceilings in the lobby are particularly stunning. The Grand Cafe boasts wonderful French fare at reasonable prices and is perhaps one of the most magnificent dining rooms in the city. The Petit Cafe has delicious cheap food and is a fun bar for after dinner drinks. It's just a shame that it closes so early during the week - by 11pm. This is not a cheap hotel but then no hotel of this class is in San Francisco and it certainly represents much better value than its next door neighbour, The Clift. Unlike some other reviewers, I haven't stayed in any other Klimpton Hotels so I can't compare, but do I think The Hotel Monaco in San Francisco stands on its own merits.", "Date": "September 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cThis place is the best!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2569833", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for Memorial Weekend 2004.

The 5pm wine and cheese reception is pleasant and for a suggested donation you can receive a shoulder/neck message or a tarot card reading. Arrive early for sign up. The hotel is convenient to Union and also the BART station at Powell. Traveled quite easily from SFO on the BART and walked everywhere. Just plan ahead and have your map ready. We checked out the lobbies of the other Kimpton hotels we came upon, but glad we picked the Monaco. Someone always greeted us when we left for the day or for dinner and when we returned. The best place by far to have breakfast is at Dottie\u2019s True Blue Cafe, right around the corner of the hotel. Yes, you do enter the beginnings of the Tenderloin district and there are a few frightening homeless people, etc. However, exit the hotel left and walk around the corner (Jones Street) it's just down a few doors down.
