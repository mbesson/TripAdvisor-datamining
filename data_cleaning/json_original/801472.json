When we arrived off the coach it took forever to find the place, we were on the right street but could find no marquee for hotel or sign, we walked up and down the street several times, we asked a few people and they couldnt help, we finally asked in a shop and they pointed it out, it was a small door way with a tiny plaque on the wall with the name, we rang the bell and walked up stairs to be greeted by a guy sitting at a tiny desk in a hallway (reception) we were shown our room, tiny room with 2 single and very uncomfortable beds, the toilet was ok but still had hairs on walls of shower from last guest. The room was very very noisey and i have to say we didnt feel like we were in a very safe area of the city after dark. there was a nice restaurant across the road. it ruined our first day as i felt so guilty for booking this for my friend, it was just a nasty little hotel. the breakfast was ok, coffee/tea, some breads and spreads, plus cakes and orange juice. it was all my own fault for not doing home work on the place and just taking the website at its word. its handy for Termini (about 10-14min walk to Termini) and the hop on hop off buses which we found great for navigating the city, esp since it was out first visit. after day 2 came alone we just decided not to let the hotel state drag us down, and enjoyed the rest of the trip. if you want a place, close to the station, are not weary of the area your staying in and have little standards about your hotel room then stay here, i wouldnt go back, there is much better for budget traveler so look around, dont take the hotel website at its word. You could find much better than this place (sorry hotel owners, the reality didnt live up to the websites version of the hotel)", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cTERRIBLE - VERY DIRTY, SMALL, GHETTO LOCATION - HOROR\u201d", "Author": "Aives", "ReviewID": "UR66706727", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel from 4. 6. to 6. 6. 2010.

Once we got there, we realized it was NOTHING like what was described online. The \"flat screen\" tv was a basic tv that did not even work! The \"mini bar\" was an empty small fridge. The closet had a plastic box in it, I guess that was to be our dresser? Not really sure about that one! We had NO hot water... Could not even get it to be luke warm. The area was not the best I have seen. The hard wood floors were so filthy that we wore socks and they were black on the bottom after one night! We had our son with us, the room was so small that he had no where to play, but even if he had, we would not have allowed him on the floor. After checking in, we IMMEDIATELY headed out to find a better hotel. The \"lobby\" was the (I guess) owner sitting at a small table with a laptop computer and a tv monitor that was on the camera at the front door. We would up having to stay there for 2 nights as nothing else was available. After 2 nights, we left and went to a better hotel...

Although in a pretty unfriendly neighborhood (mostly Chinese and Indian immigrants and a very \"vivid\" nightlife) that may shock you a little, not compatible with the idea that one might have of Rome, the hotel is central enough and very conveniently located, close to Termini station (maximum 15 minutes on foot, but you may also take the tram - line 5 or 14) and well connected to all the tourist attractions, both by metro (on line A) and by tram or bus (the bus and tram stop is just in front of the hotel), which makes it a bit noisy during the night (probably the rooms are not very well isolated). Speaking of location, there is also a nice traditional restaurant right in front of the hotel and a supermarket one block away. The hotel itself, as the name says it, has only a few small (about 9-12 square meters but most of the hotels, even superior class hotels, have very small rooms) and basic rooms but well enough decorated, offering not more than the exact comfort that you need after a day of visiting the tourist attractions (which can be very tiresome): a clean bathroom for a hot shower (hairdryer, 3 clean towels that are changed everyday, soap and shower gel), a big comfortable bed with clean sheets and a flat TV in front (Italian channels only), a small place to hang your cloths and store your luggage as no closet available, a small fridge to cool your drinks, a safe and AC. Although at first sight everything seems very clean, a closer look may reveal some footprints on the white walls and a bit of mold between the bathroom tiles but that did not bother us, as the hotel was better than most of the 2 stars hotels we've stayed in. Breakfast, although not very rich, is served in your room between 7.30 and 9.30 and it consists in 1 cup of coffee or cappuccino, a croissant, a few biscotti, a little chocolate cake, 2 slices of bread, jam and butter. However, given the quantity of sugar in those products, it gives you enough energy to start the day and your sightseeing in shape. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, providing a map of Rome and touristic materials, always smiling and polite, answering all our questions and giving us all the necessary information. Although the check-in is normally made at 2 pm and we arrived at 10 am, they had no problem in accepting an early check-in at noon and offered to store our luggage until the room was ready. Overall, they left us with a good impression and we would definitely recommend this nice little hotel to everybody traveling to Rome on low budget, especially when going sightseeing for a few days. By the way, if you plan to visit a lot of tourist attractions in a short period of time, make sure you have a pain relief gel for your feet as you will definitely need it!", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cNot in the best area of Rome\u201d", "Author": "rebelscum", "ReviewID": "UR31392039", "Content": "Recently stayed at the Piccola Locanda in Rome for 4 nights.

We never found the building illustrated. However the taxi drivers know it .A small doorway,entryphone,wnding stairs, reception in a small cubbyhole. However the rooms are very clean,the beds comfortable,fluffy white towels,a fridge and all the awful Italian TV you can bear to watch on LCD TV and air conditioning. No wardrobe or chest of drawers just a short rack with a few coat hangers. Breakfast served in your room is adequate,the coffee very good. A really good base to explore ancient Rome as the Quirinale Hill ,where the hotel is situated,was the posh end of ancient Rome. A short walk to the Colliseum,the Forum etc. Near the Termini railway and bus stations and metro lines.Trams run past the front of the hotel and can be noisy if the window is open,but good automatic blinds cut out the noise at night.

When we arrived - our cab driver quickly determined that the street numbers were out of sync from one side of the road to another, and pointed us towards where the hotel was, unable to return down the street as it was one way. We grabbed our stuff and headed for the hotel. There is no big hotel sign out the front - but the street number (44) is clearly displayed. When you approach the door - you see the name of the hotel next to a buzzer. We were a little surprised to note that up stairs on the floor of this small hotel - there was a man sitting at a small desk which served as the reception area. The service was polite and efficient anc we managed to communicate with our broken italian and staff broken english just fine when we needed to. The room was small, but clean and bright, with a modern and clean bathroom suite. The room for us was a place tp sleep while we made the most of the sights of Rome most days... but its not the sort of room you would want to spend much more time in than that, as its not big enough for this. This hotel is better than a hostel (has its own bathroom) but probably closer to the size/style of a hostel. There is a safe in the room which we liked to see, and hanging space for clothes but no shelf to place our things on, which would have been useful. The breakfast was fine - croissants, toast, juice, coffee & biscuits - brought to the room - but we only had it one of the mornings as we were heading out and about early most mornings. The LCD Tv in the room was a nice touch at night as we got ready for bed - with many channels to choose from (All in Italian of course). I would recommend this hotel to stay in for people just needing a bed for the night while they go out and see the sights of thi amazing city during the day. We can also recommend the kebab shop on the corner for a late night snack, too....", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Piccola Locanda Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d801472-Reviews-La_Piccola_Locanda_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Bixio 44</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "801472", "ImgURL": ""}}
