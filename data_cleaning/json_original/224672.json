The Lakeview Inn is the closest to the junction and perhaps the newest on the strip. The inn is clean and modern. Our room, 129 was on the main floor and quite austere. It had two queen beds, a washroom, and an old fashioned TV (remember picture tubes?). There was a small table and two chairs and a small hutch for clothing that also held the TV. The coffee maker only came with one package of coffee but the bathroom was nicely equipped with lots of towels, shampoo, conditioner and hand soap. The beds were moderately firm and the pillows soft and inviting. I can't imagine who would find this hotel location convenient. The hotel is located in the former city of Scarborough, quite some distance from the attractions of downtown. We were staying one night as our nearby house was under renovation. People driving into Toronto from the east cannot access the hotel directly as there is a boulevard and no left turn into the parking lot. http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=toronto+lakeside+days+inn&hl=en&ll=43.702096,-79.253813&spn=0.741628,1.234589&sll=43.615085,-79.382576&sspn=0.04791,0.077162&vpsrc=6&hq=lakeside+days+inn&hnear=Toronto,+Toronto+Division,+Ontario&t=h&fll=43.683764,-79.222412&fspn=0.741849,1.234589&z=10&layer=c&cbll=43.702096,-79.253813&panoid=NDtx-Js70g-P__BLoCVeLw&cbp=12,192.52,,0,16.43 There is a bus stop 60 metres east of the hotel. The only bus that will take you directly to the subway doesn't stop at that stop during rush hours. The 12 km ride to northeast Scarborough took 40 minutes with one transfer. I would guess about the same time to downtown. That said, the parking is free and that along with the free breakfast make it quite attractive. BTW: No bedbugs were seen or felt.

The water in the reservoir had slimy oil-slick surface... I took the whole thing down to the front counter, they were very quick to replace it with a brand new machine, and even came up to the room and plugged it in.

The room hadn't been vacuumed since ?... we found a candy on the floor that any normal half-attempt at cleaning the floors would have picked up. 5. NONE OF THE WINDOWS OPEN - ANYWHERE. Sorry..was I yelling? NONE OF THE WINDOWS OPEN. IN ANY OF THE ROOMS. 6. You are not allowed to use the stairwells at either end of the hall - only the elevator, else an alarm sounds. I found that strange. Using the stairs would have been more convenient for me to get to my car.. 7. Tried to have a bath at one point. Great! -- no bathtub plug! Had to go downstairs for that as well, management stole one from an unoccupied room. Wonderful. Now that room doesn't have one 8. Lastly, what a pleasant surprise upon checkout to find they tried to \"up\" the price by an additional $20... when I complained and said I'd booked online at $121.44, they adjusted the bill down to $121, but only after a back-room consultation with other staff. Nice try guys! Oh, I guess one other thing.. why not tell guests the free-wireless password when they check in...

One lamp next to the bed didn't have a knob to turn it on with, and the knob on the other lamp just kept turning and turning after we finally got it on, therefore the only way to turn it off was by unscrewing the bulb. The white ceiling was a pale beige color, definitely time for a new paint job, and/or better ventilation in the rooms where smoking is allowed.

Continental breakfast included standard fare and there was plenty of free parking and free local newspapers. There was construction next door, but it was never loud and the area is still tidy. \"Lakeview\" however, is misleading as there was no view that I could find. All said, a very pleasant experience with a nice hotel.", "Date": "October 4, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNEVER stay at this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1686769", "Content": "My husband and I booked a \"smoking\" jacuzzi suite at this hotel because we wanted an affordable weekend away. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that there were no smoking rooms available, but that we could take a standard smoking room if we wanted. We showed our room confirmation printout to the front desk clerk, who proceeded to tell us that there was nothing he could do for us. We told him that we wanted to cancel our reservation because they were not willing to honour the reservation that we had made. We were abruptly told that if we chose to do that, we would be charged for the night anyway, regardless of the error that was made. We asked to speak to a manager and of course, the manager was unavailable. The clerk told us to call the Days Inn Customer Service Line, which we proceeded to do. The agent we spoke with was rude and did not even aplogize for the error. She simply told us that there was nothing she was willing to do. We decided to take the room anyway, but when we arrived there, it did not look anything like the picture on the Days Inn website. So, we went back to the front desk to speak with the clerk. Again, he told us that we could not cancel the reservation without a charge. He ended up moving us to a standard room, which although decent enough, was not what we had booked. To top it all off, we were woken up on Sunday morning by loud televisions both beside us and above us. Oh, and the name \"Lakeview\" is quite misleading. We were on the top floor and the view of the lake was minimal and required looking over several sketchy houses that backed onto the hotel. Overall, this was a horrible experience. If we had known that we were going to be stuck with a standard room, we would have booked a hotel downtown. We do not recommend this hotel to anyone!", "Date": "March 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, ohio", "Title": "\u201cwhen money is tight\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1532554", "Content": "clean and good breakfast at the East/lakeview.
