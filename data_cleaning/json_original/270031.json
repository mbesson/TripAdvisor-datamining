The hotel is absolutely beautiful - every inch of it is designed meticulously, you can tell that so much thought went into the planning of every corner and niche. Our room was very comfortable and lovely to come back to after every excursion in the city - one of the room's highlights is the lavish set of over 20 soaps and lotions set-up smartly in numbered long tubes that you can pick and choose from with the help of a \"soap menu\" that explains what each soap/lotion is. It was just a small detail of the room, but one that made us feel pampered and taken care of. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful beyond words - all of the concierge staff were extremely helpful in recommending tourist attratctions and making reservations for us, and always with a smile. Lastly (but no less important): the hotel's location is fantastic - we walked EVERYWHERE throughout the entire city. It's about a 2 minute walk to Barberini Square (where the metro is, if/when needed), a 7 min. walk to the Spanish steps, and everything else is walking distance as well with varying times.

The staff were very pleasant on arrival but took a long time to locate my booking. When we eventually got to our room I walked in to find the curtain hanging off the rail, the bathroom door hanging off and the air con sounded like it was ready to explode, not to mention the musky smell. I called reception to complain and Gemma arranged for us to move rooms. To my amazement, when I walked in to my second room the first thing i noticed was that the curtain was again falling off the rail, the shower door was again loose, there were used toiletries in the shower which also had dirty tiles. It also only worked as a trickle, not powerful enough to clean my shoes, let alone shower in. When called reception again I noticed a huge amount of dead bugs within the main lampshade. I called Gemma again who upgraded us to a suite. We checked in to our suite and was once again appauled to find another curtain hanging loose off the rail. The walls were stained near the bathroom and there was also a stain on the floor on the entry to the bathroom. Once I entered the bathroom I looked into the bath, only to find a huge mark in the bath from where it had previously been repaired. I was also upset to notice that the chair arm was broken. There was also a rip in the pillow case. I telephoned Gemma at reception to tell her of this and she said that she would speak to the manager and get back to me. We never heard back from her. We had had such a long day travelling that we could not cope with switching rooms for a 3rd time (as my wife is pregnant) so we simply decided to stay in the room. On our second night we returned from dinner early and decided to watch a movie. I tried to use the \u2018pay tv\u2019 service but it did not work. I phoned reception and they told me that the engineer had gone home and would fix it tomorrow. When I returned the next evening I asked at reception if anybody had repaired our television and I was informed that the engineer had done all the jobs he had been asked to complete so my tv should now work. Once again I tried to use the pay tv service only to find it was still not working. I called reception and was told again that the engineer had gone home but somebody would call me back. 10 minutes later I received a phone call advising me that nobody in the hotel had pay tv, however, this had still ruined our second evening. I have to admit that this is not the standard I expect from a 5 star hotel, in fact, I have stayed in 3 star hotels with better standards. I had very much looked forward to my visit to Rome and the Boscolo Aleph, but I left very very disappointed with the hotel and feel that the claims to be a 5 star hotel were nothing misleading lies. I emailed the hotel on 15th June 2011 to complain about all of these but heard nothing back. I called about the lack of reply to my email and was told that someone would reply.

With that said, we were very pleased with our room. The bed was comfortable, it was spacious enough, the bathroom was a good size. I like how they give you tubes of body wash, shampoo, conditioner and mouth wash to choose from. You get slippers and robes, dressers, and closet space. The only \"bad\" thing was the small tube TV. I was suprised they didn't have flat screens but honestly we never used the TV so it didn't matter. Another issue was was the internet. They said it is $10 Euro for 30 minutes of wifi. Um no thanks!! Also the breakfast buffet was $20 Euro. We showed up at 10 am. There were no eggs and barely any potatoes, sausage and bacon left. They only replenished the eggs. It was by far the most disgustings eggs I have ever tasted. The meat was cold so that tasted bad, too. This is seriously the worst breakfast I have ever had at any hotel! Moving on, the concierge is pretty helpful. I think it was Gemma that recommended a few good restaurants. When we checked out, the hotel ended up refunding breakfast and wanted to offer us a free one, which is good customer service on their part. I really love the location of this hotel. It is down the street from Via Veneto and the the taxi stand is literally a block or so away at Barberini.

When my husband and i arrived to check in, the man on the desk proceeded to answer a phone call and left us standing there while we were ignored. Once they were ready to deal with us, there was no \"welcome\" comment, merely \"passports\" was barked at us and a room key given to us. We were left to our own devices to get the luggage to our room, and as soon as i stepped out of the elevator, i know i would be disappointed with the room. The lobby area is quite trendy/modern, and the lift has nice black and white pictures, but the corridors on our level (1) had a nasty blue carpet, no decoration and random housekeeping items left hanging around - a vaccum cleaner here, some bed linen there. Our room was very 90s with nasty fake wood panelling. I wouldn't have minded so much about the decor as i appreciate some things are subjective, but there were many things broken - TV didn't work, air con made a loud noise, (so much so we had to turn it off to sleep), no bottled water, no iron, tiles missing on the bathroom floor, broken table in the bathroom. After paying a HUGE sum for two nights stay, it just seemed a bit insulting. (And breakfast wasn't included in our outrageously expensive rate). The problems with our room wouldn't have been so bad if service had been good - but it wasn't. We asked the reception to make a dinner reservation for us, which they never managed to do. Even after reminding them THREE times to call, they never managed to call the restaurant so we ended up ringing ourselves. We didn't eat at the hotel, so i can't comment on the food. We went up to the roof bar but there was a private party on and so i cannot comment on that either. All in all, this place is a bit confused. On one hand you have a building in a great area, with an impressive looking lobby/bar, but rooms that are dated and need a refurb. Staff could do with a bit more customer relations training.

After booking I read some of the reviews on here and felt slightly apprehensive, and I'm sad to report that they are pretty accurate. I'm sure when this hotel opened in 2003 it was the epitome of design cool and luxury, but unfortunately you can tell that it opened in 2003 and that it's edge has worn off (literally) and hasn't been refreshed. The room we booked was small, smelt damp, tatty (damaged blinds, scratched walls, shower door hanging off) and the shower 'half worked'. On day 2 the toilet broke and wouldn't flush so we were moved rooms. While it was better, it still felt old with dirty walls, cracked cupboards and worn carpet. The pool still wasn't working (which according to here has been for the last few months or so) and the 'gym' consisted of one cycling machine and some weight machines. Customer service was pretty non-existent with no-one answering the phones on reception until you'd rung several times. It took 2 hours for someone to respond when we complained our toilet wasn't working and our request for an iron never even materialised despite asking twice. Yes the reception looks 5 star, the prices are 5 star and the location is great, but overall this hotel is currently pushing 3 star at best. They clearly are refurbing as there was a lot of painting etc going on while we were there but there is a long way to go to '5 star'. Definately not worth a deal let alone full price, with hindsight I wish we'd booked a 3 or 4 star as it would have been a much better experience.

The first time was in 2009, and the second a couple of weeks ago, in March 2011. I had truly LOVED this place the first time. I loved the crazy modern red d\u00e9cor in the lobby, the classic Italian film stills lining the elevators, the gorgeous rooftop bar, and above all the overall original outlandish design for every detail - as my husband described it: \u201cIf Cavalli and Versace had a pissing contest, this would be the result\u201d. I really liked our room, which was spacious, with extremely high ceilings and a lovely settee at the bed\u2019s feet; we had been given one of the only 3 or 4 rooms with a huge terrace, with a wooden table, stylish outdoor canvas chairs, and loungers - we really enjoyed our evening aperitifs and morning breakfast out there. However, what really made a difference compared to other hotels was the spa \u2013 after a long day of sightseeing, there is nothing more regenerating than chilling out in their tranquil, serene, elegant turquoise Roman bath. That was the main reason we decided to go back to that hotel for our second visit to Rome. Well, were we ever disappointed! It turns out that the Roman bath is now closed, and they can\u2019t even say when it will reopen (some issue with some pump spare part they can\u2019t locate). So, the spa was virtually useless. They do have a sauna and steam bath, but those are pretty standard, similar to those you find in any gym - not even worth the time. Even though we paid for a deluxe room, the balcony rooms were not available. The room we got was nice and spacious, but not especially well decorated \u2013 rather on the plain side. There was nothing particularly original, elegant or stylish about it. The rooftop bar, which boasts a gorgeous view over Rome roofs, was closed because it was still considered \u201cwinter\u201d, even though the temperature was in the 70s.

The first two days we got freshly squeezed orange juice which was nice and the next two orange from concentrate. Nothing looked desirable to eat so I decided to do what the italians do and have coffee and pastries. I couldn't believe it when the pastries were not even fresh tasting. The hotel food menu is very expensive so because the breakfast and service was so bad we didn't even consider eating in the hotel. Watch out for being ripped off by cafe/bar owners. Always ask how much for everything before you sit down and if you do sit down you may be charged for that too. The wine is more expensive than at home in fact all food and drink is more expensive.

We wanted luxury, but didn't want to spend everything we had on hotel rooms. I found a really good deal for this hotel and was a little nervous that it all seemed too good to be true. We arrive early in the morning on June 22nd and were immediately impressed by the gorgeous lobby and hints of a Heaven/Hell theme in the decor. It was modern, trendy and very hip. Probably too hip for us, but they were so nice to us regardless. As we were checking in, the hotel clerk said he wanted to upgrade our room. I thanked him and told him it was our honeymoon so that was a wonderful surprise. Upon hearing this, he appeared to do something else on the computer and asked if we would be willing to wait one hour for a maid to clean the room he wanted to give us. It was hours before the regular check-in time so waiting an hour was no problem for us, especially for the upgrades. We walked down the street to the Spanish Steps (which are only a couple blocks from the hotel) and then grabbed coffee at a cafe. When we returned they took us to our room -- a beautiful, modern, funky room with a complimentary bottle of champagne for us. Best of all, the room had its very own ROOFTOP TERRACE. Not a balcony, but rather an entire terrace with ivy-covered walls, chaise lounge chairs, little tables and chairs for drinks, etc... and a hot tub that was not being used. We assumed this was a public area, but then we realize there was only one other room that had access to it -- the penthouse suite. During our entire trip we never saw anyone else on the terrace and we drank coffee every morning on it. Never in a million years would I have thought we would have our very own rooftop terrace in Rome. If you stay here, try to book a room on the SIXTH FLOOR to get access to the terrace. Throughout our stay, the front desk staff was incredibly kind and helpful to us. The hotel staff helped us arrange tours, recommended a PHENOMENAL restaurant with some of the best lobster I've ever had, and catered to any request we had. The location was ideal for us. We were up the street from the Triton fountain and within walking distance of many attraction, including the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain, etc... The metro station was one block away and we were able to get everywhere on it. I've stayed at some wonderful hotels and this one will always be very special to me. I recommend it to anyone. My only minor negative comment and I'll agree with other posters on this: The restaurant/room service/bar is very pricey. Go down the street if you don't want to spend everything on a so-so meal.

The first thing we were told was that the spa was closed on Saturday (our only full day in Rome) so my wife was unable to have any treatments, which was one of the factors i took into account when booking. Nevertheless, we entered the lift and went up to the correct floor, but then appeared to get out into the travel lodge corridor, not the hotel with the great entrance lobby we had just been in. Very odd. On entering our room, it was very nice, but with nowhere to put our luggage, this made things awkward to say the least.

The Hotel - The hotel was clean, updated, modern, with a touch of edgy decorating scheme. The staff was friendly and helpful - when we decided to extend our stay there, the staff even helped us get an extension to our deal. They also sent a bottle of champagne our first night (I think it was because we mentioned that it was our anniversary). Breakfast was OK - they had the same items everyday but there were a fair amount of warm and cold selections. It's nice that hot drinks were included in the breakfast, they had very good coffee. The spa facilities was ok, we only used the spa once. The whirlpool was not kept as well as it could have and the water was just luke warm but they do have some work out equipments. The Room - We got upgraded to a Deluxe room as part of our deal -t we had more than enough space, especially for a European hotel. The bed was large and comfortable. The room was also clean, updated, and had modern decors. The bathroom was clean and updated (part of the mirror by the sink was even heated so that it does not fog up after shower). The bathtub was skinnier than normal but not a big deal. The TV channel selection was also limited, but again not a big deal. Location - The hotel was tucked away in a smaller street in the Via Veneto area but it was very convenient. There are a few buses that stop in front of the hotel that went to the major sights. The Barberini piazza is at the end of the block where many more bus lines stop and there is a metro stop as well. If you plan on taking public transportation, this hotel seems to be a lot more convenient than some of the hotels further up Via Veneto.

Cheap wooden wardrobes and headboards look completely out of place. Our room has two drawers in the wardrobe that were broken and could not be used while the shower had loose tiles. The rooms however were not the biggest problem we had during our stay. Breakfast (which at least was included in our rate of c.\u20ac250 per night) is not worth paying for and I would recommend getting a rate without it included. On both mornings it was cold (scrambled eggs, bacon etc) and soggy. The bread was stale and the toaster didn't work.

I got a great rate on the room, which was the only reason I chose it frankly. The hotel staff were very hot/cold. A few of them were very attentive and friendly. Just as many were cold and seemed to stare you down as you entered and left the building. There were a few times when I felt very unwelcome simply leaving to go out on the town. The desk seemed always busy and if you needed something, it seemed you were getting in their way. One member in particular was very friendly and helpful but I have to admit, I didn't ask for anything or need anything in particular during my stay. One thing I will mention is that bath tubs in rome seem rare and this one had jacuzzi jets, which was great after days upon days of walking around rome.

I wish I had a photo of the spa ... its \"pool\" (for wading, not swimming) is a lush maze of sleek, sparkly pools and waterfalls linked together through cool passageways. On our first visit our room was too tiny - the website says 25 square meters, and we couldn't quite visualize what that was like. Turns out that the room was just big enough for our queen-size bed and a couple of feet of free space on each side, and the 25 square meters must include the bathroom and closet. The furniture is built in, so the space is efficiently used ... but it was tight. On our second visit we sprang for a slightly larger room (35 square meters), and that made all the difference. One disturbing thing: We came back to our room one day during our second stay at the hotel, and the room safe wouldn't open. We called the front desk; they sent up someone who manually opened the safe and re-set the combination. I later found that about US $200 had been stolen from the passport wallet I'd locked in the safe - so, our conclusion is that someone who has the key needed to manually open and re-set the safe combinations must have broken in, stolen the money, and re-set the combination (which explains why we were unable to ope the safe with the combination we'd created). The hotel did nothing about it - didn't even respond to the letter I sent when back in the US. Of course, we know about the disclaimers on room safes - 'you agree that you're leaving stuff here at your own risk, etc.' - so had no recourse. I now lock my stuff in my suitcase rather than using room safes; it feels more like a lesson about the false safety of room safes than about this particular hotel.

The hotel has a great location near Place Barberini and the Via Venetto. The hotel is 4-years old and located in what use to be a bank. Style...style...style....this hotel is stylish, in a very contemporary way. It looks like it came out of one of those HGTV design shows. It was very nice. We had reserved 2 rooms (at the lowest rate available); one of our rooms was upgraded, and this room was very large. It included two single beds, a chaise lounge, plenty of storage, and a very large bathroom. Our second room was smaller, but it still had a king bed, a reasonable amount of storage, and a nice size bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and the linens, robes, and towels were high quality. The rooms were quiet, but the views were nonexistent--a view of an alley. Service was good from everyone, although we could tell we were in Rome (and not Switzerland) by the fact that the fitness center opened more than 1 hour late one day (with no explanation) and we had trouble finding a waitress in the empty restaurant one morning, even though the restaurant had opened an hour earlier (we ended up going to the front desk who found someone who could help us in the restaurant). Our biggest complaint was that the air conditioner in one of our rooms could not cool the room enough. It seemed to work fine in our 2nd room. While the hotel sent someone to look into the problem, we never seemed to be able to cool the room down enough. Since I like the room cool (mid 60's) while I sleep, I probably would not stay here again. The fitness center and spa was surprisingly good for a hotel in Rome. There was a beautiful Roman bath, two treadmills, a few bikes, a rower, and some weight equipment. There was also a beautiful relaxation room (inside the former bank vault). There were a number of great sidewalk restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, and even a Hard Rock Cafe 5 minutes from the hotel in case you crave a burger or a huge American salad. While sitting in the lobby, I overhead a member of the Boscolo family talking about their hotel chain and their desire to provide a 5-star experience in their properties. If it weren't for the HVAC problems, I would rate this as a 4+ (for our larger room) and a 4-star (for our smaller room).

The hotel has a stunning lobby (which probably explained the design award), but the rest of the hotel is not as design as one could expect. The service is uneven: some people were very friendly; other unhelpful and aggressive. We booked a deluxe room and what was our surprise when we were showed our first room: on the second floor with almost no natural light; overseeing a small unattractive backyard. In the room the ceiling lamp was broken so you could see all the bulbs. Another lamp on the wall had been badly repaired. The bathroom was more like the one you would find in a hospital; not in a design hotel. On top of this we had twin beds while we had asked for a single bed. After we complained, we were shown a number of other rooms that were not really better. After dealing with unfriendly or unmotivated front desk staff we finally complained directly to the Boscolo reservation centre and we were then proposed to get one of the few rooms with a very large terrace (roughly 40 sqm) at the same conditions as our original booking. Our last room was definitely better than the first one but overall our experience in the hotel was not very good: some of the staff was taking drinks from our minibar during our absence; leaving empty bottles in the room.

Bed was so comfortable and fresh sheets were used everyday. The housekeeper checked every afternoon that our room was satisfactory and asked if we needed anything. ( I read a review in which someone mentioned that the staff were rude - I disagree! They were a friendly bunch of young italians and nothing was too much trouble). The hotel benefits from being off a main street so a quiet night is guaranteed. Thick roman blinds mean that the room is dark - perfect when recovering from too much vino. Spa was a welcome retreat to rest tired legs. Again, more blue glass and soothing lighting. There is no swimming pool but large thermal baths and 'bubble corridor' with water jets to relax in. Sauna and steamroom and a great mini gym if you like that sort of thing! Also a chill out zone in the room that was used as the bank safe in days gone by. Didn't eat in the hotel - concierge gave us some great restaurant ideas (acqui negra is a funky and lively restaurant worth a look).

Mind you we paid $50,000+ in hotel rooms and incidental for less than a week to stay at the Aleph with a whole film crew.

While we were there, the plumbing broke and there was the smell of fecal matter throughout the hotel. When new guests would arrive a strange look would overcome them and you could overhear their attempt to figure out the origin of this stench. This problem lasted the ENTIRE week we were there. The power went out in one of our production coordinators rooms and the hotel didn\u2019t offer to help him move all of his kits and luggage in the dark. The staff was completely unapologetic to the smell and over \u00bd of the crew was bitten by mosquitoes (which is disgusting amidst a sewage problem). Meanwhile, the director had her 2 year son in a room that was completely ruined with sewage smell. We received absolutely now compensation, not even a verbal apology. The staff literally snuffed their noses at us and ignored anyone who complained (even non-film crew guests). The wireless internet would not work in the conference room which was literally right next to the lobby (where it worked), unless we paid an outrageous fee of $20 hour. Please. Also, the rooftop restaurant would have been nice, except they decided to close early sporadically throughout the week. The only other option was room service, such as a club sandwich (no sides, no fries, nada) for $40 US. Ridiculous. I would NEVER stay here again. It\u2019s one thing when a hotel has some issues out of their control, but when they have no remorse, compensation or even a \u201csorry\u201d, it is completely unacceptable.

The staff were very attentive and friendly. We liked the location of the hotel. It is about a seven minute walk to the Spanish steps and main shopping area. We walked to the attractions a little further away too such as the colleseum (about 35 mins) as there is so much to see on the way and lots of cafes to stop off in. The downstairs spa was very relaxing and we actually had the facilities to ourselves each time we went as the hotel was so quiet. We were very pleased with our choice of hotel and would recommend it to others.", "Date": "September 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire, England", "Title": "\u201cPromised much but was actually average\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3812434", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in May 2005, having been somewhat swayed by the pictures on the hotel's website.

I had also arranged a 2pm check out which was all arranged. The room on the 2nd floor was appointed exactly as per the website. The only thing missing was the bath robes, which were brought up within 5 minutes of me asking. All of the fittings worked and were in excellent condition.

All of the staff I encountered at this hotel always had a smile and were really helpful. I honestly can\u2019t understand how anyone could have a problem with them. I would say that yes this hotel is expensive for sundries. A coke from the minbar costs 5 euros and a beer on the roof terrace costs 12 euros. Let\u2019s face it you don\u2019t have to buy them, and there a plenty of shops around this hotel to stock up, the via Veneto is about 1 minute walk. The hard rock caf\u00e9 is also about 1 minute away if you must have American/English fare. Barberini tube is 30 seconds away which gives access to all of the main sites although they are all perfectly walkable from the hotel.

My husband and I stayed there for three days in March for our first anniversary. I had done quite a bit of research and had narrowed down my choices to the Aleph and the Capo d'Africa. We were staying at Le Sirenuse in Positano directly after, so I wanted to find a very nice, but not extravagant hotel for Rome. I was very happy with Aleph and especially after visiting Rome, very happy we didn't choose the Capo d'Africa as it was quite out of the way being down by the Colesseum. I liked the decor, but I like eclectic places. And I found the service to be nice.....I wouldn't say they went completely out of their way. But, they were very friendly and did exactly what I asked. I corresponded with the concierge several times before arriving to set up dinner reservations and all was done as I asked. I was very excited with our room. I will say that I not only called the 800 Boscolo number to book, but also followed up with several e-mails to both the concierge and front desk to tell them it was an anniversary visit and very special. We paid for a regular room but received a room on the top floor with its own terrace. Plus, they gave us a bottle of complementary wine. All of this I found very fitting for their rating. I believe that it did have something to do with the fact that I had requested an outdoor area when making the reservation and did follow up several times. I did not use the spa, but I did go down to visit it - I did not find them to be snotty as other reviewers have. Also, I was aware the roof top terrace was closed during our stay because it was still spring. So, I was not surprised by that. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. I do think we received one of their nicer rooms and that may have had everything to do with my impression. But, I did enjoy my stay and would recommend this hotel to a friend. I will say that if you do have the means though, my husband and I stopped into the Hotel de Russie during one of our days and that hotel blew me away. Of course, the prices were double what I paid at the Aleph and is another star higher.

This is perfectly illustrated by the fact that the books in the library are not real, they are holograms!!!! very trendy I am sure but not much use if you want to read a book. Papers were only Italian, and the internet is not free of use, to connect your laptop in your own room costs 50 cents per minute of internet time. TV is very limited in English, only Bloomberg, CNN and Italian MTV (amusing to watch the Osbourn's dubbed in Italian!!!!) Not that you go to Rome to watch the box, but quite nice to have the choice after a long day walking around. They said the BBC was not yet available even though it is listed in the hotel brochure. There were about 4 english speaking movies to choose from the in-house TV menue at a cost of 14 euros for the first choice and 7 thereafter. The roof terrace was closed, a big pity as it was the main reason for choosing the hotel. Funny that they have an area of the web site for \"news\" and don't list it. Maybe they should title it as \"good news only\" The spa was a bit of a joke really, the water in the pool area which is designed to relax in, not swim in, was the temperature suitable for swimming in, not relaxing in. It was VERY COLD (in my view). The sauna and steam room were OK. The location of the hotel was OK. I think we would stay near piazza Navona next time, this is a perfect location access to many other areas on foot. Staff were good, very polite and attentive when asked for something. Like the other review, I asked for an iron, but was told I could not have one. Maybe European law because I have been refused before in hotels. Or maybe it is just another way of making more money out of you as they of course have a laundry service. The mini bar provided the suspicion that is was designed to maximise short term profitability, as it was one of those fridges that was sensitive to any movement within, so that if you removed a bottle of water it was automatically charged to the bill. We managed to squeeze a couple of small bottles in. It may sound tight, but about 4 euros for a small bottle of water or can of coke is just a rip off. These small things made one feel as thought the hotel is really best suited for business travellers, who expense every thing. Actually there was constant Bloomberg TV in the lift. As an investment manager it was a bit unrelaxing to use the lift, as being on holiday you don't really want to know what the NASDAQ is doing!
