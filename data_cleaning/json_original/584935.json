We were greated with a warm welcome and where then shown to our room which was located a few meters away from the main hotel. We were on the top floor and there was no lift but my husband and I didn't mind that. The room wasn't large but was Charming and quite rustic we were very very pleased with what we got for our money :) breakfast is served in the other part of the hotel and we were happy with what was on offer and it was kept topped up right up until 10.30am! The staff were helpful and polite. The location of the hotel is great with lots of reasonably priced restaurants and shops near by. You are also close enough to the main sights and transport.

We thought it was excellent!\u201d", "Author": "FenellaHellyer", "ReviewID": "UR121417927", "Content": "I booked this hotel without looking at the reviews on here and for a while I was convinced we had wasted our money on what would transpire to be a trip blighted by a poor hotel. Thankfully, we arrived to find an excellent hotel and impeccable service from lovely, polite staff, who all spoke English and who went out of their way to make out stay as enjoyable as possible. They even said to us at the end of our stay that we did not have to pay for the sparkling wine we had taken from the mini bar! I don't really see how anyone can complain about that! Our room was small but clean and beautifully decorated, the bathroom was a spacious marble clad affair and outside of our room the decor told a far more regal story than the meagre \u00c2\u00a3150 each we paid for a three night stay. That price was including return flights from London too so how the hotel made any money out of us I do not know. Breakfast was a lovely start to the day and was served for far longer than I have ever encountered in hotels, I believe it was from 0730 to 1030, giving us plenty of time for a little lie in followed by delicious coffee and gorgeous continental pastries. There was a wide selection for breakfast, all the usual continental breakfast stuff, cheeses, sliced meats, fresh breads, fresh fruit, cereal and what have you but the croissants stuffed with apricot preserve were enough to keep me on a sugar high until lunch and delicious enough to put a smile on my face. Plus our room was cleaned every day, the hotel offers breakfast in bed (which we declined as the dining room at the sister hotel in which it was served was a particularly pretty place to sit) a very affordable room service, a laundry and dry cleaning service and a safe at no extra charge plus a well stocked mini bar. The only thing that was issing was a view from the window, but then they are practically giving the rooms away, and we were only in the room in the morning and evening so I'm not going to gripe about that. All in all the Ca Priuli made for an excellent, affordable base from which to explore this beautiful city. I can't comment on anyone who said it was too hot and needed air conditioning because we visited in November, however the reason why I'm giving it four stars and not five is because the central heating was on rather high making for somewhat airless nights. As for the complaint about the TV only having 6 channels, well, for goodness sake nobody goes to Venice to watch TV! I don't think we even switched ours on, we found a concerto at La Fenice and all the city's beautiful sights to be far more entertaining than the idiot box. Six channels indeed, if they are going to alter that they should ditch the TVs to extend the selection of gorgeous Prosecco in the mini bar! If you have paid enormous amounts for this hotel through a travel agent and feel you have been over charged then take it up with the travel agent or look for a better deal, this hotel and it's staff are wonderful. Certainly not one to be missed!", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTerrible!!!

It was my first time in Venice and for what we paid for our crummy postage stamp of a room, we could have stayed at the Gritti Palace or the Danieli. The staff was rude and unhelpful to Americans. It was hot when we arrived and we were given a dingy room with NO AIR CONDITIONING. When we called the front desk to inquire as to what was wrong with the air conditioning, we were told that the air \"was down in the entire hotel but our call was the first complaint they had had\"...really? Being an air conditioning contractor's daughter I immediately noticed that our room had no air conditioning unit and when I brought that \"small\" detail to the attention of the front desk, they miraculously found another equally dingy room with air. We paid a lot of money for our hotel and are convinced that we did NOT get the room we paid for. Breakfast was mediocre with the breakfast room being small and crowded. The location was nice as it was in a very interesting neighborhood with good restaurants and shops. But we were having such a wonderful time in Venice that we decided not to make a big deal out of our closet-sized room that cost a fortune. Going back to Venice but NEVER staying there.

The staff delightful, the accommodations charming and the breakfast was the best we had on our trip (the coffee was also the best).

The hotel has a computer in the hall near the reception counter that is open to the internet for email and Skyping. The location is around 100 yards from St. Mark's Square, just outside of the tourist area, where you can find local shops selling food goods and nice keepsakes rather than the junk found near the tourist center.

I had been to Venice before, so I somewhat knew what to expect. I did NOT want to stay near St. Mark's square - way too crowded. Instead, I was looking for something well located to many of the major sites yet tucked away a little in a quiet place that would be nice to return home to after a busy day of sightseeing. Ca' Priuli was just the place. It is very close to St. Mark's square and the Rialto bridge - just a short walk, but it was also a great starting point to investigate some of the smaller quieter spots in Venice - these are truly the best! The hotel was easy to reach from the airport. We took a water taxi to a spot right around the corner from the hotel - it couldn't have been easier. The taxi cost 120 euros for 5 people and took about 25 minutes. This was money well spent. The hotel itself is very nice. It's an older and very charming property. Ca Priuli is just a few doors down from the main hotel. We had to walk to the main building for breakfast, but this wasn't bad. It's located on a canal so the walk is pretty. The breakfast was lovely - ham, salami, cheeses, pastries, juices, coffee, tea, fruit etc - very nice. The only negative for us was that there was not a working elevator in the building we stayed in so we had to walk up and down a few flight of stairs (not with our bags, the porter will take care of that). I felt this hotel had tremendous value compared to some of the other hotels in Venice. Also, I should mention that the people at the front desk were very helpful when it came to reservations, information etc. I would highly recommend the hotel and will plan on staying there again when in Venice.", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cAncient Property, Hard to Locate\u201d", "Author": "travelchicusa", "ReviewID": "UR38072950", "Content": "Definitely get perfect directions to this hotel before arrival; we had them and still got lost because there are no signs indicating the hotel's name aside from one on a door facing a corridor not visible from the street. The staff is friendly and the breakfast was good but the hotel is very old, almost scary. If it were completely renovated, maybe I'd stay here again but not otherwise. Given how difficult Venice is to navigate (you must reach each port by boat taxi or public water transportation), and the number of bridges you must cross, all of which are stairs without ramps, at least in San Marco, I'd definitely stay near the station and on the same side of the station so I wouldn't have to access my hotel by boat. Then you can simply visit all the sites within Venice by boat taxi without lugging your bags around.

Only 5 - 10 minutes walk to St Mark's Square, and would therefore recommend it. DIRECTIONS TO HOTEL: On arrival in Venice, these are the directions from Piazzale Roma. Get Vaporreto (water bus) No. 1, 52 or 82 - ( traveling to the left in the direction of Lido) - you want to get off at San Zaccaria. Cost: E6 for a single ticket - which you can buy and validate (in the yellow machine) at a ticket office nearby. (Otherwise, you can buy a ticket on the boat, just tell them as soon as you get on that you need to buy a ticket) When you get off, look for the Monument, and near to that , go through the small alleyway (see photo 1) marked Portico S. Zaccaria. Walk through here and it will open up into a square, turn left at the far end, and then take the first right (you will walk past a couple of Restaurants on your left). Follow this round until it bears right, with a small canal on your left. Cross the second bridge (see photo 2) - marked Ponte Del Diavolo, and the door to the Hotel Main Reception is immediately on your left. HOTEL: Extremely clean, friendly staff, lovely buffet breakfast, very warm (considering it was December), rooms nicely furnished and decorated (see photo 3). Reasonably priced. In the main building, on the first floor, there is a nice lounge area, where you can have your own drinks in the evening until 9.30pm.

We were booked through Euro Connections/ our travel agent. 1. Great location but might be VERY difficult to find on own but we had help of a private transfer. Would recommend the transfers in Venice. 2. Do not be mislead by pictures on internet! Yes, most of the rooms are beautiful! However, upon arrival we got put in the ATTIC! The room was up 3 flights on lift--great as it was very hot and humid. We then walked 16 steps up to an attic room. The room had a small \"parlor\" with a window over our heads and a fireplace. The bedroom was entered through an opening shaped in a triagle which was 5 feet on one side and and about 5'8\" on the otherside. The ceiling was \"beamed and low\". Immediately called to ask for another room and was told none available until next day. (They did come to fix air conditioning) I am 5'4\" and I had to lean the the middle to get near the bed. Only a sky light (too hot) and could not find a smoke detector. Had to sleep with the bathroom light on because of danger of hiting head getting up and out of room, low door and step down. Staff was indifferent and reluctant to give another room for the next 2 nights, but did. Limited response from manager (with cravat).....checked price and same as lovely room we got in other building, although it had no lift (as most don't). We took pictures to share with travel agent. Be VERY specific about placement of your room as they are in several buildings. Also, we are not super picky people, but we did not pay high fee to be put in an attic! Very disappointing.

The breakfast was delicious, very healthy , fruit, cereal, cold meats, pastrys. The staff where also very nice and helpful. The only quibble I would have is that the bed was two single beds joined together,other than that the hotel was perfect . The hotel is also very close to san marco square and St Marks Basilica is definitley worth a visit.
