The room was nice although the bed was alittle small. The breakfast was not great and was very greasy. drinks in the hotel were very over priced as a bottle of water and a glass of orange juice came to nearly 13 euros. i was also not aware that the hotel swimming pools would be closed and this was not mentioned anywhere when i booked the hotel however the spa does have a pool which will cost you 20 euros each to use. the spa facilites are same sex only which is a massive let down if you are traveling as a couple for a romantic get away. i was far from impressed with this hotel and i would not go back to stay.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Cajon, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautful and Quiet Getaway\u201d", "Author": "Connie525", "ReviewID": "UR128412679", "Content": "We were fortunate to be placed at this hotle by our cruise line.

Noise in the hotel was terrible, a dog was outside and spent 1 hour between 4 and 5 am barking and nothing seemed to be done The worst and biggest rip off is the parking, no other parking is available in the area so the hotel takes advantage and charges an eye watering 30 euros per night for the privilege.

Impressive lobby area and comfortable rooms. I slept well in a large bed and the bathroom was well appointed. Yet the carpet was threadbare in places and the wardrobe in the lobby area had been damaged by hitting the inner door (when this was closed the bedroom was very quiet). The hotel is surrounded by lovely gardens and we had our lunches served from a garden room with access to outside area which was great after being stuck in airless, windowless rooms for our meeting. You could also walk in the gardens which makes a change from the typical airport style business hotel. The gardens make this a good place to stay. The hotel has plenty of seminar rooms which are ideal for a business conference. As others have remarked it is a long way from the city centre so not a good choice for a tourist, there are bus stops nearby and the hotel has its own taxi rank. The Univeristy district is nearby and we wandered out and found a corner bar where our group had eight beers for about 15 euros, approx the cost of two beers in the hotel bar. The hotel is definitely priced for expense accounts! Spain is not well known for its vegetarian food but this is a hotel offering conferences to international audiences and we were asked in advance about dietary requirements. For our conference dinner the meal was tasty and imaginative but for the buffets we had the rest of the time the choice was terrible. The first evening the veggie food was grilled vegatables and bread. This was against a vast selection for meat eaters. The lunches improved slightly over this and at least most things were labelled. The service can best be described as prompt! The staff are constantly clearing plates away. There were a few staff who looked pleased to serve but most looked bored and too tied up with their own rules, they refused to let one of our number play the piano and told people off for sitting in the wrong place in the lobby.

Following that, we stayed for five nights at the Hotel Carlos Rey Juan, Barcelona, primarily for a conference that my husband was attending at the adjacent conference centre. We had never been to Barcelona before and I would love to return! I was not attending the conference, so I planned to do some swimming, shopping and sightseeing, I also planned to accompany my husband to a conference cocktail reception and a Presidents Dinner. We had booked a quiet, junior suite as we were aware that they were located on the higher floors and we required peace and space for my husband to sit and write a paper after his presentation at the conference. We were not disappointed. Our enormous junior suite rooms on the 15th floor, were positioned away from the hotel's atrium which was on the odd occasion, quite noisy, due to wedding celebrations and other activity, such as piano playing and large groups congregating together. In the room, there was so much natural light and we were facing the mountains. I loved the mattress, linen and cleanliness of the rooms, although the window furnishings were run down, and they didn't seem to have efficient block out lining. The air conditioning was good and nice and quiet. My husband enjoyed the connectivity to the free high speed internet.There was also a kettle in the suite that we really appreciated. (We had to order a jug of milk for the room as the powdered creamer was not what we liked, and on one occasion this cost us 5 Euros.) Some of the upholstered chairs in the room were uncomfortable and maybe had lost their spring and needed reupholstering. The tap water in the room was maybe heavily chlorinated, it was safe to drink but it tasted disgusting. In the end my husband bought some bottled water at the supermarket so we could enjoy it and also we used it in our coffees and teas. It was very hot weather, and we are also swimmers. We were anticipating many swims in their gorgeous garden pool. We only had two opportunities to do this, because unfortunately, we were to learn that often that area was closed to guests so that the staff could set up for weddings and other such functions, and on a couple of frustrating encounters, we were diverted to the then crowded fitness pool and we were somewhat inconvenienced and disappointed by this. The conference breakfast room was on the mezzanine level for the first couple of mornings, probably because of the wedding and other guests using the better rooms on the ground floor. Even though the food for buffet breakfast was amazing with a vast selection, I thought that the overall experience was diminished by the very ordinary surroundings and large round tables for about 12 people that were mostly empty by the time I was there. As we were time poor and there weren't any restaurants very close by to walk to, we ate in the hotel restaurant for dinner on two occasions - on the night of our arrival and the night before we left. We found the ambience in the hotel restaurant quite nice, the staff were attentive and the food and wine was pretty good and well priced. As we had come directly from Italy, we noticed that in Barcelona, the understanding of the English and the language was not as good as in our previous hotel. We went to the concierge in the late afternoon of the day of our arrival. Concierge didn't seem to understand that as we had been travelling all day (and that my husband had to get up at 7am the next day), all we wanted to was eat dinner at 6pm (not in our room) and then go to bed. The concierge could not direct us to one restaurant close by that was open until at least 8.00pm, we even knew that this was the norm for Spain, but with such a large hotel and guests coming in from all over the world, we were hoping that there was at least something close by! The next night I was sure the concierge had booked us into a restaurant close by, so we took an hours walk there only to find it closed. Thankfully, the helpful, friendly taxi driver found us wondering around and offered to take us elsewhere and we had a great meal at a place that he found for us. When I asked the concierge the next day about the closed restaurant, he knew nothing about that restaurant booking for us, only something about another restaurant booking we had made for another night, which we ended up having to cancel, which was also a difficult encounter. Aside from that, the concierge were good at recommending an all day bus tour, and providing details about catching the efficient Metro with maps provided and the station close by. In summary, the hotel position was perfect for its spaciousness, cleanliness and proximity to the conference centre and airport. The buffet breakfast food was amazing, and overall the staff were friendly and mostly helpful. Even though the metro was very nearby, if we were to visit Barcelona again as tourists only, I would personally prefer to stay more central so that other dining, shopping, and swimming options were available nearby.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bangalore", "Title": "\u201cWe loved and we'll be back\u201d", "Author": "rishikothari", "ReviewID": "UR114535505", "Content": "Rishi:Rishi Kothari \"Abundance everywhere\" Date:1st June 2011 We booked this hotel after checking the reveiws from Tripadvisor.Its an awesome property.

Possibly at the opening it was a 5* GL, but definetely not now. The hotel is located in a quite and nice area but quite far from everything. There was a queue at the reception desk, with only one receptionist attending the arriving guests. There were more staff in the back office, but it seemed that noone was bothered about the queue. For some reasons I have stayed in a 4* hotel in Barcelona the previous night, there was no queue and 2 receptionist. I understand that there might be a queue in any hotel, but on my opinion a 5*GL can not afford the luxury of having only one receptionist with a queue of guests. The room was spacious and comfortable. The furniture looks new. The mattress was quite hard for me, but this depends on the personal taste. I have asked for a non smoking room but the room I was given was smelling tobacco smoke. The design of the room is a bit strange in some details. There is a hall at the entrance to the room with the minibar and wardrobe. The entrance to the bathroom is from the entrance hall. The bathroom is big, well iluminated and spacious, exactly as 5*GL bathroom should be. The minibar is located in one of the wardrobes at the entrance meanwhile the safety box is located in the room, under the desk with the TV, where in any \"normal\" hotel the minibar would be. The entrance to the room from the entrance hall is separated by a door. The door to the room opens to the wrong side. Let me explain. The shelf for the luggage is located inside the room just behind the door. So everytime you want to take your clothes from your luggage to the wardrobe in the hall - you need to take your clothes out of your luggage first, then pass to the entrance hall, close the room door, then open the wardrobe and hang the clothes in. Repeat the operation depending on the quantity of clothes you have. After 4-5 \"tours\" I have left the remaining clothes in my luggage until next \"hanging session\". Can't say anything about the amenities of the hotel, but have seen people playing tennis, advertising in the elevators about spa, gym, massage, etc. The breakfast was just correct. For a 5*GL could be a lot better and with more choice. The bars are extremely expensive, I mean the minibar and lobby bar. One 0,33l bottle of Heineken in the lobby bar costs about 8 eur. You can check the minibar prices on the photo attached. The prices are without VAT, actually at 18%. If you want to have a quite stay and use the amenities this hotel might be for you. If you want to visit Barcelona as a tourist, there are better and less expensive options available in the city without giving up the quality. I would rank the hotel like this: 5*GL for the overall space and bathroom, 4-5* for the room, 3* for the reception, service and staff. The bar and minibar prices are out of the market.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlingame, California", "Title": "\u201cSkip this one\u201d", "Author": "BriefBoy", "ReviewID": "UR104995380", "Content": "They can't keep the water and electricity on, and they don't care.

At this time of the year there is one a la carte restaurant with a limited menu, a bar (which doesn't serve pints) and a central area which shares it's food menu with the bar. I found the food to be basic and over priced. Besides the bar, the service left me cold. My mini bar was warm and was not fixed after having reported the problem on my first morning. I had one 200ml cola for \u20ac5 and didn't really feel the urge to sample anything else at that price. I walked down the street towards town and found a shop after 20mins. Here I got 1.5L of Coke, 2 bags of nuts and some mints for \u20ac5. I kept the cola in the ample safe which was cooler than the minibar for the duration of my stay. The Camp Nou is a comfortable 20min walk and well worth a visit (\u20ac19). I reported the air conditioning not to be adjustable at the same time as the minibar problem but this wasn't fixed either. I left it turned off and found the temperature to be better this way. The free wifi worked very well in the room but not in the bar. The outdoor swimming pool was closed and I think there was a charge for the indoor one although I could be wrong about this. On the plus side, they printed my boarding pass for free and the hotel car to the airport was just \u20ac5 dearer than a taxi and very comfortable.

And for one very good reason. The hotel is not worthy of 5-stars. Deducting one of them would be more honest as the service and facilities are not equal to what you may expect of a hotel that claims 5 stars. And why not? When I checked-in at the hotel on the 12th Of July this Summer the front desk trainee could not find my reservation and asked for assistance from a colleague. Well, this is what happens, but what does not happen at a 5-star hotel is that the colleague corrects and speaks in a harsh and very demanding tone to the trainee in front of a hotel guest. That really does not get your mood up. This was may first bad experience - and right on arrival. Unfortunately there were many more to come. Actually so many that it would be too much to mention them all here. One of the most \"distracting\" experiences came during the night. The hotel rooms are very noisy and you can hear everything going on in the other rooms from listening in on the other guests conversations to nightly activities between lovers. Therefore, I asked for another room in the morning. The front desk staff was very annoyed with my request, asking if this was necessary and the person in the reception \"helping me out\" did not once apoligies for this matter. Finally I got a new room after waiting for 3 hours. I should never have asked for this room as it was even more noisy than the old one. Again this is not a 5-star hotel worthy!!! During my 3 day stay, I had many disappointing experiences. Big ones and small ones that you may laugh of like the fact that the front desk staff did not know what a \u201dband aid\u201d is and it took three people in the reception to get me one. And when I asked to borrow an iron, the hotel staff told me, that I could not borrow one for security reasons as it may set the building on fire. Well I stay more than 100 nights in hotels every year for business reasons, and this explanation from Hotel Rey Juan Carlos got me really scared, as it is usually never a problem to borrow an iron in a 5-star hotel. Right now I am in a 5-star hotel in Madrid, where I just borrowed and iron this afternoon. I hope nothing happens here tonight... In return Hotel Rey Juan Carlos did offer to iron my shirts for 7 euros a piece. Well perhaps this is more about business than security... Another fact that guest should be aware of is that the hotel is actually quite far away from the city life and the main attractions in Barcelona unless you want to go and see Camp Nou. Perhaps this explaines the low price as well. A more funny thing is, that in the hotel lobby there is a display showing all the celebrities that have earlier stayed at the hotel. Well I can only think, that a true 5-star hotel would not have to display such a thing... In other words.

On my third day I accidentally found that (free) breakfast was provided for conference attendees, I was not informed of this when checking in nor, as far as I could tell, was it advertized anywhere within the hotel. If you can find it, the hotel pool is wonderful, but we had to search as we were misdirected by the staff to the for-fee pool in the health spa. The architecture and d\u00e9cor don\u2019t help, but more importantly the style in which the hotel is run seems to attach little importance to the guests actually enjoying their stay. It\u2019s a shame as other than the hotel, my experience in Barcelona was wonderful.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, UK", "Title": "\u201c5 star hotel with 2 star internet service\u201d", "Author": "MMmd", "ReviewID": "UR67350966", "Content": "This is as good a high quality business hotel as I have ever stayed at. It is difficult to understand the very negative comments left on tripadvisor from some customers as my experience was very different. The prices of food and drink at this hotel are high compared to US hotels, but are really comparable to other \u201c5 star\u201d hotels in major European cities. I have 4 comments: a) Location. This hotel is away from the city centre and about a 15 minute taxi ride from the airport (20 euro minimum fare applied). There is a metro stop 5 minutes walk away and getting to any of the major sites or city centre involves a change. The metro is very easy to use, clean and frequent. Be aware that if you are coming for a convention, this may be some distance away. There are several convention centres in Barcelona and although one is virtually attached to the hotel, the main one (FIRA Gran Via) is a 20minute taxi ride away. b) The internet service at this hotel is poor and expensive. The cost of the internet service is 8/12/20 euro (without VAT which is 16% extra) for 1/2/24 hours respectively. The time is not transferable and once you start the period is continuous. The speed of the internet connection is really poor at whatever price. I mainly used the internet to deal with emails but it was painfully slow, irrespective to the time of day or night. I wonder if the management of this hotel ever do undercover work by looking at their competition. This is the most expensive and slowest internet service I have encountered in a hotel in the last 3 years. c) All prices at the hotel are exclusive of VAT which you pay on top on checking out. Can there really be any justification for not showing the true prices within the hotel? After all everywhere else you go in Spain all the prices include VAT. d) On checking out, you are meant to do so at the Cashier desk but there is no notice informing you of this. I stood in line for around 10-15 min for reception with everybody else checking in, only to be told they couldn\u2019t check me out and I should go to the cashier desk instead. It will be such a simple thing for the hotel to put up signs making it clear that the check in and check out take place at different desks.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Solihull, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery Handy for the Conference Centre\u201d", "Author": "DurbanGal", "ReviewID": "UR66178228", "Content": "Just stayed one night and it was great, walking distance to the convention centre.

The day we attempted to go to that pool, the spa was only partially available as they were filming some sort of video in the fitness areas & the pool bar was unopen. We were told we could only get water to drink.

Finally we had to be rude an just force ourselves on someone... anyone... - Location is far off the beaten path.

Do not stay here unless you like being ripped off and don't want to see the city of Barcelona. I spent 3 nights here with my wife in spring 2010 and I agree totally with some of the other reviews that describe this hotel's pricing as \"abusive\". An example of some of the ridiculous charges at this hotel: 20 Euro extra a night for internet? (That didn't work the entire time we were there.) 25 Euro extra a night for the 'privilege' of having a second person in a room (my wife)? (Evidently breakfast costs 25 Euro! and I was told it was not possible to opt out of it). 15 Euro to wash and dry one shirt. The rest of the food prices are just insane, literally. Oh, one of the receptionist at the front desk actually told us that \"there are no lavandarias in Barcelona\". (I have spent ~3 months in BCN, you can get your entire wardrobe cleaned for 15 Euro at lavandarias scattered on every block in the city). This gives you an idea of the quality of the reception desk. What a total joke. The hotel is also a very long way away from the center of the city -- the walk to the metro takes about 10 minutes and is the last stop on the metro's green line. If you are used to the typical Barcelona hotel that has many restaurants, cafes and other conveniences in a 2 block radius then this is not the place for you. If you are used to having really anything useful nearby this hotel is not for you. Another caution for anyone looking for a romantic getaway: beware this hotel's double room/single room groupings. We reserved a double room for two people and found two beds pushed together, bedded separately, with one comforter thrown overtop to give the illusion of a king-sized bed. It took an additional trip to the front desk to get us moved to a room with one bed that would sleep two people. And then it was a \"shared room\"--the kind with a locked door that could be opened to lead into the room next to us. And by the way, our room's shower leaked into the bathroom through a crack in the tile so if you needed to use the toilet you would first need to mop up. The A/C unit in the room we were in (and all the rooms I saw) rattled very very loudly when running. The beds are extremely hard. Be prepared for all this when you try to go to sleep. Basically, this hotel caters to customers with an expense account who are here to use the conference center. If that is you and you don't care about being charged an arm and a leg for every basic need and like being close to your conference, then go ahead and book. The hotel will feel the same to you as any standard 3 star hotel in the US and since your company is paying, who cares. However, if you actually care about getting what you pay for then my advice is to go find a different hotel. You can pay 1/2 as much for 2x more elsewhere. In summary, for all its attempts to be a \"Leading Hotel of the World,\" it failed miserably in our opinion. The abusive charges, poor room quality, isolated location, dingy business district surroundings and poor customer service will keep us from ever returning to Hotel Rey Juan Carlos in the future.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Paradise near Camp Nou\u201d", "Author": "Ismo56", "ReviewID": "UR55540543", "Content": "Me and my wife spent four days in beautiful Barcelona.

The truth is that I had read only the good news. I reserved two rooms deluxe with break fast included directly from the site of the hotel. It's true that is not close to the center of the town , but it's near (not close) the airport. Half an hour from airport by taxi. And half an hour from the center by metro and walking . there is a station near. The area is quiet but there is nothing thre for shopping or eating. Two station far ther are a Shopping mall an the Camp Nou. The rooms are good but not something excepcional comparing with other hotels of 5 or 4 stars in the same town. The ventilation was not suficient because the window (1rst floor) was permanently secured in the \"close\" position. The cleaning service was good but the bed-sheets were either being changed day by day or were not well -ironed. We haven't touched or opened the mini-bar , where a small bottle of natural water cost 5 euros. In other hotels, at least, u have 2 bottles of water for free. In the supermarket the same bottles of water cost 0,40 euros. The room-service was neither slow nor very fast but was very very expensive basis the quality of the food served. It;s not acceptable to serve \" fast food\" french fries. Which means were frozen and we paid aroud 20 euros for that hamburger. In the breakfast, there were a varity of items to select however I doubt about the quality. For many items I'm not sure when they were prepared e.g bacon very hard with strange taste, croissants not fresh , tortilla previous day remaing , coffee prepared hours ago and in great quantity so its appearance was black- not brown, as coffee has to be, and bitter. The jam was not the best quality ever seen, had the appearence of a jelly. The polo restaurant , the cold buffet cost arround 26 euros and the cold buffet with specialties( menu dishes) arround 40 euros. The kids menu approx. 19 euros... for a pasta with tomato sauce. I have noticed that there was a kind of \" policy\" to discourage clients- not prohibit- of having a second plate from the buffet. The presentation of the buffet was excelent. The food served in the buffet were mostly vegetables ,chicken and salamis. In the site of the hotel they offer high speed internet without clarifying that it is charched 8 euros/hour 12 euros /2hours 20/24hours which must be consumed the same day otherwise you lose the remaining unused time. Considering that the internet is offered almost everywhere for free, even in cafes , and in the majority of the hotels it is standard free service , it's totaly unacceptable to charge such amounts in a hotel of such class. Furthermore it;s not logical to pay extra 100 euros/day at least to have free internet, in the excecutive floor, among the additional meal services and newspapers. Generaly the behaviour of the personel was good , very kind. The entrance of the fittnes center was approx 23 euros , and was not clariied whether this amount is for the thermal area only.In addition there was no information about the fitness room use of exercise equipment was free or not . I haven,'t visited the spa area although i would like to cause I felt that the strategy of the hotel is to offer nothing complimentary or for free. However they suggest for FREE a route for jogging arround the hotel area. I haven't visit the bar cause I have n't seen the piano used by a musician.

Fortunately I had printed all information from the pages from Expedia and took those papers with me. When I gave those papers to clerk, she told that she had to talk to manager. Next day we were told to come back to reception (while waiting next day no food was offered). They said that lounge was closed and it wouldn`t be opened. Reason wasn`t told. They offered us free breakfasts. We accepted it, even though it was not at all same than \"four gastronomic presentations\". Everything was quite ok, until we saw that lounge was open. We went there to ask if it was opened for us too. The lounge clerk said that it was only for private party. So we waited for two more days and noticed that lounge was open all day long. We went back to ask it, and another clerk said that it was open for those who had bought it. So we went back to reception and they said that we couldn`t use lounge because we had accepted free breakfasts. BREAKFAST IS NOT THE SAME THAN FOUR GASTRONOMIC PRESENTATIONS IN PRIVATE LOUNGE. Our opinion was nothing. What next: I have never been in a 5-star hotel, where hotel employees can bring their friends to pool area and these \"guests\" occupy real guests sun beds. And these friends can enjoy their own food and beverages by pool, which was strictly prohibited from hotel guests. These \"guests\" came to pool via pool bar, where nobody controlled their coming. Hotel guests had to come via Fitness center reception, where room number was told. And what next, Fitness bar`s employee\u00b4s boyfriend was all day long behind this bar desk kissing the employee.

The lobby is spectacular, as described in other rewies. My standard room was quiet big, there was an LCD, an armchair with a table, a sofa, a pillow menu and all the other things I usually find in a 5 star hotel. The bathroom had a big bathub and a separate WC area and a (little) shower. Excelent bath products (there were even a razor kit, a dental kit and a comb). The pool is amazing and this is probaby the cheapest 5 star hotel of the city. CONS: on one day the breakfast room was full, so last customers were constrincted to have breakfast in an adjacent room. The waiter told me (in Spanish..) how this room was located and that there was no difference in term of selection of food but instead I noted that the selection of fruit was smaller and the hot chocolate was worse than the one I had in the principal breakfast room (located at the Polo restaurant). I don't think this is acceptable in every hotel of this world because all the guests pay the same price for breakfast. And I found this restaurant quiet disappointing for being the principal restaurant of a 5 star hotel because is located in a room without windows. Another cons is about SPA's prices: I am a frequent LHW customer and I found HRJC very expensive. All in all, this is a very good hotel for people who look for a beautiful pool, some luxury at reasonable price and don't need to stay in the city center (anyway easyble accessible with the metro).

Although I had a great stay, I identified two areas in which the hotel's management could make an effort to make their guests' stay even more enjoyable. 1. Although there are some shops selling jewelry and expensive designer clothes in the hotel, there is no shop selling basic toiletries. My luggage was lost by my airline and as there are no shops within walking distance of the hotel I had to take a taxi in the morning to buy deodorant and other basic supplies. Moreover, most shops outside the center of Barcelona only open around 10/11AM. I think it would be great if the hotel could stock some basic toiletries for its guests. 2.

Don't be put off by the grey tower block - the hotel interior and facilities are absolutely lush, in particular the pools, spa and fitness area which were lovelier than any other I've been to (even my expensive London gym). Its worth the stay just to use those facilities, especially on a hot hot day when you are sticky and sweaty after sightseeing. It's about 15-20 minutes into the centre of Barcelona by bus or metro from the Avenue Diagonal, and even after a big night out (in La Ribera - definitely preferable to the tacky Las Ramblas), we managed to find a bus home at 2am. The room was great - a massive bed, huge windows with a great view of Barcelona, and the most amaaaazing shower I can remember. My only advice - if you are not made of money, bring your own drinks and snacks for the room, and eat out locally rather than at the hotel. Each room has a minibar but - phew - costs started with a small pack of Pringles at 7 euros! Breakfast (which we ate out at a little cafe) was extortionate - 16 euros for a fruit platter, 5 euros for cereal and milk. Enough said.

This was when we encountered our only gripe about the hotel - its location. There was nothing in terms of shops or restaurants in the vicinity. This is probably one of the reasons we got a pretty good deal on the hotel. The situation was partially helped by complimentary welcome cava cocktail, orange juice and a large plate of crisps. Everything about the hotel is 5*. The staff were excellent, the room amazing, even with the additional bed for my daughter and the 2 pools were very relaxing after a hard day's sight seeing. Prices are also 5* - if you are on a bit of a budget there is a petrol station round the corner, on Diagonal, where pastries, fruit juice etc can be bought to allow a quick, cheap and mobile breakfast. The Universtat Metro stop is about 200 metres from the hotel, on Diagonal, so it didn'y take long to get into town. If you don't know Barcelona, the metro is clean, quick, reliable and I found it to be very safe. Another bonus is that the bus touristic has a stop close to the next metro station down the line. Again, this is walkable from the hotel and saved standing in line for yonks in the centre of town waiting to catch a bus - you can buy tickets on the bus. On the last day we walked to Camp Nou, home of Barcelona FC (about 15 minute walk). I thoroughly enjoyed the tour and started to get a real feel for the importance of the club in Catalonia, both socially and politically. I already liked the club - I was further converted. The bonus each night was that the hotel environs were very quiet (being out of town) and the rooms well sound proofed so we all had a good sleep.

The hotel is certainly not perfect, but on the whole I felt it deserved its 5 stars. The rooms were comfortable enough, and a good size. The staff were helpful and numerous. The conference facilities were excellent. As conference delegates, using the on-site conference facilities, we were very well looked after. I don't think I once had to queue to get a coffee during coffee breaks. When I had a problem with the AV equipment while I was giving a talk, it took very little time to find one of the tech support guys, who fixed the problem very quickly. So what of the criticisms that other users have made? Well, a couple of people commented on the lack of English language skills of some of the staff. I suspect they have unrealistic expectations. The front desk staff had absolutely fluent English, and while I'm sure not all the staff did, let's face it, the hotel is in Spain. I'll bet the price of a week's stay in this hotel that the average standard of English here is far better than the average standard of Spanish in any hotel in London. If you have language problems here, then frankly you're not even making an effort. One user commented on the lack of storage space in the bedrooms. Those criticisms are partly justified, partly not. It's true that there is no shelf under the sink in the bathroom for one's belongings, but there is almost certainly more room than you need on the surfaces around the sink to put anything you could possibly have brought with you, unless you've gone there with an entire pharmacy. However, there was rather minimal space in the rest of the bedroom in cupboards and drawers. I would have liked a draw or cupboard next to the bed, but there wasn't one. I had just about enough space to put away everything I brought with me, but if you're staying there for a week or more or just have never mastered the art of travelling light, then you may not. The criticism of the design causing the door between the bedroom and the corridor to get in the way of the wardrobes is spot on. It was a complete pain. Literally, in fact, as at one stage I caught my finger between the door to the room and the door to the wardrobe. If I were American, I'd probably sue them for it. Other people have criticised the air conditioning. It was actually just about OK for me, but I did have it turned up to max at the end of April and was certainly not too cold. I suspect it could be a problem if you're there in the summer. One complaint about this hotel, mentioned by other reviewers, which is entirely justified is the price. The room rate itself was actually perfectly reasonable by 5-star standards (although it was a special rate negotiated for our conference, so it may not always be so), but they really screwed you for all the extras. I am probably less price-sensitive than most people when it comes to things like grabbing a bottle of water from hotel mini-bars, but even I took one look at the prices and immediately went for a little walk to try to find somewhere else to buy a bottle of water (head towards the university campus, turn left off the Diagonal at the metro station, and go along the road in front of the big official palace-looking building to get to the shops). I think \u20ac5 for a small bottle of mineral water is a new record in my experience. Other things were like that too: internet access, room service, drinks in the bar, laundary: you name it, they overcharged for it. Some of my colleagues were particularly annoyed that they wouldn't provide you with an iron, so if you turned up with a crumpled shirt then you had to pay their outrageous laundary prices if you wanted it pressed. If you have a travel iron, make sure you pack it. Anyway, despite all that, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The conference was great, and everyone at the hotel seemed to do their best to make sure that it was. The hotel has a lovely garden, which is a great place for relaxing in. However, one other drawback of this hotel, which would be particularly annoying if you are there for fun rather than work, is the location. It is in the middle of nowhere, and if you want to see any of the interesting bits of Barcelona (apart from the Cervantes rose garden, which is more or less just opposite the hotel, and absolutely stunning), then you need to spend the best part of half an hour in a metro or taxi to get there. For that reason, if I go back to Barcelona for a holiday, it is extremely unlikely I'll stay there again. But if you're considering going there for a conference, then go for it!", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cluxury hotel for pleasure\u201d", "Author": "andreaspas", "ReviewID": "UR15478142", "Content": "excellent servise, nice spa area, wonderfull view, expencive, 5 min from metro, away from the center,clean", "Date": "April 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel but with flaws\u201d", "Author": "Cooki", "ReviewID": "UR13072109", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights while attending a convention in the nearby Pallau de Conressos which is some 15-20 minutes taxi ride from Las Ramblas.

Even a Golf course not too far away. Decent sized room, tastefully decorated. Bathroom nicely equipped. Few negative things now : First of all it can get very expensive! Room service menu items are 30-40 euros per dish, internet costs EUR 40 per day which is not very fast. Shower cubicle nice but mine had a rusty ceiling.

In fact, the in-room service charges were some of the most outrageous experienced - ever. And, I've been privilaged to stay at some fairly luxurious places.

The five star rating makes sense from the perspective of hotel amenities - high end bathroom, excellent bed, full service, flat screen TV, etc. From an international business perspective, the five stars make a little less sense. The hotel was full of people from all over Europe, the U.S. and the Persian Gulf, but very few staff had enough English to interpret any but the most basic requests. When on vacation, it's my job to know the host hotel's first language. When traveling on business in a luxury business hotel, it's their job to have enough English to accomodate international travelers. This was particularly frustrating when speaking to the hotel operator on the phone - e.g. I asked for an electrical adaptor and the response was \"what time do you want the wake up call?\" The concierge and front desk staff had very good English, so there was always a recourse - but it often involved going down to the desk. (The adaptor episode led to a very drawn out adventure where I was certain the housekeeping staffer would start a fire - in her zeal to be helpful, she was attaching several appliances with incompatible voltages together, and I had to use body language and some high school theater background to register my increasing alarm). The staff was universally friendly and eager to please; sincere intention to take care of guests was ever-present. Wireless did not work in my guest room but worked very well in the lobby. Wired internet access in the guest room is 20 Euros - that's 30 bucks for you Americans, and reinforces my irritation that higher-end hotels love nickle and diming us to death. From a design perspective, I give the hotel mixed reviews. Strengths included an easy to navigate hotel footprint, attractive modern design, the incredible mattress - I had no back pain for the entire stay, and others in my group had similar feedback; linens and pillows were abundant and very high quality. Plenty of work and sitting space, tons of closet space. Weaknesses - will someone shoot these designers for me, please? I think half the people who design hotel rooms never actually sleep in one. The odd sweeping diagonal of the entrance to the sleeping room meant that you must have the door to your sleeping area closed in order to fetch your clothes - this caused endless awkward reaches for things in the closet. But the most senseless was the bathroom. Beautiful granite finishes - but the counter space was minimal and piled with signs and amenities - with no shelf space underneath for the guest's actual belongings. This is one of my pet peeves. Where am I supposed to put my medications, hair stuff, lotions, potions? This is all more important to me than whatever soap or shampoo the hotel thinks I need. The shower design was actually dangerous - the tiny shower booth had a flimsy, aluminum-framed glass door which cracked when I pulled it shut. Despite two requests, nobody fixed it - and it could have shattered into the shower stall. But since the shower itself was so small you couldn't extend an arm in any direction, and since the only shelf space for toiltetries was 2 inches by 2 inches, I opted for the luxurious tub with shower attachment instead. The entrance to the toilet (also flimsy frame with glass) was less than 24 inches wide, so you had to be very careful entering it lest you incur a bruise or break the door - and there was also a bidet in there . . . taking up useful space. Re: temperature. The bellman helpfully told me that guests can only adjust the temperature 2 degrees on their own; any other adjustments must be managed by front desk, and the heat was blasting all over the building, even though it was quite temperate. (Our meeting room was exhaustingly overheated most of the time). Four phone calls and I was able to get the heat off in the sleeping room and get it cool enough to sleep in. The hotel has a very nice relaxed restaurant with a fine buffet breakfast that caters to many cultures. It did take a heroic act of intervention to get a cup of coffee and banana to carry away one morning when I was in a hurry. As a business hotel, it's important that guests can accomodate their meeting schedules with the ability to vittle themselves on their own. There is also no sundry shop on site, so tough luck if you forgot any key items. I didn't find the transportation a barrier - a 25 minute cab ride or metro ride downtown got me wherever I needed to go. A couple of other things I appreciated - an oversized hotel safe, big enough for computer, jewelery, money, shoes, a small pet . . . and a remarkably helpful concierge who gave me special advice about maintenance on the metro that saved my one day off to sightsee.

Staff service was not good. Only the reception staff spoke English well, other staff had considerable trouble understanding basic communication. We had an over priced lunch in the main foyer, costing upwards of 20 EUR for a very small sandwich and had to wait 30 mins to pay as there was no staff to be seen, only after going to reception was someone sent so we could pay. Service generally was slow but they did try hard. Rooms were comfortable but I did have a bed that squeaked every time I took a breath. Bathrooms were nicely fitted out though. The free spa is excellent, with steam rooms, aromatherapy steam sessions, sauna's, hydrotherapy pools etc. This is all free if you are staying at the hotel however, if you do not bring your slippers from the room you have to pay 2 EUR for flip flops and if you want to use the indoor pool its 5 EUR to purchase a swimming cap. Note of caution the spa area is separated male/female so be aware once you enter with your partner you will not see them again except in the indoor pool area. I met a lady who was with her husband and they had not realized so she was sitting all alone in the hot tub looking a bit lost. Not the romantic spa weekend away that they had planned. They also have a good fitness area, massage and treatments, salon and a range of classes such as dance and yoga for an extra fee. If you suffer from vertigo (afraid of heights) then ask for a lower level room. There are 4 lifts 2 of which are glass and run the full height of the hotel. Rooms open out onto walkways that look down into the main foyer. The Garden restaurant was very nice, not too expensive and the food was great. A good setting for a romantic dinner.

The room we had on the 6th floor was very comfortable with views to the rear of the hotel over the David Lloyd tennis club. There are a few things to take into account however: 1. Room facilities - there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room nor can you ask for an iron or ironing board. 2. Everything is chargeable so morning tea or coffee has to be ordered from room service and housekeeping will charge you 7 euros to iron your shirt. 3. Breakfast in the restaurant is about 26 euros each! On the plus side checking in and out was very efficient and speedy and the English speaking concierges are extremely good.
