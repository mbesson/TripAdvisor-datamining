The front desk said come on in our room would be ready. When we arrived it WAS NOT ready and we had to come back later. Our reserved room had a broken pull out bed, the carpet was dirty, the toilet seemed like at anytime it could be a danger zone!! I immediately went to the front desk to ask if there was another room available with a pull out bed that you could sleep on which at this point we were all totally exhausted from the long drive and just wanted to sleep. I had to upgrade to The Presidential Suite (I hope we haven't had any Presidents stay in this room because it would be an embarrassment). We had to literally go down to the front desk for pillows and blankets to the pull out bed because they DO NOT deliver them to you or keep extra in the rooms. I decided to walk down the stairs to the front desk for the items and talk about dirty. It seems this area has never been vacuumed or cleaned. Dirty, Dirty, Dirty. Even a gentlemen in the elevator on the way back up to the room said he was checking out after seeing his room and how dirty the hotel was. I was not compensated for having to change rooms due to the broken pull out couch, broken toilet, etc. in any way. This was suppose to be a four day getaway with my daughter and future son in law to show them Memphis. I was embarrassed to have them stay with us in this hotel and should have check out. I had already made all my reservations, unloaded all our bags and just thought we were too too tired to go to some other hotel. Too bad their Memphis memory was taunted the first day of arrival!!!

I made my reservations thru expedia. When we arrived the rooms that we were promised were not available. Terry the sales manager gave us what we thought was the hookup. (she was very nice) We had an executive suite each, which was like staying in a large motel 6 room. The hotel was very old, you could tell. My wifes mother went with us and stayed in the suite with my wife and i. When we went to bed the first night we closed the pocket door between the room and the living room, the next morning my wife got up to use the rest room and couldnt open the door. I had to get up and lift the door while sliding it back. (it was off the track) we reported it and was told that the owner knows about it but wont fix it, and the same problem was in my parents suite. First of all i would never pay the asking price for those rooms that they charge. I would have gotten my money back if i had. The TV looked like it was about to go out, it was real dark. I picked this hotel because of the price and the close proximity to Beale St. The breakfast was what i expected, it was good for being free with the room. My wife loved the indoor pool, her and her mom enjoyed swimming in it. I can see that they are slowly trying to fix it up, but until they get the rooms done it should be really discounted for anyone who wants to stay there. Its in bad need of updating. The carpet, the walls, the AC system, the televisions. I would stay there again, only because the closer you get to Beale St the more expensive it gets. For the price we paid it was worth someplace to lay your head and sleep. We spent most of our time away from the hotel, and it was at least clean, just old and dated. The bed was real comfortable.

I asked staff if this hotel used to have smoking rooms they said yes, so I may have had a former smoking room. More gripes; the sleeper sofa did not have bedding - I had to go to the front desk to get sheets and make the bed. The sofa mattress was worn out, lumpy, and had stains & crumbs on it. The general condition of the room was substandard, there were a lot of patches on the wall that were left unfinished, some baseboard trim was missing, light bulbs by the bed were burned out, a few spots of food on the wall by the sink, smudged up wall by the sofa and mold in the shower.
