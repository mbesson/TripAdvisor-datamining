We came home one night from shopping all day to find that our door was WIDE OPEN!! Apparently, the cleaning crew left it open. I know they were there because we had clean towels and the beds were made up. Anyone could have come in and hid in the bathroom! It was a little scary.

Plus, the shower head hit me right in the chest so I had to get on my knees to wash my hair. The bathroom really dated the place....early 1960's. The kids liked the breakfast, but the foam in the pitcher told me that was powdered milk so I stayed away. I kind of like a place to relax with my family when I'm not running around and this wasn't it. My wife and I stopped by 5 or 6 places before we left and took a look at the rooms.

We got a room with a king size bed and whirlpool (next to night stand). Our room was at the lower level in the back.

The numbering of room levels was a little confusing. In the room you could hear construction and some traffic noise at times. The room itself had a slight odor, probably from water damage which was evident from the warped bottom of night stand next to the bed. The shower was a stand up model with a liquid soap dispenser. The toilet seat was squeaky when you raised it. There was a sink, small fridge and microwave, all worked. The window air conditioner made the room cold fast. The king size bed was comfortable.

We came by it through a time-share freebie in Branson and the other places we could choose from were riskier options according to what we could find on the internet. But we were pleasantly surprised by the clean, spacious, newly remodeled jacuzzi room we upgraded to for a mere $25, which was $20 less than what the time share people wanted for an upgrade. There were only a handful of other cars in the parking lot. We parked right outside our door. The front desk was very responsive and accomodating, except for the refusal to give us 2 inroom coffee packets for the inroom single coffee maker. For $25 we got a microwave, small fridge and clean, romantic 2 person jacuzzi. The carpet was clean with an iron imprint near the bathroom door. The was a separate shower. There was a crack in the side of the jacuzzi tile and the door lock which had just been changed out would not take the card or a replacement card. They finally gave us a key. The free 'continental' breakfast from the hotel was a buffet across the street at Dockers Restaurant, I assume due to the few patrons the hotel had while we were there. The maid was likewise friendly, and got us the extra coffee we had requested. Another review to add here for those interested in a show. Stay away from \"spirit of the dance\" unless you do not mind recorded tap routines. We were disappointed that the dancers were not tapping out their impressive choreography live... it was all recorded. For a hair salon, go to \"Curl up and dye\" at the Victorian village on Shepard of the Hills (red route) Good service and prices and massage also.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cStay o.k.\u201d", "Author": "bigbopper26", "ReviewID": "UR6132648", "Content": "We stayed here in October.
