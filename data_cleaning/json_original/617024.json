First of all, the staff were absolutely terrible. Could not be worst. I have never seen any thing like this in any of my trips all over the world. A friend of mine had booked this hotel trough a travel agent and the money was not refundable (that was why I stayed there for two nights). The check-in process was exhausting and unbearably long, being done by the most horrible reception/front desk clerk I have ever seen. She was rude and would not miss an opportunity to make you feel terrible about your luck and life course which has led you here. When the check-in was finished, she kept my passport in her desk drawer (unlike other hotels in UAE who scan your passport immediately hand it back to you). I politely asked her to give my passport back and she yelled at me \"later, perhaps this afternoon\". I asked for a receipt for the passport and my response was a smirk. I explained that I would need the passport or a receipt for it if a police officer stops me in the street (well, I frankly did not need it that bad, but felt that I had to do some thing about her behavior). She yelled again, almost screaming, and repeated her answer \"perhaps this afternoon\". It took me another fifteen minutes or so of arguing but I could not get my passport, neither she gave me a receipt for it. I was escorted to my room by another rude man. He came to my room, just to show me the contents of my minibar - but his main mission was to make me sign a paper showing the minibar content. Apparently they thought I might steal something from the minibar and later claim that it had not been there from the beginning. The room was OK - well, if you only take appearance into account. My room had formerly been a connecting room so there was a door to the adjacent room in it. The problem is that this door - as well as the walls - was so thin that I had to listen to the couple in the adjacent room making love all night long for two nights. It was as if I was present in their room. Horrible. Imagine for yourself. The room came with breakfast and lunch. Did not try breakfast, after I tried the lunch the first day. First of all, they had not forgotten to put an equally-rude lady in charge of the lunch room. I was there the first day with a friend and they asked him (because he was not a hotel guest) to pay 35 Dirhams. My friend, half joking, told the lady that the price could be lower considering the quantity and quality of foods. She screamed into his face \"why don't you go somewhere else, where it is cheaper?\" poof. The lunch was very basic and the quality of desserts were unbelievably low. There is a club down there in the lobby, a Persian one. You might not believe me when I tell you that they asked for 150 Dirhams for each person just to go in. No drinks included. It's unheard of, I believe, in Dubai (for such a place). Of course we laughed and went away. You might say you are not going to have anything to do with the club, but the club will definitely have something to do with you. on Friday and Saturday nights there is no way you can sleep easily - the club is so loud you cannot hear the booms and bangs even if you are staying in 6th floor, like me. I believe this hotel is being used by Iranian tours and they basically bring here some Iranian tourists as a part of a package deal (in which case, you cannot change your hotel if you like to). I feel pity for the people who have to come here and stay. I am not a picky person and I am professional traveler, so take my advice and DO NOT STAY HERE, not even for a single night. I would sleep in the park next time if I have to. The funny thing is that it is not even cheap. I paid around 400 Dirhams per night (it is a four star!). I could have stayed in much nicer places for this money.

The hotel is located in the very center of Dubai/Deira, in walking distance to the clock tower. However, one should bear in mind that it may be rather unwise to walk around at daytime when it is about 40+ degrees hot and extremely humid. The hotel has a pool, a roof top bar (they serve cold Heineken) and a night club on the ground floor. Staff was very friendly and supportive. This is about the biggest plus of the hotel, apart from its central location (see above). The Room was unclean and stinky, and even substantial airing didn\u2019t help as some previous guest must have smoked heavily in this non-smoker room. Daily cleaning didn\u2019t really improve the degree of cleanliness. The toilet stunk despite daily cleaning. Most annoyingly, the bumping beat of the nightclub music made its way night after night up to the fifth floor where we were staying, which made sleeping in times somewhat difficult. The pool was filled with filthy water. They had the results of an (impeccable) bacteriological analysis on display \u2013 dates back from March. The breakfast buffet was nothing spectacular, but ok. Again, staff was very helpful and nice.

I found a few that fitted budget and just went for the one that seemed to tick most peoples boxes and had least negative complaints - now dont get me wrong, this one had a few bad reviews but I'll give itmy best shot to be objective. First off, i was chuffed to be met off my flight by a hotel driver - i wasnt sure if they did free shuttles and when i got emirates to ring the hotel to ask for me (by the way, Emirates is the only way to get here - do a fab job) they patched me to the driver who said he was waiting for me with a sign - that will teach me to look. Most hotels i have stayed at in the past have all charged for the shuttle service or ive had to get a taxi. On arrival, i was aware i was 5 hours early for check in, however, when i asked if i could drop my bags and go to the pool, they told me my room would be ready in 10 min and to help myself to breakfast while i waited - again, FOC!!! They ask for your passport when i checked in and I wasnt sure if i would get it back, however, they returned it as soon as i asked without any problem - i think they just take a copy for their records. The hotel is next to a new build of apartments (to try and find one thats not next to contruction work in Dubai is fairly difficult!) but in faireness, I didnt hear any noise - i was on the 3rd floor, room 230 on te other side. The rooms are clean, comfy and fairly up to date decor wise. IT was as quiet as could be expected for a downtown hotel. Pool was nice - if you like watching contrution and airplanes then this is the place to relax! Serious though, its alright - fab service from the staff and pool bar team. Addd bonus is they have wifi on the roof and in reception - in the rooms they have a wired connection (but this is not obvious). Food wise - its ok. Breakfast is more than adequate (I stuck to omlettes cooked by the chef) and the one and only dinner i had in the resaturant was ok - there are better places to eat on the main street 5 mins walk away if you want more choice. Staff - not one person was unhelpful. They remember your face and room number with spooky ease and are always at your service. Summary: Good service, Good Value, Good Hotel.
