The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have seen with just about every breakfast food on the menu on display.

We got back from our trip this afternoon and had a fantastic time. Other than the obvious attractions of Berlin as a destination (just not enough time to do everything so we're already planning a return visit!), this hotel was a perfect base for us to explore the city. We travelled as a couple and spent most of the day out and about, so all we needed was a reasonably-sized room, a comfortable bed and good bathroom facilities. I can't comment on facilities for families, the quality of the food other than breakfast, or how problems are handled, as we have no experience of these things. The hotel is very well situated near the zoo and a number of U-bahn, train and bus services. Most of the city is walkable from the hotel if you want, but bring good comfy shoes! There is also some great shopping and eating in the neighbourhood, which is quite a buzzy and cosmopolitan one. The positives: the welcome and the general standard of service, from the Reception Desk and elsewhere, was warm and professional. They were happy to provide advice or recommendations, and when our room was a little too warm on the first night (cold winter equals all radiators on full blast, and ours had no obvious on/off switch) all we had to do was ask and they sent someone up to fix the problem. Similarly, when we used the free PCs to check in for our return flight the receptionist copied our boarding cards on a data stick and printed them out for us- a lovely touch. The Reception, Restaurant area and Bar are all beautifully appointed, and the public toilets in the basement are spotless. Service in all areas is polite, friendly and unintrusive. The rooms are nice- not the biggest or the most luxurious in the world but clean, smart and more than adequate for a city break where the point is not to spend all your time in the hotel. And they are pretty well appointed, with really comfy beds and plenty of storage options. The bathroom is also well-equipped and the shower is pretty powerful without flooding the whole room, which is often a problem with over-bath showers. Breakfast was also really nice- a huge choice of food and you can go back and refill your plate as many times as you want, so you can really stock up ahead of a hard day's walking. The not so good bits? There is currently renovation work going on in the building next door, and the noise from that would be pretty intrusive if you wanted to rest or sleep during the day. No idea how long this work is scheduled to go on for, but if the noise might be a problem for you, you might want to ask before booking. Additionally (and this might just be our room but then again maybe not), the bathroom door wasn't a great fit and you had to give it a real 'heave' to get it closed. The door handle is so close to the door frame that when you pull it closed, you invariably take all the skin off your knuckles! A small detail but easy to fix- change the door handles and shave a bit off the door, and presto, no more niggles. The minibar was pricey and a bit shabby, and the safe required a key to lock it, which may or may not have been available from Reception, but like a lot of stuff in our room it came with no instructions- a bit of an oversight which meant we didn't get the most from the TV, safe, air conditioning, and couldn't even switch off our own heater. Breakfast, although nice, was not included in our room rate and was also quite expensive. Make sure you're hungry if you want to take it, so you get your money's worth. Or do what the chap sitting opposite us did, and use the bread, ham and cheese to make a load of sandwiches and smuggle them out in his briefcase, presumably to save money on his lunch. In summary? Yes, we'd definitely book this hotel again. It's nice, offers good value for money, and is in a very good location with great facilities nearby and good transport links. Other than a couple of tiny details, we couldn't really find any fault and would certainly recommend it. It feels like a place which is certainly 'on the up' and I'm sure those little niggles will be straightened out in time.

NOT a 4 * hotel.\u201d", "Author": "MagadogFinland", "ReviewID": "UR123547623", "Content": "In general, I've never been so disappointed with a hotel. With everything from the booking to the reseption to the rooms to the service; all was BAD. I've been to almost 40 countries, and three times to Berlin, and this hotel is about the worst of all, due to the attitude they have. First of all, it was impossible to get an answer to my emails from the hotel. We had bought vouchers from Groupon, and I emailed all the addressess found for the hotel. Then I emailed the representatives of the hotel's chain. No answer, to any of my emails regarding a reservation enquiry. And I emailed at least 10 times. Well, as there was no other way to get contact, as I couldn't get through by phone either, I asked from Groupon, and they said that the hotel had had some problems with their emails, but everything should be fine now. Ok, so I emailed yet again. No answer. Furstrated, I made the reservation through booking.com, writing into the booking about the problems with their emails, and after that I also emailed the hotel directly about having to have reserved through booking.com as they did not respond to anything. Guess what? No answer. I was quite worried, but as I'd been to Berlin twice before I knew I'd find a hotel in case the Excelsior would not provide us with the rooms. Well, when arriving at the hotel, we received our rooms and the receptionist did not comment anything when I explained our problems. Ok, so all was well we throught. We had reserved one superior and one standard double, and asked if we could have two superiors (I had emailed about that too..) as we travelled as two couples, the other with two under 2 year olds. The receotionist said they had upgraded the family into a superior as well, due to the babycot. Well, when we went into the rooms, our rooms was not a superior, as there was barely enough room to walk around the bed. Really tiny, Italian size room, which we did not expect. We went to see the familyroom, and that indeed was a bit bigger. So it seemed that we had got a standard nevermind what the receptionist said. Too tired to complain, we settled with that. The next morning the couple with the family went for an early breakfast, which was included in our vouchers. The receptionist (a man, different from the night before), said that our bookings do not include breakfast, and that they should pay 18 euros per person for it. Our friends tried to explain that it was included in the voucher, and the man lost his temper and started demanding that we have to PAY for the first night because we did the booking the wrong way. And he did not let my friends and their kids to go to breakfast before they had paid! At this point my friends came to wake me up, I took all my papers with me and went to talk with the man. He insisted that the whole thing was OUR fault, and that we had to pay for the first night, then cancel our booking at booking.com and then we could stay with the vouchers. I explained again about the connection problems, and he just shook his head and said there were no troubles, never had been, and smiled! That clearly we had not booked properly, and all of this was just our problem and we had to pay. I started to get really angry as he treated us like criminals, and insisted that he ask the manager or someone else to come, as he was not willing to even listen to us, let alone try to solve the problem. Finally after reluctantly speaking on the phone with someone he said that we had to prove that we had emailed them, and so I went to one of the computers in the lobby to print out my emails to them. After seeing them the guy finally called someone, and then reluctantly said that \"ok, this is now ok.\" No apology, not even a \"sorry\", just \"you can now have breakfast\". And then he went on to the next guest at the counter like nothing had happened. I was so angry I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a four star hotel!!! Other downsides; - the cups and plates at the breakfast always run out, there were never enough. - At the first breakfast we we were asked coffee or tea, took coffee, and then saw that other people around us were having cappucinos and lattes, which we were not offered. Oh well, decided to ask for that the next morning. However, when we did that, the waitress said that the coffee machine was broken, and it remained broken for the rest of our stay. - Our friends asked for more towels on the first day, as they had the two kids, but despite asking again and again, they had to manage the whole stay with 4 people and two towels. - Our vouchers included late check out, but the receptionist (yet another different person) just said \"we're fully booked, that is not possible\"! - Then, when we were leaving for the airport they called us a cab (needed a bigger one with the kids), and said it would come at 18.00. At 17.50 a big cab came to the front of the hotel, but we were packing the kids etc. in the lobby, and assumed that the cabby or the receptionist would come to tell us if it was ours, as we were right in front of the counter, and the girl at the reception had asked where we'd be waiting. We went on packing our stuff and went to the bathroom, and at a few minutes past six I looked and saw the cab still there. I asked the reception and the girl just said \"oh yes that's yours\". Pardon my french but WTF kind of service is this?!?! - Also, the bathrooms downstairs of the restaurant were apaulling; literally there was actual brown materia around the floors on two different occasions when I went there. In different stalls. - When we were checking out, we had the rooms till 12.00. At 10.30 the maid started to knock and ask if she could clean, we refused. A moment later, when we went to our friends room down the hall, she came again. Then she went to harass our friends again, about the same issue. She went on to peek into the rooms everytime we moved our stuff or otherwise opened the door. - the rooms were worn, the design was ok but it could be seen that it had been a while since any renovations. E.g. our mirror was cracked. The one and only nice thing I have to say about this \"hotel\" is that the lobby downstairs is designed nicely.

Would not recommend this hotel. I am still very angry about this hotel. Basically with toddler in tow and not a great flight we arrive on a cold winter evening. Our toddler had just got to sleep and had managed to acquire a cough from somewhere. So we arrive at reception to be told that the hotel is overbooked. Do not understand as we booked through hotels.com and have never had a problem before? Anyway they said they would send us to another 5 star hotel a short distance away for the first night. (couldn't care if it was a 7 star!) ALL WE WANTED WAS A ROOM TO PUT OUR TIRED BABY INTO WE HAD A CONFIRMED RESERVATION, WE HADNT JUST WALKED IN FROM THE STREET. So whatever they offered me had basically spoilt the first day of our city break (packing and unpacking is a nuisance). We came back second day as we were staying 4 nights as we didn't really have a choice and we were not going to pay again. Got back in the room to find a fruit plate in cellophane, but it really was the principle I would rather they got it right the first time than sent a cheap fruit plate to the room. I think this happens quite a lot being overbooked as the hotel we went to seemed to act like this was a regular occurrence, we met lots of other people who were unhappy too. All fur coat and no knickers for sure! Rooms small, very noisy! Lots of bits broken in rooms, lots of other lovely hotels in Berlin. Also if you know that it was going to be overbooked maybe send out an email in advance, it is 2011 you know! be interesting to see a management response on this one, don't trust anything they say now.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, very good value 4 star hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Travelupdate", "ReviewID": "UR121328422", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from an enjoyable 4 night stay at the Excelsior. The hotel is conveniently located on Hardenbergstrasse, in the west of the city. It is close to the main shopping street, Kurfurstendamm ( also known as Ku\u2019Damm). We had a comfortable room (515) which was spacious, clean and nicely furnished. We booked the break through \u2018Trailfinders\u2019 and the price included a good buffet breakfast with plenty of choice. From check-in through to check-out all the staff we met were pleasant, courteous, helpful and efficient. Three new Apple computers are available in the lobby for use by hotel guests, free of charge. There is also decent sized gym and a small library in the lobby. In summary the Excelsior is a very good place to stay either for business or pleasure. Tips \u2013 getting to the Excelsior from Tegel international airport is easy. There is an excellent airport bus service, the X9. It takes around 20/25 mins from Tegel to the Zoologischer Garten bahnhof (cost 2.30 euro single). From the railway station it is only a short walk of around 300 metres to the hotel in Hardenbergstrasse. The Berlin Welcome card is good value. Cost 24.90 euro for 72 hours card gives unlimited travel by bus, train and U bahn. The card also gives discounts on entrance fees for tourist attractions. Recommend the bus route number100 which leaves from the Zoologischer Garten taking you past many of the Berlin landmarks to Alexanderplatz. Berlin has many excellent shops. Would recommend a visit to the KaDeWe department store on Tauentzienstrasse (only a 15 minute walk from the Excelsior). It\u2019s a shoppers delight. Good food at reasonable prices in Le Buffet restaurant on the top floor of the store. Reichstag \u2013 If you want to visit then make sure you book in advance. Online registration is available so think about booking before you travel to Berlin. We were not aware of this so missed out. A visit Potsdam is recommended. It\u2019s a lovely city with many places of historical interest. The journey by S-Bahn train from the Zoologischer Gardens bahnhof takes around 30 minutes and the price of the rail ticket was included in the Berlin Welcome card. It\u2019s well worth doing the city and palace tour which starts and finishes at the Potsdam bahnhof. The 2.5 hour tour we took cost 20 euro but there is a 25% reduction with a Welcome Card.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jeanette B", "ReviewID": "UR121311082", "Content": "We had a perfectly lovely time at this hotel....all was good...apart from the beds on wheels!!!!!", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "adereth", "ReviewID": "UR121196475", "Content": "Good location, a short walk from some good shopping, and not far from a subway station.

We spent 7 nights in this hotel and every morning I could hear the extrememly loud clattering of some sort of machine in the staff room next to our room. The door squeaked horribly...imagine metal screetching on metal. Every time I called the front desk only to be told they would take care of it., whoch they did not. On the 6th morning when I was RUDELY wokem up to drilling above my head at 7am, myself and another guest went to the front desk. The manager came up to see what the noise was, heard it and promptly went up to the floor above. His response when he came back: \"Just one more nail.\" Long story short, I demnded and got my room changed for my last night. More complaints: one night coming back to room, we had no towels. Another time, no toilet paper. The chef in the open kitchen was tasting our food and licking his fingers as he prepared the dishes. We even saw him stir the potatoes and then lick the spoon! When I heard his smacking noise one time too many, I complained to the manager and his response: \"He must taste the food.\" My parents were told they too could have their room moved, but to come back at the end of the day and their things would be moved. We come back to hear they do not have any rooms available and their old room is still not made up. Also, the beds are 2 twins pushed together with a very hard mattress. The comforter is cozy, but that is all the niceities I will say. They have remodeled the rooms and cut them in half since when my parents stayed here 5 yeras ago, but even they will never recommend this place to anyone again.

It was our first trip to Berlin and I made the rookie mistake of taking a taxi from Schonefeld. This is a BAD idea - the hotel website says a taxi from Tegel is \u20ac15 or so but it's twice that from Schonefeld so take the train if you can. It's only \u20ac2.80 and the Zoo station is very close to the hotel. Most of west Berlin's attractions are close to the hotel, in fact. Because we were there in December, there was a Christmas market within 10 minutes' walk of the hotel at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (which is preserved in its bombed-out state). We were also close to the Ku'damm, the Zoo, a cinema and many cafes and bars. We took a walk to Savignyplatz twice as there's a few nice, simple Italian restaurants in the corner near the S-Bahn station. A pretty good walking tour of Berlin starts at the McDonald's near the Zoo station, that was well worth it if you have 4 hours to spare. And as for the hotel, it was great. The only minus point I'd take from it was the lack of internet facilities. I'm sorry, but I would take free wi-fi as a given these days, yet the Excelsior persists (as does most of Germany by the looks of it) with a pay as you go service that equated to around \u20ac20 a day. There was an ethernet wire next to the TV but it wouldn't work and reception, who in fairness sent someone up to investigate, said that the server was offline and would be back in an hour. That was day 2 and it never worked for our whole time there. It was a pity, because in other hotels we've stayed in, we use the net to look up things to do and make bookings. As a result of this lack of internet (I refuse to pay for it, it was extortionate in any case), I was always on the look-out for somewhere to go online and it really was a pain. Even the PC beside reception cost the same to use the internet, it's like they're determined to get paid for what's normally a free service. Leaving that aside, the hotel is great. The room was roomy and clean, the bathroom spacious, the TV, while laborious to get to any channels, was fine. We'd asked for a double and got a twin with two beds pushed together but they were fine. Breakfast was included and was a pretty good buffet, especially their selection of bread. The newspapers at the entrance to the buffet looked complimentary and there was no sign up to suggest there was a charge, until we saw the bill at the end. We also got room service one evening, which was ok. The staff at the Excelsior were fantastic though. They were very helpful, allowing us to check-in at midday. They also have a nice selection of pamphlets etc. with which you can plan excursions etc. It's quite 70's inside but it's well-maintained so I could forgive them for that.

Overall, for the price we got, it was value for money. Pros - Location, location, location! We were so happy with how close Excelsior was to the Zoologischer Garten train station and Kurfurstendamm (shopping street). It is 15 - 20 mins walk to the KaDeWe (famous mall in Berlin). Perfect Location if you don't want to spend time getting a cab or taking the subway. We pretty much walked everywhere. Tour buses are also available around the block (go down Faranstrasse) to take you to the main attractions (Wall, Checkpoint Charlie). Zoo is literally down the street. There are lots of places to eat, and a supermarket down the street to get snacks etc. Walking tours are also available which meet right across from the Zoologisher Garten Station. We spent most of our time outside the hotel so didn't mind they had no pool, gym, spa etc. Staff were attentive, shampoo bottles and soap was missing from our bathroom, we told the concierge and they gave it right away. Towels and bathroom were clean. You would need your room card to scan the switch to use the lights - it was energy efficient and environmentally friendly. We didn't eat breakfast or have meals in the hotel. Walk along Kurfurstendamm and you'll find tons of places to eat. I suggest the Bratwurst Booth that sells the best currywurst in Berlin. Bathroom and towels were clean (no stains) and the shower had a good water pressure. Cons - Room was small. We got a room with a King Size Bed. Usually, other 4-star hotels have a small table and a couple of chairs or a sofa, but this one only came with one chair and a narrown wall table. There was no space where you can take your meal back to your room and eat. It still has that 70's appeal so it is not chic at all, they have a sign saying they are \"upgrading\" the hotel on the front desk but I didn't really see any construction going on. They do need some kind of make-over to really call themselves a 4-star. There are scratches on the hardwood tables, frame of the bed etc. Even the signs on the hallway and doors look like they were still from the 70's/80's. The hairdryer looked like a vaccum cleaner and was very weak. It took forever to dry my hair.
