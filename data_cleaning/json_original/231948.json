Would have probably graded higher if not for price and four-star rating. This hotel is in the midst of expanding. It bought the building next door and knocked down a wail to connect the two on one hall. The old rooms are completely different then the new rooms (we saw both). Our experiences below are based on the new rooms: Pros: Location- very close to Forum, Coll., Palatine and other ruins as well as Capitoline Museums. Longer walk to more touristy areas like Campo di Fiori, but even Vatican (furthest walk) is only 20 minutes or 10-15 by metro. New rooms- nothing like a brand new, modern room! Ultra clean and fresh. Service- other than some miscommunication before we arrived, the staff were very willing to do whatever was necessary to ensure our stay was a happy one. Very helpful. Cons: Rooms- while the rooms in the new building are ultra new, some were not designed well. One shower flooded the bathroom (we had to move rooms) and that same room felt very small based on design (setup, layout, window location, etc). Also, there are still some rough edges, like a missing ceiling panel in one room (but not others), bedroom mirror and refrig missing on another, etc. Some of this is a work-in-progress and I expect will be corrected in time. Some, such as the design, won't. But this would be a very minor detraction over all. Breakfast- adequate and with a very nice location on roof, but for a four-star hotel I would expect more variety and better croissants. We stayed at many hotels last month in Italy, including one other four star and many three stars and Richmond's breakfast low on the list. Parking- there is none. Certainly not a problem if you arrive/leave by cab, but if you were driving in and then returning the car, it was difficult. There is a narrow driveway between restaurants that happened to be open, but otherwise you would have to park on a very busy street where no parking is really allowed. This is actually rather typical for Rome, except we were led to believe the location was fine for parking and unloading. Again, rather minor issue if you are aware before arriving.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cdont believe the pictures\u201d", "Author": "cd2523", "ReviewID": "UR42737760", "Content": "So the hotel is ok, but the ad photos have been taken with good lighting and angles.

The breakfast terrace is lovely, although with a hideous statue made I think of paper mache. Location wise this place is perfect and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly.

Great value for money in a city with very expensive hotels. Although we used Booking.com to reserve the room, we emailed to confirm and got some wonderful advice from Gemma at reception. She was such a help to us -- arranging for our pick-up at the airport, restaurant reservations, taxis, etc! We looked forward to breakfast each day on the terrace which has a great view! All the normal continental breakfast items were available -- including fresh croissants and fruit (along with eggs that could be added for a bit extra $). It was a great start to the day!

I emailed them before I flew over after having read on this site that their single room may be too tiny for me and hope they could upgrade me if they were not too busy. Being their off season, well, to my surprise I was upgraded without paying any extra. Room and bathroom were very clean albeit peely wall paper could be improve. Pictures of the room, the scene in front of my room (303) and Gemma are all being attached.

If you are sensitive to traffic noise there are even ear plugs supplied, being at the centre of all the historical site these was expected.

There is a tiny fridge with refreshments available, a bottle opener but no cock screw, have to ask for one to open my bottle of wine. Plug adapter to top up my camera battery was luckily also available. A wall safe and flat screen sky TV sum up the facilities of the room.

Rooms were very clean! Staff was excellent... Fabio at the front desk was very nice!!! Great location, a block away from the colleseum and roman forum right across the street. Free continental breakfast on the rooftop was SWEET... fresh fruit, buns, cheese, meat, pound cake, cereal! Nice the hotel washroom provided body wash and shampoo too!", "Date": "November 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trento", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced\u201d", "Author": "ioio", "ReviewID": "UR6011288", "Content": "Prices are too high for 2 stars and such service. Breakfast was good, but there is no restaurant in the hotel. The minibar in the room was nearly empty and when we asked if it's possible to order another coca-cola in our room, the answer was \"no, sorry\". Promised wireless internet didn't work, also air condition works in a very particular way.. By the way, in the shower I found little black bugs, that is really the most horrible. Doubtfully would recomend this hotel for someone.. and for sure will never come back there again. There is only one plus - really good central location, but there are a lot of other hotels around, it's better to choose something else.", "Date": "October 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cLoved The Richmond\u201d", "Author": "dunmore2", "ReviewID": "UR5508524", "Content": "We enjoyed this delightful hotel for 2 nights in July. The staff was friendly and helpful. Their English was fluent and they answered our many questions from shoe shopping to getting us a taxi. The breakfast was better than most in Italy, croissants, fruit, cheese, cereal, yogurt, cold meat ,fresh juices and the best view in the whole city. The room was spacious with very good quality bed linens. We will stay here again for all of the above reasons plus the location is perfect. The pizza place just out the front door is also recommended by us.

Helpful, friendly, courteous, pleasant, etc, etc. Rooms basic but spotless. Loads of reasonably priced and excellent restaurants, trattoria, etc just outside the front door. Breakfast very good and with lovely view of Roman Forum and Basilica of Maxentius. We had a fabulous visit - BUT - they almost ruined it all on the way home! We requested a taxi to take us to the airport (in the same way we had requested several taxis during our stay). The young man on reception did not request the same taxi firm as had been hired before, but a private cab. The lady driver refused to give us a price for the journey and claimed she did not understand our attempts to ask for a price, which soon changed once we arrived at the airport... Journey cost us nearly DOUBLE our journey to the hotel.

I arrived at the hotel with my wife and two teenage sons after just being scammed by a Rome taxi out of about 60 Euros. I mentioned this to Rosa while checking in and she asked if I had the number of the taxi, which I did. A few hours later, I learned that Rosa had tracked down the driver. The next day, the driver came to the hotel and returned the 60 Euro he owed me plus the cost of the cab ride. Rosa is a gem. The hotel itself is in a very great location (next to the Roman Forum and a block from the Coliseum) and my room (102) was clean, quiet and comfortable for the four of us. The breakfast was very good and the rooftop location was a real treat.
