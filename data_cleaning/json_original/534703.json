The location is excellent, near Taksim square with busy nightlife and not far from the Old Town by metro/tram. The room was well-equipped with coffee making facilities, bathrobe and option to select a pillow of choice. Daily newspaper was provided and the internet (wi-fi) worked well. An iron/board might make a nice addition. The room air conditioning was set to too hot and we had no way of changing it, after opening a window it was a bit noisy but in the 7th floor it was OK. Breakfast is served in a lovely top floor restaurant with a terrace and great view and selection is excellent, with lovely Turkish cheese and a healthy options table as well. The spa was a bit disappointing - does not offer much intimacy when you use the sauna or steam bath and there was only one shower in operation. To use the swimming pool you need a cap, a big minus - they sell it at a high price.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cNot my first choice in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "vituzzo", "ReviewID": "UR128128649", "Content": "I stayed in the Point hotel at the end of March for business for the first time and I have to say that I was expecting a better accommodation. Nothing to complain with the service, particularly on checking in and checking out. What really disappointed me was my room; maybe I have just been unlucky. I got a room on the first floor with just a small window that was pretty useless and I had to keep the lights on all the time. Furthermore the room was quite small, L shaped, and quite uncomfortable. The bathroom has seen better times and needed some maintenance. All was working, but looked old and a bit worn out. The amenities were quite poor compared to other, cheaper, hotels in Taksim. Finally I found the room very noisy and I had a very bad night due to the noise coming from the corridor. Overall I found the room quite below the standards I was expecting. I didn't have the opportunity to use the other hotels facilities, so I cannot comment.

Great location, just 3 minutes walk from Taksim Square. You then have the choice of either walking downhill down the main shopping street (which pretty much takes you anywhere north of the Galata Bridge that you want to go...Or take a short funicular ride down the hill (located in Taksim Square) and jump onto the great tram system to hit all the tourist spots on the other side of the bridge. Also 2 minutes walk from the Havas airport shuttle bus stop which was very convenient. Feels very safe even walking home very late at night. There are a few restaurants close by but beware the tourist traps \u00e2\u20ac\u201c venture a little further instead (refer to Lonely Planet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we tried a few great places). Also check the kebab places where S\u00c4\u00b1raselviler Caddesi meets Taksim Square \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great for quick bite. As for the hotel itself, our room was immaculately clean (even the bathroom) and the staff were fantastic. We stayed in a Deluxe (which is the standard) room. The room was a great size, enough for a huge (we think it was super king) bed, a single seater arm chair with foot rest and desk with chair along the window and STILL room to spare. TV, minibar and tea/coffee making facilities all provided. We had a small gift waiting for us on arrival along with two bottles of water and two packets of nuts which we received again each day we stayed. Free wi-fi was also provided and was quick enough and password provided in room. Breakfast was also great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much variety and the almost uninterrupted views over Istanbul were great. Hotel also has a lovely bar in the lobby for beer, wine and complementary snacks. Also worth checking out the pool, sauna and steam room downstairs. Quiet, calm and lovely.

At the time of writing this review I have stayed at two medium class business hotels in Taksim, Istanbul, and this I would argue is the slightly better one of them. Having said that, the hotel is anynomous and as such quite boring. Personal like a train station. Also beware that there are rouge 'shoepolishers' on way to the walk to the ICC. They look like tramps and try attract the attention of tourists by seemingly accidentally dropping one of their shoe polish tools on the street. Whatever you do - do NOT attempt to help. If you do that they will want to polish your shoes ;as a thankful gesture' only to then aggressively demand ridiculous amounts of money for the 'service'. This leaves a bitter aftertaste - you feel robbed - and the fact that these tramps (another gorilla tramp; same trick) were still outside the hotel 8 months after my first visit to Taksim just shows that the Istanbul hotels do not care too much about their tourists. If I ever have to go back to the ICC I will insist to stay at the Hilton next door to ICC. Whatever it costs it will be worth the difference.

The Point Hotel is very conveniently located just a few hundred yards from Taksim Square and almost directly across teh street from the Geziparki exit from Taksim Metro station. Getting back to Maslak is a 15 minute Metro ride at a cost of just 3TL (67p!). The hotel staff are excellent and provide a warm, friendly and efficient welcome. As a business user, you are also greeted with a package that includes free wifi, 2 bottles of water in your room each day, free pressing of a shirt and trousers each day, access to the swimming pool and spa area and free newspaper etc. The only slight downside is that the fitness room is currently being refurbished so is downgraded to a very small room with one bike, one treadmill and an inclined bench. The hotel also boasts a bar, a cafe area and two restaurants - one of which serves well prepared Japanese fare. Prices are easily below what you would expect to pay in London with a fairly good bottle of wine costing just over \u00c2\u00a320. With the Taksim area just outside the door however, there is plenty of choice. My 7th room floor was well appointed with flat screen TV, two good sized beds (pretty much two doubles), a desk area and a good sized bathroom - where the only real disappointment was found - the shower was not much better than a dribble although teh water was nicely hot.

The bathroom was clean and innovatively done up. We used the buffet at coffee shop for lunch and breakfast - nice spread and good quality food.

There were nice touches e.g. free internet usage, slippers, dressing gowns, chocolates on your pillow. Breakfast was great with a good variety and great views. We also had excellent service throughout our stay and found all the staff very attentive. The hotel is a good walk from the old town, but very near to the main shopping/eating area which was very lively and we thought was great.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cvery good choice\u201d", "Author": "diakos", "ReviewID": "UR10030938", "Content": "I stayed at Point a four months ago on a business trip to Istanbul and was very pleased with my choice.
