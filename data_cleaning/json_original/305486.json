Another reason was, I am travelling with my husband and kids of 3 and 5 yo, and this is one of the few hotels in booking.com who stated \"all children under 12 are free\" I didn't want to pay extra bed for our kids. It cost SGD 20 (incl tips) from the airport to this hotel. When we entered the hotel, yes there was an aromatherapy smell, which we get used to it on the next day. I asked to get the highest floor for our superrior room, and the hotel staff gave us room number 1128. The room has just been re-painted, which made it look fresh. There are stained on the carpets, but not too many. The furniture looks so 80's but the LCD tv and also HBO, kids channel, made up the tired look of the furniture. It also has a great view to the city. The room is spacious for the four of us. We paid 350 sgd (excl tax) for our 2 nights stay for our superior room, incl breakfast and free internet. The free wifi is amazingly fast. The bathroom was ok. And we get free newspaper every morning. Breakfast was at the Indian resto on the 5th floor, it was very basic, and the resto looks very old. We enjoyed the pool, it was a very clean pool. We didn't regret staying at this hotel at all, it is easy to access with bus and MRT. Bus stop \"Victoria Street\" are just outside the hotel with the tourist route such as: bus 133 to suntec, bus 145 to vivo city, bus 130 to little india, bus 175 from Lucky Plaza Orchard. From bus stop \"North Bridge Complex\" take bus 7 to Orchard. The SEX bus from and to the zoo stops at the hotel.

We arrived at 8 am at the hotel well before the check-in time, staff was very accommodating and gave us a room straight away as we were travelling with an Infant. We got a 6 hour sleep in as we were knackered after a long haul flight from Auckland. When we finally got a bit charged up, we were horrified to see the condition of our standard room. Stains all over the carpets, curtains etc. Ripped wallpapers, all furniture severely scratched and very very run down in general. Reception informed us that is the general condition of all standard rooms and perhaps we be more comfortable in a club room at cost of extra $150 for 2 nights. The club room is exactly same room on a higher level with slightly less run-down furniture. On the 2nd night the toilet flush decided to get stuck and kept flushing non-stop. We complained to front desk that this needs to be fixed immediately as our infant daughter is fast asleep and it be chaos if she be woken from her deep sleep. After about 25 minute a maintenance person came up to check the situation who was warned to try not make too much noise. His staff walkie talkie kept going off constantly and he would constantly drop his tool bag etc on the bathroom floor. After much mucking for about 20min they finally got the flush semi-fixed as it would still get stuck on occasion. All this commotion finally woke our daughter up and she was very very cranky and would not sleep till 3am after crying for 3 hours straight. This is simply appalling for a supposedly 4 star hotel part of a reputable chain of hotels. The price of $250 per night we ended up paying after the upgrade is simply a rip off and way to expensive for level of amenities and general state of the rooms.

There was no time to do proper research on available hotels. Having stayed at Landmark in Bangkok, we (wrongly) assumed that it will be of the same ilk. Location \u2013 This was by far the only redeeming factor of staying at this hotel as also stated by previous reviewers. It is across the street from \u2018Arab Street\u2019 which was really fun visiting. Access to all major areas in the city is very easy whether by taxi or MRT. Reception \u2013 Physically tired looking. Staff was efficient on check-in. Room \u2013 As said in so many other reviews \u2013 this place is in SERIOUS need of renovation. What a nightmare! It is so tired looking and tacky it is scary. Our room was extremely noisy and we found it difficult to sleep. Part of the problem is the big gap between the door and the floor which means noise that is already amplified in the confined space of the hallway, comes flooding through. Bathrooms \u2013 The plumbing was so noisy, I thought people were drilling directly above us. Mildew was everywhere \u2013 especially between badly laid tiles. Furnishings \u2013 I doubt a secondhand store will look at buying this stuff. It really is in bad shape. The carpet was so badly stained; we were scared to walk around barefoot, because it just looks dirty! We decided to only return to the room after dark when things at least look less run-down. Service \u2013 What service?? Housekeeping knocks on the door despite a \u2018Do not Disturb\u2019 sign and then yells down the passage \u2013 \u2018This room has a Do not Disturb\u2019. Staff at reception could not even tell us whether to turn left or right in front of the hotel to get to Arab Street! I was waiting to check out with reception staff \u2018faffing\u2019 around instead of helping. The hotel manager happened to pass by and got them to help me. Meals \u2013 We had NO desire to even try. Considering the state of the rooms which are in the public eyes, I fear to think what the kitchens look like. Business Services \u2013 We did not make use of this. S$6 for 30 minutes of internet time. It is much better to pay that for a coffee at one of the many cafes and have unlimited internet. General \u2013 It has been a while since I paid good money for such a bad experience. I understand that Singapore is never cheap, but this was way too expensive for what is on offer.

The staff can be a bit over zealous in clearing the tables which is not really a complaint but one time I had collected my food, put it on the table, went to get a spoon and when I returned it had gone! The pool area was very welcome after a day's sightseeing but as previous reviews have pointed out this area is often used in the evenings for weddings etc so, although no one actually says anything, you do feel that you should leave the area as no one wants someone wandering through their celebrations in their swimming costume!

This is very funny hotel with respect to a nornal common traveller , as well as to a high-end traveller who is looking for class & perfection . I will summarise my funniest experiance which i have got in this hotel :- 1. Like many other guys , my day start with reading newspaper with a cup of tea . But i could not get any newspaper from hotel . When i enquired on the first day , i got very stupid response from room service as \" They provide news paper only to the guests who book their rooms dirctly with them . Since i had booked my room through travel agent , i was not supposed to get any news paper \" . Further , they advised me to purchase the newspaper from 7/11 shop which is across the road . The lady at reception also duly informed me that the newspaper costs only 90 cents , so i should purchase one , if i am not able to survive without it , and she hanged up the phone afterwards . Needless to say , i purchased the newspaper everyday afterwards. 2. This is probably the only hotel in the world where the calls to reception , room service , and even calls to duty manager's number gets un-answered . Believe me , they simply do not pick up the phone at all to listen to the customer !! ......What an attitude in hospitality industry ! 3. There is no free internet connection provided to the guests . 4. There are four lifts in the hotel , but they are not synchronised . So at times when you push the call button , all four lifts will come to your floor simultenously , and at times , none will come at all . If you have to attend some event or tour package , pls add minimum 20 minutes in your waiting time , for the lift see-saw game . 5. There is a indian restaurent at 5th floor & a chinese restaurent at 3rd floor , but none of them are attached with the hotel . So , if you order anything for room service ( And if you are lucky enough that your phone call is answered ) , than you have to pay additiponal charges . 6. The Breakfast & lunch menu is same everyday . Either there is no intensional veriation by management , or their sheff simply doesn't know how to cook other things . 7. The rooms and interior decorations are pathetic . And the attached bathroom is too small. The carpet gives the feeling of the era of 1700 B.C. , when carpets were first invented ! 8. People at reception behave as if they are giving alms to customer . No Smile , No Sorry , No Thanx kind of at all . Very uncultured staff , i must say !! Few Good Things :- 1. Despite all issues , quality & taste of food was good in both restaruents . 2. Hotel is centrally located 3. Mr. Ravi , who is the owner of 7/11 Shop across the rood is very nice & helpful man . He is unknowlingly helping this pathetic hotel , by helping the customers who manage to reach him . All the points mentioned above are based on my very recent personal experiance .

This hotel is decently priced (for Singapore) but shows signs of a hotel past its prime. The room/furniture/fixtures & fittings have definitely seen better days. The carpet was worn, the wood of the door frames cracked and the d\u00e9cor dated. The vanity in the bathroom had water stains around the tap which was a result of poor maintenance \u2013 the tap leaked when turned on. The plumbing of the building must have been old because an unpleasant smell would emanate from the bathroom drains after using hot water. There were also a few issues that occurred during our stay. We booked through an online travel service, and the package included free wifi. The hotel had not recorded this so we had to sort this out with the hotel staff, who were quick to resolve the issue. The room did not have a hotel services guide, which I like to have so I know what the charges are for using hotel amenities. I called the front desk and housekeeping five times to have a book brought up to my room. On one occasion a staff member brought up a walking guide for the area, and on another occasion a menu which consisted of a few pieces of paper stapled together. On the remaining occasions, the staff just failed to deliver.I gave up in the end and came to the conclusion that a services guide did not exist \u2013 I would have liked to have been told that in the first place so that I did not have to keep following it up. The kettle in the room smelled like coffee (as if a previous occupant had used the kettle to actually brew the beverage), so we asked for a new kettle. The replacement kettle that was brought up was actually broken. The next call I made, I had to specify that I did not want a kettle that smelled or that was not broken.

I could have made better use of my time, enjoying the breakfast. However, the so-called 'wide variety' of buffet spread at the cafe in the lobby has limited food. I could list the food they have which is a maximum of 10 cooked food items eg plain congee, beef sausage, scrambled eggs, vegetarian noodles, ham, potato wedges, fried spring rolls, pancake, baked beans and an egg station. We booked an executive club room and could have enjoyed our breakfast in the lounge. However, they have only 6 cooked food items which took them a long time to replenish as there were a number of guests. Rooms: Before making our reservation, we called the hotel to make sure they have smoking executive club rooms. The staff on duty told us they do have smoking executive club rooms and hence we made the booking. Upon check in, we were given a smoking room on the 19th floor, one level above the executive lounge, which is common in many hotels. We did not suspect anything was wrong then. When we reached the room, boy did we get a shock! The room has a horrible stench. My husband who is a smoker cannot even stand the stench! The room has a 2-panel window and the room was extremely dim! The room was also rather run-down. We had asked the staff over the phone the night before and they told us that their guests are usually satisfied when they upgrade to the executive club rooms and that these rooms are the newer ones. However, the room before our eyes then definitely looked old and run-down. We immediately approach the front desk again to ask for a change of rooms. It was then we learnt that the 19th floor rooms aren't executive club rooms. They are deluxe rooms! The lady at the front desk told us that for guests requesting for smoking executive club rooms, they will just put them in the smoking deluxe rooms and change the amenities to that of the executive club room. We were appalled as such acts are definitle dishonest! We were then given a non-smoking room at the 18th floor which was brighter and slightly newer. However, it was definitely inconvenient for my husband. The room wasn't well-cleaned as there were dirt and stains left by the previous occupant on the bedside table. We were also told by the staff that this room comes with a standing shower only. We made do with that as long as the room is better than the previous room. However, when we saw the toilet, we laughed at the size of it. It was so small, that you'll need to stand aside in order to close the door and then get to the small standing shower. Service: Check in was alright. I even told my husband that the service here seems to make up for the not-up-to-Mark rooms. I was too quick to make that remark and I take my words back. One of the executive club lounge lady who was on night shift was excellent. She was very professional and was always smiling no matter how busy she was. For that, I give her my applause. However, the next morning, when we had our pathetic breakfast, the staff there seemed like she had a bad morning. Not only she didn't smile at us, when my husband asked her about the breakfast, she didn't even look at him and carried on with what she was doing! My husband and I were disgusted by her acts! We then personally go to the front desk to ask for the check out time as our room package comes with a complimentary late check-out but were not told of the time upon check-in. To our astonishment, the front desk lady and another gentleman told us check out for us is at 12pm after checking their system. My husband then asked what is the usual check out time if the late check out is at 12pm for us. I showed them my confirmation email which stated very clearly my entitlements. The gentleman then said the latest they can give us is at 2pm. We were put off by what we heard because it was as if we asked for it and not our entitlement. The gentleman added that he couldn't give us any later than 2h after 12pm as they will then have to charge us! What he said shows very clearly that he does not have a good understanding of what the hotel offers to the guests. We asked to speak with the manager and were taken aback when that gentleman told is that he is the manager! Location: Good for tourists who want a central location (near the MRT) without paying exorbitant prices. It isn't directly opposite Bugis Junction as shown in the map. It is opposite Raffles hospital and you will have to walk past the hospital to get to Bugis Junction which is 5+ minutes away.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "India", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Nice Location\u201d", "Author": "BCooper123", "ReviewID": "UR118053534", "Content": "Its a nice hotel near Bugis MRT and Arab Street.

Another plus point on location is that it is just a couple of minutes walk away from Bugis station. Other wise the hotel seemed just an average one. Although It is part of the village theme of hotels in Singapore this hotel did not exhibit any special village theme or preservation of traditional themes or arts of Singapore in its premises. There is hardly any space at the main entrance of this hotel. The lobby is at the third floor and the Indian restaurant on the fifth floor and lifrs were not efficient. The room is quite small and was a bit stale. Being a family of four (2 aadults + 2 kids) with the extra bed in place , the room became quite cramped. Being vegetarians, we went only to the Indian restaurant. I would say it is just about an average restaurant. the food quality was Ok. The reaturant desperately needed cleanliness measures and the staff a training on it. The staff was always in a hurry and did not have time even to respond to your query (except the manager at the billing counter who took all the time in the world to print the bill). They also have tables outside the restaurant next to the pool but staff attention is near zero at those tables. We were waiting for eternity for the order to be placed.

The hotel is a little older and is in real need of both some renovation and some organization. My room came with Wi-Fi and breakfast but the Wi-Fi did not work for the first three days and despite numerous phone calls could never be brought into operation with the login that was given, in the end the telephone support engineer just gave up and issued a completely different login that worked for the last three days of my stay, however despite five bars of signal strength the connection speeds were so slow as to make the connection really quite useless for anything but the simplest surfing. There were two breakfast areas one normal and one with an Indian theme. The normal breakfast area was in the Chinese restaurant on the same level as reception. The area was so crowded on the occasions I tried to have breakfast there that the tables were all being shared with strangers, also the staff seemed to have an aversion to cleaning the tables and the atmosphere was nonexistent. The Indian version on the 5th floor was better on the first occasion that I tried it with a variety of tasty Indian style breakfast dishes but on the second occasion the two coach parties that were squashed in made it almost as bad at the main breakfast venue. I tried to go the in house Indian Restaurant on one evening and after waiting for about five minutes by the please wait to be seated desk was told that normal restaurant food would not be served there but on the sixth floor instead, no reason was given for this. I went up to the sixth floor only to find a sort of buffet in the corridor leading to some other desolate rooms, I asked the girl who ran up to me if this was supposed to be a restaurant and she confirmed that in her opinion it was however as I was of a different opinion I went elsewhere that night. My room had very dirty carpet and furniture that was falling quite literally to pieces. The bed was extremely hard and the room was very loud when anyone was in the corridor or the room next door due to the connecting door that let all the noise through. It was necessary to prop a chair against the doors to the wardrobe as it contained an automatic light that would not go out without significant pressure being applied to the door. There were two escalators up from the entrance to the 3rd floor reception and in all the time I was there only the up escalator was working. The elevators which were the alternative seemed to have a programming that maximized the wait time which was truly atrocious on the weekend due to the number of people arriving, leaving and trying to access the restaurants. I had to wait 15 minutes before I could get into one to go up to my room only to find that yet again the magnetic strip on my room key did not work in the access slot which was necessary to be activated before you could select your floor. In total I got through five keys in three days before I finally got one that worked. I am quite used to these sort of key and am aware that they should be kept away from cell phones and other cards so this was not the problem. I believe that they are using the cards to often before replacing them and this would fit into the rest of the hotels style. You might ask why I did not try to change my room, well I looked at other room which were open for cleaning and they all seemed to be about the same. I know this all sounds a bit extreme and I do try to be fair in my reviews but this hotel is really that bad and I cannot recommend it in any way.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel in Bugis\u201d", "Author": "Gixxerscott", "ReviewID": "UR116443053", "Content": "When I arrived the room I was assigned had two beds, even though the front desk had said it was a queen.

Last MRT leaves from Changi just before midnight and from Bugis to Changi airport, the last is at 1129 while first is at 0605am. Hardly 45 minutes. Bugis street and Bugis junction, the fav hotspots for cheap shopping are just 400 meters away. Orchard street/ Marina bay is just 10 minutes away. Rooms: I happen to stay on 13th fllor with pool/ bay view (twin beds) and 15th floor (king size bed) with city view. Later room was big but again my personal choice, go in for pool/ bay view. Interconnected rooms are available but those make noise at night :), pls be aware not to give hints to your neighbour. Wifi access available at S$5 for 30 minutes. The Hotel: Well, it will be wrong to stay that it is a hotel because it seems more like a self serviced apartment where you check in and forget you are staying in hotel because you cannot command service. It is a pure 3 star hotel with swimming pool and gym as add on available with your room Service: \"Dont expect anything\". Well, I booked a king size but told upon checking that only twin beds are available. Dey did joined the bed but you know the diff betwene the two beds keeps you uncomfortable. However next day they shifted me to a room with king size bed. Almost 5-6 times, I would have called up housekeeping or reception but no one picks up the phone esp during morning hours. If they do pick up, dont expect them to react. I asked them to refill tea bags and reminded almost 3 times every 30 minutes but no one turned up. Even called up duty manager (well hard to call him, u hv to find him) but no action. They refilled it at their own convenience when I was out and usual housekeeping person came to clean my room. Carpet is age old and they still have CTV in the rooms :(. No microwave in the room. Out of my total stay of 3 nights, I got newspaper only two times. Word of caution: Housekeeping incl laundry people have dis habit that they will ring the door bell and use the master key to force open the door.

I had called the hotel and they had said all rooms are refurbished. This isnt the case, it seems. However, the room we got met all our expectations, so treat this just as advance information. - website proclaims free service to resort world sentosa. When i tried to book it, they said they had only 6 seats per day per shuttle. obviously this came as a surprise. I felt that the website statement is misleading. Anyone travelling in a group of 3-4 people has hardly a chance to avail this service, specially on late check ins, since the hotel also didnt book this in advance on phone.

The hotel is frequented by tourists from around the world, especially from India. The reception area looks impressive so does the hotel itself from the outside. ----------------------------- SERVICE: C. My room was always made up relatively late, i.e., in the afternoon, usually past 4 PM. So when I got back to my hotel room at 3 PM one day I found that the cleaning personnel had not yet cleaned my room. I also had a problem with the shower which only had cold water running. I told front desk about this problem on Sunday morning but by Sunday afternoon, when I got back, nothing was done. So I complained to one of the cleaning ladies that I saw on the hotel floor and she promised to get someone from housekeeping to fix the problem. Some minutes later actually someone came but he was unable to fix the shower. He said he needed to call a plumber but he would only come the next day, since it was impossible to get one on a Sunday afternoon. Anyway, the next day the problem was fixed. ------------------------------ ROOMS: B+. Relatively large rooms for a city hotel, enough space in my opinion. The bed was comfortable. Overall it was a clean looking room, possibly recently refurbished. You can have relatively fast Wifi access in your room. You have to buy a ticket at reception. I forgot how much it exactly cost but I do remember that it was expensive. ------------------------------- SWIMMING POOL: B. Seems, not many people use it. The pool bar was open from afternoon onwards. I am not sure, if they clean the pool every day. The pool chairs were not too comfortable in my opinion. ------------------------------ BREAKFAST: C. There are two breakfast restaurants: One for Indian breakfast and one where you get standard Western breakfast. I only ate once at the breakfast room for Western food and unfortunately the food wasn\u2019t very good, the friendliness of the service personnel was so so and it was also too expensive (forgot the exact amount). After that bad experience I went for breakfast to one of the local eating places nearby. There\u2019s a hospital around the corner with a great cafeteria. I know, this doesn\u2019t sound too inviting but it actually was a great place! Apart from some medical personnel that were there too it didn\u2019t have the feel of a hospital restaurant at all! Try it! -------------------------------- LOCATION: A-. Very good because it was just one block away from Bugis MRT (subway) station with a line that runs directly to the airport and the city center. So in essence you are just a 5 minute ride away from the shopping and entertainment zones of Singapore. Also, the hotel is located close to the nice Arab quarter with shops and restaurants. --------------------------------- TO SUM IT UP: I would grade it as a C+ hotel. It is a typical three star tourist hotel. Don\u2019t expect too much in terms of service. It is a good place if you want to explore Singapore for a couple of days. Would I stay there again? If I could find a very good (!) deal on the internet: maybe, but I would certainly look for better alternatives as well although I know it is difficult to find a good hotel at a reasonable price in this great city.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hk", "Title": "\u201cGreat View and Service at the Executive Floor\u201d", "Author": "NamSheeTsim", "ReviewID": "UR68027658", "Content": "Stayed 4 days at the executive floor subscribed as a promotion package with complimentary airport transfers. The room is really VERY big. The furnitures are a bit old (sofa and table in the sitting room are of old style), but in good condition and clean. Bed is very big and very comfortable. There are internet connections in both the bedroom and the sitting room, transmission is fast. I moved from the Swissotel the Stamford to this hotel, the initial intention was for cheaper accommodation during my stay in Singapore. The feeling is entirely different from the two hotels. Swissotel is very busy (and more expansive), that giant building depends on ultra-fast lifts to transport guests vertically, the surrounding malls are flooded with people and there is an underground station just next to the hotel, gave the feeling of too much like home, but very convenient, especially if one need to go to the Suntec Convention Centre. I walked from Swissotel to the Village Landmark Hotel (previously called Golden Landmark Hotel) along the North Bridge Road in a late afternoon, made me feel more like a tourist. The transition from Buggis Street area to the Village Landmark Hotel is especially interesting. There are some very colonial building near the Raffles Hotel, then some local buildings, then the Buggis Shopping Mall, after a short section of construction, everything quieted down along the Raffles Hospital, then arrived the Little India and the Arab Street area. The tone changed significantly, with the Mosque and the very local shops along the Arab Street sharply contrasting the modern development of Singapore. The reception at Village Landmark is manned with limited number of staff, timing for check-out is important if one is in a hurry to the airport. We needed to take the 8 am flight and had to depart the hotel at around 5:30. The complimentary van transport was well arranged. The lounge staff (Mr. Adam) at the executive level knew about our plan and he voluntarily offered to arrange some packed breakfast for us! The view from my room in Landmark Village was towards the sea, the green patch of meadow and the orange rooftops at the Little India area with the busy roads far away gave a quieter picture than the view I got from the Swissotel, which was very busy with all the cars and highways close to the Cultural Centre though the view of the new Sands Casino was very impressive especially at night and the Merlion was actually in view. But we could see the Skywheel from the Landmark Village and the Parkview Square's spectacular architecture - reminded me of the film 'Star War'. We have breakfast at the executive lounge at the same level for breakfast. Very quite and comfortable. Choice of food may be less than that served at the American Breakfast floor, but we liked the quietness at the lounge, and they serve Nepresso coffee! Probably a great proportion of guests are Indians thus there is the Indian Breakfast served at another floor. From 6 pm to 8 pm free drinks and snacks are offered at the executive lounge to executive floor guests and we enjoyed some very good unwinding before going out for dinner. The beer glasses are also chilled in the fridge. I was a bit worried about the water pressure and water temperature for bathing as revealed by earlier discussants in this link. But both are very good in my room. We have not tried the swimming pool nor the restaurant.

We were located on the 17th, and 18th floors (19 floors total)... and for most parts all renovation work has been completed.. While we were there, they were painting the stairwells, so when they painted those on or levels, the area smelled badly for a couple of days. But that faded. Location IS this hotel's best attribute... Less than 2 blocks from the Bugis train station, getting there is a short and easy walk even when carrying heavy items. It's also close to some majir shopping centers, and close to Bugis Village. It's also acrosst the street from the Sultan Mosque, which is a real hub of activity, and an archictectural beauty. It's close to Little India, and the Arab sector. Again.. Location IS this hotel's best attribute... The area nearby is extremely safe... Be prepared.. the Mall located on the first few floors of this building are NOT for shopping... There are an inordinate number of travel agents located there, but otherwise, most shops are non-descript, open by appointment only, geared to selling mostly to the Indian visitors... it is not a place where you'll spend a lot of time at.. it's vacant, and one quick walk through is all you'll ever spend there. As for the hotel itself. Clean.. yes.. relatively quiet... rooms are a bit small... TV.. few channels... The 18th floor housekeeping staff is GREAT.. The restaurants downstairs (3rd floor and 5th floor) are nice, but nothing special. Extremely expensive to eat at... and the food is not that great... nothing special.. I can't immagine anyone walking in off the street, and eating there... It really is geaed to the hotel customer, who is traveling on an expense account. The front desk personnel seem to want to be helpful, but are also limited in what they can do.. they are always short staffed, so expect long waits there. Hot water to the room is always questionable... You cannot take a shower - long or short, without having the water temperature fluctuate... that is one constant.. 1 minute or 20 minutes... water temperature is always all over the place. You have no control. Room air conditioning.. there is no middle ground... too cold, or too hot.... we were never an\\ble to set the thermostat to a nice temperature, and maintain the temperature.. so it was too cold all the time.... The pool on the 5th floor is nice enough. There is often some celebration of some sort there that uses the immediate area.. so we found the we were restricted from using it when we wanted to use it. Mornings is usually available, but not evenings... The 5th floor is constantly used by Indian groups.. There is a KTV lounge on the 3rd floor, but beer there is very expensive at S$10.00 per glass... that is uncalled for... The Asian singers are pretty and entertaining... but don't make up for the expensive prices. That's probably why the place is usually vacant. For our rooms, the Internet was free. Ask for it to be free if they try to charge you. It is wired, and somewhat slow. Ethernet cables are provided. You will need power adatpers if you are not from the region. S$2.00 is the most you should pay for this at local stores. There is underground parking. I did not use it.

The shower head leaked so much there was hardly any water coming out of it as it all ran down the hose. The carpets were disgusting!

There were also small bugs running all over the place - including the bathroom. During the evening there was an Indian birthday party taking place by the hotel pool. It was absolutely stunning to see but the music and noise was so loud the floor was shaking. I tried for over 30 miutes to contact reception with no luck so had to go down to find out when the noise would stop. The receptioinst apologised and said it would finish at 11pm sharp, and it did. We went down for breakfast in the morning and wished we hadn't! It was awful. The room was so small and cramped and the table was dirty from the previous guests.

I explained that I wanted to pay extra for better rooms but I was refused again. When I pressed for an explanation I was told that children were not allowed into the Executive Lounge because children are loud, rude and misbehave. I found this rather insulting as I do try to bring up my children well! In fact the children were sitting quietly and patiently by the front desk. It took well over an hour to check in as the front desk wanted my husband to check in for me but as he was in a business meeting he was unavailable. The receptionist also initially refused my offer of my own passport or credit card details to help speed things up. When we were finally allocated our rooms they were dirty and stank of smoke. When I complained about the state of the rooms it took another long wait for us to be moved. I must emphasise that I was polite throughout but I cannot say the same for the staff who kept disappearing into a small room behind the front desk.The new rooms were not much better but at this point I just gave up. I could continue complaining - the squashed cockroach by the poolside, the surly porters and waiters.

A paper was delivered every morning and sometimes had a little piece of paper telling you what the weather was going to be like. If you had booked an executive room you get breakfast included in the price and you can choose whether you eat your breakfast in the executive lounge or the restaurant at the hotel. We chose the restaurant as we enjoyed it so much the first morning. There was a lot of choice - cereal, cakes, pastries, toast, rolls, cooked breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausages, hash browns, tomatoes, baked beans, mushrooms), fruit and even an omelette station where you chose what you wanted in your omelette and it was cooked there and then. The hotel was very clean, we were impressed with how clean Singapore is as a whole. The staff couldnt do enough for us and were always asking if we needed help with anything. We had to check out of the hotel by midday and our flight wasnt until 10pm that evening so we were a bit worried about our luggage but the hotel took it for us and put it in their luggage room for no extra charge. The location of the hotel is good as its right near the MRT. There is a market down the road from the hotel and also some eateries. You also have the usual McDonalds round the corner and a Burger King! Raffles Hotel isnt far and there are some museums and galleries to visit nearby. If we ever wanted to go anywhere though we used the MRT, i couldnt recommend it enough. If you buy a travel card for 30$ (about \u00a315) you get $10 worth of travel and the card is worth $5 which you can get back when you are finished with it. The $10 of travel lasted us 2 full days and we went everywhere!", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cGreat value; great location\u201d", "Author": "HowellerCornwall", "ReviewID": "UR27625123", "Content": "Stayed here for three nights end of March.

The bed was equivalent to sleeping on a concrete floor, and the pillows were even worse. Although, the hotel is in a great location it is not worth the stay at Golden Landmark. What I did not know about Singapore was the fact that the hotels are cheaper closer to the airport and the train system in Singapor is quite efficient and always on time. The price to commute from the airport to the city is only $2 Singapore Dollars.

We selected this hotel because it was very well located to the MRT station (5 minute walk), Bugis Junction and markets, and because it was reasonably priced. The entrance to the hotel was a bit of a treasure hunt because it was not located on either of the two main streets, but rather down the quiet side street. The foyer was also located upstairs on level 3, which we could reach by elevator or escalator. I should mention that even though the hotel has four elevators, it was still sometimes a long wait for a lift. It also didn't help that the doors only stay open for a very very short period of time, so if you are not quick enough to stick your hand in between the doors, or if no one is pressing the door open for you from the inside, it is very easy to miss your lift, something that happened to us and many other guests during our stay. Checking in did take quite a while, and after we were all assigned rooms, we found our four rooms close to each other and on the 11th floor. We requested rooms away from the elevators, but unfortunately found that one of our rooms was next to the lifts and my room was the next one over. So yes, we were woken up a few times during the night by noisy guests coming back early in the morning. One of the first things we noticed about our standard room was that the air-conditioner gauge was not working. Because the temperature was stuck at a degree that we felt was a bit uncomfortable, we eventually called someone to fix it, which he did (after we insisted twice), but from then we actually left the air-conditioner off because we found the temperature setting had only two settings - arctic and off... The room looked a little old, was modestly furnished with some of it looking a little worse for wear. Our room had a one particular table that I had placed my suit case apon, but after closer inspection, I removed it because I did not want to be billed for a broken table. What took the cake though, was the two small single beds for my wife and I. Our other travel companions consisted of another couple also suffered the same fate and although we didn't bother trying to ask for another room, I overheard three different conversations during our stay of the desk clerks apologising to guests that there were no double beds available. We thought about joining the beds together, but as there was a bedside table bolted to the wall, we decided it was just easier to have some 'alone time' from each other during our short stay. The room wasn't very big, but there was enough room to walk around without bumping into everything. It was also clean and quiet with very little noise from outside penetrating the window, except for one morning. We were there for the end of Ramadan and because the hotel is located next to a decent sized mosque, we were woken up very early one morning from their prayers, celebrating the end of Ramadan. The bathroom was pretty much standard and clean, although the towels weren't the best quality. Maybe a bit of fabric softener would have be helpful. The hotel is situated on top of a small three floor shopping centre, but the shops are mainly for the locals and besides a few souvenir shops, they consisted of goods and services that us tourists weren't interested in. When it came to shopping, Bugis Junction and Bugis markets was only 5 minutes away. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, but there was a food court across the road and again Bugis Junction (and Starbucks) just 5 minutes further down the road. Our rooms were cleaned whenever we left the sign out (which wasn't designed very well and would always fall off the door handle whenever you turned the handle), and check out again was a slow process, this time mainly due to waiting in line.

The hotels.com website states \"Renovation Notice. The Executive Club rooms will be undergoing renovations until the end of April 2006.\" We had booked and paid for a renovated Executive Club room on the upper floors for comfort and relaxation.

We immediately asked Reception for a room change and/or a refund but were told that only non-renovated standard rooms were available on the lower floors and no refund could be offered as the booking was made via hotels.com. We asked the Duty Manager why the hotel offered \"executive club\" rooms to well paying guests, knowing that building work was taking place in close proximity. His only reply was that a lot of guests are sightseeing or out on business during the day. This is obviously not the case for people who are on holiday, have just arrived exhausted after a long haul flight, and are hoping to rest in a quiet and comfortable room during the heat of the day! When pushed, the Duty Manager offered us an alternative \"day room\" for use during the day only. Each morning at 0900, tired after being woken by the noise, we had to present ourselves at reception to collect the key and return it again in the evening. The day room was uncomfortable, unclean and stank of cigarette smoke - it was barely used. Our stopover in Singapore was supposed to be a stress free and relaxing holiday, and also incorporated a birthday celebration.
