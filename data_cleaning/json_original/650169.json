Easy walk to the Eiffel Tower and the Bateaux Mouche at the Seine. For Paris rates its a gem, breakfast is continental no probs rooms are clean if basic staff very helpful and friendly rates are great for the location, go to Marriott or Charles V etc if you want to pay for 5* accomodation in the same area? Lift is quaint two persons at a time! luggage optional! We had a room with a small balcony with double doors opening onto the street below very atmospheric.

I had Emailed my credit card info to the manager months ago, and had received a written confirmation online, signed by \"the manager\" ,for 3 nights. My husband and I were returning from a 10-day whirlwind drive through Switzerland and France, and arrived at the hotel after returning our rental car, exhausted and loaded with luggage at 9 pm. The night man told us we had no reservation, refused to call the manager at home, finally did so to be told my reservation and credit card info were never received (although I was brandishing print-outs of their confirmation in my hand), etc. I had to call the police, who came immediately, but told me that although what the hotel did was absolutely dishonest and unprofessional, there was no police case as there was no crime committed (They had not charged my card). At that point the night attendant suddenly found out that a room might be available (for one night) at midnight because \"a client might be leaving\" but since they were booked for the next days, they would take pity on us and give us shelter (not free of course) for that night. To make a long story short, my husband and I walked around in the neighborhood another half hour (it was almost midnite by then), found another hotel nearby, and stayed there 4 nights at a higher rate. There are several small but clean hotels on the little streets between Avenue Carnot and Avenue MacMahon (an area which I prefer because of its proximity to the Air France Airport bus terminal at Etoile.

We should have checked with Trip Advisor to see other recommendations. We had 2 rooms on the 3rd floor. The lobby appeared very clean and gave no clue of the condition of our rooms. We knew this to be a budget hotel and didn't expect much. Safety and cleanliness was our main objective. The hotel is in a safe area, but cleanliness was just as important to us, and we were sorely disappointed. Both rooms were very substandard to say the least. The old furniture didn't bother us. Our disappointment was from the condition of the rooms. The hallway and the rooms stenched (carpet probably does not get cleaned regularly), shower curtains were old and mildewed with black spots all over. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I would rather pay more to have a clean place to stay.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nevada", "Title": "\u201cBest bet for the money\u201d", "Author": "NevadaRoss", "ReviewID": "UR8420018", "Content": "We stayed here several years ago and I'm glad it is still getting good reviews.

Bare bones, with a great price. I typically paid around $50-60 per night a few years back (haven't been since 2003). I'm posting this review since I only see one other for this hotel. Have stayed here mulitple times over the past 10 years. Rooms all have a super tiny private bath (dinky dinky!), with a charming elevator that holds 2 French people, or one American (it's about 24\" x 24\"). Squishing my bags in with me was a hoot. :) First stayed here based on positive reviews read on other sites, and kept coming back. This is not a 5 star hotel. It's a 2 star, with a great price for travelers on a budget. Staff is very friendly, and there is a complimentary coffee w/bread and jam each morning. This may not sound like much, but remember-- this is Paris. Excellent quality food. I took the Air France bus from the airport (it drops you off 3 blocks from the hotel-- and easy walk if you have wheeled luggage). So a big savings compared to taxis or shuttles. I fell in love w/this location b/c I walked all over Paris each day. It's 3 blocks from the Arch de Triumphe (that's where the bus lets you off, a cool intro for a 1st timer!). The Arch is at the start of the Champs Elysees, which is a long, but incredibly beautiful boulevard walk to the Louvre and Toullieries gardens. I never tired of walking (had great walking shoes-- best money I spent on the entire trip). If you love walking, it was just so cool to walk the Champs Elysees each day, and then veer off to the Opera House, the Mus\u00e9e d' Orsay, the Isle St Louis . . . I could go on and on. Some travelers prefer locations with a view of the Eiffel Tower. For me, this was not important. I took the subway to see both this and Mus\u00e9e Marmottan (great collection of Monets' work, including Impression Sunrise). Having a place so centrally located was incredible (I walked virtually everywhere). I truly felt more a part of the city for it. Haven't been to Paris since I started innkeeping (in late 2003), so you'll want to check other travel sites to make sure this hotel is still run by the same friendly folks. When I stayed, I spent about $55 per night. I'm guessing it will be about double that now, given what's happened to the dollar. Still, it was a bargain.
