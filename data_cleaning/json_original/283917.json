It's tucked away in a nice quiet residential neighborhood a few blocks NE of the Vatican. The location was not bad for anyone who was willing to walk to the sites which we did, otherwise it was a bit off the path. There was a municipal bus that stopped nearby that would take you to old Rome. Some coins and a good bus map will get you there and back. The entrance to the hotel, like many in Italy it seems, is a bit subtle and you have to watch for it. We even walked by it one evening after we had checked in. The service was good although not terribly outgoing but they were helpful when asked questions about getting around and for recommendations on where to eat. The room was essentially a one bedroom apartment sized to European standards. When we reserved we asked for a room with two beds. Expecting a bedroom with 2 beds we were surprised to see one bed in the bedroom and a day bed kind of couch in the living room. Furnishings were new and of good KD furniture quality but a bit spartan. The quality of the bedding was not great either especially on the day bed. The bathroom was the biggest challenge. We had read in other reviews on this site about a bathroom that was tiny and with a shower that leaked all over the floor. Unless all the bathrooms are all the same I believe we had this bathroom. It was small by US standards but impeccably clean, nicely finished and had all the requisite fixtures for a European bathroom. The shower had no curtain but was 1/3 enclosed with a glass door. Unfortunately no matter how hard one tried to keep the shower water (with a hand held head) away from the door water flooded the floor and had to be mopped up. A bar and shower curtain would be an easy fix in this case. We both ended up sitting in the tub and taking sponge bath and rinse. The hot water is scalding hot and we both burned ourselves a tad on the faucet body. There was a considerable amount of mold & mildew around the tub area as well, way more than many people would be comfortable with. My biggest beef was noise. It would appear that the Villa has some longer term residents that have no compunction about carrying on long and loud conversations in the hallways at any time of day. The high ceilings in the hallway only echoed the noise making it difficult to sleep. I was also awakened after midnight by a howling dog that was obviously in the building and was allowed to carry on for an hour or so. The bathroom quirks I can forgive but the noise will prevent a return visit for my part.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maidstone, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVALUE FOR MONEY IN ROME\u201d", "Author": "thekingskent", "ReviewID": "UR119683236", "Content": "Very good location.

We arrived very late on a Saturday night and reception were there to welcome us. We had an apartment that had a single bed downstairs with kitchenette and balcony and two flights of stairs up to a double bedroom and bathroom.The bathroom had a small slipper bath with shower in which we found quite difficult to use, the shower screen was broken and the floor tiles became very slippery. Apart from that it was fine. Only basic kitchen utensils,no microwave or kettle but a fridge and freezer and a grill and two hot rings.We found the beds comfortable and loved sitting on the balcony in the evenings. We bought a weekly metro and bus ticket and started our journey by filling our water bottles at the fountain across the road next to the bus stop. Two stops to Cipro Metro stop or stayed on the 913 longer to next metro.There is a Barclays cash machine right outside the villa and a small supermarket left and the first right. Very good pizzas just up the road right from villa or had a takeaway from the pub which is down the road left. We tried a restaurant on the corner just down from the villa which someone had previously recommended but we were very disappointed. Food turned up cold and not the steak we ordered. Service was not good. Although this is a small bus ride away from metro we found buses frequent and metro easy to use to see all the sites of Rome. We were ripped off by a guide who charged us 15E for a tour of the Colosseum but left us after 20 mins of information and on a day of free entry. We also did an open top bus trip which was enjoyable but was told it was two hours but it was less than one. We found lots of the slots for earphones for the commentary were broken so missed most of it until lots of people got off the bus.We went to see the Pope, who came out to meet the people at the Vatican.(Every Wednesday about 10.30am.) Highlights for us was the Vatican Museum and the Sistine Chapel.

Location wise, it's fine if you're willing to have a bit of a walk - the hill isn't that steep but after you've spent 6 hours walking around, it's tempting to catch the bus from the bottom of the hill just to avoid it. The bedroom was small but the bed unnecessarily huge, which made it a bit squashed, but unless you spend a lot of time sitting watching TV it won't be a problem. The living room was of a decent size, with a kitchenette (2 hobs, no oven or anything), a microwave, a dining table and 2 cabinets. It was absolutely clean which I loved, and the cleaners came in daily to empty bins and wipe down the tables. I'm honestly not sure how often we got the sheets changed or the towels, but it was at least once in the week. The neighbourhood is safe and quiet, and the Carrefour supermarket (5 minute walk away) is five times cheaper than the central Roman equivalent. There's a nice pizza place that did takeaways for 5 euros, and an Irish pub down the road which had a nice atmosphere.

Also, on the way to the Metro there was a public \"water fountain\" where you could stop and fill up your bottles (and fill them on your way home) - it was great. There is also a delicious pizza/pasta place just a few minutes up the street and we ate there three times. They have a very nice outside eating area and the service was great, the food spectacular.

The 913 bus (that runs down to the Ottaviano metro) stops right in front of the hotel, but no matter what time of day or night we were on it, it was ALWAYS crowded. We figured out a trick by the end. Skip the first bus and catch the second. They're not spaced that far apart, and everyone crowds on to the first one, leaving much more room on the second one. Seriously - SUPER crowded. lol Once at the metro, you can get to most of the tourist sites in the city or walk about 10-15 minutes straight down Via Ottaviano and you're at the Vatican.

We came to this hotel by bus and when we reached the hotel bus stop, we took a while to search for the hotel as its signboard is really too small to be noticeable. The two hotel staff (one Italian and one Philipino) are friendly and both speak English. There is no lift access to our room that situated at 2nd floor on the right side of the lobby. However, there is a small lift to serve the rooms at the left side of lobby. Thanks to the Italian staff who helped me to carry my luggage up to the room. As expected, the room is clean, not big but just good enough for couple like us, with air-conditioning, a small LCD tv and bathroom with heater and bathtub. We took bus to Cipro and Ottaviano station and then take metro to travel everywhere in Rome. Rome is really a beautiful place that full of history, impressive sculpture and architecture. I will definitely go back to this hotel again. Transport Tips : We reached the hotel from FCO airport by taking the SIT bus (Eur 8) which will go to Piazza Cavour and Termini. As the hotel is located close to Vatican City, so we aligned at Piazza Cavour and then take bus no. 913 which will stop in front of the hotel. To go to Vatican City or Ottaviano Station, you can take bus no. 913 or 907 (about 3 stops) to Cipro Station. The bus stop is just right opposite the hotel. Travel Tips : Buy 3-Day Roma Pass which allows you to have unlimited rides on bus & metro and enter to two museum/attraction for free and subsequent other entry at discounted rate. Join a Vatican City tour (Eur 40) to avoid the long queue. Don't worry about finding the tour package as the tour agent will approach you directly while you are queuing outside the Vatican Museum. Food Tips : The nearby Italian restaurant - Nuraghe Sardo Ristorante down the hill towards Vatican City serves nice steak at reasonable price. Another good stuff is the Chinese restaurant that is not far away from hotel towards the up hill where you can find cheap and nice fried rice at Eur 2.50 and other good dishes.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holbrook, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "paulvu84", "ReviewID": "UR110799031", "Content": "The location of this villa is very close to the Vatican City and metro stations.

Our Experience: Immediately upon arrival, we were five hours early. I was not sure if we would wait or if there was an early check in fee as it is the normative for our culture, however, I must say, the staff was extremely inviting and very helpful. They allowed for us to check in without hassle or worry and even provided a map with circled locations to see. The map includes the MUST See\u2019s of Rome. The hotel staff makes it convenient for you and your party. The rooms are exactly as they call it, studio size equipped with all your basic essentials. Our studio room was absolutely perfect for two people as more than likely, you time will be well spent outside in the city. The room we got was number 9 on the second level which happen to overlook the rear of the building (concrete court). It is very quite there and peaceful through out the day and night. We felt safe walking all around the area and noticed a considerable amount in difference with prices when eating near the hotel area versus the tourist hot spots. We managed to stay away from the popular tourist hot spots for food and ventured off to other areas and even on a couple of occasions, we cooked our own breakfast in kitchen. Other Tad Bits of Information: The service for the room was great. We received fresh hand towels everyday and the room was freshened up on a daily basis. We were not sure if we ask for towels and new sheets but we managed just fine with the two large towels for the week and the sheets we had were fine. If you plan to do a lot of walking, more than likely, you'll have many showers during the dawn and evening hours so we were not concerned over fresh towels and sheets daily or every other day as the showers did the purpose. The experience is what we came for. Either way, the room was still clean and fresh. Recommendations: If you have not planned your guided tours already, you can do this through the hotel. We booked one tour in the States and than the rest while we were at the hotel. Please use the hotel staff in the office to book for you. Our inadvertent mistake was walking the city and finding the main office (Carranni Tours) for tours. They advertisement shows FREE pick up and basically you confirm your pick up when you reserve. We went inside and booked the tour but the next day nobody came like they said they would. We asked the hotel staff if they usually run late. For the most part, use the office to book. It is amazing at the difference in treatment when using the hotel versus walking in. Please BOOK ALL YOUR TOURS through them if possible and not at the main office if you use the same company we did. It will be a much smoother transition for you and your party. To Eat: Try the Nuraghe Sardo Ristorante. They are on the same street as the hotel but down the hill directly at a corner. The ristorante is yellow in color and has outside seating available. They are extremely polite and will show you the best time. The old man waiter is the best! Depending on how fast you walk, the average time down hill for us was no longer than five minutes to the ristorante. We will be happy to answer any questions if there are any on the hotel. Please feel free to ask. There is much more to know than I can type in this review, especially if this is your first time in Europe.

And a balcony facing the not so noisy street. Staff is friendly and will give you advise and directions. A good Chinese restaurant and a Pizzeria is just a block up the street on the same side. A well stocked Supermarket is a short walk on the left side about a block as well as a deli like store where you can buy Bus tickets. We bought a 4 day Metro/Autobus ticket that allowed us to unlimited Bus and Metro train ride. Walk to the bus stop across the street and take Bus 913 if you want to go to downtown where you can either take the Metro train to various sights or walk around.

It was two bus stops to the hotel. Staff were friendly and efficient. Hotel locks up at 2300 but you have keys to the front gates and hotel as well as the room. We stayed in Apartment 13 which is at the back which was good because the front facing rooms overlook the main road and could get a bit noisy and I guess it was about 30 square metres including a small kitchenette. In general we would leave the hotel in the morning and walk 10 mins to the big roundabout junction and then decide whether to walk another 10 mins to St Peters Square, get the bus or metro. In the evening we would either take the metro or the bus 913 which terminates close to the Spanish Steps. I recommend Villa Tassoni for it's location but you need to speak a bit of Italian if you are going to stop for breakfast somewhere local. On our way back we caught the Leonardo Express from Termini.

We stayed in March 2010 for 6 nights. Our room overlooked the busy main road which I expect was more noisy than a room which didn't, but for us it was not a problem because we live on a busy main road at home and don't forget this apartment is situated in central Rome which is a capital city so you should expect some noise! We arrived early but our room was ready. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly and we were provided with a map pointing out all the key sites, supermarket, bus stops restaurants etc. The room was cleaned daily with towels and sheets changed every other day. For the English amongst us there isn't an electric kettle so if you don't fancy boiling pans of water for hot drinks bring one along. The kitchenette is simple but adequate so long as you don't expect to do major cooking. The apartment is simply yet sensitively and attractively furnished in line with its historic roots whilst being good value for money. The bathroom was a bit cramped but as you don't spend much time in it it is fine. As others have described, the villa is located in a residential area about 15 minutes walk from the Vatican. There is a bus stop opposite which takes you down into the centre plus the metro (Cipro) at the bottom of the hill - or you can walk which we preferred to do most of the time. There is a more than adequate supermarket within a five minute walk (first right and then first left down the road) plus a good Pizzeria just up the road which was always busy with local people.

It comprised a bathroom, bedroom and kitchenette where one could prepare a light meal. I had cable TV, a direct phone link to my room and a free broadband connection. Initially, I was not able to connect my computer because of the difference in the connections between Italy and my country but it was immediately dealt with by the staff. One man allowed me to share his wireless connection until the adapter for my computer was got. The house was always kept spotless and my room was cleaned every day with bed linen and towels changed twice a week. Since the weather got cold in mid October the place was beautifully heated which made it very comfortable. I found a very welcoming and friendly atmosphere among the staff and management. The studio was very secure and that was important to me since I was alone. The local area was quiet yet every type of shop and amenity was available there. Transport in Rome is excellent and buses and Metro lines were so easily accessible from Villa Tassoni. From the Termini Station in central Rome you can go to almost any where in Europe. Visiting Rome is a tremendous experience and it was an added bonus to live in the Villa which has an old world charm though very comfortably maintained. During my stay I met people from many different parts of the world and they also spoke of the tremendous experience it is to visit Rome and be able to get to places of interest so easily. Granted there were crowds of tourists everywhere so it was a welcome relief to withdraw from the hustle and bustle back to the peace and quiet of the Villa on some occasions. I found Rome to be such a marvelous experience and if I ever had a chance to visit Rome again I would certainly stay at Villa Tassoni.... so affordable, a really tremendous place to stay.

My apartment had none of the amenities promised/advertised on the website: no air conditioning (a particular hardship considering the wretched 95 degree heatwave this summer); no working phone line; no working television (one channel of fuzzy \"snow\"); no extra set of keys (I was sharing one set of keys with another student whose schedule was opposite mine... what a mess! Not to mention that our single set of keys didn't open the main gate to the residence, so we had to beg people to let us in at night... And when we begged for a spare set, we were told to go to the nearest hardware store to make our own copies); no laundry service (this was a special service purportedly organized by our university with Tassoni, but when we inquired about it, we were given puzzled looks and told to go to a laundrymat); no working intercom to buzz in one's roommate or visitors (a particular problem when you have no working phone line either); no fans (you have to go to the desk and beg for one, and the one we got was broken); irregular staff hours (during office hours, the staff was rarely in the office and acted put upon when we asked for anything); no facilities tour upon arrival (we were here a month and only on the LAST DAY learned that there was in fact a breakfast room somewhere on premises... nice to know after weeks of spending money on breakfast!!); and an internet connection that was sporadic at best (which made it impossible to get any work done from the apartment). The staff were unhelpful, the room was dirty, we rarely received fresh towels and linens, and we had to resort to purchasing our own toilet paper because the maids refused to leave us any! The neighborhood in which the residence is situated has nothing to offer, and is a fifteen minute walk from the nearest subway station. It's not even in the city center proper, and is not located on any city center maps. It is not, in other words, \"just minutes\" from Vatican City-- more like a 20 minute hardcore hike. My roommate and I were here a month, for which we paid the obscene equivalent of nearly 3000 USD for a crappy apartment masquerading as a four-star hotel. Keep in mind that we could have easily booked a room elsewhere for quarter of this price. I know, because I lived in Rome for several years and am quite familiar with housing and rental costs here. For years, for example, I rented a room in an apartment in the real city center of Rome for $350/month. So imagine my irritation at spending many times that for no amenities, no location, no service, and so on. Had we known that the amenities advertised on the website were not in fact available here, we'd have booked elsewhere, but we didn't learn anything about the true lack of amenities until the night before we arrived in Rome, when it was too late to book another accommodation. One important side note: if you're a young attractive female, beware of Villa Tassoni. One of the desk clerks kept asking me out and when I gave him a firm \"no thank you\", he was surly with me for the rest of my stay and wouldn't help me with anything.

I cannot express how friendly the staff was. The manger, Christian was so very helpful. He showed us how to get around Rome using the bus and underground. He explained how things worked and gave us maps on where things of interest were and how to get there. He did his very best to make us comfortable and feel like we were welcome. Staying at this hotel, visiting the Valtican, the Colosseam and Palantine was the highlite of our Italy vacation.

Unfortunately, it is nothing like that in reality. The hotel is very old and run down, the rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are almost scary to use and the kitchen disgraceful.

My grandmother could kick it off and run off with it (all right, she couldn't run but you get the point) It is near to nowhere and during the night, there were street kids running around and yelling all hours of the nights.
