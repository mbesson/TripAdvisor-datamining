Affordable, quiet and guest friendly !!!\u201d", "Author": "Michael S", "ReviewID": "UR119328176", "Content": "I've just come back after a 4-days stay at this hotel, and I am very pleased. Very affordable room tariffs, our room size was good (2 adults and 2 chidlern in a Executive Quad Lux.). Breakfast was continental, simple - but had all you need to start off on a good days sightseeing. Everything was clean, nice and neat. Holland Road can be a bit noisy, seems like a usual route for Emergency Units, so remember your earplugs if you open the windows at night. We were lucky enough to get a room on the garden side, so the noise did not bother us much. Hotel service is good and staff was very friendly and helpful! To all who complain about the room size; (wake up, this is London!), the location, the noise or anything; you always get what you pay for! This is, in my opinion, a very affordable hotel. You get a clean room and bed, breakfast included, few minutes away from many bus stops or the Underground. Also to take into account, is that Holland Park is only a short walk away, with great opportunities and activities for those with younger children. When I go back to London, I will definately concider this hotel again.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money and good location\u201d", "Author": "diasryan", "ReviewID": "UR119067876", "Content": "The room was small but was aliright.

The front desk staff here could not be more helpful. Their knowledge of the neighborhood and recommendations for local eateries were great. One of our group had a dental emergency, and the staff arranged appointments with an excellent dentist right away. The rooms were clean and the continental breakfast was better than we had expected. While not the hotel's fault, it was hot in London, and the London Visitors Hotel has no A/C. Open windows cooled the rooms at night, but the traffic noise was disturbing at best. The nearest tube station is Kensington (Olympia) Zone 2. If you're looking for a clean, inexpensive hotel in a safe neighborhood, consider this one.

Having lived in London for years, and around the corner from the hotel for one of these years - this location is fantastic! Travellers to the city might be aware that the term 'hotel' in London can mean anything from a block of flats to a selection of small dirty cupboards serving as rooms- and I have never stayed anywhere in central London so clean. My room was the smallest in the place (they told me so), but quiet, spotless and cleaned daily - FAR superior to other small hotels even on Holland Road ( have stayed at others, as have friends/family so can make comparison) Staff very friendly, very helpful.

Whilst I found the staff friendly, my room was depressing, yellow woodchip wallpaper, sheets and blankets, crittal windows with secondary double glazing, it was like stepping back in time, it was all rather horrible really. Breakfast was continental!! the choice was stale white bread with either jam or marmalade, cornflakes, orange juice, stewed tea or coffee which was ok. there was also Mr Kipling Apple Pies for breakfast and lemon cake which I mistook for a bread and put in the toaster, didn't realise until i was offered it one evening with my coffee. Could be a really nice hotel if only they would spend some money on it, excellent location for exhibitions - real shame really but it is their loss at the end of the day.", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "N Ireland", "Title": "\u201cIs this the Worst Hotel in London??\u201d", "Author": "Fivemiletown", "ReviewID": "UR48498794", "Content": "A very UNwelcome at reception 3.5 % credit card charge asked for ice - we dont do ice asked for an iron - we dont allow irons room - while clean was a cupboard toilet - have to side sideways as not enough room sink is for a child shower - hot when it got going", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "san clemente, ca", "Title": "\u201cThe room was the size of a closet!\u201d", "Author": "laurieSanClemente_Ca", "ReviewID": "UR27959734", "Content": "My sister and I stayed at the London Visitors Hotel at the beginning and end of an 11 day trip.
