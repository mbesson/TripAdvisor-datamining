I'd booked the lagoon-view room through the Stamford website using the Advanced Saver rate of $165 (the normal rate for the room was quoted as $275 at the time). I arrived on the Saturday afternoon at 2.45pm, well after the check-in time of 2pm. Despite this, and despite booking the room months earlier, the receptionist informed me my room wasn't ready. She explained the hotel had been booked out the night before, thus housekeeping were a little overwhelmed. She asked if I wouldnt mind waiting for a bit, so I sat in the lobby. The receptionist was lovely, I can't emphasise that enough. Her people skills were excellent and all done with a smile. When she realised I'd been waiting for half an hour, she organised another room for me and also apologised. The room was the same type I had booked, so no problems there. It was clean and roomy and well-appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable. There were plenty of tea and coffee supplies and the water in the shower had a good, strong force. The furnishings were of an okay standard. All in all, a happy experience. This was capped off perfectly by the room service breakfast the following morning. I ordered the Stamford's version of Eggs Benedict with spinach and beautiful fresh bread. It was TO DIE FOR. Check-out was a bit slow; there was only one girl at the desk and people in front of me. I would have assumed that at 11am, the check-out deadline, there would be sufficient staff to deal with the rush. The same rule of thumb should apply to housekeeping. The Stamford is a huge hotel, so it stands to reason that there should be sufficient housekeeping staff -especially on a weekend. However, those minor quibbles aside, I enjoyed my stay very much.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taree", "Title": "\u201cOver priced for what it is.\u201d", "Author": "WandaSandhills", "ReviewID": "UR127331619", "Content": "The hotel is obviously geared to cater for business people and conferences as the rates are equal to many of the better hotels in the Sydney CBD.

The public areas such as the faux grotto near the pool and the hallways could do with a bit of tarting up, but our room was nicely furnished and clean.

Unfortunately, the bed was very hard but not overly so, although we both woke up a bit stiff.

This hotel has exceptional quality in service. The staff were very friendly and professional. You MUST dine in their restaurant! The first night my partner and I had the seafood buffet, yes it does cost $65, but the quality of food was of the highest standard (and plus, it would work out cheaper than having a 3 course a la carte). Dessert selection was to die for. Cheese platters. Seafood: mussels, oysters, smoked salmon, crab, octopus, prawns...! The quality of the lamb, beef and pork cuisines were amazing. If you dine here, try to have an early dinner (6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 6:30), there are less people dining and walking around the buffet area, and the dishes are well presented and untouched. The next day, buffet breakfast: the best scrambled eggs I have had in a hotel! Bircher museli was made deliciously as well, nice and sweet, other hotels make it quite bland. The hotel has a lovely lagoon and pool, where my partner and I went for a stroll after breakfast. I assumed that since other reviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s implied that this hotel is losing its elegant touch, that the pond would be infested with algae and lifeless. I was pleased to watch many koi fish become excited by our presence by swarming under our feet by the board walk, probably hoping that we would feed them! Laying by the pool side and soaking up the rising morning sun was bliss! We headed out to Macquarie Centre, which is literally around the corner, went for some retail therapy, and watched a movie, then drove back \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; it was totally stress-free! We ordered room service for lunch, fast and friendly service, the Stamford burger was very tasty and meaty and the cannelloni was very nice as well. At night we chose the a la carte menu. Cause we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overly hungry, we skipped the entrees, and went straight for mains. My partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lamb was cooked to perfection! And my duck was to die for, with the meat falling off the bone! For dessert, my partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cr\u00c3\u00a8me brulee was light textured and subtly sweet, and my chocolate implosion was a decadent chocolate overdose (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s if you enjoy dark chocolate). Breakfast the next morning was just as perfect. Upon reading the other reviews, I was slightly reluctant to stay here but gave it a go anyways. I can see what the other reviews meant by the hotel needs a coat of paint, it didn't really bother me. The bathroom was pretty small, and the toilet was crammed between the basin and the shower, which did feel like an aeroplane cubicle. However, our superior suite had a spa bath, which I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware of upon booking, which was a bonus! The hairdryer provided was amazingly powerful (sunbeam ionic hairdryer), not many hotels provide good hairdryers! The room was clean and spacious, i thought the decor was nothing of extraordinary or elegant, but it was comfortable. Bed was not as plush as I was hoping for from Stamford, and it would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been nice to have complimentary bath robes and slippers, especially since this is a resort style hotel. My partner had no complaints at all, maybe thats cause he is a guy. There were asian tourists staying at the hotel on the second night (i can say this and not sound racist cause i am asian as well lol), but they were making so much noise on the hallways and outside my room at night, i had to tell them to be quiet. Also, my room faced epping rd, and the ranch hotel guests were making some infrequent noise aswell, but it didnt really affect my quality of sleep, but i guess i cant give fault to the hotel for this, maybe next time i stay i would get the deluxe suite that faces the pool/lagoon.

Apparently the website we used does not 'speak' to the Stamford website, so although we had been charged for the room, Stamford had not been paid. This caused a great deal of confusion on check-in, but after a while we sorted it out and were told that our breakfasts would be complimentary as a gesture of goodwill. Upon checkout the hotel attempted to charge us the full price for the breakfasts because we had used room service instead of the dining room. I replied that this distinction had not been made. The attitude I encountered from the manager was startling; he agreed to waive the charge, but insisted that \"Everyone coming into the hotel knows that breakfast is in the dining room\"...implying that I was either naive or an idiot. You don't get that kind of attitude from good hotels which deserve their star rating because they understand that the important thing is customer service. The Stamford's manager seem to think the important thing is to be right. So, stressful check-in AND stressful check-out. Was the actual hotel any good? Once you get past the faded opulence of the foyer, there's no more opulence and plenty of 'faded'. Our room - optimistically referred to by the desk clerk as a 'suite' - was tucked-away at the furthest reaches of the hotel. We were travelling with our 18-month old son and had to carry the pram over three sets of stairs to reach the room. There was a lift, but it was at the opposite end of the hotel, so that wasn't any quicker. When we got to the room it reeked of cigarette smoke. On the Saturday night we could not sleep because of the noise of the hotel staff; our room was above the alley where the kitchen staff stand, smoking and talking. Loudly. There was also noise from the other rooms; we could hear people talking. The one good thing I can say about the place is that the food was excellent. Some of the best gnocchi I've ever had still couldn't make-up for the disappointment of the experience. I might have been happy if it were a three star hotel, but the place is so run-down.

However, check-in turned out to be almost an hour with me running around like a headless chook. After having no luck with finding our names on the hotel booking system, we were asked to provide our booking confirmation, which was fine, and given a key to the room.

Gave a call to reception (and it was picked up by the very person that checked us in) to tell him about our problem. He explained that we should turn on the switch near the bed, not the one on the wall???? The room was absolutely dark so after 5 mins trying to switch on everything that I could reach, I gave up and called reception again. I suspected that he recognized my room number and thought I was a trouble-marker (???) so he didn't bother to pick up the phone. I rang twice (and left it ringing for a long while) but no one picked up!!!!! Had to make my way to reception again, the front desk again tried to explain to me where the switch should be and what I should do blah blah blah before I lost my temper and told him that I could not see a thing in the dark! At last, he asked someone to go and fix the lights. This gentleman was nice talking to, explained to me that the light on the wall was for nothing (!!!), and he showed me how to turn on the tall lamp near the bed , but he himself failed to turn on the 2 side lamps. He then told me that he would get that fixed as soon as possible. And that was never been fixed or replaced as I heard from my Dad. What a terrible service! You called yourself 4.5 stars, please at least check if everything in the room functions the way it should be.

We had eaten in the restaurant many times in the past but had never actually stayed in the hotel. The hotel itself is fairly unique- resort style but in a business park. The rooms are adequate and the decor of the hotel is reasonable. The one thing that sets this hotel in North Ryde apart from its competitors is the staff and service. We were politely greeted by a young man named Michael at check in, and he was just very nice. He was such a respectful young man and made us feel so welcome. We ate breakfast in the restaurant both mornings (which was a great buffet with so many options- a little too many when you are on a diet) and both times we were greeted by a young girl named Maria- she had to be one of the nicest people we have ever come across in customer service. She individually said hello and good morning to every single customer with lovely smile on her face. She was absolutely wonderful! She was also there at lunch time on our second day and served us a very impressive seafood pie. She looked after us as if we were VIP's! In fact all of the staff in the restaurant were excellent. Even the housekeepers were nice- we some how managed to get lost in the hotel and a lady named Mary helped us find our way back to the hotel entrance.

Obviously key didn't work on the door, so I had to wait outside the room with our bags while my husband walked back to the lobby to sort this out. After 20 minutes of sitting outside the corridoor, husband came back with new keys to another room, so we had to lug our luggage to the other room. After unpacking, discovered that internet is not working. Took the entire night and numerous reminder calls to front desk and Docomo and missed dinner, still couldn't get the internet working. Staff and ISP kept insisting it's our notebook settings, we reminded them we had 2 notebooks and both not working. Besides, we had just moved from the Marriott at Circular Quay and didn't have any problems. Anyway, they promised that by 10am the next day it would be up and running... Day 2 Woken up by drilling sounds from restaurant renovation downstairs and tough luck, internet service still not working. Hotel engineers came and went, calls to Docomo, we finally gave up and went out while they said they would sort out the problem. We were extremely upset after the messed-up check-in and internet problems, asked front desk to have Paul Gallop call us since he seemed very interested for guests to feedback. After our return in the evening, we enquired about the internet issue at front desk, they were clueless about the status and asked us to check on our own in the room. So we suspected that no one actually did anything about the problem. Checked again, didn't work. Went to front desk to get the key to another room and brought my laptop to test in the other room. Bingo! Works afterall... guess everyone was wrong when they were so sure that it was our internet settings and not their internet service. So unfortunately, had to pack up again and change rooms since we're here on a business trip so internet is crucial... but fortunately because now we didn't have to call Housekeeping since they have convieniently decided that we didn't need replenished shower gel, shampoo and conditioner when they cleaned the room. Was exhausted by the time we unpacked (again) in the new room, and before we retired for the evening, we realized that the General Manager never called. Day 3 Relived that we finally have internet service, but discovered in the morning that the room safe is not working! Before leaving the hotel for the day, informed the front desk of faulty room safe and please have it fixed. I mean, what else can go wrong in one single stay? Similar to all the inconveniences imposed upon us, staff was not sympathetic and appears indifferent. Or maybe they have just grown immune to guest complaints? Returned to hotel in the evening, room safe still not working. And guess what? They didn't clean up our room too! Also bumped into a friend staying at the same hotel this evening, appeared that when she checked-in she was also allocated an occupied room and had to return to the front desk to get another room. So every night I had to make sure that I bolt the door with the coffee table, since I am not sure if the electronic double locking system actually works and front desk might just decide to give my room keys to a new guest? Also, no call from Paul so far. I suppose he is just not interested in our problems at his hotel. Unfortunately my husband feels bad about moving to the Marriott Courtyard since people at work had made the booking for him, so now I just wonder what else can possibly got wrong for the next 4 nights? Now I just look forward to going home this weekend. Others things I dislike: - Small/cramped bathroom - Tiny shoebox shower stall with a tiny soap tray so there's no where to place toiltries - Shower has no water pressure, takes me double the time to shower (very frustrating!) - Hotel staff's negative attitude to guest's problems caused by faulty or inefficient service (full of excuses with no attempt to fix the problem and require constant reminders to them that the problem is still not fixed - I think maybe they are hoping people will simply give up and go away) - Very limited TV channels, and some channels not working or available like CNN, Music channel - Traffic noise if you stay in the rooms facing the road (they gave us this room despite us telling them we'd like a quiet room) What I like: - Proximity to mall and rail station", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a weekend escape from the city\u201d", "Author": "TDeson", "ReviewID": "UR67731413", "Content": "Needed a break for the long weekend, but I couldn't go too far, so took my partner here.

Our room was down the end of the complex, so we had a little view over the tennis court and could see down to the pool and health club.

We could have sat outside, but it was a bit cold, so we stayed inside and enjoyed the view through the HUGE windows that overlook the gardens here. (There is also a little Koi pond in the gardens - saw some kids having fun feeding the fish). Decided not to stay for the seafood buffet (but it looked good as it was being set up). Apparently they are about to do a major refurb of the restaurant & kitchen. Hope they keep the big windows. Went back to the room, enjoyed a looong spa and jumped on the comfy king bed. Bliss. We were still full from the afternoon tea, so only order a little room service for dinner. Food very good, quickly brought and tasty. Service guy called me \"sir\" - haven't been called that in a while. Settled in to sleep on the comfy king bed. Room very quiet so slept in Sunday (ask for late check out - worth it!). Best Room Service Eggs Benedict we have ever had for breakfast (needed a little garnish on the plate tho). Drove back down to reception to check out. Again with the smiley staff.

The whole area was filthy, the pineapple juice was rancid and when we opted to order a nicer coffee from the bar area it took 25 minutes. The outdoor seating area was always messy as it appears no one ever services it. When you ask for an ashtray the give you these old glass candle holders or an old glass.

This gave the same rate as everyone else without the issues if we wanted to shorten our stay or cancel. The price was excellent for a Friday and Saturday night. We were located in room 2016, which is just near the main entrance on the same level as reception. In fact this was located in a perfect location for getting luggage in and out of the car. The room is marketed as a suite, but to be honest is missing some of the features that I would expect from a suite. The room consists of a small reception area just inside the door. This area has a large desk with Internet and one chair, one lounge chair and a coffee table. Then comes the bathroom with some drawers and a mirror in the corridor, as well as the minibar. This was followed by the bedroom on the far side of the bathroom with a view overlooking the man made pond. There was a small table with two chairs in the bedroom, making a total of four chairs of three types in the suite. There are quite a few things missing from this suite that I would have expected. The main one was door between the bedroom and the rest of the suite. This is a major issue, not because it splits the bedroom from the office area if you want to have a meeting in the room. It is more that the main door from the suite allows all the noise from the corridor in. Being a conference hotel, people often chat in the corridors, and all this comes straight into the room. On the Saturday night we were there they had a piano player in the reception area. We had no problem hearing the words the player was singing and the notes he was playing in our suite down the corridor. I would call this a major issue. Also missing from the meeting area was a second lounge chair which is common in suites from my experience, and a second TV. I looked at the door just before checking out, and it was clear that the door did not really seal. You could actually see light from the corridor come in through the sides of the door jamb. I am not sure that this door needed to be fire rated, but I would not want to be trapped in the room if there was a fire in the corridor as the smoke would billow straight into the room. The bed. Well, what can I say. It certainly did not live up to the amazing beds found in the Rydges hotels. The bed was a bit hard, but that was not what I considered the major issue. In my opinion, the bedding was far too small. In the first time ever in a hotel, by morning the sheets and blanket had not only come out from the sides but also at the bottom. It really seems like they skimped on the bedding, buying the smallest size that would cover the bed. The sheets could not even tuck in on the sides they were so small. And to top this off even the pillows were hard. The restaurant seemed nice, but they had misplaced our booking. More likely, reception who took the booking when I called did not pass it on. Still, they did fit us in. And then proceeded to inform us that it was compulsory Seafood Buffet Night. Great. Many people do not actually like seafood. On checkout I overheard another person checking out also complaining about the lack of prior indication to the guests that Saturday night was Seafood Night. He was unhappy enough to call the prices 'borderline extortion'. Thankfully when we explained about my girlfriends allergy they did offer to cook anything from the normal menu. We were grateful. Once they did take our order we did realise that this was a marketing thing only - the same items were available from the Room Service menu, albeit with a $5 surcharge. The food we did get was nice and reasonably priced, but I declined to pay $15 for desert. I am guessing that their market is for business people on expense accounts who do not flinch at paying so much. There is a nice place across the road that seems much more reasonably price.", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cWhat a waste of money\u201d", "Author": "Trnr", "ReviewID": "UR38125754", "Content": "I stayed here 3 times during August due to the fact it was within walking distance to work and was the cheapest at the time. 1st stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Room was quiet apart from the usual corridor noise.

Therefore, we choose to stay in other hotels in the same neighbourhood. If you can put up paying for what you didn't consume after you left the hotel, rooms in Stamford's new wings are quite nice. Rooms in older wing only worth 4 stars in my opinion (waring out of amenties). One time over my many stay at a room at the old wing, dead crocoach appears in the shower. Well, perhaps it also indicates they did spray the place from time to time. Otherwise, I would encounter a live crocoach instead of a dead one.

This is the third, and probably the last time I will stay in this hotel. The hotel has an unusual layout having a central reception/restaurant area with guest rooms branching off from both sides of it forming a \"U\" shape. This can make for a long walk to your room if you are at the end of one of these wings. The area within the \"U\" is taken up with water gardens and the hotel pool. The leisure club is at the bottom of the complex next to the pool. The room we stayed in was one of their suites and was very nice. Half the lights didn't work in the room and this is one of the problems with this hotel - it feels a bit run down. If you go to the pool be very careful, my daughter cut her foot on the tiles on the floor of the pool and the general state of the pool surround left a lot to be desired, with rusty bolts protruding from the concrete. Generally the staff within the hotel were very nice and the food in the restaurant was OK. The hotels revenue derives from corporate events, meeting rooms, weddings etc. with many staying guests being business travellers and Asian tour groups who come and stay for one night then leave. Breakfast staff on a few mornings were overstretched. My main gripe with the hotel is their inability to get the billing right. Before our stay we were quoted a rate for a family of 4 with breakfast. The hotel reservations failed to put this in their system meaning we were billed for all sorts, breakfasts roll up beds etc.. Trying to correct this took three attempts even though I had all the paperwork with me. The paperwork was photocopied twice by the receptionists even though most of it originated from them. Management were just as useless, sarcastic comments like \"you got a very good rate then\" after it was sorted, does not make for good customer service.

I went to go ask someone and before I even asked for assistance, a hotel employee asked if he could help. Not only did he take us to the lift but he escorted us to our room as well. I thought that was really nice. The room was ok. It was clean and comfortable. Nice big bed and the bathroom was clean and nice.

It is a sad, soul-less, rambling place with too few staff, most of whom seem unhappy to be there. I think if you tapped a few of the guests on the shoulder, they'd tell you they would rather be somewhere else, too! A bit of history: The Stamford North Ryde was built in the 1980s as a low-rise, large-scale 'resort' hotel. It was a dopey idea from the outset, particularly as it is located right next to one of Sydney's busiest arterial roads in a suburb dominated by low-rent housing and corporate/industrial estates. The hotel complex runs parrallel to 8-lane Epping Road and is probably half-a-kilometre in length! There are two wings with a swimming pool in the middle. Reception is at one end and then you walk, walk, walk to your room. Forget about porterage. This place runs on bare minimum staffing. Needless to say, the concept of building a 'resort' in the middle of downmarket suburbia didn't exactly blossum and the original hotel changed hands. Because it would cost so much more to operate such a spread-out property, the current operators are clearly cutting corners. One of the hinges on our front door had been replaced with an ill-fitting, flimsy hinge that looked like it would give way anytime. The holes from the original hinge were neither filled nor painted. Similarly, bathroom fittings had been replaced with cheap, mismatched tapware. Holes in the original tile work had been 'patched' by screwing power outlet 'blanks' into the wall. The telephone didn't work and we were told that nothing could be done about it. Oh, and although the room had been cleaned, it had the embedded odour of a public restroom. Other guests said their rooms also smelled like they'd been cleaned with cheap, harsh chemicals. This property is just like other Stamfords in Australia. Poorly maintained and overpriced for what's on offer. Most of the staff are 'disconnected' with a 'take-it-or-leave-it' approach to guest service. However, the Grand of North Ryde seems to go out of its way to alienate guests, even by Stamford standards. It gets away with it because of high occupancy rates generated by the numerous corporate offices located within a kilometre of the hotel. Look around the bar, dining and reception areas and you'll see many of your fellow guests have that \"I'm staying here because that's where Head Office booked me\" look about them.

Even though our room faced the main road, it was relatively quiet and lovely. Not once did we hear our neighbours or anyone coming and going. Due to this, I booked the Lazy Daze Package in the Executive room for my husband as a suprise birthday present for him to relax and unwind. Per my request hoping for an even quieter room than the room facing the main road, we were checked into the room facing the tennis court, but discovered our room had an inter-connecting door. We both thought it's a bit odd to put us in a room with an inter-connecting door. We thought nothing of it and heard no noise from next door so we didn't request a change of room. While we were getting our massages, someone checked into the room next door on the other side of the connecting door but seemed to have left soon after. Unfortunately, after a VERY pleasant in-room dinner and massage, feeling very relaxed and romantic, the people next door came back into the room and appeared to have kids with them. Kids being kids, they weren't being overtly loud but we could hear them VERY clearly. On top of that, someone directly upstairs of our room seemed to have a problem with walking (more like stomping) back and forth in their room. After 10minutes of the noise, I had enough and reluctantly rang front desk requesting if we could possibly change room knowing it was late - it's around 11pm. Reception informed they will get security to talk to these people. Even though I told them the kids next door are just being kids, we just want to change to a quieter room. They were reluctant to move us to another room. 2 phone calls later, we still were not moved. By this stage, my husband had fallen asleep so I didn't bothered calling back to change our room. Throughout the night I was kept awake by the stomping from upstairs. At 7 in the morning, I was jolted awake from LOUD scrapping & squeeking noises, as if someone was dragging a table across wooden floors. I was annoyed at the fact that I've booked a Lazy Daze package which they've promote to relax and unwind, and yet they booked a family with kids right in the next room. Not only did it got us back on edge but also totally destroyed the romantic mood the inclusive package had created. Imagine On top of that, I was shocked to find out I was not told of a charge of $100 bond when we checked in. Only to discovered when I checked my credit card statement that I got charged $515 instead the rate of $415, and this charge came through after I have paid our account in full when we checked out. After I rang up enquiring about the additional $515 charge, I was told about the bond and that this amount will be reverted back to me in 2-5 days. If not, I have to call them back to get my money back! This is definitely not the way I expected to be treated as a returning guest.

Dining in, the meals are quite reasonable and breakfast is the traditional smorgasbord selection, with very little innovation. The hotel is rambling and now a little tired, with renovations occurring on a continuous cycle. If you're lucky enough to get a recently refurbished room the visit is certainly more pleasant. Rooms can be upgraded to a larger room with office area, which just provides a bit more room if you've got stuff to do and some luggage items. Rooms either overlook the outdoor swimming pool and fountain / bridges, or the garden. Some rooms are a seriously long walk from the reception, so if you can't frequently make the journey, negotiate stairs and doors, request a room nearer the front. As a predominately business location there are rarely children staying. The gym is very small and over-crowded at popular times. The pool is generally quiet.

With the opening of the new Lane Cove tunnel the congested journey to the airport is better, but still takes about an hour, especially in the peak times.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a bit of a face lift\u201d", "Author": "BrisCaz", "ReviewID": "UR7160525", "Content": "I only stayed here three days and it was chosen purely and simply because I was attending a conference that was being held in the hotel. I think it was relatively over-priced but it was ok - possibly needs a refurbish. The tiles in the bathroom and particuarly in the shower recess were not very nice - germophobes beware. My room was overlooking the swimming pool and I was quite happy with the space. There is a weird \"office\" type area as you walk in - which contains a huge desk, a chair and not much else. There is a small \"corridor\" area containing the mini bar and wardrobe on one side and the batchroom on the other and then you get to the bedroom. The bed was king size and quite comfortable. All in all it was ok but I have to agree with some of the reviewers with comments re the staff eg: I arrived the night before the conference and I asked the receptionist where the conference was to be held. She didnt even know anything about the conference and didnt even bother to find out - just told me to come to reception in the morning to find out. Also, when we went to the restaurant for lunch it took 4 different staff members about 15 minutes to find out where we to be seated. I possibly would stay here again if I have business in the area but more likely would stay in apartments as I prefer to cook for myself when I am away.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide", "Title": "\u201cCrappy Hotel + Lousy Attitude\u201d", "Author": "OvationGX2", "ReviewID": "UR6545790", "Content": "The travel agent supplied a \"cut and paste\" review that made me iook forward to staying in the \"Premier\" wing because it sounded really good. The reality............... You enter the crumbling paved driveway and unload your bags while the Bellman stands and watches looking very disinterested. Reception was OK, but then the room was at the far end of a very very long corridor, and to make it interesting there were service trolleys, room service trays, vacuum cleaners and other paraphenalia to navigate past. The corridor is narrow and so you would think the housekeepers would at least keep the trolleys hard against the wall, but no, they did not. The room was spacious and the bathroom was modern and clean, but the toilet seat would not stay raised on its own, so to be a gentleman you had to hold it up with one hand while aiming carefully with the other, The carpet was grubby and stained in various locations, the room was supposed to have robes so you could enjoy the spa bath, but it took 3 calls to housekeeping and a long wait before they arrived. The breakfast buffet was tasteless and poorly presented and we finished our plates before we could get the coffee server to come, and then I had to go ask her. The ceiling of the restaurant was seriously in need of a paint, and there were signs of water leaking around the air conditioning vents. While I blame myself for not researching this dump on Trip Advisor, I am compelled to give this place the thumbs down", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Launceston", "Title": "\u201cFawlty Towers\u201d", "Author": "Traveller531", "ReviewID": "UR5924326", "Content": "The service was so bad that I felt sorry for the staff.

I went on that Saturday service and found it very enjoyable. the breakfasts were good with the choice of continental or full buffet style . we had a meal at the resturaunt in the evening once with friends and they loved the prawns . the prices for the breakfast and meals are normal sydney style which is never cheap but not over the top. overall a very good stay at this hotel and would go there again.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Stamford Grand North Ryde", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d262367-Reviews-Stamford_Grand_North_Ryde-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$159 - $270*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Corner Epping &amp; Herring Roads</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2113</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "262367", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2e/38/d8/lagoon.jpg"}}
