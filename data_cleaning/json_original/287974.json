My room was basic and small. I hated the fact that the curtain did not keep all the light out so I could not sleep very well and it annoyed me in the morning. Also, the breakfast menu was not very varied, but at least it was fresh and tasty. Smoking is not allowed in the room; however I found an ashtray when I got inside, so probably nobody will tell you a thing if you do smoke. On the plus side, my room was really clean and the staff were polite and helpful. The wifi connection was good but I heard some floors have a problem in their internet connection, so be sure to ask if you need it. There is also a computer at the reception for all to use. The hotel itself is at the heart of the city, opposite Dam Square, 10 minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal station, and 5 minute walk from the Red Light District. And there are many coffeshops + smartshops nearby for whomever interested! You can also access all the main tram lines from Dam Square to visit sights around the city!

By foot you can quickly go to the train station and you can easily explore the town from there. There are lots of buses near it. No need to say anything about the area: it's full of life, restaurants, pubs, shops and whatever. The hotel is simple and the location really basic. With basic I mean that in the room there were 1 bed, 1 small wardrobe, 1 small round table, 1 chair, tv and phone, nothing else at all. It was not a big room, but not even too small, the negative aspect was that there isn't any place to put your luggage and stuff, I had lots of my things on the floor. There wasn't even a night table. Private bathroom, it was clean. Wifi for free working fine. I was on the last floor and the lift was until the last but one, so I had to use stairs which is not the best when you are tired and/or with luggage. There are stairs also to go to the reception, something like 8 steps. You can use the safety box for free, just leaving a deposit, but it's at the reception and it's quite small. Breakfast was included and it's basic, too, you can count how many things they offer and it's no more than 10. You can eat as much as you want, but a little bit more variety would be welcome.

I have visited amsterdam around thirty times and have stayed in a number of differnt central hotels. My room in the doria was very close to the worst. We had stayed at the single hotel the two previous nights and although it is basic the single is superiour in every way. We (me and my brother) stayed at the doria due to our flight being cancelled at 11pm at night. I got my girlfriend to book it online from the uk. Knowing amsterdam was busy i considered ourselfs to be very luck to get a hotel room and at 80euro it was much more appealing than sleaping at schipol. When we got to the hotel we discovered it was on damstraat (which is busy 24hrs and fairly noisy). At reception they could not find any record of booking, but offered us a twin room at 80e which was what we wanted. (they the next day did email my girlfriend to say they had found booking but wouldnt charge her-all good there). we got lift up to top floor where room was, alarm bells rang when in the corridor there was evidence of paint work (masking tape round fixtures and fittings) although it was a terrible job and no smell of paint- like it had been this way for quite a while. Anyhow you dont sleep in the corridors so not really to bothered. the room is a differnt matter and why i have given place such a poor rating. I didnt expect much, and got even less. The walls were covered in stains, dirty marks, general filth- if they had been painted or cleaned in past 15years i would be stunned. Window plane was missing and a patch work card and tape job had been done- due to this it was not warm. Curtains had suspect white stain and had a letter \"j\" marked on them in tomato sauce (i almost wet myself laughing at that and got a pic or two of it). Floor was filthy, didny even want to touch bed side table etc as it was disgusting. Beds had seen better days about a decade ago, and given the general state of room i decided to sleep fully clothed on top of it. Bathroom was acually ok, and looked clean. Me and my brother did expect much given time/price/location however we both found the place to be so bad that it was funny. Kind of made me think of the kind of seedy hotel that rented rooms by the hour rather than night although it isnt. At time i felt lucky to get room but in hindsite i wish we had slept at airport.

It is relatively cheap, the staff were very welcoming and helpful with their recommendations, and there is a nice Italian restaurant in the building (although you have the whole Damstraat with places to eat, the choices are endless). Most of the guests were young couples and groups of friends, and also on the street around the hotel there was an atmosphere of \"the party goes on\"... We liked it very much... The room was relatively spacious and they cleaned it every day... Now the less positive: if you want a central location, there is a price to that: the street is very busy till the latest night hours, so if you want to get some sleep, the windows must be kept closed. Also a hairdryer would be a nice addition. The room itself was clean, but the curtains really need some laundry...

It is within walking distance of most tourist spots and saves a small fortune on trams and the like if you decide to walk. The hotel itself has it's own pizzeria beneath it with a varied menu which is very handy if you do not want to venture far for lunch/dinner. Breakfast is also served in the same restaurant in the mornings. I must admit that it is very expensive to opt for breakfast but it is that way everywhere you look, especially considering it is very basic - cereals/toast/coffee/tea/juice/. I found it very handy however and it avoided my having to go round every morning looking for other equally expensive breakfasts. The hotel per se was clean; both the common areas and the room itself. The hotel is served with a lift which is handy considering the exceptionally steep and small steps Amsterdam has. The reception is manned by multi-lingual staff 24 hours a day who are always ready to help out and speak a multitude of languages. I only had one dodgy receptionist in my whole week there. Moving on to the hotel room. I had a single room, which was absolutely tiny. There is no other way to describe it but tiny. If you open out your hands, you can touch both walls on either side of its width. The bed was also on the small side, in the corner of the room and not on the comfortable side. The room also contained a small wardrobe but one would have to leave the luggage in the middle of the room if it is quite a sizeable luggage. That meant that I had to lift the luggage on to the bed to get to the other side of the room. The only complaint apart from size is that like all other buildings in Amsterdam, the walls seem to be paper thin, and you can hear nearby rooms' doors slam during the night. I only had one problem with the noise in the evening from a demonstration taking place at Dam Square all night but that cannot be remedied by the hotel management. The room had its own bathroom. Small but very practical. I had a problem with the sink as it was leaking and flooding the bathroom every time I opened the tap. I phoned reception to send someone to fix it which they did a couple of hours later. When that didn't solve the problem, they offered to change my room or change the base of the sink (which they did). All in all, despite the tiny and very bland looking room (it reminded me of a prison cell and I had a room overlooking a wall), I would stay at the Dora Hotel again and recommend it. Location trumps all other factors as it is at the centre of it all, unless you are after d\u00c3\u00a9cor and the luxuries.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ramat Gan, Israel", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel at a great location. Not for the disabled though.\u201d", "Author": "pilot1200", "ReviewID": "UR114527809", "Content": "The Location ------------------------ Hotel Doria is placed at Damstraat 3, right next to Dam square. It's about 10 min walk from the central station (walking along the Damrak avenue), and right next to the red light district. There's a tram station 50-80m away from the hotel, and another one just past the royal palace (which is located at Dam square). As the street (Damstraat) is just next to the red light distreect, and is hosts many restaurants and snack places, it is full of people at the evenings (and nights), probably people visiting the red light district, or just looking for a night snack. The hotel surroundings are very lively at night, and if you like it, you'll enjoy this hotel, being close to all that. If, however, you like a quiet night, hotel Doria isn't the hotel for you. The hotel ------------------------ Hotel Doria is a very basic hotel. Some might even say, it is more a two star hotel rather than three. The rooms are very small. The one we stayed at (room #110, pictures attached) was about 3m X 4m, *including* the bathroom (I'm attaching pictures so you can see for yourselves). There are two single beds (which can be joined together), but only 30-40cm spare to the sides of the beds. One side has a wooden rack you can place your keys/cellphone on. The other side have nothing near the bed, so you can't even put your glasses near the bed (only one can). There is a tiny wooden cabinet (something like 50cm by 50cm, 140cm tall), and a very small desk. The only place you can open your luggage is near the door (or on the beds, but then when you want to use the bed, you'll have to close and store it near the door). The bathroom features a shower and a toilet, it's quite clean and towels are changed daily. There's a dispencer filled with soap at the shower, and another one near the sink. The bathroom is very small, and it is not comfortable to use the toilet, or to change in. There is no mini bar, nor an air condition (I wouldn't stay there during the summer when it's hot), or a safe deposit box. There's a small 12inch TV, an alarm clock back from the Eighties, and a desk fan, all are connected to the single power outlet in the room, via a 4-way power outlet splitter. This is not the most comfortable room to stay at. Very claustrophobic. There is a soda vending machine near the reception, as well as a shared microwave oven, a fridge, and a desktop computer connected to the internet for everyone to use. Safes are also avilable near the reception (it isn't at a locked room, rather in the 'looby'). There are also some electric kettles and a pressing iron which I guess that guests can borrow and use. The staff is very nice and helpful. The receptionists always tried to help and they all talk good English. The breakfast is very basic. It well get your day started, but the selection isn't too exciting. It is important to mention, that this hotel is not accessible for disabled or limited people. Reaching the ground floor of the hotel requires climbing 8 stairs, and accessing the restaurant (for breakfast) requires further stairs climbing. The hotel elevator reaches the 4th floor, however there are five floors, and the fifth floor is only reachable... via the stairs. So if you're somewhat limited with mobility, this hotel might not be the one for you. Summary ------------------------ Hotel Doria is a very basic hotel, at a premium location. It does not fit people with disability or mobility limitation, as it requires being able to climb up and down the stairs. Its facilities are poor, and the rooms (surely the one we were at) are tiny and claustrophobic. However, it is priced accordingly, and it is right at the center of Amsterdam, so its value-for-money ratio is great.

Location was great, but for 80 Euro/night there has to be something better.", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cnice location, terrible staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4398380", "Content": "I and three friends stayed at this excellently located hotel, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist named Robin who showed us our rooms. The rooms were tiny and impossible to move around in, if you ever walked two steps you either bump into a bed, a wall, or at other times, forced into the bathroom, which itself was only the walk in type. The lice under the bed were most uncomfortable and the scratching from the walls at night was frightening. The blankets are throwovers, the unwashable type which cusomer after customer shares, this was obvious from the smell, which is why i slept using my jacket as a blanket. This hotel includes a breakfast, so I was shocked to see that the 'breakfast' consisted of a slice of toast, apple juice and a boiled egg, it was then I knew we had been stitched up. The staff, especially the night receptionist and head waiter were ruder than I could have imagined, throwing the food bills and plates of food on our table, insulting customers in their private language. That said, the manager was most apologetic and as a condolence, he offered us a 'Doria hotel' shirt to which we duly refused. If you are not into filthy and small rooms, with rude staff, then avoid this place at all costs.", "Date": "January 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but horrible room\u201d", "Author": "TheCoopersYWG", "ReviewID": "UR3558860", "Content": "Booked this hotel from the airport for 80 euros a night, location was great, located at the 'dam' and the restaurant beneath it is good.

The bed was uncomfortable and the paint was peeling off the walls, We cancelled our second night, and there were no problems, they even offered to store our bags in the lockers on site until we were done out tour.
