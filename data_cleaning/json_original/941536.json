{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice place just off jl poppies 1 AP Inn is a nice little hotel located just of poppies lane 1 in central kuta. The hotel features spacious clean rooms with somewhat basic furniture. Facilities include air-con, fridge, and a bathroom with a tub. The location is a bit difficult to reach by car, which is common in this part of town. It is possible to drive right up to the hotel however, and it has a few parking spaces too. There is a good size pool with this hotel, and also a nice poolside bar serving various drinks. Included (set) breakfast is served at the hotels restaurant. Breakfast options include both local and continental, and the food is of good quality.", "Date": "Jan 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR773065414", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Ben2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d941536-r12476726-AP_Inn-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "941536", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
