Now I used to sell mattresses for a living. The ones at this place are harder than anything I ever sold. If you want to try the feeling out go and take the mattress off your box spring and lay down on the box spring, if you have a platform bed just lay on the platform it will be close. The next major issue is an odd one the room has heat or ac depending on the time of the year. We had mild temps and did not need either with the windows (balcony door) closed the room became very stuffy at night with the door open it was very noisy. last issue is another odd one, the WIFI it was very poor and dropped very often. i spoke to the desk about the issue and they insisted they used and outside service and everything was good. In the lobby the wifi SSID was the same as our room but in the lobby a web site came up and required a username and password. Our room on the 3rd floor had no logon screen at all but very poor connectivity. There is a hardwired IBM laptop in each room and you can request a mouse if you don't like using a touchpad. I would bring my own wireless router in the future. The other issue i had was there is a glass shelf in the shower to hold the soap and your shampoo bottles. This shelf was loose and came down on the instep of my foot. if it hit lower or i was older I have no doubt it would have broken a bone in my foot. it looks like this http://www.thefurniture.com/store/images/DreamLine/shower_enclosures_columns/shcm-2648.jpg The person at the lobby that I brought the shelf too asked if I needed a doctor and i said no that was the last i heard from the hotel. The good Hotel location is great we could walk to most anywhere we wanted and mass transit is close too! breakfast buffet was 1/2 price 2 for 15 Euros. Which is a pretty good price, the buffet is your standard scrambled eggs, muffins rolls some lunch type meats sausage and fresh fruit. The coffee is a bit odd there is a coffee maker that offers Espresso, Cappuccino, and Cafe Americano. You can't get a cup of black coffee? The room itself was nice and the closet space is OK, bathroom was OK but the fan in the bathroom was not working at all so the bathroom steamed up when we took a shower. The staff was OK but their English was OK but don't ask questions too technical.

The hotels are in a square on the resulting space at the back holds hundreds of children and I can't begin to tell you what the noise is like. In the evening there are youth clubs with football etc so still noisy then, on the negative side they start very early. The windows/doors are very good and you will be shocked when opening them!

I stayed with my husband and two kids for two nights as a follow on to a med cruise. The hotel looked great and ultra modern in the photos but was a disappointment in reality. The children were actually scared of the hotel's creepy atmosphere and dark corridors. Our room was modern, but absolutely tiny and it backed onto a school playground/nursery. With all of our luggage and the children there was not room to swing a cat. The bathroom seemed to be bigger than the living and bedroom space . I lay down on the bottom of two bunk beds and bashed my head on some kind of hook protruding from the wall - very child friendly! When I considered the top bunk, I realised that there was no safety rail for my 12 year old - nothing to stop her from falling out in her sleep. I phoned reception and they sent up a porter who demonstrated that the ladder could be removed and turned sideways along the bed to create a makeshift safety rail. The lad seemed quite pleased with himself until I pointed out that she could now not get down to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, and that she would have to wake us all up to get down for any reason. After more phone calls and after being told that the hotel was full, and the absence of another ladder anywhere in the hotel, we were moved to a bigger room, which looked like a converted conference room with twin single beds and a pull down double which was very uncomfortable. The shower had jets, but if you put them on they soaked the floor - stylish but not practical. All in all a bad experience. This is not a family hotel at all, there is no atmosphere to the place and as my daughter says it is a good hotel for Dracula!", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucester", "Title": "\u201cHotel was ok, location a bit too far out for me\u201d", "Author": "Glos1983", "ReviewID": "UR16349801", "Content": "Me and my partner went to Barcelona for his 30th.

They give you a book of barcelona with all the metro lines and places to go which helped us so much! The rooms were nicely decorated but the beds were two twins pushed together that were on wheels? Also mattresses very hard, free internet was nice but i didnt use it. The only english speaking channel with the TV is CNN but with so much to do i dont think that should be a major issue. Was disapointed with the location of the hotel had to walk a fair trek to get to the Ramblas and other attractions but if you like walking or prepared to use the metro then this hotel will be fine, we stayed in room 302 on the third floor at the front of the hotel and it was very noisy in the morning with traffic but i dont think you will escape this in barcelona. Rooms cleaned everyday, new towels, mini bar well stocked but very expensive but isnt it in every hotel?

Charming receptionist, very modern decor (mostly black). The bedroom had a very comfortable double bed (2 single bases) and pull-down bunk beds behind a diaphanous curtain. The room was small, and one side of the bed was right up against the shower room (opaque glass) wall, but it was spotlessly clean and well designed, with plenty of storage space, a safe and a fridge. The shower was state-of-the-art with 3 different sprays including massage jets. In common with other reviewers, we found the room noisy because it was on the inside overlooking the central square which is a sports and play area, in constant daily use. However, all the players go home eventually, and don't start again until just before 08.00. The only real downside to this hotel was the breakfast. They charge 15 euros, and after the first day we just gave up on it and went to BraCafe on the next corner, for the best coffee in the world. The hot buffet was cold, they ran out of fresh fruit, and the drinks machine was broken for the entire 3 days we were there. The staff just said \"tomorrow\" and did not offer to bring coffee from the kitchen.

The room itself was big enough and the massive double bed that we had gave us as much enjoyment as the kids got from their bunkbeds. If there was a DVD player we didnt find it. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. The main drawback was the breakfast, which is set in a dark basement floor and cost a ridiculous \u20ac50 a day for the family (adults \u20ac15 each, kids \u20ac10 each) we gave it a miss after day one and just went somewhere local for a quarter of the price.

The hotel staff were beyond helpful with every request, even when we needed emergency dental treatment - the receptionist 'phoned her boss & we got to see his dentist straight away.
