We were terrified of our rooms, one opened up onto a scary patio/window-well packed with trash, and then other had a barred window at sidewalk level.

Problems- In order of importance: When we checked in at front desk the staff gave us a credit card slip to sign- which had a 5% surcharge fee included by them. I questioned that we reserved (booked) via easytobook and that on the booking confirmation we had made there was no mention of extra 5 percent (I showed them the print out of the webpage booking concerned) They matter of factly said- we have to take it up the easyto book- i.e it was not their (the hotels) problem and that it was their (the hotel's) policy to add this booking charge(very unhappy- but had to sign the credit slip as we needed the room obviously- ((only 15.00 euros more- but it was on principal I complained) Spoke to another couple at breakfast who went via another agent- the hotel charged them the extra too- they were not happy as it didn't say about the 5 percent on that agents order page either. I escalated it and said I wanted the owner/manager to explain- the staff said he would tell us the same thing. We were also very unhappy with the room they provided- we booked a two bed room and they gave us a room with three camp beds in it- not proper beds- but just rickety camp beds one that occasionally collapsed. The fact there was three camp beds meant there was only a tiny space to walk around in the room. The room was very dirty also -the floor didn't look cleaned and the bed spreads were grubby and dead bugs next to the wall. No soap in the room either. dust over most things and holes all over the curtains. For our stay there they completely forgot to clean and service our room. No hoovering. Breakfast- while the selection of food was great- ( no complaints there) the water for the tea making had bugs and dust floating on the surface- changed once I pointed it out.The plates were also dirty as were virtually all the cups- the milk jugs were caked in old milk too- hadn't been washed for a while. A side issue- was that on the De lanternes webpage- it says all 28 rooms have private facilities including showers -toilets etcs- not the case- many rooms have shared bathrooms- on arrival at the hotel we had to actually almost kick and push the front door open as it was jammed- when we eventually got in- the receptionist gave us an ear bashing saying there was no problem with the door- after our 15 hour flight I explained that both my wife and I had tried it but it wouldn't open- she held firm saying the door was fine- (good start) Due to stress on the part of my wife- she asked me to promise not to make a scene and complain- she wanted to let the problems go- ( I said I would take it up with easytobook on my return) I would be grateful to hear your views on the hotel and whether you think they deserve a place in your listings-\" again the agents reply was can't upload the review for technical reasons-", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo,Brazil", "Title": "\u201cPlease, go somewhere else!!\u201d", "Author": "Deko85", "ReviewID": "UR60758365", "Content": "Yes, I know I was traveling throughout Europe with not so much money, but I regret every penny I saved staying at this hotel...If I had stayed somewhere else paying twice as much, I would not have regretted it and I would surely have been more satisfied.

Stairs are steep, you have to climb either 33, 49, 65 or 81 steep steps to reach your room. For the price I paid I cannot complain really. Room had new nice curtains, small TV with lots of channels and I could plug my headphone in for good sound. Large low bed, not too comfortable mattress but OK. Good furniture, looked new. Window could open but you have to do it yourself, the knob does not work. Small bathroom, but clean. I think it will get hot in there in summer but they will have ventilators. There were stains on the carpet but not their fault that they get such dirty guests. At the entrance are boxes for your valuables so the ones who complained about stealing could have prevented it, IF it really happened. It costs 20 Euro but you get it back. Also 10 Euro for the keycard which you get back at checkout. Good breakfast, nothing less than what everyone eats at home normally, but no yoghurt. Nice terrace at the canal. No phones in room (but everyone has cell phones nowadays), no minibar, a very small desk, one chair. This is not a bad hotel, but it IS for backpackers or people not used to real luxury. If you expect too much, go elsewhere and don't pay more than say 60 Euro, otherwise it is too much. Do a good search at booking sites like www.booking.com and if you find this hotel to be the cheapest (like me) and you need that, then you will be OK. I was only disturbed by young people screaming outside all night, but that's not their fault. A room on the front is best as the back is towards Leidseplein and 20 meters from Melkweg. They have no real luggage room but I left mine in the reception and that was fine. You can reach the hotel by going on tram 1,2 or 5 from Central Station, get off at Leidseplein, walk round the theatre and then it is at the canal, about 300 meters.

The Van Gogh Museum is also about 15 min walk and the Rijksmuseum. You will be in a place called Liedesplein which is like a mini slice of London's West End in the evening, there are some very good restaurants, (fantastic greek restaurant called Mykonos) and bars and clubs if that's what you're looking for. It's incredibly easy to get around, 5 minutes from the hotel the tram service will connect you to many places around amsterdam. It takes around 15 minutes to Central Station, and a further 15 to Schipol airport. The staff are very friendly and helpful, little problems were attended to, i.e.to change a light bulb, needing more towels etc. The breakfast is certainly fine to get you started for your day. It's a 'help-youself' service to toast, a selection of preservatives, boiled eggs, slices of cheese, ham, coffee, tea. You can have as much as you wish. Lovely views of the canals from the bedroom window, there is also a locker service to put your passports, valuables in for a deposit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 (refundable) which is worth using.

We were crammed in 6 persons to a room at a rate of 55 Euros per person meaning 330 Euros per room per night (We could have gotten a 4 starfor that money rather than this cess pit). The rooms were so small that 6 beds could not actually fit so there were at least 2 mattresses on the floor in each room crammed inbetween the beds with absolutley no other floor space. There were no wardrobes or draws so each persons bag had to stay on their bed even whilst sleeping. This meant that you had to climb over other mattresses/beds to reach your own. We had a party of 23 people and as we arrived at 8pm on a Friday night there was no real opportunity to argue as we were never going to find anywhere else for that many people at such short notice. The bathrooms walls were covered in mould, windows did not lock (we were at street level and in the basement, both of which could easily be accessed from outside), the barbed-wire covered balcony was a nice touch. On the second day a number of guys decided to find somehere else and so left the hotel. The manager insisted that they had to pay for the second night even though they were not staying and then blocked everyone else's room cards until the money was paid. After several hours of arguing they finally agreed to reinstate the cards. However, since we have returned home my credit card has been charged by the hotel claiming that we still owe for the guys who did not stay but they actually charged an extra approx 50%. I lodged a formal complaint to the booking agents asking the hotel to justify this charge but they simply replied with a number of false claims against us including that we had urinated over our beds and floor and stole all of the room cards, both complete lies. They offered no justification for the extra cost and point blank refused to cancel the charge.... The booking agents have become so embarressed by the whole debacle that they have actually paid me the additional charge back out of their own pockets. The manager of the agency has said that they have been using this hotel without any serious problems for years but that new management has taken over in the past few months and that there have been non-stop issues ever since.
