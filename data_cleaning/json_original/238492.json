Cannot recommend Hotel Madrid enough. It's set in a little cobbled side street, with lots of lovely restaurants nearby. Hotel arranged airpot pick up to and from the airport too which was great.

Claustophobic lift, antiquated TV sets, no wi-fi connection in rooms, no working mini-bar, broken toilet cistern.To this I may add the lack of porter assistance, the noise from passers-by and scooters from the street below, the absolute minimal hotel reception lobby etc. Unique pleasant feature of this establishment is the breakfast room on the roof terrace with commanding views of the famous Roman terraces and the cupola of St. Peters' Cathedral in the distant background. Conclusion: This is a \"sleep and go\" hotel.If one wants to walk the very heart of the historic center of Rome for shopping or cultural therapy, in good sunshine weather, so that rain does not force you in the room, this place will do. If one is not fussy about facilities, frills and charm , this place will do, too.

I booked the Hotel via venere website (but I noticed I would have received a cheaper rate if I just booked on the hotel website). Anyway, I was nervous about this hotel because of some of the reviews. I e-mailed them in advance and confirmation directly from the hotel was received. Our transfer limo driver easily found the hotel and was able to drop us off at the front door. The limo driver remarked to us that we picked a hotel with a perfect location. The gentleman working the desk helped us move our luggage from the van into the hotel by the desk and then helped us move the luggage to the elevator (much appreciated!). We checked in at 11:00am (early) and the room was ready. Check in was easy and quick. The elevator to the room worked well (we were on the 3rd floor), with a nice large bed. I was impressed at first glance with the bathroom and bedroom (roomy and clean, no foul odor). It was hot in the room when we first arrived so we closed the windows and turned on the AC which worked fine. Also, the safe was a nice touch and it worked fine too. Bathroom was beautiful and shower pressure was fine (I read another comment that stated poor water pressure which was not the case). Plenty of nice hot water for a long shower. Couldn't find any evidence of mold, dirt or anything to complain about at all. Nice size desk, armoire with 10 hangers. There were no drawers or dressers so we basically just kept everything folded in our suitcases and lived out of them. Also no alarm clock but a working phone and the front desk does wake up calls as needed. Hotel is nice and quiet (which I was worried about because last time I was in Rome I stayed on via del corso which was very loud!!). Also thick curtains help to block out sunlight if you want to sleep in, or they can be pulled back for light. I had read a review that rooms were small so I made sure to book the double superior which was a perfect size!! The price was normal for a big city, and it is similar to other hotels in the area. You are staying in an area with a perfect location for sightseeing and by all the high end shopping (and very safe). If you want a cheap hotel (like near the train station), you are going to pay in other ways (lack of safety, not being able to go outside at night....). Also, there is a minibar in the room with prices listed on the desk. Maid service did a good job. TV is small and English stations were CNN international and MTV. Wi-fi available in lobby area. Breakfast was served 7am-10am in the morning buffet style, and consisted of fruit, pasteries, cereal, yogurt, eggs (scrambled and hard boiled), french toast and bacon. Also assorted juices, water and coffee was available. So yummy, perfect breakfast!! Probably the best free breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. The view from the roof-top terrace is nice and you can see St. Peters. Although, there is a picture that someone took of the view from the window to St. Peters, but it is misleading (I think they zoomed in alot for there picture, the Basilica isn't actually that close). We walked alot to different places in Rome. For shopping Via Condotti and Via Del Corso are within minutes walking and then you can walk to other sites like Spanish Steps (5 minutes), Colesseum (25 minutes), Forum/Circus Maximus (30 minutes), Vatican (40 minutes). Cab ride to Vatican was 10 euros from hotel so we decided to walk afterwards back to the hotel. It was a pleasant walk passing Castle Sant Angelo and crossing the river. Make sure if you need a transfer/taxi to the airport you only accept a flat rate of 40 euro. I think that the hotel driver charges 50 euros. Oh- and make sure that if you are taking a direct flight back to the US they drop you off at terminal T5 at the airport (new terminal for direct Israel and US flights). Plenty of bars and restaurant within 5 minutes walking from hotel. My overall impression is that it was a good hotel to stay at and I would stay there again. It is an old building but everything was clean (i.e. no rotting wood, no stains on walls, no ragged carpet). In other words, the building doesn't show signs of its age. It was alot of money to stay there but you are paying for location, safety and a good hotel in a large city. I have paid similar prices for far less charming hotels. I rated it a 4 because I thought it was very good for a 3 star hotel. I would say if you are going for more business interests or looking for complete luxury to stay elsewhere. This is just the perfect charming hotel for a stay in Rome.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAll in all good\u201d", "Author": "SydV3", "ReviewID": "UR45925295", "Content": "Nice rooms, nice and helpful staff and brilliant location.

The hotel staff even helped us book sight-seeing tours through an outside agency. The tour agency came to the hotel to pick us up and dropped us off at the end. The continental breakfast is served each morning on the roof-top terrace overlooking the city of Rome. What better way to start off your day! The only draw back to this charming hotel is the fact that you have to climb multiple stairs to reach your room or the roof-top terrace. The hotel's elevator only fits 2 people at a time (or your luggage) and it was much quicker and faster to just take the stairs.

We had a suite for four people which we booked online with the hotel directly. We had a good sized double room and a separate adjoining twin room for the kids. The room was kept very clean and we didn\u2019t find the noise a problem as we shut the shutters inside and out and kept the air conditioning units on in both rooms. The breakfast was good but it is best to get there early so you have more choice of pastries. We had very good bruschetta on Sunday morning! They ask you if you would like a drink from the bar, and so we ordered cappuccinos which are included in the price. The hotel gives you a very good map of Rome which we found invaluable as it was very detailed. We had heard from reviews on Trip Advisor that there is a 10% discount if you pay in cash, but the hotel staff were a bit vague for a few days about whether we could have this discount or not, but after checking with the manager it was all agreed and this was not a problem. The hotel is perfectly placed for loads of good bars and restaurants and is only a few minutes walk away from the Spanish Steps. We also walked to the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon and up the Piazza del Popolo, where there are great views over the city if you walk up to the Pincio. We did walk a bit further to Piazza Navona which is a lovely square full of nice bars and restaurants and lots of painters selling their pictures. We would recommend a restaurant called Zio Ciro (part of a chain) which is up the road first right as you come out of the hotel entrance. This was the only restaurant we could find that did cheap house wine in a carafe rather than in a bottle. It was 5 Euros for a half litre carafe and the food was good too. We got taxis to the Colosseum and the Vatican to save our kids from moaning and these were reasonably priced. It was very easy to get a taxi as there were taxis parked in Piazza Miganelli just up from the hotel. You can also get taxis near the Spanish Steps and they are waiting for you outside the Vatican museum. If you get to the Colosseum early enough you can just walk straight in with hardly any queue, we got there for 9am but it actually opens at 8.30am. We booked our tickets to the Vatican museum online and this saved us from having to queue up outside the museum, you just walk straight in. But you do still have to queue up to exchange your voucher for tickets at the ticket desks (there are priority ones for online bookings) but the queues here were very small. I would recommend climbing the dome at St Peter\u2019s as this was great fun for the kids. Just follow the signs for the Cupola when you are in the queue for St Peters.

We had one of the family suites, double bed in one room, twin beds in the other room for our 2 boys (14 and 10). The rooms were not huge, but perectly adequate. The bathroom was a good size with a lovely shower and plenty of big fluffy towels & shower gel/soap. We were grateful for the air conditioning as it was very hot during our stay. This also blocked out the street noise in the evening, along with closing the shutters & windows. The hotel was in a great location, down a narrow side street & just a short stroll to the Spanish Steps & Metro, & also not far from the Trevis Fountain. Just 2 stops on the Metro to Ottiviana for St Peters, and the other way, via Termini Station, to the Colesseum. We flew into Fumicini airport & took the train to Termini station where we picked up the Metro to Spagna. The hotel is just a few minutes walk. There are 2 trains an hour from the airport, and the journey takes about 30mins. The cost is 11 euros each way (our 10 year old was free). Make sure you validate the ticket at the machines on the platform or you may be fined. The Metro tickets are 1 euro and valid for 75 mins. The reception staff at the hotel were all very friendly. We were able to check-in at around 1pm, and when leaving were able to leave our bags for collection later in the afternoon. Breakfast was fine, with a buffet of pastries, fruit, yoghurt, cold meat & cheese, cereals fruit juice & tea/coffee, served from 7 -10am. Plenty of restaurants close by for lunch or evening meals. Would highly recommend this hotel. One tip if visiting the Colesseum, get there early (before 10am) & buy your tickets from the Palantine about 5mins walk away. The ticket gives you access to both the Colesseum & Palatine, but much shorter queue at the latter. The ticket is valid for 2 days.

We choose the hotel based on the trip advisor ratings, especially the ones that discussed the family suites. It was ideal for us. We had booked the suite that slept 5 (even though there were only 4 - we thought it might give us a bit more space). The rooms were generous for Europe standards and there were two rooms with a door in between and one large bathroom with a nice big tub to soak in after a long day of walking around Rome. The bathroom was fairly new with plenty of nice big fluffy towels (I had been expecting the typical European flat towels). The rooftop breakfast was more than continental but less than English (there were some eggs and they would make you toast at the coffee counter as well but it was mainly fruit, fabulous warm pastries, yogurt, cereal, breads, meats and cheese). For us it was just right and it was so nice to sit there each morning and discuss your plans over our pastries and cappuccino while looking out over the rooftops of Rome. The location is really what made this hotel the perfect choice. We were just minutes away from the Spanish Steps and all the shopping. The Trevi Fountain was a stroll in the other direction. We walked over every evening just to wind down our day. The Metro stop is nearby to the left of the Spanish Steps, but honestly we walked almost everywhere. The walk to the Pantheon and the Collosium were easy as well. The only point of warning for very light sleepers, even though the windows are double paned you could hear the street noise at times. We came in on Saturday and it was very loud that evening (plus we were very tired) but that was the only night, Sunday and Monday we didn't hear a thing. It's not the hotel's fault, the windows are double paned and there are shutters you can close, but when you are right in the middle of everything you can't expect silence, there is a lot of foot traffic in this area. (My husband just brings along those disposable ear plugs.) The staff was very helpful with directions, recommendations and even making sure we had a bigger taxi to take us to the train station so that all four would fit with our bags.
