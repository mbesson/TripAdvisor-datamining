I found the hotel on Late Rooms and at \u00a360 it was the closest and best priced hotel I could find. I now wish that I had looked for a little longer... We checked in just after 2pm and we were greeted by the receptionist who took a copy of my driving license and wrote all my banks details down. He gave us our room key -111- and told us that we had to leave our room key on reception whenever we left the hotel. The room was very basic - only one pillow each, no duvet (just a thin sheet which doesnt keep you warm in November!), no signal on the tv. The shower head was just hanging down, there was no fitting to hold it to the wall - this resulted in my husband having to hold the shower head up above my head when we wanted to shower, not ideal! The view from our window was a dirty old mattress and what looked like used condoms that had been thrown out of guests windows. IT GETS A LOT WORSE - we left the hotel around 6pm for our evening out and handed our keys into reception as requested. We then arrived back to the hotel around 11pm and went to get our key from reception. When we told him we were in room 111 he asked if we were sure. He was then rummaging around, trying to find our key. Then he said that his brother who was working on the reception earlier had been drinking and had taken our key out with him!!! He gave us another room key and asked us to go and wait in there whilst he waited for his brother to return. We said no, that we would wait in the reception for him, which he wasnt happy with. He then disappeared and when he came back he said his brother should be 10 minutes. By this time we had been waiting in reception for around 30 minutes. He then said he would have to break into our room if we wanted our luggage (which obviously we did!) so off he disappeared with various tools. A few minutes later a man who we hadnt seen before came through reception and said that he was staying here also and assured us that no one had been in our room or touched our stuff. We thought this was weird as we didnt know who he was. Once he had broken into our room in we went - all our stuff seemed to be exactly as we left it, but then we went into the bathroom. There was water all over the toilet seat and on the floor and the hand towels were missing. My husband went ro reception to complain as someone had obviously been in our room. He didnt deny or confirm this but just apologised and gave us new towels! Then we decided to get into bed - when we lifted back the sheets we found what looked like some sort of belly button jewellry in the sheets! My husband went to complain again, and was told that it must of just got caught up in the dry cleaning! We did not feel safe at all in this hotel and seriously contemplated leaving and finding somewhere else to stay, but we just couldnt afford to fork out anymore on another hotel. We were awoken at 8.30am by the cleaner trying to get into our room, nice! Needless to say, we didnt stay for breakfast and we never did get our key back. PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE, it truly is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in and ruined our weekend.

First night: I was given a room without drapes/curtain and the room faced the busy main road. There was neither heating nor a duvet in the room on a freezing night and no locks on the door. The water from the broken down radiator leaked all over the pot-holed wooden floor making it a slip hazard. Not much point boring you about the state of the TV. When I politely requested a change of room or a plug-in heater from the man in charge at the reception that night, I was rudely told as follows: \"all rooms were occupied; there were no plug-in heaters; my room radiator would be fixed and curtains provided the next day\". His story was contradicted by their reception officer the following morning who was very certain that the hotel had spare plug-in heaters and promised to provide one and curtains in the room. Second night: I returned to discover absolutely nothing was done. The new officer on duty led me to believe that he cared when he actually inspected the room, acknowledged the room was not habitable and promised to bring me extra blankets and a heater in 15 minutes if he could not move me into another room within that time. When I went back to the reception after 30 minutes, I was told he had left for the day and did not mention the matter to anyone! His replacement reluctantly grabbed some room-type keys, disappeared for some minutes and returned with rumpled smelly blankets which he said he got from \"vacant rooms\". When I asked why he would not just move me into the vacant room, he changed tunes and said he took the blankets from the hotel laundry! I was made to sleep without heating or privacy second night running. Final night: Upon my return, an old plug-in heater eventually turned up. Curtains, drapes, door locks, radiator etc never got fixed. Not sure what was on the bed or when last the beddings were changed because I itched and scratched throughout the stay. Breakfast room was next to the Gents and when I picked up the table serviette, I found it had lipstick stains on it.
