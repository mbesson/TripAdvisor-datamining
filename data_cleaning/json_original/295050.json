It is well located just off Taksim Square so bus and metro services are on the doorstep. Staff were reasonably friendly and helpful, rooms appeared to be clean but the hotel has all the charm of a left luggage depot. When you walk in the door you just can't help feeling sad...and that is not the emotion I expect when first checking in...the lobby is depressing and the lack of lighting does nothing to help (half the area had no lights on at all). On the first floor the restaurant area is large and lack-lustre with lighting more appropriate to a bus station and certainly not somewhere anyone would want to sit for a meal. (which we had to the first day we arrived for lunch but after that we just ate out as we did not want to sit, on our own, in the empty dining room, particularly as there are so many great restaurants in the area). The standard rooms are long and narrow and felt quite claustrophobic - however the reception did offer us an alternative room on the 8th floor which was a lot better in term of light and there was a balcony outside which offered views over the town to the Bosphorus. (However we could not get out to it as it was locked). The bed unfortunately felt like it was made of straw and while the sheet fit the bed the duvet only came to the top edge of the mattress so luckily the heating worked as otherwise it would have been rather cold as the moment someone turned over in the bed..the duvet would stop covering you. The \"amenities\" offered in the room were a small bar of soap by the hand basin in the bathroom (and only when in the shower did it become apparent that it was the only piece of soap in the room !). The bathroom itself was small with no external ventilation. There was a tiny sewing kit in the desk drawer. The \"mini-bar\" had seen better days and needed a clean (both inside and around the cabinet) The room was carpeted but also felt a bit like straw underfoot. The lifts were rather small and dark and well worn..and the hallway carpets just looked like they needed replacing. There is a pool, sauna and hamman area in the basement..but it also seemed small, dark and well worn to the extent it almost seemed seedy...(plus there is a 10TL additional charge to use the sauna). The whole place has good bones...but the appearance of being managed by people with no interest in customer service.

Are you considering the possibility of staying at the Crystal? Listen to me: LOOK ELSEWHERE, and considered yourselves saved. I wish I had gone through the reviews earlier. It's harder to paint a more horrible picture than it has been painted in previous reviews, but believe me: I am an aged traveller. I have seen all sorts of hotels, from Cambodian holes to brothels. This join their ranks. When I arrived in Istanbul, on a business trip, I had made no bookings, so this was arranged for me last minute at the airport travel desk. I paid as much as Euro 150/night for a single room in the hotel and was happy I was awarded one of the better rooms. This turns up to be a disgustingly dirty room, with stained carpet flooring, and a smell that would have you throw up as you step in. The temperature is akin to that of a Turkish bath (so, I suppose, it would save you having to go through that experience), which makes it nearly impossible to sleep. The noise from the the street, from the nearby clubs and from the cars on Taksim square is enough to keep you awake all night. The service at the reception downstairs is awful and the hotel amenities are just plain ugly. The swimming pool at level -1 doubles, I believe, as the hotel sewage. The 'prestige' terrace on the 8th floor is home to abandoned pieces of furniture. The breakfast in the morning is a work of art - Tracy Emin could find inspiration for her next piece - as stuff that you never thought could be eaten finds its way on the main display. I pity those who, like me, come here after having paid the agency at the airport, for there's no turning back or having your money refunded so that you can move to a better location. If you are lucky enought to have a choice, you'd be a fool to be wanting to stay here. What I find even more irritating, reading other people's review, is that the hotel manager will stick a completely meaningless message after this post making you believe that you will be welcomed back to a rennovated hotel, which is all about 'prestige' and 'hello!'.

My wife and I have tried Boutique, Tourist and International style of venues in Sultanahmet, Tunel and Taksim districts. The Crystal is a newly refurbished \"four\" star tourist class hotel in the Taksim district. The venue was chosen for a large group of us to attend a family wedding. We were able to secure a good discount off the rack rate by booking through a third party agency. The hotel is located just off Cumhuriyet Caddesi, a stone's throw from Taksim Square. This provides an ideal base to explore Beyo\u00c4\u0178lu to the south and the more modern districts to the north. The trip to Sultanahmet is highly dependent on the traffic, however it should take no more than 40 minutes using the funicular and the tram. Another plus point is that the Airport Hava\u00c5\u0178 bus terminates 100 metres from the front door. No hotel in Istanbul will be ideally located for all the attractions but the Crystal's position is as good as any for the independent traveller, who doesn't want to depend on taxis. Check in was efficient. We had been allocated a twin room but this was easily switched to a double. Unfortunately we were allocated a tiny room with an even smaller window. I would recommend that you don't accept room 12 on any of the floors as they are not of 4* quality. We didn't make a fuss immediately as we were were trying to avoid offending the organisers but, after seeing the rooms allocated to our friends, we complained to the manager. He happily changed our room to larger one with a nice big window. The room rate includes en-suite bath or shower, use of the hotel pool that we didn't see, free wireless internet access and breakfast. The rooms are newly decorated, with minibar and an LCD television on the wall. The bed was firm and comfortable, the shower powerful - all as you would wish for at an establishment of this price. The bar was overpriced, as is every hotel bar in Istanbul and the breakfast uninspiring. In conclusion, I have stayed in better hotels in Istanbul with more character, but not for this price. It is not in the same league as The Bentley, The Intercontinental or The Divan (currently knocked down and waiting to be rebuilt) but is comparable to The Point. I would recommend The Crystal Hotel for a friend at the rate that we paid (less than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 per room per night) but not the published \u00e2\u201a\u00ac175 as listed at reception", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cGood value hotel in Taksim\u201d", "Author": "ruthL36", "ReviewID": "UR26693508", "Content": "Stayed for 8 nights while attending an event in Istanbul.

But the only downfall of the vacation was mostly the hotel. This hotel is a complete NO NO for people who like to lounge in a hotel all day or expect to sun bath in the medit. sun; Firstly let me start by saying, that not all the previous reviews were right, when i arrived at my hotel i was greeted warmly by a bell man called mourad, then was shown to two suites, situated on the 8th and 9th floor (9th floor only accessible by stairs or taking the lift to the 8th and clambering over 30+ steps). Upon arrival the rooms we're airy and bright, but not of the 4* rating it maintained. The real definition of a 4* hotel is have a specific size of room which is around 5m squared less than a 5* hotel; and come to think of it, was more than 3/4 missing. Yet it must have fully working TV with a working remote controller, a fridge that is well ventilated to prevent over-heating, fresh clean towels per day and more to add, the towels must also coincide with the number of people living in this cave. We were 5 people and 3 towels were laid out in the disgraceful toilet, ordered more and left to tour the city, came back and didn't find any floor towels, nor hand towels but found 5 large towels, so there playing the game of substitution. Further the more, the A/C is claimed to be 'fully controllable' from your room, but nope the hotel switches off the A/C from 10am till 6pm?? And what more is that they push there luck even more but not supplying the fully A/C power available, for god sake if if i was to blow over my children it would have been better. Almost forgot there were a couple of power surges and then the generators kicked in, the gennys kept working for about 3-4 hours, and to top everything off, is that this was all at around 12:30 midnight and you couldn't sleep till 4am and had to cancel our planned trip due to a lack of sleep and rest. The breakfast is completely stomach churning and uneatable, the eggs look aged, the omelets aren't freshly made, the bread is availible in certain amounts, the water is provide in shot glasses, the 'fresh' orange juice is more like, preserved orange powder with added water and tonnes of sugar, the salads look soggy and harmful. the only best thing about this hotel is the balcony on the 8th floor, but this balcony was stated as a night cafe offering refreshing drinks and food at night, but nothing was offered, no tables laid, nothing. The view depending on where my room was situated was mind blowing, i had a clear view of the bosphorus bridge and sea along with the ill rejected hyatt, intercontinental and ritz. (the only reason i stayed in this dump [The crystal hotel] was that there were no rooms allocated for me on the dates required). The location of the hotel is quite appealing aswell, its only a 20meters away from the subway, which takes you to istanbuls shopping districts and a majority of the touristic attractions and hotspots. Its also a 2 min walk (timed) from the istaklal street with designer shops from lacoste to diesel. and a 15 min walk from the super rich 'Mecca street' with ultra-designer shops like Louis Vuitton, Beymen, Burberry etc. (Louis Vuitton is a must, bought a wallet, bag and glasses, the very best). So Basically, this is a complete no no as i said for hotel loungers, but yet its okay for people who'll be all over istanbul touring and sightseeing. This hotel should be renamed the rock or the stone not The Crystal as i cannot see the clarity of this hotel.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cBad experince at the Crystal Hotel\u201d", "Author": "timothy08", "ReviewID": "UR18489237", "Content": "we stayed at the crystal hotel an 29th july 08 and found most of the staff impolite.

The front desk informed us that they shut off all A/C units b/c people were complaining that it was too cold!! (??? what?!!) The 12-inch TV was at least 40 years old with limited channels. The bathroom was decent but there were all sort of hair on the floor, if you catch my drift! (yuck) and the tub was old with mold on the edges. The only good thing about the bathroom was the unbelievable water pressure in the shower and the clean towels. For a 4-star hotel, the sheets should be impeccable and changed everyday. However, one of our beds had sheets which were stained with something brown/black. The breakfast buffet was very good. They had all sorts of meats, eggs, fruits, yogurts, bread, vegetables, etc. The only problem we had the whole time we were there is the staff. They were not organized and very very rude. I was shocked!!!! I think this hotel was misadvertised as a 4-star hotel. I blame our travel agent who encouraged us to stay there and guaranteed our satisfaction. Word of advice, believe the other reviews about this hotel...Most hit the nail on the head. Other people on our tour stayed at Larespark Hotel (down the street from Crystal) and they loved it. Divan Hotel, Nippon, and Boutique Hotels were praised (all in Taksim close to Crystal). Holiday Travel promised us a 3-day tour, but we arrived to find out there are none. We joined a different travel group and had an amazing time. Istanbul was fabulous, so rich with history and culture.

We understood later from other visitors that there is quite a difference beteween the floors: The lower floors contained much smaller rooms, and it was noisy as well. on the 5th floor the noise was noticable only when the window was open, but that's a reasonable price to pay for being so close to the center. The breakfast was exactly the same each day (from the 8 days we were there), and it wasn't so good. but, from cheking the cafes nearby, that is the turkish breakfast everywhere. the staff was generally kind and spoke english (a rare thing in turkey). in sum- good value for money.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "salonika", "Title": "\u201cunacceptable!\u201d", "Author": "ist2007", "ReviewID": "UR7303790", "Content": "When we arrived the roommaid has just closed the door of our room and we thought we will find it clean.

I bought chlorine water from a market and i cleaned the bathroom. Its not my business but its my hygiene and healthy! Windows were dirty, in the ceiling-roof has humidity from upstairs bathroom i think, the next rooms greet the ears when they had bath and the best i ve listened was that the alarm ball in the center of ceiling-roof was secret camera for the hotel safety!!!
