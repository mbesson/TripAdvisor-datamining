The staff was very accommodating and helpful, especially when it came to directions and transportation. The breakfast was delicious. I enjoyed my lattes every morning and my daughter loved her hot chocolate. We were celebrating my daughter's 18th birthday, and on our first day, one of the staff sang Happy Birthday when we sat down in the breakfast room. The staff was very attentive at breakfast keeping the buffet replenished and the tables cleared and set for the next diners. The hotel was immacuIate. A lot of attention was paid to keeping it clean. I enjoyed the different art work in the hotel and actually spent some time looking at it on all the floors. Venice is an old city so I did not expect or want to stay in a modern hotel.

On arrival, the receptionist was very helpful and we were able to check in a couple of hours earlier than expected, which was appreciated after the early rise to travel. The room was also upgraded, overlooking the canal. The room itself, was ok, slightly smallish, but this didn't matter, as how long are you going to spend in your hotel room when there is Venice to explore on your doorstep?! The bathroom was lovely, very modern, nicely tiled and the shower was excellent - the actual shower cubicle was massive! If you do have a room with a canal view, don't expect it to be quiet in the mornings, there is always something going on outside, as everything happens by boat - whether it is a grocery/flower delivery or even building maintenance. But at least a refreshing change from not having to see cars or buses! The lift was out of order when we arrived, but we only had hand-luggage and only located 2 floors up, so wasn't an inconvenience. We also had a complimentary bottle of Prosecco left in our room, after a day out, which was a nice surprise. We are still unsure what the 'sorry for the inconvenience' was for? Can only assume it was for the lift? Anyway, we drank it and it went down very nicely. The breakfast was sufficient - various cereals, cheese, eggs, bacon, yoghurts, breads and loads of CAKES!! Shame there wasn't a toaster, but we got around that. The coffee and juice wasn't very good, which was a disappointment for Italy. We sampled the Happy Hour (between 6pm and 7pm) A great idea to have some snacks provided whilst you have a drink. The Barmen were very hospitable and friendly.

The hotel entrance is in a very narrow walkway so thankfully we had our tour guide to lead us there. Interestingly enough there was a Hell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kitchen Wine Bar directly off the lobby. The hotel has a canal entrance that was used for service, baggage handling for tours and water taxi pick up.

It had a toilet and bidet which faced each other with only about eight inches clearance between the two. They had to be passed to reach the shower. We were on the fifth floor and I would say our room technically did not have a view but we could see out over the tiled rooftops to the clock tower in the piazza and the dome of St. Marks.

We arrived late, and the directions were terrible. The hotel is not on San Marco itself, but in a back alley that was hard to find. When we asked others for assistance, no one seemed to know where the hotel was and were actually pretty rude about it. When we finally arrived however, we received keys to a 5th floor room which was tiny, old, dirty, and disgusting. I had heard that hotel standards in Italy were not of the same standard as those anywhere else, but I was not ready for what we saw. As soon as we checked in, we found roaches in the room. The furniture was falling apart and the bathroom was tiny and not exactly what I would consider clean. Showering for anyone over 100 lbs would be impossible and the floor flooded if you even tried. We were switched to a 2 bedroom apartment across the alley the next day, which reminded me of the exorcist movies. The furniture once again was falling apart at the seams, but it was a welcome change compared to the first room. Overall, I would give it maybe a 1 star in comparison to other hotel standards. The only saving grace was that one of the front desk guys (the late afternoon shift) was very kind to our travel partners when her luggage was lost and she needed assistance in calling the airport. I can't say the other front desk folks were as kind. Also, the waterboat entrance had a lovely view which made Venice seem surreal and all the more enchanting. Be forewarned though, if you arrive after midnight, the hotel recommends that you hire a private water taxi (100 euro for the trip!). You can alternatively take a bus that is right outside of the airport to the public waterbus dock and then board the waterbus for 22 Euros. From there, it is a 10 minute walk to San Marco. Go to the very end of San Marco and go down the last alley, and there you will find All Angelo if you are arriving by foot. Overall though, I would not recommend this hotel. I was terrified of sleeping there and heard scurrying all night. If you HAVE to stay in Venice, be prepared.

Upon our arrival we were informed that the A/C had broken that day and would be fixed later that evening. We understood that sometimes things break and were content to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and tough it out until then; no hotel could have been less deserving of our tolerance. We discovered after a brief conversation with other patrons that the A/C had in fact been broken for THREE DAYS prior to our arrival and that the hotel management had purposely withheld this information from our tour company to ensure that we would no find other accommodations elsewhere. Moreover, as conditions continued to worsten at the hotel (the broken A/C being the tip of the iceberg), te hotel management insisted to upset patrons that no other hotels had openings and flatly refused to help find other accommodations. Keep in mind that temperatures in Venice at this time averaged 40 degrees Celsius, as such a lack of A/C is not merely a small discomfort. The hotel was not even gracious enough to apologize and offer fans to patrons; instead they responded with, and I quote: \"worse things have happened\"...\"Americans are spoiled\"... And \"we cannot be expected to produce fans for everyone\". In short the hotel management's reactions to patron inquiries were rude at best, and combative/offensive at worst. I do not deny that we complained about the conditions, perhaps that qualifies as \"spoiled\" in their estimation, but considering that we were paying good money for our stay I hardly find complaining of a lack of A/C in 40 degree Celsius weather \"spoiled\". If this flat dismissal of our requests were not enough, many rooms had water soaking the floors making the carpet wet and musty smelling, many of the showers lacked curtains spilling water on the tile floor and flooding the bathrooms making footing treacherous, water leaks along the ceiling causing peeling paint and mold growth with overpowering odor only barely sums up the inadequacies of the rooms themselves. In addition the elevator/lift broke with 5 of our tour members in it, forcing them to endure 43+ degree Celsius temperatures in a tiny space for at least 15 minutes. Upon their release from the elevator there was ZERO apology for or even acknowledgement from hotel management of thier ordeal. To top things off there was a late night visit from the Venician fire department for some undisclosed reason. When we asked why the fire department was there we were rudely told that it was \"nothing\". Perhaps things are done differently in Venice, but typically a visit from the Fire Department is not \"nothing\". Overall, our experience was profoundly negative and the conditions/staff hospitality were well below the expectations of even the most tolerant of travelers.

The double room was on the small side, with not too many amenities. Whilst being clean it was in need of updating - bathroom was ok though no bath (just a shower). No foreign TV channels available (CNN, BBC World) just Italian - TV quality poor. Guests get 15% discount in the hotel restaurant & the sister pizza place across the road; this does help in Venice (at least a little). The All Angelo restaurant however is quite expensive - food is ok but overpriced for the quality; service is slow especially when busy. Be warned - the wine list is the SAME as in the pizza place but priced up about 3-5 euro a bottle !! The pizza place also give the 15% & is far better value for money. The main gripe would be the breakfast; not much choice - terrible coffee (out of a very slow dispensing machine) terrible fruit juice (also out of a dispensing machine); little food choice especially for hot food (bacon or scrambled eggs) - bread not fresh. As this hotel appears to accept tours (Globus, Cosmos to name two) breakfast gets verrrrry busy; the room is small & will NOT accept everybody at once so you end up waiting for a table; the furniture is also very old & the chairs uncomfortable. This needs sorting out; if this was somewhere else (Paris say) it would struggle for a 4-star rating - as its Venice, & for the money, I guess its gets away with it to a degree, Location is great - just a minute (literally) away from the Basilica.

I had some accumulated points on a credit card so I booked through Hotelopia. I requested a canal view as it was a birthday treat. This was totally ignored. In fact we were not even in the main hotel. We were given a second floor apartment in a separate building a few paces away from the hotel. It was very large and would have slept six people. The beds were clean and comfortable. There was an apology for a television in the bedroom which only received local Italian TV. The picture was appalling. I would have expected a good picture and some international TV for a centrally located hotel. There was a large lounge with a bed/settee and plenty of wardrobe space. Sadly , there were no tea or coffee making facilities or even a kettle. They obviously wanted us to spend money on their expensive cold refreshments in the well stocked fridge. The bathroom was adequate but the bath and shower were a joke. Fortunately we are both agile but the very slim bath had no grab handles and would in our opinion, have been dangerous for anyone who was large and less agile. The shower never turned off and always sprayed water even when turned to bath. It was hand-held only and one was thus unable to have a proper shower. The toilet continually ran with water, not a problem for us as we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear it but what a waste of resources. The cabinet was well stocked with shampoo, soap and shower caps (hardly necessary) and the towels were plentiful. Overall the bathroom needs a makeover. Breakfast was across the passageway in the main hotel. It was adequate but the same every day. The only warm food was bacon and scrambled eggs. There were cold meats and cakes plus juices and tea and coffee. Amazingly no toast of any description only rolls. The staffs were helpful and informative. Another point of warning. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put on too many lights as the fuse kept tripping out. It happened twice and I called for assistance on the first occasion to locate the fuse box. A few seconds later it happened again. I soon worked out the apartment didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like all its lights left on a once. The electrical wiring also needs a makeover.

Upon arrival on the Alilaguna we wandered through St Mark's Square and, after a few minor hiccups, found the hotel which was only a 3minute walk away, with no bridges to manouvere with our suitcases. The foyer is quite impressive and the reception staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay. Our room was very spacious and the bathroom was well equipped, albeit the decor was slightly dated, we were located on the 5th floor (there is a lift) and had a stunning view over the tops of Venice and the canal to the rear of the hotel, for the price our accomodation was fantastic.

As a guest you receive 15% discount when eating in one of the 3 hotel restaurants which we did on the 1st evening, however this discount was pointless as they charge 3.50 euros per person cover charge and a 12% service chaarge, and for a pizza it turned out to be one of the more expensive meals during our stay, however on the main street near to the hotel there are restaurants that don't charge cover or sevice and the food is of a good standard, especially the one located next door to MacDonalds (which looks slightly drab from the outside). Note, one vening we decided to treat ourselves and ate at one of the restaurnats on the Grand Canal next to the Rialto Bridge as the prices appeared quite reasonable, but the staff were rude, the food was mediocre and it turned out to be pretty expensive, stick to the small streets and the food can be quite reasonable.

The 2 single rooms were small but had all that was needed for a short stay.Room 405 does not have an in room safe as their website indicated but the other two did. I was told I could use the lobby safe.This room also had no hotel information guide /welcome booklet!

Reception were helpful - both single rooms only had one flat pillow so we requested another which appeared quickly. Beds were hard but not the worst I've ever been in. Both single rooms had lovely shower rooms recently renovated. The double room had an mixed look - new heated towel rail but old tiles, some cracked. There were notices around apologising for problems caused by the hotel improvements. We did not see any evidence of mess anywhere or hear any noise.Our rooms were all on different floors so I would have noticed.

It is literally a 2 minute walk from St Mark's Square, and we got a fantastic deal on the room (100 euro a night) from Venere.com. However, it was under renovations when we stayed there, so our room was... less than optimal. The air conditioning hadn't yet been connected, so to compensate for it, they gave us one of those stand-up room air condtioners, but we had to leave the window open because the vent had to go somewhere. Not the most ideal situation, security wise, especially since the room had no safe. The moldings around the door had been removed at some point during renovations, and never replaced. It didn't feel particularly clean, but this could have been due to the renovations going on right outside the door. After seeing the room, we went down and complained. We were shown an apartment across the lane, which was also owned by the hotel, and was HUGE. It could easily have slept 5 people comfortably. It had central air conditioning and a nice big bed in the main bedroom. Definitely an improvement over our original room, and it was incredibly clean and the central air conditioning kept it icy cool during the serious Venice heat. For the same price, I couldn't complain any more. Absolutely perfect. I just wish I had noticed the shutters outside the window on the first night! They definitely helped shut out some of the noise from the restaurant down the alley, as well as keeping out the light in the morning. Breakfast was your typical continental breakfast - rolls, ham, cheese, cold cereal, juice, tea, and coffee. Some sweets if you're so inclined. All in all, I think the All'Angelo will be fantastic once they finish renovating. If you can get into one of the apartments, do so, it's much better than the typical (for Europe) small rooms of the main hotel. The staff at the desk was incredibly helpful, if a bit brusque, and the hotel (well, our apartment anyway) was clean, mostly quiet, and ideally situated. For the price?

It is a beautiful hotel, and very well located- just off Piazza San Marco. Location is important in Venice as you can end up being far away fmro the attractions, or having to take a water taxi back to your hotel if you are on the wrong island, and cheaper ones tend to be far away. But this hotel is right in the centre of it all. We only paid 65 euro for the room for the night, which was a fantastic price, though it may have only been temporarily cheaper because they were renovating at the time (this didn't interfere with our trip at all). Positives: *Fantastic location, easy to walk to everthing that you might want to see, but down a side lane so you're not in a swarm of people on a main strip as soon as you step outside (though we were there in winter, it will be busier in summer!). The furthest place to walk to is the train station (which isn't in a nice area so that is not a bad thing). *Large rooms wiht a big desk and a huge bathroom *Very well cleaned *Bathroom is large with a bath, and also bidet if that's your sort of thing. *Comfortable beds give you a good night of sleep *Excellent service- porters to take up your bag, and the gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and very helpful with booking tours and recommending activities. *There is a restaurant attached in a little grotto that does excellent pizzas, and you get a discount if staying in the hotel. *Heaps of other restaurants, cafes, and shops nearby, and the tourist centre is just on the other side of Piazza San Marco *Good breakfast- there is a variety of breads, pastries, cakes, cereal, cold meats, and juices and coffee. Not so good: *The walls are a bit thin so I could hear the couple next door arguing, but I didn't get woken up from sleep at all so it wasn't too bad!

However, others in our group were very unhappy with their rooms saying that the showerheads fell off, etc. On the negative side, there was very little airconditioning in the rooms and we had to open the door to the hallway ...which was cooler than our room. Many people in the tour had no air and were given fans by the front desk. Also , the breakfast that was served was the poorest we encountered in Italy with canned fruit and a very limited selection. Interestingly, the hotel has no lobby-only a front desk area and when our 30 year old son came to join us for dinner , he wasn't allowed to come up to our room even though I asked the front desk to send him up as his mother wasn't quite ready. I was told by the front desk that \"no one other than registered guests may go up to a room\"....this was certainly the first time I had encountered this policy in over 50 years of traveling.
