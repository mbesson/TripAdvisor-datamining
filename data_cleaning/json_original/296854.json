The rooms may be basic but it was large enough, very clean and comfortable. Since this was an old building, i expected the bathroom to be outdated but it turned out to be newly remodelled and was very large and clean. Breakfast is simple but filling and plentiful. The hotel could however improve the lighting in the stair landing. Also, the elevator which could be used only for luggages, was a bit difficult to operate.

The staff were very helpful and room cleaned daily with clean towels. We took the bus from the aiport and the hotel was quite easy to find from the bus station. The water bus stop was just around the corner from the hotel, this took you to St Marks Square and other stops en route. The main station is about 5 mins walk which is very handy when moving on to next location. We booked a walking tour and gondola ride (separate) in advance of travel. This saved wasting time when we got there, not sure if it saved money. The gondola ride was worth every penny (just under \u00c2\u00a3100 for the 3 of us).

The reason for my trip to Venice was to participate in the marathon. I was looking for a relatively cheap hotel to spend a couple of nights- I did not expect much. To make this review short and sweet I would recommend this hotel for price and location, however, there were a couple of things that made my stay unpleasant. My issues were related to 1) the lack of hot water and 2) the room temperature. 1) My daily shower is a very important to me as it sets me up for the day. The morning of the marathon I woke up at 6.30 am and there was no hot water and therefore I had a cold start to the day. When I returned from the marathon later that day there was no hot water again. I called reception who said that they would fix the issue. I then waited 40 minutes, longer than the 10 minutes that I was told to wait, and tested the water to find that it was still cold. After raising the issue again with reception I ended up showering in a room on another floor. The hotel was not too apologetic. 2)The room was cold no matter how high we had the heating and when I requested another blanket I was told that it wasn't possible as the hotel was full. I spent the night before the marathon a little restless and cold- not the best start after waking up early that morning to catch a flight from London to Venice. To be fair the hotel did supply an extra blanket the second night however again I felt like my request was an inconvenience to the staff member. In conclusion, there were good points about the hotel, price, location, breakfast however I think they should expect to provide hot water as a minimum.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Parsippany, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cThis is the place for location and value, not glamor\u201d", "Author": "mistry11", "ReviewID": "UR118073256", "Content": "We selected this hotel for it's location to the cruise port and it was only a 5 minute walk from Piazzala Roma, which is where the buses from the airport bring you.

We arrived at Marco Polo Airport around 10:30pm and managed to hop aboard the express ATVO Fly Bus to Piazzale Roma, which was directly in front of the Arrivals Terminal. It took approx. 30 mins and cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 each. You can buy your tickets at either the ticket counter located within the airport or from the bus driver. The hotel was a convenient 3 min walk from the Piazzale Roma - no bridges to cross. We walked along the side of the People Mover station which led to the canal on which the hotel is located. As you enter the foyer you truly appreciate the age of the building which has been well maintained with its stone walls and aged marble steps. The receptionist at the counter was cordial and told us that our room was located on the second floor. Unfortunaltely, we had to take the stairs with our heavy luggage as the lift was locked. The building is vast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is deceiving from the outside \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there was quite a bit of searching for those sensor lights as we when through the corridors. Our room was small and basic with no TV but clean which was sufficient for our one night. The bathroom was a very good size with a great shower and loads of towels and toiletries. I have to say the best thing was the view from the bathroom window which faced directly towards the Marittima Cruise Ship Terminal where we could see our ship in the distance. Breakfast was a basic continental and coffee was served by a very pleasant gentleman in the main dining room. With its exposed wooden beans you can truly feel the history here. The hotel is ideally situated close to a water taxi stop and it was just lovely to sit along the canal in front of the hotel and watch the boats go by. At checkout we were able to leave our bags as we decided to a take a few hours to explore Venice before jumping on the People Mover (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 each) for the ship. Please note that while our bags were at the hotel we took a little trek part of the way to the Cruise Ship Terminal and it was quite a walk over various terrain. The People Mover is well worth the price.

We weren't expecting a great deal but, as long as you remember that the hotel is at the budget end you will not be disappointed. This place doesn't have views of St Marks Square, the rooms are not luxurious and they don't have 40 inch screen TVs but do you really go to Venice to stay in your hotel? We booked a quad room. What we got were adjoining rooms (101 and 102) with a large en-suite. The room was spotless, the beds were comfortable, the bathroom was good and the air con efficient. The towels weren't thick and fluffy but the were lots of them. The staff , who spoke English,were accommodating- our room was ready and checking in early was no problem. Other visitors who arrived well before check-in time were allowed to leave their bags, Similarly the hotel was fine about us leaving our bags in reception after we checked out. The building itself is pleasant and they have left some interesting original features in place. Breakfast is plain and simple but plentiful-we enjoyed it If like us, you are staying in Venice prior to joining a cruise this place is in an ideal situation. Get the direct bus from Marco Polo- it costs 5 euros, buy tickets before you leave the airport- the hotel is three minutes easy walk away from the stop (another reviewer gives good directions). The highly efficient people carrier costs 1 euro and takes you to the port. . We spent the day in Venice and found our way round pretty easily, The city isn't that big and there are signs on the walls giving you directions to the major attractions. However I did get lost looking for the Coop near to the hotel. It's great if you want to buy a good cold beer- prices in bars and restaurants can be high. To find it leave the hotel and walk back to the bus station. On the far side of the bus station is the canal. There is a large modern foot bridge over the canal. Make your way to the bridge but don't cross it. Go down the broad flight of steps to the left- there are a number of stops for vaperreto in front of you -take a left and walk alongside the canal for about a hundred metres- the coop is the last building you get to.

I would definitely reccomend this hotel for anyone wanting a cheaper than average stay in Venice, but still after nice surroundings and hotel.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cThis is the place if you want kind, caring service...\u201d", "Author": "civismundi", "ReviewID": "UR27945849", "Content": "If you want excellent service and a clean, well-run hotel, this is your place in Venice.

Breakfast was the standard continental type, perfectly adequate and the receptionists were very friendly and helpful (we didn't meet any other staff). The Bed. The bed was the downfall of the whole holiday, I have never heard such a noisy, squeaky bed - it squeaked if you breathed too hard, and turning over was out of the question! After the second night I suffered terribly with by back all the following day, but I do have a sensitive back. Venice itself was lovely, wandering down the narrow streets and across the different types of bridges. The architecture of the myriad churches and old buildings was really something although, unless you intend to visit all the museums and interiors of buildings open to the public, one day was quite enough for us. We did walk miles and covered well over half of Venice, although I think maybe at this time of year there may be less to see as we only saw two street markets, which are fascinating, and I think there may be a lot more earlier in the year when the weather is better. It is ludicrously expensive for takeaway food and for drinks, we like a quite drink in the evening but it cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.50 for a 330ml can of lager in the cafe bars which were not really set up for people to just sit and have a drink and restaurants were the only other alternative. Our hotel did have a vending machine with 330ml cans of Tuborg for just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20 but that wasn't quite the same. There are seemingly hundreds of gift shops which we thought were, on the whole, very reasonable.

I had a room with a private bed and private bathroom, paid about 55 euros which included a simple breakfast. Booking: I contacted the hotel directly via email, to which Ezio responded promptly, answering any questions I may have had. They accept credit cards, and hold reservations without needing the number. They even changed the reservation for me a few days before I arrived since my plans have to be rearranged. Area: Decent area - seemingly a bit shady. You either take a ferry taxi 1 stop from the train station, or walk through 3 or 4 mini bridges. I'd estimate 10 minute fast walk, 20 minute walk with luggage. Far from the main area - wasn't quite ideal for me in the end. Literally had to walk 25 minutes down one direction before hitting the square. Accommodations: Very cozy. Good bed, clean, comfortable. Lovely bathrooms (after shlepping through Europe, it was MUCH appreciated!) It was a bit odd - my room door opened to stairs, so I'd have to walk down the stairs to get to my bed. Internet available next to the front desk - I believe they charge a few euros per hour. Breakfast was bleh. It was a cold croissant in a plastic wrapper, with some coffee/tea available. Not much else. No elevator available (at least not while I was there). Hallways were almost pitch black when I was there. Had to feel my way around to find my room. Summary: I might be biased because it's Venice, and hey - what the hell, you know? But I enjoyed my stay at Casa Sant'Andrea. As shady as I thought it might be, it was pleasant and comfortable, if not a bit far from the central attractions. I'd still stay there again!", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood value but hotel too noisy\u201d", "Author": "dobedobedo", "ReviewID": "UR14216721", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in March 2008.

We booked our stay at the Casa Sant'Andrea with Bargainholidays.com and after reading some of the previous reviews on here I started to worry that we would be without an ensuite bathroom. I attempted to ease my worry by contacting Bargainholidays who informed me that they only sell rooms that are ensuite from the Casa Sant'Andrea. I was relieved when we arrived to find that this was indeed the case. Once we arrived at Marco Polo airport we managed to find where we could buy tickets for the number 5 bus to take us to Central Venice. At a very reasonable 2euro per person, I recommend this in comparison to the rather expensive taxi boats. The Casa Sant'Andrea is about a two minute walk from where the number 5 bus stops at the Piazalle Roma. It sits just on the outside of the main tourist area - close enough for all the action and quiet enough to get a good nights sleep! The rooms are basic, with no TV etc, but they are clean and tasteful and our bathroom was pleasently spacious. The breakast was exactly as described on other reviews - packet croissants and not much else, what you would expect from accomodation of this price range. All of the staff we met were pleasent and helpful and were always willing to speak english.
