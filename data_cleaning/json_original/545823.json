{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dingy and disappointing After reading mixed reviews about this hotel, we decided to book a week's stay anyway. Despite a nice location and beautiful grounds, the hotel itself is old and tired. It certainly doesn't justify the relatively high rates being charged and the suggestion on the hotel's website that it is five star! The superior room we were shown was dark, dingy and smelly. We had requested a double room but were given a twin. Eventually after complaining, we were offered a double room but like the other room and the rest of the hotel, it was tired and in need of re-decoration. If you like small, dark rooms, in large, ageing corporate hotels and baking on sunbeds with hoards of people, then this is the hotel for you. It certainly wasn't the hotel for us and we left having paid for one night, to spend the rest of the week at another hotel.", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR271909421", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Appycouple"}, {"Content": "LOVED IT - Margaret [Scotland] HelloWe stayed at Sanur Beach Hotel 9th October - 21st October and had the most fab time - The Hotel was great, the staff, the food, the pool. eveyrhting was just perfect,The weather well shouldn't complain it was to Hot - The Beach has the best breeze.The sea food resturant was really good - we were all inclusive and the only thing we would have had to pay for was Lobster.Madie who works at Beach Bar was great - he took us round island and was great tour guy - nothing ws to much bother night or day.

I can see from other reviews that the hotel could be accused of looking dated but we loved it. We had a sea view room which was very comfortable and clean. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and immaculately clean. The pools were again well maintained (the main pool is huge). The beach was great as there was always a breeze - in fact the breeze was sometimes so strong, it made reading a book difficult! The breakfasts were fantastic and I agree with the review from a previous holidaymaker who said that the omelette lady was a wonder and should be given a medal! We ate in the Italian restaurant which was pretty good and we were serenaded by the singing trio who were good fun! I would definitely recommend the Mezzanine restaurant at the Puri Santrian next door. The food was very good, menu varied and it was not overly expensive. People we spoke to had eaten at Donalds and again said it was good. We drove just over an hour to the Elephant Safari Park which was very expensive but worth it - my girls loved it.

We opted to stay at Sanur for a change. The weather was perfect. The food and drink are such good value (much much cheaper than Thailand - we went to Phuket last September). Meals are so much better! Sanur Beach was okay, but it is about 25 minutes to shops in Kuta and Legian and if you want to mooch around there isn't much in Sanur. The main street is not good for walking at all and not many shops. There are a few restaurants but my recommendation would be in South Kuta or Legian as it is walking distance to shops. The Sanur Beach hotel is definitely not a 5 star hotel as it advertises. It needs a lot of work. We had a room that smelled really damp and felt it and we moved after 4 days to another room which was much better but had an ant infestation problem.

(Cemara Beach Restaurant along the beach is very good.) Cocktails are good, the hotel's beach bar tends not to advertise their happy hour too well so make sure you ask. Our total bill at the end for food and drinks was less than we expected.It's right on the beach but the water at Sanur is not very inviting.
