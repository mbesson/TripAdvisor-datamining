The Inn at The Black Olive was perfect. I didn't feel like I was stuck in another hotel but rather staying somewhere fun and relaxing. The location was amazing and the beds are really comfortable. The restaurant upstairs was excellent. Everyone was really nice and helpful. i only had a few thoughts that weren't totally positive, but they in no way will keep me from staying there every time we're in Baltimore for work. The TV in the living room was on the smaller side. As I don't watch TV a lot that doesn't really matter to me. There was no dock or stereo hookup for an ipod. Would have been nice, but again, I wasn't there to just sit in the room for hours. They only carried glass bottles for water. I get why for sure but it would have been nice to have something more easy to carry outside the hotel. Maybe have water bottles in the room that they can charge for?", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cHeaven!\u201d", "Author": "Beyond_all_Borders", "ReviewID": "UR127946559", "Content": "Thanks to Hotel.com our reservation at a different hotel was misplaced, and so they put us up in a Corner Spa Suite at the Black Olive while attending the Natural Products Expo.

My friend who has expressed to me how clean the Inn is and me being a traveler, part-time travel agent and a person with high standards who has stayed in some of the finest hotels found that hard to believe every hotel has somes dust in the corners. \u00a0Now my first visit here in March I thoroughly inspected the place, however \u00a0I didn't do my how clean is this room test so when I went back this month I decided to challenge him on his review of the Inn. I took with me a pair of brand new white socks and I wore them in the room for 10 hours before I took them off well to my surprise my brand new white socks were still white when I took them off I couldn't believe it. I then went around the room and did the dust bunny test I went through this room with a fine tooth comb and could not find any dust anywhere...very impressive since I have stayed in many hotels, resorts, private rental homes and my biggest complaint is that the room is never cleaned properly this is a big deal for me especially if I'm spending my money to stay there.\u00a0 Well this lovely Organic Greek setting Inn is like apartment living as soon as you enter the rooms the lights come on immediately so there's no looking around for a light switch. The bed/mattress, towels and robes are organic; soft to the skin and the furniture is made of bamboo and recovered wood the walls are my favorite simply because they are not dry wall Dimitris kept the natural look yea I did my homework...I had some free time. Did I also mention that the floors are radiant heated so if you forget your slippers they got you covered. Complimentary organic breakfast, wine, water, and coffee are all available to you in room. Awesome!! Look I could go on all day talking about this place, but why should I if you don't believe me go check it out for yourself I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed.

Traveling to downtown Baltimore for the Oriole\u2019s Opening Day, we thought we would treat ourselves to a night at this lovely, boutique-style inn. Our experience was absolutely wonderful from start to finish! From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. The manager, Alicia, personally escorted us to our suite to make sure we were pleased with our room and to explain the abundant amenities that the room had to offer. The Black Olive Inn\u2019s eco-friendly d\u00e9cor includes not only organic toiletries and bed linens, but also a complimentary bottle of organic wine. As guests, we were given numerous healthy choices for our breakfast the following morning which was delivered to our room promptly at the time we had requested in advance. We were impressed with the spaciousness and cleanliness of the suite, with a large living and dining area, bedroom, and bathroom with a two-person Jacuzzi and large enclosed shower. The bed was so inviting, with soft, organic sheets and bed linens which enveloped you in sheer comfort and allowed you to easily drift off to sleep. For guests traveling on business, their large, flat-screen television also serves as a computer with internet access. The only suggestion for improvement which I shared with the inn\u2019s friendly and courteous director of customer relations, Ryan, would be to place a small sitting stool under the vanity in the bathroom so that guests may comfortably use the nice make-up mirror they provide. This is the perfect place for health-conscious, eco-friendly enthusiasts to spend an evening, weekend, or as much time as their visit to Baltimore allows them. It is great for a romantic getaway and also for the business traveler. The inn is very customer-service oriented and makes sure every need of every guest is met.

The staff explained many of the design and construction decisions in detail. It was terribly interesting and perhaps most importantly, the results of these decisions didn't have a negative effect on the comfort of the accommodations as one unfamiliar with the process might be inclined to think, in fact if anything it improved the comfort level through high quality bedding and furnishings, and improved indoor air quality among other things. Also, the location can't be beat -- close enough to the heart of Fell's Point to ensure you have access to night life, restaurants, and a pleasant environment for walking around, but not so close that the night life is happening right outside your window. The only recommendation I could make to improve the settings would be to add some soft textured wall covering to some of the interior room walls as the high ceilings and large spaces tended to make for a somewhat reverberant environment.

It is a small new boutique hotel with fewer than 15 guest suites. Arriving at the inn the first night was as if I had been transported magically to the Mediterranean coast and was staying in a lovely private villa. The textures, colors and decor (including the vibrant soft handmade carpets) of the inn are natural and restful and soothe away all stress. The bed, linens, towels and other accoutrements are of the highest quality and wrap the guests in a bubble of luxury, comfort and peace. The bathroom is on a par with a spa with an enromous whirlpool bathtub and even larger shower. The flat screen tv did everything but jump off the wall and dance around the room. And of course the complimentary bottle of wine from the region after which your suite is named was most welcome. And then there was the complimentary breakfast which was specially prepared with perfect eggs, with homemade fresh warm toast, homemade marmalade, goart cheese, strawberries and blueberries. To find such a feast with such attentive personal service at a hotel is remarkable in itself. That it was included in the room charge is amazing. This is a hidden gem and very close to Johns Hopkins Hospital if you are visiting there.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExactly what you would want from a hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jehramie", "ReviewID": "UR117753065", "Content": "We stayed here along with another couple on a mini vacation. Our room was the vip corner suite which was beautiful, the room our friends had was a slightly smaller suite, but still had all the same amenities. The wine was very good, and the selection was both large and interesting. Prices were surprisingly low for what i felt was great quality. The free bottle in your rooms was a nice touch. The location of the hotel is great, as it is right next to the fells point area for shopping and nightlife, but not smack in the middle of it. The best part of the stay was the staff. I have traveled a lot and normally stay in higher end hotels and suites, this was by far the most attentive and genuinely concerned staff I've ever dealt with. where i stay is very important part of my trips, and i hate starting with boring disinterested check in personnel. every employee we talked to was very helpful and a pleasure to deal with. I will stay here every time i am in the harbor area from now on. I think the only thing i wasn't completely happy with was the balconies. there were 2 in our room, one from the bedroom and one from the sitting area. I had pictured something a little larger. These were more of small lookout areas. To be clear, I wasn't promised anything about the balconies, just pictured something different,. Still, it wasn't so bad having 2 balconies to look out over the harbor from. :) We did not have the opportunity to try the restaurant in the Hotel unfortunately. but we plan to on our next trip. The Inn at the black olive is exactly what you would want from a hotel, and if you travel to the Baltimore inner harbor or fells point area, I promise you will be disappointed if you stay anywhere else.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria VA", "Title": "\u201cHurricane Irene in the lap of luxury !\u201d", "Author": "lrmdell", "ReviewID": "UR117557397", "Content": "We are three women with an adventureous spirit who braved Hurricanine Irene to stay at the Inn at the Black Olive. We were in the VIP suite( where Woody Harrellson stays),plenty of room, great views of the City and Storm! The Chef prepared dinner for just the guests in the Inn and it was fabulous. Dimitri can really make and Organic drink, and Ryan is a sweetheart. Breakfast was delicious - I think we tried all the choices! I especially liked the greek yougurt and the hand squeezed orange juice. They took very good care of us and we learned much about the green building and organic foods. Sure the service was slow - but it's dinner . . . why rush ! Dimitri went out on the deck of the 5th floor to gather fresh herbs for our drinks and dinner. The baby yellow and red tomatos in the Bloody Mary were to die for - we asked for more and got them! Sparkling Clean, Dining Room Table, Full size stainless steel frig, washer dryer combo (with Eco-detergent) automatic lights, Google TV, WI-FI, and fab towels, robes and slippers. Huge shower and jacuzzi tub - what more could you ask for - oh - the best most comfortable bed! The staff called cabs for us, and even came out to help with the packages.
