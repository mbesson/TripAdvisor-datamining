This hotel was recommened and I went along as I could not miss the dates (Business visit). The hotel is in Topkapi and that was a plus point (Boy what a disappointment). The room rates are extravagant, to put it mildly. Internet is a disappointment and the service is abysmal! There checking time is 12:00 and they made me wait till 2:00 for a room. The rooms are large enough but poorly lighted. Except for 1 or 2 places which is accessible by rail metro going anywhere you need to hire a cab! Breakfast if you are cereals person then it is good for you or you are in for a disappointment! They have lot of variety of Cheese and butter but not much other choices. I survived on bread and butter or cheese!!!!! The hotel staff in general are not very helpful and hardly anyone speaks English!!! The only passable view is from the room that is facing the road! Rest all rooms have either buildings covering! In there website they talk about gym but when you go and enquire you'll be surprised. Firslty the person managing will try to sell you the message packages. When you stress that you are looking for the gym you'll find out that the gym is converted into a massage room and the masseur is a woman (I later learn this is the highlight of the hotel)!

The only consolation is I didn't pay for this bout of suffering, and I strongly advise people to stay there only if they get an offer they cannot refuse. The breakfast is adequate, and the location is pretty bad, although there is a metro station 1 minute away which the receptionist was unaware of!, which stops at a tramway interchange (the interchange is a 5 minute walk from the stop).
