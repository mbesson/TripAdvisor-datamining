The pluses: I thought the bed was comfortable, the room was relatively spacious and modern, and they do provide instant coffee/tea at no additional charge. The room also has a microwave. The minuses are a bit more numerous. There is a mini bar but the prices are high. No mugs for coffee, only styrofoam cups which have a tendency to rupture when you microwave water to make coffee. The room we stayed in had no bath tub, nor did the bathroom have washcloths, only towels and a bathmat. The soap in the shower is a combo shampoo and body soap. The design of the shower is a little peculiar: there is a glass partition that runs about half the length of the shower but the other half is open, hence the floor in the bathroom does get wet when you use the shower. The air conditioning system never really got the room cold enough for my liking. The last thing I want to talk about was their housekeeping and front desk service. After our first night, housekeeping cleaned the room but didn't refill the coffee/tea. We called the front desk and housekeeping did rectify the situation. The 2nd day of our stay, we were out and about in Barcelona the whole day. When we returned, we sadly discovered that housekeeping did not clean the room. When we complained to the front desk, no apologies. They did ask if we left the 'do not disturb' light on. We advised that we did not and the front desk basically said there was nothing they could do since it was late in the evening. We requested new towels and they brought us 2 after about 1/2 hour. Based on the price paid, the hotel didn't live up to the reviews that I read and I really expected more.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood but could be better\u201d", "Author": "GV5_UK", "ReviewID": "UR128038131", "Content": "I booked a triple room for myself, wife and 6 year old son for a long weekend. The location was exactly what I was expecting, walking distance to a decent beach but out of town away from the noise. There is a tram stop right outside which will take you into town for 2 Euro's and is only 10 mins. It's a 20 minute taxi ride to the airport, around 35-40 Euros. We were on the 2nd floor above reception and on Saturday night could hear the music from the bar downstairs which was dissapointing. Also we must have had the main waste water pipe next to our room as we constantly had water noise gushing through a pipe near our room entrance. I think we were probably unlucky with our room and it's not common but it tainted my experience. I also found the bed too hard and woke in the morning with back ache, not that I slept much anyway due to the music and gushing sounds! The hotel also let themselves down by visible cost saving excersies such as soap dispensers in the bathroom instead of toiletries and the strict dont touch anything in the minibar or on the shelves or you will be charged policy, which makes it feel a little tacky. The hotel was very clean and the staff were excellent, the pool area is nice but dissapointed it was not heated - I was unable to take my son in as it was too cold although it was a nice sunny April day. The breakfast at 15 Euros I felt was quite good value for money - excellent choice and plenty there, although it could get quite busy. Bathroom was nice too, but a shame we had no bath only a shower - it was a good shower though! This is a very functional hotel and if you get a good room I can see you can give it higher rating.

Felt that they did not much care about the client, or about their business. Considering their rather high rates, they missed out on 300 euros of billing. - Gym: good assortment of machines, free weights + a window on the outside, which is a big plus when compared to most underground gyms at European hotels. But, no towels before 10.00AM, when most business people would agree that the time to use the gym is usually between 6 and 8.00AM. - Spa: sauna, jacuzzi. No access available, despite having booked an all-inclusive fare. Not sure what I really paid for. - Lounge at Level 15: not sure the coffee machine is the best around. Gave up trying to make it work after 10'. Drinks are available, but no food around either in morning or late afternoon. - Restaurant: I completely missed the restaurant. It did look closed every time I looked that way, so I ended up eating in other places in town or around the hotel. More euros missed by the hotel team. - Room: OK. Bed is just OK.

Pool is great but the area is completely taken over by a lot of people sunbaking. I used the spa service, it was lovely. My partner & I stayed here for 7 nights & couldn't fault any of the hotel services. Cons: The only negatives we found were actually in relation to the other guest staying in the hotel. Not the hotel at all. We found that most of the hotel guests were a bit older. I wouldn't recommend staying with kids.. as 99% of the people we encountered were very 'posh' & I saw a few well behaved kids getting told to stop swimming around so roughly in the pool.. I personally look forward to meeting & socializing with other people from around the world, we failed to meet anyone who could manage a smile in the public areas of the hotel. This didn't impact our stay hugely, I think it's just worth making note of. Basically, Don't bring the family & if being surrounded by snobby people bothers you, look else where.

My room was a double and faced the incompleted construction of the future wing of the hotel (no construction is going on - not noisy).

Everything is very modern, a bit trendy, yet comfortable. Would have preferred a desk and lamp rather than a pair of chairs and round bistro table. Bathroom is very clean and modern with water closet, bidet, Duravit vessel sink and Duravit bathtub/shower. The shower is very slippery so be careful. The water in the hotel (or in Barcelona?) is very alkaline. It took a long time to feel clean from soap residue. Bed was very comfortable and I slept well. One odd thing is there is no clock in the room. Phones do not have any features that allow one to receive messages or to call someone else's room directly. There is a touch screen that controls all the lighting, air conditioner, etc. Be sure to get an orientation on how to use this, as the entry light can only be controlled by the panel. The lighting could be improved, but they were going for design over function. Mechanical system was pretty quiet and non-intrusive. The breakfast was included as part of the room rate. Since there are few choices in the area for a quick bite, I was happy to have access to food - hams, cold cuts, cheeses, fresh fruit, juice, torta, eggs, bacon, etc. Coffee choices are available through a machine - so so, but again, happy to have some caffeine.

When we checked in for our 5 night stay, we were given a regular double room on the 5th floor. I called and said I had booked a triple, and the answer I got, was that they could provide an extra bed. I thought I had booked a larger room, not a stuffed double! The room had no remote control for the tv, no ice bucket - and the ice machine on the floor was broken for the whole stay, the bed was hard and uncomfortable with hard pillows and only sheets to cover yourself with, the high tech system to regulate lights and temperature made us both freeze and sweat through the night, and the worst part was the housekeeping. Every day except the last day, I had to call to get towels. One day they removed the old ones without replacing them, another they gave us 1 new, the third they just hanged up the dirty ones we had left on the floor and so it went on. I normally don't mind using my towel twice, but with a baby and the heat outside, we needed fresh towels every day, which I told the front desk several times. All they could say, was \"we're sorry\", and then the same thing happened the next day. The tiny pool on the 17th floor was crowded, with only a few sunbeds, so we headed for the beach instead. The hotel charges 3 euros for use of towels at the pool. As a frequent traveler, I thought this only happened at 3 star hotels. It's forbidden to use the room towels outside the pool (if you are lucky to get any), they charge you for pool towels (if you are lucky to get a sunbed or chair), the minibar stated that you will be charged directly if you move any items (which I hardly believe, as there is no sensor there) and the staff in the well-equipped gym chase you out 15 minutes before closing time. We were glad to leave, and having stayed at several other hotels in Barcelona earlier, we would not recommend this hotel. The nearby Hilton Diagonal Mar for instance, is in another league!

The warm welcome made us feel at home immediately. We chose this hotel for its proximity to the Cirque du Soleil \u2013 the purpose of the trip. Not many hotels in this area cater for families as well as the Diagonal Zero. In fact, it is the only one we found with a family room. The rooms are two standard hotel rooms leading on to a play area with a lockable external door. The only niggle we found was having identical key cards for the rooms. If the key cards could open both rooms, then this would be a lot easier. Or failing that, mark the cards with the room numbers. As we had young children (6 and 7 year olds) we didn\u2019t feel that we could leave them alone in the 2nd room by themselves. So, our solution was to have one adult and one child in each room. The separate room would be fine for children of 11 to 12 years old. Another solution would be to take the Jacuzzi suite which is more expensive, but the children are then properly supervised. We didn\u2019t like the idea of leaving our children alone in their own room, although they are well-behaved. (Madeleine McCann syndrome on our part). We asked a member of staff to recommend a good Spanish restaurant, which was given with enthusiasm. The receptionist organized a taxi for us to La Fonda del Port Olimpic \u2013 a wonderful culinary experience. The dishes we chose were suckling pig, turbot and paella all washed down with a Crianza Rioja \u2013 a memorable meal. The children were made very welcome and could practice their Spanish language. The highlight of the trip was the performance at the Cirque du Soleil. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the beach. The 3-day rain was no problem as there is a large shopping centre with cinemas and restaurants opposite the hotel. The Zero has a spacious, private, clean and well-lit underground car park. The 3 x 13 person lifts/ elevators have a security feature which can only be used with the room key card. Large flat screen TVs, comfortable bathrooms, minibar, snacks, microwave, state-of the-art computer-controlled temperature and ambiance lighting system and smoke detectors all made our stay a wonderful experience.

Starting at the arrival that they had reserved a twin-beded room instead of a double room with one kind-sized bed, the peak was reached when the cleaning woman threw away the pastries we bought for next day's breakfast and our voucher for the flight back home!!! When we went to the reception to ask them to manage this problem the receptionist Javier phoned housekeeping and told us to wait for ten minutes. After half an hour of waiting we decided to phone the tour operator, therefore we asked the second receptionist to dial the number for us. She explained to us that we should call from our room, where we would have had to pay for it, but when we told her what was going on she left the phone to us. Fortunately our tour operator sent the voucher by email to us, so we were able to get back home. Later this day we met Javier in the elevator. He didn't apologize, he didn't even say \"hello\", he just looked the other way! The next morning we went to the reception again to talk to the manager and complain about he whole problem. After all the manager said that he was sorry and that he would talk to Javier to tell him that he should apologize personally... We can only say that that all took at least five hours of our holiday, not to mention all the excitement and that the frase \"Maybe he will apologize personally\" didn't satisfy us at all!!! Furthermore the air conditioning is very bad, as soon as you leave the room it automatically begins to cool down at approximately 15 degrees centigrade. Even though we switched off the air conditioning when we entered the room we were freezing in the night and when we departed both of us had a cold. Once we met other guests in the elevator who told us that they had to move to another room because their shower \"was like a swimming pool\". Apropos: the swimming pool which is located on the roof is very very small, that may probably be the reason why it's so terribly contaminated.

Bedrooms look good but in practise are crazy. Intelligent lighting has a mind of its own - we had to take bulbs out to sleep as some just would not turn off.

Impossible to visit bathroom in night without waking up partner as the blind between bathroom and bedroom is not a blackout. No hot water on first night. Also power cut which isnt hotels fault - however when power came back on every light in the room came on with it !

Huge glass windows by lifts dirty and since I arrive have not been cleaned. Same in bedroom. Breakfast probably the worst I have ever endured. 'Hot' food is put out when it opens and just sits there getting colder - I asked for an omlette which every other hotel I have stayed in is happy to provide - but not here. First morning I arrived half an hour before it closed and there was no fruit left - and none more put out - eggs cold and congealed - staff took my plate away to warm it up but never came back until I asked for it 20 mins later by which time I needed to leave. In a city that is full of hotels there is no need to put up with this standard - if it was cheap then you could say you get what you pay for - but it isnt so stay somewhere that tries harder. Rooftop pool pointless and COLD!! Havent they heard of solar heating ??? Near congress centre so built as a business hotel - hence the prices - absolutely no point in staying here if you are a tourist as there is nothing to do at this end of the city and nowhere decent to eat nearby.

The hotel itself is lovely, very modern and clean, lots of space and storage area in the room, it's on a main road which isnt too bad at night; there's a tram stop just outside which takes you up the Avenue Diagonal. The breakfast is lovely, lots of choice, hot and cold buffet, you have to use the machine to make your own coffee which is a bit of a pain but it tastes nice. The rooftop pool is a nice touch, somewhere you can grab a lounger and have a chillout and a read if you like, but FYI, just across the road is the Parc de Forum which is a huge lido where you can swim or just chill out, very popular with the locals. WHen you're walking toward it it looks like you're heading to an old quarry or something, but dont be fooled, its fab. The hotel is in an area that is being redeveloped and there is a pretty decent mall just across the road too, with all the big chain shops you can think of, the Mango store is excellent! There's a huge store like a Tesco or WallMart in there where you can stock up on cheap nibbles and wine if you fancy having a quiet night in. Room Service is good, dont keep you waiting too long, English is very well spoken throughout hotel and staff are friendly. The bar just by the reception is lovely, it's got a nice outside area too where you can sit and enjoy a beveridge. Prices are the usual hotel costs. The nearest metro is El Maresme Forum, basically you exit the station walk straight on, take a right and walk to the end of this street where you will find a restaurant/cafe, and you'll see the hotel on your left on the other side of the road about 3/4 mins from the station. Handy. It's 9 stops from the Passeig de Grassia where you need to change at if you're getting the train from the airpor, dont be fooled though as you have to walk a good 5/8mins to the yellow line as the passeig de grassia is huge!!! Make sure you buy the T10 metro ticket cos it's v cheap and if there are two of you travelling you can both use it, you dont need to buy two! The Bus Touristica is well worth it, we got the two day pass to make sure we got the most out of it, but one day will do you if you're happy to use the metro. The bus was pretty quiet on the Sunday meaning we had no probs jumping on and off, but on the Monday it was carnage, avoid getting on at the Plaza de Cataluna as the queues are huge (it's at the top of Las Ramblas). We didnt have any pick-pocket problems, in fact didnt see anything bad at all, we didnt bother walking down Las Ramblas though, just looked down it, that was enogh for us to be honest. The gothic quarter is def worth a wander around, Sagrada Familia = immense and a must see, Park Guell is beautiful and another def must see. Nou Camp tour really good, they let you into all the good bits, dont go on a Sunday afternoon though as its closed.

I wish I could be more positive, I normally am, but a few things (especially the maids) made this a bad experience. Negative: -When we first entered the hotel it smelt like sewage in the lobby. -The deskman could not find our booking at first, which was a bit stressful. -We were given a room at a smoking-floor, even though we booked non-smoking, this may explain the bad smell in the hall and at the room. -The room smelt weird when we entered it (the bathroom smelt like pee), the air improved a bit after we had put on the air condition for a while. -The thing that ruined the experience the most were the maids! I have never in my life experienced more annoying maids. They knocked on our door in the morning and came in to our room while we were asleep and wanted us to leave the room in 20 minutes. This happened every morning. And most of the days they had not even done our room in the afternoon when we returned from the beach (to take a shower before we went out again). We stayed only 5 days, and some of our plans were ruined because of this. For example, we planned to go to a museum and watch a flamenco show one day, and the room was not ready when I got there four o'clock in the afternoon. The maid told me to wait 20 minutes, and I went down in the lobby and waited 30 minutes. When I returned the room was still not ready, and I had to wait for an hour in the hall, sitting on the floor because they never finished. We didn't reach the flamenco show, and the next day there was no show, and the day after our plane left, so we missed the flamenco :( Every morning we were stressed because we knew they were going to knock and enter our room and nag, and every afternoon we were stressed because we wondered if the room was finished so that we would reach our plans.... -The water pressure in the shower was a joke, you had to stick to the wall to hit the water. However, you would then hit a button on the floor that closed the drain, so that you had to stand in this strange position. -What's up with a big window into the bathroom? Most people enjoy privacy at the toilet.. -We asked in the desk if we could get a knife and spoon to our room. He said it was no problem. Five minutes later they called our room and told us we had to call another number and order it through room service. So we did, but they said we had to order food or something from the menu to get a knife and spoon....most cumbersome way I have ever tried to obtain a knife and spoon.. -We wente to the roof to check out the sunbeds..there were no available, and when we laid down on the floor it smelt pee. -When we booked the room we though it was close to the beach. Unfortunately it was not possible to cross the motorway, and we had to walk for 15 minutes to find a way down to the beach. -Even though the area was quiet, the trip to the city centre was a little bit far Positive: -The bar staff were very nice and helpful. -The staff in the restaurant (Echo) were extremely nice and friendly, and the food was delicious! We had a meal at that restaurant just before we left, which actually improved the whole impression. I wish we used the restaurant more often when we were there. -The internet connection was good. -The technical facilities were good. -The rooms were nice and spacious, big closet and big pillows. -The shopping centre across the street was convenient.

There is a shade, but it's not opaque -- I noticed with a light on in the bathroom, I could read through the shade. So it was not good for our mixed-gender family group. There's a generous wardrobe, but only three very shallow drawers to put stuff in.

Insufficient places to hang wet towels. Not good tolietry items, and the bottles don't seal; some of the items looked to have been used before by others. Not much free counter space in the bathroom.

Apparently even though none of the contents of the standard breakfast apart from the choice of tea/coffee/juice have a tick box next to them (they have bullet points) you still have to tick them. 4) The night before checking out I requested a taxi for 4.30 am and a wake up call for 4.00 am.
