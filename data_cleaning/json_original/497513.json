When we finally got to our Hotel Hotel Centrale we were told that the Italian Agency IMG Incoming had over booked and we had to transfer to Hotel Garda. Another taxi drive away we arrive at our new hotel Hotel Garda. There is only a very small plaque on the wall you could very easily miss the place! You have to ring a buzzer to enter and push a big heavy wooden door. You walk down a long corridor marbled floor to another door and buzzer. Then a lift that fits 2 people or 1 person and a big suitcase upto the 4th floor for reception. The lady on reception checked us in but wasnt interested in helping us out trying to sort our transfer back to the airport out. Our room was very small dark and dingy. It reminded me of a room we had in New York some years ago. There was a small window but no real light came in. There was a mini bar/fridge but you had to move a chair to get in it and it wasnt capable of keeping a bottle of water cold........... The bed was ok but the 1 pillow each wasnt enough they were as flat as pancakes! There was a wardrobe which was that tall you had to use a pole to take your clothes in and out. The bathroom was ok but the toilet was so close to the wall if you were wide or tall your legs would be up the wall! We had plenty of towels and there was shampoo/gel but this wasnt topped up at all in the 4 days we were there. The shower was naff it went hot and cold and the shower head was old and worn so water sprayed all over the place. The room temperature was too hot and stuffy and we only managed to get a remote control for it on our last night which meant a couple of nights being woken up too hot. The room was not noisy and we didnt hear any outside noise. The reception area was clean. All but one member of staff a more senior gentleman were useless they didnt want to help you out. Breakfast! In a small neat and tidy room you were served fresh coffee tea and hot chocolate. Food a cake like a maderia a tart like a treacle/jam tart and 2 types of danish plain and custard which were all nice and fresh. There were also some hard white rolls and some packs of jam and soft cheese. One type of cereal ie cornflakes. Milk and 2 orange juices. No ham or meats. The room had a wiff regardless of whether we left the window open all day or not! The area seemd ok close to the attractions we walked everywhere and a few minutes walk from the Hard Rock Cafe. There is a shop next door and a cafe with outside seating too. One niggle is the WI FI we couldnt always get on it and you have to pay for it! We used the Hard Rock Cafes which was free but you have to show your passport and leave your email address. Not many cafes seem to have it or be willing to let you use it? The only other free place was a The Vatican. It was ok even for a few nights as we were out most of the day and night.

First, there is a front door, which is usually closed, so one has to ring the bell to get the receptionist to open the door. After that, there is a long hallway with another door at the end, and the same procedure is needed to open it. Then one has to take a rather slow elevator to the 5th floor where hotel\u2019s reception is. Finally, with the room key received from the reception, one may need to climb the stairs one floor up (hotel rooms are situated on 5th and 6th floors of the building). All in all the procedure of getting in or out of the hotel takes several minutes and, when repeated several times a day, becomes tiresome. My single room was of a decent size but had some problems that made the stay less enjoyable than it could have been otherwise. The bed was inconvenient \u2013 too small and too soft. The blanket was an old woollen one, also inconvenient, as it was difficult to keep it over the sheet that served as a blanket cover. Bathroom was small and had an inconvenient layout. Worse, there was a problem with water \u2013 it was neither hot enough nor cold enough, always something in the middle. The pressure was extremely poor and it took time for the water to warm up. The shower cabin was old and inconvenient. The room had a mini-bar and an old, small TV (with two English language channels \u2013 BBC and CNN). The window overlooked a narrow courtyard. My room had yet another problem \u2013 every evening there was a distinct mechanical noise coming from within the building (as if some machinery was operated somewhere). This noise would disappear around midnight, but was quite annoying before that. Also, all noises in the corridor or neighbouring rooms were clearly heard in the room. Hotel\u2019s public areas seem to have been recently renovated and look nice, especially the reception and the breakfast room. My rate (60 euro/night) included breakfast, which I never had, (couldn't find anything edible there). The breakfast offer consists of coffee, croissants and low-quality flakes. Hotel staff was generally friendly, except for the lady that seems to be in charge of other staff, who was somewhat pushy. They are not all knowledgeable about Rome however \u2013 I once asked for directions to one very well known attraction near Rome and the advice I got was of little value. Other receptionists were more knowledgeable, though. One tip: one can get a lower price by booking directly from the hotel web site just before the stay (some kind of last minute discount). In conclusion, at 60 euro/night hotel Garda is good value for money, but only due to very good location. Otherwise, lots of minor inconveniencies spoiled my stay, so I will probably not consider Garda again.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcs", "Title": "\u201cHotel Garda and general Rome info\u201d", "Author": "SueWorcs", "ReviewID": "UR10520130", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Garda and booked with Easy to book and sure enough they were! The hotel location is excellent as it is just off the Via Veneto, a curving road with nice shops and restaurants. It is also 5 mins walk from the lovely Parc Borghese, so for those who seek a respite from the city - here is perfect. You can hire bikes and rickshaws and the Galleria Borghese, located in the park, is considered one of the most important museums in the world. It is stuffed full of works by Bellini, Canova and a Reubens that you can get right up close to.However you must book in advance and arrive 30 minutes early otherwise you don't get in. Also near are the famous Spanish steps. At the bottom are fantastic shops - Dior, Gucci, Armani etc. Check them out just to see how the other half live! With regards to the hotel - it is quiet and safe as it is 4 floors up. There is no problem coming back late as reception are on duty 24 hours a day. The reception were particularly helpful, providing maps and information and advice. Breakfast was adequate for us juice, coffee, rolls, croissants. The room was fine, but as some visitors had previously mentioned the shower does not come with curtain, howver provided you were careful it was possible to have a shower without soaking the whole room. Rome is fantastic. I was surprised how much is within walking distance. Definitely recommend the Travestere area, just wander round the streets to get a glimpse of the working life of Rome. The catacombs on the outskirts are good also, again would recommend the walk along the Appia Antica - the old road into Rome, very atmospheric and again a chance to escape the buzz of the city. We used the Terravision bus when we arrived. If you have children buy the tickets at the terminal in Rome and not on the plane they are cheaper. On return to the airport we just asked about buses at the booth outside the train station advertising bus tickets. They sold us even cheaper tickets than Terravsion and our child went free. 12 Euros in total for 3 of us. We felt very safe in Rome, although of course we were careful when travelling amongst the crowds. The buses and metro are great, cheap and easy to use. If you go to the Colosseum with a child take thier passport so you can take advantage of reduced price. We paid for a guide, they are situated outside the Colesseum and they say you don't have to queue. This isn't strictly true as everyone has to go through a scanner for security purposes and this can take some time. Our guide was quite informative but we only stopped in 2 places and she read it all out of a book! For anyone interested in plants take a visit to the botanical gardens - very pretty lots of interesting trees, palms, cacti etc. It's about 1 1/2 miles from the Vatican. All in all a great trip, we love Italy and once again we came back wanting more!

There were various dirty smears on the walls and the carpet was filthy. We had to ask how to use our TV and make a special request to get the air conditioner controller. We called the front desk 3 times one evening, but could not get anyone to answer. The bathroom consisted of a moldy tub with no curtain and a filthy floor.

The maid service was a complete joke and consisted of nothing more than re-making the beds with the same linen (since we found a piece of our own laundry made INTO the bed) and leaving some new towels behind. The maid also moved our luggage around, when there was no need to, since they did NOT vacuum. The \"free breakfast\" was nothing more than cold cereal and a surly woman serving bad coffee.

We decided to stay at the Hotel Garda despite reading bad reviews about it as the location sounded perfect to us, and we wouldn't be in the hotel much anyway. With reading the bad reviews I was expecting the worst but when I arrived realised it was not what some people seemed to think it was. We got a taxi from the airport which cost no more than 25 euros, the taxi driver knew exactly where the hotel was so we had no problems finding the place. When he dropped us off we were a little confussed to start off with as it's on a backstreet and there was no obvious sign to say that it's there but our taxi driver quickly realised and told us which door to go in. The Hotel Garda is on the 3rd floor of a building which has other hotels in aswell, we liked this as it made the hotel seem very safe. As soon as we arrived the man at the check in gave us all a free map each, circled all the places he thought us 3 teenage girls would enjoy, circled some that he wasn't so sure we'd enjoy as much but told us they were extremely beautiful so if we had time we should go see them, and he also wrote down all the buses we would need to get to all these places and where the bus stops were then drew out the quickest route to get everywhere. He also booked us a taxi to get us back to the airport. We thought this was all extremely nice of him as we didn't ask him to. The hotel itself is quite modern but basic, what you'd expect for a cheap hotel. It was perfectly fine to live in for a few days though, a lot better than we expected. The only fault that I have about this hotel is that the shower in our room was extremely hot for about half an hour and it was a bit like someone chucking a bucket of water over you. My friends seemed to think the shower was fine but as I was the first one in and had to stand under the extreme heat I didn't enjoy it as much. The only other thing is that trying to open the main door when you've had a few drinks was a little tricky and it took us about half an hour to get in, it kept us all amused however including the receptionist who had to keep buzzing us in while we tried to open the door. The breakfast at Hotel Garda was very nice I thought, the reviews I'd read said the coffee was disgusting so I didn't dare try that but everything else was nice enough. The best thing about the hotel is the location though, despite the receptionist being so kind to tell us all the buses we decided to walk absolutely everywhere as the hotel is quite close to most things, the furthest thing away that we went to was the colloseum and that only took us about 45 minutes.
