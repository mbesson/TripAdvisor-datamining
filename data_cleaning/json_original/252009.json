The rooms are on the small side but very clean and well-maintained. The staff was awesome to deal with. The ladies who provided maid service were extremely accommodating and do a great job! The rocking chairs on the front porch are awesome also - we ended a few evenings up there. Bathrooms are dated but water pressure in shower was terrific.

So my son had a good time sitting on the edge and rolling to the middle of the bed. The room was clean but there was a lot of rust in the bathroom and on the top of the fridge. The bathroom and kitchen were good sized but horribly out of date. Early 60s style at best we had a hard time just figuring out how to turn on the hot water for showers.

The piano bar, with red velvet sofas and luxurious Victorian decor, is charming. The piano player and singer were fantastic. Don't be fooled by the Philip's name.

Batteries kept falling out of smoke detector. I am not a complainer nor am I all that picky, so I was willing to deal with a lot. I did call about the shower leak and the smoke detector. They came but didn't fix either. The restaurant closed at 1PM as we arrived to have a nice lunch on the porch. Because of the location (right on the boardwalk on the first level but far enough away from the commotion closer to the inlet) and the accomodations having a full kitchen, we really were willing to deal with a lot. We checked out on Friday instead of Saturday even though we had paid for the entire week and could have stayed until Saturday. The final straw was when I went to book for the next year....same week......(yes, I was still willing to stay there) they told me they would not allow me to book for 7 days because we checked out a day early and you are not allowed to do that. The fact that we had paid for 7 nights did not matter. I was treated rudely and in a condescending manner by the reservations manager. After much \"discussion\" I was told that they would \"allow me to book for the full 7 nights but that if I 'checked out on Friday again' I would be charged a penalty fee. This summer, we are going to try a new place. It won't be as convenient, so I would have much prefered Phillips but not worth being treated as if I had done something wrong. Phillips had a guest willing to tolerate almost any problem (I know the property is old and I understand that some things just are simply unavoidable) but they lost my business mainly because of my treatment when I tried to rebook.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "baltimore", "Title": "\u201cAll my life!\u201d", "Author": "webteach", "ReviewID": "UR14744616", "Content": "My husband and I have been going to the Beach Plaza since we were children.

Usually, we stay at condominiums, but with the location and generally good reveiws, we chose to stay at this hotel. We love Phillip's Seafood Restaurant, the crabs are good and the atmosphere is fun, and this review does not express our opinion of the restaurant. This hotel is a complete pigs-stye. Upon check-in, we went to our parking-lot view room. The hallways stunk of cat urine, and were dark and moist. The room was even worse. The carpet looked so dirty, one had to really think before taking off their own shoes. The rooms were also small and a complete fire-trap. There were no windows or vents in the bathrooms (which I know is required in all hotels), which were far from clean. On our second day at the hotel, the power went out when a circuit blew, causing us to be left in the dark for at least an hour if not longer. During this, the elevator of course stopped, and as employees literally yelled down the shaft to see if people were stuck or not, guests were forced to climb the stairs to their rooms. The price for our room was close to $200 a night, and this was parking-lot room and all. I understand that prices are obscene in all of Ocean City, but for our room, I thought this was way too much. We probably would have and gone to another hotel except for it's location, which was right on the boardwalk and near my brother's condo.

Our room was small but clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was cleaned and restocked with fresh towels everyday. The hotel rates were very reasonable, Everybody was very helpful from the parking attendant to the front desk people, the staff was very friendly and always willing to answer questions. The breakfast buffet was hot and fresh, the waiterss was so funny our 2 1/2 year old loved her! I would recommend you tried the buffet. We also ate breakfast outside on the deck and enjoyed the ocean view. But, like any other piece of prime real estate you must get there early to get a great seat! IF you have to wait for seating to become available you can sit on the porch in the rocking chairs. Just be careful you don't fall asleep. One of the better buffets to try is Ember's located @ 24thst & Coastal Hwy. A great way to work off your meal is to try the one of the two miniature golf courses located directly across the street. For those who have to satify a sweet tooth just take a strool or the tram on the boardwalk for some ice cream go to Dumser's and don't worry about the calories. For the popcorn lover there's Fisher's popcorn also make a quick stop at the Candy Factory. Finally, a great place to wear down the kid and the kid in you try on the south end of the boardwalk to see Ripley's belive it or not and all the surrounding amusement park Named Jolly Roger's.

If you like street rods or the cars from the 1940's to the 1970's then you have to visit Ocean City, MD for their Cruisin Weekend! It is held in May each year. We have been coming down here for many years for this event. We are always amazed by the number of autos they can pack in one small town for 3 days. This was our first stay at the Phillip's Beach Plaza Hotel on 13th Street and the Boardwalk. I had read some of the reviews and was skeptical about staying there. We were looking for something both reasonably priced yet centrally located. This hotel fit both requirements quite well. We were located in an ajoining building which had the effeciencies and apartments. I didn't remember booking an effeciency but was glad they put us there. It included 2 double beds, a small dining area, a small but full kitchen, and a full bathroom. The full size refrigerator was a plus because we like to keep drinks for the time we spend there. It was not spacious or high class but it was fine for the two of us for a 3 night stay. Yes, it is one of the older hotels and could use some renovating; but it was definetly worth $82.00 a night( tax included ) for an efficiency on the boardwalk! Everyone on the staff there was extremely friendly and helpful, from the maids to the hotel manager( who was filling in as parking attendant till his college help arrived )! The maids did a great job cleaning the room and keeping us supplied with towels. They even had a small basket with beauty aids in the bathroom like the expensive hotels next door. Each day there was a sanitized rubber mat for the tub/shower. I don't think I have ever stayed anywhere that had better water pressure in the shower. It was like getting a water massage! The Phillip's By The Sea Restaurant is exceptional for a quiet dinner for 2. Outstanding seafood dishes in the Phillip's tradition at an average price in Ocean City. I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet in the restaurant. It was reasonably priced, had a good selection, and everything was fresh and hot. Even better we didn't have to walk 10 blocks or get in the car. I would definetly stay here again for a reasonably priced getaway. Just a note!

Also, the front porch was \"taken over\" around 1130pm on 2 of the 3 nites by a group of foulmouthed,chain smoking early 20 somethings who were staying in the Phillip's apartments adjacent to the hotel.Their litter-beer cans, butts and bottles- was not yet cleaned up at 10 the next morning. Someone did complain to management.In addition, some of the front desk personnel were not exactly helpful, when they had \"computer problems\"both at check-in and check-out.The room was ok but should have been about 50$ less for what you got.We\"ll pass on this place next time.", "Date": "August 15, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to get away\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1103217", "Content": "We stayed here several years ago and the hotel is beautiful.
