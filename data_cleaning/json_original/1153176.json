Our first night we were in a tiny room on the top floor. Before dawn we were awakened by loud noises coming from above our room, as if furniture was being dragged across or thrown on the floor above us. The next day we complained and we were glad to be given another room on the floor below, which was quieter. The room was also slightly larger, but still extremely cramped and poorly designed: we had to keep one suit case on top of the refrigerator (which was itself in terrible shape). There was no chest of drawers and we were barely able to unpack during our 5-day stay. The electrical outlets were hidden behind a closet that we had to move to get access to plug in laptops and phones; the curtains were see through so that light came in early in the morning; the bedding was poor quality. For the first day and a half we could not get on-line; management advised us to use the connection of the hotel across the street and gave us its access code. Eventually they corrected the problem but the connection remained slow and erratic. Hotel \"services\" in general were unreliable and unprofessional. According to a sign posted in the lobby (and as repeated to us orally by management) breakfast is served on the terrace from 7.30 to 10 a.m. but when we arrived one day at 9.45 all the breakfast items had been put away. When we questioned the attendant there she first told us we were too late. When we pointed out the time on a clock she grudgingly put a few of the items back. When we later complained to the management we were told that they must have just \"forgotten\" about us. The following day we were awaked at 8.30 am with a phone call from the hotel and told that our breakfast was ready. We had not requested a wake up call and did not appreciate being awakened. By this point we realized this is a very amateurish operation and we needed to explain to them that we did not want to be called in the morning unless we asked to be. Nevertheless they called again the next morning at 9.30 to tell us that breakfast would be over in half an hour. However, on our last morning when we did ask for a wake up call so as to be sure to catch our taxi to the airport, we received none. Luckily we had set our own alarms. On another occasion we returned to our room late at night to find that (apparently when the room was made up) the air conditioner had been turned and left on and the room was freezing; the window had also been opened and left open, which we did not realize until the morning, after the resulting street noise had disrupted our sleep. Most of the staff was friendly and clearly trying to be helpful; they just seemed completely clueless about what running a hotel means and what travelers need. Their English was also generally poor to non-existent; at one point they called over an employee from the hotel across the street to provide basic information (the location of a pharmacy). The location is very convenient; it's in the heart of Sultahnamet and near all the historical sites. There is a view of the blue mosque from one end of the terrace. There is some street noise which can be somewhat controlled by closing the windows. Contrary to the hotel description, there is no bar or restaurant at the hotel, nor is there an elevator; there is an affiliated restaurant on another street around the corner.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cloved it and will be back\u201d", "Author": "lmussa", "ReviewID": "UR114839393", "Content": "wooow,, clean rooms.. beautiful view,,near sea, varity kindes of food, friendy people, and willing to help,, i will be back soon.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cexcellent accomedation and hospitality\u201d", "Author": "lmussa", "ReviewID": "UR114838942", "Content": "the hotel was perfect,, a car picked me up from airport,, rooms are clean,, varity kindes of food, wonderfull atmosfere and friendly people,, willing to help, and wonderfull sites around. advise every body to go there.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cThe World worst hotel (Hotelman is cheater!!!)\u201d", "Author": "Kedicik", "ReviewID": "UR112216925", "Content": "My book was 45Euros par night and I stayed Ocean's7 hotel 4night.

The rooms are a little on the small side but to be expected in a converted traditional building. A room with 2 singles seemed to have a bit more room than the double room. Rooms facing the street are a little noisy but what would you expect in a city? And the noise does die down around midnight. The staff are very friendly, helpful and courteous. Nothing was too much trouble. We ate twice at their family owned restaurant around the corner, again, courteous, and friendly service, and good food. We received the discount without being asked - how did they know we were staying around the corner? There are other restaurants in easy walking distance which we found helpful after a day full of sight seeing. Breakfasts were enjoyable and there was always enough to choose from. Maybe not enough seating in the cooler months when everyone wants to sit inside at more or less the same time, but it was manageable, I suppose this wouldn't be a problem in the warmer months.

HORRIFYING PART OF THE STORY: \u00c2\u00a0the next morning i went to explain to the staff that i had to leave because the mold & mildew was making me sick, and i didnt feel comfortable showering under water streaming from a light fixture. \u00c2\u00a0(the other light fixture in the bathroom looked homemade with exposed wires & sitting on top of a hole cut out in the cabinet -- but this one wouldnt even turn on). i explained that i was happy to pay for the night i had already stayed, but that i had to move to a different hotel. \u00c2\u00a0the first person i spoke with was quite shy and kind, but clearly not top level management. once the person who appeared to be the \"boss\" arrived -- he admitted that the room has water damage and mold because its on the top floor -- but proceeded to tell me that they \"sell this room all the time and no one ever complains\". \u00c2\u00a0which a.) flat out can't be true due to the room's condition, and b.) is irrelevant. \u00c2\u00a0he continued to say how my complaint was untrue, that it was not making me sick, that i was lying and if i didnt like the room, i should just say so... when i tried to explain my discomfort and the condition of the room (VERY CALMLY and POLITELY like a professional and sane human being), the man behind the counter started saying \"shut up shut up shut up\" the whole time i was talking, not listening to a word. \u00c2\u00a0i honestly thought i misunderstood, so i asked him if that's really what he was saying. \u00c2\u00a0he started cursing at me telling me to \"take your [expletive] bags and get the [expletive] out of my hotel!\", etc. i was so shocked and stunned that i got upset and started trying to defend myself (while he continued to be so verbally violent, aggressive, and mean), and the man STOOD UP, LEANED OVER THE COUNTER, RAISED HIS HAND LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TO SLAP ME IN THE FACE, AND CONTINUED CURSING AT ME AND THREATENING TO HIT ME IF I DIDNT STOP TALKING. the other staff member there was trying to stop him, saying \"no no\" but clearly he was afraid of this man, and was afraid to even say anything or do anything substantial. having just arrived in a very foreign country, i was extremely shaken by this and told the man i would be calling the police and also reporting this incident on all the online review sites. \u00c2\u00a0he was so smug the entire time saying \"call the police, do it, i dont care\" and cursing -- knowing that a tourist has no recourse or protection really -- what can you do? \u00c2\u00a0i live in NYC and the NYPD would certainly laugh at a call like this, they have things like murders and car accidents to deal with. so i took my things and left immediately, and went to the hotel next door to see if they could offer a suggestion of a place i could complain. \u00c2\u00a0they suggested the tourist police, but i decided it was best just to get out of the situation and not make things worse by further antagonizing the crazy man from Ocean's 7, or involving police in an unfamiliar country. this review is in no way exaggerated. unfortunately this shocking experience is 100% accurate. on my way out of my room i did see other rooms with their doors open on different floors, and they appeared not to have the same problems my room had. \u00c2\u00a0so maybe you will be lucky. \u00c2\u00a0 just know that if you are unlucky, that you may be physically in danger if you complain (no matter how polite or professional you try to be). most of the staff was overly overly friendly, but i know now they are only like that when it makes them extra money. \u00c2\u00a0if you happen to need REAL customer service (like when something goes wrong, or if it involves the hotel losing money, rather than making extra) -- you might get slapped. \u00c2\u00a0literally.

Not sure whom I should take to task - Trip advisor / Expedia? To rub salt into the wound, when we reached ab 2.00 AM, we were informed that our room was given to another family by mistake. Hence we had to stay in a room with no facilities and were asked to use a filthy communal shower and toilet. I was reduced to searching for rooms to stay at 2.00 AM in a foreign country with a 3 year old kid in tow. Since we could not find a room at such short notice, we had to stay there. The duvet did not have a cover. The curtains were see through and there was a light just outside the window which was attached to a motion sensor that was triggered by wind (I am not joking - I had to personally remove the bulb as the manager could not). The next day, we were given a different room. It was bigger than the one we occupied the previous night. To say it was \"no-fills\" will give it some credit. The shower had a panel that had come loose and we could see the electricity wires. We were assured that the panel will be stuck back the same day - but I am sure you will find it has not been done yet if you visit the place. Since our trip was for a few days, and rooms were difficult to come by, we had to continue staying in the hotel. The service was poor - having to cross check everything the manager/owner said.

One impotrant thing is that we noticed with supreme pleasure that the rooms and the common spaces are extremely clean. 4) And last but not least: please, enjoy your breakfast on the terrace admiring the Bosforo and the Blue Mosquee...and naturally eating some Turkysh tastes...

It is in an excellent location; taking just minutes to stroll to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. It is also only a short walk to the nearest tram stop making many other tourist destinations easily accessible. The hotel itself is clean and well-equiped. New Year in Istanbul is cold and I was glad to have a warm, comfortable room to retreat to when I needed. It was also good to be able to head up to the enclosed roof-top area and make myself a coffee when I fancied one. Breakfast is not fancy, but is plentiful. What really makes this hotel special, however, is the staff. They are very friendly and really couldn't do enough for me. Whenever I had a problem or a query it was dealt with immediately. They seemed genuinely interested in how I was and what I planned to do each day, and offered invaluable advice on where to go, what to see and where to eat and drink. I still have the little street map that Sharan annotated for me! I thoroughly enjoyed New Year in Istanbul and am very glad I chose Ocean's 7. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest", "Title": "\u201cFabulous city...\u201d", "Author": "zoltan_kosa_s1", "ReviewID": "UR24778050", "Content": "This was the first city where we stayed at a hotel instead of renting out an apartment, so I was a little concerned.

When you start your day,it would be with a view over the bosporus and Sultanahmet Mosque in the breakfirst room on the roof. But the outstanding thing in this hotel is the staff.

The rooms were clean and recently decorated, and we were offered a more spacious room on the second day - just because it became available! The restaurant that belongs to the family is just around the corner and really great - cosy and good food - I especially enjoyed the veggie options. However the BIG plus of a small family hotel like this is the staff! They went out of their way to help us and make sure we had everything we needed - and to let us use their printer - internet is already available, and to organise transport at the best rate, and to reassure us when a bag was lost - both in the restaurant and in the hotel they went beyond the call of duty.

On the surface this place was clean and tidy but the room was poorly lit, in fact it was virtually pitch black and we had to ask everyday for new toilet rolls and clean towls and for our miniscule bin to be emptied. Our sheets were not changed once over our four night stay which i was surprised about. This place was marketed as a hotel not a hostel. The staff were generally quite accomodating with our requests until the last morning. At around 11am one of the brothers/ owners came tou our room and asked if we wanted to book an airport shuttle service through him. We did and handed over our money. We informed them we would be going out and back around 3pm in order to get the shuttle by 4pm, he told us this would be fine. When we arrived back they told us we couldn't go to our room and handed us our passports. These had been placed in a drawer, not in the middle of the room. At this point we realised they had checked us out of our room with out our knowledge and just piled our stuff up outside the door. We were told that check out was at 10:30 and we should be thankful they hadn't charged us for the extra day. We were shocked! The man stood in our room and took our money after 10:30am and didn't mention a thing! Had we known we would have happily been packed by that time but the fact that they had been in our room, packed our belongings and been through our things was a complete violation. One of our concerns was that they had forgotten something at which point they allowed us to enter the room which we had stayed in, and where new people had been checked into, and check the room! This is a complete violation of the current occupants privacy and space! At this point we heard a distressed woman downstairs also complaining about her room claiming that she had been promised our room, but the hotel/hostel had told her the man staying there had missed his flight. Seeing as we were a group of three girls and had been scheduled to leave that day and not the day before it was plain to see we'd all been lied to. This left us with a bitter taste in our mouths and an upsetting end to what was otherwise a brilliant trip.
