Personally it was away from the main hub of the west end as you would have to use the Tube to get into Central London. Providing the lines were working!. Sadly the weekend we were there we had to bus it every where, as the tube station was having a 'makeover' in time for the Olympics, however in discussion with some locals, it is a regular occurance. With the traffic in London being what it is, and everyone having to use the links to get around, you were uncomfortably sardined, in a slow moving bus, other than sardined on the fast moving tube. Camden Market seemed like a ride to hell from there. In regards to the hotel, it is down a side street, away from everything other than a railway line directly behind the place, and a backstreet shortcut for cars directly in front. Both operational 24 hrs. The breakfast looks wonderful in the well placed menu's, and they advertise 'between 7 and 11\" however stroll down at 9 And you are lucky to have cereal, and the last baked bean in the dish. Well stocked it isnt. There is a vending machine in the foyer for drinks snacks, though as per usual, overpriced. I wouldn't stay here again, due to its locality, and proximity to the railway line. The extra cost you lay out getting around, you may as well put toward a more central, better class hotel.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cNice location but be aware DLR line and traffic.\u201d", "Author": "Haraldsenb", "ReviewID": "UR125447197", "Content": "My second Travelodge hotel in this area, and same story once again.

Even the noise didn't bother me to be honest and it is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. I always read horror stories on these review sites and I've never had a bad experience with travelodge.

At the time of booking it was the only hotel that had a tv & ensuite in the bedroom & that was situated within short walking distance from a zone 1 tube station in my price range & so even though I had seen a number of negative reviews on it I still decided to take the chance & so I booked. As I continued to read reviews up until my arrival I was a little nervous considering just how negative many of them were. I was considering cancelling my room there due to this but didn't want to lose the money. I am so glad that I didn't cancel! :) I booked my room online for 32 pounds a night (great deal!) & then called the hotel to confirm. I arrived on the 9th of January in a shuttle transfer bus from Heathrow Airport...I have to say that the bus driver simply had no clue where the hotel was & it wasn't showing up on the GPS but as I had an idea of the area I told him to drive by the other travelodge (Tower Hill...it is literally 5 min walk from Aldgate East travelodge)...we went in & got directions & then it was smooth from there. At reception I was greeted by an exceptionally friendly young man at the desk who efficiently checked me in & asked me if I needed any help with anything. He said to always let reception know if I needed a taxi or a theatre ticket or directions etc...they were more than willing to help. Reception area is clean & has leather couches. There is also free water in reception to freshen up with after a long journey. I was given room number 416 (facing apartments on the Chamber Street road side not the Railways tracks). I had asked for a top floor room that was relatively quiet & this is what I got. When the window is closed you can't hear a thing. When the window is open however I could hear the trains from behind the hotel but this was nothing major. Could also hear cars & sirens but again...not to a large extent. I imagine rooms on the railway track side would be slightly noisier but again...I can't imagine this would be too difficult to get over if you are tired enough. The room was heated to a wonderful degree. I was able to sleep comfortable in the room with just the one blanket on. The lighting in the room was excellent. I was dissapointed to see that there was just a shower but no bath but considering that I was paying such a small amount this did not bother me. The bathroom is a reasonable size. The shower I have to say wasn't the hottest...the water pressure was good however. Whilst they do not provide toiletries they do provide a small bar of soap in the bathroom which is good. There is a cupboard & large desk & chair in the room as well as a fan. The tv was very clear...had the basic channels you would expect. The Bed itself - Clean and comfortable...the pillows were good too so I don't understand why people complain about them. I was given 4 pillows! The Cleaners - All the cleaners that I came into contact with were friendly. I will say that none of them had particularly good english skills & even though I did once request they not enter my room, I did come home that day to find the sheets had been changed but again...not a huge issue. Their language skills weren't 100% but they were friendly & efficient. The hotel itself: The hallways are rather narrow so if you try to get through the hallway with a large bag whilst the cleaners are there - forget it... I quickly found that out after the first attempt. The hotel in general is quite clean & friendly looking though. The staff throughout the 2 weeks there were all smiley & friendly....received great service & had a good joke or two with them. The Area: I am a single female traveller from Australia who is only 20 yrs old...after reading the reviews about Chamber Street...again, I was nervous. But guess what? I walked through those arches & under the tunnel almost every night that I was there well after 10pm each time & I felt 100% safe & wasn't scared at all. There are car washes all along the arches & the men in there are always smiley & friendly & would give me a wave at night to let me know it was all ok. If you have seen EastEnders...just think of Phil's place & the Arches...it's like that. Wasn't scared at all. The hotel is within 5-10 min walking distance from both Aldgate East station & Tower Hill station & there are 4 lines (district, circle, hammersmith & city, metropolitan) that run from these stations so that you have easy access to the centre of London. Again, very simple to get to the stations. There is a Tesco less than 5 min walk from the hotel. There is a Waitrose about 10 min walk from the hotel. On Whitechapel High St (5 mins walk from hotel....next to Aldgate East station) there is an Internet Cafe (exit Aldgate East station via Whitechapel Gallery Exit) that charges 50p for 30 mins which is quite good value. There is also a pub, KFC, Burger King & Costa Coffee next to the station. In Leman street (next to Chamber St) there are 2 Indian Restaurants, a Lebanese Restaurant, a Pub (The Brown Bear), a Bar further up the street (The Oliver Conquest) & a little Fried Chicken/Kebab takeaway shop that sells a huge Cod & Chips for 4 pounds - great value! I can't say that I ate at all in the restaurant of the hotel so I cannot review that but unless you really want to eat in the hotel I would say go elsewhere as there is plenty about. The hotel does lock the front door at 10pm but you can enter by putting your room card in the door. Very simple & safe. As this is the East End...I recommend visiting Commercial Road (which is 10-15 min walk from the hotel)....it is full of Indian/Pakistani & Arab restaurants & shops. I loved it. I would not hesitate to stay here again & I am sure that I will on my next trip to London. I can't understand the complaints of some reviewers here. I understand if you are paying a lot of money at the last minute that you might be dissapointed with it but seriously...it's great value for London. Personally, I actually have stayed at the Ritz & I have to say...for what you pay here...it's fantastic value!", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piemonte", "Title": "\u201cGood value, better than expected after reading reviews\u201d", "Author": "bglad2uk", "ReviewID": "UR122936658", "Content": "First of all, when we book the Travelodge, we are not expecting five-star treatment.

I am glad I didn't. Sure, it is not a luxurious establishment, but I have no complaints at all. My bed was suitably comfortable, the room was clean and there was hot water almost instantly, and consistently in the shower. My room looked over Chamber Street (where this is located) so it was on the opposite side to the railway lines so maybe this ensured reduced noise, however a cleaning lorry did wake me up when it passed in the early hours; that can happen anywhere in a big city, though.

Firstly the location. Its inbetween whats the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153City\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the start of suburban East London. About 5 mins from either Tower hill or Aldgate east tube station depending on your preference. The DLR station of Tower Gateway was also minutes away. The Tower Hill side is dominated by the City boys in their suits, the Aldgate east side is simply London. A lot of reviews mention Chamber st and the railway arches. We found no problems under the arches what so ever. There were two 24/7 car wash garages underneath and judging by their punters expensive cars there can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too much wrong with this area. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dark or intimidating and I walk around far Worse Street in my home town. If this street scares you then so will every other street in London. Surrounding the infamous arches are a Premier Inn and another travel lodge and Tesco and a Weatherspoon pub. Not really the hang-outs of a wanabe mugger. If your still put off by the arches then next to the Prem Inn is Magdalene passage which is 20 metres long and fetch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s you out more or less outside this Travelodge. Inside the hotel the lobby area is immaculate. A decent size eating area and small bar(24 hour).Staff all friendly and helpful. We had small check in prob as they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find our reservation but luckily we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d printed confirmation of booking. Not sure how they would of handled had we not had this. The room was an unusual shape for bog standard Travelodge(longer not square) and the carpets were barely tacked to floor so it suggests this was a previous chain hotel quickly converted to Travelodge standard decor. Room was clean, larger than usual London travel lodges and pleasant enough. The shower was fine but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fussy the water did have a habit of giving you a cold blast occasionally but nothing to get worked up about. The odd numbered rooms overlook the railway line running unto Tower Gateway. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true you can hear the trains BUT it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that noisy.Theres a slight rumbling sound but we sort of got used to it. In my opinion if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fussy about noise or easily disturbed then it will annoy you eventually even though it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me. You can request an even numbered room at reception. Out and about as I mentioned there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Tescos and some convenience stores on Lehman St.Lehman st had several caf\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and take away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serving full breakfast to sandwich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.Lehmans caf\u00c3\u00a9 on Lehman St did excellent full English for \u00c2\u00a34.75,sadly though most places closed on Sundays. Several pubs in the area included the Brown Bear on Lehman St, and the Princess of Persuia.Both was local\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pubs and we found the friendly and welcoming. There were also a Weatherspoons and many bars around Minnories which were fine but very busy when the City workers clocked off their shift. There were also loads of Indian restaurants dotted about but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never sampled any so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say if they are any good. All in all then. Not too bad. If you can get this hotel at a reasonable price then its quite good value for central London. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not 5 stars but on the flip side it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a doss house either. If you consider the other options of a slightly tidier travel lodge practically next door but for \u00c2\u00a330 extra a night or a premier Inn also very near for an extra \u00c2\u00a370 a night I know which option I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d choose.

We had been travelling for 4 weeks and by the time we arrived and I was incredibly dubious after re-checking the Trip Advisor reviews and reading what a disaster this place was. Upon arrival at the hotel we were warmly greeted by Chris - our check in was swift and efficient, which was brilliant as we had been travelling all day and wanted to relax. During our check in process Chris turned away 2 different couples who were seeking accommodation as the hotel was fully booked. It amazes me that a hotel can be fully booked - especially a hotel who gets reviews like some I read - either some people exaggerate or some people don't care where they stay - we are not either types of these people! We had booked 2 rooms for our family - one room had a small issue with the lights, however Chris efficiently fixed this for us with no problem at all. Both rooms were comfortable, clean and exactly what you would expect from a chain hotel. The beds were comfortable and yes, the air conditioning is non-existent, however no one in our party found the fans noisy or problematic - on fact it was nice to feel a little bit of air movement in the room. We had our windows open the entire stay and I can say as an exceptionally light sleeper I hardly woke during the night - the only time I recall waking was for people coming and going inside the hotel. It might be different for rooms on the other side of the hotel, but we had no problems. The hotel is located down a dark-ish alleyway but at no time when we were coming and going during the night, did we feel unsafe or scared. It might have something to do with living in London previously and knowing that dark areas don't necessarily mean dangerous areas. The only complaint I would make is our room had absolutely no hanging space for clothes which is a pain when you are there for 4 or 5 days. The location of the hotel is excellent - it's within a 5 minute walk of the DLR and the Tube and a 7 or 8 minute walk from the Tower of London! There is free wifi in the bar area albeit it is slow. But it's ideal if you just want to check your emails and do some light surfing. We can also highly recommend the local Witherspoons for great and affordable breakfasts, lunches or dinners - they also have free wifi.

The trains ran well after midnight and started up again at 5.30 in the morning. We had to close the windows to try and deaden the noise (with no great effect) but this meant the room was even hotter! There was a fan in the room but we couldn't leave this on overnight as it was also very noisy. All this meant very little sleep for four nights. On the third day of our visit, we didn't need any towels changing etc and I wanted to leave my phone on charge during the day. I left a sign on the door requesting no staff to come in the room that day. As soon as we returned, I noticed straight away that a member of staff had been in the room. Although my phone was still there I felt disgusted that someone had been in the room despite our request and had access to our possessions against my will. I complained to the cleaning staff the next day and requested again for them to not enter our room. We did not receive any apology. It was the last day of our trip and we had pre-paid \u00c2\u00a310 so we could check out of the hotel at 2pm.

I went straight to the reception desk to explain my problem and tell them I had the room booked till 2pm. The woman on the counter was very rude and instead of apologising, she said it must have been our fault the key was not working, despite the fact it had worked all week. I was shocked by her 'don't care' attitude and was left feeling very upset and angry.

The thought process behind this being that you always know what to expect with the Travelodge, and we're never in our room much anyway. Aldgate East Travelodge is easy to get to on the tube, the nearest stop being the 'Aldgate East' station, naturally. This station will link you up with the District and Hammersmith & City lines which can get you to anywhere with a few changes here and there. From the tube it is a 5 minute walk to the hotel, once you've sussed where it is. We took a taxi from Kings Cross Station to the hotel (\u00c2\u00a315) when we got there which is a good thing really as the hotel is pretty much located in a random back lane with no signposting. I really think we would have struggled to find it on our own. We did however save a little money by getting the tube back to Kings Cross when we were leaving. So yeah, very strange location as it is not on a main road. This also makes it a little scary when coming back to the hotel on an evening as it is dark and the area in general is very quiet. I would therefore advise single travellers to take care as Aldgate has got a bit of a reputation for being a 'dodgy' area, or so the locals told us! Check-in was quick and easy and there is a small elevator in reception and a few vending machines. There was also a bar/restaurant area offering a wide range of meals, and a smaller late night menu which offered food until the wee hours of the morning. Our room was pretty much the bog standard Travelodge set up, double bed with two small tables either side. Directly opposite we had a long table with the TV on it, a desk and chair area with large mirror for getting dressed and a few drawers. There was also a decent sized wardrobe with a safe inside that did not work. The bathroom comprised shower, toilet, sink and was basic but fairly clean. We visited in June so it was just starting to get warm, and our room was very stuffy. We noticed the air conditioning panel on the wall but could not get it to work so queried this at reception. We were then advised that the hotel did not offer air con and this had been a feature installed by the previous hotel owners that had now been made redundant.. great! We were then encouraged to ventilate our room by leaving the window open all day so that by the time we got back on an evening the room would be cool. I found this to be astounding, we were on the 6th floor so the chances of anyone breaking in via the window were obviously minimal but stranger things have happened. At night it was so warm that we had to leave the window open, and because it opened inwards it meant the pointed edge of the metal frame was hanging over my side of the bed. This of course proved to be disastrous in the middle of the night when I got up to use the toilet and impaled the side of my body on the jagged edge leaving me with a bleeding wound and a scar that is still here. Disgraceful!! Needless to say I have made a formal written complaint about this. Also, because we had to leave the window open it meant we had to suffer immense disruption and noise from the nearby national train station. Luckily, I'm a very deep sleeper but my friend barely slept at all. All in all the experience would have been probably been rated 'Average' had it not been for the temperature issue and the window incident. Those who live in countries where air con comes as standard would probably find it very uncomfortable so should definitely consider finding alternative accommodation!", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTravel Lodge at its worst\u201d", "Author": "Tim_H_from_Lincs_UK", "ReviewID": "UR115242263", "Content": "To start with the good points, it was very cheap for central London and the rooms were typical Travel Lodge: clean and basic.

Like the airy, spacious dining area too. Check out was swift and friendly. Certainly no issues experienced by other reviews.

Have used TL's all over the country for this purpose including the one at Tower Hill but panicked after booking when we read the reviews. Shouldn't have though as it was sound. As it was Easter the tubes were all disrupted and Aldgate East station was closed so on arrival at St Pancras we were advised to take the tube to Liverpool St and a bus to Aldgate. The 135 bus dropped us at the Algate Exchange pub. We crossed the road and walked along Mansell Street (400 yards). At the junction there is a Weatherspoons pub and you can see Chamber Street. This bit looked dodgy as we had to walk past railway arches and it was a bit grim, but we could see the hotel after 2 minutes. When we found our bearings we found that you can avoid this bit easily, from the Weatherspoons go toward the Premier Inn on Prescott St and turn right into Magdalens Passage, it brings you out at the hotel door. Alternatively, from Aldgate East tube, follow Leman St (400 yards) and turn right into Chamber St at the Brown Bear (another pub! ha). Checkin took all of 2 minutes, the easiest ever. We asked for a quiet room and were given 1 on the 3rd floor at the front of the hotel. The room was bigger than a TL ( as this had prev been a Comfort and maybe in need of a makeover) but it was clean, the bathroom was clean and the shower was powerful with plenty of hot water. We didn't eat here at all but with a Weatherspoons 5 mins away, 2 Indian restaurants at the end of the road and a Tesco opposite spoons you don't need to. It is a 5 minute walk to the Tower of London from here and with 3 tube stations (tube services permitting) you have easy access to the rest of London. We got to Arsenal in about 30 minutes on a match day!

Unfortunately, Chamber st is basically an alleyway with garages, so it doesn't feature on many tourist maps or A-Z, and any taxi drivers we asked didn't know where it was either! We ended up at Chambers street, found it was the wrong one, so ended up walking back towards the DLR. Strangely, found the other VERY nearby travelodge first (London Bridge), and the friendly man on the desk pointed us in the right direction, telling us that he has had to do that 20 times already that day! Staff in Aldgate east are friendly enough, lift only seems to go up, not down. Room looked ok on the surface, but wasn't exactly sparkling. The only way to get hot water from the tap is to turn it on full blast and get wet, which is rather annoying! Quite a lot of noise from the DLR, but this is explained on the booking page.

With Travel Lodge you tend to expect a bog-standard level of service and quality. However this hotel falls far below my expectations of Travel Lodge, which usually meet or even exceed my expectations. Location: Firstly, this hotel is not situated in close proximity to Aldgate East Tube Station. We arrived at the tube station expected the hotel to be visible, and walking down a few streets we realised we were rather lost! So we went into the Aldgate East Ibis Hotel to ask for directions, whom may I say where very friendly and happy to help. However it was then a further 15 minutes walk through a rather worryingly dark and quiet area of London. Thankfully I was not on own, as admittedly I would have feared for my safety. We gladly spotted the hotel, which is actually situated along a dark and miserable looking side street (or should I say 'alley way)... I think the street name gives a clue there: 'Chamber Street'. Appearance/Cleanliness: From the outside the hotel looks like a secure psychiatric unit, only distinguished by the familiar Travel Lodge sign. Inside the reception things looked up slightly, but only to the point of resembling a 'not so bad' hostel. As for the room, it was okay... bedding, linen and towels were all fine. No major complaints apart from the shower basin looking like it needed a good scrub and the window restricter being completely broken, which meant the window could be opened fully, wasn't a big deal for us - but certainly would be frowned upon by health and safety, and not good for anyone feeling suicidal or with children. Also the room seemed to lack double glazing certainly didn't aid sleep! Service: Our only real encounter with staff was when we arrived to check in, instead of a friendly welcome the response was \"Let me just finish checking my email, be with you in a few minutes\" *rolls eyes*. My colleague and I don't usually bother with breakfast but feeling peckish we decided to give it a go. The sign read \"Wait to be seated\" so we waited, and waited and waited, and after 10 minutes we gave up and helped ourself to some fruit and juice, which for me seemed the only edible things on offer.

What WAS very annoying, is that the heating didn't work properly. It was turned off when we entered the room and it was 16 degrees inside. When turning the heat on (aiming at 22 degrees), it would only blow (it's a combined aircon/heating system) for about 15-30 seconds every 5 minutes. So, when not unbearably cold, we never got really comfortable in the room either. The temperature did not rise above 18 degrees at any point and we even left the heating on during the day while we were out! It was a bit of a chilly weekend, but temperatures didn't drop below 3 or 4 degrees. I don't even want to contemplate what happens if it starts freezing!

I would advise checking a map and directions thoroughly before going to the hotel - it is not exactly the easiest to find. The hotel is close to a train track. As my friend and I have lived close to a railway line for over twenty years, this did not bother us. As mentioned in previous reviews, you can hear the trains from the rooms. However, I would not advise asking for a room at the front of the hotel to escape the noise (as was also mentioned in a previous review).
