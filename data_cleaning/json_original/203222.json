(We were a little miffed to hear that we had to pay the tourist tax \u00a32pppn as we were told it was already included but this was no big deal and possibly the fault of the agent rather than the hotel) The staff were friendly and we encountered no problems, breakfast was standard for European hotels with cereal, croissants, rolls jams, ham and cheese everyday with fresh coffee. The room was small and 2 single beds were shoved together but I'm beginning to realise this is fairly normal for budget hotels. The bathroom was clean and impressive with a new marble-looking finish. One annoyance is the staff's habit of turning your air conditioning off while you are out so the room is always hot when you first get back, but we had a fairly powerful little machine in our little room so it cooled down quickly. I found a solution to this was hiding the remote although they must have got a spare one one of the days. Oh you also have to ask for the remote at reception which they will neglect to tell you but offer when you ask. We wanted a certain standard of room because it was our little get-away and we wanted somewhere nice to come back to but the location was the most important thing to us as we planned on being out site-seeing all day every day, and the location is fantastic!! Walking 30 seconds round the corner you can see the Colosseum and after a 5-10minute walk through Domus Aurea (Nero's garden) you are there! And there is a metro line at the Colosseum from which you can get to almost everywhere for a couple of Euros. Not by any means a top hotel but would recommend for those on a budget as deals can be found that beat the price of some hostels!", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Serres, Greece", "Title": "\u201cNo water because of the ice.\u201d", "Author": "Tasos_Serres", "ReviewID": "UR124255648", "Content": "I went in Rome in 03.02.2012 for the weekend with my girlfriend and a friendly couple.

We told the receptionist about the problem, and he said that they couldn't do anything with the excuse that the hole city was in the same situation. Third day and we still didn't have water. then, at the end of the day they offered us the chance to go to another hotel nearby, and give us a discount to our price for the two days for about 10euros per night. That was unacceptable, but we didn't knew our rights and it was very difficult to call anyewhere outside Italy. So, after a lot of negotiations with the manager herself, we had a discount of 15euros per night. That was the only black spot to our accomodation in Edera.

The hotel is located about a five minute walk from the Colosseum and the bus-stops for city tours.

The TV is OK if you want some background noise but is only Italian stations (but you do get the odd European video on MTV.) I was in room 2 but I had a peek in room 5 and it's HUGE!!! Ask for that one if you like a lot of space. The curtains are long and heavy and allow you to have a lie-in if you want without being woken up by sunlight. The room I was in looked over into a lovely little courtyard with a huge palm tree, a couple of tables and chairs and was perfect for relaxing after a hard day sightseeing. The resident cats were a welcome sight (but then again I am a cat-lover) but didn't pester us. Theres a sitting area inside with a small bar. The staff behind the desk spoke good English and were happy to help with any queries I had. They don't have a problem with takeaway pizzas being taken back to the room (although this was only done due to illness). There is a little shop up the road on the same side that sells beer, wine, fruit and veg and other stuff.

Although reading many reviews to be careful as they use this hotel's location as a 'trap' and then tranfer the clients to other hotels in the same chain, we decided to give it a go, as our main concern was having a parking spot for our rental car! We had no problems. The room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was buffet style with a good variety of choices. It had a frigobar & tv. Parking space available for EU 10 per night. It's right around the corner from the park where Domus Aurea is. Crossing this park, you're right in front of the Colisseum, where you will also find a subway station. This park closes at night, but you can go around it. There are lots of nice bars close to the park. We were very lucky with this choice!", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brixen, Italy", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "JoFritz", "ReviewID": "UR16686603", "Content": "Nice, clean, silent (!!!) hotel, very friendly staff, good breakfast (considering that Italians don't take b/f), excellent location (15min walk from train station, 3min walk to Colosseum, good connections with publ transport).

A number of its reviews were not favourable but it appeared to have all we were looking for. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very helpful reception clerk who checked us in promptly and never questioned our early arrival, before 1pm. Our room was perfectly adequate for our needs and fulfilled our expectations \u2013 Whilst not spacious it had a big enough wardrobe, a TV \u2013 but no English channels and a small refrigerator which had room to keep the necessary bottles of water chilled. Even more important it had an individual air-conditioning unit, which allowed us complete temperature control and ensured a good night\u2019s sleep. The bathroom had washbasin, bidet and shower and was very clean. Each day the room was cleaned thoroughly and the towels and sheets were changed. We dealt with three different reception clerks, all of whom were extremely helpful. Taxis were ordered immediately and arrived within five minutes. A map of Rome was forthcoming and included an explanation of the nearest metro station and the best shopping streets. Nothing was too much trouble. Hotel Edera proved to be all we desired \u2013 a quiet, cool and centrally located base from which to explore and attend the wedding. The latter proved to be an absolutely memorable experience. Along the street to the right is a fruitereer, a corner shop and an excellent Trattoria, where you can eat in or take away a variety of pizzas and pastas \u2013 try the lasagne, it\u2019s truly mouth-watering.

One in particular would rate this Hotel higher than it\u2019s three stars. One can only speak from one\u2019s own experience and as I stayed in only one room in this Hotel, that is my bench mark. I would only rate this Hotel at the most a two Star for the following reasons. Whilst the Hotel was situated in an ideal location, a very pleasant five minute walk from the Colosseum, the hotel itself, judging it by our room and our friends across the landing, I'm afraid requires some loving care and attention. Apart from the reception area, the overall feel is that there hasn't been any kind of refurbishment or decoration work done for quite a number of years. I use the term \"dog eared\" to describe our room. Though spacious, the very old wall paper was peeling off of the walls and the paintwork had been very badly touch in. The toilet/shower room though clean was old and completely worn out. However, the continental breakfasts were excellent and well replenished and the staff were friendly and helpful. The overall impression I felt was that the management were making cutbacks to the point that there was no room service available and the lounge bar was permanently closed. If you wanted to have a drink in the lounge area or court yard garden, then you were asked to use the mini bar in your room and bring your drinks down. In it's present decorative state, I\u2019m afraid I could not recommend this Hotel.

It was shady and cool, and we often ate our breakfast out there. The breakfast was adequate - a normal continental breakfast consisting of a variety of hams, cheese and croissants. There were also yoghurts, cereals, fruit juices, bread rolls and fruit. The breakfast is between 7 and 10 and is served in the dining area on the ground floor.

The room was furnished with 2 single beds, a wardrobe, dresser and television. the room had an air conditioning unit, which we found to be very useful as the night were quite warm.
