Starting with the hotel, for the money we paid, it was just about ok. The rooms are spacious but poorly decked out with cheap furniture that was chipped, scratched or worn out. As I had heard about the 15 Euro upgrade for a better room and daily mini-bar, I called on the day we travelled to be sure it would be available. It was, but at high season price of 20 Euros given it was Easter. When we arrived I was then told it was 25 Euros because of Easter - only to argue the case and be told it was actually 15 Euros upgrade plus 5 Euros for internet and 5 Euros for the mini-bar. Make up your minds people. Which fake sales line is it meant to be? Despite this, we used the upgrade and landed a top floor room (703) with great view of Castel Sant'Angelo and St Peter's, but the room was actually smaller than the one we left on the fourth floor (416) and there were red bugs all over the balcony floor. The mini-bar is poorly stocked with things you may not actually eat or drink so we only had that for one night. If you want water every day, just refill your first bottle of water from the 100s of fountains across the city as you travel around. The front desk staff were courteous enough at first, but rude and impatient if you asked questions or disputed anything. Thankfully, the restaurant and room service staff were top notch - really nice, polite and friendly......and that was in the face of some rather obnoxious guests at breakfast making a nuisance of themselves. The room service food was pretty bad, so we only had that on the night we arrived as we got there at 11.30pm. Thankfully Raf Pizza is a restaurant on the back corner of the hotel and is fantastic for pizza, pasta and all the sides. The hotel breakfast was THE saving grace of the whole experience. Absolutely fantastic spread, seemingly constantly restocked, and I would actually go back and stay for this and the location combined - if I were to ever go back that is. The location is perfect. You are literally a 5 minute brisk, or 10 minute gentle walk from The Vatican City, 5 minutes from Castel Sant'Angelo, 1 minute from Via Cola di Rienzo and all the shops, 15 minutes from the all the central attractions, and about 25-30 minutes walk from the Colosseum. If you don't want to walk, you are 10 minutes from a metro station. When you get back, the area is quiet, and close to a number of decent places to eat if you haven't had something whilst out exploring. To sum up, I was expecting more from both the hotel and the city, but I just left feeling I had spent 6 days in a miserable tourist trap and stayed in a hotel that should have been better for the money spent.

We arrived at the hotel early due to our early flight time and was able to check in early. The hotel is easy to get to from the airport for both of us it cost us 10euros for a coach and the metro. We decided to get the upgrade and Paid the extra 15 euros per night for free minibar and room upgrade, the room itself was like a flat nice living area with balcony and a very big room every day at 2pm the minibar would get restocked with alcohol,soft drinks,water and snacks. The hotel is just off the main shopping street where you can get everything from the such as clothes,food,market stalls,shoes. There are also a lot of restaurants around so never short of places to eat. The hotel is a 10min walk to the Vatican and there are 2 ways to get there from the hotel and the river fibre is right behind the hotel. The hotel itself is very modern and all the staff are very helpful as a young couple they helped us get on to guest list for 2 nightclubs. Helped us book a cheap coach back to the airport. Confirmed our reservations door our excursions and were very helpful on the whole. We had breakfast included in our stay which had a good variety of food, on the weekend the menu changes a bit to more of a fry up, which I preferred. The hotel has 30min free wifi in the lobby only which you have to get a code for from reception. The room has a clean everyday even when you are staying for longer then a night which is a good thing. I can only say we had a little issue which was them a c not working the room constantly felt hot and stuffy and for me resulted in some sleepiness nights, but I just ended up opening windows together some cool air. I really enjoyed staying at this hotel and think I would stay at this hotel again I think the only thing I missed was a pool as the weather was so nice but it was not essential.

We had booked a twin room but on arrival found the room to be a double, we returned to reception where a smiling and extremely polite member of staff changed the room at the touch of a button.

We didn't use the Metro, bus or tram once as the hotel is so well situated we found that we could walk, the furthest site being the Coliseum, which was approximately 40 minutes walk away - and that was dawdling!

The only downside is the location - approximately 10-15 minutes walk to the nearest metro station. But at the same time, it was only 15 minutes to the Vatican and Castel Sant Angelo. It is situated in a residential area: - quiet and (as far we could tell) safe neighbourhood, - local restaurants were not cheap (ranged from \u00a313-\u00a320 per main dish), although the quality of food was quite good, the staff did not welcome English tourists. Would recommend ensuring your map(s) cover all nearby roads and metro stops. When we stayed, the metro stopped running at 9pm on Sundays so we had to find the replacement shuttle bus stops which luckily were easy to find but be wary of which way the bus will be travelling. Getting on the bus going in the opposite direction would mean a 10 minute bus journey could take over an hour! Luckily, we realised this before the bus arrived. If staying, I would recommend upgrading for 15euro per night to stay in a suite with double balcony and nice view. This also includes daily refill of the mini-bar - the contents are worth around 60 euros. With the extortionate prices in Rome, you'd be lucky to spend less than 15 euros on soft drinks and water during the day. The breakfast provided everything we would want (bacon, eggs, sausages toast etc) - plus you could help yourself to champagne which was a nice touch. They also provided a jug of hot milk for coffee which I thought was brilliant. The drink prices in the bar were cheaper than in the tourist areas of Rome and served complimentary bar snacks with your drinks. We did have a minor issue with ants - every evening, we would find two ants foraging around the sink area. As the numbers were small, it wasn't a major inconvenience.

We were on the 3rd floor and had a balcony facing Via Virgillio. Rooms: The room was fairly big and had a nice balcony. It has hardwood floors throughout, a large desk area and big bathroom. The only problem with hardwood floors (and thin walls) is that you can hear EVERYTHING going on around the room. We could here the conversations in the next room word-for-word and they did not seem to be speaking loudly. The street noise was minimal and a small price to pay for having a great balcony. Hotel lobby: Clean and modern. Lots of seating areas for lounging and relaxing. Staff: Good. The front desk staff have basic English and try their best to be helpful. Everyone smiles and greets you as you arrive and leave the hotel. Location: Close (walking distance) to the Vatican. 5-10 minute walk to the closest Metro station. Lots of shopping and restaurants in the area. Less touristy than staying close to the Spanish Steps area. Can walk to Spanish Steps in 15-20 minutes. Transportation: We took the limo to the airport that the hotel arranged for 50 Euros\u2014well worth it! Very convenient. Issues: The only issue we had was during check-out the front desk staff member quoted us our \u201ctotal\u201d (over 1000 Euros) and asked for a credit card when we had booked the hotel and pre-paid it through AirCanada.com. He insisted on us producing a \u201cvoucher\u201d in-lieu of the credit card. Firstly, this should have been addressed during check-in. Secondly, I have never had to produce a \u201cvoucher\u201d at any other hotel where I have pre-paid the stay. He wasn\u2019t unpleasant about the issue, but he wasn\u2019t friendly about it either.

This is so true of our stay three night stay at the NH Giustiniano, Rome. We arrived on Easter Sunday - arguably one of the busiest days on the tourist calendar. We were also considerably early and, being fully booked, a suitable room was not yet ready but we were able to leave our luggage in their secure storage while we piled in with the hordes at St. Peter Square. The hotel is a stone's throw away from Castel Sant' Angelo and about a ten minute leisurely walk (for a reasonably healthy and fit individual) from Vatican City. Nearest metro stop is Lepanto. We felt that its location was excellent for our purposes, although avid restaurant goers may wish to choose to stay a little more south or east. Having said that, Piazza Navona is only a ten minute walk away, and we had no problem finding or enjoying great food in the evenings. As a routine sales pitch, the reception staff politely, and gently (ie. not pushy) offered a couple of room upgrade options for \u20ac10/\u20ac15 extra per night. We declined as we had no need for the extra space and facilities (although I'm sure it would have been quite luxurious). Check-in was a polite, swift and efficient process. Our room was on the sixth floor and had an inward courtyard facing view. For the record, do not expect a quaint cloister-like courtyard/garden as this is a large, modern hotel in a city. The windows provided much light and ventilation (had external roller shutters as well as internal muslin nets and blackout curtains), and the room felt secure. The room was large and the d\u00e9cor modern (boutique hotel style), with a solid wooden floor, fantastically large and comfortable bed (medium firm mattress), plenty of storage for clothes, a desk, luggage stand, armchair, LCD TV, digital safe (large enough for a business laptop), fridge (mini-bar), digital air con. The bathroom was a good size and had quality fittings. The only problem was a leaky seal on the shower screen which created a puddle on the floor whenever we showered. From other reviewers, it would appear that this a common problem with the shower screens fitted throughout the hotel. However, this was a minor issue and did not detract from the overal quality of the stay. Despite being fully booked, we experienced no issues with noise coming internally or externally. Housekeeping staff were polite (whenever seen), discrete and efficient. We returned to a spotlessly cleaned room (and bathroom) every day. Wired and wireless internet was available in the room and wireless available in the lobby. The service is provided by Swisscom, a third party network provider, and a one-time daily code needs to be obtained at reception for a free 30 minute session. This policy is to encourage purchase of 24hr sessions. Paid internet access is almost de-riguer in hotels these days so a free 30 minute session is a bonus. Business users, or those who can't live without their social network would benefit from a room upgrade, which is inclusive of internet access throughout, at almost the same rate as purchasing internet access alone. There is a workstation, complete with printer, in the lobby that also operates on the paid system. Buffet breakfast was included in our booking. It's worth the option if not already included. The restaurant/diner is top notch. Seating is plentiful, the d\u00e9cor modern in keeping with the rest of the hotel, and super clean. You would not be dissapointed to walk into this restaurant setting at any level. The restaurant staff were polite, friendly and professional. Even on the fully booked day(s), it was not overcrowded and the food selection was plentiful and well stocked/replenished. The selection was wide and varied and the quality of the food was excellent. Juices were freshly pressed, and a selection of fresh whole or prepared fruits were available everyday. Bread was fresh and there was a wide selection of different pastries (even multiple croissant options), cold meats, cheeses, cereals, yoghurts, teas, coffees \u2013 and get this... even bubbly (altho probably a sparkling white)!! The hot food selection was a little limited (do remember that this is continental Europe) but scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon were available so you could still cobble together a pseudo full English (more like a half English!) if that's what you fancy. I must state that the quality of the offerings was excellent \u2013 all of the produce was of top rate and not a hint of budget supermarket stuff anywhere. I'm sure I left out some food selections but I would rate the overall breakfast experience as five star quality. A hotel bar exists but this was pretty much deserted as there are plenty of places to wine and dine in Rome. There are also several large and modern conference facilities for the business user. There is also a fitness room with a modest offering containing a treadmill, cross trainer and (I don't quite recall the third machine but probably...) a rowing machine. I did foolishly consider going for a run on the treadmill one morning but, given that we had walked, and were going to walk, for miles n miles for the entire week, rapidly decided against it. Check-out was also a fast and efficient process (I booked direct with NH and recommend this method). In summary, this hotel is a very well run and kept establishment. Rooms are excellent, staff are excellent, facilities and breakfast are also excellent. For the cynical reader, no, I do not work for NH nor am I associated with them in any way! Everybody has different requirements and it is rare to find a hotel that you have truly enjoyed. NH Giustiniano is certainly one of them.

The hotel is distinctly average, and as I did not manage to bag a \"bargain\", I was left feeling a little cheated. My room had a suite attached, which rather bizarrely had a cooker and hot rings in one of the cupboards (but no pots, pans, plates etc). As has been mentioned before, there is a balcony, but no chairs or tables. There are no curtains, but instead you have to lower a metal shutter down over your window at night time (the street is quite bright, so you have to close the shutter if you want to get to sleep). The beds are completely rock hard, tricky the first night, but then you get used to it. Breakfast is not much to write home about - rolls, some cheese, fresh fruit if you get there in time - but there is the bonus of champagne. This is a long way from a luxury hotel, really just somewhere to sleep, and at this price, a bit of a disappointment. I was woken up at 10.00am on the 2nd day despite a \"Do not Disturb\" sign that I had placed on the door at 9.00am. The person refused to go away until they could check my mini-bar, even though I had arranged for it to be emptied the day before... Internet is expensive. Good location for Vatican, quiet street, local shops etc, but it is no more than a very basic, no frills, cheaply furnished attempt at a hotel. Certainly not worth the couple of hundred Euros per night that I paid direct through their website. If I had the time to organise it, I think a local B and B would have been substantially better. I would not stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camarillo, California", "Title": "\u201cModern, New Hotel for a Reasonable Rate\u201d", "Author": "scowdrey", "ReviewID": "UR66929871", "Content": "The NH Giustiniano could not have been better for my wife's and my first trip to Rome.

There was a private balcony running the full length of the suite with 3 separate sets of French doors (2 in the living room, 1 in the bedroom). Our room had a stunning view of St. Peter's. The service was very good. The front desk staff all spoke English. Breakfast was also included and was excellent. They even had champagne available each morning. We booked ground transport from the airport through the hotel. It was 50 euros for a private car. This seemed to be a better option than the train to Termini and then a taxi to the hotel, and not much more money. It saved us from having to lug our bags through the busy Termini station after a long flight. We had no complaints at all.

The room & bathroom were a good size & finished to a high standard with all mod cons.The bathroom had a brilliant,powerful rainfall type shower.Tv had lots of european channels & also MTV & BBC World news.

We took the offer, and are so glad we did!! Room: Room was fantastic! Big and spacious, modern and very very clean! One room with couch, Tv, closet space, minibar and desk and coffee table, other room with king size bed, another TV and small balcony. The bed...OMG!!!so amazing!!!! Large bathroom with bathtub and shower in one, modern basin and clean toilet. Nice selection of toiletries in the bathroom incl the usual shower caps and the more upmarkey dental kit and hand sanitiser. The view from our room (room 502) was great: Castle St Angelo right in front, and St peter's basilica on the right! The only thing I could possibly complain about was that the rooms should have had a tiny balcony/terrace in that direction, so that one could enjoy the view of the vatican without having to stick your head out of the window! lol...but its a small complaint, since everything else was perfect! Location: A mere 5 minutes walk to Castle St Angelo, so of course, its 5 minutes to the vatican (in the opposite direction. In fact, Rome is so small and compact, you can walk pretty much everywhere without getting too tired (comfy shoes a must!). The metro lepanto is near (7 minutes walk), but we found it much easier to just walk to Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese and Trevi Fountain. Food: Here again, only a small complaint: the breakfast selection was not that vast. There was plenty to eat, but not that much choise in terms of variety...especially as I dont eat meat! There are pastries(not very good), cakes, assortment of breads and jams...cheese paltter, cold meats, fruit and a tiny selection of hot (scrambled eggs, bacon and suasage)...nothing else, and no selection of type of eggs for example. i only mention the lack of choice because the standard of the hotel is excellent and they could really improve their breakfast buffet to match the standard they have set. I have been to many hotel buffet brekfasts and have seen a much much wider selection. Breakfast staff very friendly though! Best part of trip: The minibar was refilled the second day...and we were charged nothing! There was so much to drink..;we could not even finish it! There is not much to do in the neighbourhood, the hotel bar is virtually empty, as is the restuarant. We spent 30 minutes walking about outside looking for a coffeeshop before we had to settle on room service! But there is a wonderful restaurant in the same block as the hotel called rafs...the pizza is just simply amazing!!! Its a must try!

Its not very cheap but comparing to the prices of the other hotels in Rome its neither very expensive and I can assure you its worth every penny... The most important thing for me is location.

Its situated on a very quiet street and in the summer you can easily sleep with the windows open. It also has high standard air conditioning - if you like that.
