We chose the place as it offered a triple room in three stars for only \u00c2\u00a370 a night. Even having read the reviews here I still felt confident enough in the ratings system to give it a go. Sadly I was wrong. I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewer in suggesting that the 3 star rating is misleading. If it had been two stars then I certainly would have avoided it. The place IS well situated, and our room ('Hastings') did have a reasonable amount of space and a mini fridge. However, the overall decor is shabby, paint is flaking off, there are holes in the plaster, the wallpaper is stained, a thick layer of grime covers anything not directly in the line of sight, and we had bare electrical wires hanging from the roof. The bathroom again was simply dirty; broken tiles were mended with copious trowel slaps of silicon filler, the sinks and plugs were covered with mildew, and the icing on the cake is a handwritten note saying the toilet can't take paper - you either put it in the main room bin or use the main toilet down on the landing. Breakfast is croissants/bread and coffee (no tea when we were there) and the bread was stale each day. We did have a good time in London and made the place our home of sorts for the four days we were there. So I don't mean to rubbish it outright, but anyone thinking like us that this place is a hidden bargain, please think again, it is two stars at the MOST, more likely less than that.

The available staff was very nice and tried to be helpful whenever possible. However, I would not stay here again, mainly because I felt that I was the victim of false advertising. While preparing for this trip, I narrowed the hotel choices down to a handful of very similar hotels. The deciding factor was that this hotel had satellite TV, which I enjoy watching in the evenings after running around all day. Only the hotel doesn't really have satellite TV, or anything other than the basic few channels. When we asked about it, they just smiled and shrugged. Additionally, I asked for a double room with two beds. What we got was one bed and a very old, creaky cot. I didn't expect luxury for the price we were paying, but at least I expected to get what I signed up for. On top of that, the bathroom tile was pretty moldy and dirty, and the breakfast was minimal at best - not worth tramping down the three flights of stairs for.

It was conveniently located, and not the worst accommodation we found in England by far (do NOT stay at the Holmlea Guest House in York), but we were definitely disappointed. The building itself had slid a bit past \"shabby chic\" to settle firmly in the region of just plain shabby. Water from the vintage sink had splashed onto the cheesy formica counter so often, and been allowed to sit there so long, that the countertop was warped and split, and the exposed particle board beneath it had begun to erode, leaving a small pile of sawdust near the toilet. Water damage must once have been a priority, however, for a faded sign bolted to the wall exhorted guests not to let water from the shower sit on the floor tiles. This helpful hint seemed a bit anachronistic, as the tiles had long ago been covered over by a musty and matted deep brown carpet. The towels, of several fashionably coordinated shades of no-longer-white, hung from a metal bar spotted with green mildew, and notably absent from the bath linens was a wash-cloth, something the many guide books we had read while preparing for our journey had somehow failed to advise us to pack. On the walls of the shower, black mold had succeeded in conquering the grout between the tiles and was beginning to expand its empire onto the water-spotted porcelain itself. The bed, which had been advertised as queen sized, was some weird European size comparable, at best, to a double. The breakfasts, self-serve, were meager by any standard. The location is great, near a tube station, a tourist office, and a stop for the double decker tour buses.
