{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't expect any more than the basics! My friend and I stayed here for three nights on a sightseeing visit. The hotel is basic, and the rate is a little more than was worth it. However, having said that, the room was spotlessly clean, beds were comfortable, fully air-conditioned and heated. TV channels as expected - CNN and the likes. We had a balcony overlooking the street below which was nice.A one minute walk from the Rambla, right in the centre - just behind the Lyceum Theatre - the street the hotel sits on is a little ropey - pickpockets at work! We could see them doing their business from the balcony! Heading up the street any further past the hotel is a little scary.On night two, in the early hours - around 2AM there was a rave going on with loud music, swearing, screaming and shouting - possibly Pete Doherty and Amy Winehouse had checked in? There was no number to call down to reception and we were a little too frightened to leave the room!Didn't use the restaurant - didn't look like anyone else was either although the hotel seemed very quiet.All in all, a reasonable hotel, centrally located but don't expect any service or anything more than the basics!", "Date": "Nov 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR678430929", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "trendytraveller112"}, {"Content": "Viva Espanya Basic? Basically awful! Our welcome pack in room 215 was a poo in the toilet. The toilet that flushed into the dwarf sized bath. The bedspreads are laundered bi-annually. The tele did not work. The wardrobe was covered in lovely graffiti and notches similar to the ones found in prison cells.", "Date": "Nov 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR108827842", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Pretzel-Fritzl"}, {"Content": "Very good For a 2* hotel, it was very correct and good. Service at the reception is very helpful - there is a lobby where you can rest or wait too. Rooms aren't exceptional but quality/price report, its very correct. Everything was very clean and the breakfast is also very good, for a quite reasonable price. Location is excellent. I would return and recommend it.", "Date": "Sep 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR351711810", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "karenkupfer"}, {"Content": "Ottimo   showReview(22203675, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR531175890", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "EleToscana"}, {"Content": "Das Espanya ist einfach nur unhygienisch!   showReview(21895456, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR325498101", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Dominik1988"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d652536-r22297802-Hotel_Espanya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "652536", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
