{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a great little place! I read about this place in Lonely Planet and had it on my list of places to try for several years.Finally made it in 2007 and loved it.A great location,excellent food,cheap beer,very clean bungalows,and very helpful staff. I'm going back to Bali this year and will be staying at Amarta again for sure.If you are looking for a special place to chill out away from the hustle and bustle this should suit you!", "Date": "Feb 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR190937331", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chintarama"}, {"Content": "Great simple hideaway cottages       the grounds", "Date": "Mar 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR392158645", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BrigidE"}, {"Content": "Top Preis/Leistung       Ein Bungalow", "Date": "Sep 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR969072541", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "chregi2"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312684-d646195-r13541653-Amarta_Beach_Inn_Bungalows-Candidasa_Bali.html", "HotelID": "646195", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
