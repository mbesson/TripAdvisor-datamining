LOCATION: The Madera is a 3 minute walk to the Jordan MTR station, just off Nathan Rd, and within easy access to shopping and fantastic restaurants. TYPE OF ROOM: We booked a Deluxe Double (level 9-15) via the Iprefer program and hotel website. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Grand Deluxe room on the 18th floor. The room was very modern, compact, with everything you needed, and a great use of space. The furnishings were new with bright colour schemes, matching artwork and d\u00e9cor. The iphone docking station was a nice touch. All of the light switches were touch switches, which was very stylish. There was a free (once off) mini bar in the room, something I haven\u2019t experienced anywhere else. Our room was quiet, we didn\u2019t hear a sound at night. Room price included a light breakfast of a coffee/tea and a pastry at the hotel caf\u00e9. BATHROOM/SHOWER: The bathroom was terrific. The bath was a jet bath (like a spa), with shower over head. The shower pressure was fantastic. Our bathroom had one hand basin, however I believe other types of rooms have 2 hand basins. Bathroom amenities were by Crabtree and Evelyn. There were even electronic scales in the bathroom, just in case you want to see how much weight you\u2019ve put on from all of the delicious Hong Kong food. CLEANLINESS: The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean. CLOSET SPACE: There was a closet with a safe inside, and a small area to store your bags. TV/INTERNET: There was a TV in the room with a good selection of channels, including quite a few English channels. Wi-Fi was provided throughout the hotel. SERVICE: From booking the hotel through to checking out all of the staff we dealt with were friendly, professional and very helpful. We were arriving around 8pm, and emailed the hotel prior to arrival to ask if they knew of a restaurant nearby to have roast goose. When we arrived the hotel had kindly booked a restaurant for us, and ordered \u00bc of a goose. Upon check out the hotel staff offered to assist us with ordering a Taxi or getting to the airport. The staff also directed us to their onsite gallery to have a look. It\u2019s quite a credit to the hotel that they have put this space together, which takes you through the history of Hong Kong. OVERALL: For the location and price of this hotel, I doubt you\u2019d find better in Hong Kong. It\u2019s a hidden gem, and one that won\u2019t stay hidden for much longer. Enjoy it while its still new.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with reasonable cheap price\u201d", "Author": "devilton", "ReviewID": "UR138785414", "Content": "Saw online that it was a very new and clean hotel yet going for S$180+, so booked it for my trip. The lobby is very modern and conceige staff are good enough for my expectation. When entered the room, was very surprised that it was very beautiful and neat. Also that the drinks and snacks are all free too but only for that one time, no refill, which is not very fair for those who stayed many nights like me but then again, almost all other hotels charge for those things. Most importantly, they have free wifi throughout without any limitation to the number of user. The bed is very comfortable with nice pillows. Full wall window, perfect if with nice view. Haha. The bathtub comes with jacuzzi which my daughter, wife and I enjoyed a lot. My room even has a extra small room acting as a study room and wardrobe but not for my friend's room. It seems that it's slightly different from room to room. They have safe for valuable too. I left coins for their housekeeping meant as tips and it was untouched till the last day, very trustworthy keepers. This hotel has a very fun part, they have a room that keeps lots of vintage stuff, really enjoyed ourselves in there taking photos and fooling around. :) Please spend some time at the top floor lounge if you have the time, it is a very nice place to chill but they close at 11pm. Saw that they have car racing room but didn't get to try that, maybe next time. Last but not least, the hotel is very near to the Jordan MTR and 10 mins walk to reach Tsim Sha Tsui. There are many convenient shops to buy grocery and daily products, many good eateries too. Seriously, as long as the price doesn't go up by too much, I would stick to this hotel whenever I visit HK or an even better deal hotel comes along.

The staff were always friendly and helpful. Amenities were quite comically modern.. interesting lighting arrangements, automatic music (unfortunately we were woken up by this on our first night as it seems to have been accidentally programmed to switch on at 7am - an explanation at check-in about how to use it would have been nice), and an iphone/ipod stereo (sorry not sure exactly what it was but we don't have any i-toys so it didn't apply to us ;) The room was a strange set-up: the office desk/chair was in a separate and very tiny room together with the closet and fridge. I presume this is to try to make the best use of the extremely limited space (it's not big by any account but I'm guessing it might be standard or even spacious for HK). The worst thing was the shower, which for some reason pointed in a funny direction and got everything a bit wet... it also tended to form a bath as you showered, not draining very quickly... this could have been a fault with our room though.

No problem with taxi drivers. No probelms getting taxis, buses, mini-buses. A 5 minute walk from exit B1 Jordan MTR. Hotel Lobby & Design: Reception is pretty small but nicely decorated, there is a smallish gallery on the ground floor with a touch of old Hong Kong, great for pictures. Nice boutique feel, overall. Vicinity: There's a traditional HK teahouse (Victory Restuarant) opposite the hotel that serves great breakfast/lunch at affordable prices. Love the luncheon meat with egg rice... Plenty of eating joints and there are a few convenience stores, medical halls, pharmacies littering the area so everything is pretty convenient. Use the underpass at Saigon Street (parallel to Cheung Lok Street) to get to more good food stops and Temple Street Night Market just across the road. Service: Personally, I felt hotel service was above average. Everyone was really helpful and nice, advising on the weather conditions and passing us umbrellas :) Especially the door man / concierge guys. Housekeeping was tip-top. They were always greeting us and smiling. Rooms: Nicely decorated in contemporary style and everything is clean and new. They provide full range of toiletries and an all-you-can help yourself mini-bar (chips, coke, beer, water) that gets replenished daily. Bed and pillows were very comfortable. For the price you're paying the room size is decent, compared to other hotels in the Mongkok/Nathan Road area. By the way, layout and size of superior and deluxe rooms are exactly the same, except the deluxe rooms are situated on higher floors.... Cons (for us): The hotel is totally non-smoking and they do not serve breakfast (or actually they do on Level 3 at the Cafe but mainly pastry and stuff) and there was no room service for our late night supper but then again, there are plenty of food joints a stone's throw away. My overall take is that for the price we paid we got a good deal, we've stayed at other hotels in the area and paid more for less. Even local friends who visited us here shared the same view. Well, catch it while it's new as I think it's only a matter of time before they increase their prices....

My mom and I stayed in a twin room for 2 nights. The room size is decent, compared to other hotels I've stayed in HK. The bathroom is clean and modern, and the shower's water pressure was fantastic! (I think these rooms would be good for couples or close family members, because you can still see what's going on in the bathroom behind the translucent glass walls.) The wifi was fast and stable, and there are plenty of electrical outlets around the room to plug stuff into. Being on Nathan Rd and less than 5mins away from the Jordan station was also very convenient. I thought the service was decent. The staff at the counter were always nice and greeted me when I entered/exited the hotel. I also had some large packages to wrap and they didn't really have the right tools to help me with that, but they did recommend where nearby I could go get some, while they stowed my stuff. There's no hotel breakfast, but it's not a huge deal for me, since it's HK and there's food everywhere. The air ducts (or plumbing from another room?) did make some periodic strange noises, but overall, everything else about the hotel made up for it. There's a very cute hotel cafe on the 3rd floor which was great for just hanging out, waiting for visitors. And a neat museum on the base floor to wander around in. The best part about the hotel was the rate. It was cheaper than a couple other places I've stayed at (mainly ones that keep popping up on internet hotel searches for this price range and star grade), and the newness and MTR location are key.

Madera is definitely the best in its category (for now). First: Its new. Just had its official opening in late march. Everything in the hotel, from the lobby to the lifts to corridors to the rooms smells fresh. Design is chic and stylish. Second: The rooms. We (couple) stayed in a standard room. Room size is acceptable. Cause in hk, we dont expect a really spacious room, esp for the price we pay. In fact, it was far better than we expected. beside the common sleeping area, there is another corner where u find a wardrobe, safe deposit box and a mini-bar (YES! everything is complimentary and is replenished every single day!) Lightings r adjustable according to your 'mood'. Bathroom comes with a jaccuzi bathtub which is a plus for us. Third: The staff. Not always very friendly but definitely very helpful. Never fail to clear our doubts and enquiries. Makes us feel like home. Fourth: The location. As mentioned by the other reviewers, its conveniently located 5mins from the JORDAN MTR station (Exit B1 or B2). Besides that, just opposite the hotel is a restuarant/ shop selling nice affordable red and white wines. Slightly to the right is Plaza 18 (18\u5e7f\u573a). At the 1st floor of this plaza is a chinese restuarant (\u65b0\u6597\u8bb0), who serves very nice authentic HK/ chinese cruisine (e.g. roasted goose). Its worth a try if u wana splurge and indulge alittle. For those who wana experience hk nightlife and is too lazy to go all the way to Lan Guai Fwong (\u5170\u6842\u574a), there is a Club 18 on the 14th floor (of Plaza 18). Its not a bad place to people watch. Try going after 10pm. thats when the crowd and pretty people starts arriving. Overall, Madera is definitely worth staying. Definitely worth every single dollar.
