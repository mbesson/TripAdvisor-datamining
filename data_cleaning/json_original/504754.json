The tube station nearest the hotel, 2 min walk around the corner, is Lancaster Gate which is on the central line. From here you can get anywhere, changing at Oxford Cirus will get you on to the circle line linking to all the attractions of London. The hotel was quiet at night, our room was to the side of the hotel, I wasnt woken up at all dont let the fact that there is a pub nearby put you off as they dont allow people to drink outside after about 10pm and its a fairly quiet local kind of pub not a 'boom boom' sort of place. The beds were ok, no worse than my own bed! If you just want a nice base in a quiet and safe location then Elysee should suit you fine.

Bathroom also small, but clean and acceptable. The only problem was very low water pressure, so it was very hard to take shower, washing long hair was almost impossible. Also satelite TV offered very low number of chanels, but this is triviality. Walls are very thin, so you can hear TV and voices from the next room. There was a safe box which we found useful. Breakfast served in the ground floor was simple - not continental in my eyes, but you could eat enough. They offered baked beans, mashed eggs, hard boiled eggs, toasts, jams, butter, cheese, 3 types of cereals with milk and some canned fruits. Breakfast was served from 7:30 till 9:30, but some of the guest came late at 9:30 and the staff had no problem with that. Staff was very nice and helpful, providing coffee and tea. We were missing some saussages or ham coz the breakfast became quite monotonous every day. For late coming it was sometimes difficult to find cheese or juice - they were run out.

The staff are polite and helpful. The hotel is well-kept, bearing in mind the age of the building. The location was ideal for our purposes, situated in a quiet street but with useful shops and businesses nearby and within easy walking distance to 3 tube stations - Lancaster Gate, Queensway and Paddington. All in all, this is a quirky little place and is excellent value for money considering what you'd pay in one of the \"smart\" hotels in the area.

The walls were very thin so we could hear people in adjacent rooms having a conversation. Also, due to their poor quality it was difficult to completely close our windows meaning that we could hear all the noise from the street below. The breakfast left a lot to be desired. Firstly, the breakfast room was located in the basement of the hotel and was extremely cramped and damp smelling. There was an extremely poor selection of food on offer, a self service toast machine which only seemed to toast the bread on one side, youghurts which were left on a table and had turned warm, eggs and beans and cereal in tube dispensers that looked like it had been there for ages. It would actually better to advertise the hotel as room only. Also found the staff quite unhelpful, especially when asking for a taxi to take us to the station with our small suitcases.

Unfortunately the friendliness of the staff was limited to the two guys working on day shift. Everything else after the reception was..more or less a disappointment. The room was absolutely the tiniest HOTEL room I have ever seen! It wasn't much bigger than a broom closet! If I placed my luggage on the floor, I couldn't open the door and had to jump over it to get to the bath\"room\". Every time I wanted out, I had to close my luggage and place it next to the bed or in front of the toilet seat. There was not even a sliding door between the bath and the room itself, so all the steam, smells, everything spread to the room. The bath was refurbished, luckily, but since the shower nozzle could not be adjusted, you couldn't take a shower without getting your hair wet. The shower booth was so tiny that if you moved or turned, you touched the walls immediately! If you left the door open, the whole place got wet. There was no place to hang your towel or place your clothes or even toiletries. There wasn't even a proper coat rack to hang your longer coat or any longer pieces of clothing. Well, there were two hangers, so... There was no extra seating in the room, no chair, nothing, but on the other hand, there wouldn't have been room either... The only place to put your toiletries or shopping or anything was by the headboard and the shelf was so narrow! There was a tea kettle, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of drinking anything coming out of it. Also all the walls were stained and the carpeting so worn. On the night of my arrival, I woke to the freezing temperature in the room. The radiator was not working, neither could I turn on the heat pump on the wall. When I complained about it, it took hours before anyone could come and see either of the appliances. There was no extra blanket either. In the morning I realised why it had been so darn cold - the window was BROKEN behing the curtains!! There had been some sticky tape over the cracks, but they'd dried and dropped to the sill ages ago. Later on it was revealed that there was something wrong with the plugs in the room - how safe was I! The breakfast was lousy. Cereal, toast, canned fruits (which I saw no one touching), beans and scrambled/boiled eggs. You only got eggs and beans if you happened to go to breakfast early enough. How on earth can a hotel run out of breakfast!?! No apologies were made. They are advertising for their pub, but at least I couldn't find one. Perhaps it was the door that was closed next to the brekkie room? If you're accustomed to the 13.00 or 14.00 late check outs, don't dream of such in this place! It's 11.00 in best case and getting even that depends on who you're asking.

When I asked about the bar being closed, I was told that the barman was sick which was obviously not the reason for all the cleaning material etc. stored in the bar. In the middle of the second night we were awoken by a dreadful noise and discovered we were being flooded from the room above - the bathroom was completely deluged, water was dripping out of the ceiling lights and had saturated the carpet. We called reception and spent a very exhausting night getting rearranged. We had to very, very firmly INSIST on a move as the assistant felt we could just stay in this room. I had to point out the danger involved (electricity) and insist that the manager be contacted. We were reluctantly given a different room and began to move all our stuff to it but the young man on duty told us to leave our belongings as we would return to this room the next day. I could not imagine how but assumed the hotel had some way of getting things dried up.We took what we needed for the night and moved but got very little sleep. The next morning we were informed at very short notice (we received a call from reception while we were still in bed) that we were indeed moving again and were told to pack up and also get our things from the first room to move to a third room. As a result we missed a walk we had booked. In the ensuing chaos our coats went missing for a day and night (September in London!) and an expensive sports spectacle case went missing completely. We had to haul our heavy cases down several flights of stairs without help on leaving. We were not offered an apology by the management never mind any form of compensation - the manager did not even show up after the incident although we asked to speak to him. The receptionists appeared to be very puzzled that we wanted to speak to the manager, could not remember all the upheaval with the flooding and when reminded simply shrugged their shoulders.

In truth, it should have been a double without the added single bed. Protests had us moved to a quad room - no larger really but a spare bed to park the bags.

Dirty blankets (replaced the next day.) Only one towel each and no bath mat. Refurbished interior but tacky around the edges. Free internet only accessible in the foyer on your laptop - at painfully slow speeds. (Very expensive broadband available.)
