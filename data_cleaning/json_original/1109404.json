The food for our conference = not so great, but I assume most folks won't be eating at the hotel. EVERYTHING is nearby this place by the way: Taksim Square, Istiklal street, bars, restaurants, the Metro, the Fenicular (sp?), etc. I should note that I did not handle the payment/$$$ - so I have no idea what they were like in this capacity (as others have complained about this).", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cthey are like thief!!!\u201d", "Author": "aliho154943", "ReviewID": "UR126451842", "Content": "dear sir after challenging a lot finally I arrived to the hotel and I found that they are very impolite and they act like a thief!! because of hotel problem with my credit card I should pay all of money at the beginning and despite of my booking reservation they asked me 880$!!! when I told them I should pay 824$ and they found that I knew the price I gave them totally amount!!!!826$! the sauna, Turkish bath and even if Jacuzzi is not free and we should pay money to use them !!!

However, this is also the only positive to be said about the Golden Park Hotel. The staff is rude and do not offer any service. In addition, the enter occupied rooms at all times of the day, including in the middle of the night when hotel guests are sleeping, supposedly to add to the mini bar, change towels, etc. without having been requested by the guest. The breakfast buffet is primarily sweets, which makes it difficult for anyone not eating sweets for breakfast to find something. The rooms are big, but the interior is bashed and not well maintained and the air condition is not functioning. My room was 40 degrees Celsius despite that I turned the air condition to lowest possible temperature. Upon request for help from the reception, I just got an angry answer that they cannot do anything, and that I should open the window. In addition, the wall are very thin, so if you are a light sleeper, you will hear when all the party people are returning from the nightlife throughout the night. Finally, if you have Turkish friends of business partners, do not invite them to your room. The front desk will start to call you after 5 minutes upon arrival that they should leave or you will be expelled from the hotel.

We had a triple room, which has en suite,air-con, TV minibar (highly priced - not surprising really). Hotel has a free pool and pay for services (sauna, Turkish bath, massages etc). Rooms have a button to request do not disturb or to clean the room rather than a hanger on the door - just remember to press it if you want your room cleaned.
