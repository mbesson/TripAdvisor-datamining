Our checked bags didn't show up and the front desk staff hounded the airline and the baggage handling office with phone calls every day, and gave us progress report when we came back in the evening.

Having received overpriced recommendations for other hotels in and around the city, I decided to do some research of my own, set a budget and then checked the reviews for the hotels I could afford. I stumbled across the Re Di Roma and it seemed too good to be true, but I decided to take a chance and went for it and i'm so glad we did! There is a train that goes directly to the Leonardo Da Vinci airport and for \u20ac8 you can get to the hotel very easily. You have the option of taking the train to the Termini, then get on the metro to the Re Di Roma stop which is literally at the end of the street or alternatively, get off at Tuscolana and it's a short walk to the hotel. The hotel itself is very boutique-like, stylish and modern, it really is quite pleasant and quite a contrast to the rustic, historic city of Rome. We checked in and got shown to our room which was on the 1st floor. The room wasn't huge but it was big enough for us, there's plenty of storage space, a mini fridge, complimentary toiletries in the bathroom and the safe is free to use. Breakfast is provided on a morning consisting of fruit, yoghurt, bread, meats, cheese, pastries and cereal as well as tea, coffee and juice. Rooms are equipped with sky television but most of the channels are pre-set to Italian, however, if the information box has a language option, you can change it to English and still manage to watch things! The road outside the hotel is fairly busy so if you go to sleep at night I wouldn't advise opening the window if you're a light sleeper but the rooms have air conditioning to help with this! There is a box for each room behind the reception desk so you can leave your room key there if you don't feel like carrying it round everyday and the staff are really helpful.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cexcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "vickie h", "ReviewID": "UR127032925", "Content": "We stayed for three nights at this hotel and had a very pleasant stay. The hotel is very modern and well furnished, our room was basic but very clean and provided everything we needed. The only negative we can think of is there are no English channels included on the TV and the walls of the room must be quite thin as you could hear the people next door, however it was not really an annoyance at any point. Fresh towels were provided daily and the breakfast was a basic continental but perfectly adequate. The staff were exceptionally helpful and were more than happy to offer advice about navigating around the city. The hotel is about a 2 min walk to the metro which we used regularly as it is about a 20 min walk to the Colosseum and about 30-40 min walk to the city center. If you do walk in to the city look out for the san giovanni basillica en route...its a magnificent church to wander around! We bought a three day ticket from the tobacconist shop opposite the hotel which gave us complete access to all the buses, trains and trams whilst we were there. We also made use of the number 87 bus which runs from a road nearby (about a 10min walk from the hotel) and took us close to campo de fuiri (near piaza navona) in the center of the city past the Colosseum. They do not run as regularly as the metro however and can be busy so watch out for pick pockets! The hotel provides a map of the city which we used consistently throughout our trip and can also arrange tours etc.They can also arrange transfers to the airport, however we got the train direct from fumicino to tuscolana station which was about a 10 min walk from the hotel and had no problems at all. I would avoid getting the fast train to the termini and changing there to get the metro to the re di roma stop as it is incredibly busy and you have to negotiate a lot of escalators! If you get the direct train aim for the corridor seating along the train rather than the seats of 4 as its easier to keep your luggage with you without getting in the way! It costs 8 euros each way for the train and you cant use the travel card for the Rome transport on these trains.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cjust what you need in a hotel\u201d", "Author": "apbp2009", "ReviewID": "UR126751030", "Content": "Stayed hear for three night.

Breakfast, was just perfect. We had croissants, and other types of breaks. Butter, jelly. Cereal, milk, coffee, fruits, juice, cheese, jams, etc. We could eat as much as we wanted and even take a banana or apple for a mid-day snack. Our room had a mini fridge, and TV with cable as well as internet connection. The staff, was just wonderful. They tried to help us with every request, both at the breakfast area as well as the lobby area. They recommended us the best place to have pizza, and gelato. Funny cause we looked on goo.gle the #1 gelato place in Rome and we went there, and on our last day in Rome took the staff advice and visited the one on Re Di Roma Piazza, which was way better than the one recommended by goo.gle. Walking around Re Di Roma was wonderful, and having such a great hotel to come back every night made our stay even better. FYI, just keep in mind that the hotel price does not include a 2 euro charge per person per day, something with the city charges, so keep some cash in your pockets as you will need to pay this amount before you leave the hotel.

We really enjoyed the room - really beautiful inside, very spacious, modern, everything was very clean and user-friendly (ie TV, air). The view from the windows - less beautiful. But it's a quiet area and it was good enough for who it was for! Loved that we had a patio with chairs and a table, it was perfect for sitting out OR drying the clothes we washed in our bathroom. The internet worked great there for our laptop and iPod touch. The breakfast was ok - nothing totally memorable but fine. While we were there, the metro wasn't working - that being said, the walk was too long to get to where we needed to go most of the time. It was definitely farther from most places than I expected. If the metro had been working, it would have been perfect though, because the distance meant it was a quiet area. There was a day where we wanted to stay in and get some laundry done and try to get in touch with our families, and we actually were asked to leave since we hadn't left by 11, but this was understandable because they wanted to clean our room - the only problem was that I had asked how long they expected it would take to clean the room, we were told about 30 or 45 minutes, and 45 minutes later I walked upstairs and there were like 3 people in our room just standing around. That was strange at the time, it threw me off a little, but looking back I think one was a manager talking to the cleaning people. Normal precautions about keeping your valuable stuff in your bags would suffice there. The showers drain very slowly - when asked if they could come clean it, the front desk staff explained that the way the showers are is different than other places and the slow draining is a result because they are trying to avoid having any weird smells enter the bathroom? It was confusing but they tried their best to explain it (even drew a picture). We didn't see this any other place we stayed at in Italy. We basically just had to turn the water off while we were soaping up, turn it back on when we were rinsing. As long as you're ok taking the metro or walking a pretty good distance to the main spots in Roma, this is a great place to stay for the value.

The rooms are very neatly maintained, and many of them come with a pretty decent-sized terrace (mine had a rooftop terrace, which was lovely). Bathrooms are spacious and very clean. Daily cleaning service is impeccable. Sleep quality is pretty good as the hotel is located at the end of a rather quite street. The location isn't the best in Roma, but then it is only about three minute walk away from Line A's re di Roma station. As there aren't many exceptional restaurants nearby, you may want to dine somewhere else and come back while it is not too late. There is a brilliant tiramisu place called Bar Pompi near the re di Roma circle, however. The rooms come with continental breakfast, which isn't the fanciest in the world but still offers pretty much everything you would expect in a satisfying morning meal. Wifi connection is fairly strong, but I don't know if they offer wired connection. The staff are quite professional and friendly. Let me tell you how dedicated they are. I had to leave very early in the morning (one of those Ryanair flights at ungodly hours), but the concierge offered to prepare a breakfast just for me at 4am. 4am!

There are also a couple of supermarkets where you can get water and snacks at reasonable prices. The hotel offers free breakfast which consists of croissants, bread, spreads, nutella, fruits, ham, cheese, cereals, yogurt and juices from 7 to 10 am. They offer free wi-fi in their bedrooms. The bedroom is spacious and very comfortable. Bed and pillows are soft enough for a great night sleep. Since there is no rug but hardwood floor, they give you complementary slippers. We went in November and their ac was set to heater, but the room had a very nice cool temperature so we didn't need to use it or open the window. The few minutes we did open the window the street was quiet. The room even had a balcony which we didnt have time to enjoy. The decoration is modern and beautiful. The service is excellent. Eleonora helped us with many things and questions, including to find an excellent restaurant a few blocks away. They even held a bag for us for a few days that we went to Florence. When going to the hotel, keep in mind that it doesn't have a big sign to indicate where it is. The name of the hotel is at the door.

There were no tea/coffee making facilities but there was a minibar. Rooms were serviced daily to a good standard (we returned one day to find the pyjamas which had been inadvertantly left out were folded very neatly on the bed). Both the hotel & the area were quiet. We paid \u00a3625 for five nights which is very reasonable for Rome & included breakfast which was a bit limited but perfectly OK. The hotel also has a 24hr bar with reasonable prices. Rome is a pretty spectacular city but there are a lot of cobbles & steps etc so I recommend comfortable shoes! It was also very hot & humid while were were there but there are small drinking fountains all over the place so buy a bottle of water & then top up from a fountain - the water is good, cool & of course free. Do get yourself travel passes. They're cheap (16\u20ac for a 7 day one) & are valid for metro, tram & bus.

Rome is too big to stay near every tourist thing, if your goal is to stay in the heart of Rome you're going to have to choose a \"heart\" and still do public transport. The Re Di Roma Hotel is not in the heart of Rome but will get you there quickly because of its proximity to the metro. The reason this hotel is most excellent is because it's not in a tourist area! It was by far our favorite hotel during a 3 week trip around Italy. Ask the hotel for restaurant recommendations. Everywhere they sent us was the best food we had in our travels. They were little neighborhood restaurants run by families that couldn't do enough to please us. The folks at these restaurants didn't speak English but we communicated just fine. The prices were so much more reasonable than any of the restaurants we went to near the tourist spots. Also, the shops and bars around the hotel: people don't speak English but can't do enough to help you. It's a neighborhood where the up and comers live so it's safe and there's no riff raff. The staff in the hotel can't help you enough. One night we were going out and the front desk clerk said it looked like rain and gave me an umbrella to borrow. The negatives. You're not going to find a big American breakfast anywhere in Italy that I know of but the continental fair they offer will get you to lunch. So the only negative that's really worthy of mention is the thin ceilings/floors. First of all, don't be a dummy like us. The hallway noise is also an issue but they've provided a second door that blocks it out if you're smart enough to close it (I plead jet lag dumbness-we figured it out our last night). As for the other noise issues, they really weren't a problem. It's not a riff raff kind of hotel. It was international travelers and business men and there wasn't a loud tv or loud talking problem. Just a few footsteps till whoever removed their shoes, a door closing, some water running. I travel with earplugs and didn't have to use them. Unless you are highly sensitive the noise problem will not effect you. Pompi. Don't miss it. It's a dessert restaurant around the corner from the Re Di Roma Hotel. It's closed on Monday and open till 1:30 am other nights. Go there your first night in Rome because you'll want the option of going there every night. I don't like tiramisu but I loved this restaurants'. ps. They have several tiramisu flavors: traditional, strawberry (excellent), pistachio and hazelnut plus lots of other desserts. Note: the Metro is having nighttime construction right now so it closes at 9:30 pm (except Sat night). At every A line metro stop you'll find a bus stop for the M1 or M2 buses. These buses follow the A line metro route so catch one of them to get back to the hotel. Don't forget to purchase your bus ticket in the metro station (same ticket as for the metro) because there isn't one at the bus stop and the bus driver doesn't sell tickets.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat Choice\u201d", "Author": "Transporter_11", "ReviewID": "UR113876144", "Content": "Great location, convient to underground, rome and other attractions.

Unfortunatly there aren't many restuarants within walking distance of the hotel, but this wasnt a problem for us as we just ate in the area we had visited that day, and made our way home in the evening, usually walk to coloseum and get a taxi from there for a fairly reasonable price. Not many taxi's have heard of the hotel, but all know the square re di roma, which is easy enough to remember considering hotel is of same name, once you get to 'piazza re di roma' you will immediately recognise where you are and be able to take the 3minute walk along the road to the hotel. Before you leave for your trip, i would strongly advise going on the hotel re di roma web site where they give you perfect directions to the hotel using the metro system which could save you some money, think we paid about 14euro each to travel from airport to hotel. Room - No complaints what so ever about the room, was a brilliant size, clean. with a bath and shower in the bathroom and also toiletries shampoo/conditioner/shower gel/hairdrier. therefore dont need to take your own if on tight baggage limit with airline.rooms are cleaned each day and toiletries replaced if required so no worries there. Breakfast - Breakfast is everything you need to set you up for a day sight seeing. composed of, bread rolls, coissants, ham, salami, cheese, fresh fruit, yougurt, selection of jams and spreads on each table, fresh juice, tea and coffee readily available also. Overall i believe re di roma is a perfect base for a sight seeing trip to rome, transport to all major attractions on your door step, clean tidy rooms, which house keeping attend to each day, staff extremely pleasant greeting you each time you enter and leave the hotel. and for the price we paid it offers great value for money and everything you could want/need from a hotel.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFabulous, clean & comfortable..\u201d", "Author": "melodyrose34", "ReviewID": "UR110887767", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights at Re di Roma - and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

How unjustified! The hotel is spotlessly clean, usual bathroom provisions, programmable safe in the room and no charge to use it. City Tax payable at 2 euro per day per person at the end of your stay (this applies to all hotels in Rome). Yes there is some graffiti on walls around the hotel but non on the hotel itself as the staff make every effort to keep it that way. All staff very helpful indeed.Breakfast continental good choice of croissant, bread meat and cheese, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, tea (English and fruit) coffee etc. Small store across the road for essentials. Metro is 200yds (1 euro - use within 75 minutes) and runs literally every 2 mins. Colosseum is 25 minutes walk if you'd rather take the scenic route. We felt very safe returning to the hotel even after dark. One evening we took Pizza purchased from a near by cafe back to our room and ate this on the balcony with a lovely bottle of Chianti as we were a little weary following an early start! Perfect! We would certainly recommend this hotel as an ideal base from which to explore and experience Rome as it is just far enough away from the noise and hustle of the centre but close enough to feel instantly part of it. On our last day the hotel kept our luggage safe for us and booked a taxi for our return to the airport as we had an evening flight. Taking into account the cost of this hotel compared with more centrally located hotels (which cost nearly double) there is no contest.

Our flight arrived very early in the morning so we got to the hotel at 9 am. Although it was much too early for check-in, the reception staff said that it was okay and checked immediately if our room was ready. Because we were staying for a longer amount of time, they had a specific room for us, so it wasn't quite ready yet. However, the staff asked us to enjoy the buffet breakfast in the meantime, which was great! She was very accommodating! When our room was ready, the reception staff took us to our room and showed us around so that we were aware of how everything worked. Our room was great! It was a lot more spacious than what I had expected. Everything was very clean as well. We had a corner room (307) and we had a great wrap-around balcony! Our bathroom also had a tub, which was nice. Our room was also always constantly cleaned exceptionally well on a daily basis! In fact, we were shocked at how much attention the cleaning staff paid to cleaning the rooms and bathrooms... they never missed a spot! The reception staff was AMAZING!! At night, we liked to have hot water and the reception staff was always very courteous and got us hot water. One night the reception staff was busy with guests checking in so she actually came upstairs to our room with the hot water when she was done checking them in! We also left our voltage converter at home and the staff lent us one to use all week! On top of all of that, they booked us on our tours and airport transfer service -- never a disappointment. When we wanted recommendations for places to eat around the area, the staff even printed out a map and directions for us to follow. We have never experienced such courteous staff! They definitely made our stay top-notch! Although the hotel is not a walk away from all of the sites to see in Rome, it was only a block away from the Metro station (Re Di Roma stop). It took 2 minutes to walk to and from the station, and from there you could get off at any stop that allowed you to see everything! Also 2 minutes away was Piazza Re Di Roma where there were shops, a grocery store (great for us because we bought snacks - chips, chocolate, gelato, water - for great prices), and several pizzerias. We went to Pizza Re Di Roma almost daily because the pizza was delicious, the staff was friendly, and they had these deep-fried battered potatoes that sound unhealthy, but were excellent! The buffet breakfast was good as well. They usually had toast, croissants, fruit, yogurt, cheese, deli meats, and cereal. They had an assortment of teas, which was fantastic as well. And, they constantly refilled the food, even past 10 am! The walls in the hotel are a little thin, but we didn't really mind it. It really wasn't an issue for us during our stay. Besides, after full days of roaming around Rome, we were usually too tired and slept wonderfully anyway. If this is something you'd be concerned with, I don't think it should stop you from staying here; I'd just bring ear plugs (if you'd even need them). The decor of the hotel was nice. It's a modern-looking hotel, very simplistic, which we liked. The safe in the room was also great to have. We had such a great stay at Hotel Re Di Roma and would definitely stay there again!

The hotel has been recently refurbished and has the feel of a boutique hotel. Our room exceeded expectations - the bedroom and bathroom were both spacious and very clean. There were hardwood floors in the rooms, an enormous bed (two twins pushed together - which is very common in Italy), wardrobe, small desk, window seat and TV with Sky box. We were also fortunate enough to have a room at the end of the hall which included a large balcony with table and chairs. We both slept very well and, thanks to double doors in the entrance of our room and double-glazed windows, didn't hear any noise from the street, neighbours or other rooms. The shower was hot and powerful, and for those of you who like your bathrooms Continental-style, there was also a bidet. Breakfast is included at the hotel. It was a decent, buffet-style affair served until 10am (great for those who want a little extra sleep). It included meat cold cuts and cheese, rolls, croissants, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, fruit juices, tea and coffee. It was just enough to kick start the day. We found all the hotel staff to be incredibly helpful and kind. They recommended a nearby restaurant for dinner one night (La Foglietta) which was excellent, and happily answered all our questions about getting around Rome. The only slight downside of Hotel Re di Roma is its location. We loved it and managed to plan our days around it so that we also started and/or ended near a Metro station for easy access to the hotel (which is a two-minute walk from Re di Roma Metro station). However, for those who want to be in the city centre and in the thick of it, this is not the place for you. It's more of a quiet oasis away from the hordes of tourists in the centre. We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Re di Roma and would very highly recommend it to anyone visiting Rome.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "CKKUPSTYLES", "ReviewID": "UR84395376", "Content": "Rome was our very first stop for me and my husband's 2 month Europe Honeymoon and this was a great hotel to quick start the honeymoon.

The windows are sound proofed and we did not hear any noise from outside.

There is a coffee machine but you can also ask the waiting staff to get a fresh coffee for you. The breakfast room is small for the size of the hotel so be prepared to share a table with fellow travellers. The desk staff were very helpful and knowledgeable with regards to attractions and transport. Nothing seemed to be too difficult - they are definately there to help. Now, this place isn't too good to be true as there is one downfall and that is that the walls are quite thin in the rooms. We could hear conversations of people in the next room as clear as day and although they weren't the quietest of guests I do think that we probably would still hear mumblings if they spoke quieter. This shouldn't put you off too much as most nights we were so tired that we slept for England although we did get woken up earlier than we would have liked due to our noisy neighbours.

Apparently the fee has been set by the local government from the airport to anywhere in the city, no matter how long - 40 euro\u2019s. The hotel is quite difficult to find if you don\u2019t get a taxi as it has no sign outside and is in a residential street. Our room number was 403. This was on the fourth floor, top left hand corner looking from the front. The room was compact. Double bed, flat screen Tv on the wall, wardrobe, free digital safe in the wardrobe, table and chair. The room had air con which you could adjust the level yourself and was an absolute god send as the temp. were in the low 30\u2019s! Double French doors lead onto a balcony which stretched from the side right round the front. Two chairs and a table outside to have a wine at. Bathroom was very clean. With the usual shampoo\u2019s etc. Shower water pressure very good and plenty of hot water. The hotel changed the towels everyday. The mattresses on the beds are memory foam type. Both my wife and I found these very comfortable but some may find them a bit hard. There was a small bar area where you had free use of a PC with internet access. Just ask at reception for a password. Great for booking your Vatican tickets. Just use the hotels email address and they will print your tickets out. The breakfast area was spotless. Breakfast consisted of fruit juices, tea, coffee, cereals croissants, rolls etc. Basically a continental breakfast. Certainly enough to set you up for the day and ALWAYS fresh and plentiful supplies of produce. The lady who runs it was brilliant. The reception staff were some of the most helpful Hotel staff I have ever come across. Many thanks. There is a supermarket in the square, Punto, quite cheap all the locals use it. The cash machine is also in the square, 2nd turn off in the square. We also found a local coffee shop, Pompei, (also 2nd left turn off) which served great coffee\u2019s and there specialty was tiramisu! Yummy! 3.60 euro\u2019s for 2 coffee\u2019s! On the evening all the locals come out into the Re Di Roma square for an ice cream. Old and young alike, just shooting the breeze and eating ice cream, wonderful! You can see the Metro station from the front of the hotel. Quick, easy and cheap access to Rome. If you use one of the maps that reception provides, the Colosseum is a 20 minute walk away. We found the area very safe and did not feel intimidated at all. The only downside. No decent restaurants nearby.

The breakfast was solid, nice croissants, cappucino machine, cereals, cold cuts, fresh fruit, etc. Our room was spacious and the bed was big (two twins combined) and comfortable. We had a street side room on the 2nd floor, but the windows were well insulated and the curtains kept the light out of the room to the point where we slept in and didn't know what time it was. The walls contained noises for the most part, but we could hear people in the other rooms at times. Aside from that we always came back to a very clean room, and kudos to the housekeeper for organizing and packing all toiletries (my wife was impressed). The shower was smallish, but water pressure was great and really all that was needed. The location of the hotel was literally one block and a half from the Re di Roma Metro stop. You can ride the metro for 1 euro, if you are not familiar with the Rome Metro it is very easy to use. For a euro at the machine you get a metro card and that card is good for 75 minutes, so if you need to go from the orange line (A) to the blue line (B), it is not a problem. Or you can do a 1 day card (4 euros) or a 3 day card (11 euros). The metro basically takes you to the areas where all the top tourist attractions are (Colloseum, Vatican, Spagna steps & Trevi fountain, Piazza Nuvona) with some walking required. From the airport the most affordable and best route is to take the Leonardo Express Train (14 euros) to Termini station. At Termini you have to walk pretty far to the Termini Metro lines, and up and down some stairs, so if you are not physically capable of carrying your luggage, this route may not be recommended. Once in the metro take the orange line (A) in the Angannani(?) direction about 4 stops to Re di Roma, then once at Re di Roma follow the signs \"Via Vercelli\" and once up the stairs from the metro you walk a block and a half and the hotel is on your left (small red awnings). At the Re di Roma roundabout there was some shops & takeaway food, also a supermarket tucked in, a perfect place to buy affordable water, wine, fruit, etc. for the room. Not a lot of cafes or restaurants in the area (at least not to the tourist eye), but that is what the metro is for to get to the best spots in Rome.

A lovely clean crisp airy spacious room on the first floor, with a lovely bathroom - very clean and fresh and new, firm comfortable beds with nice pillows, tv, lounging chair, writing table and a massive balcony. A generous fresh and plentiful breakfast every morning, with tasty coffee, croissants, fruit and cereal. All you would need to set you up for the day. Really helpful staff - answered every query fully and with good grace - keen to offer help with reservations, directions and recommendations for restuarants etc. I would definitely stay here on my return to Rome - I'm sure there are other lovely hotels, but when you've stayed in one this good, why try anywhere else. It was just a couple of minutes walk from the metro which took you into the centre of town in 4 stops, and ten minutes walk from the mainline train which comes directly from the airport for 8 euros. In a neighbourhood type area so away from the hustle bustle, but in a good way. If I had to be negative about anything, it would be the thin walls - I had read this in other reviews and took earplugs incase, but if you wear yourself out in the day you 're too tired to worry about other people's noises.

It's been quite a few years since we ventured out of the UK and I was a bit apprehensive over what to expect despite the reviews. Well I can tell you I need no have worried as the hotel was excellent. We found the hotel easily thanks to other reviewers comments about train travel and the not having a noticeable sign outside until you get to the front door. (I virtual walked it from the station beforehand using google maps) It was located a bit away from the centre of Rome but it was a mere 40 minutes on the train from the airport (Tuscolana Station, 8 euros) and a hop skip and a jump from Re Di Roma metro station (1 euro for 90 minutes metro/bus travel). In fact we walked to the Colosseum in 30 minutes and that was only strolling. Inside the hotel is very clean and modern. We had a 4th floor corner room with a large balcony and excellent air conditioning. The rooms were the usual european size with a big enough, well equipped bathroom. Their was a mini-bar fridge which was excellent for keeping your own drinks cold as well as a safe in the wardrobe. The maids kept the room spotless every day and the breakfast, whilst continental was OK with a range of croissants, melba toast, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juice etc. I can recommend either asking the lady in charge for a cappuccino or use a large cup and select black coffee twice to fill it and add a dash of milk. The coffee with milk selection was not very nice ;-) I mentioned that the hotel is a bit away from Central Rome but don't let this put you off as the metro line on the same street as the hotel can get you to virtually every major site such as the Vatican, Colosseum and Forum, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, etc etc and runs until 11.30pm mon-fri and 12.30pm Saturday. San Giovanni in Lanterano Basilica is a mere 15 minute stroll.

The 2 complaints about the hotel. 1) Temperature - It was unseasonably cold for the time of year however there is no heat available in the rooms even though there are individual thermostats. The hotel's response - They cannot mix heat and air conditioning so they prefer to leave it as air-conditioning as it is generally hot this time of year. The rooms were very cold at night and difficult to sleep at times. We requested additional blankets that never came. 2) Housekeeping - The drain to the tub was very sluggish and the shower water would fill up above my ankles when taking a shower. I have communicated to the hotel every day and it was never fixed. I am not a high maintenance traveler but at minimum I do require the rooms to be clean (the rest of the room was clean with the exception of the bath tub drain) thus left a negative impression of the hotel.

The staff was excellent and always answered the many questions we had about anything! When I arrived, my baggage was delayed and Georgio was working the front desk when we checked in. He followed up with the airline many times over the first 2 days to check on the status of my bag as well as letting me know when it was supposed to be delivered. The room we were in was located on the 2nd floor and had a rather large balcony that wrapped around to the front of the building. The room was very clean and modern and had a refrigerator as well as a desk and plenty of outlets. The free wireless that they provide is also of good quality and we never had any connection problems during our stay. You will need to get a code from the front desk for each computer that you plan on using and they usually last for a period of 3 days. If you are there longer than that, you just go to the front desk and ask for a new code. Some have said that the hotel is not located close to transportation, but the Re di Roma Metro station is only about a block and a half away from the hotel. This station is on the A line and can be taken into Termini Station to meet up with the B line that will also take you to other places throughout Rome. While the Hotel is in a residential area, the Metro runs late enough each evening that you can go anywhere in the city within minutes to find a meal (or dessert!) after the local shops have closed for the evening. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that is traveling to Rome for the first (or even second!) time that doesn't have a problem with friendly staff, nice rooms and maybe some walking! My only complaints (and they aren't that big) are that they really need a shower curtain on the shower so that you don't have to worry about watering the floor each time and that it would be nice if they were to change up the breakfast items at least a few times a week - just for variety! Also - a TIP for those staying here - when you get into your room and can't figure out why the lights don't work.. you need to put your room card (attached to the key) into the little slot in the wall by the front door to the room - this will turn on the power to the room as well as turn on a little red light outside of your room to let the staff know that you are in the room (there were no \"Do not Disturb\" signs that we could find).", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cservice with a smile ; )\u201d", "Author": "Dub_Claire", "ReviewID": "UR58242731", "Content": "Small hotel located a few metro stops away from the city centre.

The breakfast was average, coffee was terrible - and in Italy bad coffee is a crime! The hotel decor was very moderrn and stylish, and the room was much the same. The plumbing was a little suspect - the sink was very slow to drain, and after flushing the toilet a trick was required to stop it flushing. Also, the walls were paper thin, so be prepared to share the intimate details of your neighbours relationships! The location of the hotel was fine, and easily accessible to most places via the Metro which is very close by. Restaurants in the neighbourhood were not the best Rome has to offer.

We had not eaten since early in the day on our trip down from Florence, so we were looking for a place to eat in the area. Enter Louis, the Michelin of Re di Roma. Louis recommended a great little neighborhood fish eatery right near the hotel. Over the next three days and nights, Louis became our gourmet guide. Every one of his recommendations was great. All were little restaurants within walking distance from the hotel and all with great homecooked food, fun local wines and wonderful Roman ambiance. We did not encounter another English speaking person in any of the restaurants that we visited. But, the Romans were welcoming and always apologizing for their broken English. My response was always that they did not have to apologize to us; we should accommodate them. They were all perfect hosts. And the food in every one of those restaurants that Louis recommended was fantastic. The hotel is a little out of the way; but its accessibility to the Metro makes all the difference in the world. We went everywhere on the Metro, except to the Colosseum, where we walked.(about 30 minutes). The hotel is pretty basic with comfortable rooms and a decent buffet breakfast. It really did not matter because all of Rome was accessible from the hotel due to the proximity of the Metro. The other staff people were very accommodating and friendly; free internet access and a nice cozy bar and common area room. And, as to the neighborhood. Well, in the daylight it is much less menacing and once you realize where you are it is quite an interesting part of town.

At no point should you co underneath the railway bridge, whichever way you exit the station, if you do this you're already wrong! All i would say is from the main tuscolana road, look up in the hill for a tall church spire with a blue neon cross on the top, head for that and you cant go wrong! The hotel was excellent, not difficult to spot as i had looked at pictures of the outside before arriving. Very comfortable, extremely clean and a good breakfast. Consisted of cereal, fruit, yoghurt, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, bread, croissants, had, cheese...etc. served from 0700-10am so gives you a good lie-in! The only complaint i would have about the hotel is the walls are quite thin and for some reason the people above us decided to move furniture around the room at about 10pm every night. Other than that is is a quiet area, and nice to be away from the main city. Having said that we comfortably walked from the hotel to the colosseum and roman forum(about 30mins), we walked from there to the piazza navona, trevi fountain, spanish steps, and pantheon. we did get a tube home but is is a good way to get around as you dont miss things. the tube we paid 11euros for a 3 day pass and its 1euro for 75minutes on the underground. very similar to london underground, and very quick. takes roughly 5-10 minutes from the main termini to the re di roma stop and about 20 minutes to the stop for the vatican, which i think is also walking distance but some may disagree!! Maybe not there and back! We had a guided tour of the vatican city museums, sistine chapel, and st peters, it was very expensive (35 euros pp inclu entrance fee that is 14euros alone) but well worth it. It is the only tour we did and the only one i believe we needed, but we wouldn't have got nearly as much out of if without it, plus there was no queuing. When we went to the colosseum there were people everywhere touting for tours. telling us the queue was 2hours long. Well we decided against it and queued. Well 20mins later we were in. Prob the time of year more than anything. 12euros entrance for the colossum and roman forum which is a good 2-3hour visit. Eating out.............beware of the piazza navona. we had a pizza for 13euros, pasta for 18euros and 2 beers, not even pints.........9euros each!! the hotel recommended restaurants near the hotel which we excellent. The trattatoria for a good selection of traditional italian food, reasonably priced. ASTI - a proper pizzaria, made and stonebaked in front of you, again, well priced, and bar pompei, which is famous for tirimasu......people travel from all over the city to have the tiramisu here. Beautiful, and each one within 5minutes walk from the hotel. Once again, wonderful trip, fascinating place and perfect hotel, and perfect time of year in my opinion! would NEVER visit rome in the summer......queues and heat.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire, England", "Title": "\u201cFantastico!\u201d", "Author": "Red-ally", "ReviewID": "UR48905153", "Content": "Wonderful hotel.

All responses were given within 1 hour which impressed me. Upon arrival at the airport, my transportation was there waiting for me with a sign. I arrived at the hotel early in the morning and the hotel was in the midst of cleaning my room so I waited in the bar area for about 30 minutes. The contemporary design was very pleasant and the computer / wi-fi internet was free as promised. The room was clean and small but typical of Eurpoean hotel size. The hotel has been recently renovated and the rooms reflected it. The beds were comfortable and the towels were generous. The only problem in the bathroom was the drainage. Both the sink and shower would overflow since the faucet and showerhead were too powerful for the drains to catch up and I had to start and stop the shower or reduce the waterflow but this was a minor problem. The front staff reception was extremely helpful and spoke perfect English. They went out of there way to help me with my transportation and even looked up bus schedules for me. Their breakfast was average but sufficed since I'm not a big breakfast eater. Baked goods, a few meats, and juice were offered. I was worried about the location since this is far from many of the main attractions of Rome. This did not become an issue since the hotel is only two blocks from both metro and bus stops, which is really the best way to get around the city.

The only other thing lacking (& this is the case right thru Europe & Egypt) is tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms. The breakfast room is smallish but we had no problems in getting a table. It would be good if light evening meals could be provided, even if only omelettes or toasted sandwiches. The breakfast room staff & housekeeping staff were always very friendly & helpful.

The hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood but close to several shops at the Piazza Re di Roma and Appia Way - which goes directly to San Giovanni in Laterno (a must see). The hotel itself is about a hundred meters from the Re di Roma metro stop on the A line (the one with air conditioning) that can quickly take you to virtually all the major sites.

The minibar was much more reasonably priced than one would find at an American hotel and there was room in the fridge left over to BYO provisions, which can be purchased at a neighborhood grocery or the one in Termini station. The only drawbacks were 1) the thin walls from which I could hear water running in the staff closet next door but my room was between that closet and the stairwell so I didn't hear any noise from other travelers and 2) the lack of variety in the daily breakfast buffet. Don't get me wrong. There was a wide variety of items on the buffet but it was the same stuff (croissants, cereal, biscuits, ham, cheese, salami, yogurt, pineapple and orange juice and coffee/cappuccino, fruit) every day and that got to be a little boring by the end of the week.

We chose this hotel, after consulting this site. The location is not what i would have thought from reading the reviews. Dont get me wrong, we found the place in not much time. We arrived at Ciampino airport, got a bus from there to Anagnina (\u20ac1.20 from the ticket office in the airport) and then got the underground from Anagnina to Re Di Roma stop. The area seemed to be entirely residential, but this didn't put us off. After a short stroll and some advice from a really friendly guy working in the local Forbidden Planet! (who hadn't heard of the hotel and lived in the area, he checked with his boss, phoned his friend and then checked google after double checking i had the name right!) the hotel was about 100 yards from where he was and he hadnt heard of it! If i was returning to Rome, i'd much rather stay somewhere more central, however the metro system was adequate and very reasonably priced. One way tickets are \u20ac1, all day (for use on buses and trains are \u20ac4 and a 3 day pass can be bought for \u20ac11. The machines in the station only give maximum \u20ac4 change, so make sure you have change! Never matter, we got there fine and had no problem checking in, the staff were very attentive and friendly. We had appr 20 minutes to wait for our room, which was fine. We had booked directly through the hotel. We had found some pretty good offers on various sites, and when we contacted the hotel, they could give us an even better rate (\u20ac79 per night, b&b), we secured this booking with the hotel by phone and everything was fine. The room didnt have a balcony, however this wasnt too much of a problem as the view was a few apartment blocks across the road! The air con was very good, the rooms were lovely, very modern, the bed wasnt too comfortable, but adequate for our needs. The bathroom was lovely and had a good pressure shower. If i was being extremely picky, i'd mention that there was a blue streak of cleaning detergent running down one of the walls in the bathroom, which was there for the duration of our stay, but it had no impact on our opinion. Breakfast was fine, meat, salami, cheese, breadrolls, fruit juice, cereal, croissants, yogurt, tea, coffee etc. Enough to keep you going until late lunch. The only problem we had, was on checking out this morning, the member of staff at the desk had quite a problem with the amount we were to pay (\u20ac237 for 3 nights) and asked if i had time til he checked this out, i explained we had no time as we had to go to the airport. I had the confirmation from the hotel, but this was not sufficient from what i could see. He hummed and aah'd for a while, looking at the invoice which had already been written out for us (\u20ac355 i think) and comparing it to what i had put in front of him. After almost 10 embarrassing minutes for me (there was a large queue forming behind me) he managed to find his copy of the confirmation i had (it was undernrath 2 sheets of paper!), which had the rate we were given highlighted in blur marker pen!! he took the money, and never said thanks or anything, we left and that was pretty much it.

Also since the last metro train runs just before midnight, the opportunities for a late night stroll through beautiful Rome, with gelato in hand, may be sadly limited.

Actually it's also near a good pizza restaurant, inexpensive chinese restaurant, newsstand with English magazines (not papers), McDonalds and a nice toy store. When you're done with the metro, it's only EUR 10 back in a taxi and we were never ripped off or taken the long way home. In Amsterdam for comparison, EUR 10 only gets you an argument with the driver. We were cheated and tried to be cheated almost every ride. It was worse than the third world there.

Breakfast is fairly good, bread rolls, cheese and ham, and the usual assortment of spreads, ( tho no yogurts or eggs). If you are travelling from Fiumcianno (L.d.Vinci) Airport take the local Sabina train to Tuscolana station (about 30-40 mins from Fiumcianno, L.d.Vinci) its only e5.50. (the other alternative which is the Leonardo Express takes you into rome centre for e11.00 and then a further e1.00 to take you to Re di Roma). make sure to validate your train ticket in the yellow machines BEFORE boarding, the inspectors on the trains dont seem to have a lot of sympathy if you get this wrong. on leaving tuscolana station walk out onto Via Tuscolana which is a big main street and turn right, walk for about five mins. Via Vercelli is the last street on left, if you overshoot, you will find yourself at the roundabout also called Re di Roma, and via vercelli runs off this roundabout, so you definately wont get lost. This roundabout is also where you get the metro which is simple to navigate, Re di Roma is on the red line which runs up to 11.30pm.

I was a little concerned with the location of the hotel as, when looking at the map, it appears to be well out of the way of the major sights. I shouldn't have worried, however, because there is a Metro stop literally at the end of the street and it's only 4 stops away from the main Termini. Plus, all day Metro travel tickets cost a paltry 4 euros, and the Metro line it is on (Line A) will take you all the way to the Vatican without needing to change! The hotel's surrounding area, whilst not particularly scenic, is none-the-less fine and was quiet on the nights we were there. Ideal to get away from the grid-locked and noisey Rome centre in my opinion. I won't comment on Rome itself as it's not really relevant to a review of this hotel, save to say it's rather a dirty, graffiti covered city and very expensive on the food and especially drinks. Back to the hotel; the guy on reception was very helpful even when obviously very tired and gave us restaurant tips and a map of the Rome area. The rooms where clean and looked rather chic; the twin beds were very firm and comfortable and the bathroom was clean and modern with an excellent shower. The aircon unit worked flawlessly, was quiet and did a great job of making the room sleepable! There was a free-to-use safe in the room as well as a small mini-bar. Prices of the mini-bar and the bar of the hotel itself weren't too badly priced (not compared to the rest of Rome that's for sure!). Breakfast was in with the price and was a basic buffet style; juice, tea, coffee, croissants, cereal, ham, cheese, bread etc. Nothing spectacular but decent enough to get the carbs in before exploring all the sights of Rome! The only bad thing I can say is that one the first night there, during the middle of the night, there was a foul sewerage-type smell in the room. I never figured out where it came from but it was only present on the first night and didn't cause us any real issues.

I found it as I was already getting frustrated with lack of affordable options in reasonable locations.

The hotel has a modern, unmistakable Italian look inside and appears new and spotlessly clean. My room was amply sized with all amenities I wanted and some I did not - writing desk, fridge, safe and even a big balcony with table and two chairs! I loved the design of the furniture, colour coordination and laminated floors. Enough power outlets everywhere, good sized bathroom. My only complaint is lack of shower curtain and not being able to tighten the showerhead holder to keep it raised - probably a defective one. Overall nothing worth writing home to complain about. Wireless internet was free and very fast; multiple access points and access passes - professionally done. The service from the staff was excellent, they were always helpful with directions and recommendations. Breakfast was buffet style and included everything I would wish for; if I needed to be picky, I would have preferred pastries to be better (that is Rome and they certainly do know how to make them - try them in any bar). But given the availability of toast, all kinds of spreads including Nutella, several flavours of very good yogurt, cheese, salami and cooked ham, there's again nothing of importance to complain about. Tip: ask attendant for a cappuccino or espresso as they will make one in the kitchen and it's better than the machine in the dining room will make. I was aware of the location and am overall satisfied with it. It's reasonably close to the metro station and as you should expect to walk a lot in Rome, it will not present any trouble. Just don't expect to drag a lot of luggage from the airport to the hotel - my recommendation is to come with carry-on only or leave big bags at the Termini if you're on a multi-city tour. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel and believe I have gotten one of the best deals in Rome. I am not sure why it's only rated 3 stars, most likely it is missing some amenity like restaurant or pool because what it does provide, it provides superbly. The reviews were certainly true.

There`s alot of hotels on offer in Rome so it can be very tricky picking which one would be - 1. value for money 2. close to attraction 3. nice hotel to stay at ( services etc ). I`m so glad i read the reviews on trip advisor the hotel had recieved prior to us leaving it made staying in Rome a more enjoyable experience. The english speaking staff are really excellent their more than happy to answer any question you have, which my partner and i had alot including best shopping spots, restraunts, transport, general getting around (metro/bus). The price for our stay was the even cheapier than the doggie less star hotels we found online. So when you book ( which you will ), try to do it in advance online as they have really good prices, even half what you would pay if you booked days in advance. The price includes a continental breakfast every morning which has cereal`s, toast, juice, coffee, fruit`s, cold meats etc a good meal to stay your site seeing day. The rooms are also excellent, cleaned daily, tasteful decor and big compaired to Italy standards with all nessecary items and your own bathroom. Only thing we found alittle annoying was that walls are very thin so when the guest next door showered you could hear the water runnning, and at 5.30am they must have not been on holidays ! They have a lift for any special need guest`s or for us lazy ones to avoid the stairs (5 levels). They have free interent connection (wifi) for those who have laptop`s, but if you don`t they supply free internet on a guest only computer which is a nice touch and very handy for getting in touch with love ones. I highly recommend Hotel Re Di Roma !!! Save your time reading and looking for best prices and book with these guys you wouldn`t be dissappointed like many other travels who have stayed !

Have the staff recommend some. They are the type of restaurants without English on the menu, but the waiters still speak excellent English. Family run type places, wonderful Oh, one important tip. If you book the hotel, make sure you contact them before your arrival, and ask them to arrange a driver from the airport, it is much cheaper. We paid $70 for a cab from the airport to the hotel, but when they arranged the limo for our return to the airport, it only cost $40.

I think that the building was converted a few years ago into a hotel, so everything looks fairly modern and is in good state. In the room there was no noise from the street. We could only hear the neighbours in the morning but they were very reasonable. The room was more like a small suite, therefore we had plenty of space. We did not really have the feeling that we were in a hotel room. There was not much selection nor much room to sit at breakfast, but I guess that this is okay if you are not too pretentious. Of course the Italian breakfast is not usually very rich. We took the suggestion on TripAdvisor and ordered capuccino, avoiding the standard coffee. The guy at the reception was friendly, could speak English and guided us to the next door parking (quite expensive by the way, but there is no parking on the street, not to mention that foreign plates are guaranteed to give you troubles with the local burglars.

I would also recommend going to Rome the last weekend in the month as on the last Sunday you can get into the Vatican for free.

Yes, it's in a quieter residential district, yes, you can't see the sights from your bedroom window, but so what! We found it an advantage to return to the peace and comfort of the Re di Roma at the end of each day. Connections - a 2 minute walk to the Metro line A, with an entrance/exit onto Via Vercelli itself. From Ciampino airport, you must take the Cotral bus to Anagnina stop and then the A train to Re di Roma stop, will take about 45 minutes, journey cost 2.20euros. A day pass on the metro/bus/tram costs 4.00euros - great value, we used all three. A 5 minute walk from the hotel takes you to San Giovanni, with buses to all points in the city. But if you want to walk it, the Colosseum is a 20 minute walk from the hotel. Hotel - this is a smart/ boutique/comfortable/3 star ish/ great value hotel. The staff are welcoming and very helpful, all speak good english. Breakfasts are fine, ask for a cappuccino from the waitress. WIFI and internet downstairs. Bedrooms and bathrooms are very good indeed, quite chic really. And the price, we paid about 280 euros for 3 nights, and this has to be amongst the best value hotels in the City. we had a balcony too which in better weather would be a real bonus. Sights - buy a guide book! We took the 110open bus, which covered all the locations. Tips - if you go to the Vatican and want to see the Sistine Chapel, don't join the line in St Peters Square, you need to follow the signs for the Vatican museum/Sistine Chapel, a 10 minute walk from St Peters Square. Food - it will be difficult to eat badly, but we managed to avoid any touristy haunts apart from the occasional coffee in the larger squares. We assumed that if a restaurant was very busy, cramped, and full of Italians, then it had to be pretty good. We also ate very reasonably too. We would recommend Pizzeria Da Ivo and Pannattoni in Trastevere, Pizzeria La Montecarlo on Vicolo Savelli close to Piazza Navona, Restaurant Raf off Via Cola Di Rienzo near the Vatican. The best was Aquila d'Abruzzo on Via Aosta, only 5 minutes from the hotel and recommened by the hotel, truly delicious food, pasta, pizza, fish and meat - don't expect anything fancy, just great food, service and plenty of locals.

The hotel was very clean and seemed either new or recently renovated -- done in a very modernist style. The room was quite large (we had expected a tiny space), and we had plenty of room in the bathroom, too. There wasn't a charge for the internet service, but we couldn't get the internet to work in our room. Our computer did work in the main lobby, though, and we could use a computer provided by the hotel at no cost.

Breakfast is adequate - sets you up for the day although can get a bit dull by the 3rd day with the same selection of cold items each day, but this is standard in most Rome hotels and is only a slight negative! The location for the metro is great - approx 200 metres walk to the metro station from the hotel door and 1 euro will get you anywhere you want to go for the next 75 minutes. We did walk into Rome 3 out of the 5 days and this only took approx 30 minutes to the Colosseum. The walk with take you past the San Giovanni Basillica (Rome's cathedral) - this is definately worth a stop - beautiful building inside and out. The hotel is located in a more residential area and can be easily walked past however the directions we followed from the hotel's own website got us right to the door (it helped that I studied photos online of the hotel so could spot it straight away!) from the airport using the Cotral bus from Ciampino airport to Anangina metro station (cost of 1.20 euro each) and then the metro from Anangina to Re Di Roma (1 euro each). Great value to get us to the hotel for only 2.20 euro each and was an easy transport system to navigate. We did get a taxi back to airport for our return flight to ensure we weren't late, booked by the hotel for us and cost 30 euro. Good local restaurants if you want to spend some time out of the city centre in the evenings - Chinese round the corner 2 minute walk away (on Via Bobbio), Bombay (Indian Restaurant) about 5 mins walk away and great traditional pizzeria recommended by the hotel only 5 mins away. We will definately return to Rome and would go back to this hotel - we got a great deal on lastminute.com, paying only \u00a3335 for the 5 night stay.

Our room was impeccably clean, and the entire hotel has a very new, chic and modern look to it. While we were there, the room was cleaned thoroughly and promptly each day. The property certainly has all the amenities required to be classified as a hotel - such as mini-bar in room, free cable TV, 24/7 desk service, shampoo & hair dryer in room - but yes, it is a smaller hotel and certainly will not offer everything a larger hotel would, such as a pool. But this is why you are paying $250 per night instead of $500-$700 night that you can easily pay for a much larger hotel in Rome at this time of year! This hotel is great, great value for money, and I found the amenities and services offered more than adequate. The location is not in the direct city center, but again, you get what you pay for - if you want to be within a few minutes walking of the city center, you will pay $100s more per night. I still found this very convenient to all the sites in Rome - 30 minutes walking from the Colosseum (which is where the Ancient City also is), and an easy ride on the subway to Roma Termini train station (only four stops, which takes less than 10 minutes). This location was actually far, far more convenient than I expected, based on the reviews I read before booking and arriving that said it was not centrally located. The neighborhood does have some graffiti and I was cautious about safety when we first arrived. But after a day, we realized that the neighborhood is very residential and we had no issues with walking around to get to dinner, etc. If anything, because the neighborhood is residential and not touristy, the restaurants in this area were some of the best I ate at in an entire two-week trip to Italy - \"real\" Italian food that wasn't catering more to tourist tastes.

The hotel was clean by Rome standards, although it was far from perfect (bedding and carpets were stained, the skirting was falling off the bedroom wall, with a layer of dust over room during entire stay). Free Sky TV and cheap mini bar were a big bonus. The continental breakfasts were good, with cappuccino available upon request, which was lovely. The breakfast room is too small to cater for all.

Food was however fresh and plentiful. Staff were always polite and friendly, with reception helpful and speaking very good English. The hotel booked a car to take us to and from the airport. It cost 40 Euros, and is a service I would recommend, since taxi prices are much the same, and the Metro line is notorious for pick-pockets looking for travellers with their hands full of luggage. The hotel building itself is old. Sound proofing is not very good, expect to get a fright every time your neighbour flushes the toilet - it woke me up more than once! The hotel is a bit outside the city centre, and I hadn't fully prepared myself for all that would entail. It was a bit more of an inconvenience than anticipated, having to rely on the Metro system or a 30 minute walk to reach the main attractions. The Re Di Roma area is a typical city suburb, highly built up, unclean and covered in graffiti. When we first arrived at the hotel my heart sank when I saw the location. We didn't however experience any safety issues. I mentioned this because at least if you are aware of this before you go you know what to expect.

We paid about 90 Euros or so (i think) a night for two twin beds (of which we requested) which I thought was excellent value for money. Briefly, here are some reasons why I recommend this hotel: -Simple and modern furnishings/design (very chic) -Good shower pressure!!!! -Conveniently located (literally 2 mins from the metro) -It\u00b4s CLEAN!! The cleaners clean the rooms everyday, replace the toiletries, and change dirty towels and sheets/pillowcases -The staff are really nice, friendly and approachable (they gave us a bottle of water the day we left to take with us because they knew we had to lug our luggages all the way to Termini in the boiling heat.

The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, the decor, fixtures, and amenities were modern, and the space in the room and bathroom was ample for two people. The front desk staff was available 24/7 and, while they weren't brimming with travel advice or tourist tips, they were always courteous and helpful with any of our requests (bottled water, Internet use, wake-up call, etc.) We found the breakfast to be great -- cute breakfast room with warm bread and croissants, meats, cheeses, cereal, yogurt, fruit, juice, tea, and coffee -- a hearty continental breakfast. Sadly, we missed breakfast the first day, b/c there was no alarm clock in the room, and we couldn't figure out how to call the front desk for a wake up call on the first night (the room was so dark from the blackout curtains and quiet we slept late!), but the second day, we really enjoyed the breakfast and wished we had it the first day. The common areas included a little bar area with a computer available for internet use, the breakfast room, and a cozy sitting area. Our room had a comfortable king size bed (two twins that easily pushed together) with crisp white linens, a small desk and cupboard with a mini-fridge, safe, and rod for hanging clothes, a full-length mirror, bench, flat panel tv with lots of channels (including a few in English), and a cute balcony with a bistro table and two chairs. Our bathroom had a decent-sized shower and tub, sink, toilet, bidet, and plenty of fluffy towels. The only weird thing about the bathroom was the lack of shower curtain/shower door. There was a half wall, but even by holding the shower handle in your hand, it was next to impossible not to spray water into the rest of the bathroom. So we spread some of the towels out to try to absorb the water that went everywhere, but it still left the bathroom a bit wet. This was a minor inconvenience, but not a huge deal. The Re di Roma is not in the heart of the city, but it is literally a 2 minute walk to a Metro stop -- and that stop is a 10-15 minute ride to the main city attractions. We bought the Roma Pass for 20 euros which allowed us to travel unlimited by bus or train for three days (plus 2 free museum entry fees!), and so we hopped on and off the Metro for most of our travel. Be careful if you are staying out late though, b/c the Metro stops running around 10, and then you'll have to find a bus or cab back to the hotel (which is no big deal, but is good to know).

Unfortunately the lady serving was not quick enough to fill up the buffet and when we arrived there was a lack of bread and croissant. After a great hot shower we decided to walk to the coliseum but got totally lost as we are rubbish at map reading. It would have been a lot less stressful to get the metro. It is not too far if you can read maps! After a fantastic day seeing the sites, we returned to our well tidied room. The maid had hung our coats up and cleaned round. We ventured out around 9pm and headed down the main road and beyond the piazza. We found a great little restaurant/pizzeria that was sign posted off the main road. No one could speak English and we could not speak Italian but that did not matter, the staff were amazing and helped us with sign language and lots of laughs. The bill for two, with starters, mains, deserts and a bottle wine came to only 26 euros! All in all the hotel Re di Roma is great if you don\u2019t want tourist heaven. It is not in an area where you will be ripped off but you do have to get metro, taxi or walk quite far if you want to spend time in the centre. The metro only costs 1 euro to get into the centre and only takes a few minutes. I will definitely stay in this hotel again and recommend it to anyone who likes to break from the mould.", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "LondonApm", "ReviewID": "UR13777949", "Content": "What a fantastic hotel! My partner and I had never been to Rome, and so I simply booked a hotel which was affordable and purely by chance it was the Re di Roma. Having travelled to Italy with a fourteen month old, we took nothing for granted. I phoned the hotel and asked for a transfer from the airport, and sure enough we were greeted at the arrival gate by a smart driver in a brand new Mercedes people carrier. OK, 60 Euros isn't cheap, but the reassurance of being transported quickly and efficiently with our assorted bags, stroller etc, made us book the return journey. On arrival at the hotel we found that we didn't have a travel cot in the room - no problem, within 10 minutes the attentive staff had ensured that it arrived and was put up for us. The room and bathroom were clean and modern with comfortable furnishings and plenty of storage space. In terms of location, the hotel may look as if it is on the periphery of the city. However, the actual walking time between major sites was less than half an hour, and with a metro stop a few metres away longer trips, e.g. the vatican, were easy to organise. On the downside, our neighbours decided to listen to their TV at full blast, and the coffee at breakfast wasn't great (just ask for an espresso instead). These are trivial matters however, and should not detract from the fact that the hotel is a great place to stay, with friendly staff and an excellent location from which to enjoy the eternal city!", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly no fuss\u201d", "Author": "vincent78", "ReviewID": "UR13750717", "Content": "We have just returned from a 4 day stay at this small new hotel.

(believe me -after a week in Italy you would be longing to hear spoken english) Nice and quiet location. Just a few mins walk from the Re di Roma station which is only a few minutes away from the main attractions by tube. The hotel itself is only 10 miles from the Ciampino airport which costs 30-40Euros by Taxi. But beware - we were charged 80 Euros by the Taxi guy who was running on a meter!!! So never get on a taxi unless you know how much it costs from A--> B. Eugenio who recieved us was our local tour guide. He made our trip entirely worth it. Gave us all the local info we needed. Also gave me a CD to copy my photos. The PC downstairs has internet access but I wasn't charged for using the PC to download pics from my camera into my mem stick. But the best thing abount our stay was Eugenio's hospitality. Having said that the rest of the staff are very helpful too. Amazing breakfast...esp. the croissants. Very good room service.

We stayed at Re Di Roma, in Rome and we enjoyed a lot the hotel :). The staff was very nice, the hotel is brand new and extremely well cared. The design is very pleasant, the reading room is really nice, the bar is also nice and the breakfast room is really nice. The rooms are small, but very clean, with nice colors and pleasant furniture. Simple but classy :). We stayed at the 502, and we had a small terrace, which is not a common feature for all the rooms :). The TV stays at the wall, a black flat TV, and all the electric system works with a card, which is provived with the romm keys. They display several channels, but the SKY package is paid, only one or two channels are free. However, the offer is large and you can pick any tipy of channel you want. No english speaking films, everything is italian spoken :S...The bathroom is great: very clean, the design is simple but nice, the bath is good size...I liked the breakfast, despite some people says is not enough: croissants, bread, tea, milk, cereals, toasts, coffee( you can ask for an expresso or a cappucino to the lady, if you don't like the coffe :)) and much more...we always got place easily in the room, so, it\u00b4s easy to catch a place...

There is a supermarket just a few blocks away. Lots of good places to eat and shop. Rome is not a very large city, so once we got to one spot, other attractions were just a short walk away. The breakfast is very modest, consisting of just salami, ham, swiss cheese, canned fruit, fresh fruit, 2 types of cereal, yogurt, juice, breads and coffee. Very typical in Europe.
