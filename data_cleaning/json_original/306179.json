I chose this hotel due to the reviews on TripAdvisor -- we weren't disappointed! We arrived around 2:AM in the morning and were greeted nicely upon arrival by the front desk. He gave us a great recommendation on a hawker stall down the street to grab a bite since we were starving! We were already familiar with the area, and can say that this hotel is in a GREAT location. The decor is very modern and simple, which we really liked. The room was TINY, but comfortable and had a mini-fridge with complimentary soda. The shower doubled as the toilet stall -- but having lived in Asia, that's nothing abnormal. The bed was average -- it was little noisy due to a bar or restaurant that was right across of the hotel, but nothing that kept us up. They gave us late check-out as we had arrived so late in the reservation -- very helpful as we wanted to explore for a while and didn't have anywhere to take our luggage. The room was approx. $187 SGD for the night. Yes, a little high for how tiny the room was, but as it was a boutique hotel and the location was good, I'd happily stay there again on my next visit.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide", "Title": "\u201cTerrific!\u201d", "Author": "HTEvansAdelaide", "ReviewID": "UR128246908", "Content": "This hotel is situated in a fantastic location, minutes away from China town and minutes away by foot to the nearest MRT in Outram Park.

Comfortable room, good bed, sink, little table, lamp, stationaries, soap, alarm clock. in the bath room, no bath tub but shower next to toilet, nice towel, towelette, shampoo, bath gel. Yes, basic - but with it's prime shopping location, you do not really want to spend any time - longer than necessary coup up inside the hotel! I was there on a Friday and the hotel had some renovations undertaken so it was noisy. On arrival, I was made immediately aware by the hotel staff who apologies profusely and reassured me that the noise would be over by 6 pm. They were true to their word. The lobby staff were very helpful (more so than any 3-star hotel) that i would expect! Before I left, i was given a bottle of water and some biscuits to munch on - in case i was hungry whilst waiting for my taxi. one of the staff member even wished me \"happy birthday\" in advance as they noted that it was in the coming week!

Shocking & Disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Gracieeeeee", "ReviewID": "UR127334119", "Content": "Hotel 1929 had been an extremely disappointing experience for my boyfriend and myself: - Hotel Website - the hotel website is misleading, not to mention that none of the features of the (mutli-functional) mini-size washroom/shower was highlighted... all the pictures featured on the webiste had used wide angles which gave an impression that the room is in relatively \"liveable\" size, in fact... when my bf and myself entered the room, one had to stay in bed in order to allow another person to walk to the washroom. Over Priced - we had many experiences in staying at boutique hotels, and had been enjoying of paying a bit more but enjoying the modern design of the hotel, but this time having paid at a price of 4 star price but you are given a \"cage\" room, and the room has no design at all Room Size - is definitely misleading, as the room is worse than super small, when we checked in, the reception staff told us maybe we should keep some luggage at the reception, since he told us the room is \"quite small\", and he meant it, it's not quite small but unacceptable. There was not even a closet in the room, but only 3 hangers on the wall... Shower & toilet - I was shocked when I realized that the shower and the toilet are in fact within the same small \"area\" which the shower is installed on top of the toilet seat. How come this picture was never shown on their website, nor had they mentioned anything at all? Air Ventilation - the Room is filled with stingy small, and it's very stuffy, even the corridor air is not freshing at all... it didn't give you a very welcoming feeling. Breakfast - While I must acknowledged the fact that the staff serving breakfast is very nice, they need to do a lot towards cleanliness. The fork and knifes given were dirty, filled with food stains, and the plates next to the buffet, had also food stains underneath the plate I picked. How gross can it be especially it's a morning breakfast and you touched all these \"dirty\" cutleries!! Noise - Literally there is no difference than living in on the ground floor, as you can perfectly understand when the truck comes over to pick up the \"trash\" and also the construction workers starts working at 7 am in the morning. There is no quality of sleep at all..... Bed - the room was so small that the bed was pushed to the window side, and one who sleep against the wall/window side, will kept on hitting the curtain which you will be awaken everytime you moved your body... Jacuzzi - Our room is facing directly to the outdoor Jacuzzi, but \"surprisingly\" without even being advised when we booked the hotel via the website, nor upon our check in, that the Jacuzzi was under maintenance. I did consider to try also the same chain \"New Majestic\" nor \"Wonderluxe\" but having read all the reviews, in the future, I will stay on the safe side to avoid these hotels. One advice to all the travellers, be sure to read the reviews by other travellers of the hotel you plan to stay, this time, we didn't have time and the pictures looks awesome of Hotel 1929, but we made a HUGE Mistake!!!

The bed is very comfortable and a wide king single size. Great blockout blinds on both windows so I slept very well - even sleeping in I was so comfortable!! The bathroom is a wet room with lovely green and white tiles. I preferred using the hand-held shower attachment rather than the ceiling rain shower. Nice toiletries and very large towel. I like the basin and mirror near the bed, though the table it sits on has sharp corners and is very close to the edge of the bed. No wardrobe, but I like the wall hanging for clothes near the bed. I do wish there was a little shelf beside the bedhead to put a cup of tea on. All staff are very friendly. Check-in time of 3pm is rather late compared to other hotels, though my bags were stored while I went out sightseeing and when I returned to check-in my bags had been placed in my room. Breakfast in Ember Restaurant near reception was nice. The room is rather dark - a bit difficult to see in that low light at 7.30am. Great coffee - had 3 cups, choice of cooked eggs, bacon, sausage, beans and potato. Plus choice of 2 cereals, toast, croissants, jams and Kaya, tropical fruits, juice.

Our room was clean and provided ample facilities (Air-Con,Safe,Flat Screen TV, i Pod dock) plus a neat little ensuite shower/toilet room. However the most endearing quality of Hotel 1929 was the staff. From the moment we checked in, the reception desk went out of there way to enusre that we were comfortable with the location of the hotel in relation to the major tourists spots and knowing that we had limited time, reccomended we take the city tour bus (Well worth doing). The Hotel has a great location. Situated on the frindge of Chinatown, guests are a walk or short tube ride away from destinations such as Raffles Place, City Hall or Little India, not to mention a stones throw from the bustle of Smith Street where you can enjoy the lively atmosphere over a cold beer and some delicious freshly cooked seafood (Chilli Crab - A must have!). The pick up stop for the city tour bus is just around the corner (opposite the peoples theatre) and to get specific destinations, you are 5 minutes from the Outram Park tube station. Breakfast was basic and ranged from traditional asian dishes to and American style breakfasts (Eggs/Bacon/Toast etc). Perfect, if you need some decent food to set you up for a busy day of exploring or are heading back to the airport to catch your connecting flight. Unfortionately there are some negatives about the Hotel. The walls are noticeably thin which means that sleeping can be difficult if there is music playing at night in the local bars. In summary, we had a short time in Singapore and were primarily looking for somewhere to stay that was comfortable and clean with good facilities.

That said, it's not uncomfortable, although I'd resist recommending it to anyone taller than 6 feet for fear they'd get wedged in the bed and be incapable of checking out the next day. I did see a big guy in the lobby on the evening I checked in, and he seemed pretty cheerful, so perhaps there are some larger rooms. Perhaps. You're not paying for a vast amount of space here; you're getting a good location, on the edge of Chinatown and a short walk into the middle of the city. It's great for me: a 15 minute saunter through Singapore to the office, less than 10 minutes from the MRT. The soundproofing is not that great - from the bed one can hear conversations in the corridor outside, and the door allows a bit of light in from outside as well, but that didn't prevent me from sleeping.

Breakfast itself isn't too remarkable; a combination of toast, cereal, and eggs any way you like them, but it's all fresh and clean. Free wi-fi is something of a bonus, and it gives a good, fast connection to the outside world. The last thing you want when sat in a miniaturised room on your own on a business trip is to feel cut off from the outside world; I could happily talk on Skype without the connection breaking up, which is better than in many more expensive hotels I've stayed in.

Furthermore, the hotel has some nice design features and overall the quality of the furniture is good. I liked the relatively modern design of the rooms. The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice. The shower however was virtually on top of the toilet which is more something one would expect in a youth hostel. The reason for this is that the rooms are absolutely tiny (superior rooms), so this is definitely not recommended for people that like big rooms. For me this is no problem and I actually even wished for a smaller room after the first night in a street-facing deluxe room (which were bigger, perhaps the size of a superior room in other hotels). I asked for the transfer though because the street facing rooms were incredibly noisy (room 209). It seems that the hotel only has single glazing (apart from the ancient outside shutters which give the building its colonial look and feel) which offers absolutely no noise isolation. I was able to overhear normal conversations out on the street and sat straight up in bed when the garbage collectors came by at 1am. Furthermore, you can hear music from karaoke bars down the street.

Even though we stayed at weekdays and the hustle and bustle outside was not at its maximum, we could hear all conversations from the neighbouring bar terraces until late into the night, Not to mention the cars passing just below with a large buzz. Earplugs did not help, so rest was not somehing we could enjoy that much. When we mentioned the noise problem to the reception we were suggested another room - still on the street side but 2 floors up - I doubt that would have helped given the noise level outside. Maybe a room on the inside could have worked, but the hotel was fully booked. Breakfast was just decent, but given the rather low price of the rooms (on Singapore scales) we were not expecting a gigantic buffet. My suggestion: go out and buy a local breakfast in one of the many stalls and small restaurants around. All in all, unless you are looking for sleepless nights in Singapore, look for other accomodation options.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cDecent place to stay for a few nights\u201d", "Author": "Nicodem", "ReviewID": "UR105784459", "Content": "Hotel 1929 is a decent place to stay if you are travelling alone, looking for something simple and like Chinese food.

Jacuzzi also just in front of my hotel room. The only thing I did not enjoy is that the hotel is beside the road, the 1st night there, I had nightmares! Coz it was so noisy outside and my room is only on the 2nd floor. I can't sleep with the noise.. You don't even need to open any lights coz the street lights are enough to illuminate your room. :( But the 2nd night i already know what to expect so I was able to sleep or maybe I am just too tired with the whole day roaming around the city that the noise did not bother my sleep. :) All in all this is definitely a good hotel.

The room i had which was a deluxe room really was teeny and the website gives no indication of size so was very annoyed that it was quite so small, literally there isn't even a foot between bed/bathroom/desk but just about adequate for one person. The desk is pretty much a shelf so you can't work on a laptop properly. The wireless service wouldn't work effectively ( kept losing connection every 5 minutes ) and even using the cable wasn't consistent - the staff tried to sort this out and assured me that i was the only one to complain but clearly there have been issues before and the excuses paltry ,the receptionist told me at one point there were too many people trying to access at once.... give me a break! The room is stylish and beds are comfy but it is a very noisy location with a temple next door chiming prayers early in the morning, lots of traffic noise and rubbish collection at 2am kept me awake each night. I can only guess that those who reviewed in the press that the hotel are proud of were staying in the suites at the back of the hotel with less noise. I know that is is converted building in a conservation area so space is limited but the website could be more realistic about size of rooms. Overall I'd say if you are a leisure traveller who is on a budget and won't be in your room much then go for it.

The superior double room is very small, but fine for a solo traveller. I think it would be a tight squeeze for a couple though. Bathroom is a wet room with shower and toilet enclosed in glass walls. TV is a small LCD screen with limited channels. The best part of the room is the bed; very comfy and high-quality linens. Other than the size of the room, the major caveat is noise. The street outside of the hotel is noisy at night with revellers. I did stay on Friday and Saturday nights though, so I can't say what the conditions are on weeknights.

I can't imagine being in that room with a second person, especially with the tiny glassed in toilet/shower (No, not a toilet in the same room as the shower -- a toliet under the shower head in a glass box about 2ft in length and width. At least the ceilings are a normal height). Still, free internet and a small fridge in a nice section of the city. 5 minutes from the MRT and an adequate hawker stand. Clean room, OK breakfast (but free, so I can't complain). Polite people at the desk. Overall, it's possible to spend a little more for a lot better room and location, but if you plan on only dropping in to sleep it's certainly clean and cheaper than most everything else (especially now).", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly fine for a short business trip\u201d", "Author": "ervingara", "ReviewID": "UR13479387", "Content": "I spent three nights here in January 2008, due to unavailability of rooms elsewhere.

This was unlike a staff of another hotel nearby who was very rude when I inquired over the phone. My reservation conservation came immediately and there was daily email from the staff with regards to our booking. We arrived on a midnight so we requested for a limousine service. Unfortunately the limousine driver missed us because our flight was delayed and there was a long queue at the immigration. The staff were very accomodating in resolving this problem. Our room was small by standards but it was cozy. There is a water heater for bath, a small ref, internet connection, television, hairdryer, water heater, aircondition. Sheets were changed daily. There was a welcome note and chocolates from the General Manager and the Asst Manager for Concierge. We were able to sleep soundly, not distrurbed by the noise outside - this despite our room location (at the street corner).

I had to use my laptop when I'm on the bed since the desk is quite small for the laptop. The plus thing here is the free internet access. What I didn't like was the sour-faced auntie who confronted me on my last day. There was a problem with the air conditioner on my last night and when I asked the front desk staff to check it, she said there's something wrong with it. So she upgraded me at no extra cost to their deluxe double room (which was a bit larger than the superior single room). The next day when I was about to check-out, the auntie (cleaning lady) told me that there's nothing wrong with their air conditioner since she checks it every morning. She told me that I didn't press the remote control hard enough. But I just shrugged it off and told her that even the front desk staff member can't get it to work.

(ii) The uncle/security guard (I think he is in his 60s) who is working at the carpark behind the hotel highlighted to us that the exit door to the carpark would be shut after 11pm, so we had to leave from the front door.

The staff was very helpful and nice and free soft drinks were provided in the room. So far so good. Upon arrival I asked myself why there was a tiny musical clock in the room. Soon I found out: One corner of our already very small room was designated as \"bathroom\" meaning that behind a glass wall there was a shower and toilet. The glass wall was partly frosted; just enough to allow a minimum of sanitary privacy. But no way to block any sounds... Well, time for the musical clock! Unfortunately the breakfast was a joke. Our eggs came along with some baked beans, greasy bacon and rubberlike potato wedges, the \"buffet\" consisted only of prepacked jam and butter plus toast.

I wanted some different than the generic chains seen throughout Singapore--and got it! It was a fun place to stay, with a GREAT location, and good service. However, if you're looking for the usual perks of a major chain--large rooms, a gym, quiet, etc., then you might want to look elsewhere.", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat for young people on a stopover\u201d", "Author": "Mazworldtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR4729679", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for two nights. Yes the rooms are very very small. But they are new, modern, quirky, comfortable and clean. The jacuzzi was nice and we sat there everyday for a brief moment. Staff were flexible and the lady at breakfast was amazing- She remembered how everyone likes their eggs. We liked this place and would go back there but ask for a larger room. Definitly worth a try if you are young, travelling light and like attention to detail and contemporary design.", "Date": "March 24, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel 1929", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d306179-Reviews-Hotel_1929-Singapore.html", "Price": "$129 - $205*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">50 Keong Saik Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">089154</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "306179", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/dc/72/dc72ec637d68dbb64a67c544699547796large.jpg"}}
