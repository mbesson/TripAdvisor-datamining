The location of the hotel is excellent - it is located within 2 blocks of two metro stations and is literally 2 blocks away from Boulevard St. Germain. There are lots of cafes, restaurants and shops (boutique and brand names) all within walking distance to the hotel. We shopped and walked back to the hotel to drop off our shopping bags before continuing on with our day which was really helpful, especially since we were right in the middle of the winter sales. The complimentary breakfast was a nice touch - you get a glass of orange juice, coffee, croissants, yogurt, cheese and fruits. However, the hotel was not without any disappointments. Firstly, the free wi-fi did not work 2 days out of the 3 we spent at the hotel. There is a complimentary computer that you can use for free in the lobby but we needed to access wi-fi to use Skype to call home. Secondly, the Classic Double Room that we got was very small even for European standards. It was literally a room with a bed and not much else but the room was very clean. Thirdly, even though the hotel is non-smoking, there were guests in other rooms who were smoking and the air drifted into our room at night which was very unpleasant. There is a fine of 68 euros for smoking inside the hotel but we did not bother reporting it to the hotel attendant because we were too tired by the end of the night to do so. The hotel staff was very polite and helpful - not very warm and fuzzy but took care of anything we asked for, including hiring a car to drive us to the airport. Here is my advice for those considering this hotel: 1. Consider booking the rooms directly from the hotel's website rather than through another website. We found the hotel's rate to be at least 20 euros cheaper than others. 2. If you order a taxi through the hotel to drive you to the airport, there is a surcharge that applies for calling the taxi. When we got settled into our taxi, the meter was already at 9.50 euros because the meter starts when the taxi is called. There is a taxi stand nearby but we never saw any taxis waiting at the stand during our entire stay. 3. Take earplugs if you choose not to book a Superior Double Room. The Classic Double Rooms face the street or the courtyard (we got the courtyard facing room which was nice because it was super quiet) so if you get a room facing the street, the noise volume will be loud from the people on the street spilling out from the bars and restaurants. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to those who are looking for a centrally located hotel that is clean and affordable.", "Date": "February 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel with charming staff and great location\u201d", "Author": "OaklandSandy", "ReviewID": "UR93800605", "Content": "We stayed seven nights and enjoyed our stay immensely!

The hotel staff is helpful, responsive and exceptionally friendly and treat you like a guest in their home rather than just someone who booked a hotel room.

You'll also find conveniently located ATM's a block away. Many good restaurants (cafes, bistros) are nearby, and the hotel staff is happy to assist in making recommendations or reservations.

You don't have to give up anything for this conveniently located quiet hotel in the midst of all that Paris has to offer. The hotel itself is charming. A small lobby opens to a comfortable bar and beyond that, a glass covered dining area where a European breakfast is served to guests each morning--wonderful French rolls, butter, brie, thinly sliced ham and cheese, fresh fruit, milk, juice, yogurt, assorted cereals, and of course, cafe au lait and croissants. The dining area opens to an outdoor courtyard in good weather, but we were there during this spring's cool spell. The hotel is fully air conditioned, has elevators, modern bathrooms including hair dryers, room safes in each room. The rooms vary in size. Each floor has 7 rooms: 3 singles opening onto the courtyard, 2 doubles above the street side, and 2 larger doubles/king overlooking the courtyard along the side. We had one of these, Room #11. It was small, as all european hotel rooms seem to traveling Americans, but more than adequate. There was ample storage for our week's worth of clothes (shelves and hanging space in the closet), and we were able to stow our rollaboards above the closet.

TV and telephone in room, and you will be provided with the password for their \"Meteor\" wifi when you check in. If you don't bring your own computer or internet capable phone, the hotel has a computer and printer available to guests in an alcove near the breakfast area. All of the staff were friendly, capable, and fluent in English. We paid 182 euros per night, which included breakfast each morning (typically valued at 13 euros per person).

The few extra days turned out to 6 extra days. We could not have wished for a better place to wait out the\"fallout\", forgive the pun. This hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in in Paris, and I've stayed in a few. It's not the cheapest but it is not the most expensive. The hotel is situated slap bang in the middle of St Germain with a myriad of restautants and cafes quite literally on the doorstep. For the ladies there is an enormous array of shopping possibilities, from the local boutique shops in the small streets of St Germain to Le Bon Marche, the very upmarket shopping centre no more than 10 minutes stroll away. The hotel itself is tucked away on Rue de Canettes, a very narrow street with St Sulpice at the bottom. Once trhough the doors you will be surprised at the spaciousness of the hotel and the very warm and friendly greeting, in English, in fact one of the guys on the desk is from Glasgow. The rooms are very comfortable....if you want to swing a cat you'll probably have to go to a more expensive and less well located hotel. But if you are happy with bright, cosy and quiet then you are fine.

Our previous two visits to this hotel were in rooms facing out onto the street below. The street is very busy with more pedestrians than traffic ( a very narrow one-way street); and at night becomes even more busy when the many bars and restaurants/bistros open their doors. The very early morning street cleaners, and refuse collections/delivery vans make sure that you wake very early, and if you have been kept awake for most of the night with the revellers, then this does not make for a welcome wake-up call. Our recent visit, however, was in room 01; a ground floor (the only ground floor bedroom) superior room. At first we thought \"great\" - a good peaceful night's sleep, in a good-sized (by Parisienne standards) room. The decor was ok - although could do with a spruce up. Being on the groundfloor, the room had french doors opening out onto the decking area which is open to all guests (their entrance to the decking area would be via the breakfast room (conservatory). Unlike any of the other rooms (and indeed uncommon with most hotel rooms) our room had a bathroom window ( a rather large, frosted glass window). We assured ourselves that the window would be non-see through given it's frosting. Oh dear how wrong could we be!! At breakfast the first morning, we were seated facing the conservatory windows, looking out onto the decking, and onto our room's french doors, and the bathroom window. To our shock and horror, we had left the bathroom light on, and every little detail was visible to everyone in the breakfast room. The next most troubling issue we had with room, is that all the rooms above ours seemed to have their toilet pipes going through our room, behind a boxed area on the wall. Each time a toilet was flushed, we were awoken throughout the night (6 floors with at least 2 rooms per floor made for many toilet flushes!! There was also a low rumbling until the early hours; we discovered this was the metro running beneath the hotel (obviously we had not noticed this on our previous visits being on the higher floors). Another point about room 01 is quite a sensitive issue - if you are planning on having a typical romantic break in the city of 'love', then do not have room 01. The room is equipped for disabled guests (a walk-in shower; a commode in the bathroom; and 2 single beds pushed together but certainly not a double bed - the gap in between makes it impossible to get close to close to your sleeping partner!), and the beds have buttons to raise and lower the head/foot to make it easier to get our of the bed. All of these issues make the room very unromantic and a total turn-off - so something to be aware of, or indeed beware off. We emailed ahead and asked for the hotel to arrange an airport collection for us. This cost 90 euros (CDG to hotel in a VW people carrier). We got a taxi back to CDG at the end of our stay, cost was 61 euros ( a Mercedes people carrier). So you would better off booking a taxi. The staff were ok - I would say they were no friendlier than a shop assistant in the many shops we visited; and certainly could have been more hospitable given their profession. Breakfast on the Sunday was very busy, and I would say that the hotel is a stop-off for many french people who come to the city for shopping/entertainment at the weekend. However, they sit at the very few breakfast tables, reading their newspapers, whilst other guests have to wait for a table to have breakfast. We wanted a longer stay in Paris than just a couple of days, so chose this hotel over our absolute favourite, but very expensive, Hotel de Crillon. The entire stay at Hotel le Perle would have one night at the de Crillon. But in future, we will stay fewer nights in Paris and enjoy the luxury and attention to every detail, and absolute perfection of the de Crillon, rather than subject ourselves to many nights of no or broken sleep in a room that would be better off in a hospital. One last thing - the shower lacks power and is very difficult to wash hair in (especially if you have longer hair), it is no more than trickle. If you do get this room, try putting up bath towels around the bathroom window to give you privacy and not be the hotel entertainment.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "niter\u00c3\u00b3i, brasil", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel.\u201d", "Author": "tricolor00", "ReviewID": "UR48619329", "Content": "Excelent location.

The hotel is very central to all Left Bank sights plus it is easily accessible to all of Paris with the metro stations closeby. It is located in a very quiet laneway which is essential for a quiet night's sleep. The hotel room was very clean with very comfortable beds and a modern, clean bathroom, that was a decent size. It has all you need, except an iron (however you can use their laundry room). The doonas were quite hot for summer though! As other's say the room is small by Australian/American standards but as everybody says, you're never in it except to sleep, so as long as you have hot water, a comfortable bed and airconditioning to come back to, with the assurance of cleanliness, what more do you need. Hotel breakfast room was airy and bright and a lovely place to plan your day. Breakfast was continental style and delicious, probably pricier than outside the hotel but you just do what suits you at the time. We didn't eat there every morning. There were also wonderful creperies located in the same street as well as various restaurants/cafes nearby. While I think of it, there were also wonderful shops nearby. Just walk around and explore - it's very rewarding. I would easily stay there again, but only if the price was not too extreme, as it can be pricey at certain times of the year. When I went (post Bastille Day,July 2007) it was low season. As an extra note, we felt safe travelling around Paris at all times, whether it was morning, evening around the main sights or even midnight up at the Trocadero watching the Tower lit up. We used metro everywhere and at anytime. The metro is very easy to use. Buy 'une carnet' of tickets at a time (ie 10 tickets) as it's cheaper than buying 10 individually. Don't even consider buying daily/combo tourist passes as they're more expensive. Also if you're sightseeing you definately need to buy a museum pass (3, 4 and 7 day passes from memory) They are well worth the money. I've only been to Paris twice, but bought them both times (I think I bought 4 day passes each time). Bonus is Children are free for enty to most musems until they are 18! Also you don't have to queue up in the long lines, you go to special entrances. One final recommendation is to buy the Rick Steve's guidebook for Paris or anywhere. They tell you all you need to know. I wont even try to explain, but my sisters and I always buy them for all our travels. We must own most of his European city and country books! And by the way, while we think they're written for inexperienced travellers and mainly an American market, they have a wealth of hand's on information.

Plenty of hangers. - Bathroom- clean with good water pressure, clothesline, tub and shower. - Locked storage area for luggage- we were very surprised that almost every other hotel we stayed at in Europe did not have a locked area for us to store our luggage before check-in/after check-out. Negatives about the hotel: - Our room wasn't ready at the stated check-in time. This was annoying because we had arrived in Paris at 9am after an overnight flight and really wanted to freshen up.

Once we had got her attention she was very brisk with us and told us we had to wait 10 minutes. Once we got our keys and opened the door to our room we were extremely disappointed to find we had been put at the back of the hotel in a very small dark room that was not at all inviting or expected for the 170 euro cost. We immediately went down stairs to complain about the room and asked if we could be moved, we could not have one of the front rooms like last time as they were all full, therefore we took an upgrade to the only other available room at an extra 50 euros per night. It made the room very expensive however it was a big improvement.

Hotel staff was VERY helpful and accommodating. The breakfast buffet looked quite complete and ran the typical hotel cost for the continental breakfast (we didn't eat there.) The location is fabulous... it is on a set of small one way streets that are more pedestrian than auto ready... and they're full of little bistros and restaurants, small boutiques and an english language bookstore. Our room was big for Paris and neither of us spent time crawling between the walls/desk/closets and bed to get around. Beyond the immediate location, the hotel is about 2 blocks from two different metro lines, close to two movie theaters, and not that far from the Luxembourg gardens.

The location was perfect & really gave us the feeling of being in Paris - quaint street (limited car access) with many wonderful cafes & shops to choose from. Also great access to the metro bus & subway lines. We found the staff to be very, very accommodating, the room highly adequate (altho not large by U.S. standards), very comfortable beds & bedding and overall excellent service. One tip - ask for the upgrade to superior room so it will be on the inner court. Our room was on the 5th floor over the inner court & was exceptionally quiet - but we overheard other guests saying their room on the hotel front was noisy in the evenings due to people in the cafes across the street. If we get to go to Paris again, we will definitely stay at the LaPerle. We arrived very early from our U.S. flight (7:30 a.m.) and didn't expect to be able to do anything other than store our luggage until later in the day, but they welcomed us warmly, invited us to partake of their breakfast, fixed us much-needed coffee, & had us in our room within an hour! Also, their recommendations for restaurants, etc. were great. They even went out of the way to mail us a scarf we had inadvertently left when we checked out.

We speak no French at all and were concerned after hearing so many stories about the rude French. Much to our delight we found that NOT to be the case at all. The staff went out of thier way to make arrangements for us with care. The location of the hotel is on a small side street, almost the size of an alley.

It's located on a very quaint street with boutiques, restaurants, pubs and creperies. On a side note, there is a wonderful little Italian pizza place across the street from the hotel (Pizza Positano) that serves authentic Neapolitan pizza nd pasta. Delicious! We ate there twice. Good shopping in the surrounding areas and walking distance to many key sights. About a 15 min. walk to Notre Dame and 5-10 min. walk to Luxembourg Gardens, St. Sulpice, etc. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Our only complaint would be that the walls are very, very thin and you can hear everything going on in the hallways or in the room next to you. You can't hear any street noise from the room which is quite nice but we were woken up fairly early (6 or 7 a.m.) on several mornings either by the guests in the next room or by maids cleaning, couldn't quite tell.

Pros: Absolutely fantastic location, within a 10 min walk of 3 metro lines, great restaurants/bars/cafes, shopping, 20 mins to major museums & the right bank. Room was of decent size & kept very clean, no smoking odors. Most of staff helpful & friendly. Quick check-in/out procedure. Cons: Unprofessional staff behavior - when I arrived, the cleaning staff were having a huge screaming row downstairs, which could be clearly heard throughout the lobby. This continued for 30 mins; no one did anything to stop it. The staff (I never ate here but the guest computer is right next to the breakfast room) simply threw the silverware into the cutlery trays every morning, making an awful noise. The walls of my room were so thin I could hear every guest on my floor coming & going. The shower pressure was so weak as to be laughable, & the temperature fluctuations were painful. My minibar was only refilled 3 out of the 5 days (I was almost never in the room). The guest computer didn't work well & there was no printer, which was inconvenient. Overall the place just seemed a bit shabby & poorly managed, which is enough to put me off staying there again.

There are some excellent restaurants in the vicinity if you don't want to venture far, but, as well as location, this hotel has the benefit of friendly staff and very clean, comfortable rooms. This is Paris, so don't expect a room the size of a ballroom...however, we had a small double room which was big enough for two people. The green curtains and green bathroom were slighly outdated, but as mentioned before, spotlessly clean and the water pressure was better than in some 5* hotels I've stayed in!
