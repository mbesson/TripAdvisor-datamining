Our family room 203 was always warm during all our living, even if outside was snow storm every day. I do not know why but we had no shower gel in our bathroom on a first day. We asked at reception and got a new big bottle with a nice flower aroma (special for us :) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c personally thanks to Mr. Z\u00c3\u00bclkuf.

They clearly aim to please. The hotel is steps away from Istanbul's key attractions - the Aya Sofya, the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace - and the tram to the new city and the Bosphorus runs right outside. I loved the quaint sound of the tram bell as it passed below my windows. That said, the windows, when closed, let in remarkably little noise. The Faros offered a free airport transfer included in the room price if you book through their website and how wonderful it was to see the driver patiently waiting for me when I exited Ataturk airport! While the location is incredibly convenient, it is in a bustling neighborhood filled with tourists, which is not for everyone. And do not expect an expansive lobby, suitable for lounging at the Faros.

You can not hear anything from outside the hotel- great sound proofing, however we could hear what was going on in the hotel coridoors- we didnt mind though. We were not disturbed and our room was cleaned what ever time we left the hotel for the day- and that could be well in to the afternoon. Did put a DO not disturb sign- which was obviously noted by staff - have stayed in some hotels where they try to barge in anyway!) Fresh towels everyday and I am a clean freak and noticed surfaces had been wiped down and cleaned. There is a good hair dryer in the room as I am always wary of hairdryers being to weak for my thick hair (in case you lug one in your suitcase as I did)- you really wont need to. Lovely touches in the room with cotton wool, earbuds and even complimentary bottled water- everyday! there was no dressing gown as stated :( but there were slippers. We only managed to get up for breakfast once- which was unfortunate as it was soooo yummy. Choices of a usual turkish breakfast, with added dried fruits, yoghurts, cereals, cheeses, cold meats, bread, butter, boiled eggs, Gozleme (turkish pancake) etc plus hot drinks made freshly- not out of a machine. Staff at the hotel were so helpful with advice on how to get about and even had umbrella's on hand when we needed to go out in the rain. You can order food in to the hotel through their sister restuarant- we didnt do this, just visited the restuarant. No cashpoints at hotel from what I could see- Taksim was literally a 2-3 minute walk away and I would say Taksim is in general a very good place to stay and you can access most places from here.

Unfortunately, due to roof repairs scheduled for the next few days, the staff informed us that we would have to change rooms and they moved our bags down to a standard room on the top floor, overlooking the restaurants in the narrow lane at the side of the hotel. The wonderful food aromas wafting from this lane, were amazing! The room was clean with comfortable beds. The only negative that we found? There is no bathtub and the corner shower is very tiny. I don't know how a larger person would maneuver in this sized shower (NOTE: the shower in the \"glass room\" on the roof was larger). The hotel staff was amazing. Every request that we presented was met with the response \"Immediately\", and it was an immediate response. The restaurant staff was friendly, even providing a free turkish liqueur after supper. The breakfast buffet was included in our package and was tasty with good option choices. Excellent yogurt and fresh fruits. It must be noted here that due to religious beliefs, there is no pork in Turkey. The Turkish food is the best that I have ever eaten. We tried different dishes every meal and every one was fantastic...beef, lamb, chicken, etc. I still miss their food! The pastries are unbelievable! If you are a wine drinker, I highly recommend a particularly fine white wine called Kankoy...blissful! The hotel is in a great area for sightseeing and shopping.

The internet rate was good and included return transfers to/fro airport which was very handy.

The hotel is on Divan Yolu right on the tram line opposite the Blue Mosque and Aga Sofya so its well positioned for taking in all the sights. Request a room at the back if you are a light sleeper as front rooms can hear the rambling of the trams as they pass right in front. We got upgraded to a bigger room as we stayed for 6 nights and the staff were helpful and very pleasant. Room was sufficient and although not 5star luxury and designer chic.....it had everything you could ask for. Large free bottle of mineral water daily, kettle and coffe/tea in room plus all the toiletries although toothbrush not provided but then no hotels in Europe provide this. Breakfast was fine and one can ask for apple tea or peppermint tea besides the usual chai they serve. You can also request for them to cook your eggs fresh even though they have scrambled eggs on the hot plate. Fresh fruits yoghutr cereal all there so it was a decent spread. You also get a 10|% discount when dining at their restaurant which is was fairly decent food. There was always a nice crowd dining there and prices are reasonable. The only downside I canthink of is that the beds are a little soft and lumpy but not so ucomfortable that it ruined my sleep.........I still slept very well each night. Enjoyed our stay but in retrospect i think i would select a hotel in Taksim area as there is much more to do there in evenings. Better variety of restaurants and nightlife.

We had both wanted to travel to Turkey for awhile, but as my husband is in the military and recently returned from Iraq he was a little hesitant. After finding this hotel and several tours, he allowed us to go. I booked the hotel through Expedia and paid for everything up front. The Sunday before the trip I called the hotel to confirm and set up an airprot pick-up. Plans and room were confirmed along with a point of contact. When we arrived at the airport, there was no one from the hotel to pick us up. I called the hotel and they told me I woud have to take a taxi because it was so late, 2300. We arrived at the hotel and were told that our room had been given to someone else and that we could only stay one night because the hotel was full. I showed the desk clerk my reservation, confirmation and receipt and was promptly informed that they didn't honor bookings from Expedia. Because it was so late, we paid the fee again for the hotel. The next morning we met with the manager and he told us there wasn't a room in the hotel for the rest of our stay and all the hotels in the city were booked because of the IMF conference. The manager's aid took us to a travel agent to try find a room. We wound up taking a trip to Kusadasi and Ephesus since there were no available rooms! While in Kusadasi my husband and I tried to find out about having the room we had already paid for ready when we returned to Istanbul. We both received confirmation and a confirmation number saying we would have a room when we returned. We arrived back at the hotel after 2300 to be told that there was no room and that we would have to find lodging else where. I reminded him that we had already paid and was told it didn't matter. We were then told to leave the hotel. This was after midnight. The manager didn't care that we had no place to go and that I was a lone woman in a large city with an 11 yo boy in the middle of the night. I have to admit that I was terrified. After gathering my witts, we found a travel agent that was still open and he found us a room at the Sheraton. This was an amazing hotel and I would stay there again. After returning home, I found out that the hotel sent a bill to Expedia for the stay that I never was able to use. Because of the unscrupulous manager, we had to pay an additional $1750 for our trip and I have not received a refund from either the hotel or Expedia. I don't know where the disconnect came from with our stay and it may just have been someone wanting to get more money for the room, but this was not a good thing to go through. We made the best of the situation (trip to Kusadasi and Ephesus), but the issue with the hotel really put a damper on our fun and my husband won't let us travel back there again.

After reading several reviews at Trip Advisor, I decided to book a double room at Hotel Faros. The surprise was that when I arrived to the hotel, the hotel manager welcomed us apologising that there was a problem and our reservation had not been made, even if I had received an e-mail confirmation. I was really upset. However, I have to recognise that the hotel manager did his best to solve the trouble in a professional way. First, he organised for us to stay in another hotel, two minutes walk from Faros (and I would say, a much better hotel). Second, we got a one night free of charge. So, they made a mistake but at least they reacted very professionally. Must admit it. Now, speaking about the hotel itself, in my opinion it is an average 3 stars urban type small hotel. To highlight something, the location is excellent (2 minutes walk to the Blue mosque) and that the staff was in general kind and helpful. The hotel is clean and the rooms are quite new.

I had a corner suite for 79 Euros (regular rooms were 60 Euros), which was spacious and clean. (At checkout the bill was in Turkish Lira, not Euros.) They arrange a private driver from the airport for stays of 2 nights or more (most hotels do this and I recommend it). There is some daytime noise since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located on the Divan Yolu (tram runs on this street), but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a light sleeper and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me at all. However you will hear the morning call to prayer (5-6am) via loudspeakers, regardless of where you stay in this area since there are over 2,000 mosques in Istanbul. There are some restaurants on the side street adjacent to the hotel which close by midnight, but I was up late so I never heard any noise. Location-wise, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re perfectly located on the main street between the Grand Bazaar (walking 10 mins), Blue Mosque (5 mins), Aya Sofia (7-10 mins), and 2 minutes from the Sultanahmet tram stop, plus it's located next to the Starbucks and McDonald's for easy landmarks. (The tram is $1 and convenient to almost any site in Istanbul, and connects to the funicular to Istiklal Street across the Bosphorous). The Faros is a nice, upscale hotel in a great location. The front desk staff and restaurant/bar staff were all extremely nice and helpfull. Hotel offers wi-fi for the internet, or you can use their laptop in the lobby to check your email, which was great as I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to carry my laptop halfway around the world. The included breakfast was good and offered a large buffet featuring a Mediterranean breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcheeses, meats, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, plus scrambled eggs, cereals, breads, coffee, tea, etc. There are flatscreen tv's (English news) so you can catch up on world news. My only complaint was that after traveling 18 hours through 3 airports, I arrived (they knew I was a woman traveling solo), and my room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available due to some airport weather cancellations. They offered me a room located by itself on the roof, accessible by going out a door on the top floor, and up a spiral staircase to the roof. I did not want to stay isolated in this location by myself in a foreign country, and the manager was annoyed that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comfortable with the option, even suggesting that if I didn't like his offer I should find a new hotel for the remainder of my trip! They made arrangements for me to stay at the Amisos hotel for one night (loud due location over an English pub), but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer to give me a discount or other option to accommodate me. On a 3.5-day trip, it was a major disruption to my schedule, as I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check in until 1pm the next day and it cut directly into a scheduled tour that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d made for that morning. That was my only complaint about the Faros. Once I did get checked into the Faros, my experience was was excellent and I would stay here again. I recommend 3 restaurants near the hotel: 1) Amedros (Divanyolu hoca Rustem Sk. No. 7)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlocated on side street next to Faros. Great staff, delicious lamb, and meze appetizers (rated No. 1 on Trip Advisor). 2) Mozaik & Rumelli \u00e2\u20ac\u201c located 2-3 blocks on side street off of Divan Yolu (Divanyolu Caddesi Ticarethane). Outdoor seating, or sit upstairs which we did (there are several small rooms with fireplaces and 3-4 tables in each room). Good Turkish food and ambience. 3) Adonin Cafe (Located across from Mozaik & Rumelli on Divanyolu Caddesi Ticarethane sokak no:27/31) www.adonincafe.com Again, we enjoyed excellent Turkish cuisine, including the best lentil soup I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had, and Turkish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ravioli\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a lamb sauce. The service was excellent, and the staff were so friendly to our international mix of diners from Australia and Chicago.

We did a two day trip to Galipoli and Troy and i was pleased that the hotel was prepared to securley lock up our suitcases for us to retrieve later. The chef who cooked the Morning breakfast was anxious to please and although basic was quite well prepared.

Breakfast was fine and plentiful - it was provided in the bar downstairs and beers in the bar were reasonably priced for Istanbul. The front desk were useless. They couldn't provide any information on getting around the city etc etc and dealt with a major issue we had with our room totally unsatisfactorily. The glass shower screen in our room came off its hinges and shattered over both of us, showering us in tiny shards of glass but causing thankfully only minor cuts. This happened one morning before breakfast and we reported it to reception who were slow to respond. They did not offer us an alternative room to use or show any concern given the damage it had caused, which was very poor service.

You can get a taxi to the hotel from the airport for about \u00c2\u00a312. Quite a journey. About 50 mph, 5 feet from the back of the car in front. Almost as good as a rollercoaster ride. Alternatively, you can get the Metro and change to the tram (1.30 Turkish Lira each) and get off the tram at Sultanahmet station. The hotel is about 200 yards away, back the way you have just come on the tram, on the right. Breakfast is juice, coffee, egg and sausage, cereal, dried fruit, fruit, bread, croissant, cheese,, cold meat etc. and great for a few days. The Sultanahmet area is very touristy and there are loads of restaurants in the area. You will be pestered all day by people trying to get you in their bar or restaurant for coffee or a meal. We found all the restaurants pretty mediocre. The main sites are really worth seeing. If you hoped to see the Turkish east meets west, you are about twenty years too late. The whole of Istanbul is pretty westernised now and quite expensive. Eating out is not cheap. Food is a bit cheaper than England but alcohol is expensive. Beer \u00c2\u00a34.50 a pint and wine is \u00c2\u00a315-20 a bottle. If you go over to the Golden Horn and Beyoglu there is more night life and the restaurants are better. It is even more westernised though. The main street could be any British High Street, with Top Shop, Gap, three Starbucks, two McDonalds and a Burger King. Try one of the restaurants at the bottom of the main street, Istiklal Caddesi. Turn off right just after the Swedish Embassy. Try meze as a starter, followed by fish, but don't expect any change from 100 TL and it will be more if you have wine. To get to the horn from Sultanahmet, jump on the tram and get off at Tophane and then just keep walking up the hill to the top.
