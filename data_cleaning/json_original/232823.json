{"Reviews": [{"Content": "so convenient We hadn't researched hotels in Madrid and were booked into this by the travel centre at the train station. If you are looking for character, don't stay here. It is a modern hotel with a view from our room into the elevator shaft. However, we found Negresco to be very clean, with attractive spacious rooms, big comfortable bed and very friendly staff. The bathroom was very clean and modern. There was also a good TV with many channels (sky etc). The location is very central and felt very safe. The breakfast was extra cost at 5.35 euros and was good value, but the poor coffee forced us to look elsewhere for breakfast. We loved the provision of a tea/coffee machine that guests could use at any time and also free, very available, internet. Beware, first floor rooms are smokers rooms.", "Date": "Nov 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR637112158", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gypsymelbourne"}, {"Content": "pleasant stay, good location I booked this hotel based on trip adviser reviews as I normally go by them. Definitely not all disappointed. The hotel has a very good location just off the Grand Via. I originally tried the Best Western Atlantico as rated number 1 but couldn't get in but this is a stones throw away from there.The hotel is a 3 star. Staff were fine and helpful. It is true what other reviews say the lift is tiny but it works.The rooms are clean and they are a typical size. The decor is dated but it really didn't bother me.If you are looking for a good base to explore the city then this hotel is perfect. Its clean with good rates.Breakfast we went out for ,as its so much cheaper. There is a lovely Tapas bar in front of the hotel for a good evening meal.Getting to and from the airport is easy.The cheapest way is by underground. 2 euros each way but if you have loads of bags its a good workout with the stairs. We did book a transfer with expedia which was \u62e212 each one way. Just turning up and getting a taxi can be the most expensive approx 40 euros.Madrid itself is a beautiful city and worth a trip.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR190497410", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "vickyb1"}, {"Content": "Locatiion fab, staff indifferent This hotel is an ideal loaction for exploring. It's just set back from the Grand Via and very close to the metro, tourist bus service and many of the sights. My sister and I shared a small room at the front of the hotel which was adaquate for our needs as it only served as a base and a place to lay our haeds after exploring the city.On arrival the girl on reception barely acknowledged our existence and this continued pretty much throughout our stay. I do not expect everyone to speak English but we found we were treated with complete indifference for the duration of our stay (3 nights). Breakfast was very simple and we were only given 2/3 sweet croissants with a choice of toast if required. Juice  coffee were provided.Location wise this hotel was perfect but we were left feeling very unwelcome by the staff.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR468481400", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Twig38"}, {"Content": "Location Location Location This hotel is absolutely perfect for that long weekend away. It is literally off the Grand Via (the main shopping strip) but is double glazed and air conditioned so no noise and no worries about the heat! The staff are smiley and always their to help. We didnt try the breakfast (5euros) becuase you can get it cheaper elsewhere but the free interent and coffee in the mornings was a bonus. We had an exterior room which was great . the shower was amazing - a real power shower and the room was more than big enough for 2 people. I have no experience of the interior, smaller rooms but if the aircon works and the bed is comfy i wouldn't worry myself, you only sleep in the room anyway!Madrid itself isa great city, Beautiful parks and buildings, the palace is amazing. Dont be fooled by the maps ...it is not as big as they make out. what looks like a long trek on the map is actually only a short walk...on all maps bizarely.if you need to get to the outskirts ie airport, Real Madrid Stadium...take the train. it is so easy to use and airconditioned. Buy a 10 journey pass for (6.40euros, or single journey for 1 euro)For the kids the adventure park in the big park is great fun and can be reached from the bottom of the cable car. This cable car goes right accross the city and has amazing views (3euros each). definately worth it.My only gripe is that if you are on a budget food is not good. They dont seem to take a lot of pride in their food or service of it unless youa re paying more money. But follow thier lead..order lots of little things and share, its not like the UK where everyone has a meal to themselves - its tapas country after all!Watch out for small kids being overfriendly - one tried to have my wallet but i caught him. Take a book with some pre-written phrases. Madrid is not like France or anywhere else ive been - do not ever expect anyone to speak english. we were their for 4 days and spoke to 2 people who could speak english. We should be maiking the effort anyway.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR860816106", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jgarfield"}, {"Content": "Clean and central. This hotel is centrally situated in Madrid close to shops and restaurants and within easy walking distance of all major tourist attractions.Rooms are of two types -- interior and exterior. The former face onto a tiny light well at the rear of the building, while the latter have windows onto the street. The interior rooms are really very small indeed, have no light coming in through the frosted windows, and smell of cooking breakfast in the morning. The exterior rooms are larger, contain more furniture, and are much lighter and brighter. If you are a mole you might prefer the interior room; if you are a human who enjoys daylight I would certainly recommend that you go for an exterior room. However, I emailed the hotel several weeks before my arrival to ask for an exterior room but my request was ignored. After staying in a dungeon-like interior room for one night I was fortunately able to move to one that faced the street. Noise from outside is not a problem as the windows are double-glazed. However, noise from inside the hotel is very significant as the walls seem to be made of cardboard. It is possible to hear EVERY word from the room next door (this is no exaggeration).The rooms are not huge, and two people with a lot of luggage might find them a bit of a squeeze. However, they are very clean, bedding is spotless, and the bathroom is well appointed with a very powerful shower and also a bidet.Staff at reception are very helpful and friendly, offering advice, making 'phone calls for guests, or simply chatting with guests (I am a bi-lingual speaker of English and Spanish, however, so perhaps this facilitated communication).This is a fair place to stay if you need a room in a three-star hotel in central Madrid. However, I've stayed in other places nearby (all full due to the Spanish holiday for 1st May) and they have much bigger rooms, wooden floors (instead of carpet, the hygiene of which is always suspect), and bathtubs, and are cheaper, so in general I would stay in them in preference to the Negresco.The breakfast seemed a bit overpriced for a continental breakfast -- the Hotel Dos Castillas, the Cafeteria Zahara, Cafeteria Ovni, etc. -- all nearby -- usually do a deal for under three Euros, or under two Euros if you don't take the orange juice.", "Date": "May 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR683303481", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Quentin1"}, {"Content": "Fine Hotel, great location Located close to the very heart of Madrid.

It is just a short stroll away from the Plaza Mayor and everything in Madrid is a short walk away from the Plaza Mayor.The staff however are very rude and you must deal with them everytime you enter or leave the hotel. They are arrogant and look down on you if they give you any attention at all. They DO speak English perfectly, but they refuse to. We didn't find this out until we left for a quick breakfast at 10:00 and our checkout time was noon. She acted more annoyed than usual and said You DO know you're leaving in 2 hours? The day we arrived I lugged two large suitcases up 3 flights of stairs and the desk person never told us there was an elevator hidden in the corner.

We found a fantastic deal through Expedia and 2 days later we were on a plane on our way to Madrid.Our deal included the Partner Negresco Hotel and I couldn't have wished for better.The Negresco is a small hotel and was fully booked every day that we were there. But its definately worth trying to get in there. Its in a fabulous central location which made walking around easy with a 4 year old.The room was very clean, tidy and fresh. Most people 'borrow' the bath robes from hotels but if it was possible I would have packed the shower and taken it home with me!The staff were always very friendly and helpful and adored my daughter. There is also a free internet terminal in reception so they helped keep her entertained while I checked my email.The only fault I could find was that the walls aren't particularly sound proof so if you're a light sleeper take some earplugs (I think our neighbours must have been doing some DIY so maybe it was just bad timing on my part).Madrid is a very lovely city with loads of shopping, walking and fountains galore! Having a little one with me we took advantage of the MadridVision tourist bus which at 10.60 Euros was a life saver for us. There are 3 routes with the usual hop on hop off function. All in all we had a great time and would definately recommend staying at the Negresco.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR666451553", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Very impressed My partner and I booked a three night stay at this hotel in October 2004 through Expedia. We were very impressed.The Negresco is a small hotel with an excellent location: between the Gran Via and Sol and close to the nightlife of Chueca. When a stroll across town in the 30 degree heat became a little too much, the cheap underground system was easy to use (buy a ten-journey shareable Metrobus ticket).The round-the-clock staff we encountered were friendly and fortunately their English was better than our few words of Spanish. (Interestingly, we did not find much English spoken in the restaurants but we did avoid the tourist traps in the Plaza Mayor on purpose.)Our room was large enough and kept clean. The bathroom was very good, with natural light, a bidet and a powerful, hot shower that could squirt water in all kinds of places. There was no bath, however.Having read reviews here of other Madrid hotels, I should also add that the street was quiet at night and the aircon was fully functioning and adjustable.We went room only but there were numerous bakeries/cafes/ham museums nearby for a small breakfast before settling down to a big lunch at about 2pm. Aim for a siesta at about 6pm and dinner at 10pm and then you will be on Madrid time and will really enjoy yourself.All in all, a fun city and a good value hotel.
