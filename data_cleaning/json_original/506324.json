Even if you want to save money, stay at a lower quality hotel but not at a windowless one, after some time you feel suicidal. Apart from it, the location of the hotel is very close to the subway station (5 minute walk) and don't feel intimidated by the location of it because Chinatown is beautiful.

When we arrive and we found out the Hostel is bankrupt and we still found a man in that hostel but he told us that the people manage this hostel is runaway. We are worried because its Christmas period and immediately found a hotel and we saw Hotel81 just in front Chinatown MRT.The hotel rate is day by day increase due to nearer to Christmas and we had no choice to paid 3 nite to stay there due to last minute.Beside , they need us paid for 3 nights fees in full without print receipt to us and that time i said must need a receipt from them since its paid. Although it's out of our budget but is not a main problem , but there service is very bad!! First night , we had assign to the next door of the lift and beside our room that is a fire alarm system , every 5 sec will \"Beep\" 1time. It was irratating , the whole we can't sleep. The next day we decide to change room and suddenly they restrict us cannot 4 people in a room. But when we had made our payment , there is no any restriction on headcount. But the staff no immediately take any action , then we just put our luggage on lobby. The same night , we back hotel around 12am and one of the staff mentioned we cant 4 ppl in a room. She keep called our room line ... ringing 5 minutes keep disturb us and ask our freind immediately left the hotel said their hotel rules just give friend come 10 minutes. If not should check in another room.The room is not cheap SGD220 ++ per nite! Somemore is late night force us to check in another room. The staff keep knocking our door and argue with us. She mentioned if tonight we will not check in another room , then she will forfeited our 3rd nite accomodation fees!!!We had mentioned to them , if they dare to forfeited and at first never said we cant 4 ppls in a room then we will report police.Beside , her attitude is forcing us and talk to us really no manners at all.Somemore we got the receipt of paying 3 nights accomodation. Its totally a scam , becareful of this hotel!! The next day , my other 2 fren is forcing to find another hotel to stay and almost other hotel is fully booking. That last day , just we 2 person in a room. Can you imagine when 12pm , they really want us to check out. The Staff is knocked 1 time and straight away use key to open our door and ask us to leave.

The location, food & shopping here is no doubt very good, but the hotel receptionist attitude sucks big time. When I read the past reviews, I felt even more ashamed of my own fellow countrymen. As I arrived at the lobby, I informed the plump, male receptionist that I have a booking for a room of 2. He stared at me, seemed to expect something from me. Then he asked rudely, \"Do you have proof that you have made a booking?\" I was a little shocked at the way he asked, but as usual, when I travel overseas, I would take out my identity card & credit card (since it's credit card booking) so that receptionists could check the confirmation on their computers. He looked at my ID & CC & said that those are useless & can't prove that I had booked a room. I was like, huh? Then what can prove it? He didn't want to check the computer. He expected a print out confirmation of the room that I booked online. I apologized & said that I don't have it with me, but surely my ID & CC are better proofs than a print out which can be misplaced & land in anyone's hands? He got frustrated & said that without the print out, he could cancel my booking straightaway. Deep down I wanted to cancel it & walk off, but I don't want to kick up a fuss with a receptionist who's unhappy working there, & I didn't want to keep my relatives waiting beside me. So I just apologized again & asked him to check the computer for my confirmation. He reluctantly did. The room is clean, but very tiny & cramped. There's only space for small backpacks, not luggages. There's no remote control for the flat screen tv, so you gotta look at the side of the tv closely to operate it. Air con remote control buttons are damaged for some. It's not worth US$95 at all.

Their 2pm check in policy is strictly enforced, which is fair, so I paid for another night, so I wouldn't have to sit around the sad little lobby from 7:30 am to 2pm. All fine, a this point I just really want a shower and a nap. It turns out that the walk in rate is $11 less than the online rate, go figure. They gave me a room that was 8X7 feet big and had no windows. The bathroom is the kind where you close the door and then the whole bathroom essentially serves as the shower stall. So the floor and toilet seat get wet and stay wet after you shower.They said there was nothing else available, and later they would try to move me. But after spending the previous 36 hours in a plane it was kind of too much to bear. Ok, so at this point, I decide I need a room with windows, so after taking a shower, I go back down and explained, nicely, that I needed to move to another hotel that is closer to the meetings I had that day. I was planning to move to another hotel and could they please refund one of the two nights I had paid for. They said no, in not a nice way, three reception staff ganging up on me, and said that the money back guarantee posted at the front desk applied to a 15 minute grace period (the 15 minute grace period is not indicated on said money back guarantee sign). They refused any kind of a refund and said that I agreed to everything, so I shouldn't complain. I said I realize that this was the policy, but I pointed out that it seemed a bit unreasonable to charge me 2 full nights for staying in their hotel for 3 hours. But they continued to be belligerent and unfriendly. So at this point I decide, I'm leaving anyway, so I went up to get my bags and as I was waiting to settle the bill at the front desk, there were several other people who they were adamantly refusing to issue any kind of refund. So this is likely to be their general MO.

But hey, so is the piece of concrete outside the MRT. I could have easily saved myself $80 + and rolled up a sleeping back there. The concrete would have been just as comfortable as the bed. I have travelled for many years and it is the worst bed I can remember i have slept in. It probably didn't help that my back is the best at the moment, but it was easily the hardest bed i have ever slept on. It had no give it in whatsoever. It reminded me of the times I have fallen asleep on the carpet in front of the tv and the i wake up feeling sore because of the pressure of my body on the floor without any give in it. The amazing thing is, I generally like firmish beds. Anyway, apart from that keeping me awake, I had the noise of the airconditioner to contend with as well. I thought it was the next room having a shower and it would soon stop. Then i realised the noise wasn't going away and i would have to put up with it all night. To make matters worse, it is a small room and the airconditioner is above the bed. After realising noise of the airconditioner I then heard what i thought was fish tank. I though it was somewhere hidden in the room and was going to be an added surprise. The surprise was, the bubbling like the noise of the water in a fish tank was from the aircondtioner as well. BONUS! So, after trying to settle into my bed, trying to block out the aircon noises, i then realised i could here a man snoring in the room next to me. At least it put my mind off the bed. After not being able to sleep, mainly due to the bed (i got used to the other noises), I got fed up (at 2am) and decided to ask reception if i could move to a room with a softer bed. I couldn't believe it when all reception did was laugh.

Due to the festive season, the rate were very high. After comparing the price and location, we decided to have one night stay at this hotel. What we felt when we first step in the hotel room was OMG, the room is so small and worst still there is no window. The bathroom is so small too. Luckily we changed to another hotel on the second night.

Thankfully it turned out to be for just one night!! As other reviews have stated, the exterior and the lobby are very attractive, but beware of what you're getting for your money! None of our rooms had one window between them. They are extremely small, to such an extent that the double bed just about fits into the room and one has to turn sideways to walk down the side! The air conditioning units are incredibly noisy, but because there are no windows you have to have them on during the night. One of our rooms stunk of alcohol, one stunk of an incredibly strange smell which we still can't decipher. Finally, there are no carpets on the floor of the hotel, just tiles, so you can hear everybody walking past your door at all hours of the night. Basically, don't waste your money here. It's worth spending just that little more to upgrade yourslef to a cardboard box on Smith Street!", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "BKK", "Title": "\u201cI've stayed in better Backpacker Hostels\u201d", "Author": "Ulterium", "ReviewID": "UR7486938", "Content": "What can i say.. we were put on the ground floor of the hotel in a windowless room.

I'm only writing this review now since I needed time to just sit down and write reviews about the hotels I've stayed in for the past few months. I choose this hotel since I wanted a budget hotel around Chinatown (near the office). It seems that every time I'm in Singapore, the office can't book a hotel for me since there's always a convention or a series of conventions happening around Singapore which would make it difficult to reserve a room for me. I decided on Hotel 81 Chinatown since it's right across the Chinatown MRT station. In terms of location, this hotel is convenient. It's walking distance to Smith Street where one can get affordable yummy food. There are bus stations and MRT station nearby. Since it's a budget hotel, there are no frills. Internet is not free. The room is a bit small. The toilet seat gets wet whenever I took a shower since the bathroom is so small. There's no cabinet for clothes - just a place where one can hang clothes. Of course, I had to deal with a lot of curious questions from local people whenever they find out I'm staying here. I have heard about the other reputation of the other branches of Hotel 81. So whenever they ask me how do I find it, I reply \"It's difficult to get a hotel room. All I want is a clean bed and hot water. And this hotel provides it.\"", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Anglia", "Title": "\u201cIf you like staying in a windowless cupboard!!!\u201d", "Author": "PeterC48", "ReviewID": "UR6831408", "Content": "This is a pretty looking hotel from the outside, the reception is also quite nice but the rooms are something of a shock! We had booked a \"superior double\" for a couple of days and on arrival we were offered a choice of very small rooms with or without a window. When I say very small, I mean just enough room for the bed and a space round it big enough only to walk round. No space to even open a suitcase let alone any wardrobe space to hang clothes. The rooms looked clean enough but they are just too tiny and cell like to be acceptable. We checked out after one night in spite of losing the payment for the second night. If you want somewhere low cost and are prepared for a tiny room then OK, but we were expecting something along the style of an IBIS, a simply furnished basically equipped room with a window and enough room to move.
