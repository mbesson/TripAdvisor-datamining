When I booked on line I expected an option to come up for the parking, but as it did not I phoned the hotel for assistance. The lady I spoke to did not know anything about the parking, nor did her colleagues, so I sought alternative parking options. When we arrived at the hotel, the reception is very nice, but the staff were a little unhelpful (but not rude). I checked into the room which was very small, although this is not a problem for me but may be for some. It was quite worn and in need of a refurb. I tried to use the WiFi but this did not work, and when I asked at reception was told there was nothing that could be done The major problem with this hotel was that it was impossible to sleep in the room I had. The room is next to the lift, which is very old and very loud. This creaked and clunked every time it was used. There is a youth hostel a couple of building down, which had revellers outside and in the park opposite all night. I have no problem with people enjoying themselves, however the single glazed window did nothing to prevent the noise. The bed was like sleeping on a sack of potatoes. It was worn, uneven and lumpy. I did ask at reception if there was another room available but unfortunately the hotel was apparently full. I did not get one minutes sleep. There are some plusses to the hotel. The rate was excellent @ \u00a369 per night, and it is perfectly situated for the tube. However I feel the negatives outweigh the positives and it is not a hotel I will be using again, and I do not feel it is worthy of the Best Western Brand.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201ccosy hotel\u201d", "Author": "186605Beachbum", "ReviewID": "UR125718655", "Content": "I stayed at the Burns last weekend with three friends and all of us agree that it is a clean, cosy hotel.

We chose this hotel based on it's location, the only good thing about our booking. Everything else however was a disaster. 1. All three of us stayed in separate rooms and all had the exact same problem of \"over used\" uncomfortable and crunchy beds. 2. The rooms were very small. The bathrooms smelt damp and one of them only had a shower cubicle. 3. One of us had to stay in a basement room which smelt of smoke every time people had a cigarette by the hotel front doors. 4. The wi-fi is exceptionally weak proving very difficult to do any work in the evenings. 5. The hotel staff came across rude, un-interested in the customer or their own job satisfaction for that matter. 6. The breakfast was poor quality and very expensive, we ended up eating breakfast at a Gregg's cafe up the road. 7. All three of us had to have cold showers, even at 7am there seemed to be no hot water. 8. The lift was smaller than a phone box and we had to go to our rooms one at a time. 9. The door key cards kept loosing their data. 10. After seating for breakfast on the first morning we were then told to go and pay for our breakfast at the reception rather than adding it to our room. There were no signs saying this was the process before we checked in. 11. Very squeaky floorboards in ALL THREE rooms and what sounded like every other room. 12. The cold water is not even cold. I had to use bottled water to brush my teeth with. 13. Finally the basement room had bars on the windows, it was like a prison cell. This review is not exaggerated and I fail to see how there are 5 star ratings for this hotel.

From the very beginning I will say, it was hard to find things unpleasant about this hotel. From the moment we arrived several hours before check-in the experience was nothing less than great! After reading some of the reviews about noise, I emailed a few weeks before arrival and requested 'one of their better rooms' and made note that we are light sleepers. When I arrived so early the staff let me know they could immediately accomodate my early arrival, but it would not be in a room type I had requested. As we were staying over a week, I opted to just leave my bags in hold and wait a few hours for the original room. After visiting the pub just steps away (The Blackbird) for a Full English and getting familiar with the GREAT AREA just a 1-2 minute walk from the tube, we returned and found a great room waiting for us - we stayed in room 104. Several of the complaints have been concerning business traveller amenities, and I will say upfront I did not get any impression of this being a business destination hotel. Although the Wi-Fi worked great in our room, I did hear several guests unhappy with the connections in their rooms. If you are on holiday, the need to sit in your room and surf the web shouldn't be a high priority as connections are available just down the street and several fast food chains and Starbucks for no charge. The floors do 'creak' as some of the other reviewers stated, but keep in mind you chose a Best Western to fit your budget, this is not a 5* hotel and the building is quite old - the sound is nothing I'm sure a pair of earplugs couldn't cancel. Even with 4 large bags between my wife and I the distance from the tube was easily managed. Earls Court tube stop is handicapped accesible so generally their is a lift available, although on our stay it was out. The location is ideal for tourists as their are so many things within a short walk, and the tube to see the rest of the main attractions. I can't say enough for the staff - they were beyond friendly and although through a thick Polish accent spoke great English. The breakfast is good, but if it's not included in the room charge I may have gone to the Blackbird, as the food was just the same for a lesser price. I honestly can not say enough great things about this place!

Earl's Court is both zone 1 and zone 2 and it's both cheap and fast to get there from heathrow airport by Piccadilly tube line, or a short walk from the Easybus stop from Getwick. Now, it say its a three star hotel. I booked 5 nights through booking.com with an average rate of about 100 GBP. The prime reason I choose this hotel among others in this area is that it offers free wifi, and of course, the brand name gives some guarantee, I thought. These are not so. In fact, this is an \"independently owned and operated hotel\" (as it posted on the front door) which somehow bears the Best Western label, through some licencing agreement, I guess. I am surprised the receptionist greets me was not quite fluent in English. Okay, we get our room, while it is a VIctorian house, I did not expect it takes a very narrow corridor and about 10 steps before reaching my room. Okay, we are young, we can walk a bit despite the large suitcases plus hand carrys we carried. Into the room. It is small (okay, it's London), smaller than some B&B I used to stay in London. The wardrobe is a laugh - It is about only 1.5' wide and can hold about 2 coats and a pair of shirt. There is a safe in it - but it charges you GBP2 per day to use - which, to me, is unacceptable for a 3-star hotel room costs 100 GBP per night. Then, there is no fridge in the room! Even some B&B in London equip with a fridge! The bed is a small 6'x4' and is rather small considered it a double room. To sum up, the room is merely a B&B with a Best Western label so that it can charge a overprice. Then, it comes to another nightmare of the room - the wifi. And this is the prime reason why I say service is poor in the title. The free wifi offered is a joke (as in some previous posts pointed out). It was very weak in our room (1/5 to 2/5 in all the 2 phones and a notebook computer we used). And it takes like 15-30 minutes just to connect to the signal. When we finally goes through, type in the password, it just comes off every 5 or 10 minutes. When we complained this, the receptionist first offered to reset the router for us. Then, it works for a few hours. The next morning, the same issue came again. We asked for a reset of router again and it worked again. We didn't know how long it lasted as we checked our message and left our room. In the evening, the signal was dead again. When we asked for a reset of router, this time, the staff refused. Perhaps she thought we are troublesome but his explanation was that there were many customers connected and we were the only one making complaint. Then, I asked if it was because we lived from a blind spot of wifi signal. Then, she immediately said that the router was in fact very close to our room! She asked us to go to the reception at ground floor, where she claimed the signal strongest (despite the router being close to our room and the reception is quite a few rooms away and a floor down) connect there and go back to our room. In fact we tried and I didn't work - the signal is weak even at the reception and unconnectable. Then, when we ask if we can change our room, where other many people has connected to the wifi as she claims, she vaguely claimed the signal is the same everywhere in the hotel (despite her earlier claim that the siganl is either strongest in our room or down in the reception). After I insist, she offer a change of a room the same block, one floor above us on the next day. And finally they could reset the router then, which \"many customers have connected\". On the next day, a senior member of staff told us that in fact the router of the block we stayed had problems and they had arranged maintenance. They offered us a room in the other block. Once there, the wifi was working well (albeit still a bit unstable). Apart from the unability to use wifi in the first three days of stay where we stay in our first room (which we have paid for including the wifi), the service is poor. They simply refuse to face and address to our needs. Poor service, poor room. I would recommend you staying in other hotels, which are many in the area.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bern, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cWhat a super place\u201d", "Author": "sg3013", "ReviewID": "UR121312467", "Content": "I can't believe I have visited London almost twice a year since about ten years whitout ever hearing anything about this hotel.

However, instead of a large high-ceilinged room, nicely fitted out, and with bay windows overlooking the square, we got a small, cramped dark room down an inconvenient short flight of stairs at the rear with small windows, no view and basic furniture (for the same price). To add insult to injury, every time we went in or out of our room during the day we had to struggle past the unappealing sight of piled up dirty sheets from the other rooms which were left in the short walkway to our room and we had to avoid tripping over the vacuum cleaner which was also always stored there. We were obviously of little interest to the hotel as repeat visitors and were given what was surely the worst room in the place. Having not wanted to start our trip (which was actually a special occasion trip for us) with complaints, I didn't say anything on the first day but by day 3 we were very fed up with the dirty washing we had to edge past and made a complaint. We were told this would change but all that happened was that the washing was stored in a large laundry bin on the way to our room. Trying to use the bar one evening for a quiet drink, my husband ordered a beer but found the blaring television very intrusive and asked the young woman working there if she would mind turning it down...even the adverts were played at full blast. Nothing happened. At the second time of asking, she couldn't even be bothered to swivel her head from what was obviously her favourite program but just snapped that she had turned it down. Fed up with adverts for hair products etc, my husband gave up and left. Staff serving in the breakfast room showed little idea of what might be pleasant for the guest rather than the easiest for them, always attempting to squeeze us into the rather odd tables in the first room (which tilt up towards you so that drinks, cereals etc flow downwards to the centre) rather than suggesting the more spacious area in the conservatory. You have to be firm and insist on finding your own table. This hotel gets business people attending Earls Court & Olympia exhibitions & conventions etc and is apparently also listed on some package tours. As a result, it appears to run very close to full capacity. Unfortunately this means they couldn't care less about the experience they are delivering and guest satisfaction is at the bottom of their list of priorities. I always hope to find a hotel I can go back to for my regular London trips (2-3 times a year) but it definitely won't be this one.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi", "Title": "\u201cWell located and affordable\u201d", "Author": "KushanMitra", "ReviewID": "UR118365099", "Content": "I found this hotel after reading the reviews on this site incidentally, and I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.

Second room (because of snow our flight back home was cancelled and we could stay in the hotel for the extra night, but in a different room) was a bit less small, and warmer, so we probably were just a tad unlucky with the first one ;) First night there, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night, (and repeatedly 2 times more). To be clear: you can't sleep through it, it was loud enough. We gathered to the lobby, were the personnel assured us there was no fire....Didin't see any smoke either.

What we would have liked to see different, was that they would have left a note or something in our room the second day, to let us know the fire alarm issue was resolved.

So I had to resume my work at Mcdonald's. Also I didn't enjoy the breakfast, so I used to grab a snack from M&S or starbucks around the corner.

On the plus side, it is well located -- only minutes from the underground -- it is clearly well-managed, clean, efficient, comfortable (to a point), and benefiting from the virtue of helpful and friendly staff. Rates are reasonable and a good, continental-style buffet breakfast is provided. On the negative side, it is small. The foyer is small -- you can live with that -- the bar is small, and the dining room, although adequate, feels cramped. Small tables congest the floor space to the extent that although you may be dining alone, you sense you are encroaching on the adjacent diner. That absence of personal space is such that on being assigned a table, you feel like a battery hen placed in its slot for feeding. The lounge area is so small, I missed it for the entire duration of my week's stay. I think I may have passed through it without noticing. Or was it ever there? Step into a bedroom in the Burns and you are instantly inspired to take up the study of nanotechnology. Our bedroom was really small, although it was allegedly a double room. In fact everything was scaled down, including the beds, furniture and the bathroom. But it was clean, well presented and diligently attended to everyday. And after a day or so, you adjust -- shrink -- to fit the room, and it doesn't seem too bad. The hotel claims to provide free WiFi, but this is largely hit and miss ...... and mostly miss. When you can connect, it is so slow it is hardly usable. But it does exist, and unlike some hotels, the Burns make it availabe for free. One black mark concerns catering practices. One morning at breakfast I noticed the senior waitress top-up a milk jug with the remains of milk from jugs on nearby tables, which other diners had left after finishing their breakfast. In fact, I couldn't fail but notice, because it was at my table and she did it in front of me. Now this is akin to presenting you with a potential reservoir of bacteria to start your day. One has to ask, what is in the minds of the Burns management to countenance such a practice. It is deplorable, and it is dangerous. It also manifests an uncaring attitude to the well-being of its guests to place people's health at risk just to save on the cost of a little fresh milk. I am sorry to have to mention the above, because overall I feel the Burns Hotel makes a genuine effort for its guests. Their approach is professional, their staff are genuinely friendly and they are streets ahead of similar sized hotels in this area in terms of what they offer. What they definitely should not offer is the chance to develop an unsolicited bout of gastroenteritis -- and that is something they need to address. The acid test: Would I stay here again? Yes. Would I recommend the Burns Hotel? Yes. So, sorry to introduce a sour taste into my comments about a good hotel.

It was a charity trip so our room prices were heavily discounted but the prices advertised in reception started from \u00a3120 per night which even for London (and I am a Londoner!) seemed high. The room I had was on the 2nd floor. The twin room was pretty small, and the bathrom even smaller. If both of us were moving around it worked better if one of us sat still on a bed till the other one finished moving. The bathroom had the loo alongside the bath (which I have never liked in a bathroom) and the gap was very tight. Anyone bigger than a size 16 would be in trouble! The bath had an overhead shower which worked well, though the step out of the bath was fairly high. The room was clean, with freebie soaps, tea & coffee, etc. We were able to open the window partially for air in the hot weather which lets in some noise so if you are not used to trains or traffic be aware. The beds were tidy and clean. The hotel offered room service which we did not use though the restaurant was used and the food was good. The breakfast is sufficient with a good selection of continental food - cheese, ham, yoghurt, fruit, bread, croissants, jams, etc. The English breakfast was tasty and well cooked, though one morning it arrived cold and had to be sent back. Occasional wait for items to be replenished. The restaurant is fairly large and could seat a number of guests so space was not too bad. The bar was OK but had a limited range of drinks, and the wine was VERY expensive for the cheap brand they offered. TIP: Go to Threshers round the corner and stay in the room. The staff were all generally polite, efficient and friendly. The best thing about the hotel is the location very near Earls Court tube and the range of eating places - everything from pubs, subway and macdonalds, to zizzis and an excellent italian place past the station, Bistro Benito.

It (the room) was clean and comfortable, we did not find any major problems with it. The hotel is situated very close to an underground tube and we found it easy to navigate around the city. Although it was basic, an all you can eat continental breakfast was included in our package and we found that if we ate a large enough brekki (and risked looking like pigs in the process!) we were fuelled enough to keep going through out the day, making it to dinner easily. It may sound extreme but it was a great money saver, and plus, brekki was so nice it was easy to eat so much! All in all, if you want a clean, easily accessable, value for money hotel with friendly staff then this is the place for you. *Small note: There are quite a few stairs/narrow corridoors in this hotel so if you or someone you're travelling with have bad knees perhaps ask for a more easy accessable room near a lift if possible?*", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCharming and in a great location\u201d", "Author": "mayday2073", "ReviewID": "UR26942104", "Content": "This hotel wasn\u2019t that bad actually.

Of the three hotels we stayed in on our 11 day trip (the other two in Paris and Venice) this was the most expensive and not a value for the money. PROS - Location. Just around the corner from Earls Court tube station you can get anywhere easily from here. - The bed was reasonably comfortable. The room was very large with a large wardrobe and desk. Although it looked out directly onto the street we were able to close the heavy drapes and have privacy. - The shower head was the best of the trip.

And the whole thing is kind of confusing becuase some people have some parts of breakfast included, others have other parts. But the selection was nice and we were satisfied. - The in room coffee and tea selection was nice. Although I have seen better it was just fine and a nice touch.

I had brought a bunch of food with me thinking that everything was going to cost an arm and a leg, but I was pleasantly surprised to find better food prices than Chicago (where I was living at the time). Bottled water is especailly cheap in London! My roommate enjoyed the fact that there was a McDonald's close by as well. There were several other fast food places but we pretty much stuck to Sommerfield and McDonald's. There is also a Barclays (bank) right there and I believe that they do not charge a service fee. Yay! And then of course, the location is prime because of the Earl's Court tube stop, just a few minutes from the hotel. It was a quick ride into the main tourist spots (10-15 mintues probably) and SO easy to use. The hotel itself was also quite adorable. It's true that the rooms are small, but you are in Europe. We expected small and were actually surprised at how big our room was. Not big by American standards but bigger than what we were expecting. We had a bathroom, two twin beds, a TV, desk, and still some room to walk around. I can't say that the beds were especially comfortable, but they did the job. And the best part was that we had the cutest little balcony that looked out onto a large lawn and what looked like beautiful brick apartments. It was February when we were there so we didn't spend a lot of time on the balcony but it was nice knowing it was there and it also doubled as a fridge at night and we could put our goodies from Sommerfield out there to stay cold. The only negative I can say about this hotel is that the staff was not the most friendly. They were pretty snappy with us when we checked in and we were put off trying to talk to them the rest of our vacation. But this wasn't a big deal. It's nice if they are nice, but I don't usually ask many questions of hotel staff anyway.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cNice Convenient hotel\u201d", "Author": "jetsaver", "ReviewID": "UR11159464", "Content": "Spent two days here 23-24th November 2007 with my husband and son to celebrate his birthday.

We bought a weekly pass on The Tube and it was awesome. We traveled all over London this way because taxi's cost so much. The hotel was super small. The lobby was little and the hallway to the elevator was narrow. After we checked in we wheeled our luggage to the elevator to get on only to find out it is a one man elevator if you have luggage. I'm from Texas where everything is big so this was just too funny. Anyway, my husband went up first and the elevator came back for me. When I got off of the elevator he was waiting for me with this huge grin and said \"You aren't going to belive this.\" I walked in and the room is probably 15' x 10' with a huge window. There are two twin beds up against one wall and a dresser and a tall wardrobe on the other wall. There is a small bathroom big enough for one person at a time with another huge window. There is no air conditioning. I've never been anywhere with out A/C! We both laughed until we were crying. I was thinking there is no way I will be staying here. But we opened up the windows and the best breeze blew through the room and we called room service for a fan which they immediately brought up to us. After the initial shock of the room being so tiny, I fell completely in love with it. The beds are very comfortable, it is very clean, it has a TV that works, and the shower is powerful...what else do you need? There is a park across the street and you could watch the children play and it is just so beautiful. There are no screens on the windows so you could actually sit in the window and watch the world go by. The entire time we were in London I saw one gnat. In my town the mosquitos are so big they can carry you away. One block away is a busier street with restaurants and all kinds of stores. We went to the small grocery store every day and bought drinks and fruit. The food in London is nothing like in the states. Our favorite restaurant was The Republic of Texas and we ate there 3 times. Everything is VERY expensive. We saw the changing of the guards at 11:30am. When the flag is flying on top of the palace that means that the Queen is there. She was there when we were there and that was kind of neat to know. We went on the London Eye, saw castles, Big Ben, London Bridge, museums, and so much more. We took the Eurostar to Paris and another train to Scotland for day trips. Scotland was very interesting and cold. Paris was okay and we saw the Eiffel Tower and cruised on the Seine River but eveyone in Paris kind of snobby. Overall, I would go back to London in a heart beat and stay at this hotel again.

The towels were changed every day. There is no air-condition and it was getting quite hot in the afternoon but we could leave the window open during the night so it was bearable. The English breakfast was superb and the continental breakfast buffet well equiped; the staff were very friendly both in the restaurant and at the front desk. Although it's just a short walk down to Earl's Court station the hotel is located in a very quiet neighbourhood. And there are plenty of shops and restaurants around, even a 24h Sainsbury's supermarket! We would stay at this hotel again but next time we would choose a bigger room - not on the top floor.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price\u201d", "Author": "tottie", "ReviewID": "UR5449415", "Content": "Have just returned from a theatre break.

Several of my work collegues who were also staying at the hotel had similar problems with the heat, so it wasnt just a problem with one room. Also the rooms were very small.

The triple room is MUCH bigger (more than double the size, I think). Also, the bathrooms in the triple rooms are a bit larger. Given it's draw backs, the staff was very friendly - they upgraded us to a triple room free of charge, and the room was clean. As for location, it is fantastic.

The neighborhood felt very safe, as well (even for a woman traveling alone - I was there a couple of nights without my husband and still felt quite safe). I would recommend the hotel, but with severe reservations. If you can't afford the upgrade to a triple - don't stay here!

Also, the location is great--just off the Earl's Court tube stop and very easy to get to pretty much everything. But that's about all I can say that is positive about this hotel. We arrived on one of the hottest days on record in years in London, only to find that the \"air conditioning\" the hotel claims to have is only in the hallways (that is, of course, on the rare occasions when they didn't have the heat on). They did provide us with a tiny fan, but it didn't help much. The room was exceedingly small, but we expected that because most European hotels are like that. Be prepared for your feet to hang over the edge of the bed (I'm only 5'7\" and mine did...). The beds were also quite lumpy and uncomfortable. On night two, we found a roach practically the size of a car roaming about our room. To be fair, they credited us a few pounds at checkout for that, but that courtesy was later overshadowed by the huge annoyance I experienced as a result of them screwing up the charges on my credit card (see below). On night three, the room reeked of raw sewage. At first we thought it was coming from outside, but it was actually coming from the bathroom. Needless to say, the fan didn't help THAT much, either! Over a week after checkout, I discovered that the hotel had failed to release the hold they placed on my credit card when I checked in (even though they had also charged me THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE STAY when I checked out, thereby taking up double the room on my credit card). Apparently, as I found out after paying for several international calls, the hold is not released until 10 days after they authorize it...which means that this hold will have been on my credit card a total of 25 days by the time it is actually released. They failed to mention that little tidbit when I checked in.
