We were literally the only people in the hotel. The staff was very helpful and accommodating, always answering our questions and tending to all of our needs. There is only 1 a la carte restaurant at this property but all the food was quite delicious, if you're here for 7 nights you will most definitely get to try everything on the menu. The \"delicatessen\" is basically non existent. The rooms were average but very spotless, I thought the bathroom was nicely upgraded. Since the property was so empty, there were some spiders in the room, a couple cockroaches outside- but this is Mexico so it's expected. The wifi is very spotty and isn't attainable in most of the rooms, sometimes in the hallways but mostly in the lobby. The beach is indeed a 15min shuttle ride away to the Mayan Palace which is definitely a downfall if you're looking for a beach vacation. The beach itself is very rocky (Mayan Riviera does have the second largest barrier reef in the world) so please bring some water shoes. I hear there is fantastic scuba/snorkelling. The Mayan Palace has a 24 hour pool, unlimited golfing, numerous restaurants & a buffet. There is no disco on either property and Playa del Carmen is a 25 minute cab ride away.

The grounds are open for use to all hotels, but there is one pool that is solely for use by Grand Mayan guests. Absolutely gorgeous grounds with a 5 star staff. The Ocean Breeze is a bit damp, due to being in the jungle but after having the air conditioning on for a day or so, the musty smell subsides. Yeah, it's a fair piece from the bigger pools and the beach front. The trams will come get you in under 5 minutes any time - you just have to tell the staff you need a tram. The food at La Terazza back by Ocean Breeze was amazing. No more than we'd have paid for a very nice dinner in a good Italian restaurant. The staff was incredible. The pool is small and secluded but still gorgeous. The food at the Del Lago buffet on the property is good but a tad expensive for my price range for a buffet. The only other place we ate on property was Frida's. It was okay. Not good enough for my taste for the price paid but again, the staff was very good (By the way, ask for your bill when you are ready to leave or you will be there awhile. They have apparently been told or it is a cultural thing to not bring the bill until requested to do so). The staff almost all speak some English with the exception of some of the tram drivers and one of the bell boy/security/concierge guys we had. They all try very hard, though, and are unfailingly nice, polite and patient. The resort is about 15 minutes from Playa del Carmen (which is the best beach since the resort beach is too rocky for being in the water). It's about a $25 USD cab fare or I understand the shuttles run every 2 hours or so for much less. We were not partiers, so we didn't notice drink prices and we are more read on the beach people than swim on the beach people so we were fine with the resort beach. I purchased a stay online though a 3rd party broker and it was not advertised as requiring attendance at a timeshare presentation. After purchase, that portion was revealed. At that point, I should have walked away but I didn't. I wanted to take my mom on a nice trip for Christmas and this was an affordable way to do it. We might have been able to get out in under 6 hours if we had simply kept saying no, no, no. We failed in attempting to be humanly polite and not horribly rude. We pretty much spent an entire vacation day on this. I can't say if you could get out sooner or not, I only know that their presentation was different enough from my expectations of a timeshare that we were there for 6 hours. So... if you are strong enough to keep saying no, early and often, and you run across the opportunity to stay here on the property, do so. If you can find a good deal without being required to attend a presentation, that's even better. Disregarding the big sell we had to waste time on, this was simply a gorgeous property with excellent and professional staff. Not a party place while we were there, but more laid back.

We did not mind the golf cart rides to the big pool at the mayan. We enjoyed walking around to see the flamingos and crocodiles at the other part of the resort. What needs improvement: food at La terreza is not really kid friendly, especially if you have a picky eater like my 10 yr old, also could not get pizza delivered like you can at the other parts of the Mayan resort (even if you pay extra). Our biggest complaint was the service...pretty slow at la terreza although the guys working there were super nice. Service at the beach bar was absolutely ridiculous and slow. Felt ignored sometimes. Come to find out, there was 1 waiter who was assigned to wait on Ocean Breeze patrons....could not recognize who that was and it was not clear what drinks were included in the all inclusive..some days you could get a Mojito and some days you could not. We did enjoy dinner at the Havana Moon 2 nights and $12 / person was credited for the adults. We liked the kids' menu there and the adult food was delicious.

Alberto (management) has a very stressful job handling complaints, although I think if he would inform staff at the Mayan Palace this would not be complained about. Most of the arrivals that booked also with Bookit.com where not told of the rights to the food and swim up bars at the Mayan until they spoke with us... Is this a way of trying to keep guest at the Ocean Breeze?????? A little sneaky if that's the case! I had all my papers in order as this became a little of a fight to my rights at the swim up bar and Balche's!! Alberto took care of informing the staff at the Mayan, but still would happen on a daily basis. The Ocean front is not possible to walk in , but the amazing pools were great. Playa wasn't far away to go in the Ocean any how. Delago has great food and so does Balche's. The Mexican Feista was awesome with a great show and great food. As for smokers, I just you guys would have enough respect for us when we are eating and don't want to inhale your smoke. Please have some respect and go for a walk!!! Compared to the Principe Bahia it is very disappointing. I hope the staff gets trained properly and someone comes in to do some PR at the front desk. A new arrival at the OB resteraunt is Chuck. He is very well trained in English and service. I wish him all the luck with this resort and hope he gets promoted to front desk!!! I think with some real management skills this resort could do well , once the little Quirks and uninformed staff at the Mayan gets worked out.

Spent nine nights at the Ocean Breeze with my boyfriend, three sisters and brother-in-law. We knew that the hotel was a distance from the beach so were prepared for that. We usually stay at large all-inclusive properties, so this was quite a change for us. It was extremely relaxing to be at the Ocean Breeze and be waited on by friendly waiters trying very hard to please us. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner were cooked to order. The menu was somewhat limited, but very good. The rooms were modern and clean. We shuttled to the beach every day. The beach area was very nice with plenty of palapas and chairs. The Ocean Breeze did have a designated beach area, but we didn't always sit there because of the wind. Preferred a different area and had a little difficulty once getting served there. But did eventually get service. Upon check-in you are given the all-inclusive details, which are: La Terraza Restaurant - meals and unlimited domestic drinks, from 7am until 10:30pm and room service from 11am -10:30pm. This is our restaurant at the Ocean Breeze. Del Lago Restaurant - buffet dinners. This was at the Mayan Palace. Buffet food was excellent. Drinks were limited to certain items for Ocean Breeze guests. Del Lago was closed on Wednesdays when we could go to Frida's which is what the pool restaurant converted to at night. This was a sit-down with waiter service and the food was excellent. Fantastic shrimp! But we were allowed Wednesdays only. The Beach Club, which was in the Havana Moon during the day. Did not open until 11 and closed at 5:30. There was no self-service snack bar here. You had to find a waiter to order from and the Ocean Breeze had its own menu including pizza, burgers, hot dogs, etc. Before it opened at 11am, there was no where to get drinks. We did try the pool bar and got served once or twice, but also refused service because we were Ocean Breeze guests. We never tried the swim-up bar for this reason, but I know others from our hotel did get served there. This made it somewhat limited and confusing. We did have to sign for everything and make sure that we received the \"unlimited experience\" and the bill said a few cents only for record-keeping purposes. Although we felt a little like second class guests, when I saw the prices the other people were paying for drinks and food, I felt much better about it and could put up with it. A pina colada, for example, was about $10. Pizzas were $15. So we felt that getting this all included was a great value. The food was probably the best we have ever had at an all-inclusive. I would suggest they open the beach bar at 10 instead and have some type of self-service snack area for us there. The shuttles did get busy some times and you may have to wait, but not too bad. One negative was that for excursions, even ones booked through the hotel, people had to walk out to the road and over to the security gate at the Mayan Palace. The shuttles couldn't take us there and apparently they didn't want to pick us up at the Mayan Palace lobby. We did take the Playa Express into Playa del Carmen for shopping one day. Just cross the road and wait for the bus. It is 15pesos to go into town, but 20 pesos to get back. The hotel also offers a shuttle into town from the Mayan Palace. All in all a great value and wonderfully restful vacation.

The star rating I believe is higher then what it is rated. I\u2019ve been to several 4 and above star resorts that did not come close to what we experienced here. It has to be that this hotel isn\u2019t situated on or near the beach that brings the rating down. The Ocean Breeze sits on the grounds of the Mayan Palace/Grand Mayan and Grand Luxxe. The complex is HUGE. With the all-inclusive plan, you have full access at the Ocean Breeze for food & drinks but also you have some privileges with your all inclusive plan to use at the Havana Club, (Beach Club) & the Del Largo Restaurant within the complex. You do have to sign each time for food & drinks which can bothersome but it didn\u2019t bother us. You have use of the one of the largest pools we\u2019ve ever seen at the Mayan Palace. There is a shuttle service that will take you around all around the complex. Just plan accordingly to the time schedule and you will never be stuck. Points to the review: Check In & ALL INCLUSIVE: if you pay attention at the time of check in and listen to them explain all that is covered throughout the complex, you won\u2019t be confused. If by chance the front desk staff doesn\u2019t give you the map, please ask them to explain it to you. ROOMS: Nice size, modern, real clean and comfortable. LOBBY \u2013 has free Wi-Fi service. If your room is located near the area you will get Wi-Fi in your room as well. They also offer pastries, fruit coffee, tea, water, soda and beer in this area. There is an area to book tours if you want. SERVICE: We had excellent service the whole week. I believe it really is the people themselves. We are fun people, we smile and we enjoy life. The ones who complain and don\u2019t accept things are the people who write negative reviews. We access the situation and if there is an issue we would address it by taking the proper measures not yell or get mad at an individual. FOOD \u2013 everything is excellent. At Ocean Breeze your meals are made to order. Different menu items are available for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Another alternative for dinner is at the Del Largo which offers an extensive of buffet and grill items which change each night. There is an Italian, Asian, Steak & pool restaurant. You can pay to eat at them \u2013 we choose not to since we liked what was offered to us already. The pizzas are very good! Get one delivered right to your papaya. Room service available. DRINKS: Wines: Sauvignon Blanc for white, Merlot for red. Mimosas or just plain champagne, Beer: canned beer not draft: Corona, Corona Light, Pacifico and some other that I did not know. You can pretty much have any other drink you want with spirits. My husband loved his bucket of beers. GROUNDS: Just beautiful-you must check out the grounds all over the resort. There is a flamingo and crocodile viewing areas on the grounds. There is also a shopping center on the grounds that sells food, booze, beer, wine, drinks, clothing, jewelry, gifts and a nice cafe. Awesome golf course (for a fee). Very nice spa & services. POOLS: At Ocean Breeze, pleasant and peaceful. Mayan Palace has the largest pool we\u2019ve ever seen and you must check out the Atrium style at the Grand Mayan, what a site! Grand Luxxe not much access it\u2019s much secured but we did get in to take a peak. BEACH: Rocky but who cares? Walk a bit and you can swim no problem. I thought it was cool to walk the rocks and view all sorts of fish. I like the view of the rocks and ocean, it\u2019s a very nice to look at with the turquois water in the background. I took awesome photos. NIGHTLIFE: At the Del Largo there is a very well-produced show at 8pm for about an hour \u00bd. At the Mayan Pool-some nights there was live music. At the Havana Club there was a live band each night. If you are looking to party it up till 4am \u2013 this is not for you. Just go into Playa del Carmen if you want to party all night via cab service. The town is less than 15 minutes away. There is a nice wine bar that offered music that was located between the Asian & Italian restaurants with an outdoor terrace. Side note: you can take a shuttle from the Mayan Palace lobby into Playa Del Carmen daily. It\u2019s 40.00 pesos per person (like $2.00) each way. Set schedule starting at 9am returning around 8pm. All and all, we loved this place. It did feel a slight bit strange being with an all-inclusive plan with the owners of the timeshare and residential units in the complex. Here we were sitting at the pool ordering our bucket of beers, or margaritas not paying but the owner next to us had to pay each time they ordered something. I guess it is a new concept we were told to mix AI and non-AI in one place. We would go back in a heartbeat! I miss it already.

The one thing we noticed about this hotel was that it was quiet. There weren't that many other people stayed at the hotel and at times we had the pool and the restaurant to ourselves. If you're looking for nightlife and spring break revelers, i suggest looking elsewhere. We traveled with two children (6&8) and they enjoyed the main pool area at the Mayan Palace. It's an absolutely huge pool that doesn't exceed about 3.5 feet. Our boys had no problems with the depth. The beach in front of the resort is rocky, but a tip from another traveler to walk 15 min left to find a perfect beach was right on. As part of the all inclusive program at the hotel you have access to a beach club at the main pool/beach, to the del lago restaurant which has shows 6 nights of the week, and the restaurant at the hotel. The food at all of the restaurants was great. Also, staff at the Hotel restaurant were very accommodating when we asked for adjustments to the menu items. Rooms were modern and very clean. There were a few minor draw backs; waiting for a shuttle at times, having to sign for everything at the mayan palace and lack of a dedicated walking path to the Mayan Palace. However, this place is very new (about a year) and it appears that there are plans to expand it significantly in the future. I assume that these items will be addressed. We had a great time and will recommend this to friends.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Bay, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAccomidations and food 5 STARS!\u201d", "Author": "joel050283", "ReviewID": "UR94755317", "Content": "All in all the hotel was amazing. We paid $1400 all inclusive tax in including flight and could not of got a better value. The rooms and hotel is gorgeous, and very quiet. The staff were very helpful. The rooms and food were better then most 5 star hotels. The rooms were comparable to a higher end buisness class hotel. I assume its the location of the hotel being away from the beach dragging its start rating down. The resturant on site was great, the cooks and servers were fantastic. You basically order what you want, and they cook it just right. The drinks were good. You have to take a shuttle to the mayan palace to get to the beach and buffet dinner, which is a short ride away, and you never wait long for the shuttle. If you like the nightlife this isnt the place. It is more of a laid back place. I found even if you wanted to go out at night, it wasnt an option because drinking beer and eating for 12 hours straigh puts you in bed by 830 9 every night anyway. The only complaint is the all inclusive plan at the Mayan palace is confusing. We were told we had acsess at the swim up bars, but when we got there they didnt serve us. We complained and they let us have acsess, but we were the only couple at the hotel who did. The mayan palace staff were good, but some of the time share guests werent to happy to find out what we paid, as the were forking out $30 a person for the buffet and $10 a drink at the bars. I felt a bit out of place there at times, which was kind of a downer, but we made the best of it. The beach at the mayan palace is nice, but the rocks make it hard to swim. I would say all in all if you get a good price the service and quality of accomidations and food is amazing. You dont really get an al la carte dinner, its just at the buffet on mexican night cause you have to make a reservation. The snack bar at the hotel was kinda non exsistence. If you order something during the day the resturant waiter has to come and get it for you, which is a 50 yard away walk, so it was just easier to go get it at the resturant to go. One big bonus, is they give you canned beer, so you can order some to take with you when you go to town or wherever. One piece of advice is when you go to the pool, grab the ice bucket from your room they will fill it with ice and beer, cause the beer isnt always the coldest from the fridge.

My partner and I were welcomed by a charming gentleman named Alberto followed by Monserrat, the counter clerk. They received us with a warm welcome and some frozen tamarindo margaritas and guacamole.

Throughout our entire vacation stay, we had three beautiful people pampering us in their own unique style of hospitality (Monserrat, Paola, and Alberto). These three individuals were key to our amazing experience. Room service was efficient and loaded with great servers (Luis and Nacho). The cleanliness of our room was impeccable. The cleaning lady surprised us with creative figures of animals that she made out of towels.Two thumbs up for her creativity.

I was a little terrified after reading some of the reviews, but for the rate that we got, I just figured we'd run with it and expect nothing. I am so glad to say that we absolutely LOVED our stay and would return in a heartbeat. Hotel - I think I remember reading an earlier review where someone mentioned that they felt like they were at somone's home and I couldn't agree more. The hotel was practically empty, we maybe saw 15 guests the entire week that we were there. Basically we had full access to the joint and it was fabulous. We were often the only people at the Ocean Breeze restaurant - no matter what time of day. Front desk staff was very attentive and helpful. Ocean Breeze Food - The restaurant by the pool is very good! Everything is made to order, and while the menu is rather small, we liked everything on it. We ordered room service a couple of times, and the food was typically delivered in under 15 minutes. The little deli in the lobby wasn't really staffed - so we just asked the front desk staff if they could get us something from it (water, soda, fruit). It wasn't really stocked with sandwiches or the like, but I'm assuming it's mostly because the hotel was pretty empty and they didn't want things to go to waste. Rooms - Being that the hotel is only three months old, the place is in tip-top shape. The housekeeping staff was great. Beds were a little on the hard side. Bathroom was extremely large and the shower could easily fit three people. Really the only gripe we had were the roughness of the sheets (which made our sunburn hurt even more). Most of the tv channels were in Spanish, however, randomly the HBO channels were either in Spanish or English (with subtitles) depending on what was showing. Shuttle - Every day we took the tram over to the Mayan Palace at least once. The shuttle - basically a large/extended golf cart - leaves every half-hour. It makes a stop at the Mayan Palace lobby and either continues to the pool, or you get off and wait for whatever shuttle is necessary depending on where you're going (shuttles are color-coded and there's a diagram telling which color goes where). Really the only challenge we had with them is sometimes being stranded at the Mayan Palace lobby waiting for the Ocean Breeze shuttle since it tended to sit at the Ocean Breeze and wait. If you notify any of the other shuttle drivers that are dropping off at the lobby that you're waiting for the OB shuttle they'll radio the driver to come get you. The drive is pretty quick, maybe 10 minutes total to get to the pool. Spa - We used the spa for their sunburn treatment and it was fabulous. Staff were very friendly and caring. We booked our appointment about two hours ahead. I'm not quite sure what time they close, but we took a 8p appointment, so they're open pretty late. Additionally, we received a 20% discount on our services. I don't know exactly why, maybe because it was later in the evening?, but it was unexpected. Balche - Pool restaurant at the Mayan, changes name to Frida's after 6p. We orded from the restaurant every day at the pool and the food was very good. The shrimp cocktail was simply *amazing*. I wish we had discovered it earlier in the week because I would have eaten it every day. The portion sizes are pretty big, and I ended up sharing with my husband for must lunches. Dinner at Frida's was pretty decent as well. The guacamole was good and I had pork and mango tacos that were pretty tasty. Swim up bars - service was great, staff friendly, drinks good! What more can you ask for? They open at 11a and typically there's a happy hour from then until 1p. Del Lago - Located in the Mayan complex. We ate there for their \"seafood\" buffet. By far the most disappointing thing about the hotel, hands down. The buffet was fairly expensive and definitely not worth it. The restaurant is located on a pond (hence the \"lago\") and is open-air. We were absolutely eaten alive by mosquitos. We convinced our waiter to light the citronella candle sitting on the table, but it barely made a dent. We went there primarily for seafood, and were extremely disappointed to see that the seafood basically included a make-your-own-ceviche bar, shrimp kabobs, and some kind of white fish. So not worth the money. The rest of the food was decent, desserts were also a little disappointing. A show of some sort was going to happen around 8p (I don't know if that happens every night), but were getting attacked by the bugs and couldn't deal with it. Tips: - You do have to sign for everything if you're anywhere off OB property. If you're at the pool or swim-up bar, ask to keep the tab open. - Request beer to come in a bucket to save everyone time - If your stay is all-inclusive, make sure that what you're signing says \"unlimited experience\" - There is signage everywhere that says that cash is not allowed at the resort - everything is charged to your room. Additionally, look at the bill and it will say if a gratuity is added or not (15%). We ended up tipping in addition to that because the service was so great, regardless of their policy. Also - because you're not signing for anything at the OB restaurant, we didn't know if tip was really added into it, so we always made sure to tip for everything. - If you decide to rent a palapa, they refund the charge if you eat dinner somewhere in the Mayan complex restaurants that same day. If you're all inclusive, basically, eat anywhere other Frida's. - If you're going on any excursions - the Mayan complex only allows pick up from private tours at the security gates. Many excursions are aware of this and since the OB is so new, we were often told to just go to the security gates for pick up. Make sure to let the excursion know that they ARE allowed to enter the Ocean Breeze gate and pick you up at the lobby. - Request to stay on the third floor as you'll at least get a decent view above the trees! General thoughts: Yes, the hotel isn't on the beach, and yes, it's rather small...but it's quiet and relaxing! After the chaos of the Mayan complex during the day, the place was a welcome respite. The hotel is probably not for families if you're looking for socialization, but it was absolute wonderful to retire to after a long day in the sun. Also, the entire complex is absolutely huge. Everyone has to take the shuttle to get anywhere - the building closest to us at the Mayan Palace was only two minutes away via shuttle - we at least had our own pool and restaurant located just downstairs. It's the best of both worlds since you get to use all the amenities of the Mayan complex!!

But I ended up being pleasantly surprised. The hotel is brand new, and sparkling clean, nice modern decor. The room was really nice, although the view was just of some bushes. As said in other reviews, most of the amenities are a short (but fun) golf cart ride away at the Mayan Palace - one of the all-inclusive restaurants, the enormous pool, an absolutely beautiful beach with cool sofa/bed furniture (although not too good for swimming). A lot of people on this website were complaining about the little Ocean Breeze pool, but I thought it was nice. It even had changing color lights at night. The people staying at the Mayan Palace also had to take golf carts to get to their rooms, which were just as far away as ours. But they didn't have a pool, deli, and restaurant close to their rooms, like us :) The Ocean Breeze pool restaurant had really good food. The guacamole was amazing, and each night they had a station with different choices for the guy to cook right in front of you. The calamari was fresh and delicious. They also had a wide assortment of desserts to choose from every night, at least 10 different ones. The service was extremely good. Everyone was very nice and helpful. For example, it says the last golf cart shuttle is at 10:45, (things shut down at 11) but when we wanted to go to the beach after that, they said it was no problem and called the shuttle to take us, and the driver said just get a security guard to radio him whenever we were ready to go back. People were still in the pool at this time too! The only thing that was kind of annoying was having to sign for everything, but everyone had to sign, including the Mayan Palace guests. Overall, I would say Ocean Breeze is a good deal. It was trickily misrepresented by bookit.com, which I notice has now taken down the picture of the Mayan Palace pool as the main picture for Ocean Breeze. By reading all the reviews here, I had prepared myself for the worst. But the service was good, food was good, the shuttle wasn't bad at all, the room was nice, and everything was clean. We went at Easter time, when all the hotels were booked up and charging high rates. I would have preferred to stay at my favorite resort (Grand Sunset Princess), but by no means am I upset or sorry that I had to stay at Ocean Breeze.

When we pulled into the resort, there were questions about \"Is this even it???\" by others in the van and even the driver of the transportation vehicle. The \"resort hotel\" that is being advertised is NOTHING like where we were to stay. It looked like the back entrance to an out-building (perhaps a laundry center). The pools, restaurants, ocean, beach, etc were a mile away. The \"deli\" restaurant was an empty display case. The \"pool on site\" was about the size of our living room. There was transportation to the amenities every 20-30 minutes, but, we were definitely mislead by the representation of the hotel. The very nice woman at the desk said that many of the people who were arriving through CheapCarribbean dot com booking service had been very disappointed by what they found. As we stood in the lobby, other people there to check in were also upset. The resort that you expect is far from what people find when they get there. We called and booked into a different resort in Tulum (about an hour away) for an additional $250 + $40 for cab fare, The Grand Principe Tulum - which is exactly the type of resort we were interested in.

Let me prefice this review with the insight that this is NOT the first vacation I've taken in Mexico, also not the first in this location, or the first all-inclusive. Therefore, I can say with pride--if you're looking for a real GET AWAY--from other expansive resorts, nearly kid-free (even though I love 'em) and a real chance to get in touch with the natural Mexico...then book your stay at Ocean Breeze. ATMOSPHERE: This is a hotel that is purely \"hotel\". Do not come here expecting that your stay will be filled with fake pyramids and ruins, seventeen connecting pools, and hoards of fellow American, Canadian and some European travelers. However, if you ARE interested in having a taste of that...rest assured! The Mayan Palace is right down the road. Only YOU hold a free ticket to that adventure. This hotel was just opened for two weeks when we arrived. It is filled with a clean, crisp, \"breeze\"-like feeling. It's quiet, yes. Who wouldn't want that on vacation? It feels like a summer backyard. Just enough people to not make it claustrophobic nor boring. There is one pool on the premise. One stop dining-breakfast and dinner buffets. And exposure to the amenities of the Mayan Palace which include: two pool bars and the Balche Restaurant. Your All-Inclusive works at all of these locations. It's quaint, it is pleasant and it's a slice of home-like comfort away from home. SERVICE and FOOD: I feel like these almost go hand in hand. The staff at OB puts most hotels to shame. They are SOOO accomodating. We had a server for dinner, Ivan, who remembered not only our faces, our names, but our drink orders! He was so ontop of his game, it felt like a private restaurant. The managerial staff here is also not your typical managerial staff. They were always on hand to help their fellow workers. The dinner manager made it a habit of finding out what we had on the grill, and bringing it to our table while we hit up the salad bar. Exactly what you'd call ABOVE AND BEYOND. Jorge, our bellhop, was such a considerate and ontop of it man. We could call on him for anything and he always had a smile on his face. Even Maria, who attended to the room, made sure everything was in order without disturbing our things. The food was incredible. We had been warned that the food wouldn't be very exciting and sure to get boring as the week progressed. Being all-inclusive, we feared that this would be true. NOT THE CASE. The food was ideal for breakfast lovers. The basics, and then all the fixings of the extensive breakfast one could ask for. The dinner was always, ALWAYS, always incredible. Usually themed nights-Asian, Italian, Mexican ;). We also had access to seafood, which one would think would be accessible. However, guests from other resorts informed us of their disapointment in limited to no seafood selections. Every night they blew us away downstairs with the variety. Cannot speak enough of how much this food sets other resorts apart. Additionally, a family wandered up to the OB for dinner and didn't realize it was all-inclusive. However, once they saw the buffet the family of five decided to pay the $12 each and receive all the food they could desire. I watched them enjoy their meal...I cannot articulate enough how--no matter who you are--this is quality food. As for lunch--great options down at Balche and similar poolside options at OB. Did get a little same-same...but very little to complain! THE WOES or WHATEVERS of the GOLF CART TRANSPORTATION Yes, transportation is probably the only thing lacking here--if you know what you're getting into. The OB is located about 15 min walk from the Mayan Palace. The golf carts that drive you to and from these locations are few and far between. Not sure why--but we have stated this to the hotel as well. However, there are ways around this situation. First of all, it's gorgeous and a pleasant walk home if you have legs. Second of all, if you hate to walk for 15mins a day--hop on the carts taking residents of the condos and say you're getting off at building 19. You're walk will be cut in half. You will have to buy bug spray if you intend on walking after 5pm. However, it's really a good thing to have on hand anyway. The bugs are always out at night. ALL THE FUSS? If you are looking for something off the beaten path--this is a great stay. And for someone who doesn't want to spend 24 7 at their hotel, this lends itself to all the great benefits of the all-inclusive stay, the limited amount of guests, and ability to explore the surroundings a little. See the actual Mexican landscape as the newly planted trees and fauna are popping up for us to enjoy. The fact that there are such small numbers here is an asset to couples-young or old. Families may not enjoy this location as much because you have to make it a point to get to the Palace and to socialize with the children there. There is no beach worth swimming in this location as it shares access to a rocky beach at the Mayan Palace. However, if you speak with the Olympus Tour manager in the lobby he will give you great advice on how to get to a beautiful beach, private beach, or how to include one on one of your excursions! (HIGHLY RECOMMEND EXCURSIONS! ATV rides, Mayan Adventure, explore Tulum for 2hrs package, and zipline!). Overall, this is a great homebase. It's so relaxing to return after a full day poolside at the Mayan, or after a five hour snorkling adventure, or a day of seeing the sights to a quiet and beautiful hotel. To be served by kind and friendly wait staff and to sit at the pool enjoying your wine and the full moon. It's a real experience here.
