He helped in converting my dollars and on the last day when i wanted to buy turkish delights, he walked with me to the shop and got the delights for me. The breakfast and other amneties were perfect. The location and hospitality is the best part of the hotel. Their new hotel: Sultan's Royal which will be inaugurated next week is another jewel in this neighbourhood which is just 2 minutes away from Tashkonak.

We travel as a couple and not with a group. However we had been to Europe before and know for a fact that in the range of price we were looking for the rooms are small. We needed space for a 7 day stay. That is how by looking through the reviews on trip Advisor we found the Taskonak Hotel and the Tashknonak Suites and Apartment which is situated in the Sultanahmet district. We looked at the photos and decided on a room in the Suites. The one we wanted was available for a very good price for 7 days. It included the transport from the Airport Ataturk to the hotel wich was the best thing we could ask for. Someone was waiting at the Airport with our name on a sign, could'nt have been better. We made our reservations through internet and got a confirmation within 24 hours. On arrival at the suite it was exactly what we had been looking at on Internet. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable and had a little kitchen counter to make ourselves coffee. We had seating chairs and a small desk to do Internet. There was space and the bathroom was big. This Hotel and the Suites are situated within walking distance of the most important tourist attractions. In fact you have everything you need within 5 minutes walks such as restaurants, busses, tram, grocery store, ATM in Euros or Liras. Every morning we would go to the Hotel to have our breakfast on the rooftop. Then of with our day of visiting. All the staff, everyone of them, although some of them didn't even speak english, were polite and seemed to love the work they were doing. Every day coming back to the hotel was like coming home and having someone take interest in what you did. We didn't have to go to the tourist office the hotel was doing a great job. When we go back to Istanbul, and we will, this will be our hotel.
