My flight landed in Amsterdam at 7am and I took the train into Amsterdam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central station. From there is an easy 15 minute walk to the hotel. (One tip: if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only going to be in Amsterdam for a night or two and have a lot of luggage, put your bag in a luggage locker at the airport (6 Euro per day) and just take a small bag into Amsterdam. This is what I did and it was great.) The Jordaan district, where the hotel is located, is really lovely with nice shops, pubs, restaurants and is central but quiet. After a leisurely stroll through Jordaan, I got to the hotel around 9am. Luckily my room had already been vacated and I only had to wait about 20 minutes for them to clean it. They gave me the option of dropping my bag in the room and heading out or having a cup of tea while I waited for them to clean. I waited and my room was available within the 20 minutes they had promised. When I got to my room it was basically as I expected based on the reviews I had read on this site. It was a small clean room with a tiny closet, a fairly comfy chair, two small tables and a bed. It is spartan and basic but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need anything else. The best feature is a clean, private bathroom. (Trust me, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to share a bathroom in a budget hotel in Amsterdam.)

The breakfast is fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a few slices of bread, hardboiled egg, slice of cheese and ham and tea or coffee. Service is pleasant and quick. Overall, this hotel is a good deal for a single traveler. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you could find anything better for 45 Euro a night in such a great neighborhood. They charge 45 Euro per person regardless of how many people share the room (i.e. 90 for a double and 135 for a triple).

The hotel is in the quiet and lovely Jordaan district, close to the Anne Frank museum and a few excellent restaurants. The staff seemed a bit rigid, but helpful if asked for information. Our room at the back was very quiet with large picture windows. The tired bathroom was generally always flooded after a shower (bring your own soap - we never got any from the maid). The beds were dorm-like, but surprisingly pretty comfortable. It was easy to use the tram (Westermarkt - take #14 from the train station) and there is a Bike City rental shop on the same block. The nearby Pancake Bakery is unique and very good (expect a wait and neutral service) and Cafe Restaurant de Reiger is excellent with a brown cafe feel to it (although they have a non-smoking section at the front).", "Date": "November 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, England", "Title": "\u201cQuirky and charming\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4077726", "Content": "The hotel is a pleasant walk from the central station and on arrival we were made welcome and I can confirm the hotel is gay friendly.

Breakfast was a large continental with boiled egg, and choice of Teas or coffee, cream or milk. All served in a spacious dining area by friendly staff. The bedroom was basic but very comfortable and clean with a private shower room and toilet with fresh towels daily. The Hotel is very close to a lot of wonderful cafes/bars frequented by the locals with great menus including the famous Pancake restaurant just up from the Anne Frank Museum.

It is ideally situated, very close to Centraal Station (about 20min walk or 10min tram & walk), Anne Frank House (2min) and tram stops (4min). The mattresses are wafer thin, but that is our only complaint. Everything is super clean. Our room overlooked the canal and we sat by the window, drinking wine and enjoying Amsterdam's atmosphere after a day of sightseeing. The reviewer that complained about the shower curtain is ignorant about the fact that a lot of bathrooms in the Netherlands are of a open design. Loek do not provide soap, due to environmental concerns, but will supply if asked. The cash only policy is unusual but cannot distract from the excellent value of 40euro per person.
