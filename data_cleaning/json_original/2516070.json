They have a big pigeon problem and have the spikes all over the place, but my room was missing some and there were three birds nesting outside the window which was very noisy and not a pleasant noise. Someone had removed the screen from the window and was trying to the block where the pigeons were nesting but it didn't help. The location is on a busy street and there was a lot of activity.

Just a place with lots of blue collar businesses (garages, mercados, etc.) around it. It's easy to find and easy access to the highway. Treat this nice place as your base camp for exploring LA.

Like Lostn Transit I didn't want to spend $180 a night plus $18 for parking at the hotel near Universal Studios so I decided to stay at this Best Western. My wife, my two kids, and I had a car so I didn't mind staying at this location, and we weren't going to stay out too late anyway. The hotel is in an industrial part of town as the reviewers say. I personally didn't think the location was as bad that some people made it out to be. Anyway, to get into the rooms of the hotel you would have to walk by the lobby/front desk. It's not a motel where you just park outside and walk to your door. Parking is inside and underneath the hotel and from there you walk to the lobby to get to all rooms. The rooms are clean and the beds are decent. This place is probably at most 2 years old so everything looks fairly new (except for the worn towels). Instead of curtains, they have shutters. There is a minifridge, microwave, AC/fan, and 27\" flat screen TV. The complimentary breakfast was decent. It had the basic danishes, bread, muffins, hard boiled eggs or scrambled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, and OJ. Also you can make your own waffles but there might be a line for that. One of the complaints I had was that the shower head was one of those low flow ones, so you can't take a super quick shower. However, probably because of the low flows, there is always super hot water even during the morning rush (which even at nicer hotels is problematic). I also thought that the small hair dryer was a little weaker than the normal small hairdryers found at these hotels. Parking can be a problem but I was lucky to park on the side where you are not blocked for 2 nights. The other night I parked on the doubles side where you can get blocked. I did get blocked but in the morning the front desk person was able to move the truck out for me to get out. (You have to leave your key at the front desk if you are parking on the doubles side and are on the outside blocking some other vehicle). Universal Studios is about a 20-25 minute drive. Hollywood is probably another 10 minutes away. There is a Ralph's and CVS which is about a 2 minute drive. I wouldn't stay here without a car. I didn't see the buses at all so the wait is probably quite long.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNo complaints - 3 nights spent Feb. 2012\u201d", "Author": "LostinTransit10", "ReviewID": "UR125010452", "Content": "Just finished three nights at the Best Western Burbank Airport hotel. I was traveling in LA with a larger group. They were staying at a Universal City hotel that was $180+. a night plus $18. for parking. That was more than what I wanted to spend, so I elected to save the $ and say a \"short\" distance away. The front desk staff was great all three times I encountered them. The room was very clean. In fact, I am not sure how old this building is, but based on the condition of my room, I would guess less than a year. All the furnishing/bath/bed were in excellent shape. The room was much larger than most I stay in. If the was one minus, it was that I could here TV and kids voices through the walls between about 8 and 11 pm. I always travel with ear plugs to I used them. That managed to block out about 90% of the noise - enough to fall asleep. I had a car, so I did not walk anywhere in the area surrounding the hotel. I had looked at it using google maps before I made the reservation and could tell based on experience that It would not be healthy for me to venture out. I drove into the under building parking lot each evening and drove out again the following morning. If I were you, I would plan on doing the same. I felt very safe driving to and from the hotel. The parking is free. The continental breakfast was OK. Also free. I paid under $90. per night (including tax). It was worth every penny. Finally, the trip up from Universal City in the evening was a short 10-15 minutes drive. From the hotel to Universal City in morning rush hour was a tense 40 minutes in bumper to bumper, stop and go traffic. The pic of the room does not do it justice.

He is from England, and I live in the southern United States. We chose this location because it appeared to be fairly centrally located to Universal and Warner Brothers studios, which were among our top destinations, and was also close to the local Metro station (yes, we used publc transportation rather than renting a car). First of all, as described by other reviewers, the hotel is located in an industrial, working class area, with a predominately Hispanic population. We are two white guys and stood out like sore thumbs. Admittedly, at first I was somewhat uneasy with the location simply because I knew nothing about the area or how its residents would react to us. However, my fears were quickly allayed the first night. We walked, in the dark, down the street to Jimmy's Burgers. Not only were we not bothered by anyone, the staff at Jimmy's were very friendly and served us a delicious and much appreciated meal. That broke the ice for me, and from that point on, we just blended into the neighborhood, whether it was shopping for groceries at Superior or getting a quick snack across the street at 7-Eleven. Everywhere where we went, we were polite and courteous and treated everyone with respect, and that is what we received in return. My advice to anyone staying in this hotel is to have no fear. The residents of this neighborhood are nice people. Be cautious, as you should anywhere, but don't judge the area soley by its appearance. As for the hotel, I booked through priceline, com. My room, like previous reviewer Brittany, faced the preschool next door. It did become noisy after 9AM, but shutting the window suppressed most of the noise, and we were usually gone sightseeing by 10AM, so that really was not a bother. The room itself was very clean, spacious, and well-appointed with a massive king sized bed that was very comfortable. Unlike others, we had no problem with the breakfast. Depending on the time, it could be very crowded or practically dead. They menu offered hard-boiled eggs every day, except weekends which had scrambled eggs. Self serve waffles were available every day, as was toast, danish and muffins, four different cereals (2 sweet, 2 healthier), fruit, coffee, teas, and juices. My partner ate in the breakfast room every day. I'm a late sleeper, so I usually went up for my meal about 8:30 and carried a plate back to my room, an alternative for those who find it too small, warm, or crowded. Breakfast is complimentary, and you have a mini-fridge to keep leftovers. We had no problems with any of the staff. All of the housekeeping ladies were friendly and very efficient. We had fresh towels every day without asking. Most of the desk clerks were helpful, the two standouts being Juan (morning clerk) and the gentleman who worked the afternoon/early evening shift. In short, the property was clean, spacious, and a good value for our needs. I would defintely stay there again should I return. Other hotels in the area were much pricier and not necessarily any safer. Personally, we enjoyed being a small part of the neighborhood along Metro line 224. For us, blending into the culture rather than standing apart from it as mere tourists is the way to go.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cAffordable, Clean, & Practical\u201d", "Author": "shangot", "ReviewID": "UR121617728", "Content": "We needed a hotel to stay the night to catch an early flight in the morning.

The other reviews stated it wasn't so bad. Ok, so why do all the buildings around have bars on the windows and very high fences around their property? It is a bad area, and there are gang signs on the property just across the street. The majority of parking is tandem so if you have to park blocking another car you have to turn in your car keys to the clerk at the desk. Not so terrible unless you happen to be blocked in by a person who did not turn in their car keys or leave any information of who the car belongs to. This happened on our very first night. We came back to the hotel around 10 in the evening and a couple were trying to leave. A very large SUV was blocking their car and no one at the hotel knew who it belong to and did not have the keys. They finally were able to move all the cars on both sides and slowly inch their way out but it made me very wary of being parked there after that. Now the breakfast room. It is on the third floor, heat rises correct? Well it is the exact size of the hotel room. The bedroom is all the seating there is and all the food is in what is the size of the bathroom. All the hot appliances, coffee pot, waffle maker, toaster are all going with no AC vent, no fan, nothing to cool the room off. It had to be 110 degrees in there.

We arrived at 4pm and checked in without any line or hassles. The room was fantastic! It was big (the bathroom was HUGE) and had plantation shutters with a window we could actually open (I love fresh air in hotel rooms). The television was a big flat screen and we brought our dvd player to hook up to it. We also brought our laptop since they had FREE wifi! It only took us 10 minutes to get to the Magic Castle in West Hollywood. We noticed Universal City is super close to the hotel (we passed exits for Universal Studios within 3 minutes of driving). Upon arriving back at the hotel (around 2am) the parking garage was near capacity. There was one spot available on the double car side, so we had to drop our keys at the front desk so that they could move our car if the person parked in front of us needed to get out. This was basically the only con of our trip. I do not feel comfortable leaving our ONE keypad to our brand new car with a complete stranger in Los Angeles. Oh well, though!

It wasn't the best area but not scary by any means. I guess I was just expecting more shops instead of small grocery marts. The plus side is that it is very close to Universal Studios and there are several fast food restaurants if you want a quick bite to eat. The guy at the front desk was very helpful. We got in a little later but didn't want to stay couped up in the hotel room. He suggested we go to a mall nearby which was actually a great mall! The room had everything we needed, it was very clean and you can tell it was just newly renovated. The hotel also had a great continental breakfast and we found that the staff were really nice and polite. When we checked out I accidently left my leather jacket in the closet (actually my FAVORITE leather jacket!!). I called a few hours later when I realized I left it and inquired about it. The front desk already knew about it and suggested they can send the jacket to me by mail and just charge my credit card for the shipping cost. I received my jacket about 3.5 weeks later in the same condition and it only cost me $7 for the shipping as opposed to buying a new leather jacket for $300! Overall, we thought this hotel was great! It was a great value, close to attractions, staff were accomodating and polite, and rooms were new and clean.

This hotel was recently renovated so it was very nicely decorated and had no major maintenance issues. The breakfast was decent but the breakfast room was tiny (there were only 4 tables) and got over-crowded very quickly. The parking situation was weird and there wasn't nearly enough. On one side of the lot were stalls 1 car length deep. If you could get one one of those spots every night you were fine. On the other side of the lot stalls were 2 car lengths deep. If you got to a stall first you were blocked in by the second car and had to wait for it to be moved if you needed to leave. If you got there second you either had to give your keys to the front desk or come down and move the car yourself when the front desk called. Then there was the fruit. Apparently the people in the room previously had left some fruit on a shelf and it rolled back to be hidden from view. The cleaning staff missed it and it began to rot. When I noticed it I reported it to the front desk and asked for it to be cleaned up during the daily room cleaning. When I got back that evening it still had not been done. To his credit, the front desk guy got some cleaning supplies and cleaned it up, but he shouldn't have had to.

First, it should be said that there is little to look at in this area. It's located on Lankershim which features great accessibility to attractions that (thankfully) saves you from entering the highway system. Unfortunately, the area it is located in is a decidedly less nice location. Late at night, you don't have to go very far to see prostitutes on corners and some shady dealings. This doesn't mean you're risking your life to stay here, but if you're bringing a family with small children (we're all well old enough), then the area is probably not the best. The front desk was incredibly accommodating and got to know us after frequently seeing us in and out everyday. The breakfast is pretty typical hotel fare; nothing special. The room itself, however, had good and bad about it. On the one hand, it was clear the hotel was new. Walls, carpets, beds, and all felt fresh and unruined. The windows inside the room (large slat-like blinds) were very nice to see upon entering, but having spent several days, you begin to see little things that cheapen the room; this mainly deals with the actual construction. Our room, for example, featured a bathroom door that would not properly close (the doorjam wasn't built at the correct depth), floor molding that gradually separated from the carpet along the wall (it went from having no gap near the door, to nearly a half-inch gap in the other corner), broken remote controls (you would have to hold it upside down and at an angle to get it to work), and a broken door sensor. The sensor was annoying, very much so. If your door happens to not close all the way, a loud beeping noise emits to make you aware to close the door. Unfortunately, any time we left or entered the room, this sensor would go off regardless of whether the door was closed. We told the front desk and they gave us a flimsy \"it's supposed to do that\" excuse (this only occurred with one of the other couples). It was annoying coming home late to listen to the noise for those several seconds and, seeing as one of us fell ill in the room, it would constantly awaken anyone trying to sleep in the bedroom. All in all, these were small inconveniences that I feel could be improved to make an average stay even better. As is, it's not a terrible place to stay and the only legitimate complaint I found was the area it was built in. If that's not an issue for people, then there's no reason to not stay, really.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Surprise\u201d", "Author": "COnative31", "ReviewID": "UR73333714", "Content": "We were a late arrival and were very apprehensive about the location of the hotel once we got to the area.

Looks fairly secure for this area. Cons: Honestly, it is like someone took a beautiful hotel, picked it up and plopped it smack in the middle of a very questionable area. The security cameras in the lobby kind of give it away. Now, we had absolutely no problems here any d we found everyone to be friendly and helpful. But, my \"mom radar\" was in high alert upon check in. I certainly would not feel safe walking around at night in this neighborhood. I think I see why the room was so cheap now. Also, although they give you a free breakfast, there is a very small breakfast room and many food items were left completely uncovered and unrefrigerated for several hours....especially an uncovered plate of hard boiled eggs...no refrigeration and no cover.
