She had all of the appropriate confirmation information regarding her trip. Her flight, however, was going to arrive in the evening on the date of her check-in. The front office here informed her that they close at 9pm. First of all, what kind of establishment located in Daytona Beach closes that early? The Motel 6 in Paris, Ohio is open for check-in all night, for crying out loud. Second of all, what kind of establishment closes that early in the height of tourist season? This reservation was set for mid-July, 2012. Magnanimously, the office agreed to keep someone there until 930pm, but if my sister arrived after that time, they would leave a key to her room. I am happy to report, they did, at least, do that much. However, when my sister went up to that room, there were two other women already settled in it. After much discussion and debate, the group was able to get ahold of the Pirate's Cove's owner, who, at that moment, informed my sister that 2 days prior she had taken that room's rental off the market. There was no contact, courteous or otherwise, which informed her of this. She found out WHEN SHE ARRIVED IN HER ROOM, and only after this little dispute forced a call to the owner. So, needless to say, you can make a reservation here. You may even get a confirmation of that reservation. However, they may decide to pull that rug out from under you at any time, even as little as 2 days before you're departing for your vacation, AND THEY MAY NOT EVEN TELL YOU ABOUT IT. This is NOT the way I would like to be treated if I'm planning a trip to Daytona, whether I were alone or with a family of six. Think about that before calling or clicking.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elmira, New York", "Title": "\u201cWorth it!

Consider these qualifications: There's no daily maid service. Do you really need this? There's no complimentary breakfast. With what you're saving, you can treat yourself to breakfast out every day ... OR ... you can make your own coffee and a quick breakfast using the small efficiency kitchen. The room is a bit older, in need of some sprucing up, including paint. Chances are, unless you've gone through a remodel at home in the last five years, this place may be in better repair than your own home. If I were to stay here again, I would bring drawer liners for the dresser and extra towels, including mat, for the bath. Bed is comfy, and AC is in tip-top shape. Pool is HUGE and awesome. Parking lot is well-lit and secure. Definitely a no-frills vacation for us. The price was VERY right, even if the space took a bit of getting used to.

Our room (514) was a little rough around the edges, but we made it work. Everything in the room was older, so it seemed \"dirty.\" We just picked up some cleaner and wiped everything down ourselves and felt fine about the room after that. The room had tile, so this was nice. We didn't have to worry about nasty carpet. Everything worked in the kitchen area, so we were able to cook meals rather than eating out. The pots and pans were minimal, but okay. There were cups, plates and silverware, but we went a bought disposable because there was no dishwasher and we didn't want to spend all week washing dishes. The beds we definately needed to be upgraded, but were clean and after being exhausted from the beach all day were fine. Shower had good pressure, so no complaints there. The pool area was nice enough. The pool is not heated, but we were at the beach most of the time, so it didn't bother us. We loved have a private balcony. We wish the pool would have been lit, so we could have enjoyed the pool area after dark when the beach wasn't available. The A/C in our room also needed updating, but kept the room comfortable, but not cold like we normally would like it. You could tell this place use to be happening, but just needs some TLC now. It was also quiet... we were there over Spring Break and there was no craziness to speak of. If you are expecting 5 stars for $500 for 7 nights, come on, you're an idiot. We would stay again, I think we would just try to have them find us a room that is a little more updated.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "Vera145", "ReviewID": "UR126937640", "Content": "We will be returning to this privately owned unit (#423).
