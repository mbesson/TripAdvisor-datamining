Room was so small, if you have 1 suitcase you have to climb over the bed to access the other side of the room. Thus enabling you to peer through the filthy window to the street below. 4, Bathroom = Shower unable to keep constant temperature, lighting inadequate and worked randomly when tapped repeatedly. Dirty. 5, Internet = Free if you can access it. However not being able to see or connect to the network does not in my eyes constitute free internet. Pathetic! 6, Reception on television very poor. 7, Continental breakfast = Joke! Toast, cornflakes, and offee. Where was the fresh fruit, maybe a croissant or pastry? Pathetic.

Everywhere we stayed was booked ahead and pre-paid. This was our only bad experience. First off, we were told breakfast was 7:30 to 10:30 in the morning. I will return to this point. Upon registering, we only received the magnetic key entry--nothing else. We deposited our luggage in our room. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. We returned to the front desk to ask where we could find a pub for supper. \"Up past the turnabout\" was the response. We set out walking--we ended up picking up snacks from a corner store, never did find a pub... We were afraid to walk on the carpet in bare feet--dirty, and covered with burn marks from an iron. Who knows what was lurking in amongst those fibres. One of the beds was jammed up against the window which looked out onto a dirty yard full of garbage. The window was open, and there were several flies buzzing around the room which we were unable to send to a better place. Although the sheets were clean, there was no mattress pad between me and the mattress, and I still have a bite that hasn't healed now 5 days later. We went for breakfast just before 9:25 am. We were abruptly told that breakfast was over. I asked for a bun or croissant, nope, nothing, breakfast is over. Upon attending to the front desk, I was told to consult the card that I had NOT been given the night before. It was shoved into my face, and emphasized that the card distinctly said that breakfast was over at 9:30. It didn't seem to matter a whit that I didn't get that card, or that I was told 10:30. When I asked for a refund of the breakfast, all that the manager would say is \"Not my problem\". So we were out the cost of our breakfast in addition to a lousy night's sleep. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy!! This place has no customer service, and no respect. The cab driver who picked us up and took us to the airport also said, very politely, that this place does not have a very good reputation.

Location: about 5 minutes walk from the Shepherds bush station - although it took me over 30 minutes to locate the place as i went in the opposite direction. The Holland park roundabout near the station is what confused me so please take very good note of the directions on your map. Reception: A sullen looking receptionist - i think the hotel is an Algerian owned one (due to the predominant algerian tv stations) was there and gave me my room key and told me breakfast was at 7.30 Room: on entering the room i was pleasantly surprised due to the terrible reviews i had read. the bathroom had a musty smell- i had the unfortunate experience of being allocated a basement room - but the room was quite clean. the bedspread smelled freshly washed. there was a lcd tv on the wall as well as a microwave and a mini fridge which was really handy. But there are no Wardrobes there though, just spaces. the carpet was a little worn out and curtain really dirty. I also took my bedsheets because of the horrible stories i read about BED Bugs and i can vouch that i felt some biting me although i did not find any! Strange-maybe my mind played tricks with me. WORST PART: NO RECEPTION on my mobile in the basement room so make it clear to your agent or the hotel before paying or accepting the room that you do not want the basement room - unless of course you don't intend to make or receive mobile phone calls. internet though is free and very good and quick throughout the hotel. BREAKFAST: terrible and extremely small range of choices, basically just bread and cereals! and a couple of hard boiled eggs. that was it and really they shouldn't call it a buffet breakfast due to the extremely limited choices!

The hotel was darling and oh so good priced when I went there to stay last year. (I escaped from York House hotel which I originally had reservations with, to this one, and felt as if I had gone from hell to Heaven. The funny thing was, when I told the man at Kensington's front desk about this, he looked at me pointedly, and asked, \"York House Hotel? 27-28 Philbeach Gardens?\" It turns out that he and his partners had previously owned York House Hotel before selling it, to the God-awful people that now ru(i)n it. And then he was kind of sad. We both were.) The room I had was a nonsmoking double used as a single, and it was completely, spotlessly clean, which for there being a kitchenette in the room and for my standards, takes some responsible human beings to do. It was indeed small, and kind of hard to move around in, but all you needed was there. The kitchenette included a microwave , a mini fridge (Godsend when you are trying to save money when traveling!), sink, dishes and utensils, detergent, and teabags and coffee and kettle. The owner even had the thoughtfulness to put up a plank of wood on top of the bed so you can put your books, eyeglasses, cups, and whatnots there. There were overhead reading lights, too. The bathroom was fine. Everything looked pretty new, and was clean. The bed was comfortable, the sheets and cover new and clean. Something else worth mentioning--I stayed in a nonsmoking room cluster, and during my first night my neighbor (also nonsmoking room) started smoking, which was beginning to make me sick. I went down to the receptionist to gripe, and the nice, and somewhat boisterous Indian man made the smoking neighbor come out to apologize to me. :) I loved this place, and thought I might have found my own little spot, when I go to London; it's kind of heartbreaking for me to see all these bad reviews now, becuase it held a darling little place in my heart.

The service was also very good, with my bed being made everyday, room tidied and vaccumed and clean towels everyday. However the inside of the toilet bowl could have done with some cleaning....The man on reception was very helpful, he even let me print from the printer free of charge. Breakfast was nothing special, but sufficient! Eggs, toast, cereal, milk, orange juice, jam, tea and coffee. The location of the hotel was excellent, very close to shops, pubs and the underground. Although they told me Kensington Olympia was the closest train, it is an Overground train, and doesn't come as often. Shepherds Bush Underground is almost as close, and much more convenient as it is on the Central line with trains coming and going every few minutes, and will connect you to anywhere! The hotel is about 5-10 mins walk to Westfield London in one direction, and High Street Kensington in the other direction! In saying all of this, there were a few negative things, such as the annoying card to get into the room (instead of a key) that decided to stop working sometimes. It was annoying staying in the room with reception right above me as I heard everyone as they came in and out. Also the tv came on by itself every morning.

I had a room booked at the Kensington Suite Hotel (Formerly the Westfield Suite Hotel) for 3 nights, which I had chosen based on the fact that it had 3* facilities and what appeared to be cosy rooms that looked rather lovely for the price, and that it was in an ideal location which was quiet and fairly close to where I was working. Upon arrival at the hotel, I was greeted by a receptionist who took down my name and bank details, before informing me that I would not in fact be spending my first night at this hotel because there was a problem with my room. I asked reasonable questions such as where I would be sleeping, I was ignored and simply told \"another hotel. I call a cab now\"; was then sent across to Ascot Hotel in Paddington, where the cab driver had been instructed to hand an envelope to reception. I was left standing and waiting in reception for 20 minutes while the receptionist took a cig break and slowly dealt with a couple of people in front of me, and I was finally dealt with only to be informed that I'd been sent to the wrong hotel (before he resorted to having a good laugh about it with his colleague as if some sort of inside joke! Incredibly rude!) By now I was starting to feel rather wound up, as it was actually beginning to seem as though this was no more than an elaborate scam to take my money with no intention of providing a place to stay. So I was handed the envelope back and told I had to walk a few hundred yards down the road to another hotel, which was far from the 3* quality I was expecting during my stay, but perhaps a 1* - a cold family room that reminded me more of a bed-sit than any hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in! I called up the hotel to complain, and felt as though I was being spoken down to; basically the receptionist made this out to be no big deal, informing me that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only for one night\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the end I decided that this was too much of an inconvenience for me, as this also meant that I would have to cart my luggage across London during rush hour trying to switch locations in time to get over to work for 9AM, and I managed to make alternative arrangements. I was promised a refund that night, which three days later I am still waiting on. I have no clue what the rooms in the hotel were like, but the level of customer service I received was shocking and I can only imagine how bad they treat guests when they actually stay at the hotel!", "Date": "July 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Telford", "Title": "\u201cTiny!\u201d", "Author": "Tooley1988", "ReviewID": "UR13059851", "Content": "THE ROOM- was really tiny they put 3 beds in our room & if three people did sleep in the room it would of been very wrong because all the beds where next to each other. bathroom was really small you couldnt move around it at all & the shower was just about big enough to do a 360 in it. the whole time i was there they did not change my bed & did not take the rubbish out the room when i left in by the window. BREAKFAST- The breakfast was rubbish we asked for a full english the first day we was there & full english is defo not what you would call it. they gave us one sasuage & 1 bacon & the bacon was cold & sasuage was cheap. they gave us a handful of beans & a egg and all that took 25mins to come to us. the tables where rubbish because the chairs would not go under the table so you would have to have your legs to the side to sit down. THE HOTEL- the hotel if you could call it that, its just two old victorian house knocked into two & put as many rooms in as possible. It looked really nice when you walked in but if it was raining at any point then you would slip on the stairs going into the place as they were mable steps.

On the plus side it has been recently refurbished, so things are generally in a reasonable condition. The only real problem was breakfast which was a bit of a farce. To start with the size of the breakfast area is inadequate for the number of people staying. Assuming you get a seat, you will find that the tables were designed for vertically challenged people, but unfortunately the chairs were not. Therefore you will either have to remove your legs, or sit sideways on to the table. My advice at breakfast (eat out really) is to make sure you secure any glasses and cups you might need ASAP. I think they only have one small set of either, so you need to be quick if you are to avoid drinking your morning coffee out of a bowl.
