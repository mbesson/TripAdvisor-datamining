We got a Standard room and were surprised by the roominess of it, great size room, huge bathroom area, comfortable beds, rooms made up daily and most importantly (for tourists anyway), GREAT location, it's literally a few minutes walk to Hollywood Boulevard and transport. Although we didn't spend all day in the hotel, we both had a pleasant nights sleep each night. So if you're looking for somewhere comfortable to stay and base yourself from while you see the sights, without breaking the bank, I would recommend this place. Of course there were some things that could be improved, front desk staff always seemed too busy chatting on the phone or with friends to care too much; despite this though, they will help you with what you need if you ask for it! The rooms look a little dated, and could do with some minor maintenance, but nothing major. Overall, great value for money, with free wifi (ask front desk for pass key) and parking. Not to mention a fantastic location, walking distance to everything!

WHY?? OK, I am a person of size, meaning that the bathroom fixtures are WAY TOO SMALL. The shower, while ample in the curtain area still has its flaws. This hotel is not compliant in many ways, so if you need an elevator, forget it! Lots of steps. THe front desk attendents can be very helpful and for the most part polite. The woman who owns the place was there when I checked in and she told me the building was built in the 1930s. She was very nice as well. OK, so the place is not the Best Western or the Holiday inn, but it is not corperate owned either. I like to support independant business. And since this is only a place to sleep while out on the town, I will continue to stay here, Previously reviewed: I have now stayed here twice. As previous reviews have stated the location is EXCELLENT. My traveling partner and I wanted close to the Magic Castle and a decent room rate. That is what this basic \"no frills\" hotel has to offer. PROS: Location Decent size rooms and bathrooms decent quality bed. great \"budget\" price. CONS: Limited parking (lot was full when I pulled in late Saturday night and had to leave keys at front desk for consideration of other guests.) No bottled water or sugar free beverages in the nearly out of product vending machine. Not ADA complient. No elevator, lots of stairs and finally, their bookkeeping department! Re: bookkeeping: I reserved 2 nights (Friday night and Saturday night) departing Sunday morning. After being on the road 1/2 way home to the SF Bay area, I get a call from the hotel bookkeeper. \"You owe us for another night.\" she says. I told her we left at 11:00 am check out time, gave our keys to the housekeeping lady because the front desk guy was tending to something else. She then asks me to mail her or fax her my receipt when I got home as she did not have a copy of it. (WHAT? no reciept copy which I signed???) We hang up, she then calls me back (as I am driving) and then tells me she made a mistake and apologizes.

There were two double beds in the main room, with a chest of drawers containing a TV with lots of cable channels and there was a large table in the corner. No door to the bathroom but this never caused a problem the whole week we were there so don't let this startle you. The toilet did have a door and was at one end of the bathroom and the shower was large, and was very easy to use, it was great. The reception staff were always friendly and didn't mind looking after our passports the whole week (recommended) . The room was cleaned and beds made daily and towels were changed every other day and the maids were very friendly and even washed a towel for me i brought from home without me asking. Nothing went missing from our room at any point in the week. The room was basic, but this hotel is all about the location, its a 1-2 min walk from the main blvd which has the Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Fame. and a 3 min walk from the underground metro station which will get you everywhere you want to go for a very great price. Lots of great restaurants in the area including The Rolling Stone lounge, Hard Rock Cafe, California Pizza Kitchen, Boho (who do an AMAZING steak) and Hollywood Grill. Lots of other places to eat along hollywood blvd. All in all I highly recommend this hotel, the bad reviews must have been unlucky?

You can see the Hollywood sign from the Hollywood/Highland mall so make sure to snap some pictures there. Upon checking in, always examine the bed and sheets. I made a rather nasty discovery this time - there was a toenail in the sheets! I complained to the front desk and housekeeping came to change our sheets. The room was very spacious and there was a separate kitchenette and big bathroom. The decor is pretty dated (it's definitely a no frills hotel) and the room smelled strongly of bleach, and despite this the shower curtain was a bit mouldy. We attempted to air out the room and noticed that a few of the window latches were broken. Hotel maintenance has rectified this by welding bars on the outside over the broken windows so security wasn't too big an issue, and it was nice to be able to get some fresh air. The phone was not working so I had to make yet another complaint - however, this was fixed the next day. The hotel provides a decent free breakfast - you can have cereal, bagels, toast, muffins, juice, tea and coffee as you want. The staff were nice and were not offended by my complaints and did their best to fix any issues.

Hotel was VERY noisy & there was no safe & a little lock on the door which we didn\u2019t like. There was free & ample parking which was good. Overall a cheap hotel & we got what we paid for but if I went there again I wouldn\u2019t stay in Hollywood (Or in thgis hotel) I would stay out near the beach as much nicer safer area. This is the only hotel out of the 12 we stayed in on our trip that i would NOT recommed to a friend - a huge disappointment.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaga", "Title": "\u201cDon't bother to stay here\u201d", "Author": "DCFMalaga", "ReviewID": "UR20571133", "Content": "This is really an unpleasant area to stay, scruffy and untidy and this hotel fitted into this area well.

My room was very large for the price: kitchenette, sofa, king bed, digital cable, a closet, and a bathroom with a separate vanity area. The wireless worked well. My only complaint was that my remote wouldn't work with the TV and if I wanted to turn it on/off or adjust the volume I had to get up and do it manually.

We had originally booked into the Hollywood Hostel, but after hearing such terrible things about it, we booked in here a few days in advance. The staff are very friendly, helpful and accommodating, and we were actually charged less than we had been quoted. Be aware that they do not accept travellers cheques, altho the owner suggested I just pay the balance later in the week, once I'd cashed more cheques, so I wasn't leaving myself without any cash. The room itself was very clean, as was the bathroom. The location is ideal for Manns, the Walk of Fame, etc. We had mixed feelings about staying so close to Hollywood Blvd., as we had heard it can get pretty dodgy at night, but it wasn't so bad. The back entrance to the Liberty is right next to a very fancy hotel with doormen, so no chance of getting mugged on the (very short) walk home! The area might not be for everyone, it is very touristy, a bit run down and further down the boulevard is a bit dodgy, but it's certainly not as bad as some people say it is! It's weird to see such huge differences in people's opinions, not just of this place, but of any accommodation.
