Do, however, prepare yourself to be pleasantly surprised at the bang this little spot provides for your buck. Whispering Hills is located on a fairly quiet spot on Shepard of the Hills Parkway (no 76 traffic!), although several shows and attractions are nearby. The desk staff are friendly and engaging and you quickly learn that breakfast, with \"hot\" eggs, biscuits and gravy, and waffles, is served from daily from 6am - 10am. Dessert, with homemade cobbler, cookies, and soft serve ice cream is nightly from 9pm - 11pm and the coffee pot is always going. The basic rectangular pool is steps from the front door and the desk will provide pool towels as needed. The rooms are fairly standard - ours is 2 queens - with a small table with 2 chairs and a tube tv in an armoire. No closet, but there is a \"train rack\" for hanging. The room also provides a blow dryer, iron and ironing board, botanical soaps and shampoo, and various towels for four (a little on the skimpy side). The beds are quite comfortable with good pillows and higher-quality bed linens than most value spots provide. The AC works well and is fairly quiet. This is not a new place, but everything seems sparkling clean. Our only complaint was that the ice machine on our floor didn't work. Breakfast is almost on par with a Hampton (although it doesn't vary during our stay) and a step above most of its local competitors that serve only a limited continental breakfast. Some fresh fruit would be a welcome addition. At dessert, the 2 cobblers (blackberry and apple for our stay) and cookies are fresh and tasty - what a treat! And the price for all of this? We snagged a $63/night cancellable rate, while the Hampton was running just over $100/night advance purchase required for the same nights. The savings paid for several of our meals thoughout our stay.

We were going to spend a lot of money on a very nice dinner so we skimped a little bit on the hotel. We chose this hotel because it was inexpensive and advertised a free hot breakfast and dessert in the evening. Plus we knew where it was and it looked nice on the outside. When we got there after check in time, our room wasn't ready, which wasn't a huge deal because our dinner reservation wasn't for a while so we drove around and came back. The front desk gentleman named John was very nice. I asked him if he'd been to the restaurant we were going to and he hadn't, but he wanted to know how it was so I told him I'd update him later on that. We got the key, went to our room and it was very clean and pretty. It had a refridgerator which was nice. We went to dinner (see my review on the Candlestick Inn) and skipped dessert because we figured to take advantage of the free hotel dessert (I had read in other reviews that it was very good). But it wasn't. There were cookies, apple & cherry cobbler, and ice cream that wasn't creamy or good whatsoever so we were disappointed. We got coffee though and took that back to the room. ALL NIGHT LONG we could hear EVERYTHING that was going on in the hotel, especially the screaming kids throwing a fit and running around. I know the hotel can't help this, but it was terrible. The air conditioner in the room worked but it did not zap the moisture out of the air so we felt like we were camping because it was damp. The next morning for breakfast we were excited about the \"hot\" items we'd heard about. It was waffles and biscuits/gravy which is the usual fare everywhere else. The only thing extra was a container of scrambled eggs. Another disappointment. The hotel has a nice check out time of 1pm, but I doubt you'll stay that long. If you do, the room probably won't be ready for the next guest in time. The hotel was OK, but not suitable for anything special. I like the fact that they make an effort to do something extra for their guests and keep the price down at the same time, but I wouldn't go back.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it and we'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "Travelgenie4U", "ReviewID": "UR115135345", "Content": "It was just the ticket!!!

We wondered if it would be a problem and would have to wait to get in to our room. We were greeted by such wonderful, friendly staff and they were more than happy to get us right in to our room. (We were very grateful, since we were so tired from our long drive!) The room was super clean, and the bed was so comfortable. The room was a nice size. We had a king bed room, with table and chairs. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. Room service was exceptional! They always made sure our room was cleaned and we had everything we needed. The breakfast was fantastic! Sausage gravy and biscuits, eggs, eggs with chopped ham, 2 kinds of waffle mix, bagels, doughnuts, oatmeal, several juices, milk......just a wonderful variety of foods. I've stayed in a lot of hotels and have never seen such a nice continental breakfast that was included in our stay. It did get very busy in the mornings during breakfast, and can get crowded, but it's nothing you wouldn't find at any other hotel during their breakfast time. The evening cobblers and ice cream was a perfect ending to our day. Our room was on the 2nd floor. but there is a ramp that makes is easy to roll your luggage up to your room. We had only booked a couple of days in the beginning, but everything was so wonderful we decided to stay a couple days extra. It's in a great location, close to everything. They do have a nice size pool and it was also very clean. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! We have already been talking about coming back next year. If we do, we will definitely stay here.

Also, we requested no room service, so not sure about that (we don't like other people in our room with our belongings when we're not there). They are located close to attractions / restaurants, and they are off the strip so it's nice and quiet. Our room was more spacious than others we have stayed in before. There were 3 of us, and we had plenty of room to be comfortable. During our stay, we really didn't encounter anything major. There were a couple of minor things. The first night we were there, we had to ask for a plunger to get the toilet flush properly. However, the clerk was nice and understanding. She offered to have someone to go look at it, but my husband just asked for a plunger, and told her that he didn't mind to take care of it. We didn't have any more problems with it throughout our stay. We had gotten a fridge for our room, and it really didn't get that cold. The 2nd day we were there, it started to get a little colder than the 1st day we were there. 2 Negatives for me (me only-not for my family), I'm really short and as the shower head was really high and sprayed more into a circle than a full shower spray (like water wasn't coming out of the middle of shower head, which I believe this is how it's made), the water seemed to beat directly down into my ears, and not spray more evenly down on me. The feather-down pillows were very nice to lounge back on, however for sleeping they were very thick. I personally like a more flat-cotton pillow.

My only recommendation for travelers is try to park towards the front of the hotel where the parking lots was more level, as the back of the hotel is a steep hill and makes it very difficult to get in and out of your vehicles.

If you need anything at all they quickly and graciousley jump right on your request. They have the best attitudes there. They recognize we have a choice to stay some place else if they don't live up to their promises in their ads. It's so clean and fresh too. They shut down right after the Christmas season and re-open in March. During that time every year they completely comb through the property and fix everything and update decor. The only downside I see with the property is the parking isn't level, but that's hard to find anywhere in Brason...Hello your in the ozark mountains...it's supposed to be hilly hahahahaha. The pool is wonderfully kept as well. You won't regret your decision to stay here I promise.

Our double room was clean and comfortable. We also enjoyed the free breakfast in the morning and cobbler and ice cream at night. There were a few small issues with the service at the motel. On Saturday after many hours of outlet shopping my friend and I returned to our room at about 3:30 pm to rest for a bit before evening activities and our room had yet to be visited by housekeeping. When the housekeeper did show up (about 4:00) we just asked for some more cups because we didn't want to have to leave the room and we really didn't need new linens. Also, the breakfast room seems a bit small--even though we were there during an \"off-season\" time, it was always packed, particularly at breakfast. One morning we had to clear a table of other guests' trays and trash before we could eat, which was kind of gross. I believe that the employees of the motel do work very hard and they were very polite, but it seems that the motel may be a bit short-staffed.
