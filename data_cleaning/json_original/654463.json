For a mega expensive city like Venice, this hotel offers great value.

We parked our car and motorbikes (in a trailer) in a large parking lot in Fusina and we took a boat to arrive in Venise. First impression, everything is beautiful, romantic, with the sun entering the small streets and canals, a beauty. But to find its way in such a labyrinth is not something easy. Anyway we found our ways after 30 minutes of walk and we arrived at the hotel (better would have been to take the nearest regular boat on the grand canal, 6\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for one way, better value than 120\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for a gondola). The hotel is placed on a little place with a church, a bar terrace, a little bridge, very cute place as you can see on the pictures of other visitors. We are welcome by a very friendly and helpful person speaking fluently Italian, English and French, who show us our room (the pink room, direct access to the breakfast area). The room is very nice and stylish with a fancy whirlpool, a shower behind the bed, a big bed in the middle of the room, and a ceiling with gorgeous hand-painting decorations. The room is getting on the small place and is very quite (something you should know about Venise is that it is very peaceful and quite place after 10.00pm. So if you like nightlife and party, Venise is definitely not the place. We only found a teeny tiny bar, in a street 500m from the hotel in the direction of rialto bridge, which is offering delicious cocktails like Rhum/fresh strawberry/Basil until 2.00am. It's cold the Geneva. Otherwise you'll have to go to big hotels bars). In the breakfast room you have a small balcony offering a charming view on the canal and the bridge which is next to the hotel. But there is only 1 table which is fitting on that balcony so make sure you are the firsts or the lasts to come to breakfast to have it. ;) If we would have to recommend a hotel in Venise, we would definitely recommend this one. It is not too expensive (in regards with the competition, because sometimes it is really crazy). We would also recommend to stay no longer than 3/4 days in Venise except if you are in love with basilicas and churches and you want to visit the 140 churches that Venise can count. But it is worth it the visit, nowhere else in the world you can find a place which smells that romanticism, mystery and baroque charm.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIt could have been good, if only...\u201d", "Author": "Abramovi", "ReviewID": "UR122372715", "Content": "1) have wasted time and money to create bad taste decor, like golden painted wall with red lamp, old and new framed mirrors.

All facilities were great, wifi excellent, the jacuzzi fantastic, the bathroom huge. Very accessible, you take the waterbus number 1, to San Stae stop (the third stop) and then you go to the right of the museum up until you find the first turn left (big bridge to the left). You pass 4 bridges straight and you arrive at a square. Boom your hotel is on the right hand side.

After a long trip we arrived at the hotel in the afternoon only to be met by the manager, who advised that there was a black out in our room. Because the hotel was at full capacity he offered us another room at their B&B - Hotel Diamante until the power was restored in our room. We were extremely disapointed because the B&B was of a lower standard to the hotel we had booked and I had splurged on this hotel for my partner's birthday. 2 days later we had heard nothing from the manager so we went back to the hotel and spoke to a man at the reception. When we enquired about the room he told us there were guests in the room. So it became clear that the manager had lied to us and moved us because of a double booking. The man at the reception even admitted to this and told us that it had happening a lot lately.. When we returned to our B&B, the manager was there and when we asked what was happening with our room he told us that the power had still not been fixed. When we told him we were just at the hotel and there were guests staying in the room he became completely irrate and started yelling at us. We were told to leave the B&B and not pay anything and it wouldn't matter to him. It became impossible to discuss the matter with him due to his aggressive manner an he eventually stormed out. We ended up staying at the B&B which was nice and the lady there really looked after us. However our experience at Giulietta & Romeo was terrible and really did spoil our stay in Venice.
