He was uncooperative and did not care about the guests. The only nice and kind person was the luggage handler who had to carry all the suitcases in a tiny lift. We carried our own suitcases to our room as he was struggling with a full coach load of bags and suitcases. Wifi was charged at 5 Euro per hour and when we asked to get only 30 minutes, the manager answered that the hotel wasn't offering the option. We found this attitude very upsetting, especially in the heart of Europe and with the prices being charged for the rooms! Breakfast was of mediocre quality and one lady kept watching clients helping themselves to the food, just in case they were taking a piece of bread or a bun with them to eat later. She kept staring at clients and at the food on their tables obsessively. This attitude was extremely annoying as they did not seem to care about customers\u2019 satisfaction but more about the quantity of the poor quality food being eaten or taken away. Personally, I would recommend to avoid this hotel until the managment understands that guests should be treated nicely and changes its attitude.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney - Australia", "Title": "\u201cPleasent stay\u201d", "Author": "cluffne", "ReviewID": "UR117786992", "Content": "Rooms 101 and 303 were of acceptable size, not to large, but comfortable.

With a little guidance from the hotel staff, I found that the neighborhood restaurants (mostly hidden, all full of Italians and thus good food, and none with the obnoxious guy standing outside trying to pull you in as you too often find near all the tourist attractions) were quite nice. There are buses to get to the tourist areas, but you can also just walk in (less than 15 minutes to get into the Via Veneto area inside the roman walls). As a runner, I was also happy to find that there were two parks nearby (Villa Borghese and Villa Ada), so I even managed to get in a morning run.

She told us we were staying in their \u2018sister hotel\u2019 for the first night of our stay. Why? We were not told, she did not offer an explanation. When we asked she just brushed it off saying it was just for the first night of our stay and didn\u2019t elaborate any further. After 36 hours of flying, transit, and transportation, we didn\u2019t push the matter, we just wanted to get to whatever hotel room they had for us, freshen up and rest. She said it was \u2018just along the road up there\u2019 and pointed in the direction of. We asked if it would be hard to find or if she could show us on a map but she insisted no, that it was just that way and if we went that way we would find it. Fortunately it was just at the end of the road and around the corner, so it was easy to find\u2026 but when asking her we didn\u2019t know this and it may have been courteous to show us on a map just to humour us or to explain to us just how easy it really would be to find. So without explanation of why we had been put in a different hotel to that which we had booked\u2026 and with minimal directions as to where we were going, we lugged our bags up the road in hope the \u2018sister hotel\u2019 we had been shunted out to wasn\u2019t too far. To our satisfaction it was a five minute walk to the end of the street, turn left, cross the road and we were there. The following day our bags were transferred from the \u2018sister hotel\u2019 back to Hotel Buenos Aires where we collected them at reception and checked in to our room there. We took our own bags up the stairs \u2013 our preference to using tiny worn out little lifts \u2013 and into our room. Nice d\u00e9cor and bathroom, though this hotel room was very small. You could edge your way sideways around the bed, between the bed and the desk and into the bathroom. There was enough room for one person to stand in the bathroom at a time, and a little room behind the door to the room when it was closed, which we had to make use of for our bags. The bed was hard, but we still managed good night\u2019s sleep. The shower was very good and the overall cleanliness of the room was good too. When we went down for breakfast in the morning a brunette woman come through the breakfast room telling everyone in there to get out that breakfast wasn\u2019t starting until fifteen minutes later, there had been a mistake and obviously one of the staff had opened the breakfast room early or something had gone wrong somewhere along the line, she come through waving her arms and with minimal English saying people weren\u2019t welcome in there yet etc, but people had already filled their plates, sat down and began to eat. You would think by then the staff would just work around the problem without being rude to the guests like so, but obviously that was not her thinking. We had booked to return to this hotel again a couple of weeks later on a return to Rome during our stay in Italy. When we returned we encountered another room of the same standard as the first, equally as small but with pleasant d\u00e9cor and it was nice and clean. The second visit we dealt with two different male staff at reception who were much more pleasant to deal with than the two women we encountered on our first visit. In short Hotel Buenos Aires has small rooms with nice d\u00e9cor and a good standard of cleanliness. The standard of customer service is changeable by the staff member, sometimes quite cold and unhelpful, others quite pleasant. The hotel itself is about a 40 minute walk from The Spanish Steps, Trinita Dei Monti, Keats Shelley Memorial House Museum, Trevi Fountain, and about 20 minutes to Villa Borghese and Museo de Villa Borghese.
