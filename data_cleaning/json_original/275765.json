Free wifi worked no problem and there were 2 laptops if you had no ipad etc. Its on 3rd floor so no noise if windows closed. apparently aircon is extra. Staff are all very nice, no problems and always a smile. In room safe worked great, TV was a bit fiddly however. Plenty of space in the rooms and daily cleaning was spot on. Room had a fridge also but it could have done with a clean inside however I suspect cleaning staff aren't going to look into fridge every time. Termini is alright area, most people seem to stay there. It seems rough but i found it very safe walking around. Get a daily metro ticket for \u20ac4, covers metro and bus and tram.

Finding a quad room in Rome, for a semi-reasonable price, is a challenge! We wanted one for this one night close to Termini so when we arrived from Sorrento we could easily walk to it with our luggage (took us maybe 3 minutes). It would also be an easy walk back to Termini to catch the Fiumcino Express train, though we used RomeCabs for a private transfer since we needed to be picked up at 3:30 a.m. for a 6 a.m. flight. Hotel Orlanda exactly fit the bill!!!! Good price, large quad room, twin beds for the kids, super nice staff, clean and comfortable. The quad room we had looked EXACTLY like the photos on their website. The room was great. It is a corner room, so you have a window facing out 2 sides of the building, which makes the room bright AND gives you good airflow. It is on the 5th floor (Room 503) so you are quite a ways above the street noise. With the windows open in the day, this is admittedly a noisy area of town and you still get street noise. The windows are good, though, and with them closed the street noise was very, very minimal (not a problem at all). The room was large, and by Roman standards was VERY large (take a look at the photos on their website and you'll see the dimensions). The bathroom is also very large by European standards and would even be considered a good size in North America (I would say the size of a bathroom in a Holiday Inn Express in the USA). We walked in with our 4 pieces of luggage and had everything every which way (it was the last day of a long trip) and there was still PLENTY of room in the room. There is a blowdryer on the wall in the bathroom. The finishes in the bathroom were VERY nice, and the rest of the room was nice with tile floors and nice wallpaper. Hot water was plentiful (ah, such a joy after staying places where it wasn't) and the shower had excellent water pressure. Everything was absolutely spic and span clean! There was a large t.v. (not flat screen) with English language channels (the first we had encountered in 10 days, so my teenagers spent the first hour after check-in happily lounged on their beds watching something or another). My boys were EXTREMELY happy to have the 2 twin beds. There was also a futon type of chair in the room that looked to make out into a 3rd twin sized bed, though we didn't try it and I think it would be most appropriate for a younger child. All the beds were perfectly comfortable. The staff was great. When we straggled in after getting off the very hot train from Naples they gave us 2 bottles of iced tea for free and also pointed me to the coffee machine (free espressos, cappucinos, coffee, lattes....). There is a little cooler in the room behind the front desk where they sell pops/waters/drinks for a very reasonable price and you just pay at the front desk. When they heard we were leaving basically in the middle of the night, they brought up breakfast for us on a tray in the evening so it would be ready for us. Toast, muffins, jellies, butter, honey, yogurts, juices.....it was a very sweet gesture and one that I wasn't expecting at all. All the staff just gave off a good vibe. Nice folks. And we were there for less than 12 hours! There is wifi available for free (we were on the 5th floor and reception was iffy, but you can walk down to the 3rd floor lobby and make yourself comfortable). They also had 2 laptops set up in the room behind the front desk (where the coffee machine is, yippee!) and that made checking in for our flight the next door so much more manageable than trying to do it on my smartphone. The laptops were MUCH appreciated!!!! The laptops had Italian keyboards, and the staff was very sweet as I kept walking out to ask for help \"Can I borrow a pen?\" \"How do I make the @ sign on this keyboard?\" We had a wake-up call that was spot-on in time. The area....I was prepared for a dismal, crime-ridden area, but was delighted that the actual street it is on is actually quite cute with lots of sidewalk cafes (even in early April) and it was HOPPING with tourists from all the adjacent hotels until late at night. It felt very safe, which I wasn't expecting.

Generally the attractions are spaced far apart so access to the metros with a 4 euro day pass can shuttle you around quickly using the A and B lines (you can also use buses). The location is right in the tourist zone with a zillion other hotels, so ignore comments on the area being dirty or typical of train stations, it's not true - Rome was clean in our experience.

It was a very warm late June 2004 and for starters the Orlanda had excellent air-conditioning in the rooms! Quite a relief after a day on the town. Back to the beginning, You have to look to find the sign that directs you to the hotel. The usual cramped elevator lifts you to the unassuming entrance. In the small tidy lobby, A young, (as was all of the desk staff) very friendly, english fluent desk attendant checked us in, offering maps and orientation. The rooms (we stayed in two as we returned to the hotel at the end of our trip) would qualify as basic, but were very clean and actually good sized. The mattresses could use a slight upgrade, if one had to find something not quite right. It seems like all the money has gone into the bathrooms which had marble floors, plenty of towels, plenty of hot water, hair dryer and were quite large by European standards. Of course, the view out the window was of the adjoining building and was only picturesque in the laundry on the line with kids playing in Italy kinda way. But we're not in Rome to sit in our hotel! So perhaps the Orlanda's true value is its proximity to the Termini. The subway and any bus to anywhere in the city is only three minutes away, As are trains to anywhere in Europe. Close but not too close as you don't really hear the train activity. (of course, you do have the air-conditioning on. Did I mention it is remote controlled? Just like a tv remote). Once you get the hang of the Metro and buses much of Rome is easily at your command. Location, location, location. There are restaurants in the neighborhood of adequate quality and the streets a bit busy for sidewalk dining, although we did anyway, but remember you're only minutes from transportation to anywhere you want to go and the nice person at the desk will tell you how to get there. Also there is gelato right next door, which, it turns out, is important in summer. One other mention, the hotel breakfast was simple, but fine to start your day and the coffee in the automatic dispenser was actually the best I'd had in years! I'm serious.

The room had a queen-size bed and two twin beds with a cleanly washed, odorless, cozy bedding (They changed the bedding every morning). The beige-marble-floored room was very roomy, equipped with a personal air conditioner (cool or hot). We appreciated the blue color of curtains, two framed classic pictures, the small refrigerator, the safe box, and the clean, remodeled bathroom with a cute bidet and a plenty of hot water supply. The television was small (17 inches maybe), but it had many channels (no adult channel, which was good for parents with children). The all-you-can-eat breackfast with milk, bread, cereal, cheese, orange juice, and 20-some different kinds of coffee was free and of very decent quality. The serving ladies were kind. The breakfast room was also very clean and classic. The staff in the front didn't usually smile, but were very professional, informative, industrious, and responsive. They gave us very helpful tips and free maps for tours. According to our request by email, they arranged a taxi from the airport (we paid 47 Euros). We liked the Mercedes-Benz taxi. So, we used the taxi service again back to the airport. The location of Orlanda was close to major tour sites (20-minute pleasant walk to Colloceum, Capitol, Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and luxury shopping streets). For further places such as Vatican and the Mouth of Truth, we rode a bus or subway (one Euro per ride): the Termini is two blocks away. The location of Orlanda was very safe. Non-hotel residents had no way to come into the hotel without passing the staff's checking. Even in the midnight, the street was crowded with people (mostly, tourists in the neighboring hotels). The street was always lively. The only thing that bothered us a little bit was the noise of traffic, but as long as you want to stay inside Rome, you should bear with it. We strongly recommend you Hotel Orlanda.", "Date": "January 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cProblems with Orlanda Hotel\u201d", "Author": "natale", "ReviewID": "UR2842319", "Content": "My friend and myself stayed at the Hotel Orlanda in September 2004. My daughter made the booking with the hotel in May giving her credit card details (as my friend and myself do not have credit card's). When we arrived we saw the lift only accommodates 1 person and a suitcase (also the lift was very old) so we decided to walk up the 4 flights of stairs (luggage included) to the hotel. We was given a cold welcome and given the keys to our rooms. The rooms were clean and adequate (for our 1 night stay). Next morning we had to go up to another hotel which was in the same building for breakfast, the breakfast was very nice. When we checked out we were told by a member of staff we had to pay for our nights stay. We explained that the rooms and payment had been payed for in May by my daughter with her credit card. We were told the credit card details my daughter gave only 'secures' the rooms and no payment is taken out. We both had to pay the bill useing our spending money. Luckly when we arrived back home and no money had been taken out of my daughters account to pay for the hotel. I cannot understand as to why the hotel does not explain this when asking for credit card details. I dont think we will be staying at the Orlanda again.", "Date": "November 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery Satisfied with the Orlanda\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2765761", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the Orlanda for 5 nights during a trip around Europe last fall. For us, with our heavy backpacks, it's location just around the corner from the train station was perfect. However, it was quite a walk to any sites of interest. Our room was always spotless and, by European standards, very large. The room looked as though it had been recently renovated and the photos on the hotel website are very accurate. After a long day, the hike up the many flights of stairs to the hotel was exhausting. (There was an elevator, but one look at it convinced us never to get inside.) The breakfast was very disappointing, but at least you could eat as much as you wanted. Both the coffee and orange juice came out of a machine and one morning, I ate what I am sure was the world's worst tasting croissant.

It's hard to find the hotel ,there is no sign outside the building and hotel itslef is only a part of many other hotels inside the same building and it takes only few floors. 3.the corridor is bleak and the elevator looks as though it was taken from the belle epoque which could have been good had it not been slowly and small. yes the rooms are nice but it doesn't worth the prices they take.", "Date": "April 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodbury, CT, USA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient Location & Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1719651", "Content": "We stayed there March 9 & 10 2004.
