The grounds are stunning, the history is palpable, the pools stunning and the additional activity offerings and onsite restaurants, spa and shops are wonderful. The rooms, unfortunately can't hold a candle to the exterior beauty of the resort. Last year when we stayed here we were in a deluxe room and found it to be dated,dark and drab. This year we decided to upgrade to a villa suite as we thought it may be more upscale. While the room itself was spacious, with a living room, full kitchen, walk in closet and large bath, once again we found scratched furniture, stained cushions on the chairs and the carpeting was worn with ground in traffic patterns. Our only other criticism is the \"reserving\" of pool chairs. While signage states that one should not reserve chairs, this is clearly not the case. Almost every morning I saw people out as early as 7:00am taking towels and items from their rooms and reserving up to 8 chairs at a time. When I checked back later in the day it seemed these chairs had not been used until late afternoon! This is much too high class a resort for this type of activity to go on. There is no life guard so no staff monitor the pool activity. Also sorely missing were any wait staff taking orders for drinks, etc. This resort is a Hilton property, but honestly I have stayed at much less expensive Hiltons and had more updated rooms. We love the Biltmore, step up and renovate your rooms!

Long story short, at check out they charged me for all the spa treatments. Stood there for 45min while they tried to figure out what to do. Doris, manager, rudely came to tell me she would take the charges but if I did something wrong I WILL be charged. I tried to explain all I did, she shook her hand at me and said I already heard the story I don't need to hear it again. Dismissed by the manager of this resort. Shocking.

To add insult to injury, a girl who turned up the day after me and was not a HH member got comped a suite which was a complete contrast to my room, as did others who were at the conference with me. Good bar, good restaurants, good wifi. Make sure that you don't use the hotel \"taxi\" to go to the shopping/restaurant area just down the road though.

The bedding was very comfortable and we had a great balcony over looking the pool. The pool adjacent to the Valley Wing is quiet and while we were there, mainly used by adults. There is a larger pool not far from the Valley Wing that is much larger, and even has a slide. It seemed like most of the kids were hanging out in that area. The conference I attended was about 1200 people and I thought the meeting space was accommodated the size of group and activities planned very well. The continental breakfasts and lunches were also of good quality. My coworkers and I ate at one of the hotel restaurants, Frank & Alberts, for dinner as well as for breakfast. The food is excellent, however the staff were a little on edge. They were nice, but a little thrown off by special requests. The patio is beautiful. My only complaint is that there are a lot of birds that were sharing the patio with us at breakfast. As soon as other diners got up to leave, the birds would flock to the table for scraps.

I think they focus too much on style instead of functionality. There is no question the architecture and the grounds / landscaping are beautiful; it's the rooms that don't match up. The rooms have mission style furniture; but it is cheap and looks cheap. The desk and night stand had the veneer warped and buckling from I can only guess was water damage - just like mom always said, use a coaster for your drink or this will happen. One of the two bathroom sinks were backed up, as was the shower - these were corrected when we called to have the problem fixed. The shower stall had a soap dish on one wall and that was it, might sound petty, but I think the modern person / family uses more than a bar soap to bathe themselves. Any bottles of shampoos, conditioners, or anything else had to be place on the floor - end of the world? No, just annoying. The towel rack was on the opposite side of the shower, there was no place to put your towel near the shower - again, end of the world? No, just annoying to walk across the bathroom dripping wet to get a towel. Lamp shade had a decorative edging that was falling off and hanging down. The AC unit was excellent, actually got cold when it was turned down! Also, you will be able to hear your neighbor coming and going from their room - walls are thin, and the automatic door closure slams the doors. I was surprised when we ordered room service that it didn't come on a table, just a tray and you had to figure out where to place it to eat comfortably. If you don't valet park, and choose to self park - be prepared for a good walk to your room. There is one small parking lot, and a parking garage both are a good distance from the rooms - we had a 7 minute walk to our room. This was really annoying since we were doing different stuff in the city, we were constantly driving back to the hotel to change and then head back out again. They had a large parking lot right in front of the main entrance that was for valet parking only - so you have to pay someone to park your car 30ft. The employees all seem very well trained, nice, attentive. The putting greens were a nice touch, and very fun.

We have recently stayed at some of the finest resorts in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area: Four Seasons, Royal Palms, Westin Kierland Villas, and Princess. We were expecting the service at the Arizona Biltmore to be on the same level as these resorts. It most definitely was not. Upon arrival, we valet parked our car. More on that later :( At check in, I inquired about upgrading our room. The woman at the front desk was completely clueless. My husband and I got the impression that she had never worked a front desk before and this was her first day working in the hotel industry. This is a WALDORF property! After about 15 minutes of her not understanding what I was asking for and my husband ready to completely lose his cool, I finally requested she find a manager. He was accommodating and found us an Ocatilla room, which we paid more money for. I don't understand how the resort's first foot forward could be someone so poorly trained and clueless. I talked my husband off the cliff and we headed to the room ready to put the past 30 minutes out of our mind and enjoy our vacation. Not so fast. We had asked the valet to get all of the bags out of the trunk and requested they be brought to the room. When they arrived, one of our bags was missing! Our bags had been sitting on a luggage cart the entire time we were hassling with the front desk and we were sent into panic mode as to where the bag could be. Murphy's law, it was the one bag that we absolutely could not lose. Eventually they found the bag (claimed it had never been taken out of the trunk) but WOW what a TERRIBLE start to this vacation! The rest of the stay was just okay. We got massages and facials in the spa and my husband said it was the worst massage he's ever had. Mine was pretty good.

Well, the temperatures outside were already plenty warm (we are from Denver), so we were hoping that the older building system had the ability to cool things off. Not so much. Unfortunately our room faced south and since cleaning was done after noontime, we were gone until the early evening and unable to close the heavier blinds to block the afternoon sun and its heat.

There is one slide which isn't huge, but big & fast enough for adults to enjoy it too. There were plenty of wait staff to make getting food & drinks easy & quick all day. There are 3 pools in this complex, then there are 5 other simple rectangular pools scattered throughout the villas. I was sorry to have missed an aqua aerobics class. If you go, be sure to check the Recreation Center (a little hard to find - adjacent to the salon) for a schedule at the beginning of your visit. There's also yoga & other classes, plus bike rental, tennis, basketball, etc. The grounds at this hotel are stunning, and I really enjoyed walking around taking pictures of the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. You really feel like you're experiencing history in this hotel originally built in 1929 which has hosted every President since. Currently there is a great b/w photo gallery on FLW & his photographer Pedro Guerrero in a hallway off the lobby. I thought our room was great - very comfortable bed, bathroom was elegant ... and we were just in the standard room with a view of the main pool complex. There is a mini bar fridge, which we used to store our water bottles, fruit, etc. when we arrived. One of the most convenient aspects of this hotel was the straight shot down 24th street to the airport - couldn't have been easier. And they use a great car service, Execucar (part of the Super Shuttle company), if you don't have a rental. Also, the free Wi-Fi was nice. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Historical Property, but...\u201d", "Author": "SFtravelsoftern", "ReviewID": "UR126647137", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Biltmore. As much as I really wanted to love it, my overall feeling as I left this morning was that the place is overrated and overdeveloped. There are some beautiful areas at the Biltmore. Most notably are the original hotel building, cottages, and surrounding grounds which date back to the late 20's/early 30's. The Frank Lloyd Wright architecture is timeless and stunning. I especially enjoyed the 90 minute walking tour offered by the hotel where you can learn about its history. Unfortunately, thats where my love affair with the Biltmore ends. We were upgraded to a Golf Course Villa upon arrival. My initial excitement was replaced with disappointment when I opened the door. The 1 bedroom Villa was spacious. However, the decor was at least 20 years old. Formica counters, vinyl tub and shower enclosure, stale smell, dirty carpet, 27 inch tube tv's...not what I expected for a room that goes for $700 per night on their website. Didn't expect the ants either, but I guess that is common in Arizona. Also, the Golf Course Villas are on the far end of the property and I felt completely removed from the resort. There are a signficant number of these Villas on the property, and it gives the property the feel of a subdivision rather than a luxury resort. They are built to \"resemble\" the original architecture, but they don't. Its really quite a shame. Resort fee was $28 plus tax per day, self parking is $12 more, or you can Valet for another $28. I know this is the norm in AZ, but when paying upwards of $500 per night, I find it insulting to pile on the fees. Overall, the service was good and the staff were friendly. The gym was also nice. I just can't get over how old and shabby the Villa was.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe best\u201d", "Author": "j d", "ReviewID": "UR126611572", "Content": "no need to say anything else.

The front desk staff were not very friendly - but still accomodating. They should be more energetic and gregarious but that is so small in the scheme of things. We had the best package with daily meal vouchers and spa discounts. It was perfect. The thing about this resort is that it is old and historical. If you are looking for chic, posh and a spot for the fabulously nipped, tucked and star struck - you need to go elsewhere. The Biltmore is comfortable and kitchey - and that makes it a great place to go. I never felt under dressed or out classed like in many top resorts.

Lots of chairs and outdoor fireplaces which were great spots for reading and relaxing outside. I used the resort's fitness center and it was very nice. Lots of space with two separate rooms: one for lots of machines and the other with nautilus machines and room for one to do free weights, floor work,etc. I ate at Frank & Albert's restaurant in the resort. Once for dinner and once for breakfast and both were quite good. The dinner was especially good. The conference was in the resort so we also got to experience their conference facilities which were good. Standard amenities and the food was average for a conference. In terms of the rooms, the room was large and spacious with a nice little balcony. The decor is not my taste but I guess it was in keeping with the overall resort's look, although the common areas seemed to be a lot nicer than the room. The bathroom was very large but the resort's age was apparent in the water system. The water pressure in both the shower and toilets was quite low -- like it was running on an older plumbing system. Had they upgraded the bathrooms to more modern fixtures and functionality I think they could have kept the \"old world\" charm while still offering a more contemporary experience. I stayed in the Paradise wing of rooms and the elevators in that wing were awful. Again, another example of the resort's age. This wing had 4 floors and the elevator routinely stopped on every floor even if you did not press that floor and each time when the door opened to that floor, no one was there so it appears the elevator just stopped on that floor without being called. I was on the 4th floor, of course, so I had to suffer through stopping at every floor on nearly every elevator ride which was annoying by day 2.

We regularly travel with my husband, my mother, my baby and myself so we are always looking for great 2 bedroom suites to have separate bedrooms and a common area. I also look for fabulous grounds for my family to play on and have the run of the place. The Biltmore far exceeded our needs and expectations. We had a rocky start when we checked in. I spend a great amount of time researching where we stay, reading reviews, getting the best deal and confirming my reservations. In this case I had another criteria which was to be able to check-in as early as possible and check-out as late as possible because we flew in on a 6 a.m. flight and would fly out on a 6 p.m. flight. I ended up booking through AMEX Platinum Concierge. I booked a 2 bedroom villa suite. It was a few dollars more than booking it through the hotel but it allowed for the late check out and came with 2 breakfasts per day and a resort credit. The requested an early check in but all the Villas were occupied so they were unable to honor the request. My only regret was that when we called the hotel after landing at the airport they did not inform us that we could rent a cabana by the pool that had its own kitchen and bathroom. It would have been a nice way to relax after getting up at 3 a.m. with a baby. We learned this the next day. We were told to go to the hotel to pre-register to get the earliest possible room which we did. When my husband checked in they told him it was just a one bedroom villa suite. I went inside myself to find out what was going on. They told me the same thing. I assured them that I had booked a two bedroom and that it was one of the main reasons we were staying there. They said they did not have any available. I then told them that I had booked one and what the price was per night on my confirmation. This immediately got their attention because the price on my reservation was for a 2 bedroom. They spent at least 20 minutes making a way. They told me that they would take care of it and gave us a time frame the room might be ready by. I appreciated the effort they made to make it right. I was actually thinking if it didn't work out it would be ok and I would go stay at the Holiday Inn and save a bunch of money. Fortunately, that did not happen because the resort was fabulous. The grounds were gorgeous but not arrogant. There were all types, classes, races and ages of people. They never frowned on kids running on their perfectly manicured green lawn. They actually had life size chess and checkers game on the lawn. The cafe served great Starbucks coffee and drinks. It closed a little too early on the weekend. The gym was great. The pools were fun. Unfortunately, unlike most 5 star hotels the service by the pool was lacking. There was one server trying to cover the whole pool and the area became covered in nasty wet towels quickly. The tennis courts were great. We were able to rent equipment and have a great time. We stayed in a Villa that was furthest away from the main resort but it was great. Also, each set of condos has their own pool. This meant we had a heated pool right outside our back door. Fortunately their was a gated area between the door and the pool because we have a one year old. The grounds are huge so be sure to bring your stroller. We actually bought one and don't know what we would have done without it. We ate the hotel restaurant, Frank and Alberts for breakfast everyday and had dinner there one night. They have a great breakfast menu and a great buffet. We enjoyed both. We sat outside for every meal. They have fire places and heaters and it was a great time. There is a wonderful business center with color printers. Unfortunately, they never refilled our mini bar beverages and snacks for some reason. We also had a hot water problem. During the first shower, after a simple shampoo, the water would turn cold. The happened on the king suite side and on the adjoining double bedroom side. Very strange. It was very nice but the kitchen and shower weren't as modern with appliances and tile and such as most upscale hotels we stay in but it was very nice and very clean. It was also great for putting a baby to bed and being able to stay up without disturbing his sleep. The curtains and drapes were great for room darkening although there was an art to closing them just right. The hotel grounds staff was also noisy as they roll their carts and towel bins up and down the street outside of the hotel and they would just congregate in the street outside our room and talk. The best I could tell a great number of them came to work at 5:30-6 every morning because that is when the baby would wake up abruptly and then we would hear them outside. I would absolutely stay here with my family again. I would be interested in reserving one of the cottages on the other side of the property. There is great shopping and dining a very short distance from the property but not really walking distance.

The Ocatilla rooms are in their own building and have their own exclusive lounge with concierge. That lounge was such a great benefit. Cold water, Tea, lemonade, and soda are available all day. Every morning there is a nice continental breakfast available, with good pastries, tons of appealing fresh fruit, bagels, yogurt, and excellent granola. Each evening there are appetizers and wine & beer before dinner, and dessert every night. All complimentary. There is ample seating and a lovely patio area including a fire which is great for s'mores (they have a kit for kids). The lounge features a wonderful concierge staff who are truly engaged and helpful, and very kind to families. We really appreciated Leo, but her fellow staffers were equally great. Unfortunately our interactions with other staff were more hit-and-miss. One concierge at the main building told us the wrong opening time for the putting range; at Frank & Albert's (one of the restaurants) we inquired around a vegetarian substitution for the burger and our server replied \"You mean like a turkey burger?\" That said, on a subsequent visit I heard a different server offer another guest a helpful list dishes on the menu that could be adjusted to become vegetarian, so our server may have just been an exception. We certainly liked our two meals at Frank & Albert's. Thanks to the Ocatilla lounge we didn't end up dining in any of the other restaurants or lounges. Be aware that the resort is large; it has numerous pools, tennis courts, conference facilities, and other amenities; it is surrounded by a gold course and other related residential properties so you are a long way from anything. It makes the atmosphere idyllic, but a quick jaunt out to get something isn't really possible. We ventured out for one great tour of Taliesin but otherwise we stayed on the property relaxing and enjoying the stunning grounds. If we were doing a lot of coming-and-going this might not have been such a great fit. It's really nice to wander the grounds and see the architecture (borrowing heavily from FLW, although he merely consulted on the project), the period furniture, and the historic photos everywhere. The grounds are well-kept and a treat for the eyes.

But excellent coffee. - Apps / light dinner: quite amazing food, really. Included things like mini quiches, wings, fresh veggies, mini cheeseburgers (yum) and plenty of nuts/snakcs - Desserts: fair assortment of rich but bite size goodies - Free wine/beer: this is bar far the best part. If you drink in the bars at the Biltmore, prepare to spend $12 - $15 / drink! They are amazing, but really? SO to grab a couple glasses of wine each night here really made more sense. The room we got was an ADA one (which I always seem to get). It was quite possibly the largest room (square foot size) i have ever been in. The walk-in closet could sleep 2 people alone! But they were missing a couple things: no floor length mirror anywhere; the bathroom light switch was outside the bathroom itself; very poor lighting in a large room. Good things included a nice shared patio that looks out onto the pool. A note about the pool: the bar here was never staffed.

They are relatively spacious, but the bathrooms are really outdated and beat up and the furniture is in need of an update, particularly for the price charged. I stayed on the top floor of the Valley building. I would recommend staying on the top floor of a building and close to the main pool. Apparently, the lower levels have a lot of noise and you can hear the people above you. I also had a huge balcony which was nice. I think it is cool how each guest is assigned to a different building...it reminded me of a college campus in a good way. The main pool area is great, and I recommend getting a cabana. The food at the pool is by far the best food I experienced in the hotel (which isn't saying much). The spa is pretty good (likely not updated since the 90's), and I had an amazing massage there. If the hotel updated the rooms, spa, offered better food, and overall made it a bit more luxurious, I would definitely stay here again.

I am going to tell you what the hotel did NOT tell me, that they should have: An enormous group books almost the entire property for a \"Passover VIP\" event (apparently many many years running). The issue for any innocent individual family is the following: 100% of the cabanas are booked by this group. So, during your entire stya, even if you wanted to spring the $200 plus (we did) for a cabana, it is not an option; the stunning main grounds on the interior of the property are set up for this group. So, if you want to have a drink, you won't be overlooking the gardens and walkways, you will be overlooking a group that is probably close to 800 people. The group I had no issue with: families enjoying their time as a group. But the \"full and fair\" use of the Biltmore I have a huge issue with. We didn't get to use many many of the amenities because of such a large group. A small (honestly maybe 10-15 families) group of us just sat shell-shocked by the pool because the resort was clearly scrambling to deal with their biggest paying customer of the weekend. Fair enough. But when we made the reservation, I can't imagine why they wouldn't have said \"Full disclosure...we have an enormous group here Easter weekend every year. No cabanas will be available during your stay, and most of the chairs by the main pool will be reserved (in advance) by this group. The tiny upside: this group ate all of their meals in the various banquet facilites, so all the restaurants (except for by the pool) were very serene.

The linens were lovely and the bed was comfortable, although a bit too soft for my liking. There was a clock radio that was also an iPod docking station which was nice. The room had a typical mini bar with overpriced items, but that was to be expected. Instead of a coffee maker there was a hot pot and French press. The food and service were good. Drinks were overpriced we thought. There were many places where groups could sit and chat, inside and out. A few areas had large gas fire pits which were nice during the cool evenings. This facility felt more like a business conference center than a resort hotel. There were two or three conferences going on most of the guests seemed to be involved in one of those. The pools were fairly deserted, I never saw anyone playing tennis and there were very few children. I rented a bike for an hour one day and rode along the canal.

Lowlights: lack of attention to detail, has some of the feel of a chain hotel, overall experience definitely not stellar. This is a fairly detailed review of our recent stay (12/26-30) at the Biltmore. My wife and I have stayed at several high-end hotels belonging to various \"groups\", and the Biltmore unfortunately rates lower than most in this category. We're not picky or pretentious, but we do value attentive, outgoing service and quality, so this review should be considered from that perspective. 1) Ocatilla Room We stayed in the Ocatilla wing of the hotel, on the first floor. What was good: - Spacious room. - Very comfortable king-size bed. - Nice decor. - Deep soaking tub with faucets placed to the side, which allows two people to soak together. The supply of a candle was a nice touch. What wasn't so good: - The bathroom should be called \"The Door Puzzle\". The main door, shower door and toilet closet door all open onto each other. It's actually possible to inadvertently \"lock\" someone in the toilet closet by leaving the bathroom door open at some angles. - The bathroom does not have a lit make-up mirror; this is almost inexcusable for a high-end hotel. - The room door does not close flush against the door frame such that whenever any of the other rooms' doors open or close, it rattles back and forth against the frame and this can wake you up. - The safe is *very* tiny. 2) Ocatilla Lounge - The lounge is too small for such a large wing with so many rooms / guests. The food display area is too small and is easily overcrowded. The serving dishes are also too small and this requires the waitstaff to constantly go back and forth to the kitchen to refill them. - The lounge serves continental breakfast until 9:30 on weekdays and 10 on weekends / holidays. Does anyone *really* get up that early when on holiday - or any day when on vacation? This isn't a business hotel after all, and it's a stretch to call it a resort with hours like that. 3) Pools - The pool water is too cold. Maybe the temperature is OK for mid-summer, but certainly not December. We tried going into both the Ocatilla and main pools, and they were simply too cold. We saw several people go in and come out rapidly. C'mon, this is a Waldorf-Astoria property, and the water is colder than at some economy hotels! - There was a good quantity of chairs and towels. 4) Restaurants - Frank and Albert's had both good service and food. The food was fresh and really delicious. Several dishes were remarkably good. - Wright's, the premier restaurant, had very good food, but the service was rather disorganized. Our amuse-bouche were not delivered before the main dishes, and the waitstaff did not seem to understand their respective roles (e.g., we were asked by both the waiter and the busboy if we wanted coffee). 5) Gym - There was plenty of exercise equipment and all of it was in good condition. - Towels and water are supplied. 6) Grounds - The grounds are well maintained and all trees/bushes/plants are nicely arranged. 7) Staff This is maybe the most important aspect of a hotel/resort experience so this is where we are the most critical or appreciative. - We found the administrative / clerical staff to be somewhat aloof and unwelcoming. None were warm or engaging. - The valet, bellhop and restaurant staff were good. All were helpful and attentive. - A few of them stand out: - When we arrived late to the Ocatilla lounge on our first morning, the desk staff simply told us that breakfast was over. Diego, one of the waitstaff overheard the conversation: he approached us afterwards and thoughtfully offered to go to the kitchen and collect some remaining pastries and fruits for us. - We decided to take a walk to a restaurant a couple of miles away, and one of the bellhops at the front entrance described a shortcut to us, and when we started to walk away Spencer asked if we would like some water bottles to take along, which we gratefully accepted. It was a small gesture, but the thoughtfulness one expects from good staff. My wife wondered if this was because the latter staff understand the relationship between their attitude and tips ;-) Lastly, while we understand that housekeeping staff are not generally the best paid, only one of the five we encountered could speak any English. This made for at least one challenging situation when we were trying to explain to one of the housekeepers that she should come back to the room in 20 minutes. Please note that this is not a racially or nationality motivated comment - rather, it's simply an observation that Hilton should ensure at least basic English speaking skills for all of its staff (or provide training). 8) In Summary - Room: 4/5 - Food: 5/5 - Facilities/Grounds: 4/5 - Service: 4/5 9) Final Verdict We've stayed twice before at The Phoenician and this was our first stay at the Biltmore. Our verdict is that The Phoenician it's definitely a notch above the Biltmore.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful Biltmore\u201d", "Author": "Ghibellina37", "ReviewID": "UR122380325", "Content": "My boyfriend and I spent the week after Christmas at the Biltmore hoping for a little R&R after a hellish month at work. We were a little concerned about the hotel as well as Phoenix; we heard the latter could be a bit over run with retirement-age folks and there might not be much for a couple of 20-somethings to do. Thankfully, our whole experience was great, from the hotel to city. Our daily agenda began with coffee/tea from the on-site Cafe (which was grossly over-priced but we were paying for the convenience of not having to leave the grounds). However, we quickly forgot the outlandish cost while basking in the warmth of the mid-morning sun in comfortable Adirondack chairs that encircle the main hexagon-shaped lawn. It was quite pleasant to watch other guests meander around the gardens, chatting and enjoying themselves. Children played catch in the lawn while some couples played a quick game on the adjacent putting course; all around very idyllic. As we had rented a car (for which the Biltmore had plentiful free parking), we would then venture out of the hotel for a day of hiking. During our vacation we hit Piestwa peak (very crowded but a good workout), the South mountain range and Tonto National Forest (highly recommend). We would stop for a quick lunch on our way home (go to TrueFood in the mall near the resort - amazing!) and then hit the pool for some relaxing. No complaints about the pool, very nice and resort-like. After a long day we would usually venture to the Spa. I really feel this was an added bonus to an already very nice trip. Certainly not the most luxurious amenities (not even top 10 to be honest) but it served its purpose and I always left relaxed. While we ate most of our meals off-site but did eat lunch at Frank & Albert's. Food was overpriced (as was everything) but at least it was good and the decor nice. Our room was big with a nice deck overlooking the Ocatilla pool (we were in the Valley Wing). The bathroom was big and the chairs comfortable. The bed was wondrous! As someone who sleeps with a Tempur-pedic pillow and mattress at home I usually wake up stiff in hotels but at the Biltmore I always woke up refreshed! Down padding and pillows with crisp, white sheets. I do understand how people might feel the rooms need an update; the wallpaper and ceilings looked a bit old, however nothing to loose sleep over (and how could you in such a great bed?) The grounds were perhaps our favorite part; lush, green lawns, ample, comfortable seating to enjoy the outdoors, unique orange, grapefruit and lemon trees with ripe fruit and chess and croquet. The service was also marvelous! Every staff member had a smile and a kind word. Our only complaint: the food at the pool side cafe, The Cabana, was atrocious. Edible, yes. But awful. I ordered a Chipotle Chicken Sandwich and received an odd, chewy, processed chicken patty with mustard and avocado. To top it off this embarrassment of a sandwich was $15 dollars! In order to make myself feel better I ordered a Strawberry daiquiri, which was also terrible! Obscenely syrupy-sweet and an odd consistency. Now that I think about it, we ordered a pizza from the late night Room Service and it was very sub-par.

Our sons, 6 and 13 were tired and crabby. At 2am, room service was the only option. As vegans, room service can be quite a challenge but not at this hotel. Our boys are not vegan and they had a marvelous thin crust cheese pizza- the crust was delightfully crispy and my boys were happy with a sufficiently gooey cheese that was not tired and dried out as room service can be. For my husband and I, we revised the chicken burrito into an incredible black bean burrito with fresh salsa, guacamole, and a spicy black bean sauce. All of us enjoyed mixed green salad with tomatoes dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. The sourdough bread rolls were warm and crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. For dessert, we had a marvelous fresh platter of assorted fruits- pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe, blueberries and blackberries. Prices for these fresh and healthy alternatives were very reasonable. the service did not stop there. The next evening for dinner, my son and husband had developed a cold with fever and chills and simply did not wish to leave the room. Thinking to surprise them with something enticing when they woke up, I searched the casual restaurant menu of Frank and Albert's for some vegan faire but was disappointed that there were very few alternatives. When trying to fashion existing faire into a corresponding vegan meal with the hostess, she volunteered that it would be better for me to speak with Chef Jason since he would simply make whatever we wanted..and make he did. First he queried our likes and dislikes pretty extensively and then asked if there were any special things we wanted to eat. He prepared a hearty black bean soup garnished with pickled carrots, onions and mild peppers, stuffed red peppers served with a delicious roasted red pepper coulis and a carpaccio of portabello mushrooms served with with a julienne of mixed vegetables, a mixed salad with fresh seasoned artichoke, two types of olives, and heirloom tomato dressed with a white balsamic vinaigrette. He meticulously packed it up to go including extra roasted red pepper sauce, extra stuffing, extra pickled garnish, and the vinaigrette and placed the soup in a thermos to keep it warm. He did not stop there. When I told him my 6 year old wanted bacon and broccoli, he prepared one of his favorite dishes- thinly cut french fries tossed with pancetta and two other types of diced bacon held together by melted cheddar cheese. And in case my son did not like it, he added a few strips of bacon on the side for him. Much to my son's delight, the broccoli was fresh and perfectly cooked- not mushy or crunchy and he loved the french fries concoction! Chef Jason gave me his card and told me that he would be pleased to meet our food needs at any time. He also introduced me to another chef who could also be contacted in the event that he was not available. It really was an amazing and kind service that is quite lacking in this automated world. The amount of care that was offered was quite unlike what we have experienced before- my husband and I are million mile travelers and we have seen our share of cursory service, but not here.

It was horrible and my back was sore and I decided that today my boyfriend and I should splurge and get a really nice room. The Arizona Biltmore looks really nice in the pictures on their website, but it was about the worst disaster I've ever had in any hotel. My boyfriend and I get into our room. It was a nonsmoking room with a balcony that you were allowed to go out and smoke on. We were super tired from driving and went outside to smoke cigarettes and sit down. This psycho lady two floors up from us screams down - and i kid you not- ARE YOU SMOKING? um, yes. we're allowed to. NO YOU'RE NOT. STOP. NOW. um.... no? So I went inside to call the front desk because I was afraid that maybe we misunderstood and it was a fully nonsmoking hotel. They said it was fine to smoke on the balconies. (I found out later that they actually sell cigars in the front lobby - it was a pretty smoker-friendly hotel). So we go back outside to try and finish out cigarettes, and this absolute lunatic of a woman starts screaming at us again: ARE YOU SMOKING AGAIN. yes, we called the front desk and they said we're allowed to. WELL I JUST CALLED THE FRONT DESK TOO AND THEY SAID YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO. um, i'm not sure what to tell you. we called and you're allowed to. NO YOU'RE NOT. I HAVE A BABY UP HERE. STOP SMOKING RIGHT NOW. can we please not have a screaming match in this nice hotel? STOP SMOKING! (mind you, i would never smoke next to a baby. but her room was two floors up from us with a sliding door to close off, and there were several other people on their balconies that were also smoking. they were also kind of staring at us). So i called security, and he had to verify with the MOD about the smoking policy, and i'm getting pretty frazzed because we seriously walked in and had this psycho lady start screaming at us, and I think the room cost about $300, and I really just wanted to sit down and relax. Security went and talked to the crazy people, but then we were basically asked if we wanted to just move rooms. While this is going on, the lady upstairs dumps water over her balcony onto our table outside, with my boyfriend's wallet, cigarettes and lighter. We move rooms, and then head to the bar to get a drink. I sit down and start reading some of the material that they gave me when I checked in, and see, to my absolute horror, that we've gotten this letter saying that the water is going to be turned off from 10 pm to 5 am for the two days that we were staying here. Like, if you want to brush your teeth you need to use the $8 Fiji water in the mini bar. ARE YOU KIDDING? No one said anything about there not being water in the room while we were booking the room or checking in, it was in this super secret envelope that they slipped to you with a bunch of other stuff when we checked in. Back to the front desk to try and move to a room that maybe has water so i can have the luxurious amenity of a SHOWER. they moved our room and gave us a discount, but the verdict on the room that we're in now: IT TOTALLY BLOWS. It's a \"suite\" which is a code word for a gigantic room with very little furniture in it. There's a bed and a couch and chairs, and this HUGE empty space in the middle of the room. The bathtub sucks and the water doesn't get hot enough. The room seems really dated and old, just with new sheets and towels, but the wallpaper is kind of peeling and the fixtures for everything are all really old looking. so my verdict on the whole hotel: the grounds are very beautiful. everything else is lame. stay somewhere else. And to the crazy lady upstairs: DUDE. CALM DOWN. You need to seriously take a valium or something.

The Ugly: I got food poisoning while staying at this hotel, and I am not the only person who got ill at this conference. Wi-Fi service was new and did not work properly. No free Wi-Fi in the conference rooms, when I asked for the password I was told there is a $350.00 charge. I had such high hopes for this hotel. I stayed at the hotel as part of a large conference, and it quickly became clear that the hotel was not equipped to handle a conference this large. We got to our room and discovered that the wireless was not working, when I called the front desk they acted like they did not know what I was talking about and claimed that they had not received any complaints. The next morning as I started talking to other conference attendees it became clear that there was a problem throughout the property as at least half of the conference participants had experienced issues. I then went to the front desk, it turns out that they had just upgraded to wireless service and they were having implementation issues, however, they agreed to move us to a villa, at no extra charge(where they said the wi-fi would be working). I was pleased with this as there was a huge discrepancy in the rooms, many people were complaining that the furnishings were worn and that outlets didn\u2019t work or pictures were falling off the walls (I personally know 2 people that had the same issues). The villa they moved us to, although very large and well kept, had not been updated since the 80\u2019s (both the bathroom and kitchen while clean and well kept desperately needed updates). If I had paid full price for the villa, I would have been annoyed. I was annoyed when 12 hours after moving into the villa the WiFi stopped working. The conference center was poorly laid out and difficult to both get to and navigate. The food was marginal, and as I mentioned about I came down with a case of food poisoning halfway through my stay and since I had only eaten on the property for 48 hours preceding my illness, I am positive it was related to the hotel. The staff is the one bright spot in my stay and while they did everything they could to be accommodating, it is clear that the hotel is simply was not set up to handle a conference of our size.

We were hassled going to the main pool while waiting for the room, forced to prove we were hotel guests because there was a draft party going on at the time. My young children were hassled by drunken guests at the pool while we were trying to enter (during daylight hours in 115 degree heat). Once we checked in, our building lost water for hours and the hotel couldn't give us an explanation of what happened or the expected duration. During my husband's most recent stay, the hotel moved him to the Ocatilla building but wouldn't allow him access to the lounge.

It is a lovely resort with lots of amenities for both the conference attendee and their spouse. Designed in the Frank Lloyd Wright style, the additions made over the years have been done in keeping with the original architecture. When we checked in we were shown to a room in the main building. It had an awful view over a roof. Our bellman called down to the desk and was told to come down to the desk with us and we would get another room. This seems to be the game \u2013 try to assign a substandard room. If you complain, then you are changed. We have had this happen to us many times and now know the drill. Go to the first room, call down and say it is unacceptable. You are them changed to a better room. I find this very annoying and a bad business practice. If the nicer room was available, why were we not placed there first? We spoke with others from our conference who had the same experience \u2013 one had to go to 3 rooms before they finally had a decent room. I would think the hotels would try to satisfy their customers initially, but this is often not the case. I also run a business and would have no clients if I treated them this way. The second room was in another building. It seemed satisfactory. It has sliding doors to a patio. However, after being in the room overnight, we discovered that the lighting was so poor that it was hard to read a book in the daytime! There was no center ceiling light and 3 lamps, although they all had the new energy saving bulbs which translates into dim light. We were too tired to pack up and ask for another room. The lighting is now something I will look at more carefully before accepting a room. The shower in the tub did not drain properly, so there was a lot of standing water after a shower.

We got complimentary internet access in the room and that was great too, as we used it a lot. But other than that, the room is very plain and ordinary.

What a shame what Astoria has done to the Biltmore. A beautiful property with lovely architecture, but the worst rooms, service and dirty on top of it! Not to knock another hotel, but this was barely one step above a motel 6! I was a bit skeptical after reading the many negative online reviews but really wanted to see the property and stay in what I thought was a piece of Arizona history. The hotel is in a lovely area of Phoenix and the grounds are magnificent. Because of reading many less than positive reviews I wanted to check out a few rooms before I chose one. I had booked through American Express Fine Hotel program so expected something special. Wow, what a disappointment! Steve at the front desk was very nice, efficient and professional and gave me several choices of room options. A very nice security guard took me around to show me the rooms he had selected for me to see. One was shabbier than the next! I finally chose a room in the \u201cconcierge\u201d section Ocotillo I believe they call it. It has a lounge, which was very nice with food and drink service and that was very nice. The room was THE PITS! Shabby furniture, tiny bathroom, skimpy towels, poor bath amenities and looked dirty. The bathrooms \u201chave been remodeled\u201d I was told. Wow, they need to send their CEO to stay in a room and test it out. The shower didn\u2019t even have a place to put your shampoo! The toilet area was so small you practically had to go in sideways. No first class AT ALL. The furniture was chipped, fingerprints and stains and very skimpy amenities. A robe, but no slippers! Cheap pads and pens and no bottled water included. There was NO turn down service, none! And this was the \u201cconcierge\u201d building! Amazing that they are still in business. The bed was uncomfortable and the lines less than first class. Mind you the room rate was over $300 a night so I expected first class everything. Even the fan in the bathroom was the cheapest possible and noisy! The \u201cimproved\u201d (so I was told) Internet did not work; fortunately I had an air card on my laptop. The property is beautiful, very spread out and poor signage to direct you around. I do have to say the food in the restaurants was excellent; however again, the service was hit or miss. Every day I had breakfast in the caf\u00e9 and there was no salt and pepper on the table and had to ask for it each time. The service was not at all 5 star. All in all, I would say this was the low point of my visit to Phoenix and I had such high hopes, a real disappointment! Also, watch your bill, they add on a \u201cresort charge\u201d for nothing and charge for self-parking in a cramped far away lot, amazing that they are still in business!

Upon check-in, we were \"upgraded\" to a villa--a huge one-bedroom condo with full kitchen and living room. Looking back, I wonder if this was wise as we found the villa in need of refurbishing (the carpet was worn, furniture beat up--all in strange cold white colors). The shower ledge for soap and shampoo was broken. No magnifying mirror in bathroom. No turndown service (was this an oversight?). The villa was also a good one-third mile away from the main bldg. with all our activities. However, it was very quiet, which was nice. There were several small pools with little activity and a main pool with a slide with alot of activity. Personally, I found the main pool a zoo. At least The Four Seasons has an adult -only pool and is very tranquil. The service at this hotel was outstanding. Very first-class, and we found the food to be good, although it was buffet type for the business crowd. We did not dine in the restaurants. All in all, we enjoyed our stay, but would never go back.

The first two years we enjoyed very much even though the stay is quite pricey. This year we found the service was slow and not as top notch as in the past. It's a beautiful resort and great venue for our conference each year. There are a number of meeting rooms for business meetings or special occasions and the grounds are perfect locations for outdoor gatherings. Sunset is especially beautiful with fire pits and large outside seating areas for food or drinks or admiring the mountain views. The 2 bars are great places for socializing and are easily located off the lobby. The property has 39 acres with a variety of lodgings. From cottages (small but cozy)scattered about the spacious grounds (some with jacuzzi and private grassy areas that would be perfect for large family reunions), to small rooms located inside the main buliding, or larger rooms located in outer bulidings (many of the outer bulidings have separate swimming pools), or the larger villas. There is a terrific spa with a very well equipped gym and about 7 or more tennis courts. The property was built in the 1920's in the Frank Lloyd Wright style with art deco furnishings in the accomodations as well as the puplic areas of the resort which are all very well maintained! There is a lot of hisory behind the walls of the Biltmore from it's beginnings to it's famous guests list. We have stayed in the Terrace Rooms (with a small quiet pool for guests) which have either ground floor private patios or private balconies on the upper floors. We always request mountain views which are magnificant at sunset. The rooms/bathroom are separated and large. The furnishings are in soft tones. We have never found the rooms to be less than clean and comfortable.....I'm very fussy about the condition of my room and have never had a complaint. We have also stayed in the newly renovated Ocatilla building that's considered a \"hotel within a hotel\" because of the concierge service and a separate room that serves complimentary snacks and drinks at certain times of the day along with other amenities that are only offered to guests in that building. These rooms are very spacious with an abundance of light from the french balcony on the upper floors (floor to ceiling sliding door) or the patios on the ground floor. The Ocatilla building has it's own fountain & large pool which much more tranqil than the main pool (the main pool has a large water slide, cabanas, and a Cabana Club Restaurant - great for families). The bathrooms, in the Ocatilla rooms, are tiled and very nice with a separate toilet room (very very small - 2 1/2 foot by 5 foot - too small for a large person), double sinks, large shower stall and good size bath tub. The iced water dispensers around the pool areas are a real plus especially when the weather in Phoenix can be very HOT!!!! The children's play area is very well equiped and the resort has a children's day care with supervised activities for all ages. The shops are extremely over prices - better to go to the mall down the road. The cafe is a great place for light food and Starbuck's coffee. The Frank & Albert's restaurant and the Wright's at the Biltmore have wonderful food. My husband is a foody and we found the restaurants' chefs had put together a yummy variety of dishes. Even though the service was a bit slow, we really enjoyed eating at both restaurants. A private town car from the airport was $35 one way. Overall, this is a lovely place to visit.....at least once.

It is an historic building (Frank Lloyd Wright and all) - as evidenced by its reputation and by the framed newspaper cuttings. Unfortunately the history is often hidden, with an explanatory tour of the hotel for guests only occurring once a week. - location - It is not particularly close to anything because it was originally built to be out of town. Since then the town has caught up with it so where once (in the 30s) guests would have been surrounded by orchards or desert, it is now surrounded by suburbs (and a golf course). It still has a spacious desert feel. facilities - the facilities are good - the restaurants are excellent particularly breakfast. The staff are generally friendly and pleasant.

The pizza my wife ordered was bland and unimaginative. I've had better frozen pizzas. The Arizona cheese curds were a nice treat; at least the first third.

The suite: The carpet was filthy. I'm not talking about a little dirt or a few spots. The carpet behind the door and along room edges was off white, nice and clean while the traffic areas were dark and grimy. The sheer curtains dark and dirty at the bottom edges.

Even though we live in Arizona, this was our first time to the Biltmore. It is a beautiful, historic hotel and resort that is tucked away quietly in the middle of a busy city. We were there for a conference and were lucky to be able to secure a very good rate for the room. I was very excited to be staying there for the first time! The grounds are beautiful and it was amazing to see the photos on the wall of the resort in its prime! There were so many very cool people who have stayed there and this resort is certainly part of our heritage in our beautiful state. The staff was very friendly upon check-in. When I went to my room, I was under-whelmed to say the least. It did have a very nice view of the golf course, but was extremely dated and very worn. I checked out a friends room, only three doors down and was interested to learn that he had a nicely renovated room. Since I was planning on having a young visitor I asked the front desk if I could have a new room. They were very helpful and showed me a few rooms until I found one that was more suitable for my needs. I got help from a nice bellman and got all my stuff to a new room. I thought I was in heaven until I saw that there was no soap in my room and there were used towels in the bathroom. I tried to find a member of the cleaning staff who could understand my desire to have the room cleaned and finally found someone who understood what I was trying to say. I then left for awhile to go to class. When I returned to the room I thought it was hot, so turned down the A/C. Nothing, still very, very hot in the room. I then went rinse something out in the sink and the plunger broke, not allowing the water to drain. I called the front desk and the sent someone immediately to fix the stuff. He quickly fixed the sink and said he thought it may take awhile for the room to cool down. A short while later I got a call from the front desk to ensure that everything had been fixed. I told them that the sink got fixed, but the room was still very hot! The immediately offered to give me another room. So, once again, I packed back up and moved to a very close room. This one had working A/C and was heaven! That night I went to bed and hear the toilet running constantly. I was embarrassed to call the front desk and complain again, so I left a note for the maid. When I came back to my room the toilet was fixed. However, one flush and it broke again. Again, I was tired of complaining, so I took the lid off the tank to see what the problem was. The toilet needed a new flushing mechanism. I ended up leaving the lid off the tank the entire time and literally lifting the chain to manually flush the toilet. We ate several times at the Frank and Albert's restaurant. The food was fantastic each time, but holy cow the prices! $4 for a soda.....really? If you go to this restaurant, please ask for VICTORIA! She was one of the best servers we have had anywhere. Very helpful and friendly. She helped us entertain our young daughter and went out of her way to ensure we were happy. I guess that people who are fortunate enough to stay there and pay the normal rate don't blink an eye at a $50 breakfast, but for us it was a bit steep. The food, like I said was great, but a bit much for our budget. I will come back for special occasions for sure though! All in all it was a really fun stay.

The Biltmore was offering a nice package, the \"All-Inclusive\" that offered an upgraded room with 2 Queen beds plus Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner vouchers, PLUS the resort fee they typically charge. For $259- includes taxes, we had a fantastic room in the Ocatilla building (including the Executive Lounge) and our meals 'almost' entirely paid for. The Ocatilla building is an upgraded 'hotel within a hotel' building. The building has alot of historic pictures of famous vistors, is very quiet and our room was VERY comfortable. The Ocatilla also has an executive lounge on the 1st floor that had tea/lemonade provided all day; a continental breakfast that included fresh fruit,juices, coffee, granola and muffins. (Full breakfast is available in one of the restaurants). In the evening, the lounge provided a variety of small plates, chicken quesidilla, cheese/crackers, veggies and dip, sodas, and wine. Ocatilla also has it's own pool as well. For dinner our first night, our all inclusive voucher completely covered our meal at Frank & Albert's and my husband had a HUGE prime rib, broccoli and a baked potato; I had a chicken/goat cheese flatbread- included mandarin oranges and was very yummy; and our daughter had the kids \"burger sliders\" with a salad and fries and a scoop of ice cream for dessert. We also each had 1 glass of wine; again, was completely covered by our all inclusive voucher. We then visited the huge \"Paradise Pool\" to watch the movie of the night, \"The Incredibles\". All the kids were in the pool on floats; this is a free event and was quite fun! For breakfast, we ate at Frank & Albert's again. My husband and I ordered custom omelette's and our daughter had the kids waffle. Our voucher completely covered breakfast, including tip. Lunch, we were just $11 short on the voucher; my husband had the Fish Tacos (which he said was \"the best fish tacos he's had in his life\"; I had a cobb salad and our daughter ordered the slider again; we both also had wine for lunch. Note on the Paradise Pool; there is a fantastic \"water slide\" for the kids, but it is only open from 11a to 5p this time of year; so we had to work around our swim time since our daughter REALLY wanted to spend time on the slide. Towels were plentiful and there were chairs available in the shady areas (it was 117 this weekend!) The pool had cabanas available for rent that appeared to have bathrooms, enclosed cool areas and misters avaialble; but we did not check on pricing. There were quite a few activities happening; including a kids club (my daughter didn't want to visit this time); cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, etc., so seemed a very busy place with plenty to do if you want. Also, take a moment to go to the 2nd floor of the main building. There are many little 'living rooms' around to visit and listen to the amazing piano player in the lounge downstairs. The Frank Lloyd Wright details are amazing- especially if you appreciate architecture. Wonderful history here. Lastly, my husband enjoys golf, and played the Adobe Course for just $27! (Resident rate and a special for the 4th of July). Free high speed is part of the 'resort' fee. Valet parking (with in/out priviledges) was $27 per day. You can also self park for free; but in the hot arizona sun, we appreciated someone else going and getting the car.

I had not stayed at the hotel prior, and was unsure of what to expect of the resort, particularly considering that I was not attending any events at the hotel (I was simply using the resort as a business hotel). The major take away for me is that the property is beautiful, but unless I was coming back for an event on property, I likely would not go back because as a resort it isn't really designed for a typical business traveler (e.g., a lot of walking to get to your car, parking is far away, resort fee). If I was traveling for pleasure, I would check to see if there were any large meetings and avoid those dates to ensure a calm, quiet stay. The hotel is lovely and particularly beautiful at night. The lobby is lit up well, and can be a very comfortable work/social area. Valet parking is easiest, but at about $27/night I chose to self-park. There are limited spaces in front down a long row that I managed to use for a few days, but otherwise I had to park in a garage which is a good 10-minute walk from the entrance. The property has several restaurants and bars, and in the middle of the resort there is a decent amount of outdoor space that offers seating with fire pits for a relaxing evening. There is a coffee shop/Starbucks on property which was nice when needing something quick in the morning, but like everything else on the property the prices were on the high side -- I think my coffee and bagel was $10. I found the service overall to be about average. I didn't find that anybody was going out of their way to provide a memorable experience. When I checked-in I was not recognized as a Gold member nor were any benefits offered (I had to ask). After asking, as a Gold member I received a room upgrade (to the Terrace area) and 2 alcoholic drinks in the bar (up to $14 each). I also was given 2 free waters from the mini-bar. The room was very large and comfortable, but very traditional. I think the room could benefit from a facelift, bringing a few more modern elements to the room. Nonetheless it was quiet and I slept very well on the typical Hilton bed. It had a nice patio, a huge bathroom with separate make-up area, shower, and large closet.

He isn't the \"official\" architect, but his influence is apparent (he was \"consulting\" arch). We vowed to come stay here. I brought my husband here for his birthday and it was perfect, he had come here as a child for Christmas and never forgot it. I can see why. The architecture is magnificent as was the service. Okay, they upgraded us to a Villa, I think partially because we were celebrating a birthday, which took everything over the top. The grounds are top notch and pleasant to walk around. The food at the restaurants was incredible. I could hang in the main building all day, it really is magnificent (I'd better come up with another adjective). Go upstairs and check out the Biltmore History room and just marvel at all the nooks and places to sit and enjoy another vantage point. This resort does take you to another time and place - you definitely get out of the main stream and settle into another world, which makes it a great vacation spot. We got a great deal - search the web site for specials and packages, it is well worth it. We had 3 meals thrown into our rate, and since the resort was the destination we took advantage of it, which made this wildly affordable. Here is what we liked: The Spa area was fantastic: a full gym and locker room facilities for every guest which include steam, sauna, whirlpool, outdoor quiet jacuzzi, classes and tennis courts. I had a message and it was lovely. Our package included 30% off spa treatments, which was a good incentive. All the restaurants had very good food. Frank and Albert's, might have been our favorite. Lots of organic, fresh tasting food at very reasonable prices. Indoor and outdoor seating. We also ate at Wright's which was gorgeous and also very good. We thought the prices were not bad for the quality of the food and the ambiance. It was my husband's birthday so we splurged (our deal included $100 toward dinner and that paid for most of it, like I said, it was an unbelievable package). They even gave us a free souffle for dessert! The Villa was unbelievable, 1200 sf, 2 patios. We had reserved a premier king room with a balcony and view. I won't be able to afford a villa on my own ($1200/night) but it was so nice of them to upgrade us without us even asking. Shows the care of the staff in general. We just seemed to get stuff without asking, like they wanted us to have the best stay ever. There is a fantastic main pool with a FLW inspired slide. There are also other pools on the property. You have croquet and a large lawn chess set. There is lots of patio seating around the resort, a nice bar, a casual cafe, a pool bar and cafe. It is just a great place to sit and unwind. We wished we could have stayed another day. There also have plays and concerts. We had just missed Randy Newman and the night we were there they had productions of both Midsummer's Night Dream (outside) and The Importance of Being Ernest (inside). There was s'mores making for kids on Friday night and lots of activities to keep you happy, if that is your thing. We got the deal we did because their slow time is end of May through the summer when Phoenix gets hot. It was going up to 100 degrees when we were there, but it wasn't unpleasant and with the beautiful rooms to hang in, the pool to cool down in, and all this resort has to offer as far as service and design - it is all good.

We spent 3 days on the property leaving only to take a tour of Taliesin West (Wright's home and current architectural school less than 20 miles away) and we were constantly discovering new wonderful aspects of the hotel. In addition to the main building, there are 8 pools (have to go back to swim in the rest of them!) 2 full service restaurants (don't miss the lobster bisque and souffle) and a cafe, an enormous spa, tennis courts, I could go on. Tours of the hotel are offered 3 times a week - don't miss if you can work it in to your schedule. The grounds are so extensive that despite the fact we were there on a very busy, booked weekend, it was easy to wander the grounds without seeing another person.

As it turned out there were also 3 other huge luncheon events at the Arizona Biltmore on that day. Needless to say, the traffic and the parking was a bit challenging so when our event ended I decided to take my partner for a glass of wine on the terrace and wait out the exiting crowds. We proceeded to the terrace, took a couple of very comfortable chairs and, while admiring the garden and fountain views, waited for our server. None came. After a bit I got up and went back into the hotel in search of a server. I found a young lady and asked if she could help me get a couple of drinks on the terrace. She informed me that the bar was closed so perhaps I could collect my partner and go to another \"open\" bar somewhere else in the hotel's interior. I was dismayed. The day was glorious and the very comfortable outdoor seating and views on the terrace are an imeasurably more \"luxurious\" experience than sitting in a dark interior bar. Bummer, I thought.... Another server happened to overhear us and turned to me and asked me what I wished. I responded \"two glasses of wine on the terrace\". To this he responded, \"I can make that happen!\" \"Really?\", I asked. \"Absolutely,\" he said and told me he would meet me and my partner back at the terrace. No sooner than I had taken my seat than he arrived and, after some dialogue and recommendations regarding the merits of various posssible wine selections, he took our order and disappeared back into the hotel. Soon we were sipping our wine and it was then that I noticed his name badge. \"Kevin,\" I asked, \"what is that pin you're wearing?\" Well, it turned out to be an \"Emplyee of the Month\" award. I asked Kevin if he could comment on its interesting design and he said it symbolizes the 16 Biltmore values -- which include his favorite value: Empowerment. \"This,\" he said, \"means I can take any action which I believe will enhance a guest's visit and I do not have to go through 5 layers of supervision do that. So, I can walk a few steps to bring you your drinks on the terrace\". Well, I was most impressed. Kevin could see that this customer could either acquiesce to the suggestion from the first server (and probably neither have nor remember an Arizona Biltmore \"experience\") or be granted my wish to enjoy with my partner a glass of wine on the terrace and celebrate the outdoor garden views on a beautiful Spring day.

There are some things that are really good and some things that are really bad. Good: The grounds are beautiful and kept up wonderfully. Just walking around the hotel you felt like you were escaping to a tropical garden. It was really amazing. The staff was always very friendly and helpful and we always felt welcome. This hotel has a lot of history and there are photos all over the walls of days gone by and famous people who have visited over the years. It was fun to check it out. The pools are great and the waterslide was a blast (even for adults). Bad: Our room was very small and in disrepair. I've posted photos so you can decide for yourself. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the furniture was beat up, there was mold all over the shower. In addition, the door that separated our room from our neighbors had a one inch gap underneath so you could hear just about everything in their room and I'm sure the same went for our neighbors. In other words, no privacy. Our room was right next to the main courtyard so lot's of traffic and noise at all hours. You were charged to self park your car which seemed a bit petty. Also, the service at the pool was very slow. We'd often order a drink and wait 15-20 minutes for it to arrive. They are either very short staffed or poorly managed in this department. When you are paying this kind of money for a room and for drinks this type of service is unacceptable. And finally, I left my phone in my golf cart after a round of golf at the Biltmore and when I went back to find my phone the indifference of the staff was insulting. I'm still perplexed at their response and lack of assistance. It was strange and extremely irritating. Overall, I'm glad we went to experience this little piece of history but I would not return.

Wireless is available in the lobby which is cozy but does not have good work space. No coffee maker in the room, though I learned you can get one on request - when I was checking out - my bad for not asking sooner. As is the case with most all-in-one resort properties, everything was over-priced. I paid $10.00 for a domestic light beer in the mini-bar. A glass of house wine is $16.00. Would I go there again? Probably not on a business trip- an frankly, that's not what it's there for. It was, however, a stunning property, the grounds are lovely and they have full amenities.

It was by far our best hotel of the trip, and was a wonderful way to start our vacation. When we arrived to Phoenix we rented a car and drove from the airport. The hotel is easy to find, and parking is abundant. We did get lost after we checked in because the front desk agent told us to park in a garage that was closer to our room, but something must have gotten lost in translation of the directions because after we parked we walked all the way back across the resort to find our room. We moved our car and the rest of the stay we parked right outside of our room! The first room we were given was under maintenance. After a long flight, and the aforementioned trek across the resort carrying all our luggage we were disappointed to be given a room that was out of service. The bathroom smelled of fumes, was being painted, and the bathroom was being caulked. We called the front desk and explained the issue. They brought a golf cart and took us to a new room, which was amazing! The room we ended up staying in was a one bedroom apartment style room with a full kitchen, living room, large bathroom with jet tub, and a porch. We loved having so much space to spread out and relax in. The place was perfect for a lounging couple! We used the main pool a few times (it was a little chilly out, so we didn't spend much time poolside), and we used the gym equipment each day. I got a massage at the spa, which was wonderful. The service at each place was top notch. The resort is conveniently located to just about anywhere you'd like to go in the Phoenix area. We spent time hiking, dining in Scottsdale, and gambling one night. It's not walkable to anything outside of the resort, but is driver friendly.

It goes without saying that the grounds, pools and buildings are beautiful. The main hotel has an elegance which most hotels simply do not have these days. It was the social aspect of the hotel which we enjoyed. People inlcuding the staff are very friendly. Having a drink in the lobby bar is something you need to experience for yourself. Everyone chats like they are old friends and you meet lots of guests. We stayed in a building beside the Octilla which was very nice. On the second part of our stay (we went to Sedona for 2 days) the hotel was full so we were given a room on the far east side of the grounds, opposite the main interior courtyard. Not as good, this building needs some cosmetic maintenace. I have to say the second room was much larger and nicer, however the common area (lobby) was not as nice and also not as convenient to the common areas. The kids loved the pool, pool slide, smores by the fire, chess and golf. The concierge arranged tickets to hockey games, Fiesta Bowl, Dude Ranch, restaurants and anything else we needed, they were great. For the days we did not have a rental car we used the hotel car service which I would highly recommend. Very professional and it's like having your own private limousine.

The room I stayed in was in the Ocatilla. This basically was a new building where you were charged an extra hundred bucks for a bit more space, a bit nicer bathroom, and free cokes and snacks in a club area. Whether that's worth the expense is up for debate. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. There was a decent work area and a view of the pool. There was an attempt at an outdoor patio / seating area but the execution was weak. It was basically two patio chairs looking at a pool fence. The bathroom had a large tub and a stand alone shower. The commode was in a separate, but very small, room. I'm not sure it would be great for a person who gets claustrophobic. The towels were clean and plentiful. The hotel itself had decent service. The valets were effective though didn't seem terribly efficient. The front desk staff was friendly but the place still had the feel of a convention center hotel. The gym area was nice and had lots of equipment. However, it closed early. Around 9 or 10. It's amazing how a Hilton Garden Inn can have a 24 hour workout space but a Hilton Waldorf Astoria Collection hotel has to boot you off the treadmill before the 10 o'clock news comes on. The spa was adequate but nothing to write home about. There were lots of parts that sorely needed maintenance. If you have a convention here, it's a great place to stay. If you like Frank Lloyd Wright influenced architecture (he wasn't the primary architect) it's also a nice place to be.

First off, I had to ask for an itemized bill to be printed so I could see how the charges. They had charged us a $25 resort fee, $12 parking fee, $12 porter fee and a $3 housekeeping gratuity (How is a mandatory charge a gratuity?) each day. In spite of the fact that our account had a note saying it was supposed to be an all-inclusive price of $169 AND the fact that we didn't have a car AND the fact that we didn't use any porters, it was a fight to get the clerk to remove the extra fees. She said \"this is the agreement that the bride and groom signed with the hotel, so you have to pay it\". Maybe I'm a cheap jerk, but I'm not paying for services I didn't use.

We did not want to stay right downtown and decided on the Biltmore, after all I was looking forward to the Spa! Starting with check in, which went fine...that was until they gave us a very small map and pointed...turn here and here...needless to say we did get lost and had trouble finding the room. Why would such a nice place not have someone to take you to your room the first time? We had asked for a balcony room, however when we got to the room the balcony was \"attached\" to the room next door. With me being there so much by myself I did not want that. We contacted the front desk and had no problem getting the room changed to one with it's own balcony. Of course we had to go back and find the lobby and then find our second room. The room was very nice and had a great big bathroom. The Spa...it was fantastic! I had a massage and a facial. Both the treatments and the therapists were great. It is a wonderful Spa and I do recommend it. I took the \"Biltmore\" tour of the hotel which is free to guests, and it was really interesting. I would recommend it. You learn tons of interesting facts about the era and the hotel. We ate in both restaurants. Both were very good but extremely pricey. Now don't get me wrong we like a good dinner, but at Wrights it was $202.00 for the two of us! It was good but it was not that good. We eat at \"Ruth's Chris Steakhouse\" here at home and while it is expensive it would have been less than that and much better. I was really looking forward to the Biltmore, and it turned out to be nothing like I expected. I was very disappointed. I expected a relaxing resort environment. What I got was a \"convention\" site. There were multiple \"conventions\" every day. You can imagine very large groups of people talking loudly together, large \"gatherings\" in the middle of the grounds. It was really a bummer. I never felt like I was at a resort. They even turned regular rooms into meeting centers so no matter where you went you never felt you were in a \"relaxing\" environment. I would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for a quiet, romantic, relaxing vacation. I sure wish I had known that, then at least I could have made my decision with all the information.

When I arrived at the airport I called and asked for a shuttle, only to be informed that the Biltmore does not provide such service. I took a taxi but was disappointed when I arrived at the hotel to find that, although there were several hotel employees standing around the entrance, they were apparently not there to help guests as they simply stared at me as I struggled to get my luggage out of the taxi and into the hotel. Once inside I looked for the HHonors registration desk which the Hilton website said was there. If so, I could not find it. Later on I found I needed some additional toiletries and asked the Concierge for help. I was informed that I could take a taxi to a drug store (according the Concierge it probably would cost me $25 - $30 each way). It was clear that the person at the Concierge desk was completely indifferent to my request since after telling me to go get a taxi he turned away and left.

I do not know what type of room you get when you pay full rack rate but the room that I got under my corporate rate was pretty bad. The area behind the sink was torn out due to construction, the air conditioning kind of worked and the room smelled pretty bad. Why the hotel put me in a room that was under construction is just a mystery. The construction work continued in my room (without my knowledge) while I was in meetings. I learned about this around 9:00 pm on the second night of my stay when the housekeeping staff called to tell me that they needed to bring me towels. Apparently, I had no towels because they needed to remove my towels when doing the repairs. It is unnerving to learn that people have been in your hotel room when you are not there. This is not a small resort. I am sure there were other rooms avaiable (that were not under repair) during my stay But, I am equally sure that the hotel was happy to leave me where I was since I did not complain or make an issue about the construction. Shame on the Waldorf. You do not treat customers who complain with respect. You treat everyone with respect. When I submitted my on-line evaluation form to the hotel, the general manager called and offered me a free weekend certificate to \"make up\" for my experience. I turned him down.

I come every year in October for business and pleasure. Let me begin with the positive. The grounds are always outstanding. The pools are comfortable and clean. The main restaurant is also pretty good. So that's the good stuff. I gather the Waldorf Astoria Company knows it is time to update the rooms at this property. Good chance they have not been since Marilynn Monroe was there as a regular. However, as a start they have created a boutique hotel within the hotel called \"Ocatilla\". It costs extra to stay there but you get updated rooms, continental breakfast and beer/wine in the afternoon. They also have a staff member within the building to help you. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not!! The rooms are nicely updated but lack more common amenities found in higher end properties. For example, TV in the bathroom, more than two towels in the bathroom, decent shampoo and conditioner. We actually ran out of shampoo and towels because they don't give you enough of either. The scale in the bathroom didn't work and neither did the TV remote in the bedroom. I mean, when you get right down to it, the room was about what you'd get at an average hotel... not high end \"boutique\" as they call it. But that's not the worst of it. They promote this higher end stay as having a free continental breakfast. It was about the worst I have seen. They had these tiny stale bagels that when toasted only got worse. The muffins were stale as well. The granola looked okay but they had no yogurt to mix it with... I guess just eating it dry is meant to match the dry Arizona weather. Kidding aside, I found the free breakfast just what you'd expect - you get what you pay for. But wait a minute, I thought I did pay for it with the mark up on the room. BTW, I did kindly complain to the staff person assigned to the Ocatilla and she promised to speak to her manager about at least providing yogurt but nothing changed while we were there.

Frank and Albert's has a killer happy hour seven days a week. Due to my credit card plan, we had a very generous dining credit and very late checkout. Staff, start to finish, was excellent.

The main pool has a loud and rowdy crowd. But, if you seek quiet, get a property map. The resort features a number of pools and most are empty and peaceful. The resort fee of $28 is waaaaay too high for what is offered. That included entry to the spa and fitness room. The spa was an incredible disappointment. The whole area is small and dated. The showers are also small and the doors are dingy. There is a hot tub and the decking area appears worn down. The steam room and sauna are small.

We never got one. Parking is a rip off. Self parking is $12/day. Yet, if you just park your car in the structure or the spaces around the property, there is no verification you are a guest. There are plenty of spaces, too. Just tell the front desk you took a cab! Also, beware, the staff does landscaping very early on weekend mornings. Our neighbors smoke alarm also went off in the very early morning hours. As a result of the newspaper and noise, we were given a $30 credit which seemed fair. Overall, we had a great stay.

The room had no self-make coffee pot and the 3-cup small pot of coffee from room service was $9. They charge an additional $12 for parking which seems excessive since the hotel is on a large acreage.

I have traveled the world over, more times than should be allowed in one life time. I have stayed at many wonderful and comfortable hotels, but never with the overwhelming satisfaction that I have experienced at the Arizona Biltmore. If there was ever a standard by which all other hotels and staff are to be judged against, well, this takes the cake! From the very moment I arrived on the grounds to the moment I left, I can honestly say that I have never felt more welcome and appreciated as a guest at a hotel in my entire life. I was a Captain for American Airlines for 26 years. Trust me. I know service when I see it. I kid you not. The hotel itself is amazing! It is steeped in such rich history and memories, that you literally feel the presence of such guests as Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., all US Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to the Bushes. The movie \"White Christmas\" was written on the property. Not to mention the fact the the Hotel was designed under the influence of none other than Frank Lloyd Wright himself and his apprentice Albert. Which brings me to the real reason I have chosen to share my incredible experience with you. It is not really the hotel that I am writing about, but the incredible people who work there and make the Arizona Biltmore, not a mere hotel, but a home... Let me share some specifics. Ok, let's begin with Damien and Jason at \"Frank and Albert's.\" For anyone who has traveled alone, you will completely get what I am about to share. From the very instant I sat down at the bar to order dinner, I felt as welcome and comfortable as I would at my own house. Damien is quite simply amazing! This guy will achieve greatness. Trust me! He is a sharp wit, incredibly professional, and treats you as if you were the first and last patron he will ever see! Damien makes you feel welcome. What more can one ask? Then there is John Watson. John is the F and B Manager for Wright's Bar. John has his act together. I hope he won't mind, but I over heard him comment on the significance of plastic cups and the impact upon a hotel's bottom line. I was very taken by this. A hotel is a business. I was struck by his obvious savvy, but perhaps even more impressed with his temperament and attitude. One evening I was having dinner at the hotel's fine dining restaurant: \"Wright's.\" I was having dinner with the woman who is responsible for my coming to Phoenix in the first place. She is amazing!! But that is another story, and I'm presently allowing her to have the space necessary to figure her stuff out. Back to my glowing comments about John... So, two men were in the restaurant, and one of them was, shall we say: \"over served.\" Not by the restaurant, but by his own accord. Yes, we have all been there, and the movie \"Hang Over\" is more than familiar, but Crikey people! This guy was out of control! Now, I would have taken some primitive pleasure in causing significant bodily harm to this idiot, but cooler heads prevailed, as they are want to do, and the cooler head was none other than John Aris Watson. Let me simply say that he resolved the issue. This man rocks! Let's move to the pool bar. Christen is a young girl who serves at the Main Pool Bar. She is unusual, in that she is born and raised in Phoenix. Once again, we have another outstanding and positive personality embodied in this gem of a person! Need I say more? Which takes me to the Spa. Weary and stressed from travel, I sought refuge in the Spa. By the way, I didn't realize this during my first three days at this oasis from life in the desert, but Spa access is included in your room rate there in Nirvana! Yay! I have A.D.D. sorry. \"Flashy Silver Object look!\" HaHa... Where was I? Oh yes. The Spa. Well, upon arriving to enjoy a well earned massage, I asked the attendant at the Spa counter for help in contacting the Concierge for assistance in obtaining flowers to assist me in winning the heart of the forementioned perfect lady for me. There I go again! Shut it Joel! Lol! So, this young lady at the Spa is named \"Elissa?\" Not sure, but WOW!!! She stunned me too! Here's what happened: So, I want to order a floral arrangement to give to my future wife (Ooops!). Elissa over hears me struggling to order flowers and offers her assistance. Thank God! So, she asks what I'm looking for, and I tell her that the girl of my desire, mentioned she likes Lilly's. I live in Hawaii, I think flowers are amazing, but I wouldn't know a Lilly from a Frilly! Elissa says, when do you need them, I tell her, and just as my massage is finished, there is a knock on my changing door. The attendant tells me that there is a floral arrangement waiting for me at the Front Desk. Holy Toledo! Wow? They were amazing!!!! Did I say amazing again? Well, that's the Biltmore! Well, I have gone on too long, I'm obviously not a writer, and I am running out of attention span, but certainly not the accolades for the staff at the Biltmore that makes it not just a Hotel, but a true home away from home. (That was a run-on sentence. Darn!) If I was really rich? I'd move in tomorrow! Besides, then I'd be closer to that elusive butterfly I want to be my wife one day;) There I go again... Can't say I didn't warn ya!! Trust me. Go to the Arizona Biltmore. Stay a few days, then you, like me, will extend your visit. Again and again. Not kidding! It's that amazing. It will alter your vision of the world. Maybe you'll find your soul mate too! Relax, Play and Breathe! Joel Edwards Maui, Hawaii P.S.

This was my first time and I stayed for a long weekend with my two sisters. We shared a large and spacious room in the Ocatilla Section of the hotel and it's well worth the extra money. The lounge there provides a delicious continental breakfast, a happy hour with unlimited drinks and hors d'ouevres and later after dinner cordials, coffee and desserts. This is such a great deal and the service was tops. I got a very low rate too since it's off season. The Ocatilla concierge gave us a great recommendation to a nearby authentic Mexican restaurant, they printed up my return boarding pass and delivered it to me at my table at breakfast. I was charmed by the Biltmore. The separate Ocatilla pool was almost empty, even on the weekend, the workout room was clean and not crowded, I had no waits to get on the equipment, plenty of ice and water and towels and the spa ladies locker room was great as well. We had a roll a way for one night and they didn't even charge for it, and even though we had valet parking each day, we were charged as if it was the self parking ($12 instead of $27). I was pleasantly surprised with the bill. I have no negatives about this hotel. The grounds were immaculate and so beautiful and sprawling. It's somewhat of a walk to Ocatilla from the main building, but not bad, you pass the shops and it's a nice stroll, but hot if you're in the sun. I was pleased to no end and found no signs of wear and tear and need for a refurbishment and I can attest that our room was cleaned daily! I ran into the maid and she was so nice and accomodating, everyone was polite and made an effort to make our stay perfect!

The Biltmore is definitely last on my list. First off $28 resort which does not cover parking. Parking is $27 valet and $12 self park, so pretty much ridiculous! Additionally the fee doesn't cover much which is why I have no idea why they charge a resort fee. Besides internet services, the other options are pretty much included within the STANDARD room rate at the other resorts. And yes while the others may charge a resort fees, PARKING was included. The hotel is old and I stayed in the Ocatilla tower which suppose to be the newer section. If that's new, then I sure hate to see the old. While decent, they can't compare to the competition I stated aboved. Turn down service was awful, whereas they don't service your room just give you towels. No clean up or NOTHING. They were suppose to run bath water if you request it, never happened. Don't get wrong not running bath water is not gonna ruin my trip, just don't offer it if you aren't gong to actually do it. This is suppose to be included when you stay in this tower because again you pay more $$$$ to stay in the Ocatilla. One person though who was awesome is Jazmin with the Ocatilla Conceirge, she was very nice and extremely helpful. The Ocatilla pool is suppose to private and only for club guest. Pretty much open to anyone, so again why bother paying extra for this tower if the rules aren't enforced. The cabana rental I must say were nice if you do it during the week when they are half priced. Othwerwise, don't waist your money because you are paying double when the cabana is really only worth the mid-week price. Everything is pretty much really expensive at the resort which is to be expected, but the nickel and diming for what you get in the OLD hotel is why I would not recommend it to others. If I have to be nickel and dimed, then I'd rather stay at a newer resort with better amenities! There is no way I would pay regular price when housekeeping isn't up to part, $28 resorts fees, plus parking which is a mile away, rooms are very dated, and the daily activities they offer all hae fees attached! Forget it. Save your money and stay at the Phoenician or the others I listed. Lastly, the staff was very nice but that is to be expected for what you pay and they are just as nice at the other resorts. So again, Biltmore just doesn't cut it with the competition and for what they are charge. You can save yourself the headache and some money by staying a newer and nicer resort where they appreciate your business, and provide a GOOD expereince for what you pay.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "buckeye, AZ", "Title": "\u201cService Lousy, Parking a mile away!\u201d", "Author": "alnjudy", "ReviewID": "UR68017220", "Content": "We checked in and we were told that the parking next to the rooms were all filled up and that we would have to use the parking thats a mile away from the actual rooms!

Each year we look at other places in Phoenix since we'll be in town to see family, but can't find a better mix of style, good restaurants, kid-friendly amenities and location than the Biltmore. With the addition of the Frank and Albert's casual restaurant, things have gotten even better. In the past we'd leave the resort to eat lunch or dinner at the nearby Cheesecake factory or California pizza kitchen because the resort lacked a kid-friendly restaurant. This year we booked an all-inclusive package that was terrific and so we ate about 10 times at Frank and Alberts and never exhausted the options. The food was really good--mostly organic fare, fresh ingredients, nice presentation--and the restaurant is very big with nice outdoor seating so we never felt like we were bothering the adult parties in the restaurant (a separate bar area helps, too). Our girls loved the paradise pool and playground, my husband played a round of golf (a bit pricey at about $300 covering greens fees cart rental and rented clubs but very nice), and I got spa treatments. In particular we had great service from Adrienne at Frank and Albert's and Judith at the squaw peak lawn. The only downside is that lovely grounds are very spread out I wish I had brought a double stroller--getting from place to place is real hike and my girls occasionally fought over who was going to be carried and who was going to ride. And housekeeping usuallly comes late in the day so it can be challenging to coordinate naps; we opted to let the girls nap poolside in the shade, which was fine. In all though, service was terrific and we'll likely return next year, particularly if they offer the all-inclusive package again.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tucson,az", "Title": "\u201cHigh priced inconsistency\u201d", "Author": "durigirl1", "ReviewID": "UR60644288", "Content": "There is not doubt this is a beautiful setting with amazing architecture.

The hotel is an amazing historical treasure. I really enjoyed walking around and looking at all of the photos of the hotel through time. There are some spectacular aspects to the property including the architecture and the grounds. The pools are all quite nice, but were crowded on our weekend stay. If one wanted a chaise lounge by the pool, you had to be down there to \"claim\" it with a towel and book by 8am... This was a bit too much \"cruise ship\" lack of quality to me, not what one should expect at a Waldorf Astoria. The rooms were quite acceptable... I can understand where someone would say that they need to be re-done, however, they are truly appropriate for the time period in which the hotel was built. The decor (very Frank Lloyd Wright, straight line and plain) appears bland, however it is correct for the hotel design and period of acrchitecture. The grounds are AMAZING and kept to perfection. The bathroom was very nice with a rainfall showerhead. The linens were first class, triple sheeted, with high thread count cotton. The bathrobes were equally nice. Finally, the restaurant was wonderful (Wrights). This was one of the most imaginative dinners for a truly classic hotel. We enjoyed the Chef's Tasting Menu with the WIne Pairings and found both felt that it was one of the best \"hotel meals\" that we have ever had. The sunday brunch was equally nice. The bottom line is that the hotel is really a true slice of American history. The architecture is fabulous, the rooms are very nice, and the grounds are amazing.

Since we were staying in the USA for about 3 weeks, we thought we'd arrive at the Biltmore a couple days early. I have been here approximately 28 hours, and this is my review so far - it will take something magical to change. I will preface this by saying the landscaping and gardens are beautiful; but thats where the beauty stops. For starters, at check-in, there was no friendly greeting and an early check in was \"sighed\" at, due to the inconvenience, despite 4 other people checking in early before us. They initially did not give us directions to our room, no map of the \"resort\" and no information regarding the breakfast. When we arrived at our room, their \"standard\" room we've come to learn, we realised our room was far from the quality expected of a 5 star resort. there were wet patches from steam cleaning (still damp today); no coffee making facilities (I thought even 2-3 star hotels had this); modern LCD tv but the rest of the room has not been updated in over 10 years. You could not even bathe two toddlers in the bath it is so small. There is no WiFi in the rooms, only a frayed ethernet cable which I refuse to plug into my $2000 laptop. Our next revelation came when we found out the only bus service is the hotel shuttle which takes you to the only near by \"mall\" - a few restaurants and shops but nothing to write home about. Had to walk an additional 2 miles to buy bottled water at a CVS since the hotel wishes to charge $US8 a bottle. Due to the hotel having 2 conventions on and the wrestling fans arriving, no rental cars are available on site, so we are now on a waiting list in case one is available today otherwise have to wait till tomorrow. That will mean that 2 days accommodation and stay in Phoenix have been wasted doing nothing. Any attractions are a $US25-50 one way taxi fare away. Upon approaching the duty manager and multiple different concierge for assistance, we have been laughed at; looked down upon and not offered any advice or assistance. We have stayed at multiple 5 star hotels that the concierge teams go above and beyond to assist their guests - apparently at the Biltmore, unless you are a rich golfer or doctor, you're not a worthy, respected guest. I really dislike this hotel. They need to learn customer service; we've met one nice bellboy and that is it.

I live in Vegas and have seen 5 star/5 diamond hotels, but the Biltmore is so architechturally different and unique and the grounds so sprawling, our room was huge, probably 1000 square feet, with a pool view, plush beds with good sheets, huge plasma TV, everything you need in the gorgous, modern bathroom, huge stone tiled shower, walk in closet. Prompt room service, rushing up just to bring a toothbrush and toothpaste. Fantastic late night room service with good food, great movie selection to order on demand.

Unfortunately, however, our recent stay there was terribly disappointing. Most all of the service was unfriendly, unhelpful and unresponsive. With the exception of a helpful bellman, one likable and funny waiter, a hair stylist, and few others, we were greeted with scowls, long waits (including for any phone inquiry), and frequent negligence. The incidents of poor service are too numerous to describe. Although our travel agent made certain that we requested an accessible room, we were put in a worn down room in the middle of the property inaccessible by car. We were taken in a golf cart past the laundry, tennis courts, far away from any services, and brought up the freight elevator since the bellman thought it would be faster than me trying to hobble down the long hallway. We were told that another closer room with a view would cost an extra $175 per night. It took a lengthy negotiation to land in a villa closer to the main building. The room was small with filthy, ripped up carpeting, a small, extremely old television and the worst hotel bed I have slept on in ages. The notice indicates that there is turn-down service, however, you will never need to call for it, since the maid staff turn down the bed in the morning. That's right, they never make the bed up completely. The poor service was more than frowning faces everywhere who acted like they were doing you a big favor to change a bill, or show you to a table. Never before have I been completely blown off by a concierge who I tipped 20$ to make a reservation for me at a local restaurant, and a hair appointment. That's right. I requested that he call and leave a message with the info at our room, but he did not. I left my glasses at the beauty salon, and the operator refused to put me through to the salon directly. I was transferred to security but there was no voice mail, back to the operator 3 times. I tried calling the spa, explaining that I was disabled and had to ask if someone could walk over to the salon to locate my glasses. The spa agent said she would, but she also never returned my call. There was an endless phone que for anything: room service, salon, housekeeping, security, spa. Terrible. The hostess in Frank's restaurant was beyond rude and unhelpful, though the food was fabulous. I will say that the food at the Biltmore was consistently superb: Frank and Al(?), the Wright room, the Cafe, room service. Do go to enjoy the grounds and the meals at the Arizona Biltmore.. Not one person inquired about our stay, and the rooms had no hotel survey about the staff, grounds or service, as most do. No wonder. It is clear that the management really does not care. Terrible, terrible attitude throughout the hotel. One other note about parking. Guests have two parking options: 1) valet parking in the main hotel for over $24.00 per day (excluding tips), or 2) self parking for $12.00 per day.

We have stayed in luxury hotels comparable to The Biltmore and have never experienced the indifferent service this hotel provided. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the suite was large and clean--no complaints there. However, the atmosphere in general is cold. We cut our 5 night stay to 4 nights and will never stay there again. We were promised the opportunity of an upgrade upon check-in which never happened. The clerk was indifferent at best. We had to call housekeeping two times for towels, there was never any ice, no turn down service, and had to ask for toiletries to be restocked. It was as if once we checked in we didn't exist. We were also promised complimentary goodies in our room upon check in--there was nothing. Also, be prepared for a hike to your room from the parking lot. It got worse one night when there was a wedding and valet parking \"reserved\" the majority of nearby parking spaces for themselves. I started watching the staff and I noticed that their demeanor in general was not welcoming. I didn't see many smiles.

They advertise as a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired hotel...and, believe me, it is. Everywhere you look, you really are in the man's world. If you like architecture you'll be in awe during your whole stay; every detail has been thought of....amazing. Take a long slow walk our the hotel grounds, you'lll get to see all the pavillions. Tips : If you choose to park your car yourself, in the section to the left of the main entrance (where the condos and townhouses are located) you HAVE TO come back all around the main building and enter through the main entrance and lobby; we did not think of doing that, took the short cut through the pool section and went in by a side door... So, around the main building, you go in by the main door, first you get a peek and two of FL Wright's Midway Gardens statues outside, then the famous 6' high glasswork (inside) and walking to your right, you get to the main - exquisite, redone by architects of Taliesin West in the 70th, following a fire - lobby. Our room was on the third floor in the main \"historic\" building. They said it was an upgrade for Hilton Honors members, we had also booked as CAA/AAA members. Our total cost of 427$ included one night for 2 people, small king size rool, amazing terrasse - front of the building, free (but slow) internet access in room / terrasse, 2 free drinks at the Frank's bar, a few extras and tax...Worth every dollar !! The next morning, we had breakfast at their Albert & Frank restaurant : great food; this newer building reminded us of FLW's japanese work...worth a visit.

When we got to the room we found that it overlooked the hotel laundry, a road and a fence (some people must have curious taste when it comes to views). When we complained to a different desk clerk, he took matters into his own hands and upgraded us to a lovely suite overlooking the Paradise pool. Similarly, the waiter who served us our first breakfast was especially accommodating, going over to the (more expensive) cafe to get us some food that was not presently available in the restaurant. The next morning our different waiter was so clueless and useless (how hard is it to bring over coffee and toast?) that we decided to eat outside the hotel after that (try the adjoining golf club restaurant -- it's much better and cheaper). Finally, there were several conventions in the hotel and it was very noisy and very crowded in the public spaces, which clashed with the natural beauty of the hotel and its grounds. Bottom line is if you're lucky and get the right people to attend to your needs, and if the hotel is not so crowded, you're very likely to enjoy your stay.

We're huge Frank Lloyd Wright fans, so staying in this Wright-inspired Arizona landmark made it all the more fun-- and impressive. The hotel offers free 90-minute history tours where you can learn lively and facts about the Biltmore during its early years. Our tour guide, Laura (who works in accounting) was terrific. We were lucky to stay in one of the cottages original to the hotel which, although 80 years old, were beautifully renovated, spacious, and absolutely charming. There are many other room options that seem equally appealing, including a stay in the original hotel with its magnificent architecture, decor, and appointments. Everywhere you look, there's something to feast your eyes on-- from the magnificent back-lit stained glass panel at the hotel entrance to the signature Biltmore blocks gracing every building. No decent review would be complete without commenting on the food at the Biltmore. The new Frank & Albert's casual restaurant offered delicious and creatively prepared fare at a good price. You could spend your entire hotel stay dining at the hotel and we practically did! Really, there didn't seem any reason to try other restaurants-- the food at the Biltmore was that good (not often the case with other hotels). The staff at the Biltmore were friendly and helpful. From the extremely courteous and friendly desk staff and concierges to the hardworking housekeeper who cleaned our windows every day (yes, she actually wiped down the glass panes inside and out), the people couldn't have been nicer. The restaurant staff was courteous and well-mannered, providing A+ service at every meal. If this review sounds a bit gushy, that's because I'm truly in love with the Biltmore as a place to stay in Phoenix.

The physical draw to this property is obviously compelling. Anyone who understands the background of this hotel, knows the architectural history and lore. Not only does the careful preservation of this unique aspect deliver - the unpretentious prestine flavour of the grounds creates an atmosphere that I have yet to experience at any other reseort - and I have been to over 50 resorts. The physical product remains consistent with the over physical nature of the property. Well, thought out attention to detail without the intensity. A few areas of wear and tear expose some cracks in the walking concrete paths around the resort. Probably a tough thing to keep up, but it is noticeable in comparison with the prestine feel of the grounds. I stayed at the \"hotel within the hotel\" - the Octatilla experience. For me, as an experienced traveller, this is worth the upgrade. The room design feels like a 500+ square room with the best bed in the hotel world. The sleek, slim TV wall mount, great desk working area, and plenty of storage all well designed to leave lots of floor space for a very open feeling room. The Octatilla bathroom contains his/her sinks with plenty of counter space (I did not travel with my wife, but I know she would have appreciated the counter space), nice soaker tub, complete with \"Zen\" bath salts and a separate stand up shower. To top off the physical ambience I was lucky enough to have my own small terrace. With 90 degree weather every day, the terrace was a great feature. The hallways were well lit and aesthetically pleasing - again without the intensity or the \"trying to hard\" element of say W hotels or some other resorts. The room product was very clean. The Octatilla comes with access to an executive lounge. The physical space here is once again well thought out and designed. A great blend of outside terrace seating (with standard tables and relaxing cushioned seating) mixes with inside board room tables, comfy living room sofas and also restaurant style seating. Two LCD panel TVs which help add to the atmosphere without the sense of intrusiveness. The lighting and decor makes me want to take a lesson in design! The lounge also has two computers and can be used for printing and boarding pass documentation. Octatilla also has a more private pool that literally sucked the stress right out of me. Day beds, regular loungers and Cabanas all available and easily accessible. Service- While the physical product is extremely compelling, the service experience what among the most genuine I have ever seen. Somehow the culture of this hotel transcends beyond the Waldorf Astoria expectation. The service staff seem genuinely happy to work there. The staff in the Octatilla executive lounge absolutely made my stay a memorable experience. They seemed genuinely interested in me and what I needed...again without a sense of intensity or insincerity. In fact, the day prior to my check out, they took the iniative to call my room and inquire what arrangements I required to better assist the departure process. The food offering at the executive lounge was quite substantial with a very healthy breakfast offering (important to me), and unique and creative evening hors doeuvres. They supplied some nuts and snacks in bowls throughout the lounge. The only thing I would suggest here is that I saw bare hands of other guests go into the bowls - yikes! The centre piece lounging area of the resort faces camelback mountain. The seating design and atmosphere set here was quite enjoyable. I had dinner here two nights. The ambience was unmatched with the firepit conversation areas and glow lighting. However, I would suggest offering a slightly more extended food offering in this area, although I appreciate that the intent is to have a lounge offering. The main pool was also quite stunning physically and I liked the layout. The daybed and casita rental appear tempting, but I didn't see any users. The food service staff was exceptional, but I also wish a slightly more extensive food offering was available. The main dining restaurant was closed, but looked quite interesting to eat it. The most pleasant surprise of this resort overall was the refined, unpretentious service matched with the unique but also unpretentious design and feel. I will bring my family back for the adventure experiences (hikes, mountain biking and lots of yoga). The fitness area is among the best I have seen for upscale resorts and clearly was not an afterthought. Free weights, lots of cardio and plenty of room in this well naturally lit facility made working out easy. One can also do some laps in one of the many pools. I am running out of room for more detail on the service package, but I will conclude by commenting on the location. Easy access from the airport, to sporting events and to some of the Scottsdale night life. I would return to this resort with my family, but I would also consider using some of the hotel's very unique and cool meeting space for business meetings.

I have to say that I did not even pay for this trip (company expensed it) and i was still extrememly annoyed at the lack of value for the money spent. Aside from the expensive nightly room charge, you will be surprised to find (when you get your bill the last day) they take it upon themselves to automatically charge you gratuities for every tom, dick, and harry in the hotel- whether you use their services or not (maid, bellman, etc.), so don't bother tipping cash. I would also advise you to look over your bill carefully before you check out. Aside from myself, there seemed to be a long line of others waiting to dispute several bogus charges on their bills. They tried to charge me $18.95 labeled under \"mini bar\"- I never even touched the mini bar! After complaining at check out they took off the mini bar charge, but would not refund me the \"gratuities\", even though i explained i had already tipped in cash. They pretty much gave me an \"oh well\" attitude. The hotel itself (grounds, rooms, pool, etc.) were nice and well maintained- but the resort is extremely big and spread out, so be prepared to walk alot. There are several seating areas throughout the resort, and it was especially nice at night to sit outside with a glass of wine and relax and people watch. There are lots and lots of pools, so you should have no trouble finding one that fits your needs. The pools are also open 24/7, which I thought was nice. The cafe serves starbucks beverages at about $1 more than the regular starbucks price- but they were well made and it was convenient having it there at the resort. The food at the resort is extremly pricy, so for this reason I recommend taking the free shuttle to the biltmore fashion mall and eating at one of the restaurants there. Other than the pool and the gym (which was average at best), be prepared to pay a fee for any activity you would like to participate in. I wanted to mess around on the tennis courts (which were empty my entire stay) and they wanted to charge me $45/hour to play!!! like I said - you get more out of staying at a Best Western!For what they charge to stay here- all activites should be included!! Pheonix itself is pretty boring. The \"mountains\" looked more like large piles of construction dirt off in the distance. I did head into Scottsdale one evening for dinner, and that semed to be where everyone went for nightlife. Lots of bars and restaurant to choose from. I do have to say that the absolute BEST part of my trip was when I rented a car ($50/day) and drove 2 hours to Sedona!!!! This is an absolute MUST DO if you are in the area!! WOW! Amazingly beautiful! Lots of stuff to do (Slide Rock Park, Chapel of the Holy Cross, Cliff casino, shopping, dining, wine tasting, jeep tours, helicopter tours, sunset watching at the Sedona airport, etc.) I got more out of the few hours I spent in Sedona than the few days I spent in pheonix! IF you are planning a trip to Arizona, I would definitely recommend staying in Sedona. As a matter of fact, I happen to see a few Best Westerns smack in the middle of everything in Sedona surrounded by the gorgeous red rocks (and thats where I'll be staying when I return to this area! Atleast they give you a free breakfast!) I would not recommend this resort. They charge more than they are worth.

Bar menu was good, nice Greek salad, drinks were reasonably priced for a resort. Service at the bar was fine, a chef came out and did a salsa demonstration and gave samples to all who wanted. It was part of the Biltmore's 80th birthday celebration. So far so good..... right? .....not. Two teens we brought were VERY unimpressed witht he water slide and complained of bordom for the entire stay. The dive in movie that was promised and the kids were looking forward to didn't happen. As happy hour rolled around we went to use our key to get into the executive lounge (that is supposed to come with the Ocatilla upgrade) and lo and behold, it won't work. So I make a call to the front desk and was told since we recieved the room upgrade we were not entitled to the executive lounge too. BS! I went to the front desk and had a chat with the supervisor and was given new keys and access to the lounge. We had a glass or two of wine and a few snacks (all accurately described above) and headed back to the pool area for a light dinner. We didn't feel like getting gussied up for the fancy restaurant. Apparently we showed up about 20 minutes before closing time (8PM on a Saturday night!) and the waiter took 15 minutes in an almost empty place (only one other table occupied) to even come offer drinks. We ordered some chicken wings and salads and sandwiches which took another 25 minutes to arrive at our table. The wings were completely burnt to a crisp. My daughter and her boyfriend, both veteran fine dining establishment employees, were agast at both the quality of the food and the service. After a complaint to the server, the wings were taken off the bill, but too little too late. We were offered free dessert too but know better about ordering more food from a kitchen after complaining. You never know what you are going to get Forest.

The resort itself is full of nostalgia and history. The Frank Lloyd Wright architecture is amazing, and the lobby is beautiful. Many famous people have stayed at the resort in the past, but that must be its only selling point today. The room we stayed in was dirty and shabby. The lampshade was frayed, and there was a hunk of wood missing from the closet door. The bathroom had penmarks on the wood around the counter, and there were two different kinds of mildew on the tub grout (the black kind and the slimy pink kind). Ick. On the second day, we actually caught a SCORPION scurrying across the bathroom floor! We put a glass over it and informed the front desk, and were merely told, \"My apologies, I will have maintenance remove it.\" The rest of the stay was spent checking under our beds and in our sheets to make sure there weren't more hiding in our room. There were several pools available, and we spent most of our time in the smaller pools that were away from the main hubbub. The smaller pools were surrounded by broken and faded lounge chairs and had no towels available. They could also use a good scrubbing. The main pool could only be described as community pool meets spring break. There was lots of noise and commotion, small screaming children, and lots of younger couples and singles. It was definitely not an atmosphere conducive to rest and relaxation. Many of the frazzled lounge chairs that were scattered around the pool were reserved for those paying extra for the cabanas, though we only saw a few that were occupied. Towels were hard to find, and at least once we had to wait for them to be replenished. The actual service was the worst part of our stay. It was as if the employees had been instructed NOT to smile at anyone. Upon arrival, we were given a map to our room and a key. No instruction as to the amenities available, location of the pools, spa services available, etc. The first night, we headed to the bar and had to wait forever to be served. The second day, we ended up walking out because no one ever came to serve us (although employees walked back and forth past us several times). They looked busy, but a simple, \"I'll be right with you,\" would have been appreciated. We instead walked next door to the on-site cafe for 3 bottled sodas, 2 beers and a cookie for a total of $40. The employees were odd, with simple requests (extra towels, an extra hotel magazine, etc.) being met with looks ranging from confusion to utter annoyance. As for the area, it was difficult to get in and out of the resort to find restaurants or shopping, even with a GPS. We did find ourselves in a less than desirable part of town several times, and resorted to traveling back to the area in which we stayed at the beginning of our trip (Fairmont Scottsdale--Excellent Review!!). In conclusion, if you are younger and are looking for a place to hang out, but don't have high expectations with regards to service or cleanliness, this place may be acceptable. If you are an adult looking for a clean and comfortable place to relax and get away from it all, stay far, far away from this resort.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cWonderfull for the whole family, what a blast, did not want to leave!!\u201d", "Author": "atnaak", "ReviewID": "UR36273549", "Content": "My sister and I wanted to visit some where warm!

Our best part of the trip was the care and service that we received from the staff. We had a blast at the main pool! There is a beautiful swim up bar and lounge area you can sit at, and it does not smell like many resorts that I have been to, very clean! We had a blast at the Salsa Demonstration that was presented by the Chef at pool side. There must of been 8 or more different types he made! I was very impressed at the Frank Llyod Wright architecture. Our room was poolside and what a must have with the kids!! Out the door and away we went, how fun!

We had pre-booked a room in the Ocatilla Club block as this included access to the Concierge Lounge. The hotel takes a little time to adjust to as the architecture is rather unusual and greatly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright. The block we were in (previously known as the Arizona block) had recently been refurbished and offered really superb accommodation. Everything was new and we had a large HD flat screen LCD TV in the room which was super. The Concierge Lounge was one of the highlights of our stay and Carolyn and her colleagues went out of their way to be friendly and helpful throughout our stay. (They even helped us check in online for our return flights to the UK and printed out our boarding cards as well!). We ate breakfast in the Lounge, could have tea, coffee, or soft drinks all day, complimentary beer and wine, pre-dinner snacks, and post-dinner dessert, all included in the room rate. We did have one meal in Wright's, the main restaurant, but this was a little disappointing for the price. (There are plenty of good local restaurants a short drive away). We were slightly upset that the pool at the Ocatilla was being renovated (and we had not been advised of this when we booked) but there were several other pools. The Paradise pool was the main pool and quite busy (towels only available here), the historic Catalina pool was fairly quiet, but we discovered the Saguaro pool which we had completely to ourselves for two whole afternoons. The hotel was celebrating it's 80th anniversary and we went on a fascinating (and free) historic tour of the hotel which lasted about 90 minutes. The AAA rate for the room which we had booked via the internet was $152 per night including the resort charge. With taxes we paid $170 per night, which we thought was excellent value considering all the extras we had through the Concierge Lounge. The booking stated that there was a daily charge of $12 for parking, but we were never charged this. This hotel was great and a little different from the normal chain type hotel accommodation. It is a great location and very well maintained. I would not want this to be my only experience of staying in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, but it was certainly an experience not to be missed.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis", "Title": "\u201cFS/RC Level of Service - OUTSTANDING!\u201d", "Author": "td2926", "ReviewID": "UR35871021", "Content": "First some background of my wife and I to help you identify with our travel pattern for this review. I am corporate mgmt type for a Fortune 100 and my wife and I travel a total of about 70 nights a year. We are both in our mid 40s. We typically stay at Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties and occasionally Peninsula and Mandarin Oriental properties in Asia. When these aren't available we usually will stay at Grand Hyatt, Sheraton Grand, Walfdorf Astoria Collection, Conrad, etc. I must admit that I often use TripAdvisor pre-trip, but have never once written a review...until now. Now for our experience at the Arizona Biltmore from 7/22 -7/26: I think the other folks who have described the property itself are right on the money with the overall beauty and location of the Arizona Biltmore. The history behind the location and the buildings themselves are wonderful, the pools and cabanas are excellent (fun waterslide even!), the Links course at the golf course is extremely nice and challenging. I won't spend time here as everyone seems to love this part of the experience and we did too. I want to focus on the area that really need to be accentuated since it is less subjective - The Service Level! The Service - We were originally booked at the Four Seasons Scottsdale for this 4 night trip, but by blind luck I noticed that the Biltmore was running a 4th night free deal on their Ocatilla Club Level and at a very good nightly rate as well. We always try to book FS/RC because the service is completely over the top, nothing left to chance and all whims answered with a yes. We both agreed when we swtiched our reservation away from FS we were taking a risk, but felt that given the pool atmosphere and the history of the place, it was worth a calculated risk,especially on the Club Level. I can not possibly dojustice to the outstanding levelof service we received the entire time! The Ocatilla Club Lounge opened every morning at 6:30 with coffee and an expanded continental breakfast, but the best part was the greeting upon entry from Leo, the young lady who handles the morning crowd as lead concierge. Leo was chipper without being overly so or fake and was definitely concerned with our trip being exactly as we needed. She worked with the hotel management to secure me a comp day in a cabana for my Hilton Honors upgrade as opposed to a different room upgrade (ours was already very nice). Regardless what request my wife and I had of Leo, the answer was always yes and she always followed through. Amanda is the young lady from Iowa who woked with Leo most of the time we were there and she was equally helpful and friendly! In the evenings even with all of the comp wine, beer, and champagne to go with the delicious tapas type offerings, (not to mention wonderful desserts!) the best part was seeing Carolyn every evening who acted as lead concierge for the end of the day. Carolyn I believe is from Conn and she really LOVES her job taking care of Ocatilla guests in the warm climate of Arizona! Again Carolyn, just like Leo went above and beyond in so many ways to make our stay pleasant. And it was actually our dealings with Carolyn that made us decide to write this review. There was a hiccup with a houskeeping issue, that could have been a pretty big deal for my wife and I. But as those of you who stay at the upper end of resorts know, its not the issues that make or break the experience, its the reaction of the staff to the issue that tells the real story. Carolyn, working with management and under a quick approaching deadline, not ONLY rectified the rather complex situation, she provided us with a detailed and accurate explanation of why the issue occured, gave us both the most genuine apology for our trouble, and then with managements approval she made sure that we were both more than happy with the resolution, which I must say was way above and beyond what was expected. We then received calls and visits from management to make sure that we were satisfied with the resort's handling of the issue. Let me clearly say that along with the luxury rooms and feather beds in the Ocatilla rooms, the delicious food and drinks in the Ocatilla lounge, the gorgeous grounds and fun pool and cabana environment, all of these pale in comparison with the service we received at the Arizona Biltmore! IF you are accustomed to the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton service level (always addressed by name, over the top on requests, etc) then STAY AT THIS RESORT!", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "brixton77", "Title": "\u201cNot what I thought it would be\u201d", "Author": "brixton77", "ReviewID": "UR35755450", "Content": "I just spent three days there on a business trip.

The grounds and multiple pools are immaculately kept and the room I was in (a Garden room) was spotless with all current amenities (flat screen TV, Bose style alarm clock with holder for iPod).

As an added bonus, we got a great rate ($100/night including the resort fee!) for three rooms. That's where the excitement stopped. We had problems getting what we asked for (we are talking simple things like towels and ice), the pool was packed and ridiculously expensive with terrible service and rude people, and parking was awful. Check in was easy, however, with a baby, I needed a crib and a microwave brought to our room. When we got to our room, it was the furthest set of buildings in the hotel and a little worn out \u2013 could use some updating. I was told to use the refrigerator in the room, I\u2019d have to empty the mini bar. When I went to empty it half of the bottles were open and half drank and never replaced. Gross --- not to mention I\u2019m sure an extra charge to me. The crib came within an hour of check in without a hitch, but the microwave was a $25 charge, took 5 phone calls to get, and interrupted our baby's sleep by finally getting it at 9:15pm (11:15pm our local time) after we had been told they were out and we wouldn\u2019t get one until the next day and were already in bed. To get ice in this hotel, you need to call food service, who then brings you a little container. You can\u2019t take your ice bucket to get it yourself. When we asked the person who came if we could get more, he told us the first floor maid area had some if we wanted to go there to get it \u2013 of course this was after we had to tip the guy. In my parents\u2019 room next door, they had the smoke detector going off in the middle of the night because of a dead battery. They called to get it fixed\u2014the front desk sent an \u201cengineer\u201d who pulled the smoke detector off the wall and left the cord hanging. It was fixed two days after it was reported. We spent Saturday and half of Sunday at the Paradise pool. Our group is all early risers, so getting a chair wasn\u2019t a problem, although it was for many around us. Our problem was they don\u2019t start serving food at the pool until 11:30, and when they do, a cheeseburger is $18. A few people in our group ran to Safeway and brought back donuts for breakfast and sandwiches for lunch. We were a big group, so it would have been expensive to eat there. Upon bringing the donuts down to the pool, we were told that they served food in this area so carry-ins weren\u2019t allowed. At 8:30 in the morning the line at the coffee shop was out the door and around the corner and the pool grill didn\u2019t open for another 3 hours \u2013 give me a break, not to mention that it wasn\u2019t posted anywhere because we looked. Our family is usually a pretty \u201cgo with the flow\u201d kind of family, who gets along with anyone and doesn\u2019t say much, which is why I felt compelled to write this review when we all felt strongly about our stay. The grounds are very pretty (which you see on your 20 minute walk from the parking garage), but we felt nickel and dimed the entire stay, the rooms could use updating, and the level of service we received was barely par level and certainly not what I was expecting from a place with the reputation of the Biltmore.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNever again will I stay at the AZ Biltmore\u201d", "Author": "Nem3422", "ReviewID": "UR31036393", "Content": "Service was horrible at the pool and I couldn't even get a BandAid when my girlfriend needed one.

Ten more minutes went by and I had to flag someone else down. She told me she also was not my server but would have someone come over. Finally when someone came over to take a drink order and I asked for a menu I was informed that they had just stopped serving food!

Upon further observation, both visual and offered by the bellman, we were informed that the hotel becomes 90% occupied by the orthodox sect of Judaism at this time. For us, this meant incredible noise, children running everywhere, and worst of all, east coast manners of the parent clientele. Unbearable.........incessant cell phone usage, loud voices and general rudeness constantly.....There were no pools that were adult only and worst of all the children were often unsupervised and allowed to behave as they wished. Poolside, people would \"save\" chairs beginning at 9 am and then never sit in them until late afternoon if at all! There was also no towel service at the outlying pools unless calls were made. It was clear that management had either lost control or did not care to control the way people behave at their property. Certainly we wished we had been informed that a hotel we had believed would be a quiet romantic getaway had not been turned into a mass playground for hordes of children.

It obviously had weakened due to the climate. When I spoke to someone at the front desk, they were apologetic but the chair was never fixed during our stay. If that is the worst thing that happens during a hotel stay, I consider myself truly lucky!! Also, I wasn't exactly thrilled with Wright's Restaurant.

I had stayed before and convinced my girlfriends to go to this hotel for race weekend. A few drawbacks on service: As a Hilton Gold member, I had made one of our two room reservations and requested two beds in our room. I called about both rooms 2 weeks before our check-in and asked to gaurantee two queen beds for each room. The front desk clerk told me, quite snippily, that he couldn't gaurantee it, but it shouldn't be a problem because over 2/3 of the property had two queen rooms. I explained that this was a requirement because all four of us were running long distances - he said, no problem. Imagine my surprise when we checked in, and I was told that there was only ONE room available for us (at 1:00) with two beds; all other double rooms on the property were sold out. Despite the fact that NOT all the rooms were checked in, and we were standing there, the front desk would not, initially, find us a room with two beds for our second grouping. As it turns out, they did go through, room by room, for all the reservations, and found a single guy who had asked for two queens - and they switched his reservation - again, they said, the only one left in the property. Bottom line: If you really, really have a bed preference, you MUST have status to ensure that you receive it. I will also add that we were in the Arizona wing. Our rooms were large, though not the largest on the property (the whole wing looks bad from the outside, but the bathroom was the size of my first apartment and the beds were extraordinary, plus we had a balcony with a great view of the mountains). We hit up the large pool by the spa the first day, but despite the fact that all the cabanas were empty, there wasn't a single lounge chair to be found. Tip: get to the pool early if you want a seat, OR go to the pool at the Arizona wing, which is empty all day. Finally, for dinner nearby, go to Chelsea's Kitchen or Postino's - great fresh food that makes your trip to Phoenix unique.

When we arrived, we decided not to valet our car and parked in the self-parking lot. We knew that it would be a long walk, but the self parking lot was a good 10-15 minute walk from our hotel room. At night the lot was extremely dark and confusing to manage due to the odd layout of the hotel. Most concerning was the lack of security in the parking lot. The lot was merely an open, first come, first serve lot which overnight guests had to share with temporary visitors. There is no way that the hotel could discern who parked there. Despite the safety and distance issues, the hotel still charged $10.00 for self-parking. Once we arrived, we were upgraded to a cottage room but little did we know that would be a mistake. When we arrived the cottage room was decidely underwhelming for a room of that cost. The room was small and badly renovated. The bath was smaller than expected for this \"caliber of hotel.\" The heating did not work (deserts can be cold at night) and the hot water ran out after 10 minutes. Ten minutes is fine for one person but not for a family. The check-in attendant (upon upgrading our room) stated that we had a semi-private room overlooking the main part of the grounds. Well, if semi-private means hearing the honeymoon couple next door and all the drunken noises from the bar, then the attendant was right. The windows are very old, which means there is no double glazing to keep in heat and keep out sound. There was no view of the grounds because the hedges are grown so that you can't see anything while sitting on the patio furniture. You have to stand up to see anything. (I noticed this problem with a lot of the cottages.) The reason the hedges are grown high is because many of the \"amenities\" are right next to cottage rooms. The chess and putt-putt amenities touted are immediately next to the cottage rooms. This means that when little Johnny misses his putting shot, it's coming into your room. Houseekeping was pretty decent but made weird choices. One day we were given washcloths. The next day the cloths were removed and replaced by a bath mat. The mat was then removed as well. One day during our trip, we decided to drop the kids off at the \"kids korral\" touted as a baby sitting option. When we arrived, we noticed that the entrance to the \"korral\" could only be reached by the back access road for commerical deliveries. The playground was also dierctly accross the \"korral\" separated by the construction access road. Avoiding the truck was a pain, however more disconcerting was the back door to the \"korral\" (room) was open to the access road with no direct supervision. The \"korral\" attendant was seated immediately outside of the \"korral\" room. However, one precocous child trying to get to the playground through a construction access area equals disaster. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the basketball court next to the playground was open with lots of power construction tools plugged in and laying around. The hotel's costs are usually arbitrary. The chocolate cookie charged in the Cafe was $5. The same cookie at the pool was $3.50. We used the bottled water in our room listed for $6. When we checked out the same water was $7.99. The miniscule amunts for the food paled in comparison to the overpriced food. Both the Cafe and restaraunt were wildy overpriced for the quality. Also, the cafe did not serve lost of \"child-friendly \" breakfast foods , so we were forced to order takeout from the restaruant. When we ordered oatmeal to go, it was given to us in a starbucks coffee cup. The last day of our stay was the last straw. Our family got up early to pack for our trip home. I'm glad that we did because the head housekeeper opened the door to our room at 8:50 am to inquire when we were leaving (despite the hotel's policy of a 12 noon checkout time ). Besides being completely unprofessional entering our room without permission, the housekeeper actually gave us attitude for not leaving earlier! No apologies, just attitude. On the way out of the property we saw several contractors from the Hotel condo construction project fishing in the aqueduct near the property. These contractors were actually taking up self-parking spots for the clientele for fishing.

Want to play tennis on one of the seven courts? Plan on shelling out $20/hour and buying a can of tennis balls for $5 from the tennis booth. Planning on bringing your own car? (I would recommend it since there is nothing within walking distance of the resort for shopping/dining/movies, etc.) Valet parking costs $25/day and self parking costs $10/day.

That left guests to chose from room service (very expensive with gratuities tacked onto the already way overpriced food), Wright's fine dining (good, very expensive, very decadent food, not a good place for a \"light\" meal in the heat of the day and not enough vareity on the menu when it is the only full-service restaurant on property right now) or \"The Cafe\" which is really a small deli where one has a very limited selection of pastries and sandwiches for anywhere between twice and five times the price they would be off the resort property. If you don't have a car (which we didn't) you are stuck with the limited food options and the highly overpriced dining options. That said, the pools, landscaping and staff were terrific.

I have attached pictures of this area and all is can say is I felt like I was staying at a Holiday Inn! You have this nice facade, but then once you get into the inner courtyard you realize all the rooms have outside entrances and the hallways are very dark....not at all what one would expect from a \"Biltmore\"! This is an old, outdated building that should be torn down....they should not even be putting guests in these rooms. The other issue I have is with the prices of the food and beverages here. A starbucks coffee costs double what you would pay in a regular coffee shop! I understand that this is a \"resort\" but the prices were really ridiculous. One night I got all the way to my room and found that the key to my room would not work. Rather than walk all the way back to the lobby, I called the front desk. They said they would send someone to me with a new key, which they did. When I checked out I saw that I had a $10.00 charge on my bill for this service! I just think this is ridiculous!! On a more positive note, I thought the staff at the hotel were very nice and I have no complaints about the service that I received from any of them.

Even though his company was paying for it and money wasn\u2019t coming out of our pockets, we were still disgusted. The first night\u2019s hotel room was large, but the bathroom had a weird layout with a shower stall showing age, mold, and cracks in molding. The carpet stains were disgusting and plentiful-yuck. There was a huge, very noticeable tear in the desk lamp. The decorative pillow was scungy and old with fabric balls all over it. The biggest surprise for me was the scorpion that crawled out from under the bed across the floor to the window drapes while I was alone in the room!!!!!

One restaurant was closed for remodeling and the Wright restaurant had a severly limited menu of choices that were overpriced. We went out a few nights just to get decent food choices. The Starbucks Caf\u00e9 was another place to get food, but you paid dearly for items, such as coffee and bagel with cream cheese, and options limited. I know we\u2019re on a resort but do we have to feel like prisoners? Give us food choices, vending machines and soda machines too for heaven\u2019s sake.

Rooms: They had initially put us in a room in the \"Village\" area. The room, decorated with mission style furniture, overlooked a garden and was spacious and clean, with a dresser, desk, two comfy chairs, side table, king bed, and flat screen tv. Our friends had rooms with a balcony and I love sitting outside reading so I requested a change to a room with a balcony. The staff were extremely accommodating about making the change. We packed our bags and they moved them for us. When we came back in the afternoon we had been given a room with a balcony, again overlooking the garden, in the \"Paradise\" section. Again the room was clean and had a flat screen tv and king bed. It had the balcony I had asked for but it was MUCH smaller! It didn't have room for the dresser and while it was a reasonable size, it felt cramped compared to the other room. To tell the truth, I wish I'd kept the larger room! So take your pick: smaller room + balcony, larger room + no balcony. Staff: Professional, helpful, polite, accommodating. Everyone we came in contact with, from Reception to the Pool staff, was top notch. The Grounds: You will walk. A lot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but if you are mobility restricted it can be an issue. The Resort is large and sprawling so be warned, if you are in a room in one of the farther buildings and you are attending an event in the McArthur Ballroom, it's right on the other side of the property and is a bit of a hike. Lots of fountains, gardens, swimming pools, and everything is meticulously tended. btw: If anyone from the Resort reads this I'd have a small suggestion, on the way from the lobby to the Paradise building there is a concrete \"Japanese Temple\" on a rock. It doesn't look right just plopped there like an afterthought. It's an anomaly in a place as carefully planned as the Biltmore. The Buildings: The Resort itself is beautiful and it was a pleasure to stay in a place that had been designed with such style. We noticed that as sometimes happens in Wright's work, style occasionally triumphs over function, but it is lovely nonetheless. And ignore the picky people who complain about the carpets, plastic toilets in the rooms or whatever. Some people can never be satisfied. It's a beautiful and extremely well maintained Resort, and it's a pleasure to visit. And finally, I must mention the room service. If you have any choice, don't. We had to order in one evening because my husband was feeling ill. I love french onion soup and was eager to have some because I was sure that in a place as prestigious as the Biltmore, it would be real french onion soup. Can I tell you how disappointed I was to taste the same nasty oversalted \"beef\" soup base I can get in any restaurant? I sent the first bowl back because it was so salty it was inedible. The second bowl seemed almost as bad as the first but I was starving by the time it came and ate it anyway. The gruy\u00e8re cheese on top was correct and lovely, but the overall it was very disappointing. One bowl french onion, one bowl chicken noodle, one grilled cheese, one small milk, one cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e = $50. Expensive and disappointing.

The main building is architecturally stunning and the landscaped grounds are off the charts beautiful. In addition the staff are very well trained, extremely polite and respectul, and actually seem to really enjoy their jobs which is reflected in their attitudes. My wife and two children came with me to the conference and they had a great time. The Biltmore has several pools including one with a large water slide. The pools by the way are open 24 hours a day.

The concierge service was incredibly helpful to me as well, booking an excursion for my family to Sedona, getting baseball tickets to the Diamondbacks game, providing directions to the hiking trails, and printing out our boarding passes. My only complaints, which are minor, are that the food and drinks in my opinion are overpriced, even for a high end resort. A bottle of corona for example was $7.50. A hamburger was $15.50. Also the resort has only two real restaurants on property which with over 700 rooms get very busy.

It\u2019s a little more costly than what we usually like to spend but we were treating ourselves. In addition to the daily room cost, they charge you a $25 daily resort fee and $10/day for self-parking ($24 for valet) and while we knew all this upfront, I believe hotels should include the resort fee in their prices instead of tacking them on after the fact. We had a great time at the main pool (Paradise Pool) and rented a cabana one of the days. We chose a \u201cClassic\u201d cabana which includes its own bathroom with shower, fridge, TV, table and chairs, ceiling fan and lounge chairs. It cost $150 for the day, which was lower than what I had been quoted, a nice treat. There is also a \u201cPremier\u201d cabana option which is $100 more- these are supposed to be on the sunny side of the pool while the Classic is in the shade. What we found was that ours was actually in the sun for a good part of the day so I was happy I didn\u2019t pay extra for the sun option. A few things we enjoyed: the grounds are beautiful and there are some fun lawn games offered for everyone including chess, checkers (the giant pieces- very fun), and croquet. There are several pools on the site and while we only used the Paradise Pool (the only one with a bar and caf\u00e9), the others also looked nice. Our room was very large with a large bathroom and a large flat screen TV (most channels were in HD). A few things we didn\u2019t enjoy: the last day we were there (Friday) they didn\u2019t clean our room until around 4pm. The other days they cleaned much earlier so I\u2019m not sure if it was b/c it was a weekend day and they were more fully booked.

We self-parked our car and under the guidance from the front desk, we used the parking garage to keep our car out of the sun all day.

It is a beautiful hotel, with lovely manicured grounds filled with palm, orange and kumquat trees. We stayed in a room in the main hotel (the original building) and the rooms were appointed with mission-style furniture and extremely comfortable beds. The service was excellent. We had an incredible view overlooking the mountain and the courtyard. In the interest of complete disclosure, I did have two complaints: the noisy groups who gathered around the fire pits late at night., which were on the main level right outside of our second story room. Had it not been for the earplugs I always carry, I would have found sleeping a problem. Also, the prices for amenities - drinks, dinner, spa, etc., were quite expensive. If you love history ,take the historical tour of the hotel offered from the concierge desk several times a week - it's fascinating.

None of my conference companions had any complaints about their rooms either (although none of them had as big of a room with a full balcony). Huge LCD TV with a large number of channels, including 2 HD channels (HBO and Showtime if I remember correctly), very comfortable bed. My only complaint about the resort is the exorbitant cost of eating there---even breakfast is outlandishly priced---and the main dining room, ridiculous. And the Resort is not really near any other places to eat (although, during the day, there is a free shuttle to a shopping mall with several semi-decent, not fancy places to eat---think the shuttle goes until 6 p.m.).

This is very much a conference hotel, but we found it was fine for tourists as well. The Frank Lloyd Wright inspired cast block lobby and buildings are very formal and monolithic compared to some places we've stayed, and the interior spaces are a little darker than some hotels. But it's comfortable and relaxing. We found the staff here to be friendly. The gardens, fountains, pools and landscaping are georgous. The hotel terrace in the late afternoon has a fabulous view of the mountains and is a marvelous place to sink into the comfy rattan chairs and have a drink - they light the fire pits when it gets cool out. The prices are a bit on the high side but the ambience is worth it. We ate breakfast and dinner at the Grill. The food was delicious, atmosphere pleasant, and there wasn't a wait to sit down. The wait staff was great - well trained, knowledgeable, polite, friendly, attentive but not intrusive. This was our first stay and they upgraded us to a room with a private balcony and a mountain view - nice! It had rained a few days prior and the balcony was filled with water. We considered asking for another room, but we liked the room so we decided to call the front desk to ask if someone could just squeegee the water. We went to get our luggage and by the time we returned, the water was gone. Someone came by a little later to give it a second sweep to make sure it was done to our satisfaction. We were very impressed with the speed with which this request was handled. The rooms are large, the furniture is big and heavy (craftsman style oak). The plant in the room was a nice touch. The bathroom was huge w/great shower and toiletries, plenty of towels, two sinks, separate area for the commode, make-up counter with a chair, and closet with full height mirror. The only complaint about the room is that the closet for the room is inside the bathroom. There are plenty of outlets in the room to charge your electronics (phone, camera, etc.) We liked that they not only have glasses in the bathroom but wine glasses and tall glasses.

Overall, we had no significant problems during the 24 hours of our stay. August is low season here but we didn't see a change in the level or quality of service we've come to expect from a Waldorf=Astoria hotel. It was 112 degrees when we arrived so we opted for valet parking ($24/day) rather than self-park ($8/day). The self-parking lots (one is covered, one is not) can be quite a walk depending on the location of your room. Check-in was quick and easy. Front desk staff were polite and formal but very helpful. The Biltmore consists of a series of separate buildings, villas and cottages accessible by meandering walkways. Some are covered, most are not. Finding our room in the Valley Wing meant wandering around and taking wrong turns in the heat because the map we were given at check-in was not helpful. Don't rely on the map, look for the small signs posted around the grounds directing you to different buildings. During low season, room rates are about 50% of high season rates. Our resort room wasn't worth more than low season rates, all very average - king bed, a couple of chairs and ottoman, desk, large closet, 42\" flat screen tv, a large patio with seating. Not much of a view. Furniture is Crafstman style and looked dated and carpet was worn. There are small signs of neglect - for example, one of our lampshades had a big rip in the fabric that was pretty obvious and we had a burned out lighbulb on the desk lamp. Bathroom had double sinks, an oversized tub and shower combo, lots of plush towels but very few hooks to hang anything on. Our room also had two very large bath robes to use. We had a good night's sleep on the comfy king bed. The A/C was quiet and kept the room cool. Walls are thin - we heard voices from a couple rooms down, a TV show, toilets flushing and showers running. We even heard someone's alarm clock go off early the next morning! No coffee maker or microwave. There's a small fridge with minibar items - $3.75 for Coke or bottled water, $3.25 for a Butterfinger candy bar. In other words, the usual high prices. About 30 minutes after arriving in our room, the kitchen delivered a small plate of 4 dessert samplers and two bottles of water compliments of the Biltmore for being Hhonors members. It was a nice little amenity. One of the pools was open pretty much all night. There are lounge chairs, tables and limited bar service. The Biltmore also has 24 hour kitchen staff in case you get the munchies at 2AM. We sat by the pool around 10PM when the temperature had dropped down to 100 degrees. No mosquitoes. We had a light breeze, friendly waitstaff. A few smokers were around but they were downwind of us. While the room we stayed in was quite average, the grounds are quite immaculate and beautiful with lots of grass, fountains, a giant chess set on the grass, the Biltmore \"sprites\" statuary and all that Frank Lloyd Wright inspired architecture. Inside in the public areas, it's almost like being in a museum. Take time to browse the hallway between the Bistro Grill and Wright's where you can see photos of the Biltmore in the early years and of the celebrities who stayed there. There are several small shops near the Cafe that we browsed through featuring high-end resort clothing, shoes, jewelry, and Biltmore souveniers. We didn't use any of the spa services. As beautiful as the grounds are, we wouldn't stay here again. Rooms are really just average and restaurant prices are quite high. The resort charges for every little thing.

I grew up in Phoenix and have always known the Biltmore by reputation; however, my only experience with the facility had been several nice meals at the restaurant at the Biltmore's golf courses. I booked the room through Hilton's web site and got a $116 per night rate (plus resort fee and tax). We got to Phoenix quite early and called ahead to get an early check-in (11:30 when check-in time isn't until 4:00). The front desk emplooyee who answered the phone was extremely courteous and accomodating. When we got to the hotel the valet staff was courteous and helpful (although we self-parked). At the front desk I was told that I had requested a king bed (this is in my HiltonHHonors profile). When I pointed out that I was traveling with my daughter the front desk person immediately looked for a different room. She quickly found one for me. I further pointed out that I planned to self-park, then she said the room she had was far from self-parking so she would try again. She then said, I have a very nice room for you but it only has one king bed. She made it very clear that it was an exceptional room and that I would like it. I took her advice. I stayed in the Saguaro Villas - what an nice room. This is a full-blown suite: 20-foot ceiling, enormous patio, floor to ceiling windows looking north to the mountains, fireplace in the living room, full kitchen, large bedroom, walk-in closet, etc. The VIllas are owned by other people and Hilton manages them when they are in the rental pool. The Saguaro villas have a small, but beautiful, pool if you don't want to be in the large pool area. My only complaint with the room (and this is minor) is that it is dated and needs to be refurbished. The maid service was very efficient. Spending time at a Phoenix-area resort in the summer is quite popular with the locals and the Biltmore is no exception. By 9:00 a.m. all of the shady spots (with umbrellas) had already been claimed at the big pool. Of course, there were no people at these spots - just their stuff. During the day the large pool was a giant party. A wide variety of people having their own fun - singles, couples, families, young and old. The swim-up bar is nice and the prices are in-line with what you should expect at a resort (and actually cheaper than what you'll pay at many of them). The resort fee entitles you to use the spa, which is a nice use of the $25. At most resorts the fee lets you use the gym but the spa is an extra charge (or completely off-limits unless you purchase a treatment). I worked out both mornings and it was nice to finish the session in the spa lounge with some fresh fruit and fresh-squeezed orange juice. My gripes with the Biltmore are minor. First, I think the hotel needs to do a better job of embracing the desert. There is way too much grass on the property - this is irresponsible from a water usage perspective and in the summer the brown areas look horrible. Second, the decorative brick with the distinctive art-deco design is in need of repair. Throughout the exterior of the hotel the brick is cracking or has fallen off the wall and been poorly replaced. We had breakfast the first morning in the restaurant and found it to be incredibly mediocre. The pancakes were as dry as the desert. Will I be going back? Probably not. Why not? Because the Phoenix area has so many wonderful places to stay and I want to try them all!

I was apprehensive about going to the hotel after reading the bad reviews here, but my friends, family and I had a great time! First of all, I don't know why people are saying the rooms where bad. We stayed in a resort King, and it was really nice. Nice bed, big bathroom and everything was clean and comfortable. It didn't seem outdated to me at all. My family's rooms where even better than mine! The hotel is divided into cottages and different room buildings, and our building had its own little pool which was quiet and nice. The hotel was pretty crazy, as we went Memorial Day Weekend and there were two or more weddings taking place, but I thought it was really fun. The large pool is a mob scene and people come and stake out pool chairs at around 7 am! If you come after 8 am, forget about finding pool chairs. It's a fun pool with a swim up bar and a water slide. My friends and family and I decided to hang out at another pool- the Arizona pool- on our first day. It was smaller and more mellow, but it had a bar next to it and was quite nice. They even had a barbeque going and we all had great burgers, chicken & fish. When my husband picked up the tab, we were amazed at how cheap it was! The total bill for our lunch for eight was under $80. The hotel also has a lot of fun activities for kids, and great extras that make it fun for all ages. On Friday night we went and had s'mores by the fire pit. They had an amazing setup of s'more stuff, lemonade, cider, and popcorn, and even had a \"cowboy\" come and sing some songs for the kids. This was a totally free event, and really fun. There is also a movie night by the pool, which we missed, and croquet, a putting green, and a large checkers/chess board by the pool. All eight of us also went to the spa for massages and hot stone pedicures and one facial. We all tried different types of massage, and everyone had a good experience. It's not the fanciest spa and in a town of great spas I'm sure it's not the best one, but it was clean, there were great drinks and snacks, and all of us enjoyed our experience there. The other issue that someone mentioned is parking. There are two self parking lots when you pull up to the hotel. One is to the right, and closer to the lobby, and the other is a parking garage that is a bit farther to the left. We found parking in the close lot a few times, despite it being a busy weekend, and the other times we parked in the garage. Yes, it was a little farther away, but certainly not a mile, and not a big deal.

Event and guest self-parking (traveler beware - this is an extra charge NOT noted when reservations are made!) is atrocious - long distances to lobby, meeting and lodging areas. The shuttle is too infrequent for the territory it has to cover. Vehicular traffic in the lobby and meeting areas is heavy at times, and pedestrian areas are not well marked nor protected. I chose not to entrust my vehicle to the valets after watching another guest's car being used to bulldoze speed bumps and potholes en route to the (very conveniently located) valet lot. Standard rooms are smallish for a resort setting and furnishings (also FLW-type craftsman designs) look dated, with visible wear and neglect.

The hotel seemed to be extremely understaffed as we noticed the same servers working full shifts at the pool and then also at the property's restaurants and lounges at night. Service was terribly slow at all of the restaurants, we waited more than 30 minutes for our waiter to bring us our check one night. On another occassion, our server brought us our drinks and when we gave her exact change (including tip), she exclaimed \"you guys are my favorite customers because now I don't have to come back and check on you.\" We sat outside at this lounge for 5 more hours that night and she never did come back and ask us if we wanted another drink. That experience pretty much sums up our whole stay. I have paid 1/3 the cost at other hotels and gotten far better service than I got at the Biltmore.

If you're a fan of mid-century modern, you'll love exploring. Be sure to peek into the conference room spaces, some with soaring gold peaked ceilings - truly unique in design. I encountered true 5-star service from all staff during my stay, including a charming houseman who greeted me in English and then, when I asked for directions to the spa, provided me precise information - in Spanish! Because of his friendly body language and gestures, I was able to infer where to go and when I confirmed it with him (\"Oh, across the pool...I see!\") he smiled and said \"Yes sir!\" This kind of interaction is sooooo much better than the typical eyes-down, mumbling \"no englais\" response one might receive at other properties. As others have noted, the Biltmore is a bit pretentious when it comes to pricing. Even in the gift shop, a 12-oz. can of soda fetches $2.50 - God knows what it is from the minibar. The Biltmore's biggest opportunity for improvement is in the room itself. Once inside it's as if you're suddenly transported to a typical Marriott in a city center location. Large armoires hold a smallish 20-inch tube TV; if they'd banish the armoire and install a proper 42\" flat screen, they'd gain substantial psychological space in the rooms. The rooms aren't tiny, but they're below 21st century standards for space. Bathrooms are somewhat cramped, but at least the tub/shower combo is a roomy six-plus-footer so even men can lie fully in the water if they choose. Rainshower heads help when taking a shower. Only a single sink but a wide vanity and an extra full-length shelf above help store toiletries over a multi-night stay. Closets are ample and lighted by opening the door automatically. Beds are new Serta mattresses in the same quality range as the Westin Heavenly Bed, and they include a substantial down topper (removable if too hot during the summer). However, the Biltmore ruins the effect by using cheap 60/40 blend sheets instead of the all-cotton sheets virtually every 5-star property uses these days. Furniture in the rooms is somewhat dated, with a craftsman style but worn and de-laminating tops on many surfaces. Decor is very desert-style but lacks color - too much beige/brown/terra cotta, not any bold color to break up the palette, even in the artwork or accent pillows. Despite the build date of 1929 (or perhaps BECAUSE of it), the room was quiet - and I was in the main building above the lobby. If in the main building, third floor, odd numbers will provide a reasonable view. In-room dining also falls far below a 5-star standard. No roll-in cart here - it's delivered on an uninspired tray with the single indulgence being a fresh-cut whole flower and long stem adorning the side. I ordered a pizza; it came in a delivery cardboard box. 5-star properties that get this right deliver on a silver platter with cover.

Admittedly, the main building's exterior and interior are stunning and worth seeing, even if you are not an architecture buff. It is probably one of the most beautiful hotel lobbies in the world. However, once you get past the main public areas, everything changes for the very worse. The rooms are not a good value (conference rate is $300) and, more importantly for me, the service is erratic and mostly well below average. My wife and I stayed at this resort for four nights, which gave us time to get to know a number of the staff, particularly those working in the lobby area. They are generally very good people, but I believe they (and, consequently, the guests) are victims of horrible service training. Too many times I had to call a manager over or begin to make a scene before I would receive the service you deserve at a self-proclaimed high-end hotel. For example, most nights it was nearly impossible to find a server on patio areas near the fire pits. Once, I went inside to the bar and asked a server for assistance. She told me that the patio was not her area and that she could not help me. I found the chief bartender and told him about my exchange. He apologized and took my drink order. Later, the server came outside and offered help; she then explained that she had been trained not to \"take over\" another server's area. I doubt very much you would ever have a Four Seasons or Ritz employee say \"No\" to a simple and reasonable request. Upon check-in, I was informed that I did not have a reservation for my first night, despite having the email confirmation with the correct dates with me. The front desk clerk was unimpressed when I showed him the email (he didn't even look at it). He commented that the hotel was full and that I may have to come back the next day. Only after I told him that it was his obligation to comply with my reservation did he offer me a suite at a discounted price. The suite was large, but, as another reviewer commented, it was appointed like an Embassy Suites. Also, my wife and I could hear every noise and tidbit of conversation coming from the closed off adjoining room (and they could hear us, too). Several ordinary requests from housekeeping went unfulfilled. I ordered some snacks and a small bottle of vermouth (retail price in Ohio is $6) from room service. When the employee finally arrived, the bill indicated that the vermouth was $75! I refused the bottle, but the employee explained that I would first have to talk to the manager. I refused to do so and sent the server away with the bottle. You get the drift. Beautiful hotel. Lousy service (more accurately: very poor training by Hilton, the manager).

The architecture of the main building is really interesting, especially at night. Worth a trip if your'e into that. However... The service on the links was awful. The architecture is not Frank Lloyd Wright, however. It's just inspried by him. Worse yet, everything except the lobby and the main common areas have been gutted beyond recognition, like by the worst common denominator 70s Hilton type mediocrity. The pools are nice, but badly updated. Even the rooms have tacky arts and crafts knock off fake furniture you'd see at an Embassy Suites. So if you want to stay here for the architecture, forget it.

Bad tomatoes, broken recipes. The shrimp was yellow, the fish and chips frozen. The staff do not respect the do not distirb signs--we're talking three or four knocks late at night kind of thing.

First, check-in was excruciatingly slow and though the reception employee was pleasant, she didn't seem to know what she was doing. I'd say we waited a full 10 minutes before she found us a room. When she showed us where the room was on a map, it looked really far away. When I asked for one closer, she said none was available, but she said that to compensate for the distance, she had given up one of the special, luxury rooms. She whispered that this room goes for $1,000.00 a night - HA! - what a joke that turned out to be. We had to walk outside to get to the room - as it did not connect with the main building. It was over 100 degrees outside and no bell hops were available to help us with our numerous suitcases. We were both sweating by the time - 15-20 minutes later - we got to the room. And the room was a joke - tiny, with poor decor. There was no way it was worth 1K per night let only $100. So, we trudged back to the reception desk, and I explained our dissatisfaction, esp. with the distance - and lo and behold - a room was suddenly available. It was still a bit of a walk, but manageable. The nightmare started on the second day when we discovered - very late at night - that our closet was flooded. All our clothes - those on the shelves and on the hangers were soaked. This was at midnight. The manager said he'd send someone to pick up our clothes and get them dried. I explained that my husband didn't have any clothes left at all since all of his had been in the closet. When we got our laundry back, several items were missing. I advised the front desk, and then a manager, who said he'd follow up and get back to me within 30 minutes. An hour later, I went to the front desk to see him, and he was chatting and joking with an employee. He hadn't even begun to do anything. I checked back another hour later, and he said he didn't know what had happened, but that he'd have the laundry manager call us in the morning. He explained that the manager got in at 6a.m. I advised him to NOT call our room before 9am. I even wrote a note to this effect to leave with the laundry manager. Well, guess what, we were awakened at 6:00 am. I was so furious. He had not found our clothes - he called just to tell me that they were still missing. In the end, our clothes were not recovered, and with no explanation as to why. On top of all this, everything was ridiculously overpriced. A can (not even a bottle) of Coke was $3.50., a stick of deodorant was $8.00. Room service was extortionate and the food at the deli and restaurant (another restaurant was closed for the duration of our stay) was mediocre at best. The service at the bar was very slow. The staff generally seemed inexperienced. The worst was the billing. Our bill at check-out was twice what it should have been. We had to delay our departure getting that settled. Much worse than that, many others in our group found excess, unexplained charges on their credit card bill - a dozen reported they were billed for additional amounts as recenlty as last week - almost 5 months after our stay!

You can tell that the place definitely had its moments of elite history, and while it may have truly been one of the most glamourous hotels back then, it shows its age in both good and bad ways. It's as if, as another reviewer noted, that management can't decide if it wants to embrace its past or evolve into some vision of a Las Vegas resort future. The lobby area is truly lovely, cozy and inviting, if a little schizo. There's clearly Asian influences, southwestern influences and, oddly enough, a sense of pacific northwest lodges here. That's the interior... the outside is a different story. The \"iconic element\" of this resort are the building tiles that cover everything (and I mean everything) all rendered in glorious greenish concrete. The property loves to drop Frank Lloyd Wright's name, and I can see the influence. That is, if FLW designed a hospital. It's very institutional and the buildings just look a bit like a very well maintained \"sanitarium\" from the 1920's. Luckily, the interior of my room was a different story. Very, very spacious and well-appointed. A few small gripes: - The desk chairs are not well padded. Sitting on them for more than 10 minutes will cause you some pain. - Their attempt at copying the \"dream beds\" of other hotels is merely a very large mattress topper placed on a cheap mattress and covered with very nice linens, which another reviewer noticed as well - The in-room safe uses a key. Get with it... time for an update. As for the grounds, if you can get past the concrete you'll notice how well maintained they are. Truly beautiful. I saw no notice of the mosquitos, cloudy pools and trash that other reviews make notice of. Simply put, they were immaculate. The service varied widely. Check-in and check out were efficient and everything they should be. However, once I got to my room a staff member was in the room making what appeared to be personal phone calls. She politely excused herself when I seemed to startle her upon pushing open the door. The bakery/cafe staff was indifferent and seemed \"bothered\" by having to serve patrons. The laundry service caused me some grief. I called very early and informed them I had some laundry to send out for same day return (promised back by 6pm). Come 6pm, no laundry. At 6:30, a call to housekeeping/laundry was met with a typical \"we'll check on it\" response. At 7:15 still no laundry, and a 2nd call got the the same \"we'll check on it\" and call you back response. At 8pm, a call to the manager on duty had my laundry to me within 10 minutes, delivered by a staff member who was clearly annoyed that I wasn't about to offer up a tip after waiting 2 hours for overdue laundry. Housekeeping also came very late-- in my case after 4pm. Dinner at Wright's was amazing. Our server, Wesley, gave nothing short of perfect service and made sure we had everything we needed without asking for it. His, and the somalier's, recommendations made for a truly esquisite experience. Highly recommended.

Lots and lots of people at happy hour this particular night, which is located in the lobby. There was construction going on so maybe that's why they were all congregated in the lobby. The room was nice. It was a large room and bathroom. The eminities were nice in the bathroom. A service staff member brought bottled water to our room. The pillows and bed were to die for. So comfortable and makes for good sleeping. They have a magnifying mirror in the bathroom that is great! We went down to the pool and it was awesome. They have a slide for the kids that is amazing.

I expected consistent, superior service and I didn't see it. The major complaint was when I was unexpectedly billed for bellman services that I didn't use and the comment was \"let me explain why we have this charge\". But, there were other areas where I saw a lack of attention to detail: a) Definitely the mosquitoes. I would expect that most visitors would not expect mosquitoes in the desert. Despite that, the hotel manager response was something along the lines of \"the property ground ponds are breeding areas for the mosquitoes\". On top of this, when there is a late afternoon/early evening lawn event, you'd think the hotel would have the forethought to provide repellent (esp if mosquitofish cannot survive the desert heat). b) In the spa, I asked the attendant if there were any hair bands. The response was that they were out. How is it that a spa at a Biltmore property could be out of hair bands? c) The ability to hear one another within the conference room was dreadful due to the air conditioner drone. d) Broadband access from within the room. The tech support person was efficient and knowledgeable. I liked that the resort fee covered the broadband access. But, you have got to be kidding that the only two outlets by the desk are both in use (thus, I unplugged the wrong appliance which resulted in the phone call to the tech support person).

Everywhere I looked were signs of delayed maintenance. The overall look of the hotel is of an institutional compound with cement grey walls. There was nothing beautiful about it. The carpets were dirty, the landscaping in poor condition, the swimming pools were murky and cloudy, the pool side furniture faded, worn out, rusting. It was sad walking through the grounds and seeing areas where children are supposed to play ping pong, or on playgrounds, but there was overflowing garbage cans right there ruining any nice effect. At the spa, the showers had mildew growing in them, the towels were worn out and faded, and it had an overall cheap quality about it...not luxurious in the least. Parking is very poorly designed. There is only one self-parking lot at one end of the huge complex, and to get to my room I had to drag my luggage through back alley ways full of garbage and junk.

I chose to go here mostly because of reputation, so I ignored other people's bad experience. There is no way this place is even close to a 5-star property!! Let's start at the beginning- 1- I spent extra money to book a room with a mountain or garden view, & was to be credited $50/day towards food/booze. I was really looking forward to eating at Wright's, and relaxing at the swim-up bar 2- We checked in, and were told valet parking is $21/day, or we can self-park for $7. We chose self-parking, and I wouldn't have minded paying the $7 if the parking was right near my room- it was not. It was a few blocks away, which is a good hike in this heat. 3- We checked in around 7:30 pm, and the first room they gave us had no windows, no view, no patio and the A/C didn't work. They moved us to a similar room that at least had a sliding glass door and working A/C, but still no \"garden\" or mountain view- I had a view of the back of some shrubs. (By the way, we stayed in the \"cottages\"- my husband said it felt more like a cave). 4- The carpet was stained, some of the tiles in the bathroom were broken and cracked. The bed was obviously too hard because they put a pillow-top on it, which kept sliding off the side of the bed, with me on it. I had a terrible night's sleep, and the TV doesn't even have HBO! 5- The pools- this was probably the worst part of our stay. The pools were filthy- I mean, really nasty. The water was green and cloudy and greasy-looking. It was so hot I went in anyway. As I was swimming I pulled my hand out of the water, and there were long black hairs wrapped around it (NOT MINE!!) 6- The service at the pool bar was rude. My husband ordered a Michelob Ultra, and the girl who took his order disappeared for about 4-5 minutes, then came back and said\" Umm, we are out of a lot of things. They have Michelob Ultra at the bar inside. I suppose I could go get one for you if you really want me to.\" What kind of 5-star service is this??? For the $6 they charge for a beer, did she want ME to go get it myself?? 7- Went to make reservations for dinner at Wright's and found out it was closed for renovations. Of course, this is not posted on their website, and I was not informed of this when I checked in. I could go on and on, and I will tell everyone I know to NEVER stay here.

When our requested room (a king smoking) was not available, we were offered a double smoking with apatio. We were happy to take the upgrade but if we had paid for this we would have been VERY dissapointed. For one there was no privacy as you can walk from balcony to balcony. Also, our corner balcony was totally covered by trees and there was absolutely no view from it. The inconsistencies countinued into the quality of the property too. Though the main pool area was clean, it was WAY too crowded. The 2nd largest pool area was a much better choice and it offered a child pool and an adult pool in apeaceful setting. When we ventured out too see the smaller pools, we came across some slimey pools without any towels. They were NOT worth the search. The biggest rip off was the food.

The problems started with the maid service after having no cream for my coffee on our first morning I wrote a note with tip for the maid to leave cream. I received only two packages of cream. The whole week I was without shampoo and Toilet paper at times and forever out of cream for my coffee. Nothing was being restocked in my room. The mantence department was called every day water coming from dishwasher to toilet over flow. The Spa employees are inexsperienced I had the worst massage ever.They made a big deal about my teenagers having a massage without me in the room even though they had on bathing suit's which ruined my daughter b-day since she chosed not to have a spa day.( We have booked her into a kids spa at our local resort back home.)My teenagers where with me when I booked the spa day their is no mistake they are under 18 no one told us the parent present rule nor 24 hour cancilation. I would have had to spend all day in the spa with my kids. My kids would be the first one from the room if some one started touching them threw there bathing suits they have had massages since they were 9 yrs old at kids spa in resorts all over the world. The next was the room service, 22% service charge means you get a tray put on the table and the waiter leaves for you to set up. No glass or ice for the soda's and the pizza where always under cooked. The food was terrible the Wright dining room was closed so we went to the Grill. the food was like it was reheated and dried out and small portions. The service at the pool was hit or miss. Twice they plain forgot to place our order just like the Cafe we ate at once. I called the manager twice and no responce my husband called from our home and got right threw. The manager called me and offered a free night I declined I just wanted to leave. He offered a VIP treatment where someone comes after the maid to make sure you have everything you need like shampoo or TP. I asked why do I have to join a travel club to get special treatment. I'm not asking for special treatment just what I paid for. The staff needs to learn to great people and work on service.

The less expensive Biltmore Grill provided us with better meals and very nice wait staff although eating outside involved shooing away the scavenging birds. The spa was very expensive and treatment was nothing special although the staff was exceptionally pleasant.

We headed to the Paradise Pool, there are eight pools on the property, as well as hot tubs. Knowing the history of the hotel I had visions of Old Hollywood Glamour. Unfortunately the Paradise Pool was more like Spring Break, very crowded, loud rock music playing and a bunch of TVs playing in the private cabanas that open up to the pool area. There is a bar a water slide. We hit the water slide and then headed over to the more serene Catlina Pool, that provided more of what I had expected. For dinner we checked in with the Concierge to ask about Southwest food in the area. HIs response was almost robotic and the directions to the restaraunt were already printed out on cards. We felt that the Hotel was probably getting kickbacks from the place so we asked the Valet guys instead and they were able to recommend some local, authentic places. The Valet guys were helpfull and friendly, I recommend talking to them.

We were prepared for the extra charges and all billing was correct. The hotel is an architectural delight - the grounds lovely - most of the staff are more than pleasant. I took the gratis architectural tour of the hotel and grounds and it was extremely well done, done by Nathan, the lead concierge and 13 year employee . ( I tipped him $10, but he did not have his hand out...) The front desk clerk felt a bit defensive when we registered, but calmed down when I was reasonable about room questions. Apparently many of the rooms are so different in size, ammendities, that it is probably a real set up for confusion/disappointment. It is also a very large hotel,( like sister property, Grand Waliea) so must need to have conventions to be profitable. We really loved the Wright's restaurant; grill and pool cafes were also good. Our maid did a great job, so I hope she got the extra we were charged each day.( I left more...) Attention to detail: our heat wasn't functioning and it was dealt with very quickly by two pleasant fellows. We were given a late check out at 2pm with no extra charges. They let us park our rented motorcycle in the valet lot. ( self parking is a a pain, as mentioned earlier by others) The carpeting in the room had a few spots, but it took me two days to notice...sheets, towels, robes were excellent and i loved the desert flower shampoo etc. Occasionally there was uncaring, lackluster service, but it was the exception, not the rule. (Phoenix has really low unemployment.)The pool outside our windown was pretty noisy one day with high energy team building stuff....so was glad I was not napping! Concierge staff were great - helping us get to the wonderous Barrio Cafe, Le Grande Orange Grocery, and Desert Botanical Garden.

On this trip, my husband and I stayed in room 3115 from December 23 - 25, 2005. This was termed a \"Premier\" room and we had a special promotional rate of $299/night. We arrived at the Biltmore around 12:30pm, well before check-in time, to find our room ready and waiting. We were in the Valley Wing (built in 1979) which was immediately adjacent to the original, main building. Our room had a private porch area with 2 chairs, a table and a chaise longue. A hedgerow seperated us from the pool area (a lovely, smaller pool with Catalina tile, a fountain and a hot tub, more private than the large, main pool). The decor of the room was Craftsman in feel with some desert-color touches and leather and wood touches. Handsome, and plenty of storage for hanging and folded clothes. The King bed was very comfortable and the linens were soft. Bathroom products were present and accounted for, although nothing spectacular. The Biltmore Spa shampoo they provide smells great, though! The shower pressure was very strong and there is plenty of shelf space in the shower/bath to place razors, shave cream, toothpaste, etc., upon. Throughout our stay, the fireplaces were blazing in the public areas (even though it was sunny and 80 during the day, at night it got very chilly) and the holiday decorations were everywhere. This certainly added to the aesthetic charm of the place. We spent plenty of time by the very busy main pool. We enjoyed lunch on two ocassions at the poolside Cabana Cafe (thumbs up to the roasted peach and marinated shrimp salad and the spicy bloody Marys!) which, for two people, was in the $40 range. Waiters took care of bringing us pitchers of lemoned ice water and fresh towels...they were young guys, mostly, and not exactly heel-clicking perfect but sincere, efficient and friendly. Room service breakfast on Christmas morning was delivered at the stroke of the time we'd requested and was exactly as ordered (amazing how many places screw up scrambled egg WHITES and deliver the whole egg -- not the Biltmore, though!). We did not experience any of the \"hidden fees\" that some have complained of here -- everything was very clearly laid out on the forms at check-in and being very frequent travelers we are almost (almost...) used to the service/delivery/etc. fees that are tacked onto room service meals. We did not feel the prices for anything were out of line -- it costs $3 for a small bottle of club soda in the mini-bar and while it's no fun to pay that much, we've both stayed places where that price is easily doubled. The only complaint we had (if you can even call it that) is that this is the third Christmas visit we've made in 4 years and it would have been powerful to have heard a \"welcome back\" or even to have received a letter in the Fall asking if we planned to return. Although the resort is 75 years old and thus in some places shows cracks and crumbles (it's almost entirely made of formed concrete tiles, so no surprise there), at all times we both felt like we were in an incredibly special and unique place -- almost enchanted, with the ghosts of the famous people who preceded our stay all around us. The architecture, the friendly service, the happy families and couples as fellow guests, the sense that there was no other place on earth but \"here\"...all conspired to create a truly memorable holiday weekend for us. I can certainly say that we will return and hope to make a tradition of spending all our Christmases at this enchanted place.", "Date": "December 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExtra costs and things not included\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4232275", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights, upon check in (after struggling to find anywhere that guides you where to park for registration, and eventually turning our keys over to valet to let them move it from where we temporarily parked), when we checked in we asked where to park and were told (in addition to room cost) valet is $21/night or onsite parking is $7/night IF you can find a spot, which our 2nd night we couldn't find a single spot in their small parking area (about 100 spots for about 800 rooms, you do the math) and ended up parking in the parking garage which is about a 10 minute walk from the room. Our room was in the Garden Villa and was a decent room. I wanted ice and read that ice could be delivered to our room (with service charge and tip no doubt). Before going to sleep my husband looked around for a coffee maker (is it just me or is a coffee maker pretty much standard in all hotel rooms these days?), he couldn't find one so he called the front desk and was told \"do you know how expensive those are sir? We can't supply them in all our rooms\", they'd bring one to us for $12.00 service charge or we could order a pot room service in the morning for $12.00 + fees. So in the morning he went to the lobby to buy a coffee, Starbucks everywhere else would be $3.80 but here it was nearly $6.00 for one single cup. For the mark up I think they could afford coffee makers in the rooms. But oh well. The rooms were decent but no noise control at all and since we were near the main courtyard/fountain the people from the Holiday parties were filtering into the area at all hours of the night and it sounded like they were in the room with us. We could also hear people who were lost as the grounds were very confusing and very dark at night. On the morning of our check out we were presented with a bill that included a $150+ greens fee charge (we didn't golf!) and a charge from the mini bar, which we didn't use. This was cleared up and removed by the front desk, but still if we hand't checked it just would have gone our our credit card unnoticed. My review on the Biltmore is mixed, I'm glad we stayed there however I am 100% sure we won't return.

If you stay in the resort you will have to pay alot for bottled water from the gift shop and if you want fresh fruit be prepared to pay $7 for a fruit plate or $28 for a fruit basket. If your family members or friends wish to contact you by phone there is no toll-free phone number to the Biltmore. They must dial directly. Also the hotel charges a daily grounds fee and they are also charging a housekeeping fee of $3/day in addition! I can understand a grounds fee as that includes maintenance of the grounds and the pool area, but to be charged a housekeeping fee on top of this is too much. If we wish to leave a tip for the housekeepers that should be our choice. As for the staff they are mostly pleasant except we heard complaints from our relatives who called that the receptionists sounded bored and bothered when having to transfer them to our room.

The weather was lousy during this visit - 50 degrees and raining for four straight days - but the resort is comfortable enough so that you don't feel trapped in your room. They also run a shuttle to the Biltmore Fashion Park right outside of the hotel. Be warned that the shopping area is outdoors. The room was large and comfortable and nicely decorated. The bathroom had a double sink. The room may seem dated if you are not a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright, but the decor is appropriate to the theme. The pool area is great.

I ate the cafe for lunch a couple of times and was able to order items that were not on the menu. Overall, I loved the resort and would definitely stay there again. A couple of minor negatives that I will mention. I thought that the spa area was small for a resort of that size. The locker room was small and the indoor whirlpool, sauna, and steam room all seemed cramped in too small of a space. Also, the resort will tack on several charges to your daily rate.

Moreover, she took an attitude with me. I called the manager from my room and commented on how the hotel of such caliber shouldn't have employees such as Alexa- especially at the front desk. The manager attempted to avert my attention by asking me about the room, but her response overall, was unsatisfactory. I thought that surely my encounter at the front desk was an anomaly, but realized later that the unacceptable to mediocre service dominated the hotel. The bartender at the swim-up bar located by the slides is probably the only one who should be working there.", "Date": "November 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "bay area, CA", "Title": "\u201cMixed bag all around\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2814196", "Content": "We were lucky to get a good rate, because if we had payed the full price we would hve been very irritated. the main building is nice, and the food and pool were really wonderfull....esp the pool being open really late...I loved night swims! I did not have any spa treatments, so can't comment. OK, now for the bad part...the room was in one of the outer wings, and looked like it had not been redone since the 70's...saggy bed, orange carpet, etc. Maybe the rooms in the main lodge were nicer, but I don't know. Also, very spawled out and confusing to find your way to your room at night. Lots of lizards (not in room!). Kind of a strage place.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix, az", "Title": "\u201cgreat spa!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2427304", "Content": "A friend and I booked a room for one evening. We both found the resort to be lovely. The grounds were amazing and the architecture stunning. Spa treatments were 1/2 off, it made a luxory a reality. I had services with Monique and she was wonderfull. I would say best brow wax in the valley. Overall I enjoyed myself, the only downside was the concierge was a bit uninformed.
