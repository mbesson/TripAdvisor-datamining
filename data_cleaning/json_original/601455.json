The bed was very comfortable, two types of pillows, thick soft bath towels and, best of all, everything was VERY clean.

The property is very new, having opened in early 2006. The facility is very clean and bright, and the morning complimentary breakfast is quite nice. The management is trying to maintain the property, as evidenced by carpet-cleaning crews who were there for several days during this period of time. There was a note to that effect in our suite. Our issue was with the logistics of the carpet-cleaning rotation. The facility was no more than 50% occupied, and we were only there for one night. When we came back to our suite from the festival late Saturday night, all quite tired, we found that the carpeting in our suite had been cleaned (it looked very nice), and was still a bit wet. When we brought this to the attention of the duty desk clerk, he was not extremely interested nor helpful (\"I'm not the one who checked you in\"). We left a comment card for the general manager, and within several days heard back from both him and his administrative assistant, apologizing for the inconvenience (admittedly minor).

BREAKFAST: The hotel offers a fresh breakfast buffet each morning (7-10 am weekends) with juice/coffee/milk, cereal, bagels/bread, fruit, bacon/sausage, egg patties (not recommended) and make-it-yourself waffles. One morning, we ran a little late to the buffet and the staff brought us items that they had already put away - with a smile.
