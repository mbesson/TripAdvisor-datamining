They hadnt made any other arrangements for us, I guess they hoped we were no-shows. Whatever, they finally found us a room at the President which is also Best Western but nowhere near as highly rated as the Universo. Helpful staff but things in the President dont seem to work too well. In the morning we transferred back to the Universo to a room which I cannot fault. Good space, stylish furniture, excellent bathroom, clean and well maintained. There wasnt any coffee facility in the room but it arrive instantly when requested. The staff at the Universo are also helpful although I would avoid heading down for breakfast much after ten if you want to avoid ferocious looks. The breakfast is entirely self-service, even the coffee, and is good for continental, but not quite as good as others have suggested. The hotel location is outstandingly convenient, really close to Termini and the streets are well lit and appear safe at night. You can get the metro or buses from Termini, the 40 is a great bus across the city and very frequent, and if you get on at Termini you can get a seat (not much chance anywhere else). The hotel is very high occupancy with plenty of Far Eastern tour parties in - like most of Rome hotels I guess. We had no problem with noise whatsoever. We didnt eat in the restaurant as we like to try non-hotel food. The Tavinoletta is probably the best of the ones within a block. We also would rate the Fontana de Venere in town (near Trevi). The hotel staff are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. We had done most of our bookings for Vatican, Colosseum online to avoid queues - the Colosseum prebooking saves MASSES of time (so does a Roma pass when you get there) - the Vatican less so. The only other tip I would pass on is that the Opera is just round the corner and would make a special and special night out but you have to book in advance - it was sold out when we tried to book in person.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, clean and amazing breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "ElSteveLumo", "ReviewID": "UR127272947", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel on our Euro Trip, we had a great experience.

The hotel was ready for us promptly at check-in time. We'd booked six months in advance and requested a room with a balcony, and that is precisely what we were checked in to. I was worried about the condition of the hotel after reading some of the earlier reviews, but my worries were groundless. The room itself (room 723) was small, as other posters have indicated. It was a square about 18x18 feet with a small, attached bathroom. There was no \"in-room\" safe, but there were instructions that we could ask for a laptop safety box from the front desk. We did not get one, but experienced no issues leaving our laptop and other electronic devices out in plain site during the day. The hotel seems to be going for a contemporary feel, so there were no drawers at all in the room. Our nightstands were a glass shelf on either side of the bed. The desk was another glass shelf on the other side of the room. There was one armoire-styled closet with shelves. From other poster's pictures, I expected a bidet, but it's actually a low sink alongside of the toilet. The showers did not leak as I'd read previously. However, the showerhead points towards the glass door, so your choice is either to close the door behind you before turning on the shower (and thus enduring the initial blast of cold water for two seconds) or lean in and turn it on first, which gets the floor wet. LOL! Something I really liked about the bathroom was the towel warmers - a metal rack on the wall attached to the hot water pipes, which housekeeping hangs your clean towels on. That was a nice touch. Breakfast everyday consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, small sausages, a range of fresh fruits (peaches, kiwi, prunes, etc.) croissants, cereals. I enjoyed it, although if you're going to stay here for any length of time, you'll eventually get tired of it. I was full everyday. We would usually go down for breakfast around 7:30 or 8 in the morning and all was wonderful. One day we woke up early because of a reservation we had and went down at 6:30. The hot foods (eggs, meats, etc.) were not yet out. But, the coffee, fruits, and breads were available. I got the impression that it was normal to not put the hot foods out until about 7 am. The hotel is within easy, easy walking distance to Termini. Walk one street to the right, then two streets to the left and you're there. Yes, you CAN walk to the historic sites, and we DID, but it was a serious hike. We purchased a week-long metro pass, and took the subway to and from everywhere. The metro shows up every 2 minutes, and it saved us a TON of energy for walking around the sites. It was very fast and convenient. Riding the subway allowed us to really feel like Romans and less like a tourist. Overall, I would say the hotel gave us a good value for our money. We got the early-bird online special, so the price was right. The location was good (north-west side of Termini) and we never felt uncomfortable, even when returning to the hotel late at night - 10 pm or so. If you're staying in Rome for any length of time, I would recommend the location, but I would probably prefer to stay in a less \"contemporary\" styled hotel. Also, if you're only in Rome for a couple of days, you may want to stay closer to the historic sites as opposed to walking or riding the subway. Again, it didn't take a lot of time, and I really enjoyed it - but if you have LIMITED time, you'll want to stay closer to the historic center.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hertzlia israel", "Title": "\u201cgood value for money\u201d", "Author": "liranmalka", "ReviewID": "UR126620653", "Content": "we just returned from a 3 day's stay at the universo hotel, we found it to be good value for money,breakfast was only nice- no vegetables.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwould definately return\u201d", "Author": "Margaret M", "ReviewID": "UR126477483", "Content": "having just returned from a weeks stay at the universo hotel,i found it to be good value for money,on our arrival we did not have the room we booked and were disappointed,when we brought this to the hotels attention our room was changed the next day which we were more than happy with,breakfast was also very good with lots to choose from,don't understand the negative comments regarding breakfast on some reviews.i would definately return to this hotel.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Jasonalison", "ReviewID": "UR125710587", "Content": "My husband and I booked this hotel and were a bit worried then when we read some reviews!!!!

Overall the hotel was pleasant, well decorated, and clean. The location was very convenient to the Termni, however we felt that it was in a touristy part of town. It should be noted, and I am not sure why no one else has posted it, but it is an AFFILIATE of Best Western (meaning, that it carries the Best Western sign and trademark but it is owned by a private owner (possibly of another local hotel operator, there are R's for the brand name), however it is not the typical Best Western that we as American's are used too). There are bellmen and it is a bit more ritzy. I only rated it average because: If you are expecting a soft bed, this place is not for you. Our mattress was rock-hard! we also had a rock hard mattress at a different local hotel in Paris so we are not sure if this is the standard for Europe. My husband and I are used to a somewhat softer mattress (we have a pillowtop at home). The other BW that we have stayed at in the U.S. have softer mattresses. Also we arrived around 12:30-1:00 pm, when we got there the lady at the front desk said that our room would not be ready until 2:00 pm, however my husband was hinting to them that he really would like to take a shower after traveling all day so finally they said we could check in at 1:30, after reading some reviews some were let in earlier than others, our theory was that we had 1 large piece of luggage with 2 carry-on rollers and we felt they just wanted to use it as an excuse so that they bellman could carry our luggage up later when the room was \"ready\" so that we would be forced to pay him a tip. The free continental breakfast is horrible (possibly that is why it is free, there is no way we would ever pay for the food). The reason why I say it is not good is the eggs and cold meat slices are really salty, the croissants were rock hard, and the orange juice was not tasty. When you first initially see the buffet as you walk in it appears there is alot of food, however after you start tasting it, you realize that there is not a lot of \"good\" food to eat. On the second day we ate breakfast (unfortunately we were leaving and were short on time that is why we were forced to either eat the free continental breakfast or no breakfast so we had some cereal (yes the cereal was somewhat decent) we were the first ones there and there were 20-30 gnats/ small fruit flies in and around the orange juice machine, got a glass and it had about 5 dead gnats floating, which tells me either the machine was not cleaned the day prior or it was not cleaned/inspected that very morning before the buffet opened.

First, the front desk refused to give us 2 key cards to our room. They said it was a security issue. This caused us some problems in coordinating our coming and going separately. Understand that the key card must be inserted into a slot inside the room to activate the electricity and air conditioner. If my wife wanted to take a nap (with the air on), she needed to keep the card in the room. This precluded me from going out and returning without waking her to let me in. The second problem was with the configuration of the first room they placed us in. It was a 2 level set-up with the bed and TV on the upper level and the bathroom on the lower lever. Being among the \"older\" crowd, we need to use the bathroom during the night. This means walking down the somewhat narrow stairs while partially asleep. 2 other couples in our group also were given these \"superior\" rooms and had the same complaints. One of them also said that the lower level had no furniture. We were able to change to a more standard room the second night.

An hour and a half later we returned to the hotel to be told that our room was still not ready, could we wait another45 minutes. We went for a wander and returned in an hour, only to be told that we would have to wait another 45 minutes.

The next morning ,the restaurant staff was extremely unorganized and the buffet was not replenished anywhere near often enough. We had to pay for our breakfast in our package, but 3 mornings we had to leave the Hotel and go elsewhere for breakfast as we could not find seating at the hotel restaurant. Thank goodness Rome has a lot to offer as far as sightseeing goes. It enabled us to not have to spend too much time at this hotel. We travelled through Malta, Spain, Sicily, and Italy for many months and the only hotel that we stayed at that we ALL disliked was The Universo. The staff at this hotel seem miserable. They are neither welcoming nor accomodating. We often sat in the foyer and watched other guests complain to the front desk about one thing or another. It was embarassing to watch how unprofessional the front desk was in dealing with these guests.

The ride from FCO airport is about 30 mins to the hotel Our hotel room was clean and of average size for European hotel rooms. Very little closet/stoarge space. No dresser drawers, but the closet/storage unit was roomy enough for both my husband and my clothes. The bathroom was roomy. The room was clean. There was a glass-door to the outside but the view was to the interior of the building wings and just looked out on the a/c unit. The air conditioning was not really working well - we would've preferred it to be a bit cooler, so I was glad we were there in late Sept. There is high-speed internet in the rooms and I think it was free. There is wifi in the lobby area, but they need to give you an access code and its good for 1 hour daily. I didn't bother to get more than 1 a day so I don't know if thats an option. The hotel has a restaurant, but I never saw it opened for dinner - only for breakfast, which had a good variety of breakfast items; cereals, fruits, juices, eggs, meats, breads, coffees etc. There is a small fitness center. I did use it and the machines worked well. The hotel is about 1/2 a block from the Opera House and about 5 mins to Termini Terminal and about 5 mins to Via Nacional - which is a great main street. Only once did we venture over to Termini Terminal and we felt a bit uncomfortable with some of the people hanging around there - they were clearly not \"travelers\". Other than that we felt very comfortable in the streets of Rome and we walked everywhere. The only time we needed to take a taxi was to go to the Vatican museums because it was on the other side of town and we knew it would be a long day. I guess you could walk there. There are lots of restaurants/cafe & food shops within an easy walk. I would recommend the rooftop restaurant at the Hotel Bernini Bristol. It's right by Triton Fountain. It's pricy, but the food was excellent and the view from the restaurant is beautiful. We ate there twice and on our 2nd time dining there, there was a small wedding party celebrating up on the terrace with us. The restaurant terrace is covered so even lunch would be very nice. AND seems to me that the indoor restaurants/terrace are non-smoking - I don't know about the sidewalk cafes. But we didn't see any smoking indoors or even saw ashtrays.

The purse was left in our hotel room while we were at breakfast and only hotel employees had access to the room at the time as later verified by hotel electronic records. The manager refused to assist or believe us and initially discouraged us from reporting the incident to police before finally giving us the police station information. We later spoke with the hotel president, Mr. Fabrizio Roscioli, that evening. He told us to obtain a police report and that we would be reimbursed for our loss through the hotel's insurance coverage, but to date, although we provided our e-mail, phone number, and mailing address, to the hotel, we have not heard anything. This is a common scam in Rome - while we were at the police station a Japanese lady there had $2000 euros taken from her luggage at her hotel.

I had to smile at the review below about being asked, during check-in, if we wanted to book a taxi to take us back to the airport at the end of our stay. This did surprise us at the time, especially the fact that when we said no the response was one of astonishment that we didn't want to pay 30 Euros for a taxi. Why would we when the 4 Euro airport shuttle from Termini is only a couple of minutes walk away? I think maybe the staff are on commission with a taxi firm because on another occassion I asked a staff member if he knew what number bus I needed to take to get to a well known landmark and he recommended that I take a taxi - in the end I found the bus by myself quite easily. Apart from the hard sell on taxi services I was very happy with the staff and found them to be friendly. Our room was average sized, but nicely decorated and very clean and quiet. The bathroom was large with a great power shower. Best of all was the air con - I'd been warned that Rome is sweltering in July, but I hadn't appreciated how draining the heat was going to be. To be able to come back to a cool room after a day of melting outside was just bliss. Mini bar and bar prices were very reasonable. Breakfast was good with a varied choice of the usual buffet selection of pastries, cereals, breads, fruit, yoghurt, bacon, eggs and sausages. We had no problems with getting a table straight away even though we were going down for breakfast at about 08:30, a time we normally find to be quite busy at other hotels. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a clean and comfortable base that is very easy to find when you arrive in a strange city and one that is very convenient for the underground station, tram and bus stops. It is also reasonably easy to walk from the hotel to most of the major sights, though probably a lot easier during cooler months. It would probably take about 20 minutes to walk to Trevi Fountain if you didn't need to keep stopping for a rest and a drink on the way. For younger travellers who like a loud and lively nightlife I would probably not recommend the Universo - somewhere nearer to Castel St Angelo or the island in the Tiber might be be a better base.

We arrived at the Universo Hotel at around 1.30pm, and check in is at 2pm. As we were early the staff basically did not want to deal with us and almost demanded that we 'go and have lunch' and come back at check-in time. However it was fasinating to see that a couple off the street who were paying cash received a room straight away, and pre-paid customers (over the internet) are sent away. Once we were able to check-in we were served by Ann Marie F. who did not want to provide any assistance whatsoever, in regard to questions about the area, tours etc, I was once again sent away. This was general service at the hotel no matter who you spoke to, they just don't want to deal with any customer enquiries, especially if you speak english. The buffet breakfast is awful. The room is very average and everyday when we came back to room it never looked like it had been cleaned properly, the beds were made, but there would always be stuff left on the floor and the bedside table was never wiped down. Tea and coffee making facilities are not in the room, but they are available on request. However housekeeping never replaced any tea/coffee and did not clean the cups! So we took it upon ourselves to swap them at breakfast, rather than have to talk to the staff. On top of all of this, this hotel advertises they have air conditioning. There is NO AIR CONDITIONING! This hotel only provides air conditioning at certain times of the year (this is apparently due to Italian law), however they really should be upfront with their customers and make them aware of this, before they book.

The hotel was a five minute walk from the busy Terminii metro/rail/bus station.We had one of the en-suite bedrooms on the 7th floor-you get a nice balcony to sit out on, although the view of the opposite hotel roofs isnt much to look at, you do get the sound and feel of Rome. The room was compact, however it had wireless internet, satellite tv (only three english channels-CNN,Sky and BBC News) pay-tv and a well stocked-very cheap minibar-alcohol is just two euros! Room service is free, and reasonably priced too. The bed was a king sized double, the en-suite has a shower-no bath and is very stylish. Overall a very clean room, if a bit small-but then you aren't going to be in your room other to sleep and rest, and most of the hotels in Rome are similarly sized it seems. It was not a problem. We did not require the air con, since it was around 20C during the day, and 10C at night-we found we could sleep with the balcony door open-it just beecomes noisy around 7am when Rome's famous traffic gets busy! The staff were very polite, courteous and helpful, they spoke excellent english-although i prefer to speak Italian in Italy and it is always well-received by the natives, your pronunciation may make them smile but they are grateful if you make the effort. This is primarily a business-minded hotel, it is in a very business-dominated area. Having said that, the hotel breakfast caters very well for all styles, american, continental european or a full english breakfast, it is excellent value. They have a lunch menu, you need to pre-book this or they cannot serve you on an impromptu visit. We dined in the evening restaurant-it was totally empty! The food was excellent, and reasonably priced considering Rome's restaurants are famously expensive! I recommend the 'set' menu. It seemed the hotel do not advertise their menu to anyone outside the hotel, which is a shame. The cocktail bar was busier!! Overall, an excellent stay and very good value for money-it was technically the 'low' season and there are good deals to be had. The hotel arranged our airport transfer too, a very smart Mercedes limousine, a friendly driver called Adriano, smartly dressed and very professional-45 euros for the service, a flat rate regardless of passengers and baggage. Fiumicino is around 30km away but it is driveable in around 30 minutes. You could take the cheaper 'leonardo Express' train from the Terminii but it means more hassle lugging your baggage around on a busy station. Rome itslef is wonderful, you need a 3 night stay to soak up the sights, all the Roman ruins etc are within walking distance...from the hotel walk to Piazza della Repubblica, take Via Nazionale and you will see the main tourist sights...the Colosseum is nearby, or two stops from the Terminii by metro. I recommend paying 19 euros, obtaining a city sightseeing tourbus-the ticket is hop-on/off, lasts for 48 hrs. well worth it for seeing the whole city and the Vatican too, or your feet will get very tired!! There is so much to see. Avoid at all costs the tourist areas if you get hungry, they will rip you off pricewise. Be cautious, hunt down the side streets, ask the locals and you will find many gems where to eat, and save your cash too. Use trattorias, pizzerias if you like a starter, pasta/pizza and a desert. Wine is much cheaper than beer, plus the bottles are bigger too! At the Vatican City, avoid the so-called 'tour-guides', touting for business. The queues to get into the St Peters Basilica can be around a 30 min wait, but it is FREE to get in. The touts charge 25 euros each and take you to the gate. Not worth it at all. Once in, take the Cupola tour-you will need to be fit and not claustrophobic! You can climb 550 steps to the top of the Dome-the 360 degree view is awesome at 450 ft above St Peter's!!...you can pay for a lift, but you still climb 220 steps on anarrow spiral staircase-it can make you hot, dizzy and light-headed.

There are some positive things, but also some really annoying things about this hotel. The negative points are: 1. The hotel is near a very central avenue, so sometimes it got a little difficult sleeping at night with all that noise. 2. We expected a more decent breakfast from a so-called 4-star hotel. The forks and knives were inside a cloth, which had turned into black from non-washing. The coffee machine was not working and the bread was not covered and had small flies moving around. But the most extreme thing I saw was that the man who was in charge of filling the food, every now and then took the used paper clothes from the empty tables, in order to clean the coffee machine and the juice machine!!! And when I say the used ones, I mean it!!! 3. While checking out, a problem appeared and the machine would not accept the credit card. My husband and I thought that maybe the amount was too big for just one card, so we asked the front desk clerk (a 55-year-old-man) to pass the card again, with a smaller amount this time (and the rest of the amount would be paid in cash). Immediately the man turned into red (!!) and started talking about us to his colleague in Italian, obviously disturbed. Then he turned to us and shouted that he cannot pass the card again, very impolite, as if we were beggars or something. We understood that there was no other way, so we asked him if we could use the free wi-fi internet of the lobby so as to transfer the money from a bank account. His answer was that if we wanted internet, we could go across the street to an internet cafe and pay for it!! Thankfully, my husband did not lose his patience, went to an ATM (cash point) and withdrew the amount, we paid them and our suffering finally ended. And now some positive stuff: 1. The hotel is two blocks away from Termini, the station of trains, buses and metro. 2. The room is very small, but nice and clean.

The tour bus companies also have their offices/destination point within a few blocks.

It was large as was the bathroom - but the decor looked better on their website than in actuality. The beds were comfortable. The flooring treatment was made up of large squares of commerical quality carpet material - and it did not look like professionals installed it. The decor was stylish but not of good quality. The bathroom was royal blue and didn't coordinate with the bedroom scheme. The designers/renovators responsible don't get high marks for good design. Too bad - this hotel has good bones and could look great with better interior design. Check out the hotel next door for good design.

It was quiet with virtually no traffic noise- just the occasional chiming of church bells at night. Accommodation was good. The room was clean and large enough without being a luxury room. The bathroom has modern facilities and a heated towel rack. No bath but we were happy the new glassed shower facilities (no dreaded shower curtains) Requests for an ironing board, extra pillow and tea/coffee making utensils were responded to quickly and pleasantly. A hot breakfast is provided until 10.30am. There is a selection of hot and cold food (though we wished they would vary the menu just a little - this probably doesn't matter if you are only staying a couple of days). The breakfast room was always well laid out and tables were efficiently and politely cleared. The only negatives were a slow check in and one unpleasant female staff member who couldn't manage a smile for weary travellers straight off a long flight. However, other staff members, particularly two of the three male desk staff, were pleasant and helpful. Extending our room and check out were handled well. Service staff were helpful and responsive.

However, run across a few problems during your stay - and the elegant facade breaks apart... The second day of our stay, we had rented one of the movies available on the TV-system. At 10 Euro per movie, you expect things to run smoothly - so when the movie started skipping, pausing and shutting down, we called the Front desk. \"Hi, sorry to bother you, but our TV-system is acting weird.. The movie won't play. Can you take a look at it?\", I gently asked the receptionist over the phone. \"No, sorry\", he answered - and then hung up. Hardly what you can call good service. Furthermore, the entire staff - except for the cleaners perhaps - are arrogant and stuck-up (much like Romans in general) - and generally not keen to help you with anything beside handing you the key to your room. However, when you're working in the service sector, and in an exclusive hotel for foreigners, there's hardly room for being snotty.

The hotel is not located in the greatest area. Being near the Termini station may be considered central, but there are certainly countless better locations elsewhere in Rome. I booked this hotel on points, and I must admit I had some hesitation. Upon arrival, I immediately got a bad impression. The hotel lists itself as a four star hotel. This is ridiculous. The hotel is a tourist class 2 star hotel and nothing more. The lobby is tired and dreary, and the only thing more dreary are the inept, and very surly staff. The rooms aren't too bad if you don't care about lumpy beds. They have been re-done, but.........my room (like the others) had a shower stall with nothing more than a curtain. Naturally, the entire floor would be flooded with each shower. Quite gross when having to step around in it afterwords. I expect more for a hotel listing themself as a four star hotel. The breakfast was also quite unappealing - bacon literally swimming in a bucket of grease. Also be careful if the front desk tries to arrange a taxi for you (e.g. - to go to the airport). The costs are far higher than if you hailed one on your own. This truly is an unpleasant hotel, and since there are over 1100 other choices for hotels in the Eternal City, almost all of these (in my opinion) would be a better choice than the Universo.

The positives included location, price, and cleanliness. Their location was quite close to the main travel hub in Rome (Termini), which allowed us to either walk, take the bus, metro, or trains to whatever sites we pleased. This came in very handy as we could pick whatever mode of transportation suited us best for the time of day or night.

Also, being a part of the Best Western hotel chain ensured a certain standard of cleanliness throughout the hotel. Our room was cleaned promptly and thoroughly each morning. However, the negatives sadly outweighed the positives. First and foremost coming to mind was the help (or lack thereof) from seemingly many of the reception staff members. It seemed that one was either 'greeted' by a grumpy desk woman (who seemed to be at the front desk both night and day...maybe that's why she was always so irritated with everyone?), or well-meaning gentlemen or ladies who unfortunately had large problems communicating in any language except Italian. (This was very disappointing, as it was a fair-sized hotel and most of the guests there seemed to be foreigners such as myself.) Whether getting short answers or answers to questions which were not asked...it seemed a chore trying to get any help from any staff members except for the Breakfast staff (whose English was excellent, and demeanor very cheerful...they should have been the ones working the front desk!). It also did not help that we were told to get ice from the bar downstairs, whose staff members openly rolled their eyes and made comments under their breath when asked politely for help. Also important was that the bed in our room was quite possibly thehardest bed we had ever slept on. This led to a few mornings with stiff backs.

Well, mixed bag this hotel. You cant go wrong with this hotel in terms of location. You are literally 2 mins away from the central train and metro station so excellent for travelling ang getting to all the major sights. You can even walk to the sites in about 15-20 minutes. The room is modern and is nice and clean...I'm fussy with cleaniness..this hotel was fine no problem. However, it rates itself as a 4 star...but not to my standards i'm afraid. The room was comfortable, however: 1. You can hear the upstairs room toilet each time it flushes, which for the first time is shocking, however you get used to it. 2. Rooms aren't very sound proof - the 'crazy maid' that is mentioned in a previous review is still there. She starts doing her thing at about 6am! So you get disturbed whilst sleeping. The street outside is noisy with work going on. You have to sleep with the window shut. 3. You have to ask for tea and coffee making facilities which are complimentary. However, you may find that the maid clears away all the coffee/tea etc from your room leaving only your kettle. So you have to ask for more supplies of these. However, this can be a little annoying. Room service can take a while bringing these up so if your gasping for a cuppa - you'll have to gasp a little longer. I got told off by the waiter as there was already a kettle in the room and the bar sent up another one when I only asked for tea/coffee etc. I did tell them this in the first place. 4. We ordered a diet coke from room service which arrived fairly quickly with the metal bottle top still in tact. We were not given anything to open it with and room service didnt offer to open it before they left the room. So my husband had to open the bottle with his teeth!! 5. The hot breakfast buffet is limited to tiny sausages, very salty bacon and scrambled egg everyday. The rest of breakfast is basic by standard. Judging by breakfast we didnt eat at the resturant in the evening. Room service menu is very limited. These things did spoil our expectations of the hotel but none the less it is a good base if these issues dont bother you. we just got used to it after a couple of days. Location definately compensates. The front desk are helpful and the service they provide is good. They are good at suggesting where to eat and will make a reservation for you promptly without you having to ask. There isn't a safe in the room so you have to use one at reception. It is trustworthy and they do take precautions which was reassuring. They seal your currency in an envelope and make you sign across the seal. We gave them our passports and currenct it was fine on collection. On the subject of passports - they retained ours upon check-in saying they'd return them in 20 mis - dont forget that they have your passport as they will forget to return it in 20 mins so you have to chase. Places to eat: There is a cheap pizzaeria on the same road at the hotel 'Smelda' or something like that (sorry cant remember) but its cheap and cheerful. In the next street there is a better one called Tudini's where food and service are both good. If you go down out the hotel and turn left then left again there is a resturant called 'matriciana' which is a traditional italian with good food. If you turn right there is a resturant build in a tower which the hotel also recommend - however this isn't all that. The best resturants we ate at were : 'bi-bi-qu' modern contemporay resturant with delicious food and ambience. its about 20 min in taxi. But the best traditional italiant we went to was 'Sabatini' in Trastervere - superb food and its prim and proper. well wortht the visit - we'll definately go there again. If you plan to use the metro - its really easy - buy a three days metro ticket unlimited use - for about 11 euros its worth it. You buy these from the newsagents in the termini station. All in all - ok hotel but I wasn't impressed with the service - shame - but you should always go and try it out for yourself.", "Date": "February 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice but overrated\u201d", "Author": "worldaviator", "ReviewID": "UR6700018", "Content": "Location by Rome Termini is great as the hotel is close to the main train station. As for the hotel itself, we found our room and stay to be average at best. We got a nice \"loft\" room, with the beds on the upper part of the loft via stairs, with the bathroom and closets on the lower part of the loft. In all 3 nights, the room stayed very warm and we had to leave the door to the balcony window opened all night just to cool the entire room down! Because of this, we heard all the street noise and loud street people. The bathroom was nice and large but discovered some backup in the shower, probably due to the old pipes / plumbing of the building. Breakfast was not much to write about .... it's there, but don't expect it to be memorable. Due to the large numbers of visitors, the breakfast items felt mass produced: orange juice and coffee via a machine, huge pans of eggs, unhealthy bacon and mini sausage links that looked uninviting. Housekeeping was rushed and we didn't appreciate being buzzed by phone and then being hung up after picking up.

We chose the Termini area as we did not want to trawl around town, or get a taxi looking for a hotel some distance from the station after arriving on the Terravision Bus. We found the hotel friendly and it had a small hotel feel, although it had lots of rooms. I guess that it wasn't busy as we didn't really see many people whilst we were there. We booked a superior room - I am not sure what the difference between a standard and superior room is. However we had lots of room and a massive bathroom with a seperate area for the bidet and toilet. The room was extremely modern, all glass and dark wood. We had internet access (which we didn't use) lots of choice on the inhouse movies and a flat screen TV with Sky News, BBC News and CNN, as well as some Italian stations. The room was quiet apart from the car horns on the street (fact of life in a big city). We were on the 4th floor with a lovely stone balcony, which I imagine would be great in the summer. On our 2nd night we ate dinner in the restaurant which was very good; excellent service and quite reasonable for what we ate and drank! There were some downsides - there was no in room safe, you had to request that the mini bar be stocked (probably a good thing that it wasn't!) and the breakfast was mainly a cold buffet, only a small amount of scrambled egg and small sausage.

Part of our business involves bringing youth soccer players and their families to Italy each summer to play in a tournament. We often stay in Rome with our family as well as my husband is an Italian citizen. July 2006 marked our 4th stay at the Hotel Universo with our group - we were there for 4 days. We use this hotel becasue it is reasonably priced, centrally located and within walking distance to many good restaurants. The hotel had been renovated since our last stay in 2004 and I was really surprised and pleased by the changes. While our triple room was small, with little space to place our clothes, it was fresh and modern, with a nice long desk for me to use my laptop. The room had large plasma type television and fantastic high speed internet connection. The best feature was the ENORMOUS bathroom with gorgeous cobalt blue granite floors, double sink, separate bath and beautifully tiled shower. The shower even had 2 shower heads and was really powerful. Bathroom came equipped with a towel warmer, full length mirror, great toiletries, and was SUPER clean. The breakfast in the large breakfast room offered a huge assortment, as in past years, although I hate those caffe machines. The bar area had also been renovated and although the bartender was a bit sour, the bar was kept well stocked and not overly pricey. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night with our daughters because we were waiting to watch Italy play Germany in the World Cup semifinal in a meeting room that the hotel had kindly set up. The food was okay but the selection was very limited which could have been because the staff wanted to close early to watch the World Cup - for which I could hardly blame them! The only problem we had was the crazy maid service that made it impossible to sleep after 7:00am! I travel several times a year to Italy and elsewhere in Europe as well as the United States and have never, ever experienced being awakened at 6:45 or 7:00am EVERY DAY by maids clearning rooms, including loudly dragging service carts down the halls, making noise opening and closing doors, and vacuuming empty rooms! Maybe guests on other floors did not have this experience but it was no picnic never getting adequate sleep. I thought it was all too ironic that the hotel thoughfully provides a choice of pillows, rare for most hotels, but doesn't allow you to get a good night's rest! I suppose if we went to bed at 10:00pm, getting up at 6:45 would not be a problem, but after all this is Roma, and we are often out until 12:30 or 1:00am. No guests should be awakekend this early - unless you request a wake up call!
