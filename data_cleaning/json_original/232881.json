The room had no view at all from the window and the TV only had 1 English channel (BBC World) but we weren't in Rome to sit looking out of our hotel window or watch TV. The hotel is in a perfect location, 5 mins walk to Trevi Fountain, 25 mins to Colloseum, 15 mins walk to Spanish Steps, 15 mins from the Pantheon, 2 mins walk to underground station (Barberini). Bascially, an excellent base for travellers like us who don't mind walking everywhere round a city. Importantly, the area felt safe and we had no hesitation walking round at night. There is a Spar shop round the corner which is perfect for any refreshments etc although don't expect award winning customer service from the staff. Breakfast is basic, bread, fruit, yogurts, scrambled egg and sausages etc but fine for us and the same standard we have experienced anywhere in Europe.

I booked a single room, sometimes that means a double room with single occupancy. I had noticed a previous comment about the size of the single rooms but nothing could warn me how bad the room size is. On entering the room, I thought I had been booked into a cupboard, the width is less than 6 foot wide and about 10 foot long. This contained a single bed, a small table, a small wardrobe and a mini bar. On opening the shuttered window, I was faced by a wall about three foot away and the only light was from an opening at an angle of 90 degrees, you really had to peer out to see any scenery, it was just like out of Faulty Towers. I would assume that rooms 101, 201, 301 and 401 are all the same so I would avoid these at all costs. There must be single rooms with an outlook as someone has posted that their single room overlooked the street. The hotel and room have undergone a big refurbishment program but no amount of refurbishment can alter the size of a room. It would have been great for a child as it had a connecting door to a twin bedded room which was an acceptable size. It has digital TV, including Sky News. The air conditioning can be noisy but can be switched off overnight. The hand basin does not have a plug or stopper so the water cannot be contained, really odd. The hotel said it was just to wash your face!!!!! The hotel is in a side street where very little traffic traverses, so it is very quite and no noise from traffic or tourists. The breakfast was OK for a continental breakfast, the only hot item was scrambled eggs. The hotel staff were very helpful with providing information, ordering taxi's etc. The entrance area is compact but no real seating area. The old adage of you get what you pay for certainly applies here. For seven night\u2019s bed and breakfast I paid \u00a3405, which \u00a358 per night in the middle of Rome is cheap. The hotel is located within walking distance of the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, the Pantheon and most tourist attractions. The local Barberrini Metro Station will take you to right outside the Colosseum and a short distance to the entrance to Saint Peters. If using a taxi from the railway station, ensure you have the address written down, as Rome taxi drivers do not have the KNOWLEDGE of British taxi drivers and they have never heard of this hotel. Taxi fares are very cheap as is the Metro system. Restaurants are plentiful in the area, as is an English pub the Albert just around the corner and a Spar shop opposite. To sum up, this hotel would be acceptable - 3 stars - provided you do not want a single room. If you want a single room I suggest you look elsewhere.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "monaghan, ireland", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay.\u201d", "Author": "jimger045", "ReviewID": "UR126114173", "Content": "We spent five very pleasant days in Rome in mid-February including four nights in the Hotel Memphis and we were very happy with this choice. Its location is ideal for visiting all the major attractions in the centre of Rome \u2013 walking from the hotel, the Trevi fountain, Pantheon and Piazza Navona are all almost in a line .We walked this route so many times during those few days that it felt almost like home! We took a taxi from the airport, as we met two others who shared , \u2013 otherwise we would have taken the direct train to Termini Station. Must confess that the hotel didn't look terribly impressive when the taxi stopped and we could see it, just up a little cobbled street, but in fact it is a pretty cool little street, leading up to the piazza Barbereni and the Metro station just a few minutes away. The hotel is very modern and our room had everything we needed including a great shower, sat tv., etc. There is no bar or restaurant but in Rome you tend to leave your room early and , except for perhaps a quick visit to freshen up for the evening, return late at night, so maybe a lounge area , while it would be nice, is not much of an issue. The breakfast is excellent, by the way, and gives a great start to the day. Lots of restaurants nearby around the piazza Barbereni and Via Veneto and all the way to the Pantheon \u2013 spoiled for choice! We recommend a trip to Ostia Antica, the ancient port of Rome. Metro to Termini, then to Pyramide and a 20 minute or so train gets you there. In February, we had the place almost to ourselves and we marvelled at walking on paths where its 100,000 residents had trodden 2,000 years ago. Back in the city on another day we entered the Forum via the Palatine hill entrance. Snow still lay where the sun hadn't penetrated and we strolled along the pine strewn hill admiring the Domus Augustus and other ruins, eventually descending into the Forum itself - so magical! Had been there a few years ago and loved it and was not disappointed this time \u2013 how could you be! On another day we visited the Vatican \u2013 a one euro fare from our local metro. Went to the top of the cuppola \u2013 great for photos but quite a climb if, like my wife, you don't like heights!.Skipped the Vatican museum and Popes' tombs as we had seen them on our last trip. Instead we visited Castel Sant' Angelo \u2013 really worth a visit - and had a pleasant light lunch there as we looked across at the Vatican and handfed the almost tame pigeons that flew onto the castle window beside our table. Then we walked along the Tiber to Trastevere \u2013 quite a long walk \u2013 snack there and a visit to the Cathedral of S. Maria in Trastevere. The area is full of beautiful restaurants but it was too early for dinner \u2013 a pity! From there we strolled at leisure back to the hotel, following our map, passing the ruins at Largo di Torre Argentina called Area Sacra. Don't know much about it but the stray city cats sure loved it! Later, on a little street that leads up to the Pantheon, we stopped at a nice leather goods shop to buy gifts for our kids ( grown-up but still looking for presents! ) . Rome is a great city for walking \u2013 and has a surprise around every corner! And so much more to see \u2013 the Appian way, the Baths of Caracalla, the catacombs etc, etc, \u2013 still, we have to leave something for our next visit!

The hotel was very well presented, very modern and trendy inside. The rooms were comfortable; plenty of wardrobe space, air conditioning and comfy beds. The only issue was in the bathroom- the shower was very powerful and did not drain out of the shower tray fast enough.This often caused leaks and the bathroom floor was wet through. The tray would fill up within two minutes so showering became a problem. Breakfast was good- basic but good. I had an issue with the hotel, which I found very frustrating. Prior to arriving at the Memphis Hotel, I emailed them to enquire about the shuttle service that they provide, which will transport you from the airport to the hotel. I was informed that the cost of this journey would be 100 euros. I replied and stated that I did not require this service due to the excessive price. I received a reply stating that this was not a problem. However, when we landed at Ciampino airport the taxi driver from the hotel was waiting for us. I approached the driver to tell him that I did not want the shuttle and would be getting the bus to the hotel, which was four euros. The driver spoke very little English and could not understand us so he phoned the hotel and my partner spoke to the receptionist over the phone. They tried to argue that we had not notified them that we didn't want the shuttle. The receptionist said that she could reduce the price to 50euros.By this point though, we had already purchased bus tickets. I found the taxi driver and hotel receptionship to be very rude and unhelpful! Also, there is a three euro per person, per night city tax that every tourist is expected to pay on check-out from the hotel. We were not informed at point of booking or check-in and were lucky that we had just enough money left at check-out. Overall, a good stay and the hotel is beautiful and is in an amazing location.

The shower is so tiny that if i was so stretch both elbows out I would hit the walls (and I'm petite). - The hot water in the sink takes a good 2-5 minutes to warm up and the shower hot water takes about 2 minutes to heat up. I felt so wasteful turning the tap on to heat up before use. - The hotel walls are very thin. We could hear everything happening on the same floor and outside. When you have spent the whole day walking you value a good night sleep and I kept waking up at night because of all the noise from outside. - The hotel staff was rude, disengaged, and very uninformative (except the waiter in the breakfast room). When I asked for a recommendation of where we should eat lunch the lady at the front replied \"anywhere\"! - The tv/satellite signal kept cutting out on a hot summer day (not a big deal but annoying) Positives: - Great location - close to most attractions - The waiter in the breakfast room was very welcoming and very accommodating Overall, I would never stay at this hotel again and I would never recommend it.

They never bothered standing up even when I approached the desk. As soon as I mentioned the name of the restaurant they looked at each other with this sarcastic look on their faces and started giggling. It was very embarassing to me. When I asked if they had a menu for the restaurant (as they are next to each other maybe they have some agreement with them to send over some guests), the answer of the gentleman was this: \"No, that is a restaurant, this is a hotel.\" I didn't want to give up just yet so I asked them if they could check the menu for me on internet (I don't believe this is a strange request from the staff of a 4-star hotel. ). The answer from the same person was the following: \"No, we don't have computers for other people!\" Well, as for \"other people\", they made me feel like an alien, indeed.... At this point I just thanked them, turned around and started walking out hoping this joke would be over...I was very wrong.

After a while i finally managed to change room to the 4th floor, which was much better. Wasn't really easy though ! i had to explain that I was claustrophobic so they understand the problem ! NO WIFI in the rooms and NOT FREE : 5\u20ac for one hour and 10\u20ac for 3hours Quite expensive when you see that every hotel offers free wifi ! The WIFI is only available in the reception area, and in rooms they give you a ETHERNET cable to use, I had to change mine 4 times and still didn't work.... I was only told at the end of my stay that there were two ETHERNET plugs. So if you are a business traveller who has to work in peace try to find another hotel, unless they change their internet offer/connexion. - Staff is very nice (Danilo and Eleonora) always available and helpfull (I had a lot of problems with the internet in my room during my whole stay, they helped me until the end! Danilo in particular who was offering me coffee while he tried to arrange the problem in the reception). - Breakfast was correct and simple : different types of croissants, fresh slices of bread, little salted \"brioches\", marmelade, fruit, eggs, but orange juice and ananas juice aren't fresh. The people serving tea/coffee are very nice too. Restaurants in the area are only for \"tourists\" where you don't eat very well (considering that Roman cuisine is one of the best in Italy! it's a shame not to taste it), i do not recommend them at all. The hotel will tell you to go to \"Wine and Grill\" - but when I saw the state of the raw fish and meat in the entrance I escaped ! After a 40 min walk one night, I finally found a lovely Roman restaurant very close to Fontana di Trevi : SPIRITI E FORME Vicolo scavolino n\u00b063. They offer a great choice of wine, staff is very professional, I had a very nice \"carpaccio di zucchini con Pesto di rucola e pine e parmeggiano\" + Pici (sort of fresh spaghettis) Cacio e Pepe (typical roman pasta sauce with pecorino cheese and black pepper, delicious!) Not very expensive (10\u20ac for a primo compared to 15-20\u20ac in the tourist restaurants without the same quality).

European hotels are generally nothing compared to hotels in America or the Middle East (unless you are talking about the Ritz), but I have to say that for a European hotel this is the nicest one I have ever stayed in. It has been done up very nicely; the decoration is modern, rooms are spotless, bathroom and shower are amazing, nothing negative I can say about the hotel itself. The only downside to this hotel was the staff. Apart from a young girl who was at reception the first night we arrived and the man serving breakfast, the rest were not at all helpful, and made you feel as if they were discussing you in Italian while you were standing right in front of them. Do not let this put you off however. We found the majority of people in Italy to be extremely rude and arrogant. They all seem to have this 'we don't need you' attitude with tourists. We always made an effort to try and speak Italian to people but as I said, did not seem impressed and acted as if we were causing them an inconvenience just by breathing! So do not let this put you off about this hotel, or any hotel in Rome, for as far I am concerned, most people in Rome are rude. Breakfast was normal for a European hotel. Ham, cheese, salami, croissants, bread, jam, yoghurt, boiled eggs and a few types of cereal. All in all I would recommend this hotel and would most probably go back unless I win the lottery and stay at a 5 star deluxe hotel next time! Rooms are excellent, location is amazing (you cross the road and come to the little alleyways that lead to the Trevi fountain, plus Barberini metro is 2 minutes away), breakfast is normal.

We were a five minute walk, from the Trevis Fountain. The same for the Spanish steps, and about eight minutes to the Pantheon. Ancient Rome was a good stretch of the legs, I would say a good half an hour to forty minutes. Not that you notice because Rome is beautiful. About the same for the Vatican. Also let me add, that next door to the Memphis, is a small family run restaurant which was voted best restaurant in Rome, for 2010. I can highly recommend it, the atmosphere in there was unforgettable.. The breakfast was continental buffet style, with as much coffee and tea you can drink. The Staff were fabulous, friendly, warm, highly efficient. Don't let the previous reviews put you off.
