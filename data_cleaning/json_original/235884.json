Breakfast was quite reasonable but no waiting staff present so impossible to ask for anything you needed. Our main gripe was the lack of hospitality - we arrived in Venice at 9pm and were checked in by the manager. The Hotel has a restaurant and we asked for a table but were told they were now closed. As many diners were still there and the advertised closing time is 9pm we were only minutes too late - I don't think this was a good start to our holiday!

My fiance and I shared a room with a double bed framed by wooden wardrobes and cupboards set into the wall (plenty of storage!), a good-sized bathroom with a shower and, notably, a shiny new-looking TV with Italian Sky, which showed CNN and BBC News amongst other channels. In a priced-up city full of rip-offs, this hotel is good value. You get what you pay for, and you're actually setting up your base in a fantastic area of Venice. Two minutes walk away is the Peggy Guggenheim gallery and the beautiful, enormous Salute church. At the same distance is the vaporetto stop, and it takes less than 5 minutes on the vap. to cross the Grand Canal to St Mark's Square. This is one of the huge advantages of this hotel - you are so close to the best sights of the city, but you are not paying the extortionate prices of St Mark's. One word of warning - do not eat supper at the hotel restaurant. Our experience of it was unpleasant and we would not recommend it. Food in Venice is not, from experience, on a par with that in Rome or Florence, and you will find that the old saying \"I could buy a better pizza at home\" applies here. However, if you're into your seafood you will find plenty of other places to eat out.

It was populated mainly by university age students who were loud and obnoxious. Hence we didn't sleep much and our complaints to the front desk went unnoticed. The first morning there was no hot water for shower or shaving. The front desk said they had plumbing problems and it would be fixed soon. It wasn't fixed till late afternoon. The walls are paper thin and if you are next to the common washroom (we had an ensuite) the door will bang all night.

There were other students from the U.S who were also staying at the hotel but they were well behaved, quiet and considerate. Our end of the building contained the German students who were literally just out to party. Perhaps the hotel management was afraid of losing so much student business that they tolerated the noise and rude and incosiderate guests as there were so few of us 'others'. In any event it was a terrible experience and the old saying that 'cheap is expensive' rang true. We didn't sleep a wink. Room is exceptionally small but we could have over looked this for cleanliness and quiet.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cHorrible, checked out early!\u201d", "Author": "guptaup", "ReviewID": "UR2814363", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here only 1 night b/c we found another hotel to stay at. The room was the smallest we stayed in (even by European standards). We had already stayed in Rome and Florence but this was a surprise to see how small the room was. There was no elevator, and 2 long flights of stairs and hallways to get to our room. The staff was nice though, but I would not recommend this hotel since there are many better ones to choose from.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1686699", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights in Hotel Messner. We had a wonderful room overlooking a garden. It was quiet, modern, very comfortable. The breakfast was great and the staff was friendly. And you can't beat the location! You could practically see the gorgeous white church Santa Maria della Salute from the hotel. Our experience would definitely lead us to return here if we are in Venice again! One tip - the towels were totally inadequate, just pieces of cloth, so you might want to bring your own!", "Date": "March 1, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Messner", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d235884-Reviews-Hotel_Messner-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$90 - $218*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Dorsoduro 216</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Fondamenta Ca' Bal&Atilde;&nbsp;</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30123</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "235884", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/33/ee/33eea23a800caac858f08b024999401f4large.jpg"}}
