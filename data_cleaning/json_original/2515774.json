We have kept up to date with reviews on trip advisor for this property and after staying here have to agree with all the positive comments posted. Getting there from the airport in our hire car was relatively easy, although John Cleese on our satnav did say we had arrived when the place was actually further on and round the corner, so we got a bit lost! My best recommendation is to look out for the big, grey boulder wall which is opposite the Cliffs and seemed to be the only wall like it in Vegas, so was a good landmark. Also watch out for the dangerous road intersection a few yards up from the property (on turning right out of the cliffs) as it just suddenly appears with no stop signs, and as driving etiquette is first come first served, you could easily have an accident- installing roundabouts would be a great idea for America!! Check in was easy, quick and very friendly. You park your car at the front and then are allocated your parking spot which is numbered the same as the unit you are staying in, so you always get the same spot which is very useful. The grounds are well kept with flower gardens, bushes, trees and tidy paved areas with gravel borders. We stayed in a one bed unit and these are spacious, clean, light and airy. The living area consisted of a large corner sofa that can be made into a spare bed, coffee table, TV and DVD player (DVD's can be rented for free and there is an extensive selection). Two large screened off (keeps out the bugs!) windows with shutters and curtains make the room warm and provide lots of light. The full size kitchen has everything you need: gas rings, electric oven, microwave, dishwasher,enormous fridge/freezer with ice maker, coffee percolator, kettle (nice touch as usually Americans do not provide kettles as they all drink coffee, so thanks for that!), blender, crockery/cutlery for 4, pots, pans, cooking dishes, washing up liquid and powder for dishwasher, tea towels and cloths. The only thing we found missing was a pair of scissors, but we coped with the extensive range of knives! The utility room has an ironing board, iron, washing basket, brush, fire extinguisher and a large, easy to use washer and dryer. A full load of washing can be done and dried in under an hour (unlike UK washers which take over an hour alone!). A small pack of washing powder is provided and when this has been used I thoroughly recommend popping to SMITHS supermarket and buying a small bottle of Tide (known as ariel actilift in UK: but is considerably better and smells lovely); Dining area has a large rectangular glass table and 4 chairs; A mini hi-fi with cassette deck, CD player and radio is provided which sounds great (I recommend station 96.3 KKLZ, which is a mix of 60's to 80's songs we all know in the UK). Outside balcony has small table and 2 chairs- we had a lovely view of the front entrance, so could watch all the activity and hot air balloons that came very close, as well as see the mountains in the distance. The bedroom has a massive (superking size) bed which is very comfortable,a TV and DVD player, bedside cabinets, stool and enormous walk-in wardrobe. The window has shutters and blackout curtains which is very useful after a late night! The good sized bathroom had a large marble worktop with basin, toilet (why are all American toilets so low to the ground??!!) and large oval shaped bath (very wide) with shower over. The whole bath is screened off with sliding doors (one of which was a bit dodgy and kept sliding off runners so we used other door!) and this is the best idea I have ever seen as it stops water going all over floor. There were loads of power sockets in each area. Our unit was upstairs so there are approx 20 steps to navigate (no lifts) but, as a person with a disabled knee I managed OK, although the gaps between the steps were not good for a fear of heights! The outside, warm pool was large (not small like some reviewer stated) with 2 waterfalls and easily accessible steps. A large, hot jacuzzi was also very welcoming after a long day of walking the strip/round hotels/ Grand Canyon etc. The pool area also has a section with barbecue grills, which seems popular with Americans, but is unusual for us Brits! There is also a gym and a few other games in reception. There is no shop/bar onsite but this is not a problem as everything you need is only a couple of minutes away in the car (or half hour plus on foot)- Sears, JCPenney, Kohls, Smiths supermarket (do not use Walmart as it is like doing the weekly shop in a wholesalers as the quantities are too big for us Brits!) plus all the usual takeways such as Burger King, McD's, pizza, KFC etc. A free shuttle bus can be booked 24 hours in advance which takes you to Smiths supermarket, the Mirage hotel and the Fremont Street experience/ Golden Nugget hotel and casino in downtown (a trip I highly recommend). Steve, one of the drivers, (a cockney who has lived in Vegas for over 20 years) is a wealth of knowledge with good advice and tips on how to get the best from Vegas and his help was much appreciated. The property is approx 6 miles from the Strip (15/20 mins by car) and is a welcome relief from the noise, lights, cigarette smoke (yes, readers, be warned that nicotine is rife in Vegas, inside casinos and everywhere outside on the strip: a fact that I was unaware of and was horrified) and constant people around that area. I highly recommend anyone visiting Vegas to stay at The Cliffs as it is home from home, a fabulous place and gives respite from the non stop lifestyle. Why pay more for a simple room in a themed hotel when you can stay in luxury with all home comforts/amenities? You would be mad to book anywhere but The Cliffs!!!

Another plus was the room in which we stayed. It was spacious, modern, new, clean, and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable, and the television received a lot of channels. The room also included laundry machines. The minus category includes a few elements: first, there was the aggressive timeshare presentation. We signed up for it to see what the big deal was and to get our \"gift\" for attending. After refusing time after time to take the timeshare, we were the last ones in the presentation, and the head manager of the timeshare scam actually started insulting and harassing us! They weren't good salespeople, anyway, because we told them that this trip was a fluke for us and we usually travel internationally. They answered, \"Okay, so let's say you've always dreamed of going to Branson, Missouri ...\" Uh, no thank you!

Our two BR unit was much improved with newly upholstered furniture, remodeled bathrooms, a kingsize very comfortable bed in the Master BR and nice linens. We enjoyed our stay! There is still a need to add WiFi access to all units, no charge. We travel quite a bit and most hotels, resorts, offer this service. They do have a computer room available to guests, with a 15 min. maximum. The computers are slow and when I prepared to print boarding passes for the return trip, I found that the computers completely shut down after 15 min. I had to log on again to complete the action. I thought that was very rude and I would have made an effort to get off ASAP. There actually was only one other guest using the computers (4 computers available and 2 laptop stations) at the time. I also thought that the next step is to provide better TV's, hopefully flat screen. This was our first visit in January, and therefore we spent more afternoon down time in the unit vs. laying around at the pool, so we really missed these conveniences.

Shuttle service to The Strip went smooth and is about a 20 minutes drive. I would recommend renting a car as all stores, restaurants, etc are just a short drive away and a taxi from the airport is expensive from what I was told (about $45.00). Red Rock Canyon is a 15 minute drive and is spectacular! Very beautiful 13 mile drive loop with an entrance fee of $7.00 a car. There are several hiking trails along the way which are worth getting out for. Just be cautious for rattle snakes and black widow spiders as you walk (though I never saw any). The only negative thing I have to say is after checking in at the front desk, I had to see the concierge desk for my parking pass. The woman was quite pushy in me attending a free breakfast/lunch to promote their timeshares. I was expecting this but was not expecting her to ask if I was married or single as I felt this was an invasive question. I was traveling with my common-law spouse and felt uncomfortable with the question as the way she asked was as if she was trying to instill her personal beliefs on me.

At the Cliffs we had a two bedroom two bath condo. It was very clean. The furniture was a little worn, but fine. I prefer a king sized bed, but the queen we slept on was quite comfortable. The light blocking curtains in the bedroom were fantastic! However, our friends' room had three square windows across the top of the wall in their room that let in light throughout the night. It was BRIGHT in there. We bought some aluminum foil and covered those after the first night. Not pretty, but problem solved. Since we didn't go to Vegas to gamble and do the night scene ONLY, we really enjoyed this place away from the hustle. I personally preferred to gamble at Red Rock Canyon Resort and Casino and Old Las Vegas on Fremont Street instead of the Strip. The dealers were friendly and the slots seemed looser...........? Although we rented a car to get to Red Rock Canyon(hiked there twice, 15 mins from the Cliffs) and the Hoover Dam (1 hour drive), we usually took the shuttle to go to the Strip or Fremont Street. What a convenience! The shuttle leaves roughly on the hour and drops you at the Mirage. You return on the half hour from the Mirage. One night we went to Fremont street from 6:00 until 10:30 on the shuttle. There are many great restaurants around the Cliffs. Our personal favorite was Rosemary's restaurant(elegant evening out), but Capriotti's(sandwiches) and Viva Mercado (Mexican) were excellent, as well. All of these places were within 5 to 10 minutes from the Cliffs. The pool area was very nice and clean. We enjoyed relaxing there several afternoons. Wifi is available for $10 per day, but when my husband called the provider we received a week's connection for $50. The front desk was always helpful and cheerful. They seemed quite happy to answer any questions we had. The only negative regarding this stay was the noise. There were several Large people who were staying above us. Lots of loud stomping that echoed through our ceiling and literally rattled the light fixtures whenever they were in their condo. Thankfully, I took along a pair of earplugs, so I managed to block out the noise at night.

This is a quiet resort away from the crowds and noise of the strip. It has a great shuttle service that will take you to and from the strip by simply making a reservation a short time in advance of when you wish to go there. The shuttle will also take you to a nearby grocery store where you can buy whatever supplies you wish if you decide to cook or barbecue while you stay. (We used the shuttle to get us to the resort in the first place because we had decided not to rent a car while in Vegas and so all we had to do was take a taxi to the Mirage from the airport and catch their shuttle from there). The rooms are spacious and clean, the kitchens are well stocked with whatever you may need if you wish to save money and fix your own meals. The pool is not spectacular, but is certainly adequate and includes a separate spa. The furnishing around the pool are very good. They also have a very nice exercise room, pool table and barbecues available for their guests use. Areas that I think need improvement are housekeeping. As stated above the room was very clean and I have no concerns there, however, our first night there the room next to us was cleaned and all the trash, dirty towels etc. were left lying on the ground next to our entry way. We called the front desk to alert them to this and they said they would have someone come and pick them up. Well that never happened, so this all sat outside our door over night until late the next morning. The resort also has an area near the pool where they encourage guest to recycle, glass, paper, plastic, etc. which I applaud. The only problem is that no one seems to have the responsibility of emptying the bins regularly, so on two occasions these bins were overflowing onto the sidewalk around the area including broken glass on at least one occasion. Secondly, the resort has a practice at check in of sending you to someone who pushes very hard to have you sign up for a \"complimentary breakfast\" which of course leads you into a sales pitch. The lady who pushed us into this assured us of no hard sale and no more than an hour of your time. Neither is true. The sales pitch took us an hour and half and that was only because we insisted on leaving at that point. Once the first salesperson is done with you they will send you to another \"manager to sign off on your paperwork and then will send you to one more to get their final offer. Perhaps they have a different definition of hard sale than I do, but it sure fit my description. My advice is to just say no, although if you do you can be assured that they will not quit asking. If you do say no long enough they will probably raise their initial offer of what you will receive for subjugating yourself to the sales pitch. If you are in the market for the vacation time they are trying to sale to you, then do not pay the initial asking price which was $11,000 +, but was suddenly $3000 + when we had said no and were heading for the door. Finally, this resort has no free wireless. When free wireless is offered to patrons of Motel Six and other cheap hotels and motels and when it can be had at most customer friendly businesses, I can find no excuse for a place advertising itself as a top end resort to charge $10.00 a day for this service. No one wants to sit in your computer room to use the internet and then get booted off every fifteen minutes because of the time limits you have imposed on computer use there. Overall, I would go here again, but I would also look at other options first and seriously consider my choices before taking this one.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NE PA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Las Vegas location off the Strip\u201d", "Author": "mamabNePa", "ReviewID": "UR100406301", "Content": "We stayed in a one bedroom condo unit for a week in early March.

We stayed here in a 2 Bedroom suite with our kids for a family vacation to see some Vegas shows, Hoover Dam, Valley of Fire, with a swimming pool to come back to for a cooldown from sightseeing, so it suited our needs as a home base.

We are all in our late 20's. Before checking into the Cliffs I read many reviews. All in all, I found our experience to be VERY good, and found most of the reviews to be petty and negative. Upon checking in we were greeted nicely and were given the time share talk, however after quickly saying we were not interested we were able to walk away. This was done in UNDER 5 minutes. They did call us once during the stay to ask if we had been introduced to the time share opportunity and I simply said we weren't interested, NO BIG DEAL! The grounds on the Cliffs property were beautiful and the hot tub was GREAT! We also loved our 2 bedroom condo unit. While some things were outdated as another guest put it, we had no trouble making the best of everything we were given. We also spent minimal time in our room because we were always out sight seeing or enjoying the pool/hot tub, thus at the end of the day we had no complaints. It was wonderful to come back to a cool room with a stocked fridge and a comfortable bed. We also had no trouble with noise outside our room or with other patrons/staff. The only issue we had with the Cliffs was the distance from the strip. BUT, we knew this going into it! Thus we can't really complain. The shuttle ran from 10am until 11:30pm and two of the drivers were EXCELLENT! The other drive we did not so much care for, but oh well. Because we often stayed out later than 11:30pm it was a hassle and expensive to take cabs back to the cliffs. But, once again we figured this would be the case before we arrived. People also complained about making a reservation for the free shuttle, which was really no big deal. Usually the day before when we made our plans for the following day I called down to the front desk and made our reservation. We only had trouble one time the entire 6 days we there getting the shuttle we wanted. And even then, we just picked the later one, once again no big deal! I also made and changed many shuttle reservations the same day we were taking them. The staff is willing to be flexible for you if you are patient and friendly to them.

We went to Red Rock Casino a few miles away to kill a few hours, and that worked out well. Once we got in our unit and assessed what we would need from the store, we headed to close-by Wal-Mart, which is also an enormous grocery store. Best to go with a specific list made in advance, otherwise you will be overwhelmed and spend hours there. The unit included two small boxes of laundry detergent. I always bring a few dryer sheets (how easy that is for packing), and I also bring my own small plastic bottle of detergent, just in case. There were four adults, so we did use all of it, although I imagine you could get more. There is a small bottle of dish soap in the kitchen, plenty of towels and potholders, paper towels, toilet tissue, and facial tissue is there, with excess in the vantities. There are also plenty of trash bags, but the bags are terrible quality and break easily, so be careful. The beds are all queen sized. I knew this before I went, so I want to say I wasn't disappointed, but I still was. Every time I trade my timeshare, we have a large king-bedroom and usually a whirlpool tub. I have king at home, so we found the queen a little challenging. My last few trades have also had amazing mattresses and great sheets. I did not find this to be the case at the Cliffs. One of our face towels in the master bath was so threadbare and grayish that it looked like a car washing towel. Nothing was plush, same for the pool towels. I hated the comforter and blanket on the bed, the scratchy, not comfy type. The room was small and wouldn't have accommodated a king bed, though, so there is nothing they can do about that. I was underwhelmed by the master bath. There was a long countertop but only one sink, and it was so low by todays' standards. Very dated. Shower was fine, great water pressure, and the tub was a bit oversized and quite comfortable. Minimal towels given. We didn't need to use any front desk services, but the people there seemed very pleasant. The pool area and hot tub area were just lovely, very well maintained, and the four built-in gas grills are fantastic. The area where the grills are is well lit and very clean. We grilled outside twice, and it was fantastic. Near the grills is an outdoor fireplace for those wanting to eat outdoors at the high-top table by the fireplace. If you like to exercise on vacation, the fitness center leaves much to be desired, in my opinion. Two treadmills, neither calibrated to the right speed or incline. The belt was loose on one of them, and they are dated . There are NO free weights at all. Two treadmills, 3 bikes, 1 eliptical, and a universal. The area is small and hot. People were propping the door open with the trashcan. No towels provided in the gym, and I can honestly say I haven't been to a resort through my RCI trades that didn't offer towels and cleaning solutions in the gym to disinfect the equipment after someone sweats on it. The fireplace in the living room of this two-bedroom unit was wonderful - turn on with a switch and really warmed you up nicely. The kitchen was equipped with what we needed for cooking. The cabinets and vanities should ALL be replaced immediately. They are old, rotting in parts, difficult to operate. There is nothing updated whatsoever as far as vanities and cabinets. I'm on vacation, I want to feel like I am being pampered. I read on Trip Advisor to ask for a second floor unit due to bugs. We did not see a single bug and we did have a second floor unit. The unit was very clean when we arrived. Horribly, at 5:00 a.m. or at 6:00 a.m. EVERY DAY, the maintenance people are dragging pool chairs around while they are cleaning - the noise is like nails on a chalkboard. And we were on the second floor!!!! They are noisily dragging trash cans around and pool chairs. It is not fun to wake up that early in the morning because of loud noise dragging around by your unit. The shuttle service provided by the Cliffs is TOP NOTCH. Their system is working wonderfully - you make a reservation to go to the strip or Freemont Street, and you have a seat on the van - a beautiful, comfortable van. Steve is an amazing asset to the resort, if you are lucky enough to get him as your driver. There are three drivers that we saw during our week. They are efficient and always on time. They'll drop you off to do grocery shopping, too, and come back for you. Extremely accommodating and easy to use. We had a rental car and still used the shuttle almost every day. Be sure to tip these guys. There is no free wifi in the rooms, kind of unheard of these days, but they do have a computer room where you can go online and print for free. I brought my laptop because I needed to check in with work all week, and it cost me $50 to have internet access in the room. If you are staying at the Cliffs, be sure to visit Red Rock Resort and Casino - it is lovely. Check out their pool area, beautiful! The casino is really nice there, and it's only about 10 minutes away (you'll need a car, the shuttle doesn't go there). In closing, although we had a wonderful vacation, enjoyed the weather and being with our friends, had a fun time in Las Vegas, this is not a resort we would chose again in the future. With the maintenance fees and dues we pay for our timeshare, we can get much better. I think we actually lost money on this trade, as I imagine we could have rented it for less than our fees and trade upgrade.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, almost runined by presentation though\u201d", "Author": "Emma-Sussex", "ReviewID": "UR25185570", "Content": "This hotel or resort is lovely.

We just bought some grocerries at Smith's supermarket (the shuttle can take you there.. just ask the driver) and we were able to eat dinner at \"home.\" There is free DVD rentals (not so many choices), there is a computer lab, workout room, BBQ area, jacuzzi, pool table and beautiful pool. There were a few brave souls in the pool, but I was freezing. When I was rested, I took the shuttle to the strip for some quick gambling and to watch the Bellagio fountains. The shuttle is a godsend.

Be sure to return them by the due date or else you will paying quite a bit for them even if yuo do return them. They also have computers with internet access that you can use free of charge. They are a little older models so don't expect to be able to charge your IPOD on them. The rooms were nice and met my expectations. The pictures posted on this site and other sites (Expedia, Orbitz etc) are consistent with what you can expect. Please note though that the pool area is smaller than it appears. If you are debating between renting a car and not renting a car, I advise that you do rent a car so that you are able to enjoy some of the farther attractions without having to pay to go on tours.

We were in Vegas for the first time with our two children ages 12 & 15. We found the place no problem thanks to our GPS in the rental car. It is about 15 minutes from the strip. The lobby was really nice. There was a pool table, internet room, and another room off to the side with a large tv and couches. Also had free coffee and tea. The front desk staff was very friendly. We were able to pick our two bedroom unit for what was available. I could have had one overlooking the beautiful pool. I thought it would be to noisey so I went for a quiet one in the back. It was very quiet until about 6 am when the airplanes started taking off from the airport. There is a big controversy in Vegas right now about the FAA allowing the airplanes to make a right hand turn over residential neighborhoods to ease congestion. That is probably what was happening to us. I haven't read anyone else complain about noise from the airport so this must be something new. It wasn't all that bad and I would stay here again in a minute. There was a washer and dryer in the unit which was a great convenience. They supplied two boxes of Tide and if you needed more which I did you could buy it from the front desk for 1.00 a box. The shuttle ran only to the Belagio and you had to make reservations to take it. It ran until 1:30 am. We didn't use that. We had a rental car and it was very easy to get onto the strip. No problem to get there and back. My kids used the pool and jacuzzi on our first night there. They said the pool was warm which is rare. They enjoyed it. The unit is supplied with plenty of towels for bath and pool use. They also supply dishwashing soap, papertowels, etc. There is so much shopping only blocks away. Went to a super Walmart and got what we needed. I had some minor issues with a broken hairdryer which they came and fixed immediately. Our dvd player was on so our tv was snowey. They came right up and took care of that. If you want to rent a safe which I suggest you do it's only 10.00 for your entire stay. I had a problem programming it and I called the front desk. Someone was there in less than 5 minutes to help us out. We went to Red Rock Canyon which is about 15 minutes away. This is a great place to stay if you're looking for a quiet, comfortable, clean place to stay off the strip. Book this place.

It is located about 15 minutes west of The Strip (by car), straight down Flamingo Road. There is TONS of shopping in the area - anything you need is in easy reach. The units are very large and clean. We had no problems at all. I recommend you use a car for the area (depending on how you vacation), that way you can explore the full potential of the area (like Red Rock Canyon, only 20 minutes away, or Hoover Dam, only 45 minutes away from the resort). We didn't use the free shuttle. There's a nice pool area and fitness room, and you can rent free movies at the front desk for those off nights when you're not seeing a show. Do not book your shows ahead of time. Use the TIX4TONIGHT locations and get them at discounted prices. We saved big time on David Copperfield and Cirque's Mystere. That's definitely your best bet! Unless a certain show isn't discounting, you can get good seats at discounted prices to probably 80% of shows in Vegas on any given night with this company. Oh yeah, and if you plan on going on the brand new Skywalk at Grand Canyon West, it is NOT just park there, spend $25 a head and walk on this thing - you have to buy a package to GET there by bus for $50 a head, then buy your $25 admission to the Skywalk ON TOP of that. Total is around $80 a head to walk on the Skywalk, which is a HUGE rip off. Go all the way to Grand Canyon Nat'l Park instead or the North Rim to see the Grand Canyon. The Hulapai dropped the ball on this one.
