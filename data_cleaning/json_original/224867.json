Lauderdale made the subject of my prior review. This location appeared to be a fairly new hotel 7 miles from Miami airport. My queen bed room included a 2 burner countertop, sink, full size fridge and a small microwave. The Fort Lauderdale location was a \u201cDeluxe\u201d which from what I could tell the only difference was a better equipped kitchen since the room size appeared the same. This location also had free parking, and this chain offers basic housekeeping for $3/day for stays less than a week and Wi-Fi at $4.99. Surprisingly, for such a new hotel, the room had a very small 19 inch CRT tube TV instead of a flat screen which was disappointing. The bed was comfortable, although the pillows were not and the room was quiet. The shower was hot and powerful. Wal-Mart is located less than a mile down the road, as are numerous places to eat, many within walking distance. The staff was very helpful, and for a basic airport stay in Miami, this hotel is recommended and was a good value at only $50/night.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Salvador, El Salvador", "Title": "\u201cExcelent Hotel great value\u201d", "Author": "eahaas", "ReviewID": "UR122461786", "Content": "Loved it!

I gave 4 stars for cleanliness because I am very picky about it. It wasn't spotless but it was very clean, let's put it this way. Service was great! We took a shuttle almost everyday to the airport, and from their we just took the city bus #150 to the beach. It was very convenient, especially if you are a saver. The neighborhood is pretty safe. We had to walk late at night a few times and never saw anything unusual. There are a few restaurants in the walking distance: Red Lobster, Chili's, and some others. There's a Walmart also, but it is quite far. You could walk to it, but to carry your groceries back to the hotel would be more problematic. I had chosen this hotel because of reviews on this website, and I am glad I did. Miami beach hotels are quite expensive, and I have read horror stories with the bugs and roaches about them. I was very satisfied with this hotel, and especially for the price!

There is a kitchenette that is very well kept, with a full sized fridge, microwave, toaster coffee maker, stove top and utensils. There was even an ice tray in the freezer. The service was great from check-in and I was ill after my flight and was allowed with no additional hassle to check in early. I had to call the front office more than once, for advice of places to eat and for special items and even with a change of front office staff, I found the service to be excellent. The hotel has a shuttle that picks you up from the airport and the drive to the hotel from MIA is about 10-15 minutes. The hotel is in an office park, so a car is advisable if you want food. There is Chilli's within about 5 blocks if you choose to walk. Otherwise, they are flyers as well as great recommendations from the front desk. Quite a few restaurants in the locale delivers for as little as $2.50.

Our problems started with the hotel shuttle from the airport. After waiting for a half an hour after we called, a van from the hotel finally came to pick us up at about 8:00 in the evening, but our driver, who could not understand much English, proceeded to get lost or confused or both on the way back to the hotel, leading to a bizarre and scary experience for my husband and me. After we had left the airport, our driver said he had to go back to find someone. So he started to go back, but somehow got lost. I asked him if he could please take us to the hotel and then go back to look for the person, but he kept talking, mumbling and driving up and down these dark streets calling and talking to someone on his cell phone. This went on for half an hour and he kept saying he could not understand us and we could not understand him. So we were driving around Miami until we finally ended up back at the airport! I then demanded that he stop and let us out and my husband was actually opening the door before we stopped so that we could get out and get a taxi to the hotel. He could not speak enough English to communicate with us and he gave my husband his cell phone to talk to someone at the hotel, but we had had enough of him and I was too scared to be driving with him at this point, so we took a $25 cab to the hotel. The cab driver was very nice and very concerned that we were at the right place, which was comforting after our scary ride. The girl at the desk refunded our cab and said she could not understand how this could happen, and assured us that he would not be driving the morning shuttle back to the airport the next day. However, she never apologized. The room was ok...no remote for the tv...nothing special, kind of dingy. We ate at Shorty's, next door which was good. The next morning, we couldn't wait to leave and the shuttle showed up at 8:40 when it was promised at 8:00. Again, the guy at the front desk, never apologized.
