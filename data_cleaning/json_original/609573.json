She was shocked to find that on 18 July 2011 the emailed her to tell her that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153today the card is good!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite advising her that the hotel would cancel the booking if no other card details were supplied, and despite not receiving any other credit card, the hotel continued to try to process the original card. Clearly, the hotel was at fault on two counts: 1. The hotel broke its word by saying the booking would be cancelled if no further card detail was provided. 2.

The hotel is approached from the darkest narrowest alley i have ever seen and it is a bit soul destroying to be honest. However when we opened the door we were met by a lovely receptionist who showed us to two of our rooms and allowed us to check in although we were very early. The hotel is boutique style, very minimal, the rooms are basic, with modern bathrooms which are exceptionally clean having excellent fittings and the normal complimentary shampoo, soap etc. Towels changed daily are the thin cotton type no fluffy ones. Sheets very white and looked new, no english channels on the t.v. The breakfast room was a corridor outside one of our family members room. Breakfast is the normal continental, perfectly adequate and you could watch the gondaliers rowing past. The hotel has a sister hotel across the square and you are given a voucher for the restaurant outside which is also attached to both hotels. There are no tea or coffee making facilities and nothing else offered or available which is a shame as they have a coffee machine in reception. The best restaurant we found is out of hotel, turn left, and left again continue over the bridge, it can be found on the right hand side and looks as if it is outside with a canopy, which it is!!, best in the area by far. My tip would be enjoy the tourist menus which include tax AND service charges you will get stung for the 2 charges if you eat off the normal menu. The best thing about this hotel is the location you are barely 5 minutes from water taxi stop, and 5 minutes from St Marks Sq, with all its attractions.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cexpensive and overpriced\u201d", "Author": "florencehippo", "ReviewID": "UR16021919", "Content": "Minibar fridge did not work, the light was on but everything inside it was warm.

No lid on the waste bin in the bathroom Staff usually on duty at their other hotel, next door, so no 24 hour reception. Price was horrendous for a three star.....240 Euros per night!! The canal view is more brick wall than canal. Worst of all.....a member of reception staff unlocked the door in the late afternoon and walked in on us when we were in the middle of showering, getting ready to go out again. Quite embarrassing when you are in the buff.! No excuse for this, because there is an electronic key system in use which illuminates a red light outside the door when the room isoccupied, so that was rather upsetting. The manageress of the hotel was not at all apologetic for this and made usfeel as though it was OUR fault for being in our room! We definitely would not stay there again at the price.

Upon finding the hotel down a small alleyway off the main square we were welcomed and shown to our lovely room 104. The room was spacious with an open beamed ceiling, modern furnishings and a canal view from both windows. Te bathroom was mosaic tiled in blue and white with a power shower, wc, bidet and sink. The hotel was spotless and had obviously been fitted out fairly recently. Breakfast was lovely with a wide selection including salami, cheeses, toast, bread, cake, fruit salad and cereals. Good coffee served by very friendly staff who I managed to communicate with despite knowing next to no italian! The hotel was fantastic and the only slight moan was our room was very cold as the heating was not working iin our room. They did supply us with two small heaters which did warm things up. The rest of the hotel seemed warm enough. The towels in the rooms are not soft and fluffy, but very fine white cotton, almost like an english tablecloth! They were very clean and soft but we much preferred the english style of towel for comfort, especially when in a cold room! The Hotel is centrally located and is a 5 minute stroll to St Marks' square or 10 minutes to Rialto. I cannot remember the name of our favourite restaurant, but if you go out of the hotel and turn left, then left again and after 15m you will come to a little bridge crossing the canal that runs behind the restaurant. At the side of the bridge on the right hand side is a small tratoria noset back. It was beautiful food, the cuttlefish in black sauce is a winner. Make sure you take trip to the markets near Rialto. Another good restaurant is DiMarco, in the San Polo area. For fantastic pizza visit Bora Bora, which is up a small alley way opposite the street that takes you onto the Rialto Bridge. Great house wine too. We had a fantastic time in Venice and would definitely return to this hotel. I booked direct with the hotel's website and paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 per room per night.

It is clean, modern and the location is fantastic. Oh, and it was an amazing value (EUR 70 per night, including taxes, fees and a breakfast for two). But in order to achieve the value a place like the Tiepolo offers, you have to be willing to sacrifice a few things. Service would be one... There was no one staffing the desk at the hotel - each time you wanted to get in the front door, you had to go to the neighboring hotel to have someone walk over and unlock the door. Although this was a little tedious, it did not dampen our stay. (Admittedly, we were at the hotel during a period of low occupancy so it might differ during high season.) The location is great. The hotel is just off a small square about a five minute walk from the San Zaccaria vaporetto (the \"water bus\") stop and a little less from Piazza San Marco. The entrance is a little hard to find the first time, but the map provided by the hotel with our reservation confirmation lead us right to the door. I would recommend printing it out and keeping it handy for your arrival. The hotel is new, so the finishings are pristine. Stylistically, it is a nice blend of simple, modern design and the classic features of the building. It is a perfect haven for those who shudder at the thought of spending the night in a room overwhelmed by Venetian styling (faux frescos, gold-painted bed posts and draping fabrics - yuck!). Our room (no. 109) was small, but functional. It offered all of the required amenities, including an in-room safe and a small refrigerator. (For those needing Internet access, there is an Internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 just around the corner from the hotel.) Surprisingly, the bathroom was large enough to support a bidet and full-sized bathtub without feeling cramped. The view from our room was not too exciting as it consisted of the building next door - only about three meters away. Breakfast is served in a long, narrow room. It is a bit like eating in a galley (or a subway car as the person sitting next to us remarked), but is perfectly manageable. There is a large, glass door at the end of the room that provides a view onto a small, side canal. The fare is pretty standard for a three-star hotel - fresh breads, sausage and cheeses, cereal and yogurts. Nothing exceptional, but perfectly acceptable. The Tiepolo has several related restaurants nearby. They offer a 10% discount off the total meal (alcohol included), which almost completely offsets the standard \"service fee\" charged by Venetian restaurants for occupying a table. We ate at Aciugheta our first night and were pleased. The food was reasonably priced and of good quality, although we did have a bit of trouble finding a wine on their list that they actually had available. The Tiepolo is not perfect, but it is a fantastic value. If I had paid the posted rack rate of our room (EUR 250), I might have felt ripped off. But at only EUR 70 a night, I instead felt like I got more than my money's worth and was pleased with our stay.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milano", "Title": "\u201cChe bell'Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5231216", "Content": "Io ed un mio amico siamo stati deliziati da questa permanenza in terra veneziana...lo suggerisco davvero a chi vuole risiedere a due passsi da Piazza San Marco e goddere la tranquillit\u00c3\u00a0 delle callette strette di Venezia.
