A street full of different cafes and restaurants nearby. Anatolia Suites is perfect for a small family, if you are more than a couple and you want to have more than just one hotel room. And it is much cheaper than taking two hotel rooms. They have two small two-rooms apartments on each floor. We had the one on the third floor with a sea view. Probably that was the best. A bathtub in each suite is really a rare thing for the centrally situated hotels in big cities, in Istanbul as well. Breakfast is simple and nice, and on the upper terrace with a beautiful view on the Marmara sea and Bosphorus. I would recommend going to the Marmara sea embankment which is close, and is not much mentioned in guide books. On a sunny day it is so nice to have lunch at on of the restaurants near the fish market, where they make fish you have just chosen.

I was looking more for an authentic experience rather than a usual hotel stay and I came across Anatolia Suites website, and each suite is a 1 bdr room apt (bigger then my NYC studio!)- one of them even has a turkish bath within the suite! The best part was - the rates beat hotel room prices! It got better when I got there, the hotel is very centrally located walking distance within a few blocks of the Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia and many more museums etc. I had heard of Turkish Hospitality but got to live it first hand here, the staff was incredibelly nice and accomadating. The hotel itself was impecabbly clean. I recommend everybody who is planning a visit to Istanbul to stay here.", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Anatolia Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1102362-Reviews-Anatolia_Suites-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$105 - $194*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Sultanahmet Mahallesi, Ogul Sokak No:8</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34110</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1102362", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c1/99/39/anatolia-suites.jpg"}}
