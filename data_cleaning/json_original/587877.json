{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Value But..... A group of us from the US stayed here for 8 nights. The hotel is pretty clean and definitely a good price. The problem was that speaking to anyone in the hotel was impossible. Even the people at the front desk could speak a little english but I am not sure they really understood what we were saying. We all used the concierge at the Crowne Plaza at the corner and that was great. This location is great and like I said it is good for the price but I would choose to pay a little more and get a place with a few more ammenities especially if it was my first time in China.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR614826648", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "rdbkbear"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d587877-r7908226-Times_Holiday_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "587877", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
