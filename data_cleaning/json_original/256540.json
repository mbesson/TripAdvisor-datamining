The staff was friendly and helpful, the location was convenient for business, the room amenities (bathroom, TV, A/C) all solid, and access to/from restaurants owned by the group that owns the hotel (Merivale) was excellent. In fact, at one of their premium spots on a difficult to book night, I was given perhaps the best table in the restaurant (and my reservation was booked by the Establishment Hotel staff). There is one minor drawback and one major one. If you travel to Sydney and you're looking for \"views\" of the Harbour or Opera House, you won't get it here (I was not expecting it). This is an older hotel in an older building and your \"view\" is more likely to be of the building next door. The one major drawback, and it's a big one, is you have to be prepared for noise. I'm not talking about noise from restaurants or clubs (as mentioned in other reviews) which I did not notice during my stay. I'm talking about noise from outside the building at 3am or 5am of trucks unloading, garbage trucks, trucks with back up beepers, and other general external substantial very early AM noise. I don't know if this is due to the location of the hotel, or the age of the windows in the building simply allowing in a lot of outside noises, or perhaps both. So, if you are a heavy sleeper and can tolerate the noise at all hours of the night, I can wholeheartedly recommend a stay. If you cannot, unfortunately, this is not a good fit for you.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cA nice find\u201d", "Author": "Linda R", "ReviewID": "UR126706909", "Content": "Establishment Hotel is in the financial district of Sydney.

The location, service and room all exceeded our expectations - the hotel is situated a short walk away from both Darling Harbour & Circular Quay as well as the main shopping areas in the city so we were never far from anything to do, see or places to eat and drink. The hotel staff were excellent also, from front desk to service staff. However where the hotel scores highest for us is with its style and it's massive suite-style rooms. The hotel lobby is very cool and links in to one of the bars and everything looks spot-on! The room that we stayed in was immaculate - probably the biggest room we've ever stayed in with a huge, very comfortable bed. We'd read reviews on here that the rooms suffered from being really noisy due to the proximity of the hotel's asscoiated bars and club but, considering we were staying on a Friday and Saturday night and the fact that I'm a very light sleeper, we found it not to be a problem (they do also provide ear plugs if necessary).

There was also guides to the hotel's bars and restaurants as well as other restaurants around Sydney which are part of the same group. The bed was comfy and the temperature perfect. It might not be great for light sleepers though as due to the wooden floors you can hear footsteps from rooms above. You also hear all the noise of rubbish vans collecting bottles at 5am - I didn't mind it and there are earplugs on offer in the bathroom as an amineity. The hotel staff are friendly, smart and helpful. On the other hand, the staff in the \"Hemmesphere\" bar are more preoccupied with being cool than delivering decent service! On the downside, the bathroom toiletries were only average, I would have expected something a bit cooler than what was on offer. Also, the shower door leaked - looks like the developer cut some corners in not digging out the shower room to allow for proper drainage.

At check-in everything seemed okay. When we got to our room, however, it was another story. The room was worn and tired and although we like the whole industrial vibe, it didn't feel like a luxury hotel. The shower leaked heavily onto the bathroom floor and they never brought us extra towels we asked for. During our night's sleep people kept waling in and out of another room and we heard every time the door opened and closed. I think they realize how much they lack in soundproofing because one of the amenities is earplugs. After the first trip up to our room our key stopped working for the elevator and had to get a replacement. The hallways are dark and unkept and the \"breakfast\" is a joke!!! As far as the \"scene\" it is AMAZING!!! The bar gets full by 6pm and you are definitely in a hotspot. We ate at \"etc.\" which was excellent and probably one of our top meals in Australia. We wished the service at the hotel was as good as in the restaurant. Above all else the price is ridiculous especially for what you get.

Our nine night stay at the Establishment really set the most wonderful tone for the trip. The most critical component is the staff ... they are young, fun, personable, and enthusiastic. Their 'can-do' attitude permeates everything that they do to make the guests feel as if they are at home ... there are truly 'no worries', and although they are relaxed and casual, they are incredible professional! Both Sarahs, Alex, Danielle, Bob, Brigitte, and of course the master of coffee Cris all made each day so special, and we appreciate all that they did ... more like seeing friends then hotel staff. The hotel itself is incredibly well located - in the heart of Sydney, which is extremely easy to navigate (courteous drivers, helpful citizens, etc.). Just a few moments from Circular Quay and the Opera House; at the foot of shops and downtown restaurants; and easy drive to Surry Hills, Potts Point (walkable actually), Bondi, and Manly (the even provided us with beach towels when we hit the ocean!). The rooms are spacious and sumptuous - and unlike many hotels, everything works - easliy! Wifi is great, as are the huge and spa-like bathrooms. There are touch screen controls on the phone - which may seem complicated, but are so intuitive ... you press an icon, and it does what it's supposed to! Flat screen tv's, ipod docking, speakers, neatly concealed power points. The rooms are in excellent condition, beautifully cleaned and maintained. Turn down is lovely, with homemade cookies left for guests. The vibe is totally a-list and clubby, without being stark or cold - rather, warm and inviting. By the way, we had read some reviews about noise in the hotel, and I emailed the front desk to see if they could allay my concerns. They graciously put us on the top floor at the end of the hotel, ensuring silent nights, which was greatly appreciated! We thought that the hotel was an excellent value - breakfast was lovely in the Gin Garden, and Cris made each morning special. We had the buffet, which was plenty and yummy - from the latt\u00c3\u00a9s to the delicious greek yogurt with honey and toasted granola. A great way to refuel after hitting the gym (small but well lit and with everything one would need to get a great workout). Lastly, my wife and I had dinner at Est on a Saturday evening, while our kids ate at Sushi E (both located in the hotel). The food was stunning, as was the service - we could not have had a more special evening. The staff at Est also had the same friendly but professional and knowledgeable vibe as the hotel. The food was artful, and we enjoyed an incredible and relaxed time. We popped around to the Ivy down the street after dinner, arranged quickly by Herv\u00c3\u00a9, the lovely manager of Est. He also walked our kids back to their room after their sushi dinner - how sweet is that? I would not stay anywhere else in Sydney, which has few boutique hotels ... most places are monolithic blocks where guests are just a number.

Some warnings though - having stayed previously at the hotel on a weekend, it does get noisy, due to the fact that there is a club underneath you. However, if you like excitement and late night partying - you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the noise. Overall, I was generally happy with the friendly staff and service and the hotel itself is very luxurious and worth bragging about. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a great location and you really feel part of the city but still feel relaxed and at ease inside the hotel.

The Establishment is in about as central a location as it's possible to get in Sydney CBD - a five-minute walk to both Circular Quay and Town Hall. The entrance took a little finding, tucked away in a backstreet, which we didn't actually mind; it has an air of exclusivity and class. The room itself was beautiful; we were in a corner room, so not sure if all the others are as nice but it was much larger than average, with a huge marble bathroom & Bose stereo system playing soft classical music on arrival. There was absolutely no discernible traffic noise inside the room, even at 11pm on a Saturday, which is pretty impressive for its extremely central location. The company that owns The Establishment also owns a slew of Sydney's clubs, bars & restaurants, like Establishment Bar and Ivy Nightclub. We had our anniversary dinner in their Italian restaurant, Ucello, which overlooks the Ivy rooftop swimming pool. Spectacular food. Not cheap - $300 incl wine for the two of us - but fantastic food (my partner couldn't quite finish hers and she was a little disappointed with herself for leaving any), fantastic service (they knew we had to leave early for our show and they timed it all perfectly) and beautiful surroundings. We also got champagne on arrival included with our hotel booking. The Establishment is possibly a little off the radar - I for one didn't know they had a hotel until a friend told me about it, thought it was just the bar - but I couldn't recommend it more.

The bathroom (despite the huge shower window w views of The Office staff directly across the alley) was beautiful & spacious. The hotel is connected to a series of bars & restaurants. We ate at the Sushi restaurant & had drinks at one of the other bars. My advice is to stay elsewhere (the Park Hyatt if it's w/in your budget for sure) & come here for the nightlife. P.S. This insanely narrow alley proved to be quite the problem upon our departure at the crack of dawn the next day. Since you can only enter one way & exit the other, we were unable to leave as a thuggish looking punk left his car parked in front of said exit & smartly left his buddy to watch the car w/o leaving him the keys.

At first glance, the room seemed attractive - if you like that hard edged, modern look. However, it was so difficult to use and be in.

After that followed trying to find the power point in the bathroom and working out how to use the lights (icons had worn off all the buttons). Tap was ridiculously difficult to use and the basin was far too deep and low. No towel rail. Eventually found the kettle, hidden in a cupboard nowhere near the fridge or the counter where it needed to be plugged in. No side tables near the bed - only a very high bed head behind it which meant you had to stretch up and turn around to put tea, water, glasses etc high up behind you and not at all within reach. Floor had a deep step running across its whole width - I spent the entire time worrying I'd fall down it. Not enough surface space to sit and work. A rug made out of a skinned animal - yuck. Chain on blind broke when I drew it down to block out the view from the windows of the building opposite - only a few feet away. Having given up and gone to bed to read, the ridiculous lamps perched on the high bed head didn't cast enough light to see the pages properly (even when turned up high). When I gave up on that and decided to turn in, I couldn't work out how to extinguish all the lights in the room (second call to reception who explained that I needed to use the touch screen controls on the telephone - why didn't I think of that?). The rest of the night was spent tossing and turning, being woken up every single time another load of empties was crashed into the skip in the alley alongside the hotel.

I later found out that the pub is rated a Level 2 premise by the NSW Government (which means restrictions apply aimed at reducing alcohol-related violence and anti-social behaviuour and that 12-18 assaults take place on or around the premises each year). Once in our room the disappointment was huge. Yes, they are trying hard to make it look hip and the room does look cool if you don't look to close but the furniture and the finishes in general have a cheap feel to them. Our room had a shabby view and was very dark. Yes, I know, that's the way a lot of so called boutique hotels in NYC look like but i still prefer a truly stylish, bright hotel room with quality finishes. The shower was leaking and the position of the tap in the shower (opposite wall) was very inconvenient. The worst of all, however, was a loud noise during the whole night presumably coming from a pipe or similar.

It is decorated minimally in light neutral colors. There is incense burning in the lobby. There is an abstract-artsy type metal waterfall in their breakfast room. My room was understated (in a tasteful way) but high-tech. The telephone doubled as some kind of room control computer. I know this because the porter checked my room temperature and turned on the (highly efficient) vacuum fan by pressing a button on the telephone. Every light in the room was on a dimmer-switch that could be controlled by switches by the door and probably by telephone. Also if I got up in the middle of the night, I could touch the telephone and it would light up so I could find the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and there was a huge flat screen TV. Service was outstanding. At my single request at the front desk, they brought up cappuccino and oranges within 5 minutes after my wakeup call, whenever that was. They escorted me to my room whenever I went up, although this may be because my elevator card wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working right. The receptionist called to determine if I needed help getting to dinner on time and came up to my room to help me put on a necklace. And most people in Sydney already know this: They leave big delicious chocolate and chocolate-chip cookies on your bed every day. I had been told by Fodorites that there was no view from rooms in the Establishment, but when I entered my room the first time, I asked the porter to open the shades anyway, expecting to see brick walls. I did not see brick walls. What I saw was amazing: the well-lit fifth floor of a full office in busy mode. You see, outside the Establishment building there is a narrow alleyway, and then the next building, which was almost all glass. There were very busy offices in this glass building. I was told they were offices of a bank. The many personnel there paid me no attention although they had to see me, unless they were in a different dimension. I had brought binoculars, and considered using them to read their computer screens and whatever memos they were frantically running around with, but I was afraid I might be arrested.

I will say the staff are quite young, but very enthusiastic. The only thing I would suggest to the hotel is to update some of their technology, the TVs are pretty dated (cmon guys, flat screens please) and you have to connect to the internet with a cable (no wireless) but at least the internet is complimentary. They were very helpful with printing out or boarding passes for the plane and nothing really was too much trouble.

Hemmesphere was a fantastic bar, very comfortable, classy and has full wait service and even easier you can charge it to your room. For cheaper food, you can't go past the Garden Bar, which is great food at pub grub prices. The location is great, about halfway between the Pitt Street mall and Circular Quay.

I found the hotel because I read some good reviews in travel forums and even it sounded great on paper I was a bit nervous as Sydney was a special place for us in this trip and I wanted the hotel to be up to it, but as I did not know the group I was not sure it was going to be so good. Fortunately not only we were not dissapointed but found it nicer than expected and my husband congratulated me because it was really a nice surprise to him. The hotel is really modern, chic and nice and full of special touches. The entrance in a back street is a bit strange and at the beginning we were a bit surprised and a bit worried but on the plus side it adds to the feeling of discovery and place reserved to a few and if you do not like to go in from there you can always get in and out through the bar entrance and stop for a drink in your way! The lobby is nice but also a bit strange as it gives you more the feeling of being in a club lounge. The staff was really friendly and check in and out was very smooth. We only had a small problem as we booked a parking space and when we arrived with the car the places were full but they finally found and extra place. The room was big with a very nice modern and minimalistic decor, a comfy bed, great stereo, a domotic system through the phone to control temperature, do not disturb sign, the lights... very nice to change the mood of the room from the bed. As a night snack instead of the classic chocolates they left two gigant chocolate cookies every night that were truly fantastic. The bathroom was also great (especially the huge walk in shower -there is also a big bath tub if you prefere- and the Bulgary amenities) and could be comunicated with the room if wanted. The only minus point was the lack of a view as it faced the back stree and the surronding backs of office buildings a pity in such a nice city but the location of the hotel was very central and handy. Breakfast was included in the room rate but it only included Continental, not the cooked menu options even the price was almost the same. That was a bit of a problem as we where staying 4 nights and the continental selection is of a very good quality (freshly squeezed juice, greek style yoghourt, fresh fruit salad...) but very limited (only bread with butter-marmalede, cereals, fruit salad and pastries but not salty options). When we asket the front desk they say we should negociate it with the breakfast manager and we could finally change at least for a day to have some nice fresh pancakes, but it was a bit annoying. Another plus of the hotel is the set ot restaurants and night clubs attached. Normally we are too tired after a long day out to go out at night but here you have a nice trendy bar just downstairs so it is great four a drink before going to sleep. We where twice in the main bar to check the salsa, and back to school nights, both very animated and fun and we spend a third one in the upstairs lounge that was nice with relaxing music but the atmosphere was a bit strange with to many men waiting for women to arrive and keep then company.

I found the hotel great and by the end of my stay was really sad to leave! This is a small hotel that is part of a sort of complex (I use this word loosely), of bars, restaurants, night club - all of which you can indulge in or not - your decision and the hotel is kept seperate from the facilities. Room: I stayed in room 54 and it was great, plenty of space, good facilities, great bed and internet access was free of charge.Turn down service was very thorough and the cookies each evening are dangerous for the waist line! Towels and linen were devine, one thing I dislike is hotels that use bad versions of these, and it certainly didn't feel like the case here. Without a doubt one of the best rooms I've stayed in while on a business trip. Location: This was my first time in Sydney, so I was unsure of the distances between the tourist attractions and also the different neighbourhoods. So it was a pleasent surprise to find that the hotel was in the perfect spot, just a few minutes walk to Circular Quay, Harbor Bridge, Opera House and add 10/15/20 minutes onto this for Darling Harbor, Oxford St, Darlinghurst. Hotel Facitilties: As I mentioned the hotel has a number of bar's and restaurants that, as a guest you will have access to. I didn't venture in to any of these, mainly because there was much to see outside of the hotel! I did access my room via the Establishment Bar a few times, and although is a beautiful bar to look at with amazing architecture, the whole place felt like a bit of a meat market and just not the kind of bar I woudl hang out in...but if that's you thing then it woudl be perfect! There was also a small work out room which you could access at any time with the your room key. I went a number of times and was always the only person there, they have free weights, treadmill, bike, crosstrainer, swiss balls and soem other bit and peices. If there are any keen runners I was reccomend the route from Circular Quay, past the Opera House followign the water around to the botanical gardens and then cut through there to get back on to Bridge street - such a wonderful route with amazing veiws!

expectations\u201d", "Author": "relucanttraveler", "ReviewID": "UR7177577", "Content": "i'm definitely more likely to book a stay with a boutique hotel vs a major chain. i found the establishment hotel one of the better boutiques i've stayed in. i stayed for 2 nights (thursday and friday) by myself (woman in my early 30s) and then moved to another hotel, blue, for 2 other nights, only because i extended my trip and when i did so, the establishment hotel was already overbooked. here are the pros/cons of the hotel, from my experience: pros: 1. location. the location, which i was somewhat skeptical about, was actually quite convenient and very short and safe walking distance to all the tourist haunts (opera house, harbour bridge, circular quay, shopping, chinatown, botanical gardens) in sydney. 2. rooms. the rooms were surprisingly and pleasantly large, with very nice layout. i stayed on the 3rd floor. the room was large with beautiful wide, dark wood flooring. the bed (i'm assuming it was a queen) was on a platform against one wall. a living area and desk area were also part of the spacious room. the hallway leading to the bathroom was all closets. the bathroom was interesting. split tub and shower, double sinks, and toilet separate as well. the tub had a partition that would either join the bathroom to the rest of the space/living area/bedroom or could be closed to make the bathroom truly a separate space. since i was traveling alone, i left that partition open the entire time, which made the room seem even larger. the phone next to the bed had all sorts of controls on them to change the lighting set-up, room temperature, direct dial to hot sydney restaurants, and all the other good stuff. 3. value. the establishment is a bit pricey for most people, granted. but if you're able and willing to spend around $320 AUS for a room, then this is your place. this included a decently sized room -- maybe twice or more the size of a room in any of the nyc boutique hotels like the hudson, chambers, etc. that also included breakfast, which i only discovered the day i left unfortunately, from anything, it seemed, from their breakfast menu, plus free wired high speed internet in the rooms. they also had a small exercise room with towels and water too. comparing that to the $290 AUS i paid to stay at blue hotel (with $25 AUS for internet access for a 24 hour period and no breakfast), i found the establishment to be a better overall deal and value. 4. food. i thought the food options in the hotel were fab. i didn't get to try sushi e, but did lunch in the bar a few times and got room service, which i found to be good, worth the money, and most importantly, diverse in offering. 5. service. good service, attentive, helpful, etc. they found the random things that i had requested, and were very timely with any requests. professional, helpful, and not at all pretentious. cons: 1. noise. i read about the noise complaints on this site prior to booking my stay. strangely i didn't hear any of the nightclub noise. what i could hear, though, loudly, was the noise from the hallway. the first night i stayed there, some other people were entertaining others in their room, and i could hear people, word for word, when they spoke in the hallway. same goes, unfortunately, for the noise coming from the room next to mine. i could literally hear my next-door neighbour dial his phone, talk to someone on speakerphone, and could hear and understand every single word said. it was kind of creepy, and i'm fortunate that i discovered this only the morning i was leaving. other noise was street noise -- there was some construction going on near the hotel, and that started early each morning. 2. ambiance. i was double-minded about whether to count this as a pro or a con. the establishment bar downstairs facing george street is a very popular place. because i kept forgetting how to get to the hotel entrance, i constantly walked through the bar to get to the elevator that would take me to my room. on the first night, i literally had to wedge myself between people to get through the room. it was that packed. which is fine, but wasn't the best place for a woman, traveling alone, to be able to have a leisurely drink without getting harrassed. the crowd is definitely mixed. friday night i ventured downstairs for a few cocktails and was simultaneously pawed and ignored at the same time. lots of men in suits, straight from the office, but also an eclectic crowd of international-looking peeps as well. hard to put my finger on it. people were dressed up to go out, which was nice in some ways but also hilarious. the things that people wear! i wasn't used to how dressed up people were coming from san francisco, where it's more hipsters in a lot of places vs the low cut, tight, short, party time clothes that most of the women wore. still, not saying this was a complete con, as i felt the rest of the hotel made up for any annoyance this caused. and i guess i was amused by this, which could make it into a pro as well.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe

This time around we were travelling with our 15 month old baby boy and we were a little worried, as in our experience boutique hotels are reluctant to cater for small children (if at all... cots ruin the aesthetic?). This was definitely not the case at Establishment and the staff were exceptional in their personal care for us during our stay (it didn't seem forced like at most hotels). This level of service was consistent throughout all aspects of the hotel. An example of this, was a (hilarious rockstar-like) escort by a helpful security guard through the very busy bar (the longest in Southern Hemisphere) packed with beautiful Sydney-siders to get the lift to the restaurant. Again, once at the Est. restaurant, we were exceptionall treated as well and weren't made to feel like aliens for having our little boy beside us asleep in his buggy despite the calibre of the restaurant/clientele. As for the room; the little extras and the styling were perfect, the stunning sound system and free internet a very welcome addition. We also had the most thorough turn down service we have ever seen, complete with delicious homemade cookies. There were a couple of very minor glitches, the bed seemed a little worse for wear (we woke to find ourselves sinking a little in the middle) and there was some noise from other hotel guests (but this is something we felt was beyond the control of hotel staff).
