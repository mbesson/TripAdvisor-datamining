The cable had been out for a while and there was no cable tv at all during my 5 day stay. The speaker by the pool blasted loud music well past 10 PM. Also, there was no hot water for two days. Motel was located next to a strip club and in a shady part of town. Also was within a ten minute drive of the beach, as opposed to a five minute walk as alluded to. Overall, it was a poor stay but because I had paid up front, there were no refunds so felt I had no alternative.

Keep in mind every single person staying in this hotel walked by all day and all night and it kept my parents up. Next my parents paid for a room with a refrig and microwave didnt get it and when asked for the difference in price we were told we had to collect from hotel. com. My parents room 105 was so disquisting even a employee stated oh I cant believe they stuck you in that room. there are no towel bars at all, the tub has a giant crack along wall which bugs were going in and out of. There was no working lamp and tv clicker and my parents had to wait over 5 hours to get it. There room smelled soooo bad it was almost unbearable. Numerous times during the trip my mom had to go get towels as her room was not cleaned one day and was told the stuff is in the dryer that she would have to wait. Her blinds in her room were so torn they didnt even block ally way that was by there room. We are very basic simple people but go to Walmart and buy towel racks, blinds take some bleach to the air conditioner and take care of the bugs... they could make this a decent room with alittle tlc but the way they handled it was not so good. I am very disappointed in this stay and my mom and dad were very upset with the situation. When asked why they were not getting the room they paid for with the refrig and microwave they said they were sold out but a room with its shade propped was empty three out of the four days with that stuff in it was right next door. Also they advertise continental breakfast it is donuts and coffee with no napkins even. I understand it is a low rate but the room we stayed in while cleaner had no fire alarm and smelled like mold. The air in our room was not working and they said because the blinds dont block the sun well then fix them. We took the cover off the air conditioner and there was so much mold and you could stick your hand out the hole to the outside. This is not okay. My husband had two asthma attacks from the mold which he has not experienced in years. I thought they were coming along with fixing up the place but it seems to be at a stall.

OH MY GOSH!!! i didnt have a phone, no alarm clock, no blow dryer.. NOTHING!! so i went to the front desk and by this time i was beyond mad and i wasnt very nice to the girl and she informed me they do wake up calls and they have a blow dryer to use and you can use their phone when ever you want.... ok after i calmed down it didnt seem so bad i even went and said sorry to the poor girl .. it seemed to be a busy hotel and lots of friendly people we went for a walk and it was actually a nice area.. anyways on the second day we were gone all day to come back to our room not clean, thats ok we didnt mind that night i went to go ask for toilet paper and had to wake the freaking kid up and after 15 mins of trying to get him up he finally got up and was as rude as could be .. like how dare i wake him up!! .. the next day our room still didnt get cleaned so the following day we had to ask the roommaids to clean the room!! that night i had to wait 10 mins for the kid to get of the phone with what sounded to be a buddie and i ask to use the phone , he then says to me uhh we only have one line so make it snappy!!!! WHO SAYS THAT?!?! later on that night i had to go ask him for something once again he was sleeping after a few mins of trying to wake him up i gave up!!

The guy in charge at night (around 11:00 pm) was very rude and even told us that there were no rooms available that night even though we booked online and had the confirmation number. We were joking later of what he said when he gave us the room keys: \"youre all set\".. haha.. all set??. you enter the room and find a big, good for nothing furniture taking up all space in the room and making even hard to walk within the room.. There was not even telephone or any other way to call room service or any other \"service\" if that was there. Not only that, we only could find one power socket to which we had to hook up our laptop. The bathroom door did not lock. A part of the room carpet was damp and the bathroomand had a filthy smell. In the morning the toilet did not flush and the water did not clear. We had to go downstairs to let them know, it was a lady this time who called someone and a guy came to hand us a plunger/pumper whatever, to do our own fixing. That was not the end of it, i went downstairs to my car only to see it covered with dust from construction going on some part of the building. They did not even bother to let us know or tell us to move our car. Workers disoriented the side-view mirrors of the car badly and we were lucky not to have them broken. When we went to the lady in charge that time, she acted like this is a very normal thing that has happened. We wanted to talk to the manager but she said we cannot. and said that she can only give the email address of the manager and not his phone number. We were really frustrated at this point and I asked her that who will be responsible for cleaning our car since they could not take care of it the way they should have? the lady became rude, but pressing on with our complains made her call the manager who talked to us in a way as if these things are so normal to expect in a motel..... wtf? the manager gave a 20 dollar compensation for the trouble.. and expected us to digest the horrible experience as quickly as possible, but we were really looking for the appropriate authority to complain officially.

The receptionist obliged and gave us a key for another room. This was even worse. The door did not close securely - there was a large gap, which was very worrying considering the unsafe area. The new room also smelled very damp, there were stains on the carpet and there were cigarette burns in the quilt cover. Most worrying was that instead of a smoke alarm on the ceiling there was just a large hole with wires hanging out. The bed was rock hard and very uncomfortable.

I called up Frontdesk (using my cellphone ofcourse because they dont have room phones) and asked for toilet paper. They said I'd get it in a moment. After 45 min I again called up to see why they hadn't sent the toilet paper and I was asked to look for the Maid around the corridors. After 20 min a guy came and gave me toilet paper and I could relieve my pressure!! Then I try to take a shower and there is no warm/hot water. Miami was 17 degrees F that day.

The pool was clean but the area around the pool was a little messy. This was not down to the motel as they did clean the pool area but mainly down to fellow guests who failed to clear away their litter. There were no room safes or safety deposit boxes; however you could leave valuables in the hotel safe. I used this and nothing went missing!

Like all USA motels the breakfast was only coffee and doughnuts. There are many eateries within walking distance as well as a supermarket and other shops. So you can get most of your supplies on the doorstep. The motel also has its own restaurant. It looked popular but I did not eat there. A tip for anyone taking a car is to leave it in the car park and take the bus downtown or to the beaches. Busses stop outside the motel and for a flat fare of $2 you can get to the beaches or downtown with ease. You can also buy unlimited travel for $5 dollars a day valid for both busses and metro. It is so much cheaper than paying to park your car. I had a relaxing stay and the helpful staff gave the motel a homely feel.

This motel is located in Little Haiti right by a stripclub. The area itself wasn't too pleasing but there was at least a security guard for the parking lot. The parking lot is very small so make sure you get there early enough to snag one of the spots otherwise you may have to park out in the back - not advisable. The girl who checked us in was less than friendly but at least the check in was swift. There's a little restaurant right outside this motel and the menu looked delightful but we didn't end up eating there - there was an 1 1/2 wait for a table so I'm sure it was good. The room was not very clean but the airconditioning worked and the bed was comfortable and clean enough to sleep in for one night. The bathroom wasn't terribly clean either but again - good enough for a night's stay. The worst/weirdest part of this motel was that our back window was looking out into an abandoned, filthy pool (not Motel Blu's property) with cats all around it.

As the other bad reviews say, don't believe the website! The rooms are disgusting, the locks aren't even deadbolted! Anyway, here is my story... On New Year's Eve, after spending the day in South Beach, we headed back to the motel. Since our flight was to leave at 630am the next morning, we wanted to get some sleep right when we got back. Well, when we got there, our key wouldn't unlock the door! Not only that, but we heard people moving and talking inside...I knocked on the door and no one answered. (probably the hotel manager with a prostitute or something) When going to the lobby to complain, the intoxicated (high/drunk/just out there) dude at the front desk gave me the biggest line of crap. He said we checked out at 4pm earlier that day! I said, now how can I possibly have checked out, if I HAVE THE KEY RIGHT HERE!!! The 'dude' and the parking attendant, only had nametags with their first names, and of course they wouldn't give me the phone number to thier manager or thier info. I called the police, but of course they didn't come...it was New Years Eve. At that point, all I wanted was my stuff back. I asked the 'dude', and he said he had no idea, but it wasn't in the room. So, something was up, VERY SHADY. I kept asking, where is my damn stuff!!??? I pleaded with the parking attendant to help me figure it out. He finally went with me to search...We finally found our suitcases and loose items in a trash bag inside a dirty storage/maintenance closet! What a bunch of [--]! After this, I refused to leave the 2nd floor balcony till the cops arrived...but after calling and calling and waiting and waiting they never showed. Of course, we had to leave for our flight, so we left the hell hole at 4am. I guess that places like this exist all over the place...no surprise there.

We decided on Motel Blu simply because it was amongst the lowest priced options on a couple of online booking engines. We were very heartened by the good reviews and are happy to confirm that this place is indeed a good deal. The people at the reception, security guard and valet (who parks the cars for diners visiting the Red Light eatery, adjacent to the hotel) were all very friendly. Parking is free and there were always sufficient lots (which, I've read, is not the case for motels nearer to South Beach.) The room was one of the nicest we have had for the price we paid. It was different from your run-of-the-mill hotel chain rooms. You can tell some effort was put into coordinating the simple decor. It was of a good size and everything worked well - the TV, the lamps, the air-conditioning unit and all the waterworks. The bathroom even looked quite pretty! The bed was huge for 2 persons and very comfortable. The pool and poolside area were clean and comfortable, and many guests were using the pool throughout our stay. The free WiFi worked very well. Motel Blu is conveniently located on US Hwy 1, making it incredibly easy to head for North Miami, South Beach, Downtown and Key Biscayne. Despite this, it is amazingly quiet inside the room throughout the day. There's a huge supermarket and various fastfood outlets around the motel. Driving north on Hwy 1, you will come across many more supermarkets (Walgreens, KMart, Target) and eateries, including an IHOP (one of the best for quality of food and service.) A minimal breakfast is provided at the motel till 10am but runs out pretty early. The guy at the reception recommended walking to Jim's Diner for great food. We had intended to spend most of our 5 days in Miami at South Beach. But driving north on the US1 to Sunny Isles was so convenient, and Haulover Beach had ample parking lots at US$5 for the day - much cheaper and more convenient than streetside parking at South Beach. The beach and water at Haulover is just as pretty as that on South Beach, if you're looking for a less crowded place to hang out at. The restaurant at Majestic Hotel along Ocean Drive at South Beach has pretty good breakfast at $4.95. The spinach and mushroom omelet is enough to fill you up for a good half a day of lying on the beach. All in all, you're in for a good deal at Motel Blu. We value safety alot and felt very comfortable and at-home at this motel.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cBest Motel Ever\u201d", "Author": "NikkiTheNetherlands", "ReviewID": "UR30944564", "Content": "We had a great time in this Motel!

Also Wendys, Taco bell and various restaurants along Biscayne Ave. I found the red light restaurant next door a bit of a waste of time. They had run out of beer and various dishes when we went. The golden nugget was the Magnum piano bar, along 79 street, 3 minute walk, which served good valued drinks, and held a nice restaurant. Being hetrosexual was not a problem at the magnum which is a gay bar. Everyone is warmly welcomed. For the price we paid this was a good valued, honest motel, who appear to have been criticised in the past. I would go there again. The female receptionist when we checked in was helpful, and Amos was on the desk was excellent when checking out.

Minuses: -- yep - two pillows per room - that's it -- yep - two towels per day (no hand towels, no face clothes -- no phone (but when was the last time I used a room phone in the cell phone age == missing hardware like towel bar -- no clothes hangers Not-sure-abouts? ?? location: anyone who is familiar with mixed use neighborhoods will not be threatened by the location (at the next corner is a Wendy's and a Taco Bell, a block away is a large Grocery Store, and in the streets around the Motel there are a mix of businesses, multi-family and single family homes, churches, and some night spots), but if you are more comfortable with suburbs where businesses are at a distance and people are not walking the streets at night, this might not be the place for you. ?? window shades - yes, they are the old roller type, and then may not stay down or close tightly to the window walls, but if you are traveling without a travel roll of duct tape (not to mention a good multi-tool device with screwdriver, etc) you are asking for trouble anyway. (And this is not a slam at Motel Blu, because I have had to tighten screws and tape shuts items in much fancier places. Hey, things fall apart and don't work, and it is unlikely that a skilled maintainence person is onstaff at midnight no matter how great the lodging.
