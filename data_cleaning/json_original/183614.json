And the guy was no better. 2) We were told immediately to remove any valuables or GPS from our car, because it would be broken into, not that it MIGHT be broken in....that it WOULD BE! 3) The pictures online make the rooms look bigger than microscopic, which is a lie. There was 1 foot between the 2 beds, the floors are tile, and my neck turned red and got itchy within 10 minutes of being there. 4) The AC window unit was busted through the wall and held in place with tape. 5) The rooms are so old that they still use standard keys 6) They serve breakfast in a basement (didnt stay long enough to experience this) 7) The rates are the same as the Holiday Inn 2 blocks away, in a better neighborhood, and with rooms 100 times better. 8) Ever person we mentioned the hotel to for the rest of the weekend made itching gestures and laughed and said they would never stay there. The locals know best!! On a weekend booked solid for a music festival, we were willing to pay 5 times as much NOT to stay at this hotel. It was the worst I have ever seen, and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. I would sooner recommend staying in the $12 indoor parking garage around the corner and sleeping in your car.
