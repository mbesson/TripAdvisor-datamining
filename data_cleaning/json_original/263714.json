We walked to everywhere we wanted to visit within the centre, and there was a metro station five minutes from the hotel for trips further afield. The room was basic but clean. Nothing fantastic - the bathroom and TV were small, and the corridors definitely needed some love. Reception was 24 hours, and very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was basic (croissants, jam) but there was lots of it. Everything was very basic, but they did 'basic' well. The hotel ran evening 'bar crawls' for the under 30s, and I probably wouldn't stay here if travelling with family, but saying this we did see a few families at breakfast.

Do not be misled by its convenient location however.Across La Rambla there were numerous 3 or 4 star hotels in reasonable prices,not much higher that what we paid for Reial Hotel. To begin with,the building was old,the elevator tiny and at the reception desk ,there was an unpleasant smell (fish or smth).The room we were given was terrible and judging by its appearance ,I assume all the rooms were terrible.The bathroom was acceptable and seemed \"clean\" but the room had the basics.4 beds(although we were 3 ) ,a side table, a mirror ... that's it.The walls were dirty and I believe they last painted them in the 90's.There were pipes on the wall,and the glass window was full of prints and had not be cleaned for ages. The service of the hotel was awful.At some point we asked for a glass(there was none in the room) and the answer was \"tommorow!\".Also,there was only one socket in the room high on the wall,and i could not use my hairdryer.The breakfast was basic (coffee,juice,muffins,croisssants).Last but not least ,you could hear anything from the next room.One morning someone was crying,and we could hear her clearly in our room!!It was pretty much an awful experience and it's a shame since Barcelona is so so so beautiful. Finally,I found completely hypocritic the fact that the restaurant /bar of the hotel(situated next to the hotel) was nice.I could even describe it as a trendy place to have a drink.The bar was admittedly very good ,decorated nicely.So it was like they did not care about the hotel but cared a lot about the resaurant because their costumers were not only the guests of the hotel. To sum up,if you want a decent place to stay ,you will regret choosing this hotel.If you don't really care about where you stay ,even if the place is disgusting then go.Don't forget that in La Rambla there are a LOT of nice and average priced hotels.This was not a good value for money!!!", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location and an average hotel!\u201d", "Author": "RachShanHopeScarl", "ReviewID": "UR83906485", "Content": "We stayed at Roma reial Hotel for three nights and really enjoyed the experience. the staff were welcoming and helpful without being over friendly.

I confronted reception in the morning of this, but I was simply advised that they are a 24 hour hotel and it is not possible to prevent this happening!

I booked a double room in Hotel Comercio 5 months ago (Comercio + Reial are one company/owner). When we got to Comercio we were told they had some problems with some of the rooms so they allocated us in Reial. We got a room on 4th floor - 407 and I have to say it was rubbish. I read that Hong Kong hotels have small rooms - they are in fact quite good size; but the one in Roma Reial was really tiny! The bathroom was ok, but they could change that old and mouldy shower curtain. There was a window but with no view! Together with 2 other next door rooms, the windows were looking out to a square 'shaft', covered from the top by a piece of glass so we had no fresh air! And inside that 'shaft' on the walls there were all the drainage and pipes running so every time someone flushed their toilet.. imagine what we were forced to listen to. The room was dark and gloomy and because of a small window and that shaft - you don't even know what is the weather like - sunny? rainy? cloudy? You have to go outside to find out. I asked for another room but they were full... The hotel is very noisy - you can hear all the people talking in the next door rooms, you can hear high heels in the corridors, you can hear each door opening/shutting. If someone comes late to their next door room - you won't have a good night's sleep because they will for sure wake you up. Breakfast - I've had better... It's a continental style, but the 'marmalade' they serve is more of a 'juice soup' than a marmalade. I booked a room in Comercio hotel 5 months earlier and my credit card was charged then. All I got was this rubbish and no one even appologised for placing us in another hotel in a room with no view and fresh air. The staff is very indifferent to their guests - they don't smile, don't say much and do not really care. At least that was my impression. My advice: if you are staying there, ask for a room with a proper window and proper view. Remember that on each floor they have at least 5 rooms with a \u2018shaft\u2019 view...

Here's the deal: The staff are NOT overly friendly, but they do their jobs. The rooms are pretty spacious, and bathrooms are clean - we have HIGH STANDARDS and do not give that statement lightly. Linens were not changed during our 3 nights, but towels were fresh daily. An issue with those towels: we had three guests in our room, to discover there were only two towels. So the next night after our day in Barca, we asked the desk attendant on our way in for a third towel for the morning. He claimed he had no key, no access to any towels, and the cleaning staff would not arrive the next morning until AFTER we needed to leave on a day trip. He was unapologetic and insistent that he could do nothing to help us. The third morning we finally did have enough towels though... Breakfast we did not bother with because the LOCATION IS GREAT! That is the best part - you are steps away from the Liceau metro stop, a few gelato/pastry places, Cafe De L'Opera - great for coffee and choclate churros for breakfast, cheap - and the Boqueria Market. Definitely visit the market, its very authentic, cheap and very satisfying food! The Plaza Reial itself is lined with restaurants and bars, but the crowd is definitely rough. Police are posted there every night after dark, but due to cultural differences things that might be an issue in the States are overlooked - like homeless people, people pushing you to buy their junk or flowers, and a LOT of men making uncomfortable advances and suggestive noises. If you use common sense you are fine, but we enjoyed people-watching from the balcony MUCH more than actually sitting in the plaza. Be sure to get a balcony room. Don't let that info deter your stay because it really was okay, just be aware of the environment going into it. One last thing - while we were there for 3 nights, they somehow managed to open a \"Hotel Roma Reial Restaurant\" next door on the third night.

I wouldnt have lasted a week in the place and was glad to be leaving after 3 days but all in all the hotel wasn't that bad at all.

Having been to Barcelona before I chose the hotel for it's price and location. We initially had problems with heating, which were fixed immediately in one room, and were given a new room due to the second room being so cold. The rooms were clean, the staff very helpful. The standard of rooms does appear to be the luck of the draw, but we were pleased enough with ours. Yes, I did wake up with people comming back late, but I have stayed in far more expensive hotels in Barcelona before and encountered the same, (come on Barcelona is known as a major party city). Breakfast not really worth getting up for, and when they say it finishes at 10.00 they mean it finished at 10.00! However, there are plenty places to eat around you. With cheap flights with Easyjet, staying at this hotel allowed me to introduce Barcelona to my family for a grand total of \u00a387-00 each for two nights, staying extremely centrally. Yes, it would not be my choice for summer months, but I would accept that I would want double glazing, air conditioning and have to pay accordingly. The break was a great success and the hotel more than adequate.", "Date": "December 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield", "Title": "\u201cGreat\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4155237", "Content": "I went to the Roma Reial on a trip with college on 11th Nov until the 16th. After reading some of the reviews i wasn't really looking forward to staying in the hotel. Whilst staying at the hotel we only encountered 1 problem, which had nothing to do with the hotel itself just a pushy tutor from another college. The hotel is pretty basic but i found it to be clean and the staff were very helpful. The rooms were cleaned everyday. i didn't find there to be much noise at the hotel unless people had the patio doors open. But what can people expect anyway as the hotel is set in a busy square just off La Ramblas.
