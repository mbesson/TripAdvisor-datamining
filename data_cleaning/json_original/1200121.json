Low and behold it was ready and they checked me in without delay. The hotel and room were very clean, new and fresh and everyone at the hotel was nicer than the next (I did not find one employee who was not smiling or asking if they could do something for me). The free breakfast was very nice and enjoyable with a good variety and they have a mini-coffee bar (self-serve) set-up 24/7 which is great for a coffee drinker like myself. They include free WiFi - which is not only great but saves some money. Nice plasma TVs in the room. Their work-out room was nice and very modern and had good basic offerings. Their outdoor (heated) pool was great (took a nice swim) as was the whirlpool. Another nice feature is that 1/4 mile behind the hotel is a huge outlet of restaurants, stores and pretty much anything you could want or need.

Some promotional materials located in the business center had expired but were still on display. The exercise room was equipped with free weights and medicine balls in addition to cardio workout machines. There also was a heated outdoor pool and whirlpool available to use.

I gave it an average rating but would give it a 3.5 out of 5 if possible. The front desk staff were all super friendly from the moment we arrived until we left. No lapses of courtesy from the four different people with whom we interacted. The parking area was well lit and is shared with a Homewood Suites next door. Since our visit was during the Christmas holidays there weren't a lot of people in the inn. We had to call down to the front desk and ask for a light bulb to be put in the floor lamp; there wasn't one in it at all when we arrived. The drain in the bath tub is slow so you end up with a tub about 1/4 full of water after a 5 minute shower. We did NOT ask maintenance to fix the slow drain; it was a minor irritant. The king bed slept great and they had a nice assortment of pillows from which to choose. Interestingly enough, it was cold enough in Phoenix to run the heater during our stay and it worked well with a thermostat on the wall. The room was clean and well maintained. All bathroom amenities were available and in ample supply. They use a reuse/replace system for linens which I prefer. If you put bath linens on the floor, they replace them, else you use them again. Housekeeping was very good. We almost always tip the HK staff and did so this time because of the good service. The breakfast was probably the weakest part of the stay. All the juices were watered down. The sausage patties were good but the links were tasteless. The oatmeal was really thick. Never tried the eggs but they looked 'fake'. Waffles and cold cereal were great and all items were well stocked. Although the food wasn't the best we still tipped the kitchen staff because they did a good job with what they had.

The room was very clean and well-appointed with a desk, sleeper couch (which we didn't use), nice TV (with many channels of course), and good bed with quality bedding. Wireless internet (free) worked well, and I noticed but did not use a wired internet connection also in the room. When I brought back some leftovers from dinner and asked them to keep it for me, they even brought a fridge right up to the room for us. Everyone was consistently friendly and helpful. Loads of shops and larger stores are 1/2 block from the hotel. The hotel sits behind two shopping malls. In addition to a wide variety of stores from boutique stores to WalMart, there are numerous fast food and restaurant options, and a movie theatre about 3 blocks away. Everything is walking distance if you are so inclined. I never realized there was so much at this exit off I-17 before. I believe most of it has been built in the last 3 years or so. Al in all for a relaxing night away everything we needed was very close by and convenient. It was nice not to have to fight the traffic to other commercial areas on Bell, etc. Breakfast was, as free hotel breakfasts go, much above average, with omelettes and sausage in addition to the usual fair of bagels, pastries, cereal, and waffles. There was also fruit, and of course juice and coffee. There was also a nice pool and patio area outside where my wife sat and read for awhile, and a fitness center that we both used (and unlike many hotel fitness centers here everything worked and they even had a full set of dumbbells going up into larger weights).
