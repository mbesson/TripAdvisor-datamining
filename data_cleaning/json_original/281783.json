It was a birthday trip for me. We are from St. Louis so it was about a 4 hour drive and a late one for us. We got there and checked in. My husband checked us in while we waited in the car. I can't speak much on the check in process other than he didn't have any complaints! I take that as a good thing. When we got to the room it looked \"cute\". I was pleased that they put a crib/playpen in the room. It was sweet until I when to turn on the light on the side of the bed and it didn't work. Doh! I thought well maybe that was a small issue they needed to fix. We found that the rest of the lights worked fine. When the lights came on I remembered the reviews of \" you get what you pay for.\" I would go a step further and say we got a little less than what we paid for. I've stayed in other hotels for less and it was cleaner! The good: The hotel wasn't hard to find. It has a unique theme, nice sitting area out side by the front. The size of the room fit our family. There is a small fun park right in front of it. Each room had a TV with decent channels. The bad: It has a small fun park right in front of it and one on the side which can be could be a good or bad. When we got there close to midnight the fun park to the side of it still had go carts going. So if you are sensitive to noise beware of that. the hotel needs updates. It wasn't as clean as it could have been. The front of the hotel looks unique but the rest of the rooms look like regular rooms. Wish they had carried theme on through to the rooms located in the back. The ugly: Ok so here are the things that made me never want to book there again, the bed wasn't good. My husband complained about his back hurting the next morning. We actually slept on the top and used a blanket. I saw the pictures of the stains on the mattress of the other review and it scared me off of getting comfortable. The beds in the other room looked ok. The kids didn't complain. I went to make coffee and saw the coffee pot was dirty. Yes dirty with stains I washed off. After rinsing it out and brewing the coffee I discovered there was a hair strand right next to it and another on the other side of the sink. It did not belong to anyone in our family. Yuck! There were two holes in the walls. There was mildew at the top of the shower curtain. The towels had red markings on them. The tub was dirty and the sink had a brown ring around the drain. The flooring wasn't clean and looked rather disgusting and there was a wasp in the kid's bedroom.

The lady at the desk told us at check in that we would not be able to get a crib, that the hotel has recently switched ownership and that the last owner left it in a terrible state and they were in the process of remodeling. Which it does need. Every single staff person that we encountered was super nice and helpful. The so-so room was alright for the price and location. The pool is situated where you can see the strip and the Tracks while swimming but there is a nice little rock wall that surrounds it giving you a feeling of privacy. The pool is 3' across which is perfect for little ones or laps. You can see people on the big slides at White Water from the pool. I thought it was situated very well. We really enjoyed the pool, I only wish it stayed open later. It closed at ten which is just about the time you get out of attractions and want to come back for a nice lap before bed. Bummer. The kids loved the fact that it was a windmill and it was next to a building that has a massive chicken in front of it.

The layout was nice--two bedrooms, separated by the bathroom.

The night staff was wonderful. We got to Branson pretty late due to a flat tire, and when we arrived, we felt like it was a little too late to go do anything. The staff member told us we could get in the pool until their shift ended and they had to clean the pool. He also let my child use the employee restroom when it was obvious that my son might not make it up to our room. He was very friendly. The next evening guy was similarly friendly and helpful. Now, the woman who was running the continental breakfast was atrocious! I'm sure it is one of those things where she has been working there forever, and this has developed in her a deep-seeded hatred for all of humanity. She was a witch. First, we got there thirty minutes before it was supposed to end, they had run out of coffee, there was only one do-nut, gravy, but no biscuits. Two of my younger children wanted the one do-nut. She said, without being prompted, \"What's here is here. Whoever gets it, gets it and that's it.\" I opted not to let either of my children have the do-nut and instead decided to make waffles in the waffle maker. There was a place for waffle mix on the counter, but it wasn't filled. There was a tub on the other side with plastic wrap covering it. I walked over and got a spoon and started to fill up my cups. Apparently, this was too slow of a process for her because she walked over and took my cup out of my hand! She then dipped the cup into the big tub of batter. Batter was everywhere. She handed it back to me without even wiping it off. I got batter all over my pants and had to change when I went back to my room. My other child decided on cereal. Both cereal machines were full, but there was no milk. I asked the lady if there was milk somewhere my kid could have for the cereal. She didn't say anything, but went back into the back, brought out a gallon jug, and slammed it down on the counter, and then walked away. This was good treatment compared to the lady who was behind me. Her waffle got stuck in the waffle maker, and the lady yelled at her about how she didn't leave it in long enough, that she was supposed to wait until it beeped. (There were no instructions posted anywhere on how to use this waffle maker.) The lady then made a big show of having to clean it, banging it against a sink, and sighing continuously as she scrubbed. She was so bad, the next morning I refused to go down for fear of running into her again. Other than this one crazy woman, the stay was delightful. (And really, in the end, she just reminded me of a very cranky, very southern grandmother.) Everyone else was super nice and friendly and the hotel was very comfortable.

The bed was clean and fairly comfortable; but that was about the only positive thing we enjoyed (besides the location). The room smelled like chemical cleaners when we first entered, the carpet was old and stained, the paint was dingy looking, there was no iron, and the door lock to the outside door only worked the first night we entered the room. We had to ask the front desk to have someone come with a key to open the door each time we wanted back in our room. It was not fun waiting out in the cold wind to wait for someone to come open the door to our room. We were told for 4 days that they would fix the lock, but never did. Other neighboring rooms had the same problem with their locks. There were a lot of disgruntled guests during out stay.

We had an excellent stay and found it to be a great bargain. PROS: It was clean and well-kept. The front desk staff and housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful. The pool area was clean and tidy. The breakfast area was clean. It appears to have been remodeled within the past few years, so everything looks fresh. It is within walking distance of Wal-Mart and one of the outlet malls. There are a couple of miniature amusement parks next door with lots of kid-friendly activities. There is a restaurant next door that serves an inexpensive breakfast buffet (about $5 per person as of this review). PRO or CON depending on your preference: The beds are firm and the pillows are soft but thick. CONS: If you keep in mind that this is an economy hotel, then you won't be disappointed. However, if the following things matter to you: There is no staff person on site between 10p-6a. The free continental breakfast is simple (donuts, two cereals, juice, coffee, toast, English muffins, and toaster waffles). The wall units that heat and cool the room are a bit noisy, but no more so than a wall unit at a similar hotel.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Republic, MO", "Title": "\u201cBEWARE of this Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mariemcarr", "ReviewID": "UR71658630", "Content": "When we first checked into the hotel, we were given a room key. After walking to the building the room was in and opening the door, we realized we were given a storage room key. We walked back to the office to get another room. I advised the front desk clerk that I had reserved a smoking room and she said \"your reservation did not request a smoking room\" very rudely. I produced my reservation to prove what I had requested. The room smelled moldy and the tub was dirty. The vents on the air conditioner were broken and very noisy. The air conditioner is located under a table so it is hard to get to. On one of the beds, there was actually blood on the sheets. The internet connection is extremely slow and has been taken over by Branson ads. The listing on the website states that the hotel has movie channels. They have none. The website states they have a spa, but it is actually a home portable spa (that seats 5) but it was even closed/broken. The website states that the office is open 24/7, but it closes at 11 or 12. After returning to the room from going out on the town, I attempted to fill the tub; however, the water was scalding hot - no COLD water was available. I was unable to wash up at all and actually scalded my hand with the water. Since the office was closed, I had to wait until 7 in the morning to tell the front desk. The maintenance worked came to our room and said that this issue \"happens all the time\" and that you had to let the water run for about 15-20 minutes to get cold water because the hot water builds up in the walls. If I had a child with me, they could have gottten third degree burns. When I complained to the front desk the only thing they had to say was \"sorry\".
