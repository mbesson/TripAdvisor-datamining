Located right next to Harrahs casino the valet parking was extremely congested waited out in the street holding up traffic for 10 minutes just trying to get in. Noticed poor upkeep upon entering lobby. Beverages discarded on tables in the lobby, in corners on the ground ( from the clubers). Loud vulgar people sitting at the bar across from check in counter ( I had my 4 yr old and wife with me). Drunk people stumbling around here and there. Elevator was filthy, the one that worked out the four had a mixed drink that was spilled across the buttons and allowed to dry which made the buttons very sticky the elevator floor mat was in dire need of a serious cleaning. Entering our room, we immediately noticed water stains on the desk area, loose and shakey faucet, wobbly shower head, dirty carpet, hair in the bathtub lipstick on the wall in the bathroom. Rooms are extremely thin walled you can hear everything that takes place in the next room and you can everything taking place in the hallways. Room service menu was silly. Seriously nothing to eat after 11. Not even a burger. Hotel is non smoking, so when I wanted to smoke I had to wait for the one elevator to navigate 20+ floors to pick me up from the 9th floor to go downstairs and smoke in the filthy courtyard. Discarded beverages, vomit, spilled drinks all over seating areas etc. 2 hours later I made the journey back down to smoke again and nothing had been cleaned although more trash had accumulated. For the price, the hotel was a joke.

But do not expect the same service and standard as you would get in a W normally. The pros: The hotel is in a safe area. We walked to and from the French Quarter by day and night, there are a lot of people walking around, no worries there. And it only takes a few minutes. Many members of staff were very nice, the breakfast was also fine. The cons: One day our room was not cleaned at all, another day no towels, another day a few towels only. When we informed reception, all they could say was sorry. Not helpful at all. We had to cancel a restaurant reservation one day, no towels for our shower and it took a few calls to finally get them. One day we looked for information from \"whatever whenever\", they gave us a phone number and told us to ring the place ourselves... All we could do was laugh after all that. Hence our advice not to pay big money for this place. One afternoon we were walking pass the bar and lots of take away boxes and glasses were left there from the night before, anybody could have seen it from the street. Cleanliness is obviously an issue, the carpets in the halls and elevators are hoovered...sometimes. Also we could here very clearly the conversation of the people next door. We had to speak low if we did not want them to hear us. So if you are a light sleeper, ask not to be put in an adjoining room. One last thing, the bar area is freezing, bring something to put over your shoulders. So basically, yes you could consider staying there if you get a good deal and lower your expectations. ( By the way, if it is your first stay in New Orleans, like us and you love jazz and blues no doubt you will love it there. There is a lot more to New orleans than Bourbon street. Try Frenchmen street if you want really good music, it is so much better. We loved New Orleans, the people were so friendly and welcoming. They are many beautiful streets. We felt absolutely safe, but of course we did not go to dodgy neighbourhoods. We loved the French quarter, Treme, the Garden District... If you are interested in walking tours, we would recommend Historic New Orleans Tours. Their tours are good value and very interesting.

Upon check in we were warmly greeted by Nikki, who was a delight and made us feel welcome. We were give a choice of a high or low floor room. The room itself was great, very big room with a king bed as well as a sofa. Bathroom big enough, not enormous but certainly adequate. Big TV, Mr Coffee with Starbucks coffee and a well stocked mini bar.

The room was clean, but we had issues with housekeeping \"missing\" us two days running. Both days we arrived back to our room after 5pm or later and our room had not been serviced. We had to call reception to arrange service. We definitely did not leave the DND sign on the door. This was a bit disappointing as after a long day you want to come back and relax a bit before heading out to dinner, having to pop out again while they fix up the room was a bit of a pain. It did give us a chance to have a drink at the lively bar downstairs - great cocktails and friendly service. Location wise, the W is about 5 minutes stroll to the edge of the French Quarter, it is directly over the road from the Shops at Canal Place (Saks Fifth Avenue has tax free shopping for international shoppers - you collect the tax refund at the airport), literally a few steps from the trolley stop and only 5 mins walk to the WW2 Museum.

While adequately clean, its small size, lighting, and flimsy shower curtain is something I would expect in a Hampton Inn, not a groovy W Hotel. * Lounge music is pleasant at first, but after spending a very long work day late into the evening in the conference room and hearing the loop repeat itself a few times, it got to be a bit much. To be fair, I'm sure we could have called to request it be shut off, but we were too engrossed in our work to do so.

The hotel is located in a fairly convenient location and while not in the French Quarter, it is only a few blocks away and one can easily travel there by foot or pedicab. The area around the hotel is fairly generic and a bit of a yawn, but does have some decent restaurants and easy access to cable cars,shopping and sight-seeing. Perhaps the best attribute is that the location allows you to easily escape the craziness of the French Quarter when needed. A nice touch is free cold water bottles and apples in the lobby. The hotel itself does stay fairly true to the W brand - contemporary and modern, generic, almost a bit dated at this point. No nod to the culture or style of New Orleans - this hotel could be found in any mid-size city in the usa. The lobby is rather small and get crowded when groups are checking in and out. The lobby bar and concerierge desk were also small and lost when more than a handful of people gathered in the lobby. The hotel pool is located on the roof and is slightly larger than a spa tub and the pool deck itself it also very, very small. Very crowded with very limited chairs. People were laying on towels on the hot concrete floor for lack of room and seating options. There was a bar set up the first day, none on any other day. There was also no waiter or attendent. Food orders were placed via a phone on the wall and the food was delivered in paper shopping bags hours later, cold and usually with something missing. The rooms were average and a bit shabby and run down. Scuffed walls, stained carpets, mini-fridge oddly placed in room. One day housekeeping did not show up to the room. Calls to the manager assured us that the room would be cleaned by the time we arrived back from dinner. Didn't happen and we had to wait an additional hour for clean towels. Our friends also had a day when housekeeping did not show up until 5pm. We also had issues in booking the rooms directly with the hotel. The original price quoted and confirmed by email was not honored when we called back to confirm the room. The manage told us they did not know who provided the price quote and therefore did not have to honor it. Many hours of phone time did finally help us get the original price but also became a huge headache.

All was well for the first two days, and the Acura car for local trips was a very nice touch. Then it all changed... The jackhammers outside started about 2 a.m. (not the hotel's fault, just part of the fun), then the concierge called - and woke us up - to inquire why we were late for our car reservation (it had been the day before). Housekeeping knocked twice, once very loudly and again waking us up and then weren't there when we opened the door, just the cart. Then maintenance knocked (he was told we had checked out). When we we left for the day we stopped at the desk and told them it was okay to let him do whatever repairs were necessary, although we hadn't noticed anything or called about it, and housekeeping could also make up the room. Upon our return late that evening the room had not been cleaned and things had been moved around (I assume maintenance) and not put back. While the front desk found the request in the computer no answer or solution was suggested and I had to ask to have fresh towels, which they finally brought up. Forgot about fresh coffee supplies though - guess that was my fault. On our final morning housekeeping knocked again - again waking us up. Apparently putting the \"do not disturb\" sign out doesn't really mean anything. It was as if there were two different crews/management working during our stay and was very disappointing for a hotel of this caliber.

The rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable, with bath amenities by Bliss Spa and the most comfortable bed I have slept in, except for my own. The lobby is both inspiring and relaxing at the same time. There are many public areas in which to relax on the main level along with the Whiskey Blue bar, which is the most beautiful bar I have ever seen! At night, the room is lit by candlelight that creates a soothing atmosphere. The Fitness Studio is one of the largest and best equipped that I have seen at a hotel. It receives abundant natural light and is kept very clean. The Fitness Studio is located on the same level as the outdoor pool, which is situated on a landscaped and lovely upper level of the hotel. The pool is great for relaxation and is heated on chilly days, but is so wonderful to get into for a refreshing dip after a day of exploring the charms of New Orleans. The pool is complemented with an array of new, comfortable lounging furniture that is perfect for sunning, napping, reading or catching up on email. The sun deck area also boasts 4 private cabanas that are outfitted with cable TV. If you get hungry or thirsty while in this area, food and beverages may be ordered from Room Service. The lobby has unique and artistic fresh flower arrangements that are changed frequently. The front of the hotel has a lovely, private bamboo garden equipped with couches. Unfortunately, on my most recent visit, I noticed that some of the guests have taken to defacing these beautiful plants with their initials. Coffee on the second floor in the A.M. is complementary to guests. The restaurant is also on the second floor and offers excellent choices for all three meals and great service. Room service is fast and reasonably priced. The offerings are all quite delicious. As this hotel is pet-friendly, the menu even features dinner and treats for Fido or Fifi! The laundry service at this hotel is also excellent. My clothing was returned when promised and it was as clean as if Mom had done it for me. It also was the same size, too - no shrinking! The staff at The W Hotel on Poydras Street is wonderful! They are courteous, informed, helpful, and professional. I have stayed at this hotel for several years and the staff always remembers my name. The front desk is efficient and quickly checks you in. The concierge desk is helpful in all aspects of their duty. The Room Stylists provide excellent service. The Valet service is always on the ball. I especially want to thank Mr. Lawrence L., Mr. Paul R., and Tony (?) for their excellent service and their courtesy. The employees at The W New Orleans are what really put this place over the top!

The staff are extremely friendly and knowlegeable about the city and were immensely helpful to me during my stay.

We were so excited to stay at a W - we travel quite a bit but have never actually stayed at a W and I convinced our group of 5 to try one this time. We got a great rate through AAA that included breakfast and assumed it was some type of breakfast buffet or continental breakfast. When we checked in and inquired about the breakfast, we were told to eat in the restaurant and order whatever we wanted and it would be removed from the bill. Sounded a little too good to be true so, we inquired at the restaurant as well and were told the same thing. So, we ordered a regular breakfast - we weren't greedy - oatmeal and fruit or the egg plate - one item each. The food was so expensive that it came out to about $55 per couple (or room) per day. When we checked out, I noticed the breakfasts were on our bill. When I questioned the man at the front desk, he was incredibly rude and told me that we were only entitled to a $45 credit. I explained that we were not told this in advance and he removed the charges. But, the one from that morning had not shown up yet. He promised to remove the charge and email me the bill. I never received an email. I called and they finally sent an email but the final breakfast was still not removed. I called 3 times before it was cleared up. Very poor service. On top of that, the walls were paper thin. Not only could I hear everything going on in the rooms around me, but I could hear everything outside - and we were 10 floors up. We could hear people on the street just having normal conversations. Housekeeping was atrocious and non-existent. I asked for foam pillows instead of the feather ones. We came home to change for dinner and someone had come into my room and moved my feather pillow over to the lounging chair. And then left. They put no new pillows on the bed - just moved my current ones. Huh? So, I explained at the front desk and was told it would be done right away. When we came home later that night, no new pillows but a message on the phone asking if we got our pillows. I said no and they were finally brought up. We had to ask for our room to be cleaned 3 times. And when it was finally done, housekeeping had not left new toilet paper, bath products or towels. They folded our dirty towels and left them - and the coffee maker had leaked and we had used the towels to clean it up so they left filthy towels. The phone next to the bed didn't work and neither did the Ipod player. There were a couple of bright spots - the common areas - lobby, restaurant, etc - were very nice. Modern and sleek. When we checked in, the front desk woman was very nice (but when we checked out, the man at the front desk was extremely rude - and I swear his name tag said he was a manager). The poor woman in the restaurant was overworked but great. She really tried and was polite and helpful. I believe her name was Annie. We were also very impressed with the concierge, Danny. He was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. He was really the only bright spot in our stay. I truly could not recommend that anyone stay here. Again, we are well traveled and have very reasonable expectations - we often stay in 2 or 3 star hotels so we really don't expect too much - but toilet paper and clean towels are high on the list!!!", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston,TX", "Title": "\u201cParty Time all the Time!\u201d", "Author": "TheGlamorousLife", "ReviewID": "UR128426973", "Content": "We stayed here during the Essence Music Festival for one night because we came in town earlier than planned.

For years I've wanted to stay at a W but when I travel with friends, we can't afford it, and when I travel with my mother, she prefers more traditional hotels. So after a lot of effort, I convinced my mother to stay at the W for a week during a congress that she was attending. Lobby The area is called Living Room and I loved it. With its cool design and awesome music (nothing mainstream) it was an awesome place to hang out. (As much as I loved the music, my mother hated it and thought it was too loud). This is the only place in the hotel here you can get free wifi (I hate that) and it is only for 30 mins. After that, you get logged out and have to start over. Whiskey bar At weekend nights this is a popular place, and all the cool music that I liked gets replaced by annoying dance hits. Rooms We were staying on the 10th floor. The room had a typical hotel size with a spatious sitting area and a soffa. Don't know why people complain about the sizes. I really liked the dark walls and the purple details, my mother hated it. The room comes with a coffe maker (Starbucks coffe), dvd-player and an Iphone dock with speaker. I loved that last part but was disappointed to find out that the speaker was blown out and you could barely hear any sound. The bed was nice but I hate it when I check in a hotel with what obviously is my mother, only to be placed in a room with a king sized bed. I loved the Bliss amenities in the bathroom. Unfortunatelly the rooms have paperthin walls and you can hear everything going on at the neighbours and the hallway. On top of that, the room was overlooking Poydras street and you could hear sirens all the time. One night, the city of New Orleans decided to re-do the asfalt on the street at 12 am!! Housekeeping If they come, the room gets cleaned. The first day we returned to our room at about 6:30 p.m. and found the room undone. We called and were told that it would be fixed right away. 30 minutes later nothing had happened so I went to speak with the reception desk and they said they would send someone right away. Some time later the receptionist called me and said that we were part of some green points program which meant that we get preferred guest points if we don't get the room cleaned daily. My mother had become a Starwood Preferred guest at the check in but nobody had explained the meaning of the points. I explaned that there was a missundertanding and we would never opt for such a deal. At this point what really pissed me off was that, instead of appologizing and fixing the problem right away, 2 receptionists started explaining in a quite unfriendly way that this was all our fault. It seem like they were trained to never admit a fault. Their attitude was very superior and treated you like you were stupid just because you didn't know their chains weird rules and service names. I imagine I must have looked like a mess after spending the day riding an airboat but a hotel receptioninist at a luxery hotel should never treat a guest that way. I remember a couple of years ago, when we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in NYC, at check in the manager wanted to see if our room was OK. To appologize for the 10 minute wait, they gave us two 20USD vouchers for drinks at the lobby bar. There ware no appologies or anything at the W. Eventually the room got cleaned, we got rid of the green points program and were promised that from now on, we would get daily cleaning. Imagine the joy the next day, when we returned to the room in the late afternoon, only to find it unclean. A call to housekeeping - and the green points issue comes up again!!! They finally sent someone and remembered to come every day for the remainder of our stay. I wish that I could say that it worked smoothly for the rest of the days, but I can't. They would forget to restock on bathroom amenities, sometimes we would get only one bath robe, sometimes none. I had to call them once a day to remind them of things they had forgotten to bring. Also, on the first day, the only bath robe in the room had coffe stains on it... Pool It is very small, with a few sun beds. In the morning you can get a place easly. In the afternoon, it is almost impossible. At about 4 p.m., the sun gets hidden behind a really tall skyscraper and from then on, there is only shade in the pool area. You should forget all tanning. The pool is also full with lovebugs and other drowned insects. Other services In the morning you can get free coffe on the second floor. By the valet parking, you can pick up small bottles with cold water. The complimentary Acura drive is really nice, they will take you anywhere in a 6 miles radious, as long as you book in advance. We used the car twice. The first time we got a driver that told is interesting facts about the local area. He was great. The second time we got a another guy who was most interested to drive the next clients in line, who he had met the day before. They were 2 american women that would not shut up and we ended up sharing the car with them, driving them to their destination first. The WiFi is outragiously expensive. For a hotel that pretends to be trendy and modern, free WiFi in all areas must be a given. Over all, this hotel should not be a part of the W family and is extremely overpriced for the service provided. For the same price you can get much better hotels in New Orleans. Here you are paying for a brand but the hotel does not live up to the standard. This would not keep me from staying at a W, but I don't think I will be able to convice my mother to do it. To finish - the remainder of the hotel staff was really friendly.

Perhaps that's why this experience was so disappointing. I noticed huge problems, both with facilities and with the staff. The first night of the stay, the room was so horribly filled with smoke that we had to switch rooms. The sink in the first room was broken (i.e. unusable). The shower in the second room we moved to had such awful water pressure that it barely functioned. Overall, it felt like money had been spent on the public areas of the hotel, but the rooms were in desperate need of renovation. A 24 hour gym is nice but 3 of 5 treadmills were broken. Housekeeping didn't bother to clear room service dishes or replenish the soft drinks and waters in our minibar. The room felt dingy. The front desk staff was probably the biggest staffing problem. I interacted with around 5 different people and didn't see any of them smile. We stopped at the desk last night to ask which direction we should head to get to Morton's for dinner. We were literally greeted with an annoyed, \"Yeah?\" It was unreal. The ONE bright spot in our stay was Paul R., who drove the Acura car service shuttle that the hotel is promoting. I got the sense that he works for the W, not for Acura, so I feel compelled to note here for any management reading this review that Paul was absolutely great. Helpful, friendly, gave great suggestions for dining, was always ready on time... he was the one person who made us feel welcome and was a huge contrast to the rest of the staff. He needs to be promoted to something with more customer interaction/service (the hotel desperately needs him). I will wrap up this review by noting that I travel often (flew almost 100,000 miles last year) and stay in hotels several times a month, so I assure you that I have realistic standards and expectations for hotels at every level of service.

However, this hotel was not even close to the standard I expect from a W. I was initially given a room on the 15th floor, and it had a very strong, toxic paint odor. I called the front desk and informed them of this. The guy who answered wasn't helpful and said that the area had not been painted recently and that the hotel was \"fully commited\" (i.e., booked). I then asked if all guests had actually checked in and noted that the scent was toxic and strong. At this point he went to talk to a manager. When he came back, he stated that perhaps a previous guest caused damaged to the room that necessitated painting. (Also note that this room appeared to be missing a sofa or lounge chair because there was a large empty space where you would expect a sofa.) He then offered a room on the 7th floor. The 7th floor room smelled like cigarette smoke. However, I didn't complain since it was a better alternative than toxic paint fumes and I didn't want to deal with the front desk person that was reluctant to help. A bit later I spoke with another front desk person (a much friendlier person ) on a separate matter, but I asked if our room on the 7th floor was a smoking room. She informed me that the whole building was non-smoking and offered to move me. Since we were only staying there one night, I declined, opting not to continue running around the hotel for a suitable room. Later my husband noted a cigarette burn on the chaise lounge in the room. I am attaching a picture of it. With all the options in New Orleans, I would suggest finding another hotel. The W New Orleans on Poydras Street is RUN DOWN, DARK, and DREARY!!

The lobby, bar, gym and restaurant look nice, but the room was only so so. Several of my colleagues stayed here too (for a work conference nearby) and we had similar experiences. Here are details: * Shower was crazy! The water would fluctuate during the shower between tepid and HOT and no matter how I set the control, it would always end up burning me. Some of my colleagues had same problem with their showers, so it wasn't just one random room. * Not the cleanest room I've stayed in, though not the worst. I took my own hand wipe to the bathroom counter. The room generally seemed like it had seen better days. * Mini bars were unpredictable. Some of us had water bottles available, and others didn't, some had food items available and others didn't. And, it was never restocked for my stay, so I had to remember to buy water bottles each day somewhere else if I didn't want to drink the tap. * The Bliss cosmetics are really nice but they were also erratically restocked. For example, I used the body lotion tube the first day. It was never restocked in my four days there. The shampoo/conditioner I used every day but they restocked the small containers only once, so I ran out my last morning :( * Most other people staying there were there for fun. A lot of coming and going late in the night/early morning and I could hear my neighbors through the walls. Not fun for my work schedule :( * On the plus side, the HD TV was nice, the bed seemed clean with lots of comfy pillows, internet (both wired and wireless) worked well in the room and was reliable, and it's a pretty good location close to casino, other hotels, riverwalk/aquarium, and French Quarter.

We would not even consider sitting on the couch There were obvious stains on the cushions that did not look as if anyone ever tried to remove them. The bathroom was a joke. The walls needed to be wiped down and the wallpaper was peeling from the wall. The sink is so small you would get water all over the counter every time you used it.

I've known this hotel chain by reputation, and by look at least, it was every bit as expected. Relentlessly contemporary, the decor is sophistication veering dangerously close to tacky. Saved a bit by a sense of fun (e.g., the \"Good Morning\" and \"Good Evening\" mats that greet you when you enter the elevators, changed twice daily apparently). From the street, you pass through a glowing white portal with a single Red \"W\" on it, looking suspiciously like a transplant from a sci-fi film. Concierge and check-in as soon as you walk in, excellent and attentive service all around, consistent throughout the stay. The rest of the first level is to the left, where there are two computer terminals (pay to use, probably free to print boarding passes but did not do it here), a bar area, and their Living Room, with multiple seating and table choices. Across from this are the huge doors to the in-house whiskey bar, Whiskey Blue. Did not patronize but on several occasions passing through the side street exit by here, spied a sleek-looking bar. I stayed in a King room. Very spacious room, with chaise and large desk; no vanity but space in the nightstands. Good quality bedsheets and comfortable bed. Gigantic mirror angled against the wall by the bed; it looked awkward but sufficient space to make use of. Most of the room furniture besides the bed need an update; not high quality make. Unlike the garish colors sometimes on display elsewhere in the hotel, this room was subdued, in dark grey, mustard, and white. Bathroom likewise very roomy, lots of counter space, all amenities available, Bliss products, in cool white, black, and grey; tub shower and wobbly fixtures can use an update, also needs a vent. Very quiet in the room. Wifi is a paid-for amenity. They offer free wifi in their Living Room area but that, unfortunately, didn't work during the days I was there. Free coffee offered at their second floor restaurant Zoe in the mornings. The W's location was perfect for me. Although walking to the NOLA convention center is a bit of a hike, its still a very walkable 20 minutes. Likewise, it is less than 10 minutes to walk to the border of the French Quarter, at Canal St. In a quiet area, no clubs or bars nearby with late night crowds. And quiet despite sitting between the famous Mother's restaurant and the Harrah's casino, albeit a side entrance. If you come back late, it will be relatively quiet on the streets; although I never felt unsafe, I didn't linger either. Overall, it was a solid stay, with highlights being the very comfortable bed, excellent location for what I was in town for, and great service. Rating held down by room rates that don't match the overall quality of the room, with no free wifi in their communal area as advertised.

A friend and I stayed here over the long Thanksgiving weekend. While the staff were always friendly, we were very disappointed with most other services offered by the hotel. The rooms weren't cleaned properly, there was oddly no soundproofing between the hallways and the rooms, and in this day and age, it was unpleasantly surprising to be told to pay for wireless internet while staying there as a hotel guest. I know that we should let the good times roll when in NOLA, but I would have expected a hotel like the W to be prepared to deal with the aftermath!

When I arrived, my biggest concern was that the property wasn't as nice as the other W and that the location was inconvenient. Fortunately, my fears were never realized as I had a wonderful time at this property. Check-In was smooth. Even though I had to wait a few minutes due to several guests being present in the lobby, While I waited, I enjoyed some complimentary flavored water and snacks. I was recognized for my Gold status and even though the attendant didnt' inform me of an upgrade, the view of the river was clearly a step up. However, what really was outstanding was when I arrived at my room, the maid asked if I needed any extra water, towels or toiletries completely unprompted. The property's perks overall was exactly what I needed. From the quality of the common spaces where I lounged and people watched to the great service from bartenders at both of their bars, I really enjoyed feeling greeted and treated respectfully. The complimentary coffee bar in the morning was heaven sent, and the Acura service was perfect since I was able to reserve it to get me wherever I needed to go in town without ever any hassle! The only draw back was the pool area where the key card often doesn't work, even for registered guests. On weekdays it was quiet and well maintained. However, on Saturday, I went for an afternoon workout at the gym next to the pool and while the gym was more than adequate, there was a very raucous party going on which included people drinking heavily, diving into the very shallow pool head first and wearing fewer clothes than they should for their age and body type. Nonetheless, it's N'Awlins so I rolled with it but didn't stick around fearing I might be thrown in the pool myself.Still, having used cash + points to stay here and having access to amenities that I used daily, I really felt this was a haven from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon St. and the French Quarter. If I did want to get there quickly though, it was a 10-15 minute walk or just a very quick and cheap cab ride.

I had heard about W Hotels being funky and high-end, so I checked in with great anticipation. The reception gal was very friendly and helpful, and fast. We were early, but they had a room ready for us, so we went directly to the room to drop off our bags. My husband is a Starwood Member but this particular hotel didn't seem to give any of the perks that Starwood members get elsewhere. Entering the room from the hallway was a challenge because the door is angled into the room such that you almost have to step into the bathroom to get around the door - strange and awkward. Just as challenging when leaving the room. Inside, the room smelled fresh and clean. But I immediately noticed that there was no in-room coffee service. OMG - how was I going to start the day without coffee??? This is a serious situation for me, and a definite negative in my books! The windows had wooden louvered shutters rather than curtains. I wanted to see the view, and tried to swing the shutters open, but they have so much furniture in front of them, that I could only open one of the four easily, and had to move lights and the fridge/minibar in order to open the others. Frustrating. Our first night was comfortable, we had to turn off the air conditioning because it blows right at the bed. In the morning Kelly (husband) had to go downstairs and find me coffee!! Thank goodness we were traveling together. The saving grace was that the coffee he found on the second floor was excellent coffee (but doesn't make up for not having it in the room!). We were gone almost the whole day (at a conference) and got back to the room at about 4:45 pm, and housekeeping had still not made it to our room. At this point we didn't want to be disturbed, so put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and went without housekeeping for the day. The next day, we arrived back at our room at about 5pm, and the housekeeping cart was parked outside our door, and our door was ajar. We pushed it open and went in, but no one was there, and although the beds were made, and towels replaced, the empty toilet paper hadn't been filled and there was still trash in the bins, so we assumed they weren't finished. Kelly called to the gal that was in the room across the hall to ask if she was done in our room, and she answered that our room wasn't hers. So Kelly mentioned that the door was open when we got there, and she was quite rude about it not being her problem. When we found the gal who had cleaned our room, she was very apologetic about the door being left open. Although noting was missing from our possessions, it was a bit frustrating. We didn't eat in the hotel, so I can't comment on the food services. The lobby and hallways were always freezing cold, and I found the lobby (where they had the free internet) to be very uncomfortable. Not my style i guess, but there was loud music, and a strong smell of some kind of air freshener (too strong), maybe to cover smoke from the adjacent bar??? I don't know if there was smoking in the bar, but the air had a stale smell behind the sickly air freshener. We paid for internet in the room, but it was a bit slow. When we tried to switch from one computer to another, it wanted a second payment, so we just used one machine in the room. My final comments are regarding the bathroom. It was clean, but in places starting to show wear (pealing seal around the sink etc.). What I didn't like was that the bathtub didn't drain very well so part way through a shower you are standing in about 3 inches of soapy water. The other frustrating thing was that the vanity mirror (the one attached to the wall that gives you a scary enlargement of your face) was stuck in the corner such that, in order to get close enough to do my make-up, I was standing crammed beside the toilet. Bummer! So - overall\u00e2\u20ac\u201dIt wasn't an unpleasant stay, but given the large selection of hotels at that price point in New Orleans, I don't plan to stay there again.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri City, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe staff put the \"w\" in aWesome!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Zenobia_11", "ReviewID": "UR120114383", "Content": "Dedicated to helping their guest enjoy the total hotel experience.

My last visit there, I had stayed in a French Quarter hotel while attending a PMAI convention. It was terrible - unsafe, unfriendly, and unappealing. Trashy people, scary city preying on its visitors. This time, I loved it. True, I stayed away from Bourbon St. But the city was friendly, the folks chatty and accommodating, and architecture (especially in the Warehouse District) well preserved and wonderful. I finally get why people love New Orleans. One of my worries were the spotty reviews on my chosen hotel. I chose the W as a hopefully well designed, slightly up-market, and hopefully convenient venue. On arrival, I was greeted well. I was identified by the computer as Starwood gold member (I had no idea!) and upgraded to a corner room. I asked if it would be quiet and the warm young woman at the desk assured me ti would be. She was right - my room was spacious and quiet. Comfortable. Nothing seemed tired and worn out. Almost everything worked perfectly. I have no complaints. It wasn't a 4 star experience, but I wasn't expecting one. It was comfortable, quiet, safe, and tasteful. I should mention the extremely authentic and all around wonderful restaurant one block north on Poydras called Mother's. Don't miss it. I had my first nights dinner there and then went back for breakfast. I also ate across the street at the much renowned Cafe Amelie - which wasn't worth the money and at several other expensive eateries. I recommend Mother's as the not to be missed restaurant of the bunch. I should also add that I had the overpriced continental room service breakfast at the W. It was completely okay, but cost about twice or more what it should have.

A workout facility is important to me as well and the Gym here was very well equipped with dumbbells, machines, treadmills, bikes and elliptical.

The W was fine. Pretty average, could use some \"attention\" to detail. However, the reason for this review was the service. I stayed at the hotel this past week for a convention. Upon my arrival I was greeted and taken care of by Kevin Chemlam, he was so wonderful. He took my luggage up and expalined where everything was, made suggestions on things to see, and when he knew I needed something, he called the store to make sure they had it prior to me going all that way. He remembered my name, and made sure daily when he saw me that I was taken care of, THAT is service! The help of Paul Reed to get us where we needed to go, he was so sweet and kind, I needed a ride to the store, and so that I wouldn't get lost or turned around, he personally spoke to the taxi driver and made sure they waited for me. Christie Tomalson, took care of all of our needs for reservations and made such wonderful suggestions for dinner!

Parris Hurst couldn't have been more kind during my check in and questions throughout my stay. If I had to base my stay on the hotel itself, I couldn't say that I would come back for a visit and stay there, because the hotel seems old, and superficially \"fixed\" up with art/deco decor. The bathrooms are too tiny, and had no ventilation, and the water from the faucet ran all over the counter while trying to wash my face. The walls/doors are too thin and I could hear everything going on in each room on either side of me, and the shutters were broken. But, if I had to base my decision to come back because of the service, the wonderful people that I had the pleasure of meeting, I would in an instant!

So I usually am pretty loyal, and try to ignore some shortcomings when they come up. However, my three night stay has been horrible at this hotel. First of all, my wife and I came here for a wedding, and decided to make a 3 night stay of the weekend. We thought the W would be a great break for us. We generally like the brand and our experience. We thought being just outside of the French Quarter would be quieter, since we were traveling with a baby. However, this has got to be the Worst W and worse Starwood hotel we have ever stayed at. This is more Hampton Inn, then W, except Hamptons generally have better service! The hotel looks like it was either an office building or a holiday Inn before they put the W lipstick on this hotel - and it's run as if Whatever and Whenever justify's the staff's attitude of apathy. Room/ bathroom construction was sloppy and cheap. The room was tidy, but dirty, redish mold in the bathroom, dirty walls and bathroom floor. The bathroom sink is about 9\" wide, witih a big \"12\" faucet right in the middle so that you can't wash your face without getting water all over the counters. The wireless internet worked sporadically, and we discovered there was no ventilation fan in the bathroom, nor operable windows (isn't that against code)? Needless to say the room would get steamy and muggy after using the shower. The service was an even bigger disapointment. After we checked in, they said they would put us in another king room the next day with a river view. Before going out in the morning, I double checked with the front desk to make sure they were going to do the switch. We packed up and went into town. We came back around 8 hours later to get our new keys, the front desk had no idea what I was tallking about and tried to find another king room for us. We went back to our old room, our stuff was right were we left it. It was late, our baby was upset and decided not to bother to try and get another room that night. By that time it was slim pickings. I told the front desk how frustrated I was that we went through that effort, and they didn't follow through. The front deks apologized, and said they would get back to me to 'set things right' I never heard back. The next morning my wife put the tag on the door for privacy. Between 9-12 AM, housekeeping knocked three times even though the sign was out. My wife explained we had a sleeping baby, and to come back any time after 12. She came back three times before noon, knocking each time, explaining that if she didn't clean, she'd get in trouble, my wife explained each time that we had a sleeping baby, and to please come back at 12. however 12 came, and she never came back. Even when we came back after the wedding the room later that night, the room was as it was left. No cleaning, no nothing. This was also day three, and they hadn't brought back more bottled water since our first night..... The main reason we chose the W, was we thought the Acura shuttle would be great. The first day, it worked like a charm. We got dropped off in the french quarter without a problem and we made our luncheon with time to spare. The driver couldn't have been more friendly. He had two girls of his own, and was so pleasant with our baby. However, the third day when we went down to get shuttled to the wedding, it showed up 15 minutes late, and we missed the first part of the service. The worse part about the hotel was the air circulation. It's stuffy and the air is heavily recycled. Without operating windows, bathroom fans, we found ourself bothered by the stale or muggy air. We definitely won't be back, and have serious doubts about ever trusting the W brand for service and quality rooms. I wish I had picked up on other review, that this was not W standards or quality. I can't believe I wasted three nights and 4 days at this place, and dealing with complete apathy when it came to service.

There seemed to be some sort of altercation or disagreement in the lobby which was diverting the attention of the one staff member at the check-in desk. My party waited nearly 30 minutes before anyone recognized that we were there. My friends checked-in to their room and then I went up to check into mine. I asked if there were any SPG Platinum upgrades and the woman at the desk said my upgrade was free internet and water. I asked for a coffee maker to be delivered and the woman at the desk said she'd send one right up. We went up to \"the best available room\" to settle in. We went to our room and immediately questioned the hotel we were in. The room was not up to the W brand standard and quality. It seemed more like a economy brand than a W. After a few minutes in the room we recognized that the A/C unit was rattling and was not fixable for us. We also began to notice the ice machine hum which was right outside our door. Further, we noticed there were no trash cans in the room when I attempted to throw away something from our flight. There wasn't one in site! We then realized that the bathroom was less than clean. There were toothpaste stains on the mirror, what looked like coffee or dirt stains on the wall, the W water glass mat was half yellow and half white and there was rust on the floor where it seems water pools by the cabinet legs. There was also debris on the toilet. I then noticed there were no towels in our room. Not one towel! The coffee maker I had requested never made it up either. I decided that this was not acceptable, and at 2am now, all we wanted was to get some sleep in our favorite hotel brand. I entered the hallway to the smell of marijuana and quickly went back to the desk and was met with the same less than thrilled woman at the front desk. I recognize she had a long night with the many events that were happening in the lobby but I needed to share our frustration. I explained the problems with the room and the woman at the desk said she could move me but forgot the type of room I had reserved. I said again that I didn't care what type of room we were in as long as it was clean and ready for us. The woman didn't seem surprised with any of the items I pointed out with our room that were unacceptable. She moved us up one floor and we began to re-pack our belongings to move. We arrived our new room and it was much better. This room was still not up to the W brand standard that we've come to expect and enjoy. The lamp shades were askew, the side tables and fridge were askew, the toilet seat was broken and the carpet was stained. Once we decided to go to bed the biggest surprise was in store. Our bed sheet was covered in a brown substance. We aren't sure what this substance was but it flaked off when we started scraping it. The one thing, now past 2am, we wished to do was to sleep. Now we were faced with cleaning the bed before we could sleep in it. The next morning I attempted to hop online. Unfortunately, the \"free platinum internet\", actually all hotel internet, had such weak signals I wasn't able to connect at all in our room. What a disappointing experience for me and my friends. We are here for work and I had suggested rather than staying at the Hilton, where our conference is, that we stay at the W because we love the brand so much. Now I find myself apologizing to my friends and colleagues for having told them to stay here. We've stayed at W's all over the world and this hotel does not live up to the brand. The next day I called to the front desk as I had a \"welcome message\". The gentleman said I needed to go down to the front desk to get it. I also asked for a knife to cut bread that I had in the room and he said he would send one right up. An hour later there was no bread knife delivered. I went to the front desk and asked for the note that was left for me. I was informed there was no note. I let the lady at the desk know that I had received a voice mail saying I had a note at the front desk. She again said I had no note. She then opted to check a different box and saw I did indeed have a note. I again asked for a bread knife. She said she would have it delivered right away. That bread knife never arrived. Our friends who were staying at the W per my recommendation also experienced woes. One friend needed to switch rooms as hers was also dirty. She was given keys to a new room and walked into a couple who were naked on the bed! She went back to the front desk and they said \"oh, we thought your last name was Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not Schmidt\". Ms. Smith was already comfortable in her room. :) She was given a third room which was cleaner but smelled of pot. On our third night we arrived back to our room and it had never been cleaned (and this was at 1030pm). No new towels, no bed made, nothing. Our friends at the W also reported that their room had not been cleaned either. On check out day I received my portfolio under my door. I opened it up and noticed that my room rate of $130 was instead $489! No wonder the hold on my AmEx was nearly $3000. Also, this was a prepaid rate by my business. I shouldn't have been charged for the room. I went down to the desk and inquired about the bill. I was informed my room rate was indeed $489 a night. I explained that I had a prepaid rate of $130 a night. The front desk agent explained that he didn't know why I had to pay for the room now if it was prepaid. The bill was not able to be finalized before I needed to leave for the airport. I was very much looking forward to my stay at the W New Orleans. However, all I looked forward to once there was checking out.

It had this very cool sitting room off the lobby bar that was very private as well as plenty of common area room to stretch out. The rooms were decorated in a similar decor, but when you get the room you know the hotel is an older hotel. It was a little rough around the edges, but it seemed to fit the throw back look. Minor issues: the TP holder fell off the wall and the tub drain was slow. I called the front desk in the morning and they were taken care of when I returned later in the day. I was there for a meeting and the meeting room food was good. I did also eat there for breakfast one morning. The food was OK but I thought the price was way too high. The only issue I had was the internet service was very erratic and slow. You also have to agree to pay per day, but the amount was waived at checkout.

I was living in Birmingham the first couple times I stayed at the W. I've stayed a few times there since moving to New Orleans. One time was in August 2010 when some friends of mine from Maryland came down for their first ever New Orleans visit. It was a wonderful experience with a suite upgrade to the top floor. My last time to stay there was July 29, 2011. Another friend who had never stayed in a W before stayed with me as we wanted to celebrate the end of our summer graduate school classes. This last stay was just ok, especially since my SPG room upgrade was only to a higher floor. The staff is overall friendly. Generally, you are greeted when entering the hotel. At times, the concierge desk friends can be a bit snooty if you're not dressed hiply. I'm more of an outdoors, Chaco, Patagonia, polo shirt guy. The lobby is pretty cool and has been well maintained over the years. The guest rooms are nice but showing age, as many other reviewers have shared. The beds are very comfy. The walls need more color and better artwork. The walls are very thin, and our NOLA night goers are quite loud walking down the hallways. We ordered some chocolate chip cookies and milk for a late night snack. It took quite a while to get them. I told room service two of us would be eating, but they only brought one glass of milk. I asked the lady to bring us another glass and charge it to the room. We never received it. Also, we requested a bag for the ice bucket. The lady who brought it after about 30 min said she had a hard time finding any. I like the pool area and workout facility. The Acura experience is a great idea, but I've never understood why they cannot come back to pick you up. The St. Regis car service does. But, we don't have a St. Regis in NOLA. Hotel parking rates in this city are a bit out of control. I talked with another guest staying there from an Asian country in NOLA for the first time and he said he was disappointed in the room as he had experience much cooler W Hotels other places.

W Hotels are not known for their spacious rooms, but the size of the room certainly didn't put a damper on my stay. It was clean and the decor is minimal, but spectacular. I love the little touches that make this feel like a luxurious room, but in fact is very afordable. I don't have anything bad to say about the hotel or the room I stayed in. The hotel is close to Bourban Street, but far enough to escape the rowdy drunk tourists. The staff was super friendly and went out of their way ot make sure I had what I needed when I needed it. Restaurant and bar awesome. The bathroom was clean, modern, CLEAN (yes I say it again) and the room smelled like a spa. Also, if you know W, you know their beds. Honestly, the only bad thing I can say is that the bed is som comfortable I wanted to stay in bed all day and watch TV. As a matter of fact, I was there over Labor Day weekend and actually stayed in on a night when all my friends went out because I didn't want to leave the bed (very dangerous bed to fall in love with -- you'll never leave your room.) Props to W for keeping up with brand standards. I love this place and will definitely stay their again (although, I hear there is an even better W in NOLA....hmmm, i may cheat next time and go for the better one), but TRUST, this W is awesome.

The staff was very friendly and helpful in suggestions on where to go. The acura driver, I think his name was Paul, was fabulous and really took care of us! As with most W's, they had fresh fruit infused waters upon check in, which was nice upon arrival. The rooms were pretty similar to other W's, and I like the style and the size was decent. The cons: The lobby did not have the \"wow\" factor that most W's have. The pool was very small, and we had to get out there very early to have a seat at one of only about a dozen chairs. Though both of these were not that important to us, since we spent a lot of time out of the hotel. The housekeeping service was really not good at all. When we arrived, the toiletries were half used and the toilet was visibly dirty. When we went out for the day on Sunday, I stopped by the front desk to tell them that we had taken the DND off and would be out for the night so that the room could be cleaned. It was never cleaned at all, so we had no fresh towels for our showers the next morning. Overall, I agree with others on their reviews - it was the most inexpensive W I have stayed at, so worth the value for the money. You may just want to be clear at check in about when you would like your housekeeping service. One of the guys at the door told me that most of their business is bachelor and bachelorette parties, so maybe this W is just catering to that type of group.

We looked at different packages and decided to try out the W New Orleans. Summary: Overall, the staff and the people who work here go above and beyond. They truly care about the guests. The rooms are average to above average. The hotel has a lot of bachelor/bachelorette and birthday parties with people looking to have a good time in NOLA. Finally, the prices are on the expensive side so be weary. Location: The hotel is about 20 - 30 minutes from the airport and located a few blocks from the border of the French Quarter. The hotel is across the street from Harrah's Casino (great for any gambler or even occasional slot player). Mother's Restaurant is nearby, but there are not many stores nearby. The nearest one is a few block walk. The reason I bring this up is if you want a bottle of water (for less than $6 at the hotel rate), you will need to stock up and go to another place. Hotel: The lobby is really nice. There are curtains that are motion sensing and nice colors. The elevators need to be activated by a room key in order to go to your room. The best amenity is the convenience car (Acura) that will drop off (no pick up) in a 6 mile radius. The pool is on the 4th floor, with a bar. It is a scene to be seen. I saw a few families there with children, but the vast majority of people were lounging. The gym is in front of the pool and is indoors. It has some nice exercise equipment. Room: They are average to above average. I had some problems with the key, they get de-magnetized very quickly. However, BEWARE the small $6 small bottles of water around the room. Also, the TV had limited channels. The staff cleaned the rooms decently. Finally room service is 24 hours, but very expensive. There is an added 30% total surcharge (tax, tip, service fees, etc.) to anything ordered. The beds are definitely \"W\" beds. There is also a lounging long chair that can be slept on and used for quick naps.

We had just finished a long day of travel to get to New Orleans, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel too welcomed having to wait so long to get into our room.

After checking in 3 hours late, not a single apology from the hotel, again this is unacceptable. So we get to our room, which has a main bedroom, and then a separate living room. We were excited because we were having friends over that we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen in years. The room itself is a great room, but this particular room in the hotel was the sparsest suite I have ever stayed at a W New Orleans, and I know this because we have stayed in this room before. Decorations missing from the wall, coffee table had no books and no decorations, and the dining room table had 2 missing chairs. How does a hotel let someone walk off with chairs? Chaise lounge had no pillows, so I think that makes it a bench with armrests and not a chaise. I called the front desk to let them know, and they sent the manager to the room. I showed her the missing chairs, and she told me that they would get us two more chairs pillow and decorations, but they never came. So we had a pretty good start to our stay ;-). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end up inviting our friends over because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough sitting area in the room because of the missing chairs.

But this experience was quite unique (sorry for the length). 1 hr after checking into the hotel, I was in the bathroom getting ready for dinner and the door opened. To my surprise (and theirs) a family of four was issued a key to the SAME room. Since I was half dressed at this point, I think this family got a little more than they signed up for. Clearly embarrassed, they apologized and headed back down to the front desk of the hotel for the right room assignment. About 10 minutes later, hotel security came up to check and see if I was correct occupant (really nice British guy) and explained that it was probably a computer glitch. I understand, these things happen. Since I was heading out to dinner and leaving my computer and jewelry in the room, I went downstairs and asked to speak to the manager to ensure this would not be an issue. After 15 minutes, the manager came out of her office, chatted with some friends who were in the lobby and then seemed as if she would return back to her office! The women at the desk signaled her over and I explained what happened with the key mix-up. She interrupted me and said; \"Just get a new key\" with a nasty attitude and then went back in her office. The woman at the front desk was so embarrassed by the behavior of her manager that she issued me a $70 comp for drinks, (which was actually really nice of her). By this time we were running late for dinner and had reserved the hotel car to drop us off. As we go outside to wait for the ride, the driver tells us they doubled booked and there is a party of 8 waiting to be dropped of in the French quarter. At that point, we just hopped in a cab. Since bad things come in triplicate, I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop. I checked out 5 days later only to realize that they made a mistake on the bill and charged me 2X the amount for two days. Again, Ashley at the front desk was great about taking the time to correct this, but it took 45 minutes to sort out and I ended up missing my morning meeting. Within 2 hrs of checking into the hotel, I can honestly say I have had the worst service of any hotel I have ever stayed in at the W New Orleans. I have stayed in W hotels before, this one does not even compare. Pros: The individuals who work at the front desk are great, extremely helpful (ask for Ashley or Lilly- they are awesome). Cons -Safety (always keep the safety latch on your door) -Managers are not very professional -Do not reserve the car if you need to be someplace in a timely manner -Check your bill before you leave the hotel to make sure you are not overcharged -Cleanliness was moderate at best.

We were tired and it was an inconvenience to have to unpack, and pack up the next day - leaving us feeling not quite settled in, and we were glad to finally be able to check in at the W the next day. We had a lovely stay - clean rooms, nice staff, great decor, fantastic location etc. and thought nothing more of our stay until 2 months later when we received a credit card charge for the W New Orleans. The hotel had messed up and booked us in as new guests when we had returned to the hotel after our one night at the hotel next door, and so even though we had already paid for the room, they charged us again as 'walk in' customers. It was a shock to say the least to receive the credit card bill, having not accounted for such a large charge - we had been given no prior notice from the hotel before taking this money which may be a legal issue. After several phone calls and emails, we finally resolved the issue but it took a further week for the money to be transferred back into our account, leaving us short of money, and at a \u00c2\u00a35.00 loss with the exchange rate!

The service is outstandingly bad...staying at this hotel is akin to throwing your money at cheap motel. The worst part is that they never fix the things they mess up on. Let me elaborate, with a list of all the things that have gone wrong during my stays. 1. I am always overcharged. The W has a problem here; my colleagues and I have rarely, if ever, gotten appropriate charges on our bill. They try to tag on mini-bar charges or extra valet dollars. It's happened probably 75% of my stays here. 2. Room service is a sham. You come to the W because Starwood is known for its customer service....not here. I order food, and it gets there with astonishingly slow speed. and it's never the correct order. And then it takes one....two....three calls to get someone to bring up the missing items. 3. The cleanliness is not on par with a top-tier hotel. In my bathroom when I checked in, there was a short, curly black hair lying underneath my water cup on top of the coaster. The carpets are all stained as well as the comforters. 4. The clientele here is sub-standard for a W. I was awoken mid-week by druken revelers who were shouting profanities. The front desk did nothing to alleviate the situation. 5. They can't do a celebration right. For Valentines Day, a surprise was arranged for me by my significant other with the front desk. Needless to say, that never happened. And then they overcharged him for the champagne. This is just a sample of the numerous difficulties I have had.

This was a disappointing experience. Check-in was smooth and the desk clerk was friendly. The parking guys were especially cool - great recommendations for non-touristy jazz joints and could not have been more cordial. The room was okay, but not quite up to par with other W hotels, especially for the price I paid. Location for Mardi Gras was phenomenal! Right at the end of the parade route - so we were literally able to walk up to the floats to get beads and get a little silly. :-p The gym was just okay, it seems like I've been to better W hotel gyms. The restaurant in the hotel wasn't tasty at all. But hey, you're in New Orleans and right across the street from Mother's - shame on you for being overly reliant on the hotel restaurant! :-p Now the bad part. 4 days after check-out, there was an additional $30 charge on my credit card from the W. What was it? Mini-bar. There is no way that housekeeping could have mistook a discarded water bottle or Snickers bar or whatever else was in the minibar in the trash for one of the overpriced snacks from the minibar. I do NOT do hotel minibars and the only thing in the trash were toiletries. Not sure if this was the W being shady or reckless with accounting, but I was quite angry, ESPECIALLY since it had been 4 days after check out this was charged to my credit card. To be completely fair, my friend staying in the room next to mine had no such issue with his stay. Not to sound like an old fogey, but traveling in the age of identity theft is hard enough.

My husband had stayed at another W hotel years ago and it was great. WEll this one seems to still be stuck in the early 2000s. I think the hotel is still betting on its past reputation as being ultra cool to get around some real problems in the here and now. 1) Our room felt icky! I began to realize why and one reason was there is no fan in the bathroom. So all the showers taken give off humidity that ultimately settles in the room. The bathroom toiletries, were cheap and felt so sticky after using them (they used to carry aveda once upon a time) The carpet felt damp, the air felt humid and the sheets on the bed closest to the bathroom felt clammy. My husband found someones boxer shorts under the bed..gross! 2) the overall room looked like it had not been updated since its inception. So things looked like they were wearing out, from the counter in the bath to the lights in the room. 3) Once upon a time W hotel tried to be the hip hotel by offering people the ability to put their ipod on the alarm clocks to play and charge. They were the only hotel that did at the time. Fast forward to 2011 and they still have the same old clocks. None of the new ipods sit on the players, nor charge, as do none of the new i phones. 4) The restaurant service In a word, AWFUL.. We were there on the friday when it was dead for breakfast, and had to wait forever before just finally sitting down ourselves. Went again on the monday, when it was busier and they still made people wait, not just for the table but for breakfast as well. Hello! People are at conferences, which means they are on a schedule and have to be somewhere... They just were soooo slow it was painful. Overall, it was just not a pleasant hotel to relax in, and I was really glad when we left. Its unfortunate because I was looking forward to staying there but it just did not live up to the pictures, it was deceiving.

However, both Friday & Sat nite parades ended right in front of the W hotel and they were very loud until 10pm. Of the few rooms we had (all were on the 9th floor), our room was with a baby so the noise was a factor. Other normal things about the hotel, good & bad: The sinks in all our rooms had awful temperature control! If you used the hot water, it would get extremely hot (steaming) no matter how much of the cold water valve you use. EVen when you shut the hot water off, it took 10-15 long seconds for the steaming hot water to change to cold. This made it very difficult to wash you face for instance. Then when I tried to plug the sink and get a good temperature in the basin to wash, the sink & faucet are arranged where the faucet comes right down in the middle making it had to wash your face over the sink. It was very odd considering the shower/bath temperature control was fine. Another issue was the lack of plastic laundry bags & the noise insulation between rooms. One side of our room was very insulated & we couldn't hear our group next door. But then the other wall facing another room, we could hear easily (maybe b/c of the vent on that side?). Another room part of our group suffered through a noisy bachelor party room next door being very loud late at night. We also used the door tag to not clean our room, but don't know who took the sign off our door on the 3rd day, but it was gone (neither outside nor inside our room) and housekeeping came in. Considering the drunk ppl in New Orleans, the W should have installed a sign on the door to only be changed from the inside. The free coffee in the mornings and the location right across from Mother's Restaurant was a big plus for our group. Front desk & others were friendly & helpful.

I had a bad experience with both a front desk person and a member of the management, so I had decided not to stay there again. But, i booked a last minute trip to New Orleans and the W was cheaper by far, so I decided to try it again. Another reason that I booked was that there seemed to be an abundance of suites available on the date that I booked, which was also the day I was to check in. I thought that maybe, just maybe, with there being so many suites available for rent and my status as a Platinum member of the loyalty program, I might get an upgrade. No such luck. I got an \"upgrade\" to what they call a \"cool\" corner room. If you check in and they tell you that you are in a cool corner room, prepare yourself for a struggle to get your luggage through the tight squeeze of a door. In the cool corner room you have to open the door all the way back until it hits the column behind it to get enough room to roll your suitcase through the door. The dent in the column behind the door where the door handle hits is testament to this problem. If you are just trying to get in the door without luggage, you have to open the door just enough to step into the bathroom and then you can close the door behind you and walk into the room. The other feature that you might imagine is a nice part of the cool corner room is a view. Again, no such luck. The view from my windows was of the windowless side of the Windsor Court hotel next door, so basically I was looking at a brown concrete wall. If I looked all the way down at the end of the view, I could see the roof of Harrah's casino as well as a tiny sliver of the pool at the Windsor Court. The bed, as always, was incredibly comfortable. The next morning after I checked in, I went downstairs to get a newspaper to take with me to breakfast. I remembered that they always had several stacks of newspapers at the end of the front desk, so when I got to the desk I looked over the newspapers and couldn't find The Times-Picayune, the local newspaper. Thinking they might be out, I asked the person at the front desk if they had any more Times-Picayune papers. He said \"No. We don't have the Times-Picayune because we have a billing issue with them.\" I thought this was something that was not necessary to tell a hotel guest. But he did say that they would send someone out to get one for me, but I declined and took a different paper instead. The next morning, when I was going downstairs to get breakfast, I decided I would ask them to go out and get a Times-Picayune for me as LSU had won the Cotton Bowl the night before and the Saints were playing that afternoon and I wanted to read about both. The woman at the front desk told me that if I wanted a Times-Picayune I could walk across the street to the vending box in front of Mother's restaurant. What happened to \"Whatever/Whenever\"??? I also mentioned that there was no Do Not Disturb sign in my room, and was told that they would have someone bring one up. At 4PM, when I still didn't have the DND sign, I called the \"Whatever/Whenever\" line and they brought one up a few minutes later. With that said, I should also say that the bathroom is in need of an update. The wallpaper is peeling back from the wall in a couple of places and there are a couple of places where something has been dropped onto and chipped the tile floor. When I check into a room that is a part of the Starwood Preferred Guest group, I never expect to find peeling wallpaper. I fully expect that the General Manager or someone in her office will write some sort of standard response on here and that is their right. What is my right on this site is to say this: The last time I stayed here, I had a problem getting my starpoints posted, so i e-mailed the address shown on my folio to inquire. When I got no response and still no starpoints, I e-mailed again. After 14 days I sent a letter and it seems that the day it arrived in the mail someone from the management called to tell me that they don't check that e-mail very often. Why print it on the folio if you are not going to check it? And why tell your guests that you don't check it? It seems that the people who work at this hotel put out information that is detrimental to the reputation of the management. That reflects poorly on you, Ms. Thompson. And if your front desk help is going to tell your guests that the reason they cannot get the local paper is a billing issue, be an adult and a professional and get the issue resolved so the many LSU and Saints fans who stay in your hotel can get the newspaper they want and not have to settle for a day-old USA Today or Wall Street Journal. If you are going to be a part of the brand that has a motto of \"Whatever/Whenever\", you need to take that creed to heart and not tell a guest (a Platinum guest) that they should walk across the street to get their newspaper. If you are not going to live up to that creed, you might as well take down the W sign and become a Four Points by Sheraton, but you would still have to update the bathrooms. The problem I have with this hotel is that it has such great potential, and the lack of attention from staff and management make it fall short.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cFriendly service, small dull rooms.\u201d", "Author": "TripGoat", "ReviewID": "UR91979719", "Content": "Stayed here for a wedding over New Years Eve.

Just a few of the things we experienced: It took 15 minutes to check in for EACH of our two suites. The check-in person was very nice but admitted he had no idea what he was doing. I ordered a floral arrangement to be delivered to our suite. It never showed up. I kept calling and going by the front desk, asking what happened to it. They swore it was never delivered. The florist says it has a signed document showing someone on the hotel staff took delivery of the flowers I never received. I realize that staffing on Christmas can be a challenge, but if the hotel can't provide basic services, it either needs to be upfront about that, or simplify its offerings to something it can handle. On Christmas morning we ordered a room service breakfast. We were told it would be delivered in 30 minutes or less. 60 minutes later, no food. We called and were told the kitchen was \"backed up.\" At the 90 minute mark we cancelled the order. We received an apology and were told we'd get a food & beverage credit on our bill. (We didn't.) We were starving after the long room service wait, so we went downstairs to the restaurant. I asked the hostess if there would be a long wait for food and mentioned the room service issue. She said no, we shouldn't have to wait long. We deliberately ordered only soup and sandwiches, figuring those would come out faster. (Soup can normally be dished up by the servers immediately.) 40 minutes later, we had received only drinks. It was clear that some people who were not experienced in serving tables were on duty and NO food was coming out to anyone. The table next to us was even worse off -- their order hadn't been taken and they'd been sitting there for 35 minutes! I complained to the hostess. A few minutes later a competent waitress appeared and managed to get us some food fairly quickly, but I swear if I had not complained I'd still be waiting on that food. Since clearly there was not enough staff working, the hotel would have been smart to offer reduced service on Christmas (i.e., just Continental breakfast through room service, and maybe a Continental breakfast buffet in the restaurant). That way at least we could have gotten some food in a timely fashion. Our billing was totally screwed up at checkout. We had made a large ($1200) deposit on each of our suites, but we were not credited for that on the final bill. The front desk person was very polite and apologetic, and he supposedly fixed it, but I'm still not convinced my credit card will be billed properly. All of the staff at the hotel were very pleasant but unfortunately many of them were either incompetent, inexperienced or poorly trained. Even with the great rate we got on our two suites, it just wasn't worth it, because the hotel problems really had a negative impact on our Christmas. I spent a lot of time that should have been devoted to family functions, instead dealing with issues at the hotel. I should have paid more and stayed elsewhere.

Whenever I travel on business, I try to book the trendiest hotel I can find for government rate. This was my first chance to stay in a W, so I was excited. On my only other trip to New Orleans, I stayed in the Sheraton on Canal St. The hotel's location was superb for me--I prefer to walk everywhere, and this was walking distance to the convention center, Canal St, the French Quarter, and on one of my afternoon runs I was able to see a good chunk of the Garden District. I think it's the best location going in New Orleans, but it is a little bit away from the action of the Quarter. If you're staying for a convention, as I was, you can't go wrong. The lobby is pretty nice, with a cool little outdoor chill-out lounge and a very cool semi-private room next to the lobby bar that's perfect for a small group. The lobby bar was nice and relaxed, open until 11 or 12 most of the nights I was there. There's also a livelier bar around the corner (still in the hotel) that I didn't get a chance to try. Full score for the lobby and bars. The staff deserve special praise--they were universally some of the nicest hotel staff I've ever dealt with. They were universally charming, genuinely friendly, and accommodating to the nth degree. Bonus points for the staff. The rooms, on the other hand, didn't live up to my expectations. Sure, they had very nice linens, a feather bed, and a flat screen. But the room itself was small and poorly laid out, with a trendy but unwelcoming lounge chair in in the corner. The bathroom was large but dated, and there was even a plastic zip-tie holding the shower-head in place. Not the end of the world, but hardly what you'd expect in a place that aims so high. One of the big failures of the room were cockroaches (little ones, but they were there--I killed 3 during my stay) in the bathroom. I expect that roaches are a part of life in the south, but I was still surprised to see them--I didn't have roaches at the Sheraton. Another was the absolutely useless closet. It was small to begin with, then they stuck an ironing board in it, then they put a shelf across it, and under the shelf they mounted both the clothes hanger bar AND a safe. I ended up storing the ironing board behind the minibar for the week. I like hanging clothes, and I appreciate the safe. But the location of the safe meant that I could not use 3/4 of the space in the section of the closet meant to hang clothes. I went down there with one suit, a light jacket, and 4 shirts, and couldn't hang all of them at once! Complete fail on the basics. I was also upset that they charged me $42 for internet for the 4 nights I was there, and that I couldn't get the wired connection to work. Since my company paid, it doesn't really matter, but it's still annoying. To top it off, it was a slow connection. Expensive, slow internet in 2010? Come on. So to sum up: great location, gorgeous lobby, fantastic staff, nice linens....plus cockroaches, cramped, useless closets, expensive and slow internet, and so-so rooms. Would I stay there again? Maybe, but if I could get a room cheaper at the Sheraton I might go back there instead.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Richland Hills, Texas", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, great location\u201d", "Author": "advicebygrege", "ReviewID": "UR85705526", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights in a one king size bedroom.

I will start off by saying that the hotel is in a great location. It is within walking distance to the French Quarter and close to lots of great restaurants in the CBD. It is quiet and the views are quite nice. When we arrived, we were greeted by Kevin, who was as friendly as can be. Check in was prompt. Kevin helped us with our bags up to the room and explained all the features of the room. Neither of our room keys worked, so he went downstairs to get new ones made. The batteries were also dead in the remote for our TV, so he had someone come in to fix that right away. The common areas of the hotel are quite nice. There are plenty of interesting seating areas in the lobby and 2nd floor, and the bar areas were hopping. Concierge was helpful when we needed their help, and other staff members were quick to assist when they saw we needed help and concierge was already on the phone. Our room, however, left much to be desired. Bed was comfortable but bedframe was dusty! The bathroom was nice but shabby, with missing tiles and a paint job that looked like it was done by my 7 year old nephew. Dark paint was splashed all over the white tiles. The carpet in our room looked like it could use a good shampoo. Toilet looked like it could use a good bleaching. Empty tissue box in the bathroom was not refilled on our 2nd day. On our last full day at the hotel, we came back to the room around 5:30pm. The room had not yet been cleaned. We left again about 30 minutes later and requested that our room be refreshed. When we returned that evening, the room had been cleaned but I also found a very gross surprise - a dirty rag left on top of the clothes that I had set out on top of my suitcase! The cleaning staff really needs to step up their game, both in rooms and common areas. Elevator banks should be checked regularly. We had garbage overflowing in the trashcan on our floor for two days, and the next day there was a full coffee mug left out again all day. The room next to ours set their coffee maker out for housekeeping to pick up, which they did, but left behind a handful of red plastic stirrers. Also, the hotel really promotes their Acura car service. We found the car's hours to be very spotty and unavailable when we asked about it. Concierge should set out a schedule so it is clear when the car(s) will be available. Good idea, but not executed well at this W. Not sure if the same problem is found at other Ws.

I actually can't believe that the W New Orleans is a W Hotel. It is so sub-par in relation to what one would expect from a W. Sure, the lobby is sleek & gorgeously appointed, but most of the staff is inept. From being unable to find a package that was sent for us for over an hour (they repeatedly told us it wasn't there; we repeatedly told them it was...and surprise! They finally found it!) to getting an attitude when we asked someone to open a conference room that we had paid for, it was just a disaster. In addition, the room was filthy. Dust and hair EVERYWHERE. I had to pick out the bright red hair of whoever stayed in the room before me with a tissue before taking a shower. We had no cold water (a ploy to get you to buy the in-room Fiji bottle for $6?) and a bobby pin from the previous guests remained on the floor our entire stay. I just never felt that the room was truly clean, even immediately after being serviced. In addition, they truly don't get the whole \"whatever/whenever\" concept, seeing as every day we were told that the free Acura that would drop you off within 6 miles was unavailable. Sometimes it wasn't running until 4pm, sometimes not until 7. No one could give us a straight answer. And, being that the hotel is located in a business district--not exactly the part of town you want to hang out in--using the Acura drop-off perk was something we relied on in lieu of taking a cab. It wasn't terrible...if this wasn't a W and just some boutique hotel, I'd probably be easier on them. But when you come to expect certain things from a certain brand, it's frustrating when the experience doesn't measure up. In a nutshell, the GOOD: -The cabanas by the pool are great, and the lounge chairs are super comfy. The pool is small, but fairly clean and they usually set up a bar when the weather's nice. -The fitness room is wonderful - clean, updated equipment, those wonderful Bliss cooling towels. -The lobby is spacious and funky. -It's quite easy to get a cab and easy to walk to the French Quarter. -The food at Zoe is decent, if you don't feel like venturing out. -The beds are SUPER comfortable. THE BAD: -The service is uneven. Sometimes you get someone great (Darren, the guy they call The Doctor). Other times you get someone snooty or inept or both. -The hotel is clearly a very old building; the plumbing is loud, we didn't have cold water coming out of the faucet, etc. -Cleanliness (or lack thereof) is a major factor. The rooms never felt clean, there was hair leftover from the previous guests, dusts on the desk and bedside tables, etc. -The lack of wifi is so frustrating. The fact that you have to pay $15 for it is simply outdated and it's impossible to get wireless.

I had to put down three towels before showering which, of course, immediately soaked up all the water and were then a sodden mess by the time I was done. There was also zero room around the sink and only a cart with towels so it was a bit frustrating only being able to fit my toothbrush and face scrub by the sink/mirror. Additionally, three tiles came out of the floor in the middle of the bathroom and skittered around the floor every time you accidentally touched that area of the floor. These may not be big things to everyone but possessing a Ritz-Carlton standard, I found them to be terribly irritating. Oh and the pillows seemed to contain about three feathers each and didn't provide any support so those were sort of annoying too. I suppose these are all things I could have complained about or requested a room change over but once I was settled I really didn't feel like moving around and I'm not sure they would have had other rooms anyway b/c they seemed to be quite busy. Speaking of busy, there were often lines at the front desk and there seemed to be a dearth of desk staff which was especially annoying when we had to have our room keys reprogrammed constantly b/c they often stopped working (even when we were super careful to keep them away from our phones, ipods, etc.). The floors are a bit loud at night as this is a trendy hotel so there are lots of party-goers coming in late, slamming doors, talking loudly, etc. This, in my mind, is not a family-friendly hotel and I would definitely not have stayed here if I was traveling with my 10 year old daughter b/c it had too much of a club/party atmosphere. It's definitely for an older and cooler crowd. Now that I've gotten my complaints out of the way, I do think it's important to note that the customer service was exemplary. Our rooms were not ready upon arrival (and we actually arrived about 30 minutes prior to the normal check in time of 3pm) so the woman behind the desk immediately gave us two $30 and $40 vouchers for lunch at Zoe which was very enjoyable. All the other staff was very friendly as we arrived and departed from the hotel and the concierge was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. They even zipped us off in their Acura (part of their Acura experience) to the restaurant we were planning on walking to so that was a nice treat especially since we did not have a reservation for the ride. The bartender we had in the lobby bar was fantastic and made us several cocktails that were not on the drink menu and the other cocktails we sampled were fresh and fantastic (especially the strawberry mojito). The gym was also clean (although four of the cardio machines were not working which was annoying) and the pool looked nice although we didn't get to use it b/c of the constant rain. The pool is quite small, however, with limited chairs so this wouldn't be my first choice if you're looking to lay by the pool with your friends for hours. So, overall I would give this stay a 3.5 out of 5 because the negatives were just annoying enough to color my overall impression of the hotel. Also, if you're mostly interested in French Quarter activities this hotel is a bit out of the way and certainly not as convenient as the W located in the French Quarter so where you plan on spending most of your time is something else to consider. If you are going to stay in this neighborhood I would check out the Lowes across the street. It seemed just as nice but quieter and without the trendy crowds always present at Ws. Do yourself a favor though and be sure to try John Besh's restaurants Domenica, Luke and the American Sector (in the WWII museum) as they are all excellent.

We were allocated a room on the 6th floor. It appeared ok until both daughter and myself noticed stains on the bed covers - they clearly hadn't been changed. I phoned to report this and was told someone would be up to change them. We started unpacking and then I noticed that the safe door was closed so we couldn't use it. Another call and we were told someone would be with us soon to fix it. Half an hour later and still no-one had arrived to rectify either fault and we wanted to go out. Another phone call where we suggested changing rooms but told no we would be sorted soon. Security arrived to look at the safe and discovered he couldn't fix it there and then. I explained we wanted to go out and again suggested we should change rooms - he agreed and he was able to negotiate a room on a higher floor with a much better view, where the beds were clean and the safe worked. So after a shakey start things settled down. No coffee in the room but available on the first floor untill 11am each morning. We visited the first floor bar the first evening which was virtually empty and the barman told us he was 'training' so couldn't do cocktails without direction. He did make a great margarita though. Whiskey Blue was high quality and pricey and so dark I couldn't read the menu - probably too old to go there LOL.

I wouldn't consider myself a world traveler, but have staying in hundreds of hotels throughout my lifetime and this is the first time I had such a bad experience on 1 trip. let me start things off this way: The Good: The W New Orleans lives up to it's counterparts with it's hip atmosphere in arriving to the hotel, it was posh and shiek and we were greeted very warmly by the doorman/porters. They were extremly friendly extremely helpful and kind. this was followed up by a warm smile from the Check-In Staff. All was looking good... The bad: We get to our room and it's a standard double which is what we ordered. As we venture in to the room further, we notice stains on the floor and Q-Tips lying on the floor, and not clean ones that we dropped, they were dirtly looking...We go into the bathroom and there are towels in the sink, not the towls that you use for your face, but a rag looking towel, like the kind they use to wipe down tables in restaurants. It is soaked and sitting right in the sink that we are supposed to brush our teeth and wash our face in. Hey look, I am not one of those types of people that nit pick everything, the Q-tips could have easily fell out when the maid was cleaning up, no harm no foul, but to leave a rag inside the sink smelling like mildew (must have been there for a while) this was unacceptable. We call downstairs to the front desk and kindly inform them of the issue and ask them to send someone up to clean this. Unfortunately, there is no one available to do so at this current time. Are you serious? You can't send someone up to clean up the room that should have been cleaned prior to us checking in? Ok, so they offered to switch rooms for us which sounded like a good idea, so we agreed and started to make our way down again, when they call back and say, \"oops sorry, there are no more rooms\", we answer back and say you just told us that you were going to switch us. \"Yes sir, but now we have no more rooms, we can offer you a complimentry breakfast for the inconvenience\" We agreed and went out on the town. No harm, no foul right? WRONG! The next morning, we are all getting ready to go out and whilst in the shower, the water completely stops working. Not in the begining or end of the shower, but smacked dab in the middle, shampoo in hair and soap all over body... Boom, no water... No sink water, no toilet water and no shower water to wash off all the soap. Are you serious? I call down to the front desk and am greeted by a short snobby, we are working on it. At this point I am frustrated not only from the night before, but now no shower water... I ask to speak to a manager, and am transferred to the \"Manager\" who says the engineers are workign on it and it should be back up shortly. No offer of anything for the inconvenience, no apology. Nothing. We are furious that a Hotel with such a great repuation can have such a lack of customer service and courtesy. We march downstairs and are met with snotty attitudes and another complimentary lunch offer, I mean while we appreciate the offer, is it too much to ask for a hotel that provides clean rooms and running water? Oh and I almost forgot to mention, that maid service is non existant unless you specifially request it... No new towels were placed in our room until we called down to the front desk to request it, there were also no card that some hotels offer to leave on the door requesting maid service and new towels. So we assumed that the rooms were cleaned daily, but not here... Needless to say, the next time we are out in New Orleans, we will NOT be staying at the W on Poydras Street.

Once I had to call the desk at 4pm to ask if our room was going to be attended to, and another day I had to skip housekeeping altogether b/c I decided I wanted to nap at 4:30 instead. They also threw things away that shouldn't have been thrown away (my razor, for example). 3. Food service was lacking. I tried to get breakfast, the restaurant was pretty empty but I wasn't seated for at least 10 minutes while the waitstaff was laughing and chatting in the back - then I was seated without a menu, and after waiting another 15 minutes for a menu and water I finally left. The next morning I ordered room service and only half my breakfast arrived. To make amends, Travis the Concierge promised me a breakfast coupon. It was never delivered to my room as promised. Next time I'll try the Leows across the street.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

I checked in 1st and was given a 2 bedroom. When I questioned the on duty manager I was asked who I booked through (W site). She then said that prepaying does not guarantee room category (not stated on website). No Kings were available. My friends checked in after and had booked through Yahoo. They were told they need to take it up with Yahoo. Ultimately, I was given $100 credit and moved the next night. A very nice gesture but a poor policy. I did contact the general manager by email from home and she stated that she will educate the front desk and upgrade my next stay. Another nice gesture, but I think a hotel in this price range shouldn't hassel guests. As far as the decor and noise level-you either like it or you don't.

I spent 190+ nights in a hotel last year and I don't give compliments lightly either. Typically, I was treated way better in foreign countries or Hawaii than any domestic hotels. I didn't expect too much before I came to NO, so I was little (pleasantly) surprised of my stay at W New Orleans. I haven't been to many W hotels and this was probably my 10th/11th W hotel I have visited so far. I booked one room at this hotel for one night during the Mother's Day weekend. Before my arrival, I indicated to the general manager (Angela) that I would be coming to celebrate my best friend's college graduation. Less than an hour after I sent the email, I received a greeting email from Angela telling me that she's gonna pre-block an upgraded room for me. For those who are not familiar with SPG upgrade policy, hotels are not obligated to provide an upgrade to any platinum members and any suite upgrade is based upon availability upon check-in. The swift response I got from the hotel manager really shows that the hotel is going extra mile to please their most loyal guests. Later that day, I got another email from the concierge (Brandon B.) who asked me a bunch of questions regarding my friend's favorite things and provided me with some excellent restaurant suggestions. On the day of check-in, as promised, we were given a wonderful wow suite at a high floor with river view. We were delighted and rested a bit before heading out for a dinner (reserved by our super nice Concierge Brandon). When we came back from our dinner, someone knocked on our door but we were not expecting anybody. I opened the door and a staff brought us a bottle of champagne, a fruit-plate, and a very cute handmade porcelain container (with lots of purple Kisses - my friend's favorite color) made in Peru (not China!!). The staff kept apologizing because they put this gift basket at the wrong room and they just realized they made a mistake. My friend and I were totally impressed and we really appreciated the gesture. We had a wonderful time in NO and good rest that night (thanks to the wonderful W bed)!

Clean, modern, gracious and attentive staff, and good location (if you like to gamble at the Harrah's casino, right across the street). Two negative experiences on this trip diminished our experience, however. We returned to our room on our second day to find the room cleaned and everthing apparently in order. That night, I noticed that the toiletries that the hotel provided (shampoo, conditioner, body wash) had been taken out of the shower and lined back up on the sink. They were all more than half empty (there were two of us using them). Why would housekeeping do that? Are they trying to save money? And why be so sneaky about it - they didn't just leave them in the shower and not give us new ones, they were deliberately taken out of the shower, dried, and put on the sink to look like new. I called the front desk at that point and asked for more toiletries; they were delivered that night in a gift bag which was a nice touch. Still, it left a bad taste in my mouth. As I mentioned, my husband and I like to gamble. We spent time each day at the Harrah's casino. Anyone who has ever visited a casino knows that you come out smelling like cigarette smoke. On the second day at the hotel, we noticed a post-it note on the mirror in our room, telling us not to smoke in the room or to face a $200 fine. My husband and I do not smoke, and never have. Our clothes and jackets did smell of smoke. This hotel is right across the street from the casino, they must have guests who come from the casino back to their rooms all the time - do we all get this nasty little note? Since we don't smoke, there was no evidence of smoking in our room, no ash trays, cigarette packs, matches etc. Again, rubbed me the wrong way. To sum up, you may have a lovely stay at this hotel; these may have both been the actions of one poorly trained housekeeper.

My mom and I were in New Orleans for a relaxing get-away weekend. We're not fussy travelers, but the W was disappointing on many levels. Before I list my complaints, to be fair, there were some good things: nice bath amenities (although not all were replaced - a hassle I noticed someone else wrote about as well). The bed was comfortable, and there was plenty of hot water for shower/ tub. Unfortunately, for me the downsides dissuade me from returning or recommending this hotel to other travelers. I reserved our double room four months in advance, and when my mom and I arrived, the hotel clerk argued that we had actually reserved a king room (in spite of my reservation print-out which stated otherwise) and seemed annoyed when we protested. She told us that she could prepare a room for us if we were willing to wait a few hours. She took my cell phone number and promised to call when the room was ready. Four or so hours later we headed back to the hotel (they never did call) and we were told our room was ready. We gratefully headed upstairs after checking in. When we got to the room it was a King bed after all. I called down to the front desk to request that we be moved to a double room, as we had reserved, and we were told that none was available. My mom and I wanted to enjoy ourselves, so we decided to forget about it and move on with our weekend. The W did not feature in room coffee makers, an important feature for us, but you can call and have them bring one up. We called, and they said they would send one up straight away. It didn't, but after resting for a few hours we headed out for dinner. When we returned it still wasn't there, so I called again. A few hours later (now about midnight) they did deliver the coffeemaker, and I was glad because I was exhausted and wanted to go to bed! The phone rang a while later as I was drifting off - they were calling to make sure I got the coffee maker. Thanks. Service was very slow - on one day it was after 6pm before our room was made up. The Internet service in room is outrageously expensive - why don't they offer free wi-fi like other good hotels? On Saturday evening, my mother asked the concierge about music recommendations. He told her he \"didn't know much about the music scene.\" Really? In New Orleans? We love this town and will be back again.

Having never been to NoLa before, I was looking forward to the time I was going to spend there--and I really wanted the W to be better. I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon and found everyone from the woman who checked me in, to the guys who helped me with my luggage to be incredibly helpful. On my way out of town, my flight was canceled and I ended up hanging out in the W lobby for about an hour trying to straighten out flights and overnight arrangements. One of the managers who happened to see me, asked about my plight and asked what I had been paying for the room (since it was the weekend before the Superbowl and hotel rooms were going to be hard to come by if I got stranded I was really worried). He told me that, if need be, he would happily extend my rate and find me a room at the hotel. I was so grateful for his offer and told him so--but it turned out I didn't need it. A+ for service. The room I ended up in checking into for the week, however, was small and pretty run down-- a disappointment. I have stayed in a number of W hotels around the country including, NYC (three different properties) and Ft. Lauderdale and had come to expect a certain level of cleanliness but found the W New Orleans to be dowdy and dirty. The bathroom had dark stains on the tile grout right in front of the sink, the paint on the wall behind the toilet was peeling and cracked and the carpet was in need of either a good cleaning or being removed all together and replaced. I was wary of walking around barefoot, so even when I got out of the shower, the first thing I did was put on my socks. Being from NY, I was very happy to have some warmth in the air, but apparently 60-70 degrees is still cold for those who live in the area, so the heat was on in the room all the time (hovering near 75-78 degrees according to the thermostat on the wall)--and no matter what I did I couldn't get it to cool down enough to be comfortable. The second problem I had was with the gym. I went there every day I stayed at the W (since it rained nearly every day) and every time I went, it was 90 degrees in the gym no matter what the thermostat on the wall said. I complained to the front desk twice about the issue but during my entire stay it was never rectified. The only plus to a 90 degree gym--no one else is crazy enough to work out in it--so I had it to myself (even at 7am!). Finally--the restaurant. As is typical in all hotel restaurants--they are expensive, but the W was pretty ridiculous. I had some granola and fruit for breakfast early one morning and it ran me $30. This wouldn't have been so bad if I hadn't had to wait 45 minutes for it--and nearly missed my meeting as a result. It seems there was a conference at the hotel at the time and the W had failed to staff the restaurant with enough waitstaff to handle the influx of people. There was one woman seating folks and one woman serving, clearing and taking orders. To her credit she was courteous and as quick as possible given some really cranky (and quite rude) hotel guests--but it still took a very long time to get a refill on coffee and even the check. The W caters to both business travelers and pleasure travelers but on a Tuesday they should know better than to keep those business travelers waiting. Bad move. If you stay at this property, its cheaper (with better service and real NoLa feel) to go to Mothers right across the street (get the biscuits and the grits!). I didn't make the mistake of eating in the hotel again. I would recommend this hotel to women traveling solo (and for those of you who actually want to get some rest in the Big Easy), though I really hope they update their rooms soon. The location is close enough to the French Quarter that you can walk (during the day) and the W offers free rides over to the area at night (but only until a certain time at night). On the way back to the hotel, I'd recommend a taxi or walking with a male friend since there is a stretch along the casino that can be a little sketchy.

First off, I'm sorry. Sorry to the staff that they had to put up with a bunch of 30 something year old hooligans out for a lurid good time. I'm just kidding, most of us were perfect gentleman. (Not you Vitty) First off, the staff was great! Everyone from the general manager who had a bottle of bubbly waiting for us upon check in to the maid staff who went the extra mile to have our rooms looking immaculate were absolutely great. I would especially like to thank the concierge (African American gentleman with dreadlocks) who was super friendly and amazingly helpful in giving us directions and restaurant suggestions. A lot of reviewers have compared this W to other W's they've stayed in have rated this one to be sub par. I have had the pleasure of staying at 8 different W's around the country on multiple occasions and I think this one was absolutely on par with the rest of them. The room was stylish, roomy, immaculately clean, and had a great view of the city and the river. It's just boring to gone on and on about how great the hotel was so I'm going to sum it up with a pro/con/fun things to do list The pros and fun things to do: -12-!5 minute walk from the French Quarter....trust me this is a good thing because you need to get away from the sensory over load that is the French Quarter. -Across the street from gambling (Harrahs) -Across the street from Mothers (Greasy delicious hangover cure all) -Free Acura driving service if available -Go to Coop's Place for some of the most amazing fried chicken and Jambalaya. -Go to Commander's Palace for some fancy pants dining. (Worth every penny) -Go to Cooter Brown's and watch sports (In the garden district and it has many different types of beers and there is a lot of cool old antebellum houses to see on the trolley ride to and fro) -Go to Mr. B's for the BBQ shrimp and Bloody Mary's -Go to Pat O'Brien's (Take a picture in front of the fountain and drink some girly drinks) -Go to K-Pauls -Go to Nola's The only con that I could come up with is that we wish the hotel bar was open later.

The front desk agent was rather rude to my friend and declined the request.... the kicker was that the only reason my friend had asked for the \"special\" treatment was because she had just overheard the group checking in before us, and a different agent said they would send up complimentary champagne. To further disappoint us upon check-in, they told us that the pool was under renovations, and that we would not be able to go during the length of our stay.

The trademark W vibe was there, but nicely tempered by Southern hospitality and service. My 84-year-old mother was dancing to the music in the elevators and charmed by the attention she got from Don and others in the lobby. Location was perfect -- walking distance to everything if you can walk a couple of blocks (only across a small street to the casino; two blocks to the Riverfront streetcar; a few more blocks to the French Quarter), yet far enough from the really touristy stuff to relax. We did have a few issues with water temperature control in our rooms, but I don't think the solution is to tear down a perfectly good building to erect a sparkling new shrine honoring waste and shallow thinking.

That said, the W on Poydras is good, but not great. The Staff: very courteous (like most people in NOLA) and responsive to requests. OH and they'll print off your boarding pass for you at the reception desk, or if you fill out a little slip with your info, they'll do it ahead of time and stick it under your door, and they took the time to review the seats available on my flight when I wanted to check in and get a different seat.

Worst case, you take a $6 cab ride to the Quarter and start your walking there. I did both depending on the shoes I had on. The hotel itself is currently undergoing some kind of renovation (or at least I think they are...) as I stayed on the 4th floor (Floors 5 through the top require a key card for access on the elevator...I would've preferred to have been on one of those floors, had I known) and portions of the carpet were covered in taped down cardboard. Again, not sure why. The room itself had upgraded features in the bathroom, but it had the original tile on the floor which though classic, look dated. The carpeting in the room also had flicks and spots of discoloration. Nothing that would ruin a vacation, obviously, but it definitely didn't have the 'polished' look that most Ws do. I have to say, unlike some others who raved about the Bliss products in the bathroom, I hated them. As a mater of fact, I can't remember the last time I left the free-bees at the hotel. Why would I want my hair to smell like cirtus peppermint (or something rancid like that?). They were gross, if you like regular shampoo smell, make sure to pack your own. The ROOM: modern bar, huge desk, flat screen tv, chaise and shutter windows which I liked. Though really the BEST feature in the room was the iPod radio. Why this has not become a necessary feature in all hotel chains? I do not know. Anyhow, all in all, I got a great rate through Expedia, for a pretty great W.

W bills themselves as a Luxury Boutique Hotel that prides itself on customer service. I found that there service is unprofessional and negligent. My major complaint: After opening a tab at the hotel bar with a credit card but then charging the drinks to the room, I was double charged and had to spend a significant amount of time on the phone to resolve the issue. Days after the problem was presumably resolved a barrage of charges from the hotel and the bar appeared on both credit cards used during my stay, some dated three days after my checkout... and signed!. After several phone calls over the past few days and still no resolution. I am considering canceling my cards and reporting fraud. Honestly, and not because I am bitter, the W doesn't live up to its claims, its artsy and filled with smiling faces but thats about as far as it goes, there is no service to back it up.

Apparently the bartender used my room to charge her friends drinks and then charged my credit card for my drinks in addition to charging my room for the same amount!!! I then found an additional charge for $86.00 charge two days later. Each time I called to talk with the manager they were unavailable and no one seemed to remember my situation on the 3 separate times I called.

Check-in was smooth and took less than 10 minutes. When I got to the room at first I was very pleased, but then I started noticing quite a bit of wear and tear. For instance, there were scuffs on the walls and the white couch was just flat out dirty. It's also a little annoying how they jam pack the mini-fridge so that you can't anything in there without taking out 10 things. The walls are PAPER thin! I seriously could hear the entire conversation from the room next door. It was so loud it sounded like a guy had a megaphone to our wall as he was speaking. But with all that said you don't really stay at the W expecting a quiet, serene environment so it wasn't the biggest deal in the world. One other gripe is that our room key mysteriously stopped working and it took 15 minutes to get it straightened out at 3:30 in the morning. Another room also had the same problem.

This property does have potential. I noticed that the GM Angela Thompson recently began posting canned responses with some minimal editing on Trip Advisor. While I'm glad they're looking at the reviews, but it is evident they are not addressing the core issues: housekeeping, maintenance, and responsiveness are lacking. If this post receives the typical cut and paste response from the hotel, we'll know that the guest experience is not a priority. The Wow's The bell staff is welcoming and warm and provides a desired experience - reflective of NOLA culture. Lawrence was my last W experience and he may have saved the whole property as he arranged my transport back to the MSY airport with a very friendly, personable, professional feel that made me forget the room I had slept in. The desk staff I interacted with were all smiles and easy going. Reginald and the on duty concierge (caucasian, enthusiastic, personable, bleach blond male) were assets as well when I checked in late). Taking time to say hello, introduce themselves and provide some insights on local restaurants: BBQ The Joint, Mr. B's in the Qtr, Casamento's, Acme Oyster (for the \"experience\"). In general, every time you came and left, the staff took note and said hello or wished you a good time. Thanks guys! \"W\" is known as a chic line and the lobby is a great reflection of that swanky feel - as is the whiskey blue bar. Nice feel, groove and vibe. Kudos to the designers for executing well there. That's where the WOW ends, because then you go to your room. The best way to describe it is WORN-OUT. The rooms are not up to par from a housekeeping standard, much less a quality standard. One detail I noticed in particular is that the bathroom towels did not match, there were 3 different brands: 'W', Cannon, and Pyramid on was the latter 2 were a shade or two off the W which caused you to notice the off white - non W color - maybe they outsource laundry - but this was a detail that most would pick up on and well, enough that I even wrote it down. The bathroom in particular was not clean, there were stains in the tile floor, the bathtub could have used a serious scrub with Comet or bleach. The rooms are on the smallish side - but that is a NOLA characteristic more than a property line due to the historic buildings that are often used. I am not sure that is the case here but plausible. The thin walls - I noticed I could here other rooms doors opening and closing but that was the extent of any disturbbance - pretty normal noise levels. The room carpet was stained in several areas and needs to be replaced. The mini-bar - had a few interesting souvenir items - a W hat, a W bear, a W intimacy kit that had been opened and the important items removed. Housekeeping never replaced that from the previous guests. Yes, I considered changing rooms. I am SPG Platinum - and received a minimal upgrade to Spectacular Room. However, my colleagues who also checked in had rooms that were of the same quality - so little if anything would have been gained unless we moved properties altogether. You shake your head and accept your fate sometimes. Notes: The hotel was not fully booked. Hot water and decent water pressure. Clean towels. Comfortable bed. Friendly staff. Good location, 5-6 block walk to French Qtr or 3-4 block walk to convention center.

I waited on line for over twenty minutes listening to the bickering over the room service charges and lack of service by other guests. This should have triggered me to question the service levels of this hotel. The room was TINY bit larger than my walking closet at home. The bathroom tiles were grimy and dirty, I found globs of hair in the drain. The toilet just barley flushed, and so on. All this I can deal with, because housekeeping was called and engineering was contacted. But I did have to wait over an hour for each to arrive. The front desk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nicole\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amber\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were very nice and useless.

The concierge was not aware of any of the fees associated with the local museum and exhibits near by. It took over 30 minutes to get a phone call returned with in correct information. Where are the drawers to put away my clothes? This hotel stinks if you stay more than two days. I was completely living out of my suitcase. We were super uncomfortable and irritable. My credit cards and wallet were lost on the drive up from Miami. Luckily, I had my DL and debit card, in my pocket the night before. My debit card had authorization in excess of $700 my total bill was $283.00. I was charged and extra night with a higher rate. The deposit was held twice. It was so bad; I left a day earlier, and vowed never to stay here again. The front desk promised 5000 points to my SPG account. Starwood properties are usually the absolute best and I stay there whenever possible. However, New Orleans was a complete disappointment. I am still fighting with my bank to get the deposit back to my account. As a SPG member I feel I should be treated much better than this. The lack of services, better yet, the in difference is what gets me. It was undertones of there are other hotels in New Orleans Mr. Aguila. I just gave up and left. That is my feedback.

It is probably the worst hotel experience of my life. The first room we got stunk like cigarettes, even though they had described it as a non-smoking room. On top of it, the place was dirty. The cushion on the white chaise lounge was upside down - zipper side up - and had all kinds of black/brown spots on it. There were spots on the duvet cover, and the floor. We called downstairs to see about getting another room. They said someone would come up to help us move to another room. The guy took forever to get upstairs, so by the time he got upstairs we were obviously tired of waiting, so we had moved ourselves and our stuff to the elevator bank. i was ready to go downstairs myself to switch the keys but the guy finally got there. The second room smelled just as bad as the first, and had a stained duvet cover as well but since we had already spent an hour waiting to settle into a room, we just figured we'd go with it. Besides, we figured if the room they moved us into smelled just as bad as the first, it must just be that all their rooms smelled like that. The towels don't absorb water, but they do spread lint all over you when you try to dry yourself, which is a lovely touch. Now I was going to take a nap but the people in the next room - sounds like there are about 6 of them - just flipped on the stereo super loud. I called the front desk to see about switching rooms and have now been waiting for a call back for about 20 minutes.

This was an unplanned, last minute booking through Expedia during a trip to the USA and the purpose was to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday. We did in fact book the W French Quarter but there was some confusion during the confirmation over the phone with Expedia. We fully intended to move hotel on arrival, however, having arrived at the W New Orleans we decided immediately to stay. We would agree with previous reviewers that the staff, from the valet parking guys to the check in staff, were extremely friendly. Some hotels of this standard can be a little intimidating but this is simply not the case at the W. Saturday night saw the hotel filled with people dressed up for a big night out at the hotel, but also saw guests in flip flops making their way back from a full day of sunshine and cocktails - again highlighting the relaxed atmosphere at the hotel. We had been concerned about noise from the bar area in the early hours but this simply wasn't a problem. We didn't eat in the hotel at any stage during our stay so can't comment on the food or brasserie area, but both our room and the pool area were great. It would be good to mention that the pool isn't heated however as I wasn't the only guest to get a fright when going for a dip! The only complaint about the pool area is that our room on the 4th floor overlooked the pool and we tried, but failed, to have a siesta in the afternoon on the Saturday as the music was very loud. This didn't seem to be the case on subsequent days so may not have been the norm, The location was perfect for the Mississippi, French Quarter and it is opposite Harrahs, if you fancy a bit of Vegas style casino action, which we did. Easy access to the street cars too, for those who don't wish to walk far. We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a bit of luxury and very friendly service.

We stayed there Jan 16, 2009 until Jan 20, 2009. From this experience, I would say that if the W chain is like this, I will NEVER stay at a W hotel again. Maybe other W hotels are better but I warn you...DO NOT STAY HERE. I paid for a upgraded (spectacular) room but what we got was so shocking and far from spectacular. I was so disappointed bec I had wanted this to be perfect for my husbands birthday. The room was an odd TINY shape and it was filled with chipped and dirty old furniture. There was not even room for me to open the suitcases. I could hear the people on both sides of us and the window was small and covered by slates that you could not even enjoy the view I paid extra for. The bathroom was just as bad. The bathroom must have been no bigger then a 4 ft box. There was a little sink and a disgusting tub and toliet. Words can not discribe how awful this room really was and I did not mention the old condition of the rug and dust in and on everything. I went downstairs and said that I was clausterphobic and that I could hear the people on both sides. I said that I could not stay in there. It took some urging but they changed our room to a more normal square shape and told us the walls are thin so there is nothing they can do about the sounds. The new room gaves us more space and a normal size bathroom but, the larger counter in the bathroom still had a sink that was so small that water splashed everywhere when you tried to wash up and it was chipped and old as well. The walls were bare and the mimi bar was lacking in everything. The first room we were in had completely different items in the mini bar. While we were there they never replaced the missing items or added the things that should have been in there. In the room, there were no dresssers to unpack your things and the furnture in this 2nd room was no better then in the first. The first day we stayed there,housekeeping never bother to come clean the room and I had to call and inquire if there even was housekeeping. Then the safe was broken and they sent someone to fix it but when they could not, they would not replace it even though I asked them too. I did not want to let it ruin this trip I had planned but I just could not believe that this is considered exceptional. It was far far far from exceptional. I have stayed at a 5 star hotel and this I would HONESTLY rank as 2 stars. They did not even have q tips and littlle trinkets we like to find in the bathrooms of nice hotels. On a positive note, I will say that I really utilized the consierge people to make up for the disgusting rooms. Most of them were very nice and helpful. I enjoyed bothering them every 2 seconds for things we wanted or places to go. It made me feel better about the price I had paid for this room. I am certainly going to write a letter of disappointment to the hotel management and starwood. There are gorgeous hotels in NOLA and this is not one of them. I also went and checked out the W hotel French Quater to see if that was better and dare I say the rooms were even smaller and double the price. Do yourself a favor and stay at Harrahs if you want a more modern feel or Windsor Court if you want a real 5 star hotel. Even if I had paid $100 night at this hotel that would have been too much. Honestly, there are nicer cheaper 2 star hotels in NOLA that are in better shape then this place. I am sorry to write such a review but if I had read something like this, I would have never stayed there. There is no way around it...the rooms are small, old, bare, dirty, terrible amenties except for the bliss soaps, and over priced. Good Luck. I am now left with a bad taste in my mouth for W Hotels and that is a real shame. This is a terrible and over priced dingy skank hotel. What a real BUMMER, but on a great note the FOOD in NOLA is heavenly.

However, the New Orleans W is not their best product. Some hotel rooms make you feel like you were the first guest there. Others make you feel like many people were there before you - they have left stains, prints, dust and other things you don't want to think about. The latter is the impression I got from the W New Orleans rooms. I stayed there a year ago and found large stains on an otherwise comfortable couch. This year I found a similar couch with even worse stains, stained carpeting, stained shower curtain and kind of a solid sheet of dust and stains on a large black shiny wall in the bathroom. I do not obsess on doing white glove testing of hotel rooms. You didn't need white gloves to know something is wrong here. I often wonder if the owner or manager of these hotels would really offer visitors to their own homes couch seating with large stains on it...? Also, the public areas are nowhere near as nice as most W hotels. I just wrote a review of the Atlanta W and it was a great place. On the up side...the staff at the N.O. W tries. They helped me out with bringing a sheet to cover up the nasty couch, brought bandaids, and helped me out with an umbrella. The fitness center is large and well equippped. And...the W Bed is truly amazing. I think it is the most comfortable bed that I have ever tried in a hotel. New Orleans has had some very trying times. Other hotels seem to have remodeled but this hotel just seems to be going further downhill.

We chose to stay in a Starwood property since I am a SPG Gold member and stay in their properties often, but I have to say that I agree with many of the reviews on this site and was also disappointed. The level of service one has come to expect from a W hotel simply is not available at this hotel. I also agree the the room interiors needed proper cleaning and significant maintenance to repair stains, scratches, etc. All of our service requests required multiple calls, often requiring us to go down to the reception or concierge in person to get attention. Others in our party experienced similar issues. We arrived at the same time as 4 other family members, and though I had asked for an early check-in, none of our 3 rooms were ready. It was about 2pm, with check-in at 3, but we were told that the rooms would not be ready until at least 4 - 4:30pm. We went for lunch after being assured that \"we''ll call you when your room is ready\", but never received a call. Around 4:30 we came back, and only one of our rooms was ready (ours). Though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room, when we finally entered the room we realized immediately that it had recently been smoked in, and asked for a room change. Of course we had to wait, but at that point it was only for about half an hour. Other problems during the stay revolved (incredibly!) around our mundane request for an in-room coffee maker. This service is available at this W but apparently rarely requested, as rooms do not come with a coffee maker by default and coffee is served in the lobby each morning. Our initial request for a coffee maker on the day we arrive took 3 calls and over 4 hours, and each day afterwards, the housekeeping staff would ignore the used coffee pot and neither clean it and the mugs, nor restock it with more coffee and supplies. The first day, I thought it must be an oversight, called housekeeping about 3 times, and eventually had it serviced. The next day, I actually WROTE A NOTE to the housekeeper asking her to service it. It was ignored. The third morning, I placed the coffee pot and mugs NEXT TO THE SINK in the bathroom with my note, and yet it was still ignored! I believe this is completely unacceptable in a hotel of this category, and I frankly don't want to be washing dishes during my vacation. Though we complained several times during our stay about the slow and inefficient service, management largely ignored our complaints. The one standout in terms of service at this W is the \"Acura Experience\" that is complimentary. The hotel has 2 Acura SUVs that will drop you off anywhere within a 6 mile radius, which was very convenient and run by very helpful and friendly drivers. This was one of the highlights of our stay, as it cut down on our taxi fares and helped us and our family move around town very quickly. Several other family members stayed across the street at the Loews Hotel, which was much better in terms of restaurant options (the breakfast/brunch at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Adelaide is excellent), size of the rooms (huge vs. tiny at the W), and overall service and care for the property.

American Express Platinum Travel tried to get an additional night with the Windsor Court but being a Saturday night, it was full. The travel agent apprehensively suggested the W Hotel, virtually next door. He stressed repeatedly \"it IS a 4 star.\" Upon arrival by car, we kind of had to look for a valet. It took a couple minutes before a young man said \"I'll take care of your car - do you need a bellman?\" Actually, since we were only staying for one night, we didn't. Two bellmen nearly fought over us and insisted to take our one shoulder-slung overnight bag. The bellman kept repeating \"I'll store your bags until your room is ready.\" I thought this odd because AmEx Travel had requested early check-in. Mind you, this was about 1:30 and official check-in was 3pm. Had to wait at the desk until the girl finished with two others, both of whom she told to come back because the rooms were not ready. Instead of a cheerful greeting I would have expected, as I stepped to the desk she said \"help ya?\" while never looking up at me. I handed her my credit card and she entered the info in her computer and then responded \"your room is not ready.\" She then said \"the bellman will store your luggage and we will call you on your cell when your room is ready.\" We left on foot and walked the French Quarter. At a little after 4pm, I received a call that the room was ready. Went back to the hotel and again waited to get my room keys. The girl again said \"help ya?\" without ever looking up. No recognition that I had been there earlier. Our room was on the 18th floor. I suppose they consider the higher floor the upgrade American Express Platinum is supposed to get. (Also Starwood Gold) The room was tiny. It was the adjoining bedroom to a suite. If we had had 5 suitcases, there would have been no place to open them. At first glance it was nicely appointed. On closer look, the lounger had stains and wear. There was lots of dust around the carpet edges. Two outlets in the bathroom didn't work, so it was impossible to blow dry my hair in front of a mirror. No internet access. No telephone books. No way to find the addresses/phone numbers of restaurants to make reservations. Downstairs, the concierge was continually busy. Unlike other TA reviewers, we found the restaurant the positive experience of the hotel. The food was excellent on the small limited menu and the service was also fantastic for us. The gal who waited on us was very cheerful and funny as well as efficient. The next morning, we were eager to check out and go \"next door\" to the Windsor Court. We checked out at 9am! The $129 room rate became $179 due to taxes and overnight parking for the car. For the price and location, I would say the W is a bargain. If I had paid more, I would feel I had been ripped off.

I am partial to Starwood and stay in many Westin and Sheraton properties. I have rarely had a problem with this group. As such, we were surprised at the experience at this place. As indicated in other reviews, the front staff were indicativve of what was to come. Three guys out front (one of whom obviously worked for the hotel) watched us get our suitcases from the cab. \"Watched\" is the wrong word, from ten feet away they must have sensed our presence, because each was full time texting. We were met inside by a friendly young employee who offered to help us with the luggage (and did). We were checked in by another nice young fellow. We asked both of them where we could get food this late (around midnight). The first lad said he knew nothing about the area being new, but Reginald at the front desk highly recommended Pizza Fiesta...a great place for pizza and mexican he said (and noted he ate there several times a week)...yeah sure. He assured us nothing else was open his late. The menu he gave us was for basic pizza without a hint of any mexican. I don't know what his deal was, but he had something to gain by us going there; of that there is ltittle doubt. We declined and ended up wandering over to Harrah's to eat. So off to the room we go, it is tiny, but well appointed. The bathroom was dirty (I mean DIRTY). The chaise lounge was dirty, the room, on closer inspection was run down in general. We called down for pillows...it took two calls. The second call the person answering said that the request was marked as complied with...hmmm. The internet was down. We were assured that it would be fixed shortly...in three days it never worked. We were told, it was available intermitantly, it was on the verge of being fixed and, finally, by the concierge, that it had been down a long tie and was not expected to be up again for days or weeks. I suspect it has been down since October after reading the earier posts. We noted a complete absence of phone books or the standard Where mag etc. There were many little things we were chaffing about (the list is long) and decided to check out that night. We contacted the Whatever people and asked for phone books. We were told that it is Head Office policy not to supply phonebooks!!!! SO, no internet, no phone books.....I told the lady on the phone we were unhappy and planned to leave early. She enquired into what the problems were and assured me that if I gave her a chance she would \"work her magic\" (her words). Never heard from her again (this was on the morning of the second of three days...the other hotels we contacted were full so we were forced to extend the stay). Called the front again the next day and asked for the Marriott number...when asked (again) why were moving hotels, the employee insitsted I should speak to the on duty manager Allison. I toldsour tale of woe and Allison assured us she would correct the account and that she understood why we were upset. She offered to speak to the Sheraton manager if we moved there (and stayed inside the SPG group). We called the Sheraton, explained the problem and they said they would await Allison's call. I called her back and told her to call. THe next day we walked over to the Sheraton and were told the manager never called. The Sheraton manager called W and Allisonn denied she had offered to call...nonetheless they reduced a suite room rate and we had a great stay. Note that all calls out of the hotel were made on my cell as the W hotel phones would not let us dial out. When we checked out, they tried bill for all the attempted calls out until I pointed out they were all made with in about three minutes...not once could I connect to the outside world. So, no internet, no phones, dirty room, unfilled promises, inattentive staff, and so much more. What is not to love. I don't doubt a good stay is possible, but why chance it. It was a gong show.

We called for service twice - the first time the response was immediate. The next problem (bathroom stool) required 3 service requests before someone responded. However, the person who did respond was extremely friendly & efficient. W Hotels are a higher end hotel, and guests should expect a certain level of quality.

Maybe it's New Orleans, maybe it's the clouds of Katrina that still hang over this place like a pallor. Or maybe it is just poor management. It think the latter. As this W is obviously falling on difficult times. Rooms are tired and not well-kept. For rates that approach those of the Windsor Court one would expect a similar level of furnishings. The bathroom verges on the condition of a college dorm. Instead of a proper desk chair my room had a beat up banquet room chair with bent legs. The day lounger was so stained that I dared not touch it for fear of bacterial infections. All in all I spent the night very much feeling the history of a room that has seen a bit too much action over the years. But where the hotel clearly shows its lack of effective management is in the staff. Check-in was fine, efficient and polite. Mostly the complaints center around the food and beverage offerings. I had limited time for lunch so needed to go to the restaurant here. It was empty of customers and staff. Thinking it was closed I went downstairs and was informed that it was actually open...I returned and waited five minutes for a waiter to appear from a closet and seat me in an affected and detached manner as if I had just interrupted a nap. The food was horrible and I regretted being in New Orleans and not having the time to go out for something. All-in-all the experience left me a feeling as if I had just dined at a roadside restaurant in Moldova. After a long day of meetings and a client dinner I stopped into the Whiskey Bar to have a quiet drink alone. The bar was indeed quiet, two other customers. Which perhaps was the reason that the hotel security guys were crowded around the TV screen playing a Wii video game involving bowling, all while shouting and jaunting each other like we might at a neighborhood basketball court. My favorite was that one of them was actually doing this while smoking a cigar. So much for security in the hotel. And so much for quiet. I drank up and left. The Espresso bar was not functioning in the morning. The attendant was not to be bothered with any request for help in this...telling me from her seat with a clearly pained lift of the head, that I should go to the restaurant upstairs. I would imagine that the espresso machine was fine...that she just did not particularly wish to extend herself. I walked two blocks to Starbucks instead.

Having read the reviews on TA, I have to quote other posters when they said they were \"skeptical\" about a particular hotel based on reviews read. I was too, especially with the W ranked 64th on TA. Usually I fly SWA or AA to New Orleans, but this time..a ROAD TRIP with the family was planned. My first concern was my ETA..which I approximated would be some where around 10 am. (yes I drove at night with my family..and my ETA for peace and quiet in the car was midnight). I actually arrived at about 10:30 am...not only did the W let me check in, but they offered choices; riverview..city view, told us what to expect. They also said if we do not like the room or view, just let them know and they'd change our room. Done deal..we stayed on the 8th floor, partial riverview, full view of the pool. No need to change rooms. The room was quiet, and was in a corner cluster of a few rooms. I did not hear our neighbors, or noise from the street below at all. The bathroom was on the smaller side, but nicely decorated, and not overly small. The sink counter top was a bit undersized, but they had an open shelf under the counter which actually gave one more space over all. One thing that another poster said which is both true and important, is that the HOT water temperature is set WAY too hot. Also for those of us who shave over the sink, the faucet is in the way if you want to rinse off your face over the sink. The towels and wash cloths were thick & plentiful, one had a green stain which was clearly visible and should not have been issued out to a guest room. It was an isolated thing, and since they were plentiful, no big deal. The room size is listed at 301 sq feet. The actual functional room space itself is on par with other hotel rooms in the area of Poydras and St. Peters, because it's the bathroom that is smaller. We had two queen beds, and they were very comfortable and clean, as was the room. Service was offered in the evening, which we declined, and of course the next day. The work desk was oversized, in a good way. The flat screen TV was on the wall over the desk. Again, poster have pointed out the location is \"in the way\" if one is working at the desk and others in your room watching the TV, which is true. One solution is to move a bit to the left or right. Another is for the W to relocate the TV about 1 foot higher on the wall. It's current location is symmetrical. The room is very tastefully decorated, and is indeed very New York posh looking, and that's fine with me, even in New Orleans. The shutters on the windows are a nice touch, as is the wine bottle and two glasses hanging on the wall. The wall behind the bed is black, the opposite one white. The rug is a dark brown patterned color, and was clean. The room did have a stocked fridge. The AC was in order and quiet, and worked with precision. One can also adjust the vent of the air flow. The staff was professional and genuinely friendly and concerned about the needs and comforts of the guests. We were offered a comp ride in the hotels Acura to whatever/whenever our local destination of the day was, which we declined but appreciated. The lobby is busy in a good way, and I did not find it, or the music that was piped in, too loud at anytime. Check out was as easy as checking in, with a gracious staff wishing our return. The location of the W New Orleans is excellent too, just a very short walk to Canal Street, where the street car stop is located.

They were pleasant and helpful in a very warm, friendly way. (We have stayed in other hotels where the staff were nice but it seemed a bit forced.)

Common Areas: Most of the common areas are extremely inviting, especially the downstairs which is drenched in light during the daytime. (The hallways upstairs are bit dark for my taste.) The rooftop pool is small but very clean and the cabanas and lounge chairs make it quite glamorous. My only complaint was that the piped-in music around the pool was too loud. We didn't bring exercise clothes since we only stayed one night, but the exercise room (which overlooks the pool) was huge and had tons of cardio and weight machines. Room: Very clean and attractive. My favorite feature was the row of windows (the entire width of the room) with very nice wooden shutters. Since we only stayed one night, we didn't unpack so I didn't really notice what sort of storage there was (other than the closet). The bathroom was pretty small with a tiny sink and very plain tub, but there was plenty of counter space. I found the bed too hard but my husband slept well. We did not like the king-sized pillows. (Had we been staying more than one night, we would have asked to have them replaced with standard pillows.) My main reason for not giving the hotel five stars is that I found the bed uncomfortable. Location: Good, central location.

I arrived about 4 pm on a Saturday. I found the lobby to be annoying. There was music blaring like a bar. This seemed to be standard procedure starting in the afternoon. It was very hard to communicate with the desk clerks and concierge. There were unattractive decorative vases filled with clear gel with various items floating in them. They seemed nasty and weren't visually appealing. Be aware that on each floor in the corners there are doors to 4 rooms clustered together. There are also doors that lead straight off the hallway into the rooms. I don't know if the ones in the corners are classified differently than others but they seemed to be less desirable. The entrance into the room was at an odd angle and the entrance into the bathroom was at an odd angle. The bathroom was much smaller than you would expect at a hotel of the class. The bath fixtures were nothing special and hard to operate... leading to scalding. There was a very cheap clear vinyl liner. There was nothing luxurious about it. They did offer BLISS products and that was the highlight of the room. My room was on the 8th floor facing the river. On the first night which was Saturday, I kept hearing car horns honking on a pretty regular basis (at around 11pm - midnight). Finally I figured out there was a parking garage adjacent to hotel and the valets were honking as they moved the cars. This garage served the casino nearby.. so there was plenty of honking. So a floor lower than the 8th would be worse. In the evening, they light candles in the lobby and spray fragrance. That seemed \"cheap and cheesy\". They do have a car that provides a drop off service which is very nice. The coffee they serve in the lobby and that they provide in the rooms is a disgrace for a city known for its fine coffee. Also, I when to the restaurant one morning to buy a standard sized carton of yogurt ... I was obliged, along with a bill for $6.95. Come on. Maybe for room service...maybe....

This was our first experience at a W and it will surely not be our last. The customer service was excellent and the common areas of the hotel were relaxing and cool. The room was okay in size (not too big, not too small) and was decorated very modernesque. We were situated on the top floor with a nice view of all New Orleans and the French Quarter. There were only a few things that I did not like about the room: 1. The bathroom sink -- while trendy and fun -- was way two small for both my husband and I. 2. There were no dressers in the room. Yes, there was a nice closet and two nightstands with drawers but I typically use a dresser when I check-in so this was odd. I also hated that valet parking cost us $33 per night. That was very expensive but then again all the hotels in the area were right around this price, so come prepared. Now to the things that I did like: 1. The lobby was a buzz with very cool chic people all over. 2. The room was quiet (I did not hear a peep, like some who have written reviews on here). 3. The bed was comfortable. 4. I liked the location we stayed at. Great access to walk to the French Quarter, Magazine Street, Canal, the Riiverwalk and the Harrah's Casino which was right out the back door. Some may say that it lacks the New Orleans charm and I absolutely agree. This is a hotel that could be located anyplace but then again it was a nice retreat from a night on the town. I will admit that we did try to stay at the W in the French Quarter but it was sold out for the dates that we stayed. 5. The W pays attention to the tiny details. An example is that when you leave at night and are in the elevator there is a floor rug that says \"Good Evening\" and in the morning it has been changed to say \"Good Morning.\" Would I stay there again...the answer is YES!

Based on the time spent there over the week, I probably never will again. The concerns/issues/annoyances started immediately upon arrival where the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greeters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, all five of them, proceeded to watch my wife and I lift a couple very large suitcases out of the car and then into the hotel. The managed to say hi quite effectively, thus my designation of them as greeters, but they never offered to help or handle the luggage and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open the door. Keep in mind, there were five of them and we were the only guests that were around at the time. At check in I was informed of a surprise where (b/c I had made two reservations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one for Monday-Wednesday and on for Wednesday-Sunday due to travel changes) I would have to check out on Wednesday and re-check in. This is odd b/c when I actually set up the second reservation I asked SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) whether I should just cancel my old reservation and put in a new one, they said no b/c the hotels automatically merge reservations like this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6apparently this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true. Keep in mind, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal at all, but just one of those little annoyances that seem to stick out when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re under impressed with your overall experience. Yes, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being high maintenance, but at those prices shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I be? The room was small, but nicely appointed with an LCD tv (maybe 27 inches) and modern colors (very dark reds/maroons and black). The view wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything to write home about and the shutters for someone under six foot could be difficult to open. The shower/bathroom was very nice and the soaps/shampoos were also very nice. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and when compared to Sheraton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sweet Sleeper and the Westin Heavenly Bed I was very, very disappointed. There are some significant limitations to the layout b/c the tv is mounted just above the desk where the internet port is located. Thus if someone is using their laptop their head will block the tv. In addition, there is no wireless internet (I thought this place was supposed to be modern and hip) and the port only stretched a few inches forcing me to use the extended Ethernet cord I always carry. Not a big issue for me b/c I travel a lot and always carry one, but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one, the entire experience will be uncomfortable for everyone involved. 24 hours of access was $14.95, which is a rip-off, but standard in most hotels these days\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but at that price it should be wireless. I was again surprised to learn that the W hotels do not have SPG preferred rooms or floors. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a club room or free hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ourves, but as a Platinum member I would have assumed I would get one of the top floors/best views and some complimentary water. I was mistaken on both these accounts. The coup-de-grace (pardon my computers inability to add the accent) was in the morning when I realized there was no coffee maker in the room. The Sheraton and Westin both have a single cup brewer with complimentary Starbucks. The W does have some good complimentary coffee, but you have to go to the lobby to get it. Again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being high maintenance, but I personally like to lounge around and not get ready to go before I have my coffee. Trust me, no one wants to see me before I have my coffee\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6sadly many did. The bar (Whiskey Blue) is the same as all the other Whiskey Blue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the other W hotels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice place to grab a martini, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to linger there long, especially in New Orleans which boast some fantastic bars and music venues. The staff was mediocre at best. They remind me of the staff that waits on my wife when we shop at Gucci or Neiman Marcus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re annoying them with your presence, rather than being treated like someone dropping $2,000 on a purse. The mgmt was friendly, but everyone else made me feel like I was an after-thought. Again this was a huge surprise to me b/c I usually experience nothing but class and warmth when staying in other Starwood properties. The location was good and the hotel rooms were quiet. It was a quick walk to the French Quarter and the river, roughly a city block away from both. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big mall about a block away in the Westin. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Du Monde and the heart of the French Quarter are about 15 minutes away walking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directly across the street from the casino and easily accessible to cabs. The pool is small, but gets good sun and in the blistering heat of the summer I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely refreshing. Sadly when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 85 outside, the pool was somewhere just barely north of freezing cold. The workout facilities are also nice, but for some odd reason you actually have to walk outside to get to the workout room. Normally this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be an issue, but the one morning it was raining I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy getting wet before I went to run. There are three little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cabana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type things next to the pool with tv and dvd players, covered seating, and ceiling fans. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much use for them, but again, when its 100+ outside I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a little slice of heaven. Overall our stay was satisfactory, but at the rates they charge, it should have been much, much better. I would recommend, at those rates, staying at a more boutique type hotel or higher end hotel (ala Four Seasons or Ritz) that is focused on service rather than being hip. The W is about metro-sexual cool far more than it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about comfort and relaxation. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the 24 x 7 techno in the lobby and elevators appeals to a very specific crowd, that crowd just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t me. Oh yeah, I also booked my parents a room on points (thus $0 for the room) and they charged $130 ($65 a night) as SPG reimbursement fees??? When my father asked for a copy of the bill he was told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and she then started waiting on the person behind him.

We were greeted warmly and quickly every time we entered the hotel and were granted a change of room request with no problem at all (wanted a room with a view of the river). 2 The room was very clean and the bed was superb. Nice soft sheets, feather pillows, and Bliss bath products. 3 I love the location of the W on Poydras because I personally don't like staying in the Quarter. It's only a few blocks from the Quarter and is an easy walk. I realize safety is a concern for alot of people, and though I am not from New Orleans and cannot speak with the authority of a local, I do visit several+ times a year. That being said, I would have no problem walking to and from the W to the Quarter. Just avoid the smaller side streets and use the same common sense you would use in any city. Also, cabs are in plentiful supply and it's pretty much $10 plus or minus a few dollars to most destinations in the city. Additionally, Mothers is across the street and Restaurant August is about a block away. Two ends of the dining spectrum, both excellent. The casino is across the street as well. 4 The pool area is on the 4th floor deck and is alot of fun. Plenty of seating. Too cold to use during our stay, but I don't really expect to find a heated pool in New Orleans. Cons: 1 The rooms are a bit tiny and there really isn't sufficient room for luggage. My husband had to work at the desk and I would have to climb over the bed to pass. Not a big deal, but I can imagine it being one if I was rooming with someone who doesn't pack lightly. 2 The concierge --although wonderfully helpful --tended to help people who called in before people who were standing and waiting in person. I experienced a couple of lengthy waits. I realize it can be quite alot to handle with multiple lines in person and on the phone, but it's just a personal pet peeve of mine. I feel people who are waiting in line should be helped first. 3 We checked out the day of the Sugar Bowl, and I expected that the city (and hotel) would be overcrowded, but it took valet an hour and a half to retrieve our vehicle. Yes, I should have called down early, but good grief. I think an hour and a half is just inexcusable.

I forgot that there were three football games going on that weekend, and prices were high ($420 a night) due to the high occupancy rate. So I transferred some AMEX points over to Starwood to book the room. As a tourist to New Orleans, I like to stay in the French Quarter since that's where I end up most of the time. The W in the Quarter was fully booked so I booked this one instead, just a few blocks across canal. When I pulled up to the carport there were no bellmen out to assist with luggage. Not a big deal except that the valet were in abundance just staring at me. I walked into the hotel and got my own cart, loaded it and started to wheel it into the hotel. Only then did the valet ask if I was parking with them (duh?). I handed one of them the keys and a five and up came a bellman that was very nice and helpful. The lobby was typical W; plush sofas, funky lighting and original art. Funny thing though, they were playing the Hotel Costes CDs - literally the music CDs mixed for the Hotel Costes in Paris. Sort of like Wendy's selling Big Macs... The room was tiny but adequate. I went to get ice and the machine was broken, so I went to the floor above. It was broken. I checked floors 17 through 20. All the machines were broken. The next day the elevator stopped on 12 and a lady got on with ice. She said she was staying on 9 and the machine was broken there!

We booked a Starwood Internet Special at $199 and based on the rates I have paid at other hotels in the Quarter, this is a fairly good deal. The hip and trendy factor may not be as strong as in other W properties-- but then again you're not in San Diego or Miami either. Room accommodations were as advertised/expected, and location is central and hard to beat if your plans include the Superdome, Casino, Riverfront, & Bourbon Street.

As a rule, I don't provide negative reviews, but I will tell you some hotels in the Quarter are downright filthy and moldy, and a really bad value for the money.

The apex of the entire experience really has to be the, heavily advertised and much touted, Christmas brunch. While very sparsely attended (e.g. 70% tables vacant), the staff was asking a number of guests, after having already seated them, to leave the dining room and sit at the booths outside the main area - still not quite clear why. It would take more than 30 minutes to be served, and even then the servers forgot half of the order. All interraction was done with a huff - just really had an impression that the staff did not want to be there, they did not want guests there, or possibly both... I had ordered a soup that was brought to me with a question: \"Did you want a spoon with that?\", only to be given a spoon that the server brought in his bare hands, holding it by the mouth-piece. I wanted to leave all along, but my husband did not want a contretemps on Christmas - so we stayed.

She was attending a conference and the W was one of the conference hotels. Having heard so much about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trendy and hip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd W chain, we decided to try it. As this was also the first weekend of Jazz Fest, the hotel was filled to capacity. My overall impression is that, in its current condition, the W is not a 4-star hotel by any means. Although the staff was very friendly and helpful (and glad to welcome tourists), the W still has a way to go before it can again be considered a 4-star property. The W is in a great location, backed up to the Windsor Court Hotel (a true 4-star) and across the street from the Harrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Casino. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convenient to the Convention Center, business district and the Warehouse District (cool art galleries and restaurants). The legendary Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Caf\u00c3\u00a9 is just a few steps away, with great Southern home-style breakfasts and po\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 boy sandwiches. The Riverside Mall, Shops at Canal Street, Aquarium, and Canal Street streetcars are within a couple of blocks. The French Quarter is a 10-minute walk away. (Be careful walking as the sidewalks are still in bad shape and it's easy to trip.) The W has a very cool vibe. The lobby and bar area (which also serves as a breakfast caf\u00c3\u00a9) is very modern, with lots of interesting furniture and accessories. Complimentary copies of USA Today, New York Times and the Times-Picayune are usually available in the lobby. We also found a USA Today outside our door each weekday morning. The availability of three PC terminals (and a color laser printer) in the lobby made it easy to check email and print our boarding passes for the trip home. The upscale/trendy Whiskey Blue bar on the lobby floor makes a great mango/mint mohito, but the ever-present pounding techno music made it difficult to carry on a conversation. Upon check-in, we were told that there were no king rooms available, despite the fact that we had made reservations more than four months ago. The desk clerk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153found\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd us a king room, however, after we complained and flashed our Priority Club card. She did us no favor, however, as our 5th floor room was located near the outdoor pool area on the fourth floor. The sound system played incessant techno music 24-hours a day, which got old very quickly. Since the hotel was booked solid, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to ask for a room change, but in hindsight, I should have. Upon entering the room, we found both nightstand lamps, the CD player and the TV turned on (to the W promo channel with audio turned down). In a time when we should all be concerned with saving energy, I consider this practice wasteful. The lamps and TV were again on each time we returned to our room after housekeeping had cleaned it. Again, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no excuse for this kind of waste. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m more than capable of turning on a light when I enter a room. The room was spacious, with a large work desk, a velvet-covered daybed, and a small cabinet, which housed a mini-refrigerator. Clothes storage was limited to three small drawers in each of the nightstands. The closet space was adequate, although we had to request additional hangers, as well as a second terry cloth robe. (The robes are a nice touch.) The closet also contained a small safe, handy for stashing jewelry and other valuables. The furniture was finished in black lacquer, but showed signs of wear, as did the daybed, which had some small stains and fraying at the seams. The room featured white wooden shutters, which I preferred over heavy drapes, although they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide much soundproofing from the street noise and poolside music. The king bed was very comfortable, with both a down-filled mattress topper and down comforter in a maroon duvet cover. The down-filled pillows were large and soft, although we both prefer a firmer pillow. The room had a large-screen tube TV (rather than a flat panel LCD), as well as a DVD player and clock radio with a CD player. A complimentary library of DVDs and CDs is available in the lobby. A wall-mounted thermostat allowed us to control the room temperature and circulation fan. Overall, the room was nice, but in need of a refreshing. There were noticeable stains and wear in the carpeting, with fraying at the bathroom door saddle. The bathroom featured a granite-topped vanity, with a stainless steel sink bowl and sleek chrome fixtures. You need to be careful when turning on the faucet, as the water splashes back on you because of the sink\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s design. The shower had excellent water pressure and warmed up quickly. The tile and tub area showed signs of mildew. There was no ventilation fan in the bathroom, which made the mildew problem worse. The bathroom floor was sticky to the touch, so I wiped it down with a wet towel. My wife appreciated the large, wall-arm-mounted makeup mirror, which also served as a nightlight. The Bliss toiletries were very nice, although our housekeeper neglected to replace the shampoo on more than one occassion. I finally resorted to stashing a bottle in my toilet kit, to ensure that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have a supply for the following morning. The bath towels were small and rather thin for an upscale hotel. Considering the quality of the bed linens, the bath accessories should have been of better quality. There was no in-room coffee maker, a feature we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to expect for that first eye-opening cup in the morning. The lobby bar charged $3 for a cardboard cup of coffee, which really should have been complimentary. I used the pool only once during our stay. As others have noted, it photographs better than it is in reality. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small pool, but it was refreshing to take a dip in the 85 degree heat. Several people commented that the fitness facility was excellent, although we did not use it. Like most NOLA hotels, the W is understaffed and it clearly shows in the housekeeping staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of attention to detail. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite know what to expect post-Katrina, but I did expect more of a 4-star hotel. Under the current circumstances, I'm more than willing to cut them some slack. The city is clearly in the early stages of recovery and we hope that our visit contributed to its comeback. NOLA is truly a unique gem and deserves our support. Overall, I found the W New Orleans to be a friendly, pleasant experience, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not likely to stay here in the future.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento Valley", "Title": "\u201cGreat Locale, Comfy Beds, Free Workstations/Internet\u201d", "Author": "SeminarTrekker", "ReviewID": "UR7185729", "Content": "We stayed in NOLA (New Orleans, LA) in March 07' for pleasure. The first part of our trip we stayed at Budget Inn called O'Keefe Plaza (formerly Sleep Inn). The weather during our entire trip was superb, short sleeves and shorts during the day. Sunny and warm and not Humid at all. I've written a review on the O'Keefe which is strictly budget and where you want to save $$$. The W Hotel on Poydras (There is another W Hotel in the French Quarter) is towards the other end of the spectrum...chic semi luxury hotel. The W Hotel is within easy walking distance of the French Quarter, Aquarium, Convention Center, Harrahs Casino (across the street), and the River Walk. The W Hotel is safe walking to the French Quarter in the late evening because there are many nice hotels around the W and many folks walking back and forth from their Hotels to the Quarter. Our room was on a high floor and quiet. Though every night we did hear one or two sirens from vehicles on Poydras. There are several local hospitals at the end of Poydras. The bed had nice linens and was very comfortable. The room is very small compared the low end budget inn the O'Keefe Plaza. The surround area is more convenient and nicer at the W on Poydras than the O'Keefe Plaza. The W decor is suppose to be chic but I found the laquered black furniture to be kind of cheap and too trendy. I believe the W New York near Times Square is much nicer! Personally I not into the Ultra Modern Chic look and I would not pay more for lodging for this style. I just prefer good quality clean and comfortable furnishings. My only real complaints about this W Hotel is that the bathroom sink when turned on can splash water back on you. Also there is no air circulation fan in the bathroom. Also one of room card keys did not work twice. The service was great at the front desk as well as cleaning staff. The baggage folks were good too. The clientel appears to be business folks and convention folks. Because the new U.S.S. New Orleans was being christened this week, there were Navy Officers at the W Hotel too. I stay at theW on Poyrdas, again...if I could get a good rate...but I would not pay their standard rate, because I do not believe their room is worth paying a lot of money for, and besides...while in NOLA, both day and night...you want to be spending you time checking out all of the eye candy in the Quarter and sampling good local cuisine and local drinks like the hand grendade!!! The lobby is large and there are many folks drinking at night because there is a bar in the lobby and so there is noisy with the loud music playing. There are free copies of the local newspaper, Picayne Times, WSJ and NY TImes in the lobby each morning. You also have many workstations in the lobby where you have free internet access. I printed out my return boarding pass at one of their worstations. Some W guest eat at the tables in the lobby with takeout food from local eateries. the lobby is noisy at night to the crowds drinking and loud music. We did not eat in the W Hotel, but there a popular local resturant, Mothers, right next door. Mothers serve tasty and ample servings of Black Beans and Rice, Jambalaya, Gumbo, Fried Chicken. I really liked their hearty breakfasts and especially their ham biscuits! Yummy but it is very crowed on the weekends and much better on the weekdays. Across the street from the W Hotel is Harrahs Casino. Harrahs weekend buffet dinner at $28.00 plus is not worth it! Not tasy and kind low quality. I can recommend Antoines on Bourbon street for high end Creole dishes. I also recommend Zydelc BBQ next to Bourbon Cowboy Bar. Some of the best dry rubbed BBQ ribs I've tasted. The best friend chicken (Cajun seasoning) in NOLA was at bar called Coops on Deacatur street, east of the Cafe DuMond. Coops also features rabbit in their Jambalaya. Another overrated restaurant was the Gumbo Shop. Average and their Southern Pecan Pie was one of the worst. Some best priced tourist souvenirs shops on Deacatur across from the Hard Rock Cafe. Tourist souvenir shops on Bourbon and Canal streets tend be more expensive. The Shops at the Canal Street Mall are typical shops are find in most malls across the country. The mall does not seem too busy. Tours and local sites: We went on guided cemetary tour but it is safe to go to the old cemetary north of the Quarter without a tour guide. While it is near Housing Project, there is police substation just down the street and we saw several young single women by themselves with expensive digital cameras touring the old cemetary. Our Tour Guide, Al was very knowledgeble. We booked online and met our Tour Guide at Coffee shop on Royalestreet. There are great souvenir shop just down the street on Royal. You walk to the cemetary north of the Quarter. Al's wife picked us up and drove us to 2nd part of the time. Voodoo Temple with a Voodoo. the Voodoo priestess was too busy talking on her cell, so we left after a short while. We went on a combo Plantation & Swamp tour which we signed up online, Plantation Tours. It was $110.00 per person and they pick up by van at your hotel and basically drop you off at the sites where you get tours by the local site guides. if you don't like to be rushed around, it might be better to rent a car and driver out there yourself. it was over hour drive to the plantations along the river. Our first stop was the Oak Alley Plantation which covers large ground and you could spend a good half day there. Plus there was a Steam Paddle Boat parked out on the river. Our next stop was the Evergreen Plantation which you make to make special arrangements in advance because it is still a residence. This plantation is the only one according to our tour guide that still have former slave quarters. After the our van picked us up and we almost ran into a tour coach bus, we were dropped off at local diner where lunch was included on the tour. Our Van Tour Guide really just drives us to the local sites and let's the local tour guides give us the tour. So bring lots of dollars bills because you have to tip lots of folks. Our Van Tour guide was suspect in the info. he was giving us. Included in this tour at the local diner were choice of Po Boy Sandwiches or Burgers or Fried Seafood plus gumbo or salad and drink. The service was suspect and food so so. Our Swamp Tour van came by five minutes after we sat down for lunch and then came back 30 minutes later. The Swamp Tour was conducted by Cajun Pride. I thought this would be like a nature tour into the Bayou/Swamp. But in reality it was kiddy ride with too much time spent feeding junior size alligators. The best part to the tour was our boat guide pulling pranks on the tour participants. After the tour, Cajun Pride drove us back to our Hotels. The most interesting tour we took in NOLA was the Katrina Tour. The clean up has been completed. But there are thousands of empty homes in both middle and lower income neighborhoods. Some folks live in these empty neighborhoods but they live in white FEMA supplied trailers. Or a few are raising their homes by 12 feet. The tour was via Greyline tours and our tour guide was very guide. We only stopped once at the central park and received a free beverage at the gift shop. This tour also gives you sample of the neighborhoods surrounding NOLA so I would call it the Greater NOLA & Post Katrina tour. You drive by the canals that broke open and caused most of the flooding in NOLA. I think disaster is worst than 911...because so many folks whose homes and lives have forever changed. It just incredible home many neighbors are vacant.

The chaise lounge in our room was very cool, other than the cigarette burn in it! The bathroom shower is a strange set up - there is just an opening to walk into and it is the same end as the towel rack, which my husband (who is 6'1\") kept knocking his head on. There is no fan in the bathroom. The wonders of photography make the pool look MUCH cooler on their website than in person. Word to the wise on dining - I got two ham & egg croissant sandwiches in the morning without asking the cost and was FLOORED to be charged almost $18.00!!! This was at a counter I walked up to where they were ready made & already wrapped. They were very good but that is a ridiculous price when it isn't room service, and not even a restaurant! My husband and I took to calling the \"Whatever, Whenever\" policy \"Whatever, Never\". It seemed that every time we had any type of a request or question during our 4 nt stay that we would come up empty. I am very sympathetic to Katrina but it seems that their staff is in need of some additional training. We asked where we could get food delivered late one night and were told that there wasn't anywhere and the only option was to go eat at Harrah's across the street.

I really can't fault their staff enthusiasm, service commitment and relentless cheerfulness. I can, though, seriously criticise what is a worn out and shabby property that does not justify the room rate. Rooms are poky, with teeny bathrooms equipped with joke baths and weak showers. Doors collide with each other and even getting into some rooms requires the skills of a gymnast. Beds are comfy though. Worst aspect is the appalling lack of sound insulation - privacy is non-existent. I had three rooms in a week so can comment from bitter experience. Maintenance and upkeep needs to be more proactive - basic stuff like flat safe batteries shouldn't happen. Heating and ventilating in some public rooms was terrible - roast or freeze. Background music was offensively loud. Mass catering was weak, poorly presented and fat laden. The Zoe restaurant was OK but dimly lit and with all the ambience of a 1970s motorway cafe.

He said he could change us to a king size in the morning. They could, but we declined, as we were enjoying the view from the 22nd floor.

With that in mind, this review is somewhat handicapped. Had this W been anywhere else, I probably would have rated it three stars; however, some of the issues noticed during my stay are more attributable to labor shortages than a wavering commitment to guest satisfaction. Starting with the positive, the property is in great shape. My room was well appointed, spotlessly clean, and stylish without being over the top. Thankfully, the room was not as cluttered with merchandise and novelties as some other W properties. The common areas were also clean and attractive. Unlike some W's that place busy a lounge right in the middle of the lobby, this W wisely places it to the side, allowing ordinary guests to check in and return to their rooms with ease. The more subdued lounge areas provided a great spot to enjoy wireless Internet access, read the Sunday paper, and catch up with friends and business associates. Employees were generally responsive and courteous. Like most New Orleans residents, they seemed genuinely appreciative of travelers returning to the city. Housekeeping was prompt and efficient, as were the valet parking staff. My bill after a four-night stay was 100% accurate with no erroneous charges to haggle over. Keeping in mind that this stay was 80% positive, let me provide a few observations about areas for improvement. First, I never got to try the property's restaurant, Zoe. Twice, I tried to have breakfast there, but both times the host station was unstaffed. Once, I was acknowledged by a server but was told I would have to sit in the lounge area until called. Since there were abundant tables open, I can only guess that the delayed seating was due to insufficient staffing, a widespread problem after Katrina. Not having time to wait, I crossed Tchoupitoulas Street to have breakfast at Mother's, an unpretentious New Orleans-style cafeteria. Another problem, which is probably more attributable to a worldwide W policy than any decision by this property, was the difficulty in finding affordable and readily availble bottled water. Sure, the minibars were stocked with Voss, but the price was high: $6.59 per bottle once taxes are included. Given that some visitors are understandably wary of the tap water in New Orleans, perhaps W should provide a few complimentary bottles. Ideally, W properties worldwide should scrap the outdated minibar concept and provide in-room refrigerators that guests can stock with reasonably priced goods bought from an on-site shop or from outside. The location of this W is ideal, halfway between the Convention Center and the French Quarter, so if business brings you to New Orleans, by all means consider this property -- but be prepared to eat at nearby restaurants such as Mother's, Cuvee, and August in lieu of eating on site until staffing returns to normal levels. And, of course, bring some bottled water.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cGym nice, rooms eh.\u201d", "Author": "plmc23", "ReviewID": "UR5392914", "Content": "I have not stayed at a W before.

The bar/lobby area is great for meeting up with people for a drink -- it isn't a generic hotel bar. My standard room with two beds is rather cramped. For a business traveler who needs workspace, it is not convenient. The bathroom, esp. if sharing with colleagues, has small counter space and there is no ventilation. Wear and tear is beginning to show in the rooms, but the public areas seem in better condition. It was fairly clean, but sometimes it didn't smell that fresh.

Some good fortune opened up and I got reservations at the W at a great price AND a $35 gift card to both the W Store and Banana Republic. I love the W's thing - I can depend on a unique, designed experience from check-in to check-out. I think some people don't get the W - I overheard someone say \"See, they have lots of black painted plywood in New York\" while pointing to the black-finished wood walls of the elevator interiors. Then she wrinkled her nose. W on a vacation is pure comfort. No scratchy floral bedspread on the bed. No brass-and-marble lobby. Pull up a seat and have a drink at the lobby bar, or relax on the chaise in the room. Try some of the great Bliss products - throw on this year's W CD. It's like home but much, much better looking. Some won't understand. \"Why are the halls so dark?\" they'll say as they return from breakfast. The W in the CBD is different from the French Quarter variety, but I think thats OK - each one has a strong identity. The W is great at taking less desireable buildings and turning them into amazing spaces, and this hotel is ideally located just a block off the beaten path between the gallery district and the French Quarter. If it's raining, you can spend a good part of the walk back to your hotel inside Harrah's. The streetcar is just a few blocks away for a stroll through the cemetaries or to see firsthand just a tiny bit of the destruction Katrina brought. The French Quarter is alive with construction right now, and it was amazing to see a comeback unfolding before us. The W shows a few, tiny signs of wear - they were still fixing wireing in the lobby, and the hallyway carpets looked a little worn, but that can certainly be forgiven at a time like this. I kept realizing the hotel staff I was meeting might not have had long working there - but everything was handled in the same way I'd expect at any W - with a great deal of approachable friendliness with just enough hipness to inspire me to spend an hour strolling he lobby taking photographs, hang with a friend in the little alcove beneath the lobby stairway, be amazed at the wonderful entryway surprise when coming in from the valet area. Keeping me happy, letting me know I'm having a premium experience, while always treating me like I deserve it. There is a nice rooftop pool, great robes in the rooms, a DVD player under the TV, a delicious glass of juice at check-in, Mother's next door, and a big beautiful French Quarter just a few blocks away! And then... there's the most comfortable bed - I have begun modeling my own at home after it - the W Store gift card came in handy when I bought four of their pillows for my home. When was the last time you WANTED your hotel pillows at home, instead of the other way around? Not a bad thing happend. Not a moment was wasted.

When we checked in I was somewhat concerned because I could tell that they were short staffed and over stretched. Not the friendliest check in either. Only one of the elevators was working so that was extremely annoying. The W had only been reopened a week since Katrina when we were there. The room was nice, small but with a great Poydras St view. The problems then started: toilet was not clean. Bathroom sink would not drain; bathroom cleanliness overall was not good. I thought that perhaps the room had not been used since the previous August. When I called the front desk, they promised to come and make corrections to the sink at least-never happened. Mardi Gras morning-went to see the parades and then wanted to get our car out of the garage. Not happeniing! Because the police start closing the streets early and all around the hotel, there was no way to get your car back until after the majority of the parades went by. When I asked why this was not mentioned at check in, I just got shrugged shoulders. I was not happy, especially since the parking was over $30 per day. It took us until about 3 that afternoon to get our car, we had to walk several blocks to the Warehouse District where the cars are parked. The staff was great though, about letting us keep our bags there, and the guys in the parking lot were awesome! My credit card was charged for the parking fees, but I complained on the W website and they refunded me the cost of the parking, as well as awarding me additional guest points for thje prob lems we had.

We're locals and wanted a girl's night out downtown while summer hotel rates were low, $119. I reserved a room described as City View, High Floor Room, Panoramic Views of the City. That wasn't a request but the actual description of the room on the reservation. We checked in at 5pm with a receptionist with an unfriendly attitude to find that our room was on the 4th floor. The highest floor available was the 7th. I personally don't mind unfriendly employees as long as they are taking care of your needs. In this case she wasn't doing anything to try to get us the room that we had booked. I found it hard to believe that two hours after check-in during the slowest season of the year that there were no rooms higher then the 7th floor. We took Room 405 since it was near the pool entrance. The view was of Poydras Street and the Loews Hotel across the street, not terrible but not panoramic at all. Bad service with an attitude at the front desk. The room itself was nice but a little worn. It had two double beds and there was very little extra space. I would not call this a big hotel room, only average. The beds were the absolute best part with pillowtop mattresses, featherbeds and down comforters. We popped a bottle of champagne to start the night and there was no ice bucket. There happened to be an employee in the hall. He said there should be one and saw that ours was missing and promptly brought us one, which was probably the best service we had the whole time. The ice bucket was very small and held the bottle and about 5 ice cubes. The next morning after a long night of partying and gambling, there were several problems which kept us from sleeping. First was the fire alarm that went off at about 9am for several minutes. Next was the 11:30am wake-up call that the front desk accidentally called for at 10:30am and realized their mistake half way through speaking. Of course I was already awake by then. Then lastly was the lack of a Do Not Disturb sign. The \"Style\" employees once again disturbed the precious 4 hours of sleep that we attempted. The last thing that proved the lack of attention-to-detail was the New York Times that they delivered after they asked if I wanted the Wall Street Journal or the local paper and I requested the local paper, the Picayune. I got neither of the above. Just a random example of the clientele here. Most people were in their 20s and 30s. But there is a whole other sector which is the older men who want to be cool and are looking for young women. We walked out by the pool and a group of men who were renting a cabana asked if we'd like a cocktail or a car or a house. These are the kind of people who are staying here. That's just a generalization of course but it was a common theme. Great if you're looking for a sugar daddy but otherwise just annoying. In my opinion, for the same location, Loews is a much superior hotel. And the Hotel Monaco is my favorite in this price range. Those two are also pet friendly which we sometimes require.

Yes the W is very pet friendly. Well there was a housekeeper just outside the door, as we approached she turned to us with a smile and warned us, \"Please watch your step.\" as polite as could be as she was cleaning a mess on the ground. No hint of attitude. There was a manager type in a suit guarding the exit from inside the loby. Apparently one dog had an accident right in the door way, and the owner just left it there.

The staff and greeters in the lobby made us feel like we were \"special\" every time we passed through--offering my kids everything from band-aids for blisters on their feet after walking in the French Quarter to apples for treats. Concierge directed us to excellent food and easy transportation. Even the valet treated us to top notch service, with offers for directions and very fast service (one call before I left my room and the car was waiting at the door when we came down on every occasion we needed the car). Greeters and staff in the lobby even petted my dog and offered her treats, plus a special \"doggy welcome package\", with treats, a ball, a leash, and collar. I'm not sure why others complained of small rooms or unfriendly atmosphere because I've never seen a friendlier, more eager to please staff in my life! Periodically, they would send up someone to our room just to make sure all our needs were met and room service was incredibly fast. The rooms and beds were so comfortable, we never wanted to leave (the chaise lounge itself was comfortable enough to sleep in and the bed was like sleeping on clouds!), and the location was excellent--walking distance to the trolley and the French Quarter, near Harrah's for anyone interested in gambling. Lots to do nearby, but the best part of our stay in New Orleans was our rooms and treatment at The W. Even though a convention was also at the hotel at the time, we were literally treated like royalty even though I know they were busy with other guests (and we're not rich jet-setters or royalty---just a regular family visiting New Orleans) We go to New Orleans every year at least once and I will be planning my stay around availability at The W.

The hotel is also very close to many great upscale restaurants (Cuvee and Emeril's), a nice wine bar (Wine Loft), and a cool lounge (Club 360). The W is decorated in a very modern and trendy style in colors of red, black, and silver. The lobby, bar, and pool areas are dotted with numerous lit candles and unique, stylish lighting. Throughout the hotel trance and techno music is piped in giving the hotel a very cool vibe. You almost feel as if you are in your really cool friend's apartment in L.A. or N.Y. Most of the guests at the hotel are young (20's and 30's), trendy, well-dressed, and have cash to burn. This is where the jet set hangs when in NOLA. I expected to, and did, run into a couple of celebrities while spending the week at the hotel as well. Given the trendy and cool atmosphere that this hotel exudes one might expect the hotel staff to be snobby. This could not be farther from the truth. Service is where this hotel shines.

The rooms are an average size and are decorated similar to the rest of the hotel in reds, blacks, and silvers. If you have heard of the famous W beds - they live up to all the hype that they get! They are so comfortable that breakfast in bed is a must. The room also features a comfortable chaise lounge that is perfect for reading the morning paper as well as a DVD and CD player. Make sure to request a room that has a view of the river. One side of the hotel only has a view of a parking lot. Aside from the bar in the lobby the W has a separate lounge/bar attached to it called Whiskey Blue. This cool lounge is dimly lit by mostly candles and decorated in dark blues, purples, and beiges. Whiskey Blue is a perfect spot to meet up with friends for a martini before heading out to dinner or for a little partying. It is also a nice spot to wind down in after a long night out on the town as well.

Worth and REALLY enjoyed overselves. The hotel was outstanding from the layout, the design, and decor. I have absolutely no complaints about the hotel itself and can not add much more info then what hasn't already been said by others. The staff on the other hand, although MOST were extremely friendly they were all very young and seemed poorly trained. I had reserve the \"24 Hours of Love\" package (I won't go into dirty details about) which was more than I would normally spend for one night at a place that I knew very little about. We did arrive early that day at about 2:30 for the 3:00 check in and were told that the room would be ready at 3:00 because they were cleaning it. That was fine as I knew we were early and had no problem waiting because we had already wandered around the French Quarter, had lunch at NOLA (which is an Emeril Lagisse restaurant which I HIGHLY recommend, reservations encouraged!), and drove around the city for awhile. Needless to say, after my wife falls asleep on the couch in their \"lobby\" I went back up to the counter to ask if the room was ready and they said that they were still working on it. Finally at around 4:30!!! we get our room. The \"extras\" as part of the package that I reserved were no where to be found in the room much to my disappointment and after making a phone call to the desk they assured me that it was on its way up. Finally a knock on the door and someone with room service brings in part of the \"package\". Still disappointed as to where the rest of the \"package\" is after we left, went to Harrahs, ate the fantastic seafood buffet, and came back, I called room service again. This time they ask me when do I want the rest of the \"package\" and I said \"Just bring it up\". Well, she insisted that we vacate the room while they bring it up and prepare the \"presentation\" so we went downstairs, sat in the bar (which was in MAJOR need of a waiter to clean) and went back upstairs to see the \"presentation\". Now, mind you, the \"package\" was no surprise to my wife as I had already explained it to her before we even arrived. I told the front desk people this also and they still wanted to make some big ordeal out of it when all I wanted in the beginning was to have it prepared and brought up if not when the room was ready but at least while we were gone to Harrahs. Long story even longer, we loved everything about the \"package\" and the place. At check out (which I never do in person, what a waste of time when you can do it through the TV) we went down stairs to retrieve the rental car which I had called to have brought up and the valets were probably the rudest individuals I had ever met! Not only did they shun us (I guess it was because we had a Dodge Neon as a rental, but why would I even bother renting anything bigger when all we had were carry-on bags for a ONE night stay in New Orleans), but they acted bothered by our presence. As soon as these other people came out with their 6 pieces of luggage the valet immediately parked their Cadillac SUV about 5 feet in front of our rental, rolled up the luggage and people in front of the car and caused us to not be able to move an inch to leave. This after them not even so much as opening the door of our car for my wife! Maybe this is being petty but for a place like the W which is trying to make a name for themselves as being HIGHER than high class it was extremely disappointing. Not to mention that I use to live in Las Vegas and even some grocery stores have valet parking with attendants willing to do anything for you! Oh well, all said and done we'll probably stay at the W in the French Quarter next time (even if this one wasn't very far from it) as we really did enjoy the hotel itself.

(After reading some negative reviews here, I sense that some of these poor souls lose more than spare change - and expect that the hotels in the area make it up to them). As others have noted here, this was the most comfortable hotel bed you'll ever sleep in. Also, the cushy chaise lounge is a great amenity. I enjoyed watching my lovely wife stretch out and read there. Mini bars are what they are - overpriced. We never use them. We travel with our own Martini kit.

Loved the vibe of the hotel. Very modern. Great for the younger 30 something crowd. Not to be age pregidous but, didn't see anyone here that was \"older 60+\" like other hotels in the immediate area as this one. Pros about the hotel: Great beds, down pillows were great. Has very nice robes in room, CD player and DVD player. Also has a neat candy machine in the room that is a nickle for some hot tamale candy. I thought it was a VERY quite hotel, but again we stayed on the 19th Floor. Just about 3 blocks or so from the French Quarter and directly across the street from Harrahs Casino. There are some cons about this hotel - REMEMBER - if you drive down your parking is NOT FREE! Looking at about $32.00 extra tacked on the hotel bill for valet overnight parking. Don't be surprised about this as alot of the nicer hotels around New Orleans does this. The rooms are a bit small for the price of the room. Paid $209 for a basic king bedroom. No frills - nice mini bar in room but VERY expensive. $4 bucks for a candy bar!

So tight you have to close the bathroom door to open the room door! Strange lobby that is a martini bar, entrance has an empty bed inside the main door?? My tip is hit the Harrahs across the street for fresh Starbucks morning coffee or a quick sandwich at casino prices.

What a shock it was to read a recent review that blasted the W for every possible thing. Apparently we stayed at different hotels. We didn't, but my experience was quite opposite to his. First, this is not a typical New Orleans/French Quarter hotel. If you want that type of hotel you must stay elsewhere. However, my wife and I have stayed many times in the French Quarter and we really enjoyed the drastically different type of hotel the W is. The staff could not have been more helpful. From the moment we got out of the cab we were welcomed with friendliness and care. Akita, checked us in and was wondeful. A nice young man took our luggage to the room and explained everything about the hotel on the way to the room and pointed out the many amenities in the room. He was kind enough to warn us about the high prices for the items in the courtesy bar. The room was spotless and the bed may be the best bed I have ever slept in. During the first full day at the W we came back from a morning and early afternoon of shopping and oysters to find our room was unmade. It was approximately 2:30 in the afternoon and we were ready for a nap!! I called the front desk and was informed that the cleaning staff had until 4:30 each day to complete making up the rooms. However, if we wanted ours done right away it could be done immediately. We asked if they would come up right away and they DID!!! In addition, if we needed the room done up early the next day, just let them know and it would be taken care of. The motto at the W is Whatever-Whenever for their customers and they certainly lived up to the motto for us. Throughout our stay the staff helped us with restaurant recommendations, making reservations for us, and arranging transportation. All with a great attitude and in a very prompt way. Yes, there is construction on a new hotel a block away and there is some noise from the equipment. However, the W has absolutely no control over the construction and was more than ready to move any customers to rooms further away from the noise. There was NO noise at night and my wife and I spent most days out on the town. So, this was not a problem for us. The experience at the W was great and I will return.", "Date": "August 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cThe Wonderful \"W\"\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2443752", "Content": "My husband and I chose the \"W\" Hotel for our romantic getaway, hoping for an experience worth our efforts.

The fact that the \"W\" staff thought enough to forewarn us meant a great deal. Pablo gave us a tour of the facilities and our room and, as promised, the noise was a bit bothersome, but it didn't detract from our enjoyment. The \"W\" also has great location- close enough for excitement (a few blocks' walk to the Quarter), but far enough for tranquility (a few blocks' walk from the Quarter).
