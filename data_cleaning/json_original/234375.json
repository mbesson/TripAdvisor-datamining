Let's see why: the Lido island is so wonderful, and the place around the hotel is very quiet. (I do not recommend to Ibiza lovers:) Behind the hotel it is a charming garden; you may have the breakfast there, or in front of the hotel, where you'll find a very nice place with stylish chairs, tables and flowers. In fact, everythig in this hotel is very stilysh. If you are a lucky person, or you pay it, you may have a room with a marvellous view with the lagoon. The breakfast is ok, 3-4 days, after that might be boring .The room isn' t small, isn't too large, but is nice decorated. The bathroom is very large and comfortable. What's wrong? Almost nothing, only...some of front desk staff is a little bit unfriendly.

It has a 24 hours staff that seems competent if not exactly friendly. The rooms were clean & large by European standards with a modern bathroom. The breakfast was good & plentiful but typical of what I had in Italy. Cold meats, croissants, yogurt, pastries etc... with very good coffee. The internet is not free, I believe its about 6 euro/hr or 22 euro/day. Thats about the same price as the internet shops in Venice but I think it's free & unlimited in some of the other hotels. You will need to take a waterbus from the train or bus station which is easier than it sounds. Just take one heading to Lido. Its usually the last stop. Its a very good idea to get the 24/48 or 72 hour pass, as you'll have to use the ferry every time you want to go to Venice proper. The waterbus ticket is also good for the bus on Lido island. Once in Lido, It's over a kilometer to and from the hotel, but a nice 20 minute walk down the promenade if your up for it. Just make a left as you leave the waterbus stop & walk along the water. If you're not up for the walk catch the bus to and from the hotel. The bus stops next to the hotel. I can't remember the bus numbers but they will be the ones across the street from the waterbuses pointing towards the left. You know when you've arrived when the bus goes around the roundabout to turn around. It sounds like a lot, but not as bad as it seems. Lido is also a nice little area with a small beach and some nice restaurants. Overall a pretty good experience.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel and location for visiting Venice!\u201d", "Author": "marct0603", "ReviewID": "UR118568622", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights whilst exploring the Lido and Venice. The hotel consists of the main hotel, an additional block of rooms and what looked like more rooms in an adjoining house. The views are excellent, rooms very clean and tidy and grounds well kept and relaxing. The check-in was good, with clear direction from the person on reception as to where our room was located. The room was part of a set of four, set in the grounds, opposite the main hotel, which consisted of the bedroom and en-suite. Plenty of space in the room and enough storage also. The bathroom was very nice and spacious. Breakfast was good, plenty of choice and always fully stocked and available. As it is fully self service, the staff are able to keep the food available at all times. Food choice includes cereal, ham, cheese, yogurts, pastries, rolls, boiled and scrambled eggs, sausages, bread, marmalade and jam, fruit juice, fruit, tomatoes, water, hot drinks etc. The terrace outside the front of the hotel is ideal for eating breakfast and also having a drink of an afternoon or evening. The hotel has a small bar area, serving basic wine, beer, spirits etc, which the receptionist is happy to serve as required. The garden area has a number of seating areas, all spacious, comfortable and relaxing. A good place to enjoy a drink after a days' sightseeing in Venice. There is a bus stop directly outside the hotel, which during the day has three buses an hour (bus V) to take you to the waterbus terminals along the Lido. (Bus G does the same route in the evenings.) ACTV is the local company that services the buses and waterbus, and you can easily get a ticket valid for 12/24/36/72 hours for ease of transportation. Well worth spending the money! AliLaguna is the waterbus from the aeroport to the Lido and again this is excellent, available twice every hour. It is cheaper to pre-book, as a single ticket is 16 euro, however a return in advance is 23 euro (use within 30 days). The hotel itself is right at the end of the Lido, and if you are traveling up from the Waterbus, it is approx 20-30mins walk along the water front, just past the St Nicolo aeroport. The Lido itself has a number of good places to eat. La Pizzeria restaurant which is the first restaurant you come to on the main street (G Vale S M Elizabetta) is great value for money and the pizza's are good! It is always busy in this restaurant. The best ice cream we found was at Magiche Voglie (further up the main street, left hand side). The Trattoria Al Botteri is very expensive and although they say cover charge is included, they then charge you a 12% service charge, so beware! also, avoid 'Gelateria Bar Maleti', as the waiter is too busy checking the local 'talent' and other distractions to serve you properly, whilst we were there, he managed to make four tables out of six unhappy - served us the incorrect drinks, didnt give cutlery to the table next to us, kept someone waiting 10mins for their change and ignored a request for bread from another table. When it came to paying the bill, we were told to go to the bar as he was too busy.

That was a bargain and this is by far the best hotel I've stayed at in Europe. I can't fault this hotel in any way and will return. The hotel is on the Lido island, not the central city island, and that's a huge blessing. It's really quiet and peaceful on the Lido and just a short waterbus (which doubles as a sightseeing ride) to the noisy and busy city centre. The transport runs 24 hours so you can party late in the centre and still get a quiet nights sleep.The hotel is only a short walk from Venice's only fine sand beach and you can tell it's good because locals flock there. There's plenty of room for everyone though, the beach is huge. The hotel was renovated last year and massively upgraded to a 4 star and it's gorgeous. The interior everywhere is plush (including Murano glass chandeliers) and they've somehow struck a balance between luxurious, classical and comfortable. This is the best designed hotel I've seen, I would live here if I could. Everything in the room was perfect, and easy. And generously sized. Soundproofing is great too. The hotel was full when we stayed and we didn't here a sound from any other room, or the stairs. Our room faced the main island and the unhindered view when sitting on the balcony at night of the city centre across the water was breath taking. Breakfast was excellent and extensive. All the food was top notch, for example the pastries were extremely soft and the milk was fresh and cold (a rare find in my experience). There is a breakfast terrace facing the water that offers the same amazing view as the balcony. This is one only a handful of hotels in Venice to offer free parking and it's very comforting not to have to leave your car on the mainland and carry luggage around. Parking at the hotel is off the road and the area is quite and safe... perfect.

You're there within about 30 minutes and can take great photos on the way too. Actually, the boat rides are very romantic and give you the REAL feeling of Venice. The bus and boats run every 10 minutes until late into the night. The rooms are wonderful here, although not very big, but nicely furnished, including a minibar and safe and good air conditioning (incl. heating, when necessary...). The bathrooms are done nicely in marble with bidet. Everything is clean and a lot of the rooms have balconies or terraces.

I had to take care of also my car. So the ideal place was Lido (di Venezia). From this point Buon Pesce seemed to be the best: easy to approach with car, with buses, with vaporetto. Before the journey my concerns were (based on the ratings): - the breakfast (it is not a British breakfast, I agree, but it was delicious and more than sufficient), - the distance from the vaporetto (it is about 400 from the Laguna Nord line, that goes twice an hour, and about 1 km from line 1, 52, etc., these go very frequently, in fact it was not worth to memorize, and buses start from the hotel six times per hour, I agree, in the nights there may be long waits for the bus) These problems may have been observed in the past, but now we had nothing to complain about. The rooms are clean, comfortable and well equipped. The triple room had a really big bed for two persons, and a smaller bed for one. The bathroom was clean and elegant, however, it is the time for the wallpainting. The personnel was nice, we had no communication problems (however, we would have been happy to be warned to the strike of vaporetto and bus drivers). We had a room with a distant view to Venice, in an environment that is quite elegant and quiet for the price. (And Lido itself worth to visit, if you are tired of Venice and the army of tourist.) One point for improvement: I think the 10 EUR per day for the internet access is really funny in 2009, if someone really need internet, then 15 EUR will buy a prepaid mobile internet package for 24 hour (that can be consumed in installments so probably it will be sufficient for an average tourist for 1-2 weeks when on holiday).", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money, quiet and reasonably pleasant.\u201d", "Author": "Comberdown", "ReviewID": "UR35161073", "Content": "I visited this hotel with a German friend, who made the booking online.

She also did not seem to have any computer available to check against. The hotel was actually fully booked and they only had rooms available for the first two nights (not the 3 nights I had on my confirmation). Eventually, after sitting in the reception for 20 minutes listening to frantic phone calls to other hotels in their chain, the duty manager came to the desk to deal with us. That night we were offered a triple and a double room for all 3 nights, not wishing to waste any more time we accepted the rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although the double room was very small with tiny bathroom module in one corner not much bigger than a wardrobe. When it was time to check out there was a new man on reception who we had not seen all weekend. I calmly explained the problems we encountered on arrival and suggested that our friends who had the smaller room should not pay the original price as this was for a larger triple room. His attitude instantly turned very aggressive and suggested that I should have phoned the Police on the first night if I was not happy with the arrangements!! I then proceeded to hand over my credit card to pay for my room and drinks that had been charged to the room. He then rudely informed that I had to pay cash for the drinks and that they should have been paid for when we had ordered them. Due the appalling attitude of the staff and the failure of their booking system I left this hotel in an absolute rage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not quite the prefect ending to a relaxing weekend away. If you have already booked a room with this hotel I would advise email or phoning before your arrival to check they actually have your booking.", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ENGLAND", "Title": "\u201cGreat Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MRSSUSIE", "ReviewID": "UR6784924", "Content": "Arrived at the hotel in the early evening and was greeted with a warm welcome by the member of staff on duty.

It was clean, and had a great view overlooking the lagoon across to San Marco. Blackout blinds were great keeping out the sun during nap time...bathroom was also a bit small, had a hairdryer. Mini fridge with drinks and snacks that are a bit over priced. The staff was very knowledgable/helpful and could book tours/ reccommend what to do during your stay.

When we first arrived on Lido we quickly caught the city bus to go to the hotel. It dropped us off right in front of the hotel( which was quite nice considering the amount of bags we have had to tote around venice to get to some other hotels). When we first walked into the lobby there was an italian gentleman raising his voice to the clerk stating his A/C in the room was broken. The clerk then proceeded to start yelling back at the man. The clerk told the man basically that he would have to deal with it. After the gentleman stormed out of the hotel. We then proceeded to the counter to check in. The clerk told us check in time was in 20 minutes and we would have to wait til then. I thought it was a little ridiculous, but if thats trhe hotels policy than ok. So we sat in the lobby til the 20 minutes had past. We proceeded to check in and the clerk was extremely rude to us and would talk condiscendingly to us. We blew that off thinking he was still mad from the incident earlier. We arrived at our room which was small but very clean and decorated nicely. The A/C was off when we got into the room so we turned it on and then left to go exploring around Venice. As we walked out there was another woman very angry with the clerk too. That night when we arrived to our hotel room the A/C was running , but it was not working. It was very hot in the room. I told the night clerk that the A/C in the room was not working. The night clerk (different from the day clerk) then looked at me and said \"did you turn it on\" with this very bad attitude. I told him it was on, but I told him to come and check to make sure we were operating it properly. He came and inspected it and basically said it was not working properly. I then asked him if we could change rooms. He then said they were full. I then asked him if there was anything he could do for us and he said and I quote \" the window does open up\". .....That was IT!! Now I'm mad! It takes alot for me to get mad. Needless to say that was our only night at this hotel and I would definitely NOT reccomend this hotel.

Its scary and around a 50minute walk back to the hotel at night. Aside from small problems we had with the hotel, these faded into insignificance after our experience on the last night. After going out for a few drinks we made the long 50minute walk after getting off the boat, back to our hotel. When we arrived it had SHUT! The gates had been barred up, the lights were off and no one was inside. We were terrified and stranded! We had to call the Lido Island Police from a telephone box we located.

Our hotel room, while small, but average for Europe (with a fine bathroom) faced the lagoon, with a clear shot to the Piazza San Marco across the Lagoon others might have a room facing the small green garden behind the hotel. Breakfast was the usual Continental with some great cereals and all the pastries and bread you can eat. The kitchen even made us a cappuccino without charge, just ask. Other reviews have mentioned the staff as being difficult and I will say that we encounted the same problem, however, I believe now that the young woman who was so impossible is no longer there (I am sure of that) the other young men who man the front desk were fine, but all they really do is check you in and collect your key. The Lido is home to many residents and when you get the bus once the vaparetto drops you at the Lido you spend about 10 minutes driving through some of the neighborhoods filled with trees. I would suggest that when you arrive with luggage that you hire a taxi to deal with your luggage. The hotel is too far to walk with suitcases. There is one block by the vaparetto stop that crosses the island and is filled with many bars, cafes and restaurants (we recommend the Roxy). My suggestion would be to buy a 3 day pass from the vaparetto office that also covers the fares on the bus - you will be riding at least 4 trips each day, so it's worth it.(22 euro for 72 hours, vs. 3 euro per trip.) I admit that while I generally stay in 4-5 star hotels, this hotel gives very good value for what you get. There are no services per se, but you do have a charming, smaller, quiet, clean hotel that I think typifies 3 star hotels in Europe. I think it's a great bargain and after visiting Venice over 5 times, staying mostly in the San Marco area, I enjoyed the Lido quite a bit.", "Date": "October 24, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Viktoria Palace Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d234375-Reviews-Viktoria_Palace_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$99 - $394*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Riviera San Nicolo, 50</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Lido di Venezia</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30126</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "234375", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b4/d3/b4d302ae66557d820886516ca1f0f3fb4large.jpg"}}
