I would definitely stay there again the next time I visit Florence.I don't know about the other rooms in the hotel, but I did get a bit of street noise and I recommend you bring earplugs - they worked perfectly for me. Florence is a hectic, vibrant city and noise is to be expected. I didn't hear any noise from the other rooms. Also, as others have posted, there are no televisions in the rooms (which is a big plus for me).

We were not disappointed -- the hotel is superbly kept, has very friendly and helpful hosts, and is as centrally located as possible. Alessio and Asumi go out of their way to make sure guests are comfortable and have the information they need for a great stay in Florence. I was particularly impressed that they made reservations for us at the Uffizi and Accademia before our arrival (at our inquiry), and that they provided us with an English language publication with local event schedules and current info and another kids publication which was fun for our daughter. We had a room with a shared bath, but even though the hotel was fully booked we never had a conflict with another guest. Although located in the middle of a very busy city, the Cestelli is on an extremely quiet narrow street, an oasis of calm before confronting the sea of humanity on the Ponte Vecchio or in any of the major piazzas, shopping streets, or tourist destinations.

We have just returned from our third visit and are just as enthusiastic about this hotel. Alessio and Asumi are still the perfect host and hostess and are as welcoming and helpful as ever. Hotel Cestelli offers a very Italian experience and dare we say it, is quite different from international tourist hotels catering for \u9225\u6e0bnternational tourists\u9225? Rooms are individually designed and furnished in a simple but very comfortable way. The style is all Italian and is a long way from either cheap international hotel chains (stripped of all character and atmosphere) or the more expensive international chains (offering services and facilities most of us would never need in Florence). If these are the sorts of hotels you long for, perhaps Hotel Cestelli is not for you. For a stay you will recall long after your holiday is over, and which will link you with the history and culture of Italy in a very real way, we believe Hotel Cestelli is a very special place. It reflects the very essence of Florence and is in a very convenient location in the oldest part of the city. It is very close to the Ponte Vecchio, and, indeed, all the important historic buildings. It is also tantalisingly close all the famous fashion houses (Ferragamo is almost next door). The great positives about this hotel for us have been the care, welcome and genuine friendliness of the hosts, the pleasant airy rooms with their very comfortable beds and the relative quietness of the position (always remembering that this is a very busy city!!). The things that are not here and we have never missed are radio, television and bedside telephone! Breakfast is not provided and that is not a problem. Simple Italian breakfasts are available everywhere and for an Italian that means a coffee and maybe a pastry!

My wife and l just spent several nights at Hotel Cestelli at the end of March and absolutely loved our stay. We have traveled throughout Italy and this was by far our favorite place. From the ambience, energy, decor and most friendly and helpful owners, Alessio and Assumi, we could not have had a more enjoyable stay. The room was perfect, large, extremely clean, the bed was nice and comfortable, plenty of blankets. The hotel has rooms with a private bathroom but we choose to share a bathroom which was fine for us as the bathroom was spotless, freshly tiled floor, clean shower. It was like taking a shower at your friends house, not some bathroom where you wish you brought a pair of flip flops. No one is more fussy, clean-freak than my wife and she was most pleased with it.Hotel Cestelli is a treasure that I am sure the word is spreading. The location is second to none as we were a 5 min walk from the Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio, basically the location is a short walk from most of the major attractions.Allesio, born in Florence and having lived in the US, perfectly fluent in English and his lovely wife, Assumi, an experienced traveler from Japan who also has lived in the US and speaks fluent English loved to share their favorite restaurants and places to go. They even give you a list of their favorite places for breakfast, lunch, dinner and shopping. Did I mention they even called and made reservations for us! Trust me, their restaurant picks are out of this world. We tried several of their picks and they too were probably the best we had in Italy.We could go on and on about Hotel Cestelli and our experience.

Staying in the Hotel Cestelli is a unique esperience, taking the traveler back in time to a previous era when one stayed in small family style hotels and felt like a person and not a number.

Some rooms have baths, others share a spotless large bathroom that is cleaned constantly. Yes, you do hear those motorcycles, but you hear them everywhere in this dynamic town. It quiets down after 11 PM. The owners are personable but not intrusive, and one of them is always there. You hand in your key to one of them when you go out, and they let you in by the buzzer outside and hand you your key when you enter. They live right there in a private area, so you are in a way a guest in their home. This was fine for me as a 72 year old single male, who likes the feeling that if I didn't return someone would come looking for me! The single room was spare, in an old Italian antique fashion, with huge ceiling and sink and bidet. It was abit dark, but one is rarely there except to sleep. It had a unique atmosphere. I enjoyed a number of meals at the excellent restaurant they recommmended nearby at really good prices. I loved the street it was on...very stylish and nice shops and friendly people. The owner got up at 6:15 am to help me into a waiting taxi for the train. All in, I would not hesitate to go back, and probably would pay abit more for a private bath.

We had heard the usual good words about this place, and so booked there for a couple of nights. In the end, it was ok, but had some odd elements that will probably keep us from returning. I guess you get what you pay for, which isn't saying the place was bad--for the cost it's probably the best deal in this area of Firenze (Florence?). But this is to say that the place is basically a massive full-floor flat that the owners have apparently divided into an inn. That might be a valid description of many inns, but in this case it resulted in some odd effects.First off, the place occupies the second floor of a tremendous five or six story apartment complex right in the heart of the old town. The building is one of many fine structures sandwiched along a cobbled road near the river that runs through town. And it's in a great location: just far enough from the huge cathedrals and Medici castle so that it's not thronged by the crowds (which never seem to dissipate--said fully aware that we constituted part of that infinite crowd during our stay). But everything in old Florence ends up being about a five or ten-minute walk away, so it's essentially near to everything. It's a fine location.The first oddity is that when you approach the place, you must ring a buzzer to be let in--because, again, this building is a residence in which other people live. Maybe not a big deal. Once you get into the inn, on the second floor, it's striking how beautifully appointed the place is: mild and tasteful medieval decor, with low lighting, and a general atmosphere that itself is almost worth the cost of the room. You'll feel like you're in a tranquil abbey just sitting by the innkeep's desk receiving your key. As every other review here attests, the couple running the place are indeed a fantastic pair: cordial, considerate, and quick to share names of places to eat and stroll. We tried all the eateries they suggested, and they were all fantastic (and all within a ten minute walk). And more: I was trying to find a particular place which neither of them had heard of, but the fellow, un-hesitating, got out a few books and in no time had located the place I was seeking. Again, very good hosts.Our room was massive (can't remember the number of the room). Almost too massive, if that makes sense. It was as if they'd placed a bed in a huge converted dining room; although of course I don't mean to say there was a table and settings; it was just an odd room to be sleeping in, probably not a bedroom in the flat's former incarnation. And here began the sense of being less in an inn, more a guest in someone's large and exquisite home. There was no phone in the room, no bedside clock, no television (and of course many will tsk tsk my mentioning this ommission...but frankly I like having the choice of watching the evening news or not, and don't appreciate inns that make this choice for me); and no air conditioning or fan. This last bit would be fine if you could sleep with the windows open, except that we tried doing this and the screenless windows resulted in a misquito-party buzzing around our ears through the night. The next night we kept the windows closed, and it was a bit tight with no circulation, even in a room so generous. There was a bed, a few chairs, and a wardrobe. It was elegant, and the bed was fine, but the room itself was...uncomfortable. It did, however, have a private bath, with a toilet, sink, full shower, and good supply of hot water.The key situation there is strange. You receive a skeleton key to your room...but you must return the key to the innkeeper whenever you step out. And so when you return to the hotel from wherever you've gone, you must get your key back from the innkeep in order to enter your room. It strikes me as being terribly inconvenient for the innkepper to have to constantly be on alert for guests in need of their keys, or in need of handing-in their keys. Now, the innkeeps were always nearby, and so we didn't have to wait at all for the key: but it was just odd that you continually had to hand the thing in and get it back. And you only receive a key to the building's front door if you're going to be out later than 10pm: before then, you must buzz for entry. Every time. The result is that we found ourselves not returning to the hotel as often as we might have, and staying inside sometimes instead of running down to the cornerstore as we might have, simply because of this odd key situation and the akward sense it imparts of being a bother if you were to need a series of in-and-out jaunts. The whole thing could be remedied by simply giving guests a set of front and room door keys to retain during their stay...as does every other hotel/inn I've ever visited. This place does not. It's an odd practice, and I can only guess it has something to do with the fact the inn is a flat in a residential building.I'm trying to balance a line here. One the one hand, the innkeeps do such a fine job and are so friendly, and their place is indeed stunning, so I don't want to discourage business. However, the things I've mentioned were just enough of a bother to us that I need to mention them, so that others who might find them similary bothersome will be aware. In the end, it's a question of whether the fantastic price for these rooms offsets the oddities. For me, it did not; for you, perhaps it does.", "Date": "Jun 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR325582384", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Simply Outstanding!

The location is hard to beat, right by the Arno and the Sta. Spirito Bridge, and adjacent to the most exclusive designer shops while situated in a quiet side street.

The location is fantastic (2 minutes to the Ponte Vecchio, 2 more to the Uffizi), the rooms are lovely and spacious, and spotlessly clean. But the best part is the hospitality shown by Alessio and Asumi, the charming young owners. Nothing is too much trouble for them. Before we travelled they had helped us with advice, and reserved a slot at the Uffizi for us (a must if you plan to go, because you totally avoid queueing). And then, when we got there and asked about somewhere for lunch, Alessio produced his own personal list of favourites and talked us through it, marking places up on a map, and even making reservations on our behalf. And these were out-of-the-way gems frequented by locals and tourists fortunate enough to have had advice from someone like Alessio. Like another reviewer our favourite was the Osteria Santo Spirito - a wonderful place we'd never have found by ourselves. My ravioli in a cream and lemon zest sauce was delicious, and the 'budino di panna' was to die for.If total tranquility is a must then the hotel is very central and therefore has traffic moving by. The rooms are double-glazed but you can hear some noise. On the other hand there is no noise from other rooms, partly perhaps because the rooms do not have tv's (hurrah). Also, if you are the kind of traveller who wants 5-star luxury, an in-house restaurant, and somewhere with spa facilities, go somewhere else. But if you value friendliness and warmth above formality, this is for you.So thank you Alessio and Asumi, and to the rest of you - look no further!", "Date": "Feb 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR437645394", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A&A_F-L"}, {"Content": "Charming hotel in location of amazing Florence       Lobby of Hotel Cestelli", "Date": "Jan 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR739878673", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "milica"}, {"Content": "Best Cheap and Charming Hotel in Florence       Room in Hotel Cestelli", "Date": "Jan 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR545261470", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Blacklisted"}, {"Content": "A Perfect Place to Stay! We stayed here for 8 nights and often spent our evenings sitting in the lobby talking with Alessio and Asumi about politics, restaurants and families. This was truely a home away from home.

The amazing thing is that of the 3 hotels we stayed in during our 10 days in Italy - Hotel Cestelli was only half the price per night of our other accommodations AND it was the best experience of all.Not only was the hotel quaint, intimate, centrally-located and spotless, but the owners Alessio and Asumi made sure our stay was truly authentic and wonderful. They gave excellent, authentic florentine restaurant recommendations at very fair prices, was always friendly and helpful in helping us plan our day and and in general were just wonderful hosts.We would definitely stay at Hotel Cestelli again.

Postives include close proximity to train station and city sights (all within walking distance); incredibly friendly and helpful staff; option to purchase bottles of water; safe neighbourhood; clean and nicely decorated rooms; and the unique, relaxing artistic atmosphere created by candlelight and incense throughout the hallway and reception area. Only negatives were the incredibly small shower and a difficult to use door lock.
