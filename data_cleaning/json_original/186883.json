Got the last spot in the parking tower which made it easier to get down (elevator). Drop off, pick up was fine. No concerns there. 330am pickup was within 5 minutes. The accomodations on the other hand, dreadful. The telephone agent indicated a continental breakfast which was not available. We did have a suite which was of great size. Had we stuck around, it's a good room. The facilities were not up to snuff though. The bedding was stale and hard. Either it had not been used in some time, or it was suffering from a lack of fabric softener. Comforter had holes in it, and there as hair all over the place. A smoke butt was clearly visible on the bathroom floor. The bathtub did not drain whatsoever, filling up during a shower and remaining at that level until we left. The walls were covered in mildew and mold was present. The hallway carpet was pungent to say the least. The room was very quiet considering it's location. We only stayed about 5 hours start to finish ; Slept little, and decided to bolt it home. When checking out, made mention of the bathtub to the attendant who seemingly did not care. Merely grinned without concern. If this has been renovated, I'm surprised. It was not sufficient at all and was a great surprise considering what I remembered.

We did notice a very strong smoke smell in the elevator, but if a guest is so inconsiderate as to smoke in the elevator, management can't be blamed. Obviously, they can't stand outside the elevators all day to catch the culprit. I suppose they could check during the night to see if any need airing out.

The employee who checked me in, and one who checked me out, were both very friendly and pleasant. The hotel has ample parking even though it had a sign signaling limited parking. I did not have a problem parking. My room was clean, comfortable, and nice looking. It was very loud in the hallway from 10pm on, but I didn't bother contacting the front desk. It didn't end up interupting my sleep. The beds are very very firm, and hard. The pillows are slim, kind of tough, and firm as opposed to big, fluffy and soft. I had trouble sleeping, and wished I'd brought my own pillow with me. There is no fridge, or microwave, which was not a huge issue, but I prefer to have that in my room. I used the hotel guide, from the desk in my room, to locate vending machines. I found the one on my floor was out of order, and ended up going to 5 different floors before finding a vending machine. Each floor that listed a machine didn't really have one. I found a machine on 2, i think it was floor 2, and the vending machine was empty but the drink machine was full. The drink machine has gatorate, and lipton, and water, no soda, and is very expensive. There was no free breakfast, and no continental breakfast at all. On the hotel's website they have a muffin symbol which indicates a continental breakfast. It'd be one thing to find out there is a charge attatched to the breakfast, but as a staff member told me in the morning \"there is no continental breakfast\". There was a restaurant menu for breakfast, and a buffet for $10. I was told, by a staff member, to go to the front desk to somehow get free breakfast vouchers that people had gotten. My mom went to the desk and came back empty handed. We ended paying $20 for breakfast at Perkins a few miles away. The computer in the business center was easy to access, right off the lobby, and comfortable, with a glass door that can close for privacy, but only one computer. The lobby is nice looking. I was able to book this choice hotel with points, so that it was free. I felt that for a free hotel room it was fine, but I was so bummed out over the breakfast mixup, and location(which i'll get to), that I would have been better off paying for a different hotel. The hotel is near the airport, so it might be fine for people flying in for a night. If you are spending time down town, at the Air Canada Center, the TIFF, AGO, or anything like that, you're way better off getting something located downtown. I was led to believe this hotel was a short distance, but it took forever, with heavy traffic, to get there from downtown, a 15 minute drive took, I'd say 45 minutes-over an hour at times. You have to leave really early if you have someplace to be at a specific time. So basically if you're passing through and need a place to stay, this would be an okay option except for the lack of free breakfast, and no help from that with the staff, but if you going to be spending time in Toronto, then stay elsewhere.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston, Canada", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely fantastic value for my dollar\u201d", "Author": "joenash", "ReviewID": "UR99476275", "Content": "my wife and i stayed there before we left on our honeymoon, it was our first time at a Quality, and it definitely will not be the last. any town we visit and we need to stay at a hotel, this will be our first choice and will be disappointed if there is not one in the town - the front desk staff were very friendly and very helpful - very clean halls and rooms - wife found the bed a little hard, it was good for me - airport shuttle quick and on time - 8 days of covered parking for free, thx Plain and simple unbeatable value for the money thank you very much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGood for a good sleep, not for luxury.\u201d", "Author": "Stan_Cooper", "ReviewID": "UR95798123", "Content": "I stay at the Quality Suites regularly between business trips, and I am satisfied with my experience there.

We appreciate the warm and hospitable services that we received while we were at the Quality Suites this time around. My father was especially impressed and that was important to us since we were celebrating his 71st birthday. We received a wonderful gift basket from management to help celebrate my dad's birthday. It made it that much more memorable! We realize that what happened on our trip last year may have only been a fluke, so it was nice to get a second chance to experience it better. It is so hard when you plan a vacation for months that you want to make sure everything is OK with all of the other preparations- especially when traveling with young kids or older people on a limited time-frame. The hotel is the last issue you want to think about. It should be the place to go for stress-free relaxation after a long day of running around with the family. Sometimes, you remember the hotel as much as the vacation-this is one of those times. Our stay at the Quality Suites was stress-free, comfortable and clean. We appreciate their reaching out to us and showing us their best and that they care. It's nice to know that management takes the comments into consideration whether they are good or bad and they find ways to make it better. The only thing we would recommend is that the television sets might need to be updated, but other than that, everything else was great! We have finally found a good hotel to visit every year when we go on vacation to the Toronto area and we will tell all of our friends about it.
