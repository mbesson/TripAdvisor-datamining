I'll try and review every place we managed to hit: We've always wanted to stay at the Admiral Fell Inn and took advantage of a groupon special to do so. I felt it was a very good value! Positive: History is alive and well here! We enjoyed the admiral's reception where this history was shared with us. All the staff members were very friendly. We had our dog with us and they greeted him each time he passed. Coffee/Tea/Muffins each morning was a nice touch we found only the second day but that muffin was out-of-this-world insanely good. The room was nice, I liked the old furniture and the overall decor. While I found some things to be a bit scruffed, it but me at ease a bit with our pooch (who had no incidents). Negative: Our room was right on the corner, streetside, right above the lobby and right off the elevator. My husband and I are one's to stay up late and not light sleepers, so I thought of anyone, we're probably the most ideal candidates for this type of room. We had a REALLY tough time sleeping, especially night one. It wasn't so much \"people\" and \"nightlife\" that kept us awake...it was cars and trucks and deliveries. Every car that drove by sounded exceptionally loud, like something was amplifying it. And starting EARLY in the morning, the sound of people making deliveries, opening/closing truck doors, the loading/unloading off stuff, pretty much unbearable (this was a Monday morning). The only thing I could suggest is perhaps some sort of white noise machine that people could request or maybe just have in rooms that are known to be noisier (ours was Jerome Bonaparte). The beds weren't so comfy either. Surprisingly, our dog didn't react to the outside noises, but he did react (bark) when he heard someone out in the hallway, and being right off the elevator that was frequent and hard to deal with. I don't know how full the hotel was but I think sticking us perhaps further tucked away with our pooch probably would have been the better choice. We gave our number to the front desk representative when we left the dog in the room alone. We got called 2 of the 3 times, the one time we were actually right in the hotel for the admirals reception and we never heard him at all and frequently kept checking (even trying to purposely make noise to just to test it out). The second time, they had me sign a pet policy and gave me a hang tag for my door which looks as if it should have been given to me at check in. I was given this after midnight of the day we were supposed to check out (so took the dog for a walk in the middle of the night and as I passed back through, they had me stop to fill it out). That felt a bit threatening to me like they had to get me to sign something so that they could charge me a check out for the earlier incidents. There was no additional charge at check out but it left a bad taste in my mouth like I was being punished for I think was a minor incident (they got a noise complaint, called me, and I came right back as I was just around the corner) While that seems like quite a bit more negative then positive, I loved my time at the Admiral Fell Inn and have already recommended to friends who are considering doing a similar stay-cation.

The upstairs has an interesting layout, with short ups and downs due to the combination of buildings that make up the hotel (not suitable for a disabled traveler). Our room with high ceiling was large enough to move around in, with hanging space for clothes and a little lobby of its own. Bed hangings were tastefully done but aging. The lightweight reproduction furniture was tired and worn, scuffed and chipped; the carpet was significantly stained. Bath was simple but adequate, mostly clean and the hairdryer worked. We arrived late and wanted a quick simple dinner, so asked for a bistro recommendation and were directed to a next door restaurant. It turned out to be a 'white tablecloth', full service restaurant associated with the hotel, which no one had mentioned.

Check in was quick and easy, and they were incredibly accommodating with our need to get into our room early because our flight arrived in the afternoon. I first realized I was in for a unique experience when I received an email from one of their representatives one week before my check-in date. He outlined all of the services available, including tickets to local attractions. We decided to take advantage of the Aquarium VIP tickets and it was well worth it. Also, the representative answered my questions promptly and completely. The room was amazing, very spacious and well furnished and we were fortunate enough to have a balcony! Admittedly it was a shared balcony, and we stayed in February, but it was still a nice touch. The location cannot be beat, we were steps away from some of the best dining, live music, and small shops - there was even a taxi stand right across the street. The only disadvantage of being in the center of Fells Point is the street noise, but that's to be expected in a city and the windows are thick enough to drown out all but the noisiest revelers.

After I made the reservation, I was asked if I wanted the \"Harbor Magic Specialist\" to call me prior to arrival to help with any excursions or dinner reservations. I set up an appointment, received a reminder email and was called right on time as requested. The \"Specialist\" , Bryce, was able to get me dinner reservations for six people, on the Saturday of Valentine's Day weekend, at a restaurant within walking distance of the hotel. It was fantastic. The hotel itself is beautiful. It is a historic property and Edgar Allen Poe was said to have been a regular in and around the hotel. It is within walking distance of every great Fell's Point bar and/or restaurant. The desk and valet staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful. There was live music in the lobby. Oh and I forgot to mention that the room was less than $140 (plus taxes and fees-about $30). It included the room, the Admiral's Reception (beer, wine and cheeses), a ghost tour if you'd like, a $25 restaurant voucher that can be used at 1/2 dozen local restaurants for dinner or breakfast, a $25 Gift Card towards a future stay, transportation to and from the cruise ship and valet parking (for up to eight days). Oh yeah and keep in mind that it would cost $105 to park your car at the harbor for the week. This place was a great find and I only wish I had known about it when my daughter was living in Baltimore. We would have visited her more often. We're definitely going back.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean City, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time!\u201d", "Author": "Cbot72", "ReviewID": "UR124989778", "Content": "Historic building with twisting hallways and charming rooms.

The rooms themselves are kept spotless. The room furnishings are comfortable and while not overly opulent, are still simple and elegant. As with any older hotel, you do get a bit of hallway noise; the hallways are well-carpeted to cut down, but you can occasionally hear your neighbors talking in the halls or slamming doors. The noise doesn't seem to travel between rooms, just from the hallways into the room, and it's not extreme, but I di want to mention it as some folks are sensitive to that kind of thing. The staff is consistently friendly and helpful; however, it is a small staff, so allow adequate time for check-in/check-out, especially if you need the valet services or if you're checking out right at noon along with everyone else. The valet parking is a bit pricey by Baltimore standards so if budget is an issue, there are several public garages about 3 blocks away which may be more affordable. The neighborhood is quite historic, with lots to do, but is also the big \"nightlife\" district of Baltimore; if you are staying over a weekend, especially during nice weather, there will be a lot of partiers on the street.

There was a city-wide power outage, so it was kind of a mess. The gentlemen at the front desk were so kind though. Everyone was very helpful. The hotel was decorated for Christmas. Very nice for photos! The fireplace was going when we showed up. One day we came down and there was a violinist playing. Our room had two beds, a desk area, and a great view of the city (which was a problem at night, because of the noise). It was not super clean, but it was clean. The carpets looked old and dirty, the tub filled with water while I showed, so I ended up standing in water...Yuck. Along with the power outage, the phones were not working. I had a cell phone, so it wasn't a big deal. I would recommend this place for mature couples who are still looking for a good time. I say mature because of all the old furniture and good time because of all the local nightlife. The location is wonderful. Right around the corner to the right is the famous bar The Horse You Came in On. To the left is the central area where music and snacks are available. Down the street to the left are all the nice restaurants. Across the street is the pier taxi's that take you all over town.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pgh", "Title": "\u201cDirty Rooms\u201d", "Author": "Pinot2011", "ReviewID": "UR121143139", "Content": "This was my first experience in Inner Harbor and probably my last.

Although it wasn't our first choice, overall we enjoyed our stay. The location in Fells Point is both a positive and a negative. On the plus side, you are close to restaurants and bars and in the heart of this little historic district. The hotel does a nice job with their wine/beer and cheese happy hour which features a costumed storyteller who offers historical accounts of life in Fells Point from its founding onward. The tiny lobby actually becomes a bit of a party with the storyteller bringing the disparate group together with her tongue-in-cheek/somewhat satirical , but historically accurate delivery. The hotel also is attached to a well-reviewed tapas restaurant where we had a drink pre-happy hour (starts at six.) On the negative side, the location in Fells Point is noisy. We were awoken at 3 am when the bars let out to screaming, laughing and I swear someone was playing a saxaphone.... And this was mid-week! I can't imagine what a weekend night would be like. Our room did face the street on the third floor so there may be quieter, higher floor options. The area also feels a bit dangerous, which didn't stop us from walking to dinner across the square, but was reinforced the next morning when we were having breakfast at the Fells Point market on the square surrounded, I kid you not, by a parade of at least seven policeman in full swat team gear (bullet proof vests etc). The rooms at the Inn are on the older side with tiny out-of-date bathrooms, but the bed was comfy and the free water bottles were appreciated after the generous happy hour.

Room was ready and generally clean...though dirty in some nasty ways--chunks of some substance adhered to end table, smears on wall. sink and tub that didn't drain properly. Used the $25 voucher we received at check-in at one of their two restaurants--which turned out to be a mistake. Very pricey for the quality, slow service and dark atmosphere. Things really went down hill from here. I had a 6 AM report time at the hospital. The 5 AM wake-up call we requested never came...were told no one answered... they didn't see fit to send someone to the room to knock on the door. Turns out that the phone was defective....it was replaced, but the replacement also turned out to be defective. This made communicating from the hospital challenging to say the least. My wife returned to spent the night at the hotel while I stayed overnight in the hospital. She found that her room had not been cleaned at all. The desk gave her another diner voucher as an appology. She ordered diner but her order was seeingly never placed and when she inquired as to why patrons who had arrived after her were served and she was not, the waiter had no answer other that that he would check. He returned shortly with what she descibed as a raw piece of meat. She left. The hotel's reponse was to send a glass of champagne and three desserts to our room. Which seems to me to be a bizzare response to the problem. The hotel seemed pretty nice in many ways and the attitude of almost all employees we interfaced with in dealing with the problems we sincere and appologetic. While thankful to those who tried to correct or compensate for the difficulties we encountered---they deducted $50 from our final bill--I would never stay at this hotel or any of its related properties.

But parking on the street was $2 an hour and there are several garages near the hotel but not really within a reasonable distance from the hotel if you are lazy and don't want to walk a block or two. We used valet this time but If we stayed again would definitely carpool. The other problems we had were temperature, trash, vending, and handicapped related. We had our air on high and max cool and it wasn't very cold. I know this could be related to the age of the building but it was cooler outside than in our room and I know when it is summer that we would have had major complaints had we stayed later in the year. Also the trashcans need to be bigger all around. My group had the run of most of the 5th floor and the rooms there were warm and overflowing with trash There needed to be larger trashcans in the conference rooms and the main rooms. We had to leave extra bags full of trash because we filled up the room and bathroom cans. I went to get ice from the 2nd floor and the room with the vending area smelled really bad. I'm not sure if it was mold, mildew, or some sort of pipe issue.

The view was not very good, but we were not there for that and therefore I did not mind. Our room was very quiet and we both slept so good.

The historical value (we stayed in the Frederick Douglass room) and preservation of the building is incredible here.

The Fells Point area is also loaded with great bars and restaurants (you MUST go to Bertha's Mussels if you find yourself here!!!). This hotel is also part of the Harbor Magic group, which runs a lot of promotions... I entered a photo from my trip into a contest and won a voucher for a free night at the hotel for a later date! The room was super roomy and comfortable for being in such an old building. The king size bed was great, loved the mattress. The bathroom was nothing special, but it was fine. The TV was in a weird spot (to the side of the bed, and kind of close to it as well) but not a big deal. The staff at the Admiral Fell is probably the NICEST PEOPLE EVER. Seriously, I can't say enough things about how much I loved the staff here, they were so helpful and FRIENDLY! Being from Boston, I was kind of shocked that such nice people even exist in customer service. The staff alone is reason enough for me to want to go back. They answered all my questions, went out of their way to be courteous and helpful, and not once did I feel like I was inconveniencing them. We checked in close to midnight and had no problem whatsoever. If I had any complaints about this hotel, it would be the parking situation. It's a little rough in this area, but there is street parking if you know the rules (ask a staff member!), and there are garages pretty close by that aren't too outrageously priced. I wouldn't expect a full parking lot in a historical neighborhood like this anyway though, so I wasn't surprised. We never had trouble finding a place to park, it was just sometimes more convenient than other times. Another complaint I had was that we had one particularly loud neighbor one night, and their TV had to have been on full volume up until 2-3am. However, when we called the front desk to see if they could ask our neighbors to dial it down, I did hear their phone ring shortly after, and their volume did get turned down after that.

My good experience with this place started even BEFORE we got there. Kimber, my Harbor Magic Experience Specialist, was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to planning my trip. She recommended restaurants, told us about parking and was very prompt in getting back to me when I had questions about anything. We arrived at the hotel. Though its in the heart of Fell's Point, near the bars, its not close enough to where you'd hear any riff raff. We don't like riff raff. We were greeted by Dorian, a very professional front desk person. He took care of us, ensuring that the feather pillows I wanted were in the room when I arrived. We got to the room and it was so nice! This hotel has so much charm and character! Each of the rooms has a name and a story behind it. It was a spacious room with a very comfy bed. The bathroom had its requisite soaps and shampoos and such and they were actually good products. Kimber had sold me on a gift certificate to go to one of their restaurants. $40 for $50 worth of food. Not a bad deal. So I did it. We went to Pizzazz. Bad deal. Experience was so terrible that we only got $29 worth of food, making the certificate pointless. I called back to the hotel and told them about that so they could take the certificate off my bill. They were all so nice! Dorian handled the situation like a pro! Wait, it gets better. Because of my situation with the restaurant, Dorian and Hakeem gave me a $50 certificate to the hotel for the next time I wanted to come back. I was impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the overall look and feel of the hotel.

My wife had a day long appointment at Johns Hopkins. We did quite a bit of research online trying to find a nice place to stay, since we have had our share of not so great experiences at some \"high end\" hotels. We actually decided to stay at the Admiral Fell Inn for 3 nights and take some time to see the area after our research uncovered some areas of interest around there. After our 8 hour drive, I was hoping for the best. As we pulled up to the Valet, which we had already expected to pay for, the valet told us that the open space behind us (right in front of the hotel) was a metered space that only needed 2 more hours until the hours were over and that would save me quite a bit for that night alone. This was the beginning of a wonderful stay. he unloaded our vehicle and quickly headed to our room. At check in, the host quickly got us going as he could see that we were tired. He gave a couple of quick suggestions and we headed to the room with high hopes again. We were in the 'Smith' room (395). We opened the door to find a very graciously sized room with a quite alley view (which we requested). With huge smiles on our faces, we rested up for a couple of hours. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were clean and of good quality. That evening we headed out for a bit to eat and didn't have to go far to find a lot of great choices. Throughout our stay, the host was very informative of great places to eat and great things to do. He didn't only recommend the typical \"tourist\" spots, but recommended some great local establishments that we were very pleased by. He also helped us save a lot of time and money with the various deals that he was able to get us through the connections that the hotel has. The connected Meli Restaurant had some wonderful pastries each morning and Jimmy's Diner across the court had a great diner breakfast. I have to say that of all the hotels that we have stayed at though our years of travel, due to the service, area, and accommodations this stay honestly ranks up there with some of the resorts that we have paid 5 times as much to stay at! We are already looking forward to future trips to the area. Also, if you are traveling to the area with your four legged friends, make sure you find out about the offerings. We boarded our dog for our trip. If we had known how pet friendly this area was beforehand, we surely would have brought him with us!

My husband and baby travelled with me. The hotel advertises that no two rooms are alike. True, because each room is painted a completely different color of whatever cheap paint was on sale at the hardware store. My room was painted cotton candy pink. Others were neon green, purple, etc. Their was a hole in my wall. Windows were painted shut. Tiles were loose on the bathrrom floor. the carpet was stained and very dirty. The desk chair was broken. Basically, this was Motel 6 caliber for a higher price. I called in advance to ask about a crib and rocker and was assured they'd have both waiting for me. I asked that they notifiy me if they weren't available so I could bring my own. I received no notificaion, and surprise...no rocker or crib when I got there. Upon check in, the desk clerk was incredibly rude. Borderline obnoxious. She was about 20 and clearly had her mind elsewhere, as was demonstrated when her boyfriend meandered in to ask when she could take a lunch break. This was far from the worst of it. Some of the other reviews mention how quiet it is...SO WRONG! 100% of my coworkers had problems sleeping because of the two busy streets and because of the bar that is on the backside of the hotel. That covers the 4 sides of the building, so there is no way to get away from the noise. Not only did I not sleep, but neither did my baby! Sadly, this is still not the worst of it. I was playing on the floor with my baby, in our room, when a mouse crawled out into the middle of the room and simply watched us. As my husband got near him, he didn't run. He didn't budge. Later as I walked downstairs to a work mtg, there was yet another mouse in the hall! Still not the worst part. At dinner in the hotel, one mouse was seen crawling out from the buffett table and another climbed onto the desert table! the next day, my boss reported a mouse in his room . Yes, I understand that old buildings have mice, etc. but this was a rodent INFESTATION. More importantly, it was clear that the hotel was doing nothing about the problem and the mice clearly were not afraid of humans and had been there some time.

The Inn itself was quiet, though, we elected for an interior room to help ensure a good night's sleep. One annoying thing was that housekeeping knocked on our door as early as 8am. When we asked them to come back, they left our door unlatched, and we were reawakened by a helpful neighbor who informed us that our door was not secured. The front desk staff (Rachel) was perfunctory. I would not stay at Pier 5. We went in a few times to call the shuttle. The lobby is strangely decorated and oddly vacant. I don't think I ever saw anyone at the front desk. One evening we attempted to eat at their Tuscan Grill. It was about 9pm on the Sunday before Labor Day. We were ignored for several minutes until someone begrudgingly greeted us. Despite the live music and full deck, the waitress seemed to plead with another staff member to turn us away because the kitchen was closing in 30 minutes. When she was told to seat us, she threw one menu (there were two of us) on a table without word or even looking back to see if we had followed her. That set enough of a tone, and we left without ordering food. Again fate smile upon us and we ended up at Talara and had a thoroughly great experience at a place that appreciated our patronage. All said and done, there are benefits to staying at a Harbor Magic property, but I'd suggest avoiding Pier 5. The Admiral Fell is nice but I doubt it's terribly kid friendly, nor is the location. For couples or singles, I think it's fine. FYI the Hilton Garden Inn has the same MAC benefit.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tifton, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA perfect place for a wedding, we had wonderful service, a great reception\u201d", "Author": "TerryAnn059", "ReviewID": "UR78041686", "Content": "\"A class act\" This hotel lived up to seventy out of town guests requirements not one complaint to the Mother of the Bride.

There were hairs everywhere in the bathroom, and through-out the room. There was a humongous stain on the love seat couch, and when I turned it over there were more stains on the other side. The room to my opinion needs to be repainted everywhere, getting rid of the marks on all of the walls and also change the color from the hideous pink. The Internet was not working the entire time we were there and after calling the front desk asking why we could not enjoy a movie from your Admiral Fell Inn channel she just said to try it again a little later, which later must have been after we left.

The price the website submitted to us was $251 and some odd cents, making our room rate $209 + tax, the bill showed it as $239 + tax.

The location is excellent, and the hotel is beautiful and clean. Some of my guests were placed in rooms that they described as extremely small, loud, and containing broken furniture, but once they asked to be switched all was taken care of promptly. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The planner assigned to me for the wedding (\"Catering Manager\") Christina was helpful and always responded to my quesitons in a timely manner. Now for the bad parts. We were given a package with many free perks which seemed wonderful at first until they never quite materialized. Our guests were to recieve gift baskets in each room, but only the guests arriving the day of the event recieved them. I had previously asked if early arrivers would recieve them too and was told yes, but it never happened. On the day of the event the ceremony went well and we set up correctly. For the actual reception the \"Bridal Hostess\" that I was supposed to have never showed up. The banquet staff was rude and not helpful. The banquet staff even went as far as trying to hurry me into cutting the cake early even though a schedule had previously been established. The food was not nearly as good as the tasting we had sat for. A lot of the food came out of the kitchen late, not everything was out when I went to get my plate. We were given a free breakfast for up to 20 guests. I even paid (quite a steep price) to add 10 people to this event. When I got there there was no food left to eat, and from what I understand when there was food there it was quite slim in choice (Only bagels, chocolate chip scones and coffee and tea). There is no way that they included enough food for the amount of people I paid extra for. After the event I have discovered many billing problems. There was an over charge of $800 that I had to dispute at length with the hotel to resolve, something that they ended up calling a small decimal point error. I'm not sure about you but to me an $800 error is huge. Now even a month after the event I am still trying to work out other billing mistakes. It makes me very sad that all of these bad things turned my wedding reception experience with the hotel into somewhat of a nightmare. All in all the event was just ok, but the headaches I am still trying to deal with now are driving me crazy. Imagine if I had not looked so thoroughly at the bill, I would easily be paying them $1,000 over what should have been charged. Very disappointing the hotel is so cute, and I really thought everything would be wonderful going into this : ( I would love to go back and stay as just a guest, but I'm not sure I should be giving them business at this point.

All four of us stayed at the Admiral Fell Inn, in two separate rooms. The hotel is historic so if you are looking for modern amenities like a fridge or microwave in the room, a fitness center or a pool, this is not the place for you. The Inn is lacking an important amenity that you will notice as soon as you check in - a bell person/valet to help with your bags. When checking in, you have to pull up to the front of the hotel and leave your car while you go inside and look for someone to take it and park it for you. There are also three steps leading up to the hotel lobby. I had to drag my suitcases up these steps - no one was around to offer assistance. Also, because there are no hotel staff outside to greet guests, panhandlers come right up to you - even if you are standing right in the doorway - to ask for money. This happened to me twice in two days. It was the same person both days, and he became rude and pushy the second time asking me for money. I've been to Baltimore before and was prepared to deal with panhandlers, but you want to experience a feeling of safety in and around your hotel. I feel that if they have a door person or valet, it may deter panhandlers from harrassing hotel guests so brazenly. These first turn offs were not too big of a deal, but what I found in the hotel room was more of a problem. Like most people, the first thing I do when I enter a hotel room is check the carpet, sheets, towels, bathroom, etc for cleanliness. Our sheets had several small bloodstains on them. When I went back down to the lobby, I asked the concierge to have housekeeping change the sheets. When we returned to our room later that evening, the top sheets had been changed, but the fitted sheet had not - and this sheet had a visible stain on it. I reluctantly slept on the soiled sheet, and the next morning, we left a note for housekeeping to please change the fitted sheet because it was stained. We left a few dollars tip along with the note. Sadly, when we returned to our room later that day, the fitted sheet had not been changed. This was incredibly frustrating, so the next day, we did not leave a tip for housekeeping. On our last day at the hotel, we passed two of the hotel maids as they were cleaning the room next to ours. My husband heard them complain in Spanish about how we had not left them money the previous morning. I found this unbelievable, not only because they assumed we could not understand them, but also because they expected a tip for below-average service. To me, a clean room is an absoulte must when travelling. The lack of cleanliness in this hotel is a deal-breaker for me. It is a shame because the Admiral Fell Inn is in a wonderful location and has a lot going for it. But I would not stay there again, nor would I recommend that anyone else stay there.

They also very kindly explained to me how exactly to get a taxi. What can I say, we seriously don't take taxi's where we live. The room was actually good sized considering the age of the hotel. Now let me say that the hotel is old...if you don't like old, you may not like the hotel. However, we thought it was adorable and had tons of history. We didn't tell our 5 year old about the \"haunting\" part until the morning after. She promptly asked the front desk staff about it and they gave her a very age appropriate \"ghost story\" that she just loved. With the cruise and stay, you get a taxi voucher and the staff calls you a taxi. I have to recommend asking for Leroy at Baltimore Taxi (that's the service they use)... he was totally awesome. Picked us up from the cruise and had us back to the hotel (even called to make sure our car would be ready) in lightening speed. My only recommendation is this...realize that Fell's Point is party central...our room faced the road and it was a Sat. night. We heard EVERY band in EVERY bar in a 2 block area. But as soon as last round was called, it became very quiet. We were so excited about our cruise we couldn't sleep anyway so we just stayed up and enjoyed the music.

I return again and again for several reasons. The main reason is the location - right on the historic old harbor at Fells Point - is fantastic because interesting shops and good restaurants abound in the area. In addition, I was born in Fells Point. Once a working class community of Poles, Greeks and Italians, it has become a smart and trendy historically protected district attracting tourists from around the world. The next reason is the charming decor and great service and attention I always receive. The rooms are nicely appointed and very clean. A roomy clothes armoire also held an ironing board and a really good iron in addition to a large flat-screened TV. There are good options for things to do, from walking to Little Italy and its fantastic restaurants, to driving downtown and up Charles Street and exploring Mount Vernon Place and the Washington Monument. Further north, you can discover the Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus and the gorgeous nearby neighborhoods of Guilford and Roland Park or funky Hampden, where you will see people much like those in the movie \"Hairspray\"! Back in Fells Point, I enjoyed a lunch of crabcakes, fries and fresh coleslaw at Duda's on Bond Street near the hotel. The food was very good, but the wait was inordinately long and the young waitress who served me seemed to feel she was worth both the visit and the wait. She wasn't. Nevertheless, I recommend Duda's for its neighborhood flavor (it was in operation when I was still in grade school back in the '50s). Dinner at Meli (adjacent to the hotel) was nice, trendy young waiters dressed in black shirts and pants, nice modern yet warm decor, and a small but adequate menu of chicken, fish and meat entrees.

Based on the historic nature of the building and on the extra \"in-house\" activities offered, we selected the Admiral Fell Inn. First, the good news. Our room was clean and comfortable, and we both enjoyed the Jacuzzi. Before I get to the bad news, I am wondering if a community fair might have affected the service we received. However, since no one thought it was worth mentioning the fair when we booked our room, I have to assume it was not considered a significant issue. 1. The \"Valet service\" involved driving our own car to a public garage and then schlepping our stuff six blocks to the hotel. For this service, we were charged $29 plus tax. (We later learned that there is a quicker route, which would have involved walking only four blocks.) 2. One of the \"in-house\" activities which drew us the the AFI, the Tea Party, was cancelled with no notice. 3. The other \"in-house\" activity which we wanted to attend was the Ghost Tour. It was scheduled from 5-6. At 5:20, we gave up and left. The front desk could not tell us when, or even if, the tour would take place. 4. Our smoke detector was \"chirping\" at regular intervals (as when the battery is low). We called the front desk and were told that someone would come take care of it. No one ever did. 5. The web site shows a \"breaksfast room\" and a menu featuring omelettes and quiches. Evidently, this has been discontinued and replaced with a \"breakfast buffet\". The buffet consists of two chafing dishes, one containing scrambled eggs, the other containing potatoes and bacon. This is generally included in the room fee, but since we booked with AAA discount, we would have been charged $11/person for this meal. (When the front desk manager saw us leaving to go to a diner, he comped our breakfast.) 6. We found our room to be very noisy. We could hear people outside our third floor room at 3am. (It seems there are a number of bars and taverns in the area.) We commented, with no irony or sarcasm, that we've spent much quieter nights at Times Square. Ear plugs helped some.

There were no ghosts to be found during my stay, and I can\u2019t say that I blame them; even if I were dead, I\u2019m not so sure I would want to hang around there either. While the Inn itself is beautifully steeped in an old-fashioned, unassuming charm, from its dimly lit, Federal-style lobby to its sprawling red-carpeted corridors that would make Stephen King drool with envy, the rooms themselves are products of age and what can only be constituted as human neglect. Upon entering the room, my husband and I were assaulted by the overwhelming scent of mustiness, reminiscent of a dank basement. It wasn\u2019t hard to see why. The air vents were literally caked in solidified layers of dust and grime, the ceiling was marred by signs of water damage, and the shower was a ghastly display of mold and mildew. Allergy suffers beware: if you are staying here, come prepared with an arsenal of decongestants. I take pleasure in the simple things in life, like long, hot showers during my vacation. So you can imagine my utter horror when I see that the very shower/tub that I am supposed to be enjoying is grossly stained and spotted with the browns and reds of mildew, with the occasional random hair strewn about (do ghosts shed? I don\u2019t think so). Now, part of the appeal at staying at the Admiral Fell Inn was so that I could fall in love with the charisma and uniqueness of someplace historically charming, instead of staying at your run-of-the-mill, sterile hotel chain. However, after one look at the shower, I wanted to run into the awaiting arms of the local Marriott or Holiday Inn, because at least there I would have been practically guaranteed a hot shower that wouldn\u2019t involve a hazmat suite. I had hoped that a good night\u2019s sleep would help turn my frown upside down, though I worried that my night would be plagued by nightmares about killer mold spores. I never got the chance to find out. Sleep was sparse because of conversational neighbors congregating in the hallway all hours of the night, and though they weren\u2019t especially loud, the walls are so paper-thin that they might as well have been carrying on their conversations beside my bed. I was even awakened by the sound of a woman\u2019s cackling laughter a few doors down. A crazy ghost, maybe? My money\u2019s on an obnoxious drunk in need of attention. You can imagine how hard it is to enjoy Fells Point/Inner Harbor on just a few hours sleep. The one saving grace of the Inn, however, is the location. Everything you could want is at your fingertips, be it good food and drinks, quaint shops, or in my case, water-taxis (I was sleep deprived, so walking everywhere would have been a dangerous to my person). The proximity of all the tourist attractions was definitely a plus, and though tired, I enjoyed all of the sights and sounds of the area and the people. Another saving grace? The staff at the Inn were exceptionally sweet and personable and always willing to make you smile. Even if they were oblivious to the state of the rooms they represent, they were a pleasure to work with. We were informed, upon leaving after a night\u2019s stay, that the Inn was undergoing some updating. I hope this wasn\u2019t just a line. The Inn has so much potential to be a historical and pleasant place to stay. With a little work, it could easily be polished into the shining gem of Fells Point. All it would take would be some hard work, a little creativity, and a lot of Tilex.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somewhere else", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay and great location\u201d", "Author": "GIfishguy99", "ReviewID": "UR34558277", "Content": "I stayed here with my wife as a getaway.

I asked about family-friendliness of the hotel, the area, restaurants etc... We were taking my daughter for an over night trip to go to Port Discovery the next day. I was told that the hotel had a great restaurant Meli, that was very child friendly. I was also told that they would accommodate my request for a room with a nook or sitting area so that my husband and I didn't have to go to bed as early as our daughter. Got there and went to room. The room smelled like disinfectant. The carpet was FILTHY. There were large brown stains and it crunched when we walked on it. THe room was set to about 80 degrees as well. We went downstairs to go to dinner and before going to the restaurant, I was asked by the front desk how everything was. I told them about the room and they immediately gave me keys to a different room. Went to Meli. There was a 30 minute wait (after being told by the hotel we didn't need a reservation on a Monday night). Was sent to their sister restaurant ,Mezze down the street where it took them 20 minutes to bring a glass of wine. This doesn't work when you have a two year old with you - and we were assured Mezze was child friendly as well. We got back and went to the second room. Also dirty. Mold on ceilings in bathroom. Dust on the night tables. Cob webs on the lap shades. Ugh! The room was right off of Thames Street.

This hotel has the right intentions when you first come into contact with staff. Once you enter BEWARE! They are not what they advertise on line, in their pictures, on the phone orin their restaurants. They really need a complete over haul. Meli and Mezze's management should be replaced. They need lessons in how to recruit wait staff. Every wait person we encountered was either unfriendly and/or looked past us as if we didn't exist. I'm not sure why they told us they were child friendly. I enjoy dinners without kids as much as the next person. But why the false advertising? To make more money?

There were some really cool points about locale which includes the funky flavor of Fell's Point itself as well as the quaint facade of the Inn. I can also say that every person at the Inn was very friendly and helpful. That being said let's move on to the not so good moments. First off, we tried to check in and our reservation wasn't in the system so we had to wait 20 minutes for them to enter us in manually. This wasn't a problem since we came early but beware if you're on a tight schedule. The staff member that helped us was very apologetic and gave us a large room as compensation for our waiting. We grabbed our things and went to the third floor triping over small flights of steps along the way. We ended up in the POE room which seemed like an awesome start to the weekend. The room was tastefully decorated in 18th century furniture accented in nautical colors of forest green, navy and beige. The tv was a desent size and the heater was mercifully quiet. Unfortunately, the closer I looked at things the grungier it looked. The walls have smears and battle scars from from previous furniture arrangements, the bathroom's plaster is cracked and peeling, the bathtub wasn't exactly sparkling but what bothered me the most was that the sheets were clearly not changed. There were short and curly hairs in the bed and they weren't from us! That completely grossed me out and then I noticed that my comforter was torn and ragged. I just let it go figuring that I was being paranoid. The first night we opted to take their shuttle service to the city and was greeted by a van covered in tacky stars and driven by a very sweet man who was NOT a great driver. Those with a faint heart better skip this ride! Anyway, we woke up the next morning and was greeted by a bill for an adult movie that we didn't order. We contested the bill and it was quickly waived but we started to wonder if they tried to charge everyone that bogus bill in the hopes that some people will pay it. As for the 9.95 destination fee. Pretty sneaky but we weren't terribly put off by it. We used the shuttle and bottled water so I'm sure it shook out. I'm just really appalled at the lack of cleanliness.

Our initial room was a corner one that was quite tiny . . .think about hotel rooms in Europe. As we ran into each other trying to get our suitcases in the room, and stared at the carpet (which looks about 20 years old . .brown, stained, and ugly), we realized that there appeared to be no heat in this room (this is December and it was freezing.!) After complaining to the management and asking to be moved to another room, we were told there were no other rooms and that someone would be over to \"fix\" the problem. As the temperature in our room hovered around 50 degrees, we decided to go the bar as we waited for the repairman. The one positive thing we had was a lovely \"experience\" concierge, who was kind and upbeat and our drinks were comped by her (unknown to us, for I would have definitely had more than 1 cocktail if I had known what was ahead.). However, after 2 hours of waiting, we still had no heat in our room. We were then offerred the opportunity to move to their sister hotel, and the shuttle would take us there. We packed up our things and hustled over to the the Pier six (5?) hotel, which is right on the water. As we walked into the hotel and were greated by the loud beat of techno music, I honestly felt like I was in the tackiest hotel in Las Vegas. This hotel is very modern, the walls are purple with orange accents and you feel like you're in a Jetsons episode. Yes, the room had heat and was much larger, but for someone like me who goes for that whole \"Williamsburg\" vibe, it was terrible. So, after checking into this hotel, we told the desk clerk that we would like to return to the Admirel Fell Inn for the next evening . . that is, if they could give us a room with heat. So, we packed up our things once again and went back to the Admirel Fell Inn for our Saturday night stay. The room we stayed in was a very small suite, but once again, it is quite dated and oddly decorated. The drapes and bedspread looked like something out of a Motel 6, we had that same brown, seedy carpet, but most surprising, the walls in this room were painted a bubblegum pink! The bathroom had a mixture of gold and nickel fixtures, but there was a decent sized television which still does not compensate for the quality of the furnishings. What was most amazing to me is that no one acted like this was an unusual occurrence, i.e. checking into a room with no heat in December, being shuttled to another hotel after a 2 hour wait, and shuttling back again for another night. Although there appeared to be staff, they did not offer to help with our bags, there was no complimentary parking, basically nothing for our troubles. Would I ever come back here again?

It is a historic hotel-if you like to stay at places that have a lot of history behind them and evoke a sense of days gone by, then the Admiral Fell Inn does not dissappoint. Our room was spacious, clean, tastefully decorated, and super comfortable. 2. Pet friendly. We were able to bring along our beloved golden retriever for the weekend. The staff was so complimetary and made sure that we, as well as our dog, had a great time. Upon check in, our dog recieved his own pet pack complete with a toy, food and water dish and other things. We really didn't need it since the dog already has everything he needs when we travel but it was included in the price and we plan on donating it to a local rescue group. The Admiral Fell is located in historic Fells Point. This is a great, historic neighborhood complete with cobblestone streets, quaint bars and resteraunts and tons of history. The ghost walk was a great way to learn about the history and see some of the main landmarks.

The bars and restaurants in Fells Point offer a good mix of tourist and local folk whereas the Inner Harbor is more crowded and mostly with tourists.

This \"destination fee\" gets you internet access, US phone calls, and some other stuff for a flat rate of $9.95/night. They advertise it on flyers in the room as though it's an optional package but it's not. While it may be a good deal for some, we didn't need any of it and disputed the charges on check-out. The clerk explained to us it's not an optional charge and it's applied to all their rooms.

The registration process should have given me a clue. While I could look up availability on-line, I had to call to actually make the reservation.

The very reason there is street noise, though, is the very thing that makes this a very convenient place to stay: It's right in the middle of where you want to be! I'm not much of a walker, so this was a great choice since it's only steps from a water taxi stop. There is a cute little park across the street and many cute little shops within walking distance (including ice cream - yay!) The negatives: The pillow shams were like you would find in someone's guest room, and I was a bit afraid to put my head on them since they don't look like the type of thing that would get washed after every guest. (There were 3 pillows in regular white pillow cases, though, so it was ok.) Also, there was a little stain on one of the bath towels which creeped me out. Not the world's best water pressure in the shower, but it was clean. The positives (which more than made up for the negs): The staff is WONDERFUL! There are afternoon tea parties complete with amusing \"ghost\" hosts. The valets are always ready to get your car at a moment's notice. The breakfast was delicious and served in a charming room very unlike at a chain motel where you eat crammed into some lobby. Would I return? Absolutely - just don't forget earplugs or a noise machine if you're staying anywhere in Inner Harbor and you'll have a great time.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cwonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "luvtotravelNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR15396881", "Content": "let me start by saying that the hotel is beautiful.

The valet will take your car to a nearby parking garage, but won\u2019t be too happy if you need your car often, because he will have to walk 4 blocks every time to get it. There are 3 or 4 spots in front of the hotel where you can wait for the valet, but if it\u2019s busy and the spots are full, you are out of luck until the valet finishes his 4 block walk. Be aware, valet ends at 10pm, so if you\u2019re out late, you have to find a spot all on your own; good luck, because there are 40 bars in the area which of course are open until 2am. Note, parking on meter spots around the area is free from 8pm-10am and the hotel does have a shuttle that can take you around Baltimore for free. The valet is also the bell hop, so if he\u2019s on his walk, be ready to take your bags to your room yourself or wait for him. If you\u2019re not paying for a fancy room, you won\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll get a small room that just fits all the furniture and doesn\u2019t have enough space for all your things. And to add on, the walls are paper thin, so be prepared to hear loud guests and barking dogs, after all the hotel is pet friendly. The hotel has two wonderful employees, who refer to themselves as the ghosts of the hotel. These two are very entertaining and helped make the trip more enjoyable. The hotel has a bar downstairs that is open to public and stays quiet and relaxed, if that is what you\u2019re looking for. The breakfast buffet is decent, especially if you booked the business reservation which comes with breakfast coupons, otherwise its $25 for two. If you\u2019re heading out to the Aquarium, you can purchase the tickets through the hotel and receive VIP entry to the Aquarium (no wait). On your way out the door you are handed a bill with breakfast charges that were supposed to be free and valet parking charges for days you didn\u2019t use valet.

This is a very unique, quaint inn located at Fell's Point in Baltimore. It is very nicely appointed with period furnishings. It is certainly clean and well maintained. Every afternoon, there is tea in the lobby with characters sharing stories from the inn's history. Unfortunately, when in town on business, you never get the chance to enjoy this. By the time I arrived back at the inn after 5:30, most of the surrounding shops had closed, though I did still manage to find some excellent crabcakes nearby, and there was a Maggie Moo's right across the street for dessert! Parking is available by valet, or you can park about a block away in a public garage, which I chose. My only complaints are the following. First, there is no on-site excercise facility, which I desire, especially when traveling alone. They did shuttle me to one of their sister hotels, where there was a small workout room with some cardio equipment. After exercising, I had to wait 30 min for the shuttle back to the Admiral Fell, and had to ride on this shuttle with other people who probably didn't appreciate my post-workout state. Second, I was charged for valet parking even though I didn't use it. This matter was corrected, but only on my insistence that I didn't use the service. Third, there is a \"convenience\" charge of $10 per day which includes their wireless internet, phone, and bottled waters. I raised a little stink about this since I didn't have a computer with me, I used by cell phone exclusively, and I even brought my own cooler of drinks. They did remove the charge, but reluctantly. I think it is silly to have that as an extra charge, they would be smarter to just raise their rate 10 bucks, then none of us would know the difference. In summary, this is a very nice place to stay, but it is much better suited to a weekend getaway with your sweetie than for business travel.

We booked the Ultimate Harbor Experience for $210 for the entire weekend. The package included 2 nights at the Admiral Fell, 2 tickets each to the Aquarium, Science Museum and the Top of the World, 2 game cards with 40 points each to ESPN Zone and 2 water taxi tickets for free use all day. The deal was very, very good. The hotel was nice and I really liked the area-cobblestone streets, pubs, eateries, stores, etc. And the water taxi is right there, even though it was closed all weekend due to the weather. It only cost us under $7.00 for a taxi ride to the Inner Harbor. The restaurant true was very nice and breakfast was very good with a big selection. The downside: We left housekeeping $5 the first day, expecting a clean room when we got back. All she did was put the comforter back on the bed and replace the hand soaps. I could've done that for free! She didn't even vacuum (we were next door at my cousin's room and she was in there for like 10 minutes). There were also dirty glasses still in the room and the coffee pot had coffee in it from the previous guests. We were also facing the main street so you could hear everything at night-cars going by, people shouting, etc. It didn't bother me-I still fell asleep right away but I know my cousin's husband was up for hours because of the partying. The biggest advice I can give anyone on this trip that will save you from a living nightmare: DO NOT PARK IN THE PMI PARKING GARAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We arrived Friday night with plans of leaving on Sunday. We all went and ate breakfast and then my cousin and I took the luggage to checkout while our husbands went to get the car (down the street). My husband calls me on my cell phone and tells me that, in small print, on the outside of the building there are hours for Mon-Sat and then it says your car will remain in the garage until the next business day. Meaning, if you planned on leaving on Sunday forget it! The doors were locked and there were metal roll down gates and every entrance/exit so there was NO way to get your car out unless you had a monthly pass. This was not amusing and they had not posted hours anywhere inside the building. Only on the outside at the exit so that the only way you'd see them is if you turned around as you were leaving the garage. We called the number and the guy basically said oh well, we'd have to wait until 6am Monday morning. We all had work and my cousin had two small kids who were being watched by her mother, who could not call out of work the next day. We even had a police officer call and they told her the same story. We went back to the garage and found someone with a monthly pass, who was able to lift the roll down gate and let us out. We offered him money but he refused. He said every weekend he's letting people out because they do not know they are closed on Sunday. We got very lucky. My cousin has parked in that garage several times and it was always open. It's a parking garage! You don't expect that it'll be closed. Pay the $25.00/day to valet park! There was only one bellboy and people were very agitated that he was taking a long time to get their car. I told them to be thankful they were able to have their car, that mine was locked in a garage until Monday! The hotel was of no help AT ALL in getting our car. They didn't even offer to assist. They said they tell people not to park there...well no one told us! The hotel was quaint and if you like that sort of thing, stay there.

The response we received was \"well, no one else has complained.\" Will NEVER stay here again.", "Date": "February 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cSome good, some bad\u201d", "Author": "SeekingPerfection", "ReviewID": "UR5710293", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel 2 nights while visiting Johns Hopkins. Room very large and beautiful - I had 2 canopied beds. Room appeared very clean - until I stepped on glass in carpet. Found 3 different colors of shards! Very quiet. Hotel is a string of old buildings so no hallway more than 3 rooms long before hall turned or went up or down a few stairs. This dramatically cut down on hall noise. Concierge service very poor. Was told I couldn't eat in downstairs restaurant or get room service because it was \"Restaurant Week\". I asked her to help me find a place to eat dinner and she waved toward front door and told me to \"Go out there!\". Area has lots of pubs etc - not what I was looking for after a difficult day during a long trip alone. Went downstairs to restaurant anyway and they happily served me - said they always reserve tables for hotel guests. Restaurant was excellent. Morning breakfast was simply outstanding. Would stay there again but would wear slippers and not use their concierge.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Admiral Fell Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60811-d124839-Reviews-Admiral_Fell_Inn-Baltimore_Maryland.html", "Price": "$179 - $324*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">888 South Broadway</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Historic Fell's Point</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Baltimore</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21231</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "124839", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ec/df/ecdfcfe13106bce2b30d2c2551ec886e6large.jpg"}}
