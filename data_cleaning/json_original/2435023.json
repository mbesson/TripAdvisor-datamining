A very comfortable clean hotel with a good dining room and \"all you can eat\" breakfast which catered for all tastes. Plenty of food which was delicious.Our room was a double which was quite small but comfortable and had a clean modern bathroom. The pool on the rooftop was clean and cool and appreciated after a hot day. We stayed for a week and found the staff particularly helpful and friendly. We were made to feel very welcome. We would stay there again without hesitation. Transport into the city was easy - bus or cab and there are plenty of good cheap eating places close by. A couple of large modern shopping centres are within easy walking distance.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Curitiba", "Title": "\u201cNice, new, clean and modern\u201d", "Author": "Carolsaidias", "ReviewID": "UR128117606", "Content": "The hotel is very nice and clean, also new and modern.

It was very well decorated. my room was on the 3rd floor and the ceiling is i floor higher so it feels rather spacious. The rooms has tv, study table, fridge, safe, air con, bath tub, free net. The staffs are very helpful. Because I stayed for 3 nights and more, they offer free shuttle transfer us to airport. Its 5 min walk to 112 Katong and 20min walk to Parkway Parade and Marine Parade. All provides good quality local foods and everything else you might need. The slight disappointments are, there were no windows in my room, they built the bathroom there and completely blocked it. 2ndly the internet is not very fast. There were 2 nights that it has problem identifying.

The townhouses and condos gave way to the interesting colonial look of the pre-war city. There are dozens of restaurants and shops on the street level with living quarters above - all of the buildings appear in good condition. This hotel has small room but a good value. We paid 98usd in March for a small room but it had carpet, lcd tv, strong WiFi, firm beds and was very clean and fresh. The view to the North is a residential area, quite interesting. The staff was very efficient and friendly on check in. It is quiet, the door is wood and very heavy but we were on the 4th floor too, which helps I think. Point: A 9 sq m room, as posted elswhere here, is smaller than a prison cell. This hotel is Singapore fine, the rooms are about 22 sq m.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Small Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Adventuredino", "ReviewID": "UR124253486", "Content": "Excellent service. I was particularly impressed and grateful for staff's (house keeper) honesty. We left our laptop and phone charger in the rooms. staff found it and returned them to us. Front desk staff were very helpful and attentive. New, neat and clean hotel. Rooms though small are well equipped. Only thing missing is the iron and ironing board which requires a deposit of SGD10. Hotel is well located and within walking distance to eateries and cafes (same street & nearby). Hotel restaurant is currently under renovation. For families, bigger family rooms are available (these rooms are bigger than the small standard rooms but are still small). I would recommend this hotel for travellers who prefer a quiter and quaint area of Singapore and don't mind small rooms.

This hotel opened very recently and my room had numerous defects. The windows were locked shut, there was no iron or ironing board, the bedside lamp not working because it has the wrong plug for the wall socket, the bed was hard not firm and of low quality, there was no hand soap in the bathroom.
