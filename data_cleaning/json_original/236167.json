We chose to stay in one of the 3 below-ground floor rooms. We arrived at 12:30pm (an hour and a half before check-in time) expecting a wait. We were happy to discover our room was ready and were shown to it straight away. The room was huge, as was the bathroom. It was decorated nicely throughout, and in particular I loved the painted ceiling. The bed was massive and comfortable, and there was plenty of storage space. Our requests were met promptly (extra towels) and the room was made up every morning to a high degree. The staff were pleasant and accommodating. The breakfast was also nice, with an array of continental breakfast choices; pastry, bacon, eggs, cereals, breads, meats and cheese, and fruits. Cappucino was made upon request and was lovely, as was the fresh-squeezed blood orange juice. The roof terrace had a nice atmosphere and the view was nice. We also discovered (upon checking out, sadly) that the front desk sells metro tickets! The Lepanto metro station is just a stone's throw from the hotel (you can actually see it from the hotel) so it's very convenient! The location of this hotel is perfect; it's in a quiet neighborhood filled with cafes, restaurants, shops, etc. and it felt safe even at night, and was near enough to all the major attractions, certainly within walking distance.

Our room was comfortable, with the best bed of our trip; and the bathroom was large enough. The highlight of the accommodation, however, was a great little terrace that we used as much as we could as a place to relax, drink wine, plan our next day's adventures, drink wine, write postcards, drink wine... The terrace had a small table, two chairs, two basic loungers, an umbrella, and just enough greenery to create that sense of enclosure that you want. The breakfast was another highlight. This was a great breakfast spread, one of the nicest we had on the trip, with killer views of some of the domes of Rome, including St. Peter's. The location was quite good. It was only a few steps from the Lepanto Metro station, which allows for very easy access west toward St. Peter's and the Vatican Museums, or east towards Piazza del Popolo, Piazza di Spagna, etc. The Metro isn't perfect for sightseeing, as many of Rome's attractions are not really on the Metro line, but it's still handy to be close to a station. We reached the hotel by taxi from the Termini, and the cost was only 14 euros (it was a Sunday so traffic was lighter than other days). We thought this was very reasonable, given that we had to cross town and cross the Tiber. Drawbacks? A little out of the way of the major sights, perhaps, so might not be the best choice for first timers to Rome. It was perfect for us, however, since we had earlier stayed on Via Nazionale closer to the Trevi Fountain area, so this was a nice change and allowed us to explore the more 'Roman' area around Piazza del Popolo.

Our room -- number 21--was average in size for a European four star hotel and adequately appointed. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Cleaning service was prompt and effective. The bathroom was quite large and had a large sink and a modern oversized tub with shower. Very, very comfortable and soothing after a long day of touring. The A/C was silent and quite effective, well above average for vintage European hotels in our experience. We like our room very cool for sleeping and couldn't help but think the Farnese would be an excellent choice for visitors in the broiling Roman summer. Also, while our room fronted on busy Viale Giulio Cesare, the double-paned windows were quite adequate to shield us from any street noise. The breakfast buffet, which included eggs and ham, cold cuts and cheese, cereals, fresh and prepared fruits --including the best baked apples this writer has ever tasted-- a variety of breads, juices and coffees was far better than just OK, and was served in a lovely enclosed \"roof garden\" with a view of the dome of Saint Peter's Basilica. The desk staff were helpful: most of our encounters at the reception were with the thoroughly charming Louis. We arrived at the hotel in a small taxi which charged us the stipulated E45 rate from the airport. Louis arranged a limousine service to return us to the airport for E50. The comfort of a Mercedes was certainly worth the extra E5. The location of this hotel was absolutely perfect! Just two blocks from the Tiber in an attractive mixed business and residential section of Prati. The Lepanto metro stop is one short block from the hotel, providing rapid access to the Piazzas di Spagna and Barberini, the Colosseum and Forum, Testaccio and the Vatican (next stop on the A line). At the same intersection, the 30 bus gets you to the Piazza Navona in 10 minutes and the 280 gets you toTrastevere/ Isola Tiberina in 15 minutes. All this and you can stroll to fine Prati restaurants like L'Arcangelo and Da Cesare in the evening after a glass of wine in the hotel lobby or its pleasant adjoining terrace. In sum, we found the Hotel Farnese to be a very good value indeed for a Roman accommodation. Our one grievance with the hotel is that not one of the many channels available on its TV offered English language news programming. I strongly recommend that the hotel provide access to CNN and/or BBC for guests from North America, the UK, Australia and other places where English is the mother tongue.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "west orange nj", "Title": "\u201cthere are better hotels\u201d", "Author": "vivianWestOrangeNj", "ReviewID": "UR107704387", "Content": "the hotel seemed a bit pricey for what and where it is.

It was bigger than I had expected given previous Trip Advisor posts. The sleeping area consisted of a vast and comfortable double bed (with good bed linen) and a day bed for a third occupant. There is also a wall mounted flat screen TV with BBC News 24 and CNN. However, we were able to watch the football (UEFA Champions League semi) on RAI 2. If you are conscious of your looks then this is not the room for you (or perhaps it is) as there were six enormous mirrors in the rooms. Or eight, if you count the three mirrored wardrobe doors which I\u2019ve counted as one. The other mirrors are above the dressing table area (with the mini-bar fridge below to the left of where you sit), on the wall opposite the door, above the sink in the bathroom and on the back of the bathroom door. The wardrobe contains the safe and spare pillows and blankets. There are no drawers but a small amount of shelving in the wardrobe which wasn\u2019t really adequate for two so we resorted to the glass shelf above the hanging space but given my diminutive stature I would not have been able to reach (so my husband\u2019s smalls were stored there). The bathroom was large and mainly tiled with a big, corner bath with mixer shower over. There was a bidet, toilet and a very large sink. There was also a small stool and wheeled shelving unit for your toiletries. The complimentary tray was basic: soap, shower gel, shower caps, tissues and two sachets of \u2018personal hygiene\u2019 liquid. There were nice big towels which were stored on a heated towel rail and which were changed daily. (I don\u2019t like this practice as I think that it\u2019s environmentally unfriendly but others may have a different view.) The plumbing was idiosyncratic as sometimes the hot supply spluttered as a result of air in the system; so beware when you turn it on as it may suddenly come out in an enormous splash. The tiled floor had a couple of cracks, there was what looked like a small cigarette burn on the side of the bath and the plug operating system didn\u2019t work (the plastic cover came off when you turned it) so you had to prise the plug out to let the water run away. On our first evening we went out for a meal and on our return found that not only had the maid turned down the bed but had tastefully laid out our pyjamas (and I\u2019d brought a functional pair, not a slinky number) so we hid our nightclothes on subsequent days. When we went to bed we tried to sleep with the window open but as this room is side onto the busy (and very noisy) Viale Giulio Cesare we discovered that the window system is extremely efficient. The outer layer is a traditional slatted shutter. The next layer is a triple glazed window and the third layer is an internal shutter. When all three are used they cut out most of the noise and all of the light so you may need an alarm clock to wake you as you will be unaware of the morning unfolding and you won\u2019t want to miss breakfast. This for me was the best bit of the hotel; the rooftop breakfast room. At the time we stayed (late April) it was largely covered but I believe that it is opened in the summer. However you still get great views across the Roman rooftops of the beautiful dome of San Gioacchino (well worth a visit if you like Pre-Raphaelite decoration) and St Peter\u2019s. The buffet style breakfast is very varied and good quality so I won\u2019t list all the items (but who eats chocolate torte for breakfast?). The helpful, friendly waitress\u2019 willingness to make fresh cappuccino and espresso has already been documented but I liked being able to squeeze our own oranges for really fresh juice. The rest of the staff were friendly and helpful (although we weren\u2019t overly enthralled by the desk clerk\u2019s recommendations for dinner \u2013 avoid the Porto di Ripetta in the Via di Ripetta unless you have deep pockets and can stand the obsequious owner but the Perilli in Prati in Via Otranto was probably the best of the bunch).

I LOVE Italy and have made it my adopted \"home,\" so I am hard pressed to say ANYTHING negative about the nation! When in Rome in '05, my husband and I had stayed at the Capo D'Africa, which is hard to beat. But the Farnese was great, too! This hotel is conveniently located on Via Alessandro Farnese, a main thoroughfare that runs near the edge of the old city of Rome. Only 3-4 blocks from a main subway line, getting around Rome from the Farnese is a snap! What's very cool about this hotel is that it sits right near the Tiber River, so it is VERY near Vatican City, St. Peter's Basilica and the Castle Saint Angelo but also near many historic Roman city sites, which are accesible by subway, taxi, bus or foot! One thing to remember, this hotel is on the complete opposite side from the Coloseum, the Imperial and Roman Forums, the Campidoglio, etc...so, if you want to stay near the ancient ruins and such, just realize that this hotel is on the complete other end of the city...but you can get to those sites easily from the Farnese. Our room at the Farnese was great. While a bit small (typical for rooms in Italy, esp Rome), the room was beautifully furnished, cozy and very clean. The shower and bathroom were great and spotless. The shower (by Italian standards) was big and the room's queen sized bed was VERY comfortable. We even had a little patio with 2 chairs and a table overlooking the street behind the Hotel Farnese. The hotel, which was once a private residence for Italian aristocrats, is beautifully decorated and dates back to 1906. Breakfasts were great and typical for Rome (boiled eggs, meats, cheeses, juices, cappuccino, pastries, croissants, breads, etc) but very fresh and tasty. I could eat b'fast like this EVERYDAY, 'cause I'm not a hot breakfast freak (sausage, meat, potatoes, hot eggs, pancakes), etc. I LOVE the Italians in Italy and the personnel at the Farnese were no exception. While not overly fuzzy and effusive, the front desk folks were efficient, polite and very helpful. The concierge arranged transportation for us on several occasions. If you do not speak Italian, everyone at the hotel speaks some English (minus our wonderful housekeeper, with whom I communicated with in Italian...my very poor Italian)! Here's the best...in our haste to make it to our airport on our last morning, my husband left several $100's worth of majolica behind, in our room's closet. This recollection came to us while we were on Alitalia, somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean! Of course, being Americans from New York City, we were certain that the majolica would be lifted or stolen. Well, after one call to the Farnese, the manager located and secured the items (which had been turned in by housekeeping)and they reassured me that they would safely ship the pieces out to the USA. We worked out a payment option and despite a cost of over $140 US dollars (yep, I know), the majolica arrived. Now, it was NOT the Farnese's fault...one VERY fragile piece was broken, (which I think my husband had accidentally broken in transit). But the other, less fragile pieces, arrived in perfect shape. Nonetheless, I could tell that the Farnese staff went through extra effort to safely package and ship the majolica. I couldn't imagine another hotel (except those in Italy-smile) going through all the trouble to secure, safely pack, post and mail several pieces of sizeable majolica! THANK YOU HOTEL FARNESE! What else can I say? I love Italy, I love Rome and the Farnese is a great place.

The hotel includes a small bar, internet access via wireless and a computer for use at a nominal price. The sevice from the entire staff was excellent. Whether you need directions, airport transfers or reservations we always received excellent service. The hotel is located in an upscale neighborhood, a few blocks off a main street. The Lepanto metro station is just a few steps away but frankly we walked everywhere. The Vatcan Museum is 15 minutes, Piazza de Puoplolo is only 10, The Coloseum took about 30 minutes but was very pleasant as we took the Via de Corso route and stopped for Sunday Mass along the way. Navonna is about 15 minutes walk at most. We ate all around town but did have great pizza about 5 blocks from the hotel at San Marco Pizza.

I did have noise through my open window facing the main street, however when closed it was not an issue and there was no need for that window to be open anyway since the air conditioner worked great. I didn't notice much noise from my window facing the side street. The shower did have a tendency to put a lot of water on the floor, but I determined it was the side vent showerheads causing this. When we used just the overhead showerhead, it was just fine. Being right next to Lepanto Metro station made it easy to get around. Food great, service great, beautiful hotel.

Just try getting that kind of service any where else. As if the service alone wasn't a good enough reason to stay at the Hotel Farnese, the location was fantastic. Convenient to all of the sites of Rome and yet you'll feel like you are living in a secluded Roman neighborhood, albeit an upscale one. The room was beautiful, immaculate, spacious, richly decorated and authentically furnished. The bathroom was large and perfectly appointed. Everything about the Hotel Farnese exudes class, charm, warmth, romance, and a truely gracious Roman experience. I could go on and on about it but go and see for yourself. I followed the advice of past guests and boy am I glad I did!!..If I am ever lucky enough to go back to Rome, I would not consider staying anywhere else.

The trip was a belated 70th birthday present for my mother and a treat for my two sisters. In total, there were 4 in our party. Like all reviewers I had researched various hotels on tripadvisor and this being my second visit to the eternal city I knew what type of accommodation I wanted. First, I booked directly with the hotel and got a terrific rate for one triple room and one double room, far less than what was on offer on the internet. Second, good and kind attentive service was important to me in selecting a hotel on this trip. The staff and service provided at the hotel were excellent. The hotel although old and not equipped with room safes, is extremely well maintained, very clean and full of character. It is a small and personable hotel. If you are looking for a new boutique hotel with all \"mods\" and \"cons\" but which can be cold and unwelcoming, then look elsewhere. A previous critic mentioned the hard beds! Yes they are firm but that's entirely subjective! I personally like a soft bed but then again my mother and sisters found their beds just perfect. And, the bed sheets were crisp linen sheets! There was ample choice for breakfast(buffet style with fruit, cold meats, cheese, hot croissants, cakes, toast, scrambled egg and bacon etc) and the cappucinos were excellent. I believe the hotel has plans to move the breakfast room located in a basement room up to the rooftop in the near future. There you can see the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. Although the hotel is located right next to the metro stop we walked to the Vatican and mostly got taxis which were quite reasonable for a group of 4. The neighbourhood felt safe at night unlike the Termini area at night where I stayed three years ago which can feel a little bit seedy. The restaurants recommended by the hotel were excellent. I wish we only had more time and yes we would return to the Hotel Farnese again.", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cQuiet base for the Eternal City\u201d", "Author": "robbogee", "ReviewID": "UR5817459", "Content": "Some other reviewers have not been happy with this hotel, but we have just returned from a 5-night stay and found it to be an ideal quiet base away from the hubbub from which to explore the city. The metro station is a two minute walk away and a 1Euro ticket will take you into the heart of the city if you can't manage the 10/15 minute walk along safe leafy streets. OK, the rooms are not palatial, but they are very clean, with traditional furniture, and the bed linen is changed every other day. The sheets are linen, which is stiffer than cotton and may be why a previous reviewer found them \"itchy\". There is a small terrace on the ground floor where you can have a drink from the small bar, but don't expect too much from the roof terrace which is tiny. The staff were extremely efficient and very friendly and helpful, and gave us suggestions for restaurants, which we enjoyed. The best was the trattoria Ragno D'Oro (Golden Spider) just a ten minute walk away, run by Marco and his sons. Everything revolves around son Fabio who will suggest his recommendations from the kitchen's output that night, although there is also a menu if you insist. Nothing was too much trouble, and if there was a delay in a course appearing he would slip a small plate of pasta onto the table to keep us going. The antics of the staff are sheer restaurant theatre and you will need to book to be certain of a table, such is its popularity with local people. We ate there 3 nights out of our 5 in Rome. We are not easily pleased, but we can certainly recommend Hotel Farnese as a quiet base.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limerick, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "Eldarro", "ReviewID": "UR5812581", "Content": "I booked this hotel after reading rave reviews on this site, and because it was ranked the #4 hotel in Rome on TripAdvisor at the time. I was going to be in Italy with my girlfriend for 10 days, and wanted to spend the last night somewhere special, and this looked like it fit the bill perfectly. It doesn't. This is a clean, nice hotel, with good staff, but the room we stayed in was very small and dark -- a gloomy room that makes you think of rainy Sundays!!! The bathroom was spacious and modern, which was a bonus -- from the look of the floor layout on the fire escape plans, some of the other rooms are larger but have smaller bathrooms (with only showers). The TV was a portable, without any movies or other features, and the communal room on the ground floor was quite small. It's listed as a 4 star hotel, but I think it's no more than an average 3 star. I'd have given the hotel a 3 star review, normally, since, as I said, it's not a BAD hotel, just nothing special. But given some of the other glowing reviews on this site (posted by friends of the owners, mayhaps????), I think it's necessary to balance the scales a bit -- hence the 3 star rating. If you get a good rate, and don't mind being a small room, then it's not a bad hotel and isn't TOO far from the centre. But it's certainly nothing special, and came as quite a letdown for us in the end, based on its high standing on TripAdvisor.

I specfically asked him if it was affordable and he said, \"Oh yes very affordable.\" It's one of those restaurants without a menu - and since we had a great experience with one of these in Rome just a few days earlier - we didnt hesitate. Once we got there, my \"scam\" alert should've went off when we were the only ones in the restaurant. The food was plentiful - but not that great. However, the disappointment didn't settle in until I got the bill for 90 euros and a waiter saying \"this doesn't include service.\"--very classy.
