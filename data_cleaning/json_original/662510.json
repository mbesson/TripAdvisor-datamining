My sister-in-law and I decided to take the kids to Branson for a quick, inexpensive overnight visit, so I thought we'd give SO a try again. The clerk was very friendly and the lobby had recently been remodeled, compliments of the Travel Channel's Hotel Impossible. We stayed in a 3-queen room, since there were 5 of us. The common hallways are hot. Keys are still in use, instead of key cards, so we could only get 2 keys (we needed 3). As always, the room was large and clean. The sheets, however, must have been the same ones from years ago, as were the towels. They were thin and scratchy. New sheets are needed! Same for the towels. A coffee maker is provided, as was a mini frig (in the 3-Q room, but not double rooms). Our AC worked well, and the room cooled off. The television was very small, and old style. In such a large room, a larger (32\"?) flat screen would have been wonderful. We went down for the free continental breakfast at 9:05 (it was open until 9:30 am). They were out of donuts, cinnamon rolls, and hot biscuits, although the attendant did offer to make us biscuits. The regular coffee was also empty, and she did make us fresh. Still available was bread to toast (no bagels), cereal, and a bowl of not-too-great-looking canned fruit. We were disappointed. We had 3 kids with us, and all wanted donuts. The clerk also vacuumed while we were eating, including under our feet, which was somewhat annoying. We were the only people eating the entire time, so this could have waited. Overall, if you want a clean, relatively inexpensive (our room was $80) hotel room, and don't mind old amenities, then SO fits the bill. I hope the hotel owners will put some much needed TLC into this property and update the rooms. Hotel Impossible did a prototype guest room for them, and hopefully, they will remodel every room to match. The breakfast needs a little work. The swimming pools are great, although the indoor pool area was extremely hot and it felt like the heater was on. The location is great, and staff was very helpful and friendly. We will wait until a bit of remodeling is done before we return, but it IS clean!!", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is wonderful, beautiful and maintains great customer service.\u201d", "Author": "mrskirk", "ReviewID": "UR131357587", "Content": "I love this hotel.

As another person mentioned, the odd thing was that they didn't allow irons in the room, but we were close to the laundy room/ironing station so that didn't cause a problem. We didn't try the inside pool, but the outdoor pool was clean. One reviewer said the shower head was short and they were right on target, but on the flip side, we had plenty of hot water and the water pressure was excellent. Would I stay again --sure! Folks need to keep in mind if they want a trendy, new hotel they need to pay more than the $60 that this hotel charged. For the money, it was an okay place to stay. Plus, we loved the location. Off Highway 76 so we could use the alternative routes and didn't have to fight traffic to get to our hotel. We didn't try the breakfast bar so can't rate that..

We did not get it! In Branson you can find alot of \"mom & pop\" type of hotels for $29-$39 a night, so for $70. a night I was expecting something better. The room appeared large but dated. Seriously, there was room for a couch and a kitchenette - so it looked sparse with only 2 beds, a dresser and a table and chairs. The tub looked very old - the worst part was that it had long black hair smeared all over the side of the wall - gross! We didn't discover that until we were showering the next morning, or we would've checked out immediately. The shower head is about chest high, approx 4 feet from the bottom of the bathtub - so it's great for kids or really short people. The floor didn't appear to have been vacuumed b/c there were plastic remnants of price tags that hadn't been vacuumed up. The sheets were cheap and thin, and there were no blankets on the bed so for warmth you have to use the disgusting old bedspread that does NOT get washed between guests. The breakfast was mediocre. They offered cream gravy and biscuits and what they described as really good cinnamon rolls (which they weren't), they had cold cereal and instant oatmeal. The 2 elderly ladies that kept up with breakfast seemed nice but they couldn't keep up with the supply of food needed and the line was out the door of the \"Garden Room\" (code for basement) which was a hike to find. There were even signs reading \"Almost There!\" b/c it was so inconvenient. I do not recommend staying on the bottom (1st) floor b/c they apparently decided to save money by placing no insulation between the floors - we were awoken early to the sound of children jumping/running/hopping/skipping- basically coming through the ceiling. We called the front desk but they acted like it was a hassle to contact the guests. I knew we were getting a bare-bones hotel, but this was BAD. I expect a clean room, decent bedding, and that's about it. This was Disgusting- with a capital D!

I phoned the hotel and inquired about rates and reservations. I asked the age of the hotel and they said the building itself was about 20 years old but that all of the rooms had been updated.

The rooms may have been updated at one point but I don't believe the rooms we stayed in have been updated in the past 10-15 years. Also, the outside pool was NOT heated so after jumping into a cool pool the first night our kids were not interested in swimming any other time we were there.

We were in the last building by the indoor pool. The rooms are well used, can use some remodeling but overall were very clean. We put our maid sign out everyday and our rooms were cleaned everytime. We enjoyed the indoor pool and hot tub. On the weekend it was always full, but during the week it wasnt crowded at all, and there was always plenty of towels. We ate breakfast there every morning, donuts, biscuits and gravy. We had refrigerators in our rooms for an extra charge, but worth it. The hotel staff was always friendly. We were in the interior corridors. I took full advantage of their guest laundry. It was always quiet and we did not hear any of our neighbors. We will be staying here again for Thanksgiving. Location is great and easy to get in and out of.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNever again!\u201d", "Author": "DKforTravel", "ReviewID": "UR8084346", "Content": "The Southern Oaks used to be a decent place to stay. Not anymore! Rooms are in terrible need of a refurb. Our room had a smell to it upon entering. We were completely missed by housekeeping on a Saturday. I called to the desk at 1:30 pm, and I was assured I would get service, they were just running behind. We returned to our room at 10:30pm that night, still untouched by housekeeping. I called the front desk and the worker said she was alone and I would have to bring my dirty towels up to her and she would give me fresh ones. The pool never had towels availabe in the tub designated \"pool towels\", by the way. Upon check out, I spoke to a manager and she really didn't care to seem to make things better. There are plenty of other place to stay in Branson, and I will never stay at this place again.
