THE GOOD: The room was incredibly clean, so housekeeping was great.. The hotel was nice. We had coffee in the armoire, although neither of us took advantage of this. We loved the Whole Foods that was adjacent. Everything was a convenient walk away, about 15 minutes. The hotel is very quiet, we were on level 7 in room 706. Although, occasionally you will hear doors slam (every night it seemed, but only because the doors are HEAVY). Our room was a premiere king. The bed was incredibly comfortable, the shower was big and spacious. The bathtub was deep and you could watch tv through the sliding panels. Big windows. It was very relaxing and I LOVED returning to our room every night. THE BAD: Housekeeping accidentally (?) threw away an article of clothing we had just purchased as a souvenir, which irked me but I let it go. Front desk staff wasn't very warm and friendly.. In fact, they were a little snooty. THE UGLY: The doormen are nice, always courteous and one offered to give us directions. But one night we came back and there weren't any around, but whatever.. I can open my own door, no big deal, right? Until my boyfriend opens the door for me and here comes the doorman who decides to post right in the open door and hugs a woman and they chat, all while my boyfriend is sitting there holding the door open there for them. SERIOUSLY? I don't really blame this on the hotel, but even if you were not employed by the hotel, grab the door and hold it open for yourself and your lady friend. Don't just sit there and have a conversation and hug while leaving my awkward boyfriend who is too sweet to shut the door on these two.. It was just rude, not even a thank you. Even we thank the doormen and they're getting paid for their job. My boyfriend loved this hotel, he said it was his favorite hotel room. It still hasn't completely convinced me, though.. The rooms are nice, but customer service is lacking in this establishment. It was not near what I was expecting and definitely needs to be improved. I may or may not stay here again on our next visit.

We were warmly welcomed at the front desk and made to feel right at home. (All of the staff was pleasant and very accommodating throughout our stay.) The lobby is very pretty and full of light...even in Seattle. Our room had a fabulous view of the Space Needle....so cool! The room was clean, modern and comfortable. The bathroom has a BIG soaking tub with sliding doors opening to the room, so after a long day of walking around Seattle, you can enjoy a bath and a glass of wine while gazing out of the Space Needle. The breakfast in the Lobby Bar was very good...as was room service...and the Whole Foods is just downstairs to pick up a quick bite or snacks for the room. The hotel is a short walk from the Space Needle and monorail. A streetcar stops right in front of the hotel and goes to the Pike Place Market area. There is a hotel courtesy car that runs for free within a 2-mile radius during the week. Cabs are also easily available and fairly inexpensive to get a ride in when it's raining.

Read lots of reviews and decided that the Pan Pacific was on our shortlist of 3. I rang to see if we could get a deal and Kayla answered the phone to me and was so helpful, friendly and informative that our decision was made and we booked the Pan Pacific without checking any other rates at any other hotel. The deal we got included Valet Parking which was invaluable as parking at the hotel is $39 a night ( in and out allowed) The valet team were fab, and when they saw us coming would run and get the car and put the heated seats on for us so we were nice and toasty! All of the staff are so warm and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble, they are very interactive and will help you with local places to eat, visit etc. The rooms are lovely, found the shutters from the bathroom to the bedroom a little unconventional but they are easily shut so no drama. We had a room overlooking the back, but some rooms overlook the space needle. The rooms are spacious and the beds comfy. The bath towels were a tad on the small side, I like big towels wrapped round me and these were a lttle small but this is such a minor thing. The addition of Whole foods was invaluable, after a long flight from the UK, we popped down there to eat ( once we worked out what to do with the boxes etc) so all was good there and was handy to get water and snacks for breakfast. The location of this hotel is perfect right by the I-5 and close to town, as the weather was so poor we used the car a lot ( paid the parking charges ouch) and took advantage of the palces that we could get too. We also went to Vancouver for the day which was fun, the border control officers thought we were lost both ways which was amusing. Take a trip to the following places Pike Market (breakfast in Lowells was lovely we went twice), Kerry Park for the views, the Seattle outlet mall, Boeing factory the list goes on but all easily reached from the hotel.

The hotel is located in a busy shopping center that contains a Whole Foods and several other smaller shops. The hotel offers valet parking for a (pricey) fee, and the onsite parking garage isn't much better. We parked on the street without any difficulty, payed the meter and saved a significant amount of money. Check in was easy, we arrived early and our room was not ready. We were offered a similar, handicapped room which we declined after viewing. We were then offered an upgrade to a space needle view for a discounted price. The front desk employee worked with us to satisy. The room was a corner room, large, with floor to ceiling windows. Bath room has a seperate tube and shower, the tub has a screen that opens and allows one to view the room. Overall spacious and well appointed. Bed was large and comfortable. Corner desk was present with a very comfortable chair. The room included a fridge and a flat screen tv as well. Hotel loby is clean, warm, and inviting (fireplace off to the side). Be aware that the building is shared with tenants that own the upper floors, so they occasionally come through the hotel. They do have a seperate entrance and elevator bank. We had a cocktail at the hotel bar after arriving, the bartender was friendly and quick. The only mis-step of the stay occurred when we were enjoying our free \"Pan Pacific\" breakfast the next morning. We asked the breakfast server how we redeemed out breakfast and how much we could spend. He had no idea. We ordered a meal that was approximately 20 dollars total. AFTER the server brought our food, he informed us that we could only order one specific type of food with that deal. We were unsure of why he didn't inform us of this when we asked BEFORE ordering our food. My significant other questioned this at the front desk, and our entire breakfast was comped.

I think that it's rated four stars, but there were so many things about it that felt much more like a 5 star hotel. First of all, the rooms are really tastefully decorated. I read some reviews that said the rooms were too basic, but I disagree - the style is zen modern, and the decor made me feel instantly relaxed and calm. The bathroom was especially nice - it had a large, separate soaking tub and a glass enclosed shower. Note that I had the most basic room type. Linens and toiletries were also all top-notch. And having that Whole Foods on the ground floor could not have been more convenient. FYI: it's one of the nicest Whole Foods I've ever been to in my life, at least in terms of the prepared foods section. There are a bunch of other amenities nearby but I think that in general, the hotel is a little bit out of the main tourist area, for better or worse. You could probably walk to some of the main attractions, but it would be a long walk, recommended only for nice weather days. One small negative point (not enough to knock off a star): valet parking only (no self-park) and it's expensive! $39(?) for 24 hours in/out privileges. I think it's around the price of other hotels, but since this hotel is slightly outside the main tourist area, I still think it's a bit high.

To come stay in Seattle, I would stay in downtown. Clearly this place will be serving Amazon business, and other Paul Allen adventures in the redevelopment of South Lake Union. My comments below may help you understand why. Narrative of our stay. The valet people were expedient, nice, and competent. Check-in was quick an easy, after which we found out the hotel was at 100% capacity for the evening. Not a surprise, since we were staying there for New Years Eve. Even though they were at 100 % capacity, it did not feel like it at all except for a one of failure on their part. We opted in to buy the welcome champagne bottle in the room gift. It was suppose to arrive to our room shortly after our arrival. We waited 30 minutes. Nothing, called down to Service One (their name for customer service) and they would check on it. 30 minutes later it arrived. It arrived one minute before we were going to cancel it and start our evening elsewhere. Room The room (Premium King City View) was adequate. I'd say these rooms are more geared for the business traveler but not uncomfortable for the couple either. A single office chair and desk, and a day bed'ish lounger are there besides the bed. A 32-inch LCD sits on top of a short wide dresser (half is taken up with the mini-bar). Local TV channels are all non-HD, so not a big deal, but another nicety not there. Armoire plenty big, and more than enough hangers (nice wood with spring clips). Ironing board, and iron also stored in there. The windows are 3/4 full length and the whole width of the room. There are condominium buildings near by so privacy with the curtains open is minimal (feel sorry for the condo owners, although they must get good entertainment at times). A small 12-inch window can be opened! That is a nice feature to get fresh air. On that note, the climate control in the room is very efficient and fast. The room temperature was easily and quickly controlled. A small electronic safe is in the room. Might be able to fit a small laptop...maybe (I forgot to check the depth of it). Mini bar It's one of those magnetic ones that automatically bill you as soon as a bottle is used or MOVED. I opened the fridge door, didn't touch a thing, but at check out it said we consumed 3 mini-bar items ($7.95 an item). Clearly this happens frequently, they didn't bat an eye when we said we didn't take anything from the mini-bar. So check your bill upon checking out! Bathroom Nice decor with granite and tile, large soaking tub with the wall that can open up into the bedroom and still have a view to the city. All the amenities for soaps, shampoo's, conditioner, etc. Nice spa quality! Only critique is the water pressure for the sink is way too much, and not enough in the shower. The sink can spray out from the basin, so be careful if dressed up already. While the shower pressure is adequate it's not great, but that might be a personal preference. Again, the bathroom is more a 1 person bathroom in size, but not uncomfortable for 2 that are intimate with each other. The hair dryer is a REAL hair dryer so no need to bring one. The toilet is a eco friendly, with half flush and full flush option. The only thing missing (in my opinion) are Q-tips. Why hotels don't include them continually amazes me. The cost is nearly zero to provide a few per night. Also, for the air traveler, there is no toothpaste or mouthwash either. Again, in these days of 1-qt bags of liquids, I would like to see hotels start providing that as well as the shampoo. Complimentary coffee in the room is a good quality local brand. But if you opt for your own, the maker is the type (4-cup) that you could buy your own and filters and brew a pot. It's not the single serving type. I prefer the 4-cup type because you can bring your own grind as an option. Tea: NOT provided by default. You need to request it from customer service. So if you're a tea drinker, as for some tea when you check in. The alarm clock is iphone/ipod docking station kind. BUT, if you have the \"Bumper\" for your iphone, it will not connect properly. You need to take it off for it to connect. The bed, while the beds are commissioned by the Queen of England, they are an average comfort bed, not phenomenal. The linen on the other hand is AWESOME! Pillows are fluffy down. One drawback, if you want to prop up in bed to watch some late night or morning news, the pillows are far too soft to prop up. You need to abscond some cushions from the lounge chair, which really doesn't work well. There are no extra pillows in the armoire augment. So...not comfortable to watch TV in bed. The view There are a couple of rooms per floor that have a fantastic view of the Space Needle. But only a couple! The otherwise the city views are kind of typical for a Seattle hotel, except no water views at all. Conveniences The hotel also provides access to a gym which is a spa/gym, and the equipment quality is fantastic along with the size. I've experienced maybe one other hotel with an equivalent. So if your a gym person, you're styling! Only critique is it's a short walk across a courtyard outside. There is a gourmet grocery (Whole Foods) store within the same structure, so anything you may want can be bought there. A Starbucks is also in the same structure. I'm not really familiar with West Elm, but my girlfriend loves west elm. There is one across the street. The lobby of the hotel has a gas fireplace with a nice setup of couches. The love seat couches are next to the fireplace are surprisingly UNcomfortable. But, the hotel bar named The Bar will serve drinks to you out there. NICE!! I have to comment on the name THE BAR. That is such an Abbot and Costello name....let's meet in the bar. Which bar? The bar. Okay, which bar? THE BAR!! It works because there are 2 bars in the place, The Bar and the Seastar bar. I digress. There is a light rail transit just outside, the South Lake Union Transit...yes the nick name is S.L.U.T. Compliments of Paul Allen. You can even find t-shirts with such, e.g. I rode the... You do have to pay, not sure of the cost but probably a couple of bucks. THE BAR Caution- cell service is No Service!! At least for ATT customers. So don't be waiting in the bar (The Bar) for someone expecting a call! You have to be almost back in the lobby/fireplace to get a signal. Otherwise, the bartenders were great, pleasant, helpful! Their choice of ambient music (unofficial music) is fantastic too. Not the elevator music one may expect. Seastar restaurant is on premises. A great restaurant. See my separate review for that, with a couple of recommendations on menu items. Cons You are not conveniently located downtown. Everything starts a few blocks away and further. So if inclement weather occurs, you'll need to taxi around. If you want to stay there and walk around the town, I'd say this is not the best location. You really do feel kind of isolated from downtown. There is the light rail (mentioned above) that can take you either to Lake Union where more restaurants are located or to Westlake center the beginning of downtown city life (but Westlake Center itself is kind of marginal in my opinion). BTW, if you by a s.l.u.t. ticket, that does not work for the METRO transit, although metro transit is free downtown.

Nice robs, towels and toiletries are also a nice touch. As is the free in-room wi-fi. My only caveat about the hotel, is that it is bland. All the tones in the public spaces and in the room ran from light brown to dark brown. This may be a small deal to many guests, especially since in all other respects the hotel presents so well.

Hotel didn't have a vaporizer/humidifier for use which is not surprising. They did offer an air purifier, which is useless, and did not offer anything that would help or change of room. Other things that should have been there, especially for this caliber hotel and price range: make up/shaving mirror, jets in tub, scale, better toiletries/amenities in bathroom (they could learn a lot from other hotels like fairmonts around the States or especially the Langham hotels around the world). Probably will not stay here again unless major upscaling is done. But they did have a beautifully decorated lobby and friendly staff.

This was our final stop on a long road trip from SFO to SEA. We had stayed here 2 years ago and found our second visit as enjoyable as the first. In fact, the neighborhood has evolved a bit only improving the experience. The property has a luxurious feel bordering on stuffy. I think the stuffiness comes from serving more business travelers vs. pleasure travelers. Not a criticism, just an observation as everyone is very proper, professional and somewhat robotic... not a bad thing - efficiency is good. The rooms are standard size. I booked a premium king and the room size is adequate. Honestly, I like their rooms because of the bathroom. The soaking tub is divine. Nice size shower. A proper hair dryer rather than a tiny thing attached to a wall. Comfy robes. Obviously, I like a nice bathroom and put emphasis on this part of the room. The one drawback is the sliding screen that opens the tub/bathroom to the bedroom area. Now, this is no big deal for me and my husband but if I was a traveling with someone and wanted privacy, well, you hear everything in the bathroom because of these screens. Again, no biggie for most but if you are a new couple and still not completely comfortable with each other, there isn't much privacy/sound proofing with those screens. The location of the hotel is what I would call city fringe - not the CBD but certainly close enough. You can easily walk to Pike Place Market and to other city spots. I believe the neighborhood is South Lake Union and it does not offer much in terms of restaurants and shopping but you can access other areas from the Pan Pacific + they have a complimentary car service at certain times of day to get you were you need to go. There is a Whole Foods Market and a Starbucks on the property so that helps with a quick coffee, breakfast, snacks etc as the hotel does not have coffee service in the morning (I refuse to use those in-room coffee makers). And, the Whole Foods has a grill that will cook any fish or meat for you + they offer great sides. It's an affordable way to grab a seafood dinner on the cheap but still have high quality. The gym is nice. All updated equipment and plenty of space. I used the gym twice during the stay and it was never crowded and was very clean. I love this hotel. It is comfortable, great location, pleasant staff, great amenities and I will stay here again if I travel to Seattle.

South Lake Union (SLU) is a great new (redeveloped) area between downtown and Lake Union. Lots of good restaurants around the corner. With a family, the Whole Foods, Starbucks, and Pizza Restaurant right below the hotel were very handy.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfect girl's weekend with a view\u201d", "Author": "kiwishell1970", "ReviewID": "UR116322991", "Content": "Great location, beautiful view of the space needle from our window and the staff couldn't have been nicer.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calabasas, California", "Title": "\u201cDecent value - accommodating staff\u201d", "Author": "MG21800", "ReviewID": "UR116303333", "Content": "Stayed for 2 nights with my wife and son.

The Pan Pacific met our needs quite well, though we encountered a few snags in terms of our room. We booked a lake view queen room, which ended up being a construction-site-with-the-lake-in-the-far-background-view room, but the room itself was very nice -- except for said snags. Herewith, I will attempt to describe for you the pluses and minuses of our stay this weekend. The cons: (1) One of the light sockets was not working, which posed a problem for me because I travel with a CPap machine and I needed an outlet near the bed. The front desk promised to send someone up to look at the problem and offered an extension cord in the meantime. I don't know if they ever sent someone up to look at the socket but the socket remained \"dead\" our entire stay, so while this particular snag was not a biggie, it was not fixed either. (2) The cordless phone next to the bed was virtually impossible to use. (3) Some of the promised little extras, such as a corkscrew, and a cubby in the mini fridge for storing food or drink items we purchased were missing from the room. (4) We requested a wakeup call the day of our departure, but did not receive one. The pros: (1) The hotel is in a great location, close to a trolley stop, good restaurants, and above a Whole Foods. (2) Our room was very clean and smelled fresh. (3) Our bathroom was large and spa-like, with a wonderful soaking tub. (4) The bed and the rollaway cot were both very comfortable. (5) We got a pretty decent rate for our stay. All in all and taking all of the above into consideration, while our stay at the Pan Pacific was not perfect, it came pretty close, and I feel good about recommending this hotel to others.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cA Great Choice\u201d", "Author": "ValuingTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR116023035", "Content": "This is a wonderful hotel. Relatively new, in an area that is seeing considerable redevelopment off the main drag of downtown Seattle. The hotel itself is an oasis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the architectural and styling lines ooze creature comfort. Check in is flawless, with no limit on the amount of information conveyed in a helpful, welcoming way. Even booking through Expedia, at a reduced advance rate, we were given a 10th floor Lake view room. The room boasts almost floor to ceiling windows from post to post. The amount of natural light is stunning, even on two gloomy days in Seattle. The bathroom is set off by sliding doors, which when opened convey and reinforce a sense of roominess. The natural wood and compatible fixtures are handsomely elegant, again, just right for the space. The bed and working areas are top notch. As others have noted, the only glitch in the offering, if you have to fall for it, is the parking rate, now up to $39/day. There are many other self-parking options in the neighborhood, all apparently safe. I managed to leave our rental car on the street each night for a grand total of $0.

We found it to be a clean and friendly hotel with wide, quiet halls and an iconic view through tall windows. Location The hotel is located in an interesting complex with a Starbuck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, cards/gifts shop, and a pet store. There's a nice public park, Denny Park, kitty-corner, that is great for walking, and it ensures that no buildings will block the view of the Space Needle. Best of all, downstairs (accessible by lift and escalator) is a giant Whole Foods Market. The Whole Foods Market provides all kinds of breakfast lunch and dinner foods and tables. If you select a steak, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll cook it for you, and you can sit down and eat it. The most interesting shops would be along Westlake Street. We walked to Pike's Place, stopping at Serious Pie on Virginia Street near 4th Avenue for a Yukon potato pizza. We had taken the Gourmet Seattle tour, and we were not impressed with any of the \"gourmet\" dishes except the potato pizza. Restaurant We were happy to find that Seastar restaurant is accessible through the hotel. It has excellent food. The hotel provides a coupon for a free soup or salad. We especially enjoyed the crab and corn bisque and halibut with artichokes and mushrooms. There is also a pizza restaurant, Tutta Bella, next to the Seastar. Room Or room was quite large with a view of the Space Needle from the desk, the bed, and the bathroom sink. A coffee maker and a hair dryer are in the closet, but in order to be used, they have to be moved to a location where there is an electric plug. The refrigerator was cold but there was no freezer. There are both a phone and a temperature control in the bathroom. We received a free newspaper every day. Quiet enjoyment The fourth floor may be a bit low for light sleepers because trucks go up a grade on the Denny Way side of the room. The windows are double windows and we had no problem with the traffic noise. No neighbor noise, not even footsteps overhead. Internet Everyone gets free Internet. A huge plus. We used only wireless because the signal was good and strong and we couldn't find a LAN cable in the desk. Concierge The doormen are special here. The concierge personnel open the door and engage guests in conversation which makes them seem especially friendly and helpful. The concierge, I think it was Mike, gave us a lift in the hotel car to the Space Needle (uphill) and we walked back to the hotel (downhill). We ate lunch at SkyCity and found the food and service to be a good value and not overpriced. We were enchanted with our stay at the Pan Pacific Seattle, not only for the attentiveness of the staff and a great view, but also for the proximity to downtown and (most of all) the Whole Foods Market.

The location is a bit unusual, sandwiched between downtown and Seattle Center, but not really close to either. On a nice day, it's a short enough walk to these attractions even with a four year-old, but by the end of the day, we were tired enough to have to take a cab back to the hotel (about 8-10 bucks depending on traffic). On the plus side, there's a really nice Whole Foods downstairs which means endless drinks and snacks for a reasonable price. For a 4 1/2 star hotel, the service was a little disappointing. While the front desk was pleasant, the general responsiveness of the staff was not up to the standards I normally expect in this price range. On arrival, we were pretty much ignored by the valet for ten minutes as he took a call at his kiosk. Getting some extra bedding took two calls to housekeeping, and although we called down fifteen minutes in advance to retrieve our car, they didn't bother, and we had to wait around for them to get it only after we had checked out.

Many times the curbside attendants put us in an unmarked towncar where there was a flat price for where we wanted to go. And the drivers never had change on them, so for a 10$ ride you would be force to tip 10$ if all you had on you was 20s like we did.

While the room wasn't huge, every facet of the room was clearly designed to enhance a sense of comfort -- both physical comfort and comfort with one's surroundings. I was particularly pleased with the bathroom, which had both a standing, glass-enclosed shower and a separate, deep bathtub. Even better was the decision to have a window through from the bedroom to the bathroom (with shutters for those of you who prefer complete privacy), allowing natural light from the large main windows in and allowing me to leave the bathroom lights off. I appreciated this both for being able to save the electricity and for ambiance, as my visit coincided with a rare sunny day in Seattle in February, and the natural light filtering in really was more than adequate. It also helped the comparatively small room feel larger to have the bathroom more \"integrated\" with the space.

Oh yeah and as an added bonus you can see the space needle which while I did not really look at the view is a nice \"value add\" The Gym is well equipped and modern, however it is across the courtyard and not in the gym, having said that, there are umbrellas in the room either way so it does not make a difference. The bar downstairs is nice to sit downstairs and relax which I did on a couple of occasions . *If* I had to give a negative, it was that the food that I had from room service was not that great. I only ordered once (the burger) and I did not enjoy it at all. A small point as there are many other restaurants withi a couple of minutes walk (Including a couple within the same block. Last of all,is the fact that with regards to location it is pretty much close to everything.I walked everywhere. Pike Place is probably 30 minutes walk away (or probably 10 minutes by cab), with Space Needle 6 blocks away. All in all it was great, and i would most definitely recommend it and when I go back to Seattle it will be my 1st choice of Hotel", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ketchikan, Alaska", "Title": "\u201csuper nice\u201d", "Author": "kurtisak", "ReviewID": "UR95340657", "Content": "I've stayed in every \"nice\" hotel in Seattle and the Pan Pacific is by far our favorite.

We found the parking garage easily enough, but were shocked that it was $35, (yes, $35, that's not a typo) to park for 24 hours! Holy cow!...Oh well, it IS Seattle! We sucked it up and paid. Check in was extremely simple and friendly and we had to sign a waiver for our two yellow labs that we brought with us at a charge of $50 for the night. We were aware of this in advance and had no problem with it. Loved how you have to have a room keycard to activate the elevator. Awesome security feature, although this part of town doesn't feel at all unsafe. We got to our room on the third floor and were pleasantly shocked to find that they had given us an amazing room with a full on view of the Space Needle all lit up at night. Simply gorgeous. (Room #309) The room itself couldn't have been cleaner. Very modern, tasteful furnishings, and very nice comfortable beds and linens. Their down comforters were great. The bathroom literally sparkled. It was HUGE, had a cool eco-friendly water saving toilet, and very high quality, good smelling shampoo/conditioner/lotion kit. I even used the tub for a long hot soak, while watching TV (a very nice good sized newer either LCD or plasma) with the Shoji screens that separate the bedroom area from the bath wide open. Kinda cool. Further on the bath-The tub is humongous/very deep and super clean (I am not usually one to use the tub at a hotel, but...I couldn't resist) The shower was also enormous and spotless, very roomy. Light bathrobes are provided which is always nice. There was a safe, iron/ironing board etc too. Since it is a pet-friendly hotel, there were of course, large raised stainless steel doggy bowls complete with special doggy treats from the boutique doggy shop across the plaza. Nice touch to us dog lovers! Although it is very expensive, we loved having the ability to walk downstairs to pick up late night snacks at the Whole Foods Market. We only stayed for the one night, so we didn't get the chance to walk around and shop, although GREAT shopping is just blocks from this location. I can't think of a reason that we would ever need to stay at a hotel in Seattle since we live less than 30 minutes south of the city, but it definitely was a cool place to stay for a change of pace/romantic evening and I would whole-heartedly reccommend the Pan Pacific to anyone looking for a VERY nice place to stay.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evanston, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms, great service\u201d", "Author": "gileyal", "ReviewID": "UR87538869", "Content": "I visited while interviewing for a local company.

The room itself was clean and I was laid out nicely (the sleeping area was far away from the main door and the hallway) with the bathroom providing a buffer for any outside hallway noise. My only deduction on this review was the fact that I had asked for a late check when I arrived (since I checked in later in the afternoon/early evening - you could request to stay the full 24-hours from the time you checked in), the cleaning service came a few hours early before we were ready to leave. At that point, we felt rushed to pack up and leave sooner than we had planned. When we had checked out, I made it a point to explain that I had requested for a late check-out - quoting the 24-hour stay policy that was on their website - which they agreed to. This incident isn't enough for to deter me from come back - I'll just make sure that they make note of it somewhere in their systems if I request for another late check-out.

It was my first time to the city and the hotel was easy to find and under ten minutes' walk from the airport tram station in the centre of Seattle's downtown district. The room was sensational. I asked for a nice view and I was not disappointed, with the Space Needle to a hard left, and a direct line of sight of Lake Union - perfect as my stay coincided with the Independence Day fireworks. The large desk had a really comfortable chair. There was plenty of room to walk about and a good-sized wardrobe. Oodles of space. The bathroom was absolutely huge, with a full-sized separate shower and bathtub. The most unique feature of this bathroom is that it opened out in to the room. Only a sliding door and panel seal the bathroom off from the rest of the room. Not a problem for me, a solo traveller, but if you were staying with someone and you value your privacy, it's not really concealed at all. I was amazed to find that the housekeeper had bundled and neatly tied my messy cables on the desk. I thought it was a really nice touch and showed thoroughness in the service. I can't really think of many drawbacks. I booked through Expedia, which had a much cheaper rate than the hotel's own website. While they would match a price, it would only be after you made a reservation directly through them. Also, it was frustrating that there was no spoon, and only stirrers - I'm guessing this is normal in the US, but you couldn't even buy your own cereal and have it in the room.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel just north of downtown Seattle\u201d", "Author": "Trekker5211", "ReviewID": "UR70661109", "Content": "The Pan Pacific Seattle was one of the most pleasant surprises of my trip to the Northwest this summer.

I found the staff to be extremely welcoming and helpful during my stay. The hotel decor is awesome. Having said that, I was surprised to see just how many odd things there were in terms of features and functionality in such a hotel. I arrived in the room and unpacked and wanted to iron my clothes. I looked through the entire room and couldn't find it. The service guide for the hotel tells guests to touch \"Service Now\" for all needs. Alas, there is no \"Service Now\" button. So I dialed 0 and explained the situation. A housekeeper then came by with an iron and ironing board. I then walked into the bathroom and found the coffee service sitting on the ledge above the bathtub. Why would they place the coffee maker at the foot of the bathtub. Sure looks nice but it's not functional. Later that evening, I wanted to plug in my laptop and cell phone to recharge them and was looking for an outlet by the desk. I found it after crawling on the floor behind two layers of drapes. A small point, the bottle of conditioner in the shower had a small foil seal under the cap. There was no tab or any way to lift it up or puncture it. Not very functional. The reason I am mentioning these things is that it is one thing to have a hotel that looks nice. It's another thing have a hotel that functions well for a business traveler. I am partial to other national brands for this reason. Hotel rooms should have irons as a matter of course. Desks should have electrical outlets. All of this stuff is straightforward. I sent the hotel a message about these things via the hotel web site and received a voice mail apologizing for the problems and a gift certificate for one night's stay. That was a nice gesture. As far as other items, there is a 24 hour workout room across the entrance from the hotel that is available to all guests. It is equipped with cardio equipment, machines, dumbbells, and a whirlpool. There is a Starbuck's adjacent to the lobby and a Whole Foods market next to the hotel. The hotel is also part of a condo complex. Overall, the hotel is very nice aesthetically.

Plus: Room was beautiful and very nicely furnished - the bed was terrific with top quality linens and the bathroom was the best I've used at a hotel. Toiletries were nicely balanced - not over perfumed like some hotels. Service was perfect - friendly, welcoming and not intrusive. The hotel is fairly new so everything is very modern and warm. The Whole Foods downstairs comes in pretty handy - they've even stocked snack size Haagen Daaz ice cream for the late night snack. Wifi is free which many luxury hotels don't offer. Cons: $35 for valet parking is a bit rich even for a hotel like this, maybe in downtown San Francisco or New York but outside of downtown Seattle? The sink tap could be a bit easier to use - one moment there's little water pressure and the next, it's a garden hose (you get used to it though). TV is a widescreen but the programming is not.

We were subsequently contacted by Mr. Reyes, the Director of Operations, to discuss our options. He was very professional, extremely helpful and wanted to ensure that our trip was special. From the moment we arrived the staff went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was enjoyable. The accommodations were very nice, everything including the soft bath robes, the soaking tub, location and cleanliness of the hotel were exceptional. However, the staff and the efforts of Mr. Reyes really put the hotel and our stay over the top. Upon arrival we received a birthday card signed by the staff for my husband along with chocolates. Throughout the stay, the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful with recommendations and directions. The first night we ate at the restaurant next to the hotel, Sea Star. Despite the fact that it was late and we came in as they were closing, the staff was gracious and the food was great. We met Chad, the manager of the restaurant. He too was very knowledgeable about the area and other restaurants and even offered to contact a friend at the Salish Lodge, where we were having a birthday celebration for my husband the next night.

Hotel parking is expensive, but that is the case anywhere in Seattle. And their friendly valet service includes in-and-out privileges, which is nice. The main disappointment for us was the condition of the room. While generally clean and stylish, it didn't quite live up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. There were some small stains in the carpet here and there, black smudges on the cabinets, and the loveseat was the most uncomfortable piece of furniture I've encountered in a hotel! The cushion squishes down, leaving your legs hanging over the hard frame in the front. Another disappointment was the minibar policy - even in the Executive Suite there is only an area for about 4 pop cans left for personal use. The rest is electronically monitored, so that if you move one of their bottles, you pay! A note said they will remove all the drinks on request - for a fee of $35! Ridiculous. And finally, the fitness center is located in a separate building across a small courtyard. It's not far at all, but it would be a lot more convenient right inside the hotel.

It really is more of a boutique hotel and while the premium king room was nice enough, it was still rather average except perhaps for the bathroom which had a great large soaker tub and freestanding shower in it. The traffic noise from a busy bus and emergency vehicle route street is bad if the window is open and barely tolerable with it closed although it was OK for sleeping but starts up again about 6am. Be warned, there is the dreaded \"move it and it's yours\" bar fridge which is a colossal pain if you want to keep a couple of your own cold drinks in it. They'll empty it out for you for $35-that's really bush league. On the plus side, free internet and newspaper is a nice touch. Service was OK but nothing special for this class of hotel. They did deal swiftly and appropriately with a problem. Only bar is really part of an independently run attached restaurant. The location is a 15 minute walk from downtown in an area that is starting to become trendy called Belltown which is full of 20 and 30 somethings who probably work in high tech (Amazon's new offices are located nearby) and are always talking and texting on their smartphones-even in the checkout line at the attached Whole Foods which I was much more impressed with than the hotel.

Yes, it's as fabulous as everyone says. We were enthusiastically greeted every time we entered and left. Check in and out were seamless. Dinner at the Seastar restaurant was outstanding. Then there's the room. . . Room 714 faces northeast and was a very comfortable size for two people. (We could see the Space Needle if we pressed our faces to the glass and looked left.) The abundance of toiletries was a nice touch - loofah mitt, large tubes of shampoo & conditioner, bath salts for that big tub, etc. Free in-room WiFi is a BIG plus - we hate it when hotels nickel-and-dime you for internet access. We streamed music from on line, though the room is tricked out with every entertainment gadget you could want. LOCATION: Definitely not in the middle of the tourist attractions, but we liked that. A 3/4-mile walk down Lenora will put you directly on an overpass staircase/elevator that leads directly to the waterfront/Alaskan Way tourist attractions. The hotel entrance doesn't face the street and accessing the internal courtyard can be a little tricky the first time. (Enter on Terry Avenue.) 30-minute parking is allowed in the plaza for unloading. We didn't want to pay the steep valet parking fee so we saved $7/day by parking at the Pacific Place mall garage and walking back to the hotel. We used our car for dinner at Canlis on Saturday night and were able to find free on-street parking right outside the hotel when we returned. (Street parking is free after 6pm Saturday and all day Sunday - why pay for a garage?) The hotel is adjacent to the residential tower and the plaza has lots of amenities - Whole Foods, the obligatory Starbucks, dry cleaner, FedEx/Kinkos, card shop, pet store and a few nice restaurants. It felt like home away from home (rather than a tourist mecca). And Jazz Alley, Cinerama and Top Pot Doughnuts are a short walk down Lenora. I didn't use the fitness center (which was probably equally amazing) because we had awesome weather. I ran every day along the waterfront - straight down Lenora to Elliott Bay and north into Elliott Bay Park. There's a time-release water fountain about 1/2 mile in and another at the Fisherman's Pier along with public restrooms. Continue on the paved path past the grain terminal, along the cruise ship pier, follow the train tracks, around the school bus parking lot, and end in cute Smith Cove Park on the water (another time-release water fountain), which is a little over 4.5 miles from the hotel. If you head south, the rest rooms at the Seattle Ferry Terminal may come in handy. ;) HIGHLY RECOMMEND: If you've money to burn, have a phenomenal dinner at Canlis. Not to be believed. We saw the Dave Brubeck quartet at Jazz Alley, a really nice club. Don't miss the Seattle Public Library - it ain't your grandmother's library, funded by Microsoft and a technological wonder. You could easily spend an hour starting on the 10th floor & wandering down to the cafe. Bring your camera. Take a sightseeing boat tour if the weather is nice - it's the best way to see the city from a new perspective (and boat rides are just so darn romantic).", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201c5 Star !\u201d", "Author": "woodsmokeillinois", "ReviewID": "UR41961506", "Content": "Wonderful, comfortable rooms and very quiet.

It was the best chain hotel I've stayed at where you get the local feel of the city: the hallways were decorated with historical photos of old Seattle, the Space Needle featured prominently in the view (the hotel is situated to maximize the views for as many rooms as possible), the modernist glass architecture in the hotel and surrounding neighbourhood was typical Seattle, reflecting the subtle Pacific Northwest skies. The view from the courtyard looking towards the Needle is very fine. While we never ate at the hotel restaurant, the large Whole Foods store at the street level was ideal for breakfast and a fast snack. How much more Seattle can you get than drinking fresh, organic carrot juice? The upscale pizza restaurant next door was delicious. The service was attentive and genuinely friendly. The restaurant recommendations were excellent. The hotel surprised us with complimentary appetizers while we were seated at a near-by Italian restaurant. And now to location, which the previous reviewer didn't like. It's just east of the Space Needle and slightly north of downtown, about a 10-minute walk to Nordstrom's. When our bags were too full from a day of shopping the taxi fare back to the hotel was less than 5 bucks, but otherwise we walked. If one were staying in a larger city, such as New York, one wouldn't even notice such a triviality. The hotel felt as if it were in a real cool urban neighbourhood, where people actually lived, but with the benefit of being right next to the downtown core. (Silly, I know, but I could imagine Frasier neurotically pacing behind one of the penthouse windows in the surrounding condos.) We went to several local restaurants, where real Seattle people eat, which were fabulous. And so, unless you have serious mobility issues, don't let the location deter you. And even then, take a cab. The best of all was the service. I'd stupidly left my expensive telephoto lens and camera bag in my room after check-out, which I'd tucked in the night table stand. The hotel kindly shipped it to my home right away. While you're in Seattle, here's a must-see. Be sure to check out the Experience Music Project (EMP), rent the iPods and listen to the guitars in the guitar gallery.

This hotel deserves all the positive reviews it gets and although some kinks may need to be worked out the staff will always be there to take care of anything you need. We were fortunate enough to stay at this great hotel on two occasions during our trip to the Pacific Northwest. The General Manager, David Sullivan, as well as Paul, who will be the first to welcome you, and Angela at the front desk made our trip the most memorable yet. This hotel should be the top on everyone's list when you come to Seattle. First of all, the rooms on both occasions were great. Our first room was Deluxe Double facing the Needle. My two kids refused to close the curtains at night as they fell asleep with a Seattle landmark gleaming in the distance. The bathroom was also great with a nice tub that had doors above that opened up to allow you to bathe and look outside at the great view. My son and daughter took a bath every night during our stay forcing us to go to Lush at Westgate Center to by bubble bath. It was a neat feature to have that I'm sure other hotels in Seattle could not offer. On our second stay in Executive room on view was of Lake Union which was equally beautiful. The bathroom was even bigger, if possible, with a shower you could invite all your friends to. (If you are in to that!) Anyway, both rooms were spectacular. Having a Whole Foods along with two great restaurants, Seastar and Tutto Bella, come in handy after a long day of sightseeing. Also a nice feature at the hotel was the access to the free internet right near the front desk. All these things add up on along vacation and the fact we could get a good affordable meal or save on internet services helped out. These are things the big chains nickel and dime you on. Having stayed at this Pan Pacific and the Pan Pacific Village Centre in Whistler I felt we got more than our monies worth. Finally, As most reviews stated it is a couple of blocks from Westlake Center and shopping, the Space Needle, or a little bit longer to Pike Place Market but what better way to enjoy this beautiful city than to walk it. Public transportation is located steps from the hotel, the hotel has a car service, and taxis await in the parking lot for those who do not wish to take it all in. This should not be a reason to not to stay at this perfect getaway spot. We did it with two kids in the middle of a heat wave. In a very green city everyone should go out there and just walk it, unless it is raining which then the Pan Pacific will gladly give you an umbrella. Thanks to all the staff for your hospitality and we are counting the days until our family can be welcomed home again to the Pan Pacific Seattle.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "Olberto", "ReviewID": "UR38032880", "Content": "I stayed here with my wife on the first night of our honeymoon, and then again for another night ten days later.

The staff were superb, the room was beautiful - well designed, spacious, quiet, spotlessly clean and with a very comfy bed. Just to prove that it wasn't a fluke, the reception staff greeted us like old friends when we arrived for our second stay and put us in a suite on the 8th floor. A bottle of wine from the manager arrived soon afterwards. Obviously honeymooners do sometimes get a bit of special treatment but it was the attitude of this hotel which impressed me. Some hotels clearly don't care about their guests, some hotels do a good job of pretending to care about their guests and some hotels genuinely go the extra mile to create a positive experience for their guests. PP Seattle is well and truly in the latter category. In summary, two perfect stays at this superb hotel. I would not hesitate to stay there again. ps.

The hotel was located in a convenient location - you can easily walk to Pike's or the Space Needle within 10 to 15 minutes from the hotel. It is also convenient to any of the downtown area and you walk through some of it on the way down to the Market. The hotel is also situated with a few businesses adjacent to the property which is convenient if you need food, drink, etc. The best is the Whole Foods Market which the hotel sits on top of - I am still going through withdrawals not having one near me in Florida. There is also a Bank of America, Starbucks, drug store, mail/packaging shop all within one minute of the lobby doors. I upgraded the room to the Space Needle KIng room. The room was on a low floor but still had fantastic views of the Needle. There is apparently only one of these rooms per floor - each one on the corner of the building facing the Needle. This gives you an entire side of the room (including bathroom areas) that face the Space Needle. While a higher room would have been nice, the view was still great. Our friends did not have the upgrade and while they could \"see\" the Needle, it was only by looking out sharply to the left. We, on the other hand, could lay in bed looking out towards it - there was no place in the room you could not see it unless it was foggy. The hotel was immaculately clean - probably one of the best kept properties I've been to including some Ritz's, etc. The bed was amazingly comfortable. Negatives? Yes, a few but they were minor. First, the TV programming is difficult to use and figure out. And checking out online from room proved to be frustrating and impossible. I also had just left the front desk where I made arrangements for a taxi to take us to the cruise terminal and when I got up to the room to checkout, the door keys were deactivated. I went back down, got the keys reactivated and went up to get the bags and checkout. That's when I had the issue with the online checkout. So, upon visiting the desk the third time in a half hour (the same person), he looked at me like he did not recognize me at all. So that was a little odd - but the hotel did allow me to check out a bit later so I was able to overlook this as a minor problem. Would I stay there again?

First, the hotel does not have an ice machine but the will gladly send ice complimentary to your room if you ask. I this is an important point, it is amazing what happens if you just ask for something. Also, parking. Yes, if you do park in the garage it is $33.00 a night.

The gym- it is really across a beautiful courtyard not a street and it is not far at all. It is very nice and accessible 24 hours with your room key.

This time, I had more of an opportunity to explore the hotel and environs, and this is really a good choice in Seattle. First, the hotel rooms are cleverly designed, quite comfortable, with beautiful and pristine bathrooms. I had a corner suite looking toward the Space Needle, and the view was great. Last time I only saw the street and an old building, so this view was much better (and I actually paid less this time and was upgraded). The bed is incredibly comfortable, although the room would have benefitted from a good easy chair. The desk chair was very good, but the other chair was more decorative than inviting. The gym is awesome! If you like to work out, you won't want to leave the gym. It's not huge, but larger than most hotel gyms and the equipment is state-of-the-art. I felt like I got as good a workout as I do at home, and you can't get that at most hotel gyms (and it's free!). It, too, was spotless and open 24-7. It's about a 7-10 minute walk to the central city/Pike Place Market, but not bad and safe. There is also a tram if you don't mind paying $1.75 to ride a few blocks. Right at the hotel is a terrific Whole Foods and Starbucks can be accessed from the lobby (it's a real Starbucks, not the hotel kind). If you want to get out of town for the day, there is an Enterprise Car Rental office just a block from the hotel. My only complaints about the room were that the sink doesn't drain (happened on both visits - it's a design flaw) and at night all the tv/dvr/dvd equipment and fridge make noise and there are some lights that kind of blink on and off. Also, the clock by the bed is a retro tick-tock clock, not a digital clock like you usually see in hotels. It was cute but a little loud - I stashed it in the closet.

If we could afford it, I would not stay at any other hotel but this one. Draw back would be that we could not find a garage in the area (even though they did say they had one), so we were pretty much forced to get vallet, but to my understanding, to use of the garage and vallet are pretty much the same price. Also drawbacks, no fridge. You have a minibar, but youre not able to put any of your stuff in there, unless you wanna chance it and get charged for opening the bar or moving something inside.

We've heard good things about the hotel, so when we got a $110/night rate through Travelzoo, we thought we'd give it a shot. We easily found street parking and walked a couple of blocks to the hotel. The lobby was very pretty, both the general design and the Christmas decorations. Check-in was very easy. The person at the check-in desk was helpful, making sure we had parking, seeing if we needed to make any dinner reservations, and asking if we'd like a morning paper. Our room was located on the 7th floor, which is about halfway up in the building. We had a view of Lake Union, which wasn't anything spectacular, but pretty nice. The weather in Seattle in December is a little too gloomy to do much gazing out the window anyway. We had a deluxe room, with a queen bed,which is the lowest on the totem pole for this hotel. The room was a good size with a desk, chaise lounge, bed and dresser. The TV was a large one, with many stations to watch. The bathroom is huge with gorgeous marble counters, a beautiful tiled shower and the most amazing soaking tub. The toiletries in the room were nice, and even included bath gel, which I put to good use in the big tub. As others have mentioned, the bathroom is open to the bedroom, but has sliding covers for the large window opening between the two rooms. This makes the room seem even larger, which is nice, but it also means that the bathroom is very unsoundproof, which is not my favorite thing on a romantic weekend getaway. The room also had a coffee pot and coffee, which is always nice. The mini-bar fridge has a small space that's for personal use, which I thought was a good touch. We also took advantage of the full-sized grocery store downstairs, picking up some snacks and drinks there to have up in our room.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston Salem, NC", "Title": "\u201cLovely eclectic hotel\u201d", "Author": "WSNCtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR22820935", "Content": "The Pan Pacific Seattle is a very nice hotel.

Upon check in, the hotel staff sent us fruit and water since it was our anniversary, which we agreed was very thoughtful and refreshing since we'd been traveling all day. If you imagine a triangle, the hotel is one point of the triangle, the Space Needle is another point (roughly 10-15 mins on foot), and the city the third point (15 mins on foot). So, we felt this hotel was in a great location to see all of Seattle. Our room faced Lake Union so it had a decent view and our camera got some great shots of the lake and also a small view of the Space Needle. Everything was within walking distance and the hills were irrelevant, but then again we're pretty well-traveled and used to walking on foot. Our room was on the 8th floor and construction noise was not noticeable at all, even though we were almost on even surfaces with the building being built across Denny Way. Also, we did not hear any traffic below except the occasional police car going by. The hotel staff at this hotel are exceptional. They answered all our questions, helped with directions, helped with taxis, helped suggest GREAT places to eat--and I mean GREAT! The hotel decor is very modern but very comfortable and classy. The housekeeping staff were prompt and sufficient. The hotel bar was definitely adequate in size. The Whole Foods market down below was perfect for our breakfast. They have a small bar area for hot breakfast they prepare while you wait. The hours of the market were great, we were out all day and coming back late at night for juice and snacks was perfect, even on Sunday evening. Also, they have great coffee at Whole Foods. I'd recommend WF before the Starbucks next to the hotel, but the staff at SB were also very friendly and made good coffee. My husband and I ate at Tutta Bella next to the hotel and the pizza was delicious!! Every time we left the hotel we could smell this pizza, so we felt we had to try it. The hotel does have small fridges in the room--even though they're hidden in the photos you may see because they look like a cabinet. The fridge does have room for your own personal groceries, the largest item we got in the fridge was a half gallon of orange juice, so you could probably get a few smaller items in without problem. In all, we would definitely recommend this hotel to all travelers and we ourselves cannot wait to return again. If you feel like climbing a hill, climb Denny Way outside the hotel about 5-6 blocks to Yale North Ave. and try Espresso Vivace....absolutely was the best coffee we had while in Seattle (or perhaps ever) and unfortunately we found this coffee shop on our last day in the city.

I LOVED this place and I've traveled all over the world. The most pleasant thing about the PanPacific is the design - it is sleek, Asian-inspired, elegant and it is only 2 years old so it has the feeling of being new. The place just oozed relaxation and comfort. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, not pretentious at all. Many of the other guests were international travelers, many from Asia, some from Africa. The room was wonderful - I can't say enough about the great design. The bed was heavenly. The flat screen TV was amazing. Wifi worked great with no problem at all. There was a Japanese-like screen that separated the bathroom from the bedroom that could be opened up, giving the room a much more spacious feel than most hotel rooms. The room could have been bigger in size, but it is an urban hotel and thus one can't expect lots of space with a regular, non-suite room. The tub and shower in the bathrooms were fabulous. Endless amounts of hot water, great water pressure. The room included a safe and a mini-bar. We also had a nice sized desk and a chaise lounge. The room service food was delicious! We had 3 breakfasts and a dinner through room service. (We got a room deal that included room service breakfast for $20/adult/day.) Some of the best food we ate in Seattle was room service at this hotel! But the piece de resistance was the Vida Spa. I love spas and I usually get a massage wherever I travel, plus regular visits to the spa at home. The Vida was divine! I have truly never been to a spa like this before. The room that you wait for your masseuse in is dark, quiet, and so dramatic- there is a long rectangular window with a line of flames flaring upwards. All the chairs seat facing the fire. And the white leather chair I sat upon was one of the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in. I relaxed so much before I even saw my masseuse! The massage I had was outstanding! For the life of me I can't remember her name but she was quite young, petite, with shoulder-length dark hair, slender. The lady at the front desk accomodated a last minute request to change the time of my massage. My visit to this spa really added so much to the overall stay at the Pan Pacific that I would *highly recommend* going, even if you are not the type that usually goes to the spa. Trust me - this is not to be missed. My husband and I had our 3 year old son with us. The hotel is not the kind of place one would normally take a young child as it doesn't cater to kids. But the staff were extremely friendly and sweet towards him. Also, our son loved the hotel because he loves elevators and escalators. There are two public outdoor escalators in the plaza just outside the hotel. Also in the plaza is a Starbucks coffee, Whole Foods, an upscale pet store, a tobacco/cigar store, and more. There was so much to see and do in Seattle that we will definitely come back and will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific. Even though it is a little further away from downtown than many of the other hotels, it is definitely worth the extra walk or short cab ride. This hotel has set a new standard for me for hotels in this price range. I absolutely loved it. My husband, who is thrifty and cost-conscious, was initially uncertain about staying here but did it because I was so eager about it. Even he enjoyed himself and is willing to go back and spend the extra money for all the amenities and overall luxury experience.

On both I was disappointed, and I don't consider myself too picky about hotels. The hotel is extremely hard to find. To find the hotel, it would have been helpful to know that I should drive into the Westlake condo complex rather than look for a hotel entrance. Don't rely on GoogleMaps, it has the hotel in the wrong place. The parking ($28/day plus tips for valet) seemed expensive. There is self-parking next to the Whole Foods right on Westlake Ave., but the front desk told me valet parking was actually more reasonable for guests. The hotel is outside of actual downtown, about a 15-20 minute walk to Nordstrom/Macy's in a classy multi-use condo complex with a Whole Foods right below it (great for snacks). This area appears to be transforming into a new upscale high-rise residential area, but there is little visitor activity in this vicinity. There is a LOT of construction going on, with one high rise right across the street going up. Perhaps all the construction is reflected in the daily rate of the hotel, but the thick glass keeps out most of the noise. A lot of other Seattle hotels are much closer if you will be going to the Farmer's Market or shopping as a tourist. That said, there is a GREAT Italian restaurant recommended by the hotel about 2 blocks away called Barolo. Absolutely outstanding food and service, and the best food we had in Seattle during our stay. Our modern room was enormous and a gorgeous Japanese-onsen (spa) inspired bathroom. Windows in the bathroom were huge, but of clear glass (even in the toilet room!) so we kept the blinds tilted or closed for privacy. Separate shower and bathtub. Shoji-inspired doors slide open if you want to make the bathroom part of the bedroom. Beds were decent, but not of Westin or Four Seasons caliber. There were a LOT of b-i-g stains and dirt on the carpeting, something I would not expect of a luxury hotel. Because there are two handles placed right next to each other on the very edge of the wardrobe closet doors, I smashed my fingers in the handles daily. Strangely, there was only one upholstered chair in our room, so one person always had to sit on the bed. Service at the front desk and valet was caring, prompt and courteous. The dramatic, clean-lined modern lobby is of the latest urban design using a lot of zebra wood paneling. The hotel serves breakfast in the AM for its guests in the bar. Price for a luxury hotel is not unreasonable, about $15 for an egg omelette, coffee extra. This Whole Foods also serves breakfast: you order at cashier and they bring the food to you.

If you love modern, contemporary design and architecture, Asian flair, unique room layout, then you may well love this hotel. However, if you value function over form, you may be very disappointed. If you want to call \"Service One\" (i.e., the concierge button) for a bucket of ice, and don't mind waiting 15 to 30 minutes for your ice, this is your place. If you would rather walk down the hall and have the bucket of ice in 2 or 3 minutes, you will be disappointed. If you want to walk out and get into your car and drive away, stay elsewhere. If you don't mind $28 per night for parking, plus a valet tip, plus 10 to 30 minute wait to get your car, this place will be fine. The room is about the same size as any major-chain hotel, but the layout is quite different. The bathroom is much larger, with a separate tub and really nice shower. The toilet is unique: \"half flush\" and \"full flush\" buttons (made by Caroma in Australia, http://www.caroma.com.au/index.html). The shower head is a great Kohler unit that supplies a soft, wide, drench. The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by sliding \"screens\": open is nearly useless, as the toilet is visible from the bed. Closed is ok, but the bathroom is not really separate from the bedroom, but more like a toilet with a bed sheet for privacy. This form/function conflict appears numerous places: a wonderful, round, retro clock that goes tick-tock, but uses \"glow-in-the-dark\" hands that, about 10 minutes after the lights go out, cannot be read. Wake up in the middle of the night and you cannot tell what time it is. The bedroom has a contemporary work desk, ergonomic chair (entirely out-of-place with its all-plastic construction), tiny round end table, and \"chaise\" sofa suitable for one person. We had room service dinner one night, and there was no place to simply sit and eat. Tray on the desk, service on the chaise/chair/bed. Very uncomfortable. Oh, and they forgot to give us any type of table napkins with dinner -- we could have called down again, but used face clothes from the bathroom rather than wait for them to bring napkins while our food got cold. Finally, the \"service one\" button on the phone gets prompt answering, but very erratic response. I was here with several acquaintances in other rooms, and we all had ice buckets take from 10 minutes to 1 hour, car valet service from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, etc. Summary: if you value form over function, you may love this place.

The room had a fantastic view of the Space Needle which was fun for my son. I really hav no complaints save for the water pressure in the shower was a little anemic. Which is strange considering some of the other reviews mentioned that their water pressure was too much - go figger. Anyway, if you cn book this for under $200 it is a STEAL. Even above that price the Pan Pacific is a quality place. We got a very preferable rate, (let's just say it was under $150 per night) and I would highly recommend it.

My wife and I went with another couple on Dec. 27 to 29, 2007 and, with a few minor negatives, we found the overall stay to be excellent. We booked through hotels.ca, and got a rate of $183 CDN per night, including all taxes & charges (parking extra). This seemed like a very good rate for such a nice hotel. First, the negatives: there was poor lighting in the bathroom for shaving, and poor lighting in the bedroom for reading. And the walk-in shower had no flow control - the shower head felt like a pressure washer, and it flooded the bathroom floor (poorly designed shower curtain, and no floor curb). We aren't \"fussy\" travellers, and I wouldn't normally complain about this type of stuff (and didn't mention it to the hotel staff) but I wanted to give an accurate review. The positives more than made up for the negatives: a very quiet room, with a very comfortable bed; nicely decorated, clean room; large soaker tub, and large flat screen TV (we didn't watch it, but it is there if you want it). The numerous staff were attentive, friendly and very helpful. Normally, I could care less about the lobby (who spends time there?) but in the cold weather, it was nice to wait for people in the cozy chairs by the fireplace. There was a fair walk (say 6 blocks or more) to the Belltown area (restaurants, bars, etc.) through non-touristy areas, but not at all threatening - we appreciated the walk after the great meals we ate, so not an issue, but it might be a problem for people who are not as mobile. But, we were right on the streetcar route, which will take people quickly to the downtown area where free buses run. A couple other items: try the Tavolata restaurant (2323 Second Ave.) but get there by 6:30 or expect to wait. If you are a microbrew fan, try the Pike Place Bar & Grill - several good beers to choose from. One final complaint: Parking at the Pan Pacific: $28 per night - I found that a bit rich.

Location & Convenience: Although a bit out of the main downtown area, it is an easy walk or a cab ride to downtown shopping, museums and pike place market. You can take the new trolley for free that stops right outside the hotel and it takes you to downtown shopping areas so this was very convenient. Also, as others have mentioned, Whole Foods Market is just beneath the hotel as well as Starbucks, which is actually connected to the hotel through a side door. I'd rate 4 out of 5 for location and 5 stars for convenience. Room: We had the king room which had simplistic modern design with very good bathroom layout. There was Asian style sliding doors that would open up the sunken bathtub to your bed which made the room feel much bigger than what it actually was. Bed was very comfortable with very good pillows too (possibly on par with Campton Place in San Francisco) . Bed and bath are always a high priority on our vacation and Pan Pacific Seattle delivered. The only complaint I would have is the bath amenities, although plentiful, should be of better quality. 4.5 stars. Service: I have to give 5 stars on this as everyone was eager to help and it showed. Although a tad inexperienced as would be expected for a new hotel, service as a whole was very good. Personally, we hate the gigantic hotel chains as the service can slake off but this one was well proportioned with just enough rooms to accommodate their guests needs. Room service food was above par but selection wasn't abundant. Quality wise, I'd rank 4 stars. Extra tips: Since the hotel is fairly new, our cab driver from the airport did not know where it was located, even his GPS navigator did not pick it up. We were lucky that I had remembered the address... also, it took about 30 minutes for the taxi to arrive in the early morning of our departure. If you're taking a cab from the airport to the hotel or vice versa, take the Orange cab since they have a flat rate.
