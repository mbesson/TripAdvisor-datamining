As well as un-vacuumed in the corners (there was even a toothpick laying on the floor) -unclean shower and ripped towels. -their idea of pillows are fabric bags stuffed with foam. -restaurants are shoving their menus through the door everyday -AC broken -dirty walls, bathrooms,microwaves,tvs,tables, -couch/pull-out bed had a MASSIVE burn hole in it. Luckily we didn't have to use it. -Even in a Non-smoking room we can smell smoke. -the walls are so thin we can hear a conversation in the other room -continental breakfast includes cereal, old pastries, and gross coffee--I bring my own coffee down from the room since... -you can't eat the breakfast in your own room. -The building structure seems to be falling a part and the whole 4th floor is on an angle. Finally, the only good things: friendly staff the amenities are convientient (even tho gross) free parking and Wi-Fi I understand that this is a franchise and we can't just change reservations from one location to another, but the Howard Johnson name (under the 'proud members of the Wyndham Worldwide family) should take responsibility for their hotels!

Although I am not sure where the free breakfast was, which was advertised on the big neon sign outside. The room and bathroom were reasonably clean etc etc, despite the rather noisy freeway view. It was just the lack of decent hotel standards and the seriously bad attitude of the staff who worked there which shocked both myself and my colleague. The first night, I stayed on the fold out coach in my colleague's room. You would think that, being a hotel, they would have perhaps, a few extra pillows and a few sheets. No. 'We're out of pillows,' the woman behind the desk said rudely. I was given one poor quality blanket and the last sheet. So far so bad. The next night was worse. During the day, the cleaner had taken all my bedding and folded the couch back up, so we had to call down for more sheets, blankets and maybe that all-elusive pillow. It was about ten o'clock at night. 'I'm really sorry about that madam. I'll send a sheet, pillow and blanket up to your room in ten minutes,' said the voice at the end of the phone. More than 20 minutes pass. No bedding. So I call reception and speak to another man who tells me 'no room service past ten o'clock'. Of course, I explained to him that the cleaner had caused us inconvenience, that his colleague had promised to send up the bedding. Mid explanation, the man hung up on me. So, fairly irritated, I went down the five flights of stairs (didn't want to risk the creaky elevator) only to interrupt another complaint by a lady and her husband. She was, quite reasonably, asking for a new sheet for her bed as it was dirty. She also needed some extra pillows for her kids' bed. 'We have no more sheets,' the man behind the desk said, rudely. 'We have no pillows.' He handed me, what turned out to be the last sheet, while the perplexed lady quite rightly asked him what the hell was going on. This was a hotel wasn't it? Didn't they have extra bedding? Most hotels would give you more than you need. She pointed out she'd spent $170 for the room. Deskman started getting angry. 'I didn't charge you for the extra bed in your room. You can go somewhere else if you don't like it.' By now it was midnight. The woman was speechless and began to protest. 'I think I have every right to complain if the hotel room is dirty, I've stayed at other budget hotels and...' Deskman then lost it. 'I am not renting out room to you. You make trouble. You leave.' 'But my two kids have moved in,' the woman said, flabbergasted. 'We can't leave now.' The pair then proceeded to have a mini tug of war over the blanket and sheet on the desk. I advised her to complain about this in the morning for fear of the poor woman being chucked out of her room with two kids in the early hours with nowhere to go. The standard of service in this place was shocking. The staff did not appear to give a damn about their paying guests.

I'm most disappointed w/HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL, booked by a travel agency who won't recommend them again. They don't care about what they did...

I got the chance last week when I was sent down for training. Training was to be held in the Doubletree thats just a few doors down (walking distance easy). My first reaction upon finding the \"hotel\" was, \"Are you serious?\" As I entered the \"lobby\", I was greeted by a life-size statue of Hulk Hogan... very classy I thought to myself. Checked in fine and as I make my way up the elevator and around the catwalk that wraps around the building 4 stories up, (sorry, scared of heights) I began to hope that my room would make up for what the \"hotel\" lacked in curb appeal. My hopes were crushed as I opened the door and the smell of smoke filled my nose and my eyes adjusted to the dark cave-like room. The room was small, very small, the bed was only a full (maybe a booking issue with personnel) and the lock on the door had to be jimmied in order to actually lock. What do you expect for $59 per night? Although, in all fairness to the \"hotel\", They did have a small fridge and a microwave in the room. The shower had also recently been re-tiled which was actually kinda nice. Would I ever stay there again?

We only got about 2 hours of sleep the first night and 4 hours of sleep the next night. Not because of the noise, but because of the lack of comfort in this hotel. Our first room had so much mold in the bathroom that I had an asthma attack within 1 hour of being in there. We requested another room, only to have that room have no air conditioning. When going back to our original room, the cleaners had come in during our supposed transition into a new room and sprayed something that made the asthma so bad that I couldn't even enter the room. So we ended up with a 3rd try for a room. The 3rd room had mold as well but I requested them to not send anyone in to clean it - that I would clean it myself! Otherwise - we would have been searching for room number 4. The carpets in our first room and then our 3rd room were so dirty that the bottoms of my feet turned black within 2 hours of walking in the room barefoot. You may ask why we didn't leave the hotel? Well - the rooms were already paid for by credit card and we were tied into that hotel or we would lose the monies we paid and we couldn't afford that. We were so disgusted with the hotel that we ended up leaving the hotel at 7:00 AM to drive back home to Arizona and deal with the heat instead of staying in San Diego for the rest of the day and driving home that night. We thought Howard Johnson's was a 3 star hotel - with the rates we paid - it should have been. Next time we drive to San Diego, we will stay in a 4-Star hotel. The last time we drove to San Diego, 2 years ago, we stayed in a better hotel that was closer to the beach for considerably cheaper than this one. It was rated a 2 and was cleaner than this one. Manager wasn't around - we received no compensation or discount for these dirty rooms.

First, and worst, the room smelled like urine. It did not reak, exactly, but it was a strong enough smell that I could not put it out of my mind. It made the stay unpleasant, as you can imagine. Second, the ancient coffee pot in the room did not work. I asked if they could replace it or swap me one from a different room. I was told that there were no other coffee pots available. They also told me they did not have any ceramic/glass mugs, when I asked, in order to heat water in the microwave. (The alternative was to heat the water in styrofoam cups in the microwave). Since I got such a bad response on the coffee pot problem, I did not even try to get a different room with a better smell. Also, a minor point, breakfast was lousy, although that is not a big deal, given the price of the room. But for these problems, the price and in-room fridge and microwave would have made the deal okay. The furnishings and cleanliness were not otherwise terrible for a budget place. By the way, don't stay on Hotel Circle if you plan beach time. It was a good location for visiting the University of San Diego, but I don't know what else. There is a lot of traffic noise, although the air conditioner will drown that out for the most part. Any lure of an outdoor pool on this road should be ignored, since it is no fun playing in the pool with loud traffic noises very nearby.", "Date": "April 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot the best\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2882832", "Content": "Stayed @ this motel Dec 6 & 7, 2004.

Sleeping past 7 am was impossible unless you are a really heavy sleeper. Did not feel particularly safe @ this establishment. Door to the room was accessible from the exterior of the property & although the door did have a lock it did not close very tightly. Breakfast consisted of toast or stale cereals & pastries. I understand that for the rate we paid we wouldn't get the Ritz, but would expect the bedding to be free of stains, the carpet to be relatively clean, the doors to close properly & the complimentary breakfast to be semi-fresh.

The hotel was a bit hard to find as Hotel Circle is a complicated setup. Once we found the hotel, we could easily navigate back to it. Our room was on the second floor near the elevator. It was very spacious and clean. A refrigerator, microwave and safe in the room were all available to us. The air conditioner was loud for me, making sleeping difficult, but not for the other 3 members of my family. There was little space to put toiletries in the bathroom and little space to hang towels. The pool and hot tub are small yet very enjoyable for my 2 children. The continental breakfast provided daily was great! Several choices of bulk cereal (no little boxes here!), juices, milk, canned fruit, coffee and pastries (not the freshest, though) The breakfast is available in a large room with plenty of seating and a TV to watch the morning news. A USA Today is available free in the lobby each morning. There are machines near the elevator that sell snacks and bottled water. Outlet plus were lacking (as they were in each of the 4 hotels we stayed at during our California trip) so I would recommend bringing a power strip if you have things you want to charge.
