The free breakfast was typical Hampton--fine, unpretentious--though the eating area was tee-niny. The area is pretty dead at night, but there were at least five restaurants open w/in a two block radius. Stellas was great.

I was patient, but that didn't seem to matter. He did ask if I was staying for business or pleasure, and I responded business. He then put me in room 103, which is literally in the basement. They call it the cellar, I call it lame. I did ask to be moved, but the guy at the front desk said there wasn't anything available until the next morning. So a little about the cellar - You can hear the ice machine running most of the night, you hear anyone purchasing from the vending machines, and you hear the cleaning people early in the morning. In addition, the person that sets-up the breakfast station for the morning crowd has to come down there to get ice, which sounds like a handful of quarters in a dryer - this happened around 4:30 or 5 a.m. In addition to the creep factor of staying in the basement and all of the noise, when I went to use my hairdryer in the morning, it was broken. I did call the front desk to ask for another, to which they replied, \"We don't have portable hairdryers.\" At this point, I'd really had enough and asked for another room. They did give me another room, and I moved my stuff to the 9th floor. It seemed odd to me that a room was available at 8 a.m., but not the night before. So I didn't really believe the guy at the front desk from the night before. The new room had a lovely view, but it was definitely a smoker\u2019s room, and had a stale smoke smell. The room was fine, and the morning staff was far more helpful. I wouldn't recommend staying in the Cellar, although the one redeeming quality was that it had a small patio. Unfortunately, when I was there it was about 17 degrees outside, and it was completely unusable.

They said that as long as the occupiers of a room on the top floor didn't extend their stay we could change to this room. It had a queen bed not a king but this was fine by us.The folks left their room, we packed up our belongings & the staff moved our suitcase on our behalf, again thank you very much. The room was perfect & had great views, a bonus which was really appreciated, again thank you. The breakfasts were upto the fresh, plentiful & varied standard that we have come to expect from the Hampton chain. The breakfast seating area isn't that big as has been reported previously but enough room for everyone each morning that we were there. The bedrooms & bathrooms were SPOTLESS & beds so comfortable which is another reason we stay at the Hampton chain. One evening we were too tired to eat out & the concierge gave us a take-out menu for a nearby pizza place. It was delivered on time & was hot, tasty & very good value. We asked various questions re local info etc of the staff & the replies were always useful, helpful & delivered in a professional yet friendly manner, as though they were pleased we wanted to stay at their hotel. A special 'thank you' to Marcos for all his assistance. The free use of internet (another reason we stay at Hampton Inns) was useful to check-in online for our return flights home. It's located near the front entrance so no real privacy but this didn't matter on this ocassion. The only downside was when we booked a car, via the front desk, to take us back to JFK. We thought that this would be advisable as we didn't know if any cabs would take us becasue a lot of the cab drivers change shift at 4pm & we booked our cab for 3.30pm. The car arrived promptly but when we shut all the car doors it reeked of smoke. The driver then spent more than a third of the journey on his cell phone. I wouldn't book a car again as lots of cabs were going past & I'm sure we would have found one to take us to JFK. I did report this back to the hotel but I didn't have a reply.

First off, I must say the hotel is very clean and the staff incredibly friendly. My wife and I got there at around noon and were told my assigned room was not ready yet, and in fact the people hadn\u2019t checked out yet (this was not a big deal to me since check in was 3 PM and I was just hoping to get a room earlier). They said if we wanted a room now, we could get one on the main hotel floor otherwise wait till check in. Since we had flown in on a red eye from San Francisco we opted for the room available now. Needless to say it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in, even for New York standards it seemed small, the door to the room almost touched the bed. We were about 50 feet from the check in desk and it was just plain noisy at all hours of the day. We were woken up by lobby nose both nights from arriving guests between midnight and 3 am several times (it seemed like people coming home from parties or a late night) who didn\u2019t realize people might actually be sleeping. It was downright ridiculous. I would have changed rooms after the first night, but because we were there for only 2 nights it was too much of a hassle. Also the room had a window that looked onto the balcony of two other rooms, and there were no privacy curtains, just drapes. So you had no choice but to close the curtains if you wanted privacy. I\u2019m use to most hotels having sheers and then curtains, but not this room, so basically we had to keep the drapes closed at all times. Also there were only 3 outlets available in the whole room. Two in the bathroom and one at the desk, all others were used and behind furniture. So trying to charge two computers and cell phones was nearly impossible, plus you had to work at the desk if you needed to plug in. For a newer hotel and a Hampton I was very surprised at the lack of plugs. My main issue was the noise; I imagine if we were on a different floor, I would have been happier.

The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathroom is quite large, and always well-stocked.

The breakfast buffet is quite okay, though my wife being vegetarian would have welcomed some hot meal options for her. Every day there are two hot meal choices, usually sausages and eggs, but otherwise the bar is well stocked with fruit juices, bagels, bread, fruit, cereal, and tea, coffee and hot chocolate is availabel 24 hours a day! The hotel is also in a safe neighborhood adjacent to the South Street Seaport and about a 5 minute walk from the subways, both the A train that connects to JFK thru the Air Train and the cross-town 1,2,3 trains for the rest of Manhattan. We walked the streets quite safely even after 10pm at night, and returned home after 1am on New Year's Eve, and it was quite safe. Within walking distance is the Financial District, Battery Park, and Ground Zero, and the rest of Manhattan in minutes thru subways.

I've stayed in the area but never at this hotel. At that rate you'd normally expect luxury, but this week all of the hotels were equally expensive and many had no availability at all. The Hampton Inn offered warm cookies on check in, a clean room with a comfortable bed, and a clean bathroom. The sheets were a bit scratchy but clean, and the bed was comfortable. The flat screen tv saves space in the small room. In the morning, there was a free warm (not quite hot) and continental breakfast available, with \"grab & go\" bags if you're on the run. The \"fitness center\" consists of one treadmill and one bike, so if you're expecting a workout, stay elsewhere. I did not find the area noisy...in fact it's a bit deserted, but there are a few restaurants around and the Metro is very close. One downside was a colleague was shut out of the hotel due to \"maintenance\" on his room (read: oversold) but the hotel, to its credit, gave him a voucher to stay at the Express, not far away. Also, a couple of the rooms are actually on the basement level, so beware. Nonetheless, I would stay at this hotel again.

He gave us detailed directions to everywhere we wanted to go. The front desk staff and everyone else was very nice. The only negative was that the way the rooms were situated was such that all room doors on a floor opened into a common area - there was no hallway. So, if people are going out for a nightcap at 1,2,3am, you can easily hear slamming doors, cell phone conversations, etc...this is more of a \"heads up\" not a reason not to stay here at all. Also, the location was good for history buffs (wall St., financial area, 9/11 memorial area, south street seaport) but we didn't really find a whole lot to do within a short walk from the hotel. There were 2 subway stops close by, and both were easy to get to and made transport into mid/upper Manhattan easy.

We spent a week here using it as a base for seeing the sights in New York City. The hotel is located at the south end of Manhattan Island next to the northern ramp for the Brooklyn Bridge. There are a number of Metro stations within a 5-10 minute stroll so getting into the bustle of mid-town NY was no problem. In an evening we elected to return by taxi which, from the tourist spots of Times Square and Madison Sq Garden, cost us $12-14. Just around the corner from the hotel is pier 17. Since the fish markets closed down a few years ago the area has been redeveloped and includes many restaurants, shops, bars and has stunning views of Brooklyn Bridge. The Staten Island Ferry terminal is a 10 minute walk away along the pier front and the ferry terminals for Liberty and Ellis Islands are a couple of minutes further on. Before we booked the hotel we did wonder if a more central location would be better suited for a NY visit but in hindsight we know we made the right choice. Getting from the hotel to any of the tourist hotspots was very easy. Our room was functional and fairly compact by European standards but for what we wanted, somewhere to crash at the end of a busy day, it served it's purpose well. The room was modern, immaculately turned out, thoughtfully decorated and very relaxing. The bed was something else though and without question the comfiest bed we have ever slept in. There was an en suite bathroom which was clean and fresh. The view from the window was that of the back wall of the building behind the hotel but we didn't expect anything else and it was of no concern to us. The hotel staff are friendly, approachable and helpful. Marco the doorman is a mine of useful information for the tourist! There is a light, self service breakfast supplied in a small dining room next to reception which consisted of Cereals, Coissants, DIY toast, doughnuts (for breakfast??!!) fruit, yoghurts, tea and coffee plus various hot items which changed daily.

Upon entering the room, it was obvious that no housekeeping had been performed since the departure of the previous occupants. We then had to move our bags to another room.

Glad I switched from my first choice of a usual mid-town hotel to this one. We were looking for something near SoHo as we were meeting up with friends coming in from LA who booked their hotel at 60 Thompson ($$$). We wanted to be close but couldn't afford those rates. We paid $197 + tax for the Hampton Inn! The Hampton Inn is right next to the South Street Seaport and the water taxi. Loved being down by the water...its just a totally different atmosphere. The staff was wonderful and very accomodating. Can't say enough good things about them. Complimentary breakfast in the morning that you can even take up to your room with you. They were kind enough to keep our bags at check-out and even hold my left overs from the restaurant for me in their hotel fridge til we were ready to get our car and drive back home. Parking was only $20.00 a night right across the street. Very convenience and for NYC extremely cheap. I'm used to paying $50 a night minimum, so this was a great deal. We all took the night time Manhattan Yacht at Pier 59 (Chelsea Piers) cruise around lower manhattan. Well worth the $50 a ticket. Highly recommend. Amazing views and they right in front of the Statue of Liberty. Cool to see at night. They go under the Brooklyn Bridge, go a little further and then turn around. Afterwards had dinner at Pellegrino's in Little Italy about a mile or so away. Again, well worth the money. Amazing food. Next day took a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and that was pretty cool. A mututal friend of ours who used to live there, told us that there was an amazing pizza place under the Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn. They were right. Right under the Bridge is Grimaldi's Pizza. Plan on waiting at least 30-40 minutes outside for a table. I'm not a waiting person, but it was worth it and there was shade and a breeze.
