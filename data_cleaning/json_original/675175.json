Clean and good quality for it's price. Easy to reach and well connected with the centre of Rome, even at nights. Located in a quiet area, 10 minutes trip by tram or bus from Termini station. In the rooms equpiped with hot water boiler, make sure it's turned on! If I happen to visit that area again, I will surely stay there.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSensible Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mark E", "ReviewID": "UR126539278", "Content": "Great little budget out of the way hotel. Hotel is very clean and the rooms are adequate. Very close to frequent trams and buses and a 20 minute walk to the nearest metro.

Well worth a stay.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antalya, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cgood\u201d", "Author": "Seyran07", "ReviewID": "UR122221331", "Content": "4-5 km away from city center but only 10 steps away from tram station.

THE HOTEL : - PRO : The hotel is clean.It has 4 stories and has an Elevator.There is nothing fancy about the hotel but it`s clean.You have free WI-FI in your room as well as free Internet Access(one PC) in the lobby(you need to ask for user name and password). - CON : Some people might find this hotel a bit small. THE ROOMS : (I stayed in a TRIPLE ROOM) - PRO : The rooms are big enough for a comfortable stay.There is a small LCD TV in the room.The rooms are basically clean and tidy.The room has A/C and sun blinds.The Bathroom is big enough ,there are NO PROBLEMS with hot water and it`s clean.There is also a mini fridge in the room that has water and juice(extra pay). - CON : There is no safe deposit box in the room.The TV hasn`t any international channels or anything with music. THE FOOD : Breakfast included.Breakfast is between 7:30 and 10:00 AM.You eat breakfast in the atic on the 4th floor.You are surrounded on 3 sides by windows so you can see the surroundings.The maximum capacity is about 50 people.Everyday you get the SAME THING: TOAST,CEREAL,MILK,BUTTER,GEM,YOGURT,CROISSANT,CHEESE,APPLES,LITTLE CAKES,COFFEE,TEA,JUICE. THE STAFF: Are very friendly but only one lady from the concierge spoke English. CONCLUSION : In my opinion,for 30 Euro per night/person with Breakfast included this was pretty good.We didn`t have any problems,the staff was nice,overall the hotel was clean.I give it a THUMBS UP for it`s price range and for being close to Termini. Hope this helps you .", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cOk basically\u201d", "Author": "binklebonk", "ReviewID": "UR82474428", "Content": "3 stars so you wont get the best shower in the world but it does the job . Friendly and helpful desk person. I stayed in the cheapest single room. It was clean enough. Did have to remmeber to put shower curtain across door to avoid flooding room (you do this once no biggie). Breakfast up top on an enclosed terrace. Toast in a plastic packet was a first for me. The tram across the road will get you in to the main transport hub \"Termini\". It can be jammed with commuters so just wait for the next one if so. Make sure if you are going to Termini that you do punch your ticket in the machine on the tram. At Termini they often have security to check this. Tram from Termini stops some time before 11pm (as i found). Taxi at that time was expensive I think 22 euros! It's only a few kms you can walk. Tram is like 1 euro. Tickets are same as for bus. You can get from any news agent/tobacconist/kiosk. Google earth shows the tram line that you wont get any info off. Tram stop by hotel is called Villini. I think it's only 2 stops to Termini pretty close you could walk if you haven't had enough of that in Rome.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Antico Acquedotto", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d675175-Reviews-Hotel_Antico_Acquedotto-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$65 - $146*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via di Villa Serventi 9</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00176</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "675175", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/da/32/da32fa1d64198b155b60df21e16444517large.jpg"}}
