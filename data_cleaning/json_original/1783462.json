If you never been to Hong Kong you might been wondering where to crash..but it all depends on the reason of your trip. If you are on a shopping spree.. then i highly recommend this hotel because it is near to the 'Ladies Market ' which is a bazaar where you can find things and also a shopping mall just a few blocks away.. other than that.. there are also a few 7eleven nearby. Also the MRT station is situated on the lowest level of the shopping mall (forgot the name). If you want to go to Disneyland than you can take the MRT ride there. As for the room..its small but clean and the service is good. But who needs a big room if you planning to go here and there rite?

Location - Like the others had mentioned, hotel is located at red light district. Pretty safe for girls i would say (consider that you don't wear skimpy like them), as for guys, may not. Cos on my approached back to the hotel, saw a pimp tried to introduce girls to this man. But then again, they do not bug you even if you don't want. It's near to MTR and Ladies market. If you know where to shop, this hotel may be a great help. However, it's a little inconvenience to go to the airport with many bags. You may consider taking cab from them at a flat rate of 280HK dollars. Rooms - Not sound proof. You can hear others switching on and off the light. In the middle of my sleep. Actually heard moaning from the room beside us at about 2am. That's how bad the sound proof is! Everything you need, they have it there. So far so good. The bed is abit hard and the pillows were too soft for me to have a good night sleep.

The weaknesses: - Walls are paper thin, I can hear people switching their lights on and off and using the sink. - Crazy kid (abt 12 years old) running up and down the stairs and shouting in his room, kept me awake all night - Inconsiderate neighbors who did not close their room doors properly or leaving their doors open so that their relatives from next door can walk into their rooms without pressing the door bell....and the door security buzzer was beeping all morning and night, until we call for the staff downstairs to ask these inconsiderate people to shut their doors.

On one occasion when I went to the nearest 7-11 to buy stuff, 2 girls approached me and asked if I wanted to have a \"good time\".. really. The hotel staff are very VERY UNFRIENDLY and don't care about you, they just sit there in the reception area feeling like bosses. As for the value, contrary to what other people say, you could have cheaper hotels where you can check-in in SAFER locations. The rooms are small but are clean and nice because they are new. The hotel itself stands out as this is the only nice and relatively new in the area. Pics of the hotel are deceiving as they only show the rooms and the front of the hotel, and NOT the area around.

Some hotels even charged more than double their usual rates. Thus I looked for other hotels which did not increase their price. And I found Pop Hotel. The hotel provides simple but comfortable room, with free internet, (cable and wifi), daily bottled water, slippers, toothbrush, etc. However, the TV only shows Chinese Channels. While the water supply in the shower is good, the water heater is not consistent. Suddenly the water can turn very cold or very hot. I'm guessing that this is due to small water heater tank. The Hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Langham Place, MTR and shopping District. But it is located in the vicinity of hardware stores selling various metal products, thus I feel that the walk is much longer. The hotel will satisfy many travelers who wants to shop and do not expect a full hotel service. It does not have a restaurant. It is after all a budget hotel. But if you have small children or wants better service, this might not be for you. Restaurant Tip : There is a small Dimsum place popular with the locals, Tim Ho Wan, about 15 minutes walk from the hotel. The wait time is about 1 to 2 hours. But the food is excellent and the price, very reasonable.

Directly across Nathan Road is Ladies Market . . . which is about all I can appreciate about this hotel. Service is non-exsistence, not even a smile from the lady at the counter even though I greeted good morning first every morning. Pillow too flat I asked for an extra pillow, the guys at the counter did not get back to me. Finally on the last day the elderly uncle at the counter directed me to where to get cab to airport in a friendly manner. Was given 2 complimentary bottle of water on the first day only. As mentioned by one reviewer, the wall defnitely made of paper! In the afternoon I was unpacking while 'enjoying' a lively conversation between the housekeepers. At night my Thai tourist neighbours kept me awake in their conversation till 2am in the morning. Although in a red-light district as mentioned by some reviewers, I did not see any 'beautiful gals' standing around, so shopping till wee hours was not an issue for single gals like me.

This time, try Pop Hotel to save some money as I am traveling solo. POP Hotel SIZE - yes is not a big as others but we are only talking about missing the areas are that one place that we lay our luggage down & the bathtub. Hotels in HK don't offer big rooms anyways, and this is definitely bigger than some Business hotels that I have stayed in Japan for solo travellers (and paid less at Pop). Had a room with 1 bed (is like 2 twin put together king), clean, new, has all that one needs - safe, tv, coffee, dresser. everything is very decent, other than I have to stand my luggage up by the wall the entire stay (which is not a problem for me). Location - Great & Safe - get out of the hotel thru the \"automatic door\" then go to your left, walk straight 2 blocks (1 block is 1 min in HK) down \"soy street\" then turn left at either Shanghai st (that's the Langham mall down 2 blocks), or keep on soy for another 2 blocks till you see \"Nathan Road\" then turn left. those are the 2 most convenient MTRs stations with shopping along (i would say 5 min away from hotel). Others mentioned the brothels along, don't worry, no one bothers you on the street - they are just \"signs\" and no one \"stands on the street\" like in other countries. I have got back to the hotel as late as 2am, and there are still regular people on the street & mini bus station right outside of the hotel still in service (Mongkok is a busy place, many restaurants open 24 hours and shopping till midnight). Quietness - agree that walls are thin, just hope u don't get the room right next to the elevator -elevator is loud (my room was almost at the end of the hallway so all I heard was door closing from \"neighbors\" when they take off or in the middle of 1 night, my neighbor coughed in her sleep. so that tells you, the location itself is quiet, no road noise (had the AC on the whole time, windows shut, curtains closed - no view at all anyways). I had no trouble falling asleep and staying asleep but I can imagine light sleepers might suffer (but they usually wear ear plugs anyways =) ) Cleanliness - Clean & Brand New Hotel, modern decor - no complaints there. Value - paid $570HKD ($74 USD) each night (stayed 3 nights) in advance. Booked thru agent online , submit my request, the they confirmed availability and I paid.
