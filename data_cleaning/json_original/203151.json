Stayed at Bernini Bristol Hotel. Nice staff, speak English. Nice decor. Old elegance and tapestry. Comfortable clean rooms with robes provided. Nice,relaxing view from rooftop restaurant/bar. (indoor/outdoor). Some evenings there's a piano player. Located at (Square) -Piazza Barberini, where you can find a Bernini Fountain and sculpture. Hotel is closest to Trevi Fountains, within minutes to Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Wedding cake- Emmanuel Vittorio, Coliseum etc. Metro Barberini is in front of hotel and only three metro stops to St. Peters and Vatican area. Additional 10min walk to Vatican/Sistine Chapel or 45min continuous walk from hotel, winding through Rome. (St. Peter's Basilica -Remember to wear appropriate clothing, cover shoulders) Hotel has small gym, few cardio equip, limited free weights/bench. Somewhat functional universal machine. Spa. Hotel provides internet at reasonable prices or free Wi-Fi at Pepy's Bar across Piazza Barberini, in front of Bernini Sculptor. Friendly waiters, speak English. You can have good coffee, sandwich, salad, pasta, glass of wine and people watching. Hotel Bernini offers a nice continental breakfast buffet. Dinner- If you don't feel like being around a lot of noise and want great food at *reasonable prices, then from hotel, cross Piazza Barberini, direction of Bar Pepe, turn left, then immediately right, down a quiet alley. Almost at the end, on the left is a small family owned restaurant \"Da Olympia\". (Might be closed on Mon.) Delicious food, great pizza, pasta and *antipasti bar. Family speak very little English but nice to tourists. Re: Tipping. All restaurants charge a copperto (service charge) but 10-15% is customary for good service. Some places charge more (service charge) to sit outside. Another area nearby Rome main attractions with lots of good restaurants at reasonable prices is in \"Trastevere\". Reasonably expensive restaurant with nice view, quiet, indoor/outdoor, romantic, is the street at top of Spanish Steps, turn left, you'll find restaurant *Ciampini\". Best gelato is Giolitti ! Been around since early 1900. Close to Pantheon. Might see lines but please wait!! It's worth it ! Be creative, Mix any flavor. Yummy! I like to walk to the Trevi Fountain afterwards, sit relax while enjoying my \"Giolitti's\" gelato. Currency exchange- from hotel, turn right, behind metro entrance across street, next to corner restaurant. ATM machines outside hotel door to the left. Center Rome is approx 40min good traffic and up to 1.15hrs bad traffic from main Leonardo Da Vinci airport. Located on the metro Blue B- Line. There are buses avail. or by train approx 30min. to Main Metro - \"Termini\". Approx 10euros o/w. 0630-1130pm. Termini is 2 stops from Metro -Piazza Barberini, (Red Line A) where you can find Hotel Bernini. Many side trips possible. I enjoyed the quiet, historic, medieval town of \"Castel Gandolfo\". Pope's summer palace. Easy to get to and within 30 from Rome- Termini metro train. (Buy ticket at machine or newspaper/tobacco shop). Get off at last stop and walk to top, uphill. Overlooks the beautiful Lake Albano, nice sunsets, nice restaurants.

The A/C did not work well. The was very little water pressure and a hair dryer with little power, which was a problem for my wife, who could not wash or dry her hair.

Most of the time there was no doorman, or maybe the doorman was busy doing something else.We had previously stayed at the St. Regis, which is a TRUE 5 star hotel. There is no comparison. Of course the Bernini is much less expensive, and the old adage that you pay for what you get is true. This is not a bad hotel, it is just really a 3, maybe 4 star hotel if you're pushing it. I think it gets 5 stars because it has a Spa, Restaurant, 24 hour room service, and raters give a lot of points to these things.

I don't mind expensive hotels as long as they live up to the expectations but this was not the case. The staff were more or less helpful, depending on who you spoke to but overall I felt like many of them didn't really care. All of them smile politely but that's about it. The rooms and amenities look expensive but rather old. For example, there are occasional lightbulbs that are off, the air conditioning was making a funny noise unless it was set to a minimum, the extractor fan in my bathroom didn't work at all. The elevators are small and slow, you have to wait for ages for them to arrive. The internet access is just as expensive as the room is (something like 7 euros for the first 3 hours and 24 euros for further 24 hours) and it's horrible: you have to log in using prepaid cards you have to carry with you and the speed isn't that great, really. Every time you close the lid of your laptop, you have to log in again... and then log out, so that your credit didn't run out. Sometimes it just doesn't work. Given that I spent a lot of time online, it was a pain. The roof terrace offers really nice views, I must say (my colleagues and I spent a few evenings there) but the service doesn't live up to the expectations. On more than one occasion we were wandering around looking for somebody to take the order or to give us a bottle opener for the beer they served. The breakfast, even though there were all the things you would expect in a five star hotel, was really nothing special. When I pointed out to a member of staff that there's water dripping from the ceiling above the self-serving area, she nodded as if she knew and didn't care and left without saying anything.

Having said that, for Rome it probably is five stars. Nevertheless, the hotel building does look impressive both from the outside and its marble foyer inside. It also has a beautiful rooftop terrace restaurant and bar with wonderful views of the eternal city \u2013 probably one of its best features. Same parts of the hotel (carpets, wallpaper, etc) and some of the furniture looked a bit worse for wear but nothing really bad. The hotel lift is probably its worst feature and desperately needs replacing. The staff were all courteous and helpful. The hotel\u2019s position was not as central as I had hoped. Although very close to major sights such as Trevi Fountain (about 5 minutes\u2019 walk) and the Spanish Steps (7 minutes\u2019 walk), it was much further away from others such as the Colosseum, Campo dei Fiori, Piazza Navona, etc. The Metro station was right across the road from the hotel however because Rome has only two lines (A & B) you can\u2019t get to all the tourist sites using the Metro (75 minutes trip cost 1 Euro; 24 hr. ticket cost 4 Euro). Also they only run until 11 p.m. which is ludicrous given that Italians don\u2019t go out to dinner until 10 p.m. Metro tickets were also good on buses and these went everywhere. The only problem (but fun) being working out where this was. There is also a taxi stop outside the hotel and taxis were relatively cheap. It cost us 10 Euro to get from Colosseum to the Hotel. I booked a 3 night Dolce Vita weekend package directly through the hotel\u2019s website (after comparing prices through TripAdvisor) which included a Piazza Barberini view room, early check-in, late check-out and continental breakfast. However, on arrival at the hotel at 10 a.m. our room was not ready. We were told that the housekeeping staff were just about to clean the room and to come back in two hours. However, we had to wait until 1:30 p.m. before we were able to get into our room which was disappointing. However, we were able to extend our check-out by a further 2 hrs until 2 p.m. The continental breakfast was served in the hotel restaurant on the mezzanine floor (not rooftop restaurant which would have been so much better). It was your typical European fare - nothing outstanding. Our room itself was large with a king size bed and a beautiful Juliet balcony that overlooked the Piazza Barberini with views out to St. Peter\u2019s and the Vatican - a very romantic view indeed (see photo) and worth staying here for (I did request a high floor and got the 5th floor). There was also a large entry and sizeable marble bathroom. The bed was a bit on the firm side and the pillows a bit on the soft side \u2013 but I always travel with my own pillow so this didn\u2019t bother me. I was worried about the air conditioning given the reviews that I had read on TripAdvisor prior to booking , however we had absolutely no problems. In fact, the air conditioning was the best we had on our entire trip especially given that it was a blistering 39 degrees outside. At check-out we were surprised to learn that our package also included a transfer to the airport (which would have cost 40 Euro by Taxi as this is a set fare) and we ended up feeling like rock stars driving to the airport in the back of a new Mercedes sedan with blacked out windows and a driver wearing a suit and cap.

What I cannot understand is the management's less than forthcoming answers. A concierge told me that this was \"not the first time\" this sort of thing had happened. I wonder why, then they do not improve security, particularly when they asked us to put our bags in a unsecure location. Further, this is not a 5 star property, according to any standard with which I am acquainted. The area rugs in the commons area are stained and dirty; the entire building shows of a former glory, that badly needs updating. The most basic expectations are barely met; we were greeting with cold water showers many times, with the explanation, \"you must let the water run for 5-7 minutes for it to be hot.\" The beds are past their prime. The commodious commons areas on the room floors are dark, and the furniture in poor condition. In short, this WAS probably a 5 star property, but if that is your expectation, you would be better suited at another property. On the plus side, it is conveniently located, and the breakfasts were bountiful, although the wait staff was overwhelmed by the number of persons coming to breakfast, so service was spotty at best.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middle East", "Title": "\u201cGreat location & rooms but a bit run down!\u201d", "Author": "buddahMiddleEast", "ReviewID": "UR116027715", "Content": "We are a family of four ( 2 kids ages 14 & 11) and we stayed at the Bernini Bristol for 5 nights before going on a Mediterranean cruise.

Today it is not; nor the property nor the hospitality. Instead it appeared rather like a tourist trap. Possibly one would argue that the location and the roof terrace are worth the very high price level. However, you will get similar views and locations at many of the other hotels in this area. Also the view is not very special, just very nice. For example you don\u2019t see much on the horizon that you can recognize as a famous land mark. Instead you see some nice roof top gardens on the neighbouring houses and with some imagination the top of the Vatican. Further, the roof top restaurant is not very luxury; furniture and decorations are very average. I didn\u2019t stay for dinner. More important the old and ugly hotel interiors; carpet, lobby sofas, wallpapers from cloth, everything is very old and lost its elegance long time ago. Now it rather looks dusty and possibly dirty. I argue that probably the whole place is dusty, because it\u2019s very difficult to clean all this cloth. My room was as well a disappointment. It appeared very basic and sparse decorated. The carpet and my bed were clean. However the cloth cornice behind the bed was visibly full of dust. No one must have even tried to brush it of since at least over a year. Probably that gave my the feeling that the room was in general dusty. The bathroom was a disappointment too. The floor, toilet, and sink were clean, but both the roof and bathtub seals were covered with dark mold stains. Also the functionality was not very practical. For example the shower waterhose was very cheap and not possible to fixate in a comfortable position. Further the shower cover was too small. Therefore I managed to wet big parts of the bathroom floor. My bed was a dobuel bed put together into a big bed. Interestingly one on the two beds were broken. The spirals were dead and were clearly hard as well as made a klonk sound when I was moving. Luckely the other side was functioning normal. The breakfast was my next dissapointment. Just the look of the stainy old carpets, old wallpapers from cloth and old drapery made made me loose the apetite. Further the food selection reminded me more of a motel style continental breakfast. Certainly there was nothing luxury or 5 star here either. Just plain vanlia motel breakfast. Also the personell were busy or understaffed. Hence no warm welcoming, seating, or choise of coffe/te. Finally my tee was served by just banging the pot on the table. As a summary the staff were more busy chainging table cloth than offering 5 star hospitality. At least the reception staff was very profesionall, fast and hopsitality minded.

We had a deal including \"GUARANTEED upgrade\" ,welcome gift and buffet breakfast. Arriving at the hotel I was surprised that the receptionist-her name is Yanna- did not found right to rise her eyes from the computer (nobody else was there)and asked me on a very disturbed tone:\"checking in?\". No \"welcome\" and no \"hello\". Very soon she started with the check in procedure and was very unpleased with the way my husband filled up the form (missed the right line everything being very unclear). She threw the file to the garbage and said like a teacher to a lazy pupil \"now you have to fill an other one from the beginning\"-no try to help in any way. When I reminded her that we have a guaranteed upgrade she started to talk on a very un-appropriate tone with me and my husband. The essence of what she was saying is that we don't have a GUARANTEED upgrade and she is not going to give us a junior suite (which was next category). She did everything in order to make us give-up,continuing to say that we do not understand what is written on the reservation and that the upgrade is upon availability and that they are fully booked so they can't give us the junior suite. After the fact that we said we will contact immediately \"SummitHotels\"(they are part of this chain) and asked her for the manager ,she refused to call the manager saying that she will contact him by herself. She disappeared for 30 minutes from the reception and on her return she said with the tone as she makes us a great favor that she will give us the junior suite (*interesting they were not fully-booked anymore). And now about the hotel: very centrally located ,close to Spanish Steps and at the beginning of Via Veneto ,the Metro station is in front of the hotel. But ,the building is very old and needs renovation ,the furnitures are old ,faded,bathrooms with old installation including rust and yellow -brown spots in toilette. If you have a room on the 7-th floor -as we did-you are dead! The restaurant-terrace is on the 8-th floor right above your head and they remove the tables a few time per day including middle of the night-after they close the restaurant. So forget about sleeping ,the noise is so strong that even TV we couldn't hear! Breakfast is average ,at 5 star hotel I expected freshly prepared eggs -not re-heated as they serve. Also the sweets are really bad . No newspapers ,they make copies on a copy-machine of the principal news ,pathetic! The hall of the hotel is also very badly furnished,not like a Grand Hotel.

A room cost us more than double what we would normally pay, and we don't often use budget hotels. But we both agreed it was well worth the extra expense. It is very conveniently situated, close to the historic city and not far from the main rail station (Termini). There is a Metro stop a few paces away from the hotel entrance, and the piazza over which the hotel presides is a major taxi hub. All the major guided-tour buses stop in the piazza. There are loads of trattoria, restaurants and bars to suit all tastes, and good quality shops nearby. It's a five minute walk to the Spanish Steps, and about fifteen minutes walk to the river Tiber (Tevere). The hotel itself is rather grand in a slightly self-conscious and over-dressed way, with damask wall-hangings, heavy curtains and matching furniture. Our room faced the piazza so we had a good view over the square and its slightly grotesque Triton fountain. The room was soundproof and very quiet. It was also big, with a fine high ceiling. It felt comfortable and not at all claustrophobic like some hotel rooms. A rather off-putting point - the carpet was really dirty, it had been vacuumed but it was grubby-looking, and there was an indelible wine-stain in a conspicuous place. The bed was large and comfortable, linen good quality. The bathroom was a disappointment, an over-bath power-shower but an inadequate shower screen. A marble surround for the sink offered plenty of room for make-up to be stored. The push-button flush on the toilet came away from the wall when pressed. The bathroom door didn't lock - not essential, but could be inconvenient to some. In-room facilities included a minibar, a safe, and a TV with CNN, BBC News 24 and some SKY movies. No coffee-making facilities. We were given a complimentary bottle of red wine on the evening we arrived. Room service is good, but very, very expensive - not for the faint-hearted. We had a meal in the Olympus restaurant on the roof, and the service was very good, the food well-cooked, well-presented and tasty, but (again) very expensive. A bottle of local red wine cost Euro 50. But the total experience was worth paying for, as was the view from the roof terrace over the rooftops to the floodlit dome of St Peter's.

However, I was told to check back in an hour, that it would likely be ready, but after 2 hours it still wasn't so I decided to do more sightseeing and come back later. When I did come back, though, they had brought my luggage up with a bottle of wine, which was very nice. The room was very nice, and the toiletries were of really good quality. However, the most disappointing thing was actually the service I received. Outside of the wonderful bottle of wine, everything else was not very helpful. They do not exchange currency, which I find a bit odd for an international 5-star hotel, and as law in Italy, do not have irons in the room. While that is fine, when I called to ask, I was told that there was nothing they could do for me because the laundry service was over for that day and that I should find an outside laundry facility. When I explained that I couldn't get into my room until 4pm and my event was at 6pm and I needed to iron my clothes, I was told that that's the way it was, and if it was urgent they could \"try\" to get something done in that amount of time by an outside vendor. Given that I needed my suit, I just decided to try to steam it in the bathroom. I understand that laws are laws, but I can't believe I'm the only one who needs something ironed and is only staying for one night (thereby not able to use their laundry service). At another hotel in Milan, they had a similar law but housekeeping would iron items for guests. Also, they don't have a business center.

Piazza Barberini is so centrally located that you can really walk almost anywhere. We only took a cab once during the whole week.

There are literally dozens of restaurants and trattoria within a few minutes of the hotel on the Via Tritone or the Via Veneto, so whether you're looking for coffee and a croissant, a slice of pizza or a really nice dinner, you don't have to go far. The only negative thing I have to say is not about the hotel itself, but about the tour company that the concierge booked with when we asked for a Vatican tour and a day trip to Pompeii.

However there was no time to do this and, this is why we feel lucky, as otherwise we would have missed a nice experience in this pleasant, and very conveniently located, hotel. We stayed at the Bernini Bristol between September 30 and Oct. 4, in room 714 (on the left side of the hotel, which is, indeed, quieter). Our room was very nicely appointed and absolutely clean (after *much* looking, I found a *small* spot on one chair, and that was it!). After reading the reviews, we sort of expected to the hotel staff to be a bunch of very disagreeable people but, to our joy and relief, they were, without exception, absolutely charming, gracious and helpful and, yes, as soon as they saw us, each and every time they would offer a \"buon giorno\" or \"buona sera\" together with a smile. My wife really took advantage of the concierge services for all sorts of advice, directions, reservations and miscellaneous help, which they invariably provided very graciously (and I only tipped them at the end of our stay, so it cannot be said that we bought their kindness). This hotel's location is just GREAT! We were able to walk to and from most places we went to visit. This is definitely a plus. One criticism and some caveats: - The white wood panels in the elevators (by the way, they worked flawlessly during our stay) were slightly grimy. Hopefully, the hotel's management will read this and have them cleaned. - The voltage is 220v throughout, INCLUDING the outlet in the bathroom (at least in our room), no matter what they say. I almost fried my electric razor, but I was kind of expecting this and reacted quickly. So, bring your transformers/adapters (also for the round plugs that they use there) - As most European hotels, they provide no American-style washcloths, so, if you're used to them for shaving and/or showering, bring your own. - Limited TV offerings in English (not terribly important, as you are not there to watch TV anyway!) - Utter lack of wall hooks to hang things from (like your pajamas, or even the nice terry cloth robes that they provide) - The safe, indeed, takes eight digits instead of 4, and no instructions were provided. Things to the reviewer of September 25, I was able to figure this one out pretty quickly, though. - I was going to say \"limited closet space\" until we went to Venice, afterwards, and found the true meaning of the term.

I had read some less than stellar reviews on this site, so I thought I would speak up for the hotel. Its location is ideal for those who plan to travel throughout the city like my wife and I did. Steps away from the metro, internet cafe, walkable to churches, museums, restaurants - you name it. The breakfast is fantastic and was included in the hotel price, it was also a full \"American\" breakfast that even included champagne. The rooms, while not glamorous, were surprisingly large. The bathroom was very spacious as well. The construction that was going on to the facade did not in any way interfere with our stay. The roof top restaurant is pricey, but the staff are courteous and flexible. The food was good and the views were great. The exercise room is very small, but has good equipment. Fortunately, when I was using it no one else was so the lack of much equipment wasn't a big deal. I would recommend they add some more aerobic equipment. We plan to stay there again when we visit in 2 years.", "Date": "May 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arequipa, Peru", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Bernini\u201d", "Author": "TheSalvatierras", "ReviewID": "UR3416418", "Content": "My wife and I spent three nights of our honeymoon at the Bernini Bristol, and found nothing but the warmest service. The location is good if you want high-end shopping and the Spanish Steps, not as good if you prefer more quaint neighborhoods like Trastevere or Campo De Fiori. Extra bonus for Dan Brown fans - the hotel is right by one of the major locations in Angels and Demons, and not far from Santa Maria di Popolo. The hotel staff was very welcoming, and the decor is beautiful. The rooms are not luxurious, but are extremely comfortable. We prefer the neighborhoods further south, but if you want something near the Via Veneto and the Spanish Steps, you can't go wrong with Bernini Bristol.", "Date": "April 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, NY", "Title": "\u201cOur end to a lovely vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3332418", "Content": "My husband and I concluded our cruise trip in Rome November 1st,2004. This is the second time our cruise has ended in Rome and we were delighted to get our same room each time at the Bernini. It faced the Piazza and when you looked out late at night it was quiet and serene but during the day you had the hustle and bustle. The hotel is extremely clean and the staff is extremely helpful. They arranged each time for a car to be ready early in the AM to take us to the airport to make sure we were cleared for out trip back to the United States. The only thing I didn't care for was the mattress in our room the second time. I didn't remember it the first trip but it felt like a flat bed, no cushion to the mattress. I love the location it is so near everything that you can't get lost. We also found a cozy restaurant across from the hotel called Ciao Bella where we had a lovely meal in a cozy dining area.
