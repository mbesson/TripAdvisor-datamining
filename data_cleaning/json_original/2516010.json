This was by far the most expensive hotel we stayed in, but we figured it was worth it due to its excellent location in the heart of Hollywood. As other reviewers mention, it is close to all Hollywood has to offer, as well as being attached to a shopping mall and the Kodak theatre. Hotel has a multi-story parking lot right next to it so we were able to unload our baggage out front before one of us parked the car. Self-park is $10 for 24 hours, valet is $30 so we opted to do it ourselves. Check-in was smooth, lobby was very busy and we soon figured out that a convention was happening that day with lots of delegated milling about. This made all the public areas very crowded throughout our stay. Room was great and on the 11th floor, with a view of the Hollywood sign (although we didn't request it!) There is only a weighted Minibar in the room (which is VERY expensive) so we requested a fridge which was brought up within 10 mins. Bathroom was great, with Aveda luxury toiletries and plentiful hot water and towels. Only disappointment was the wi-fi as it cost $13. Over the previous week we'd stayed in 4 hotels along the coast - all were much cheaper than the Renaissance and all had free wi-fi! There really is no excuse for charging this amount for wi-fi, and it's always the big chains that do it. We did have a great nights sleep (no noise whatsoever) and the journey to Universal Studios the following morning was only 5 mins in the car so it's well placed for that.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Coast", "Title": "\u201cHoliday Inn Quality/Hyatt Pricing\u201d", "Author": "MickiD", "ReviewID": "UR129363850", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for one night because we had an event in Hollywood and the location is excellent. Although we were disappointed, it probably IS the best hotel of a bad lot in the area, but I would recommend that people visit the Hollywood sights and stay elsewhere. Our room, with taxes, was a bit over $400, which included the Club Floor amenity. From a value point of view, it was not close to being worth it. By way of example: -we pulled up in a taxi and absolutely nobody made eye contact or helped with our bags -we requested a quiet room and were assigned a room right next to the elevator, which meant that we heard the dinging of the bell and people talking all night long. -we asked to be on the Club Floor and were assured that we were. But we were on 20 and the Club Lounge was on 19. Not one person bothered to tell us, so we had to figure it out on our own. -the room was rather small and the bathroom was old and beaten up. Towels were stored in a nasty looking rack on the floor, the door was dinged up and the wallpaper was stained. -although the book in the room mentioned turn down service, we didn't get it -no shower cap in the room, let alone a robe or any other amenity befitting the high cost -the club floor breakfast was fine, but not worth the upcharge. The only benefit to being in this level was the assurance of a room on a high floor. Next time, I'd pay less and eat breakfast at one of the many neighborhood places -the staff was not warm and friendly....it had a real convention hotel feel. In fact, there was a large group while we were there, which was only a problem when trying to use the elevators during their transition. And speaking of elevators, room keys had to be used to access the higher floors and the location of the device was below knee level. It was hard to find the first time and irritating to bend down every time one was on the elevator. This is probably the best choice if one must stay in Hollywood, but I'd urge a different location. If using this property, I'd hunt for special offers to avoid feeling cheated the way we did.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAmazing location in the heart of Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "GottaRunandFly", "ReviewID": "UR129316944", "Content": "I've been to L.A. before but never had the opportunity to stay in the Hollywood area and the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel was wonderful.

My room (#1040 ) was at the end of a hallway which i thought would be nice because it would be quiet. I thought it was odd that i did not have a Do Not Disturb tag in my room but figured it was just an oversight, i generally ALWAYS put up the DND tag but figured i would the next day when the cleaning staff left one. WRONG!! I came back to my room to change and clothing had been stolen out of my luggage! and there still was no DND tag after housekeeping \"cleaned\" the room. it was more like they intentionally did not leave a DND tag because they wanted to clean the room so they could steal from their guests and no one would see because it was the last room at the end of the hall. When I brought it to the manager's attention, he pretended to be concerned about the situation and said he would look into it and take care of it right away. after many phone calls and phone tag, this was the final response i received... \"I just wanted to let you know that we looked into it and did not find your clothing in our lost and found and after speaking with the staff no one recalls seeing the item, sooo we don't have it\" Of course it's not in your lost and found!!

No matter how late or how tired you are when you check in to the hotel, after your interaction with Ms. Aricele, you will be certain that you will experience a very pleasant stay. In addition to Ms. Aricele being the best, all staff members are very polite and happy to assist and answer any questions you might have. At the concierge desk, I was able to obtain a wealth of information about restaurants popular destinations, in addition to the many facilities the hotel has to offer. The hotel itself is modern, very clean and it has all the amenities you would need without leaving the premises. Its location is perfect for every occasion. With all the amenities the hotel has to offer, in my opinion what really makes the difference and a memorable experience, is the extraordinary customer service skills received specifically by Ms. Aricele but all staff members are DELIGHTED TO ASSIST. For most travelers, the service you receive from the staff, being attendant to in a timely manner, the welcoming smile is the finishing touch and the icing on the cake. Thank you for making that a reality. Room Tip: The rooms in the higher floor allow you to view the beautiful architecture of the inside of the building, it is amazing.

Sure it is a bit crazy and lots of people, but in a strange way it represents Americana and the cinema world and as such it is an amusing place to visit....at least once! We arrived early on Sunday and were able to check into our room courtesy of a wonderful young man at the front desk Alex. He did something special for us when he found out we were on the Executive Level BUT near the elevators (which we really do not like). He said \"wait a few moments\" did some kind of magic and before we know it we are happily in a gorgeous suite with wrap around windows all sides, corner room, and HUGE! separate, kitchen, dining table, living room, etc., but all open and furnished in 1930's Movie Style. Really a very nice surprise and greatly appreciated. The food in the lounge for breakfast is wonderful and we stopped in for some tea early afternoon and they even had some food then for munchies, but the things for the 5-7:30 portion are not very nice at all. Potato Chips and peanuts and cheese with rasperry jam and Macaroni and Cheese! Odd really. Saw that they had a very nice honesty bar set up though. The Navigator (Concierge) here is very good, got us dinner/lunch reservations and suggestions in the Beverly Hills area easily and we found on our own a WONDERFUL place to hike to the top for the vista looking down on this city. It is Runyan Canyon and is less than l km behind the hotel and an easy walk. The only downside is that dogs are allowed to run leash free and if this is a problem, save your walking for other areas. We always seek out something in every area that is a bit of a challenge since we enjoy outdoor activity and walking alot. The hotel itself as others have pointed out is situated in the best location for being here. But it is quiet in the rooms. If you have never been here and have the need or desire to visit Hollywood, this is the place for sure. We have been treated very well at all times. Housekeeping is efficient and there is turn down in the PM.There is a small gym which could use a little improvement, several pieces of equipment were not working and the weights are outside by the pool. Speaking of that, there is a nice pool area with some cabanas.

Second complaint - our 'Hollywood Sign' view. We walked into the room to see part of the hill but most of a wall???? With graffiti all over it! However I will give the benefit of the doubt and say the year before was great, but they really need to listen to guests request especially returning guests and not pacify them without acting as this is a pricey hotel. They are however a great location, lots of nice cheap to expensive restaurants depending on where you want to go, brilliant that Graumanns Chinease Theatre is just steps away, along with Hollywood Museum, Madame Tussaurds and Disney's El Capitan Theatre.

This will be a long one but I want to share our entire experience. We are regulars in the Los Angeles area for work and pleasure. We usually stay in Santa Monica but opted to try out the Renaissance Hollywood as we would only be in town for one evening. We chose this hotel as I am a travel agent and a Marriott member and we had coupons to use that would give us a great rate. Essentially our rate was very low. We were in town for a quick little getaway and had spent the two nights prior at the Marriott courtyard in Monrovia using the same coupon rate. Just outside of Pasadena it was perfect for visiting the amazing Rosebowl Flea Market. We had no problems there, actually the staff and hotel were quite pleasant and comfortable! From the moment we checked into the Renaissance in Hollywood we were made very aware that we had a \"discounted room rate\", which from the lack of any greeting or smile from the front desk agent gave us the impression that you need to spend big $ to be treated well at this hotel. We checked in, and were handed our keys. We were not asked if we had stayed at this property before or made aware the location of the pool or hotel restaurants. When we checked into our room #307 it became immediately obvious we were given a room to match our rate. Our room overlooked the pool pump or some sort of roof covered in vents. The entire room was vibrating, including the lamps and glass on the bed side table. There was no way anyone could stay in this room. It was almost funny how ridiculously loud it was. I called down and politely explained the situation. I was told this was the only king room available in the entire hotel. I should point out that this was a Monday night. I did not believe him. I asked him if he could send someone up to check out the noise and he told me we were the only people to ever complain about this room. I asked him if there were no other rooms available because we were booked in at a travel agent discount rate and he then said there was one other room we could try. He sent up a bellman with our new keys. Our bellman Carlos came up. Carlos was gracious and polite and did admit he could hear the loud noise and explained that it would be his pleasure to help us get settled in a quieter room. We were assigned a new room on the floor that houses the conference rooms, pool, spa and crossover bridge/entrance to the mall. We were also assigned a room directly across from the elevators that were constantly dinging as they opened and closed over and over. At this point it was laughable. I should point out that we do not mind city noise, traffic, music, that is to be expected while in the city. We travel to New york and LA every few months and never mind street noise. However to pay for a room and have the noise be provided by the hotel itself is just silly. This time I called down and asked to speak to a manager. I was passed on to Alex (I believe that was his name) and he immediately rectified the situation by moving us to a quiet room on the 10th floor away from all the noise. The room was great, it was an upgrade, not what we were asking for but very nice none the less. We thought it would be smooth sailing from here on in. We were having trouble signing onto our free wifi that comes with our rate and is a bonus of being a Marriott member. I was embarrassed to be calling down again but I did and they said if I tried entering my name and room number again into the login page it should work fine. Of course it did not so I had to call down again at which time I was told that I was not eligible for free internet at this property. She then explained that If I thought it was part of my reservation I had better be able to prove it. Nice. Overall the hotel is lovely enough, sort of trying to be trendy and \"hollywood\" not completely our scene but still clean, comfortable and updated. The area is extremely touristy so be prepared. Also be prepared for attitude from the hotel staff. I wish I had better things to say about this hotel and our experience but unfortunately I will not be staying here again nor will I be booking any of my clients at this property.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "durie", "ReviewID": "UR122863322", "Content": "Visited here 2009, better late than never.

If you want to do the touristy stuff then it's in a fabulous location. It's right next to the Kodak Theatre and the Hollywood & Highland complex with heaps of shops and restaurants. Most of the tours depart half a block up from the hotel and the subway stop is right on the corner of Hollywood&Highland too so it's easy to get around (which was handy as I did not have a car). The hotel itself is huge, modern and clean. I got a room on the 18th floor with a view of the Hollywood sign and the hills. The room was a good size, very functional. The tv had plenty of free channels (I had read a review of someone saying there were no free channels on the tv which was completely incorrect). The bathroom was an Ok size, but the shower was over the bathtub. I had problems with the drainage in the bath/shower so that by the time I had finished washing my hair, the bath was half full with water as the drain was very slow - but it did eventually drain all out. The bed was very comfortable, but I had problems each morning with hearing noises from either the room above or the room next door - I couldn;t work out which. It sounded like someone walking in high heel shoes on tiles. This happened every morning around 6-6:30am and it went on for at least half an hour each time. This was annoying, although not really the fault of the hotel, although perhaps their walls are really thin. The check in & check out were very efficient and friendly, as were the \"navigators\" (concierge) who helped find supermarkets and laundries close by and even recommended a good bookshop within walking distance. The restaurant in the hotel (Twist) has reasonably priced breakfasts and they even let me substitute the bacon for fruit in my meal as I do not eat pig. Staff were very friendly. The room service was actually also reasonably priced too although the choices were not always that appealing. I also got a massage at the Spa (Spa Luce) that is part of the hotel. The cost seemed a little expensive - but I was on holiday so decided to go for it. It was enjoyable and relaxing and they try to make sure you are completely comfortable through the experience. The thing I loved the most about the hotel is the location though. There is so much to do close by, and if you want to travel a little further away, there is Hollywood Bowl, Universal Studios and Griffith Park all within about 10miles of the hotel. If you are more into Santa Monica or the beaches, then this hotel is probably not for you as it is a fair distance from them, but for my purposes it was fantastic and I loved the convenience of the location. The only \"gripe\" I have is that it costs $13 a day for internet. Yes I was a tourist, but I still want to have internet available to check up on things and to help with planning my days, so $13 a day was a bit steep considering many hotels now offer free internet.

I was not impressed by the room since there was a dirty patch on the carpet that seemed like it was not cleaned and there was some funky green stuff growing on the right sink handle.

I didn't really get to enjoy the pool because I was busy with the conference. LA is colder than I thought it would be this time of year with lows in the 40s. The pool was nice that it was heated but still too cold to enjoy since it was outside. The food at the conference was good- I loved their desserts and their cheese snacks. The sandwiches were not as impressive. I liked their chimes as they reminded participants to go back to the sessions. Temperature was comfortable at the conference. Overall, conference services were good. (except lack of internet) I had the bell man store my bags again because the conference did not end until 5 pm and check out is at 11 am. It took me 20 min to get the bellman to get my bags. A lady who worked at the hotel kept on telling me it would a few more minutes because they were busy. The two bellman mainly ignored me until I was able to flag one of them down and request he get my bag. The only one good thing was that there were free M&Ms near the bell station to calm my ire.

We were told before we went that LA was not that great, but we wanted to see it, and gave ourselves two nights, and two days here. We ended up staying in one of the nights, and left early on the 2nd day. West Hollywood/Sunset Bvld is really like a rubbish Leicester Square. Very touristy (as expected), but even within this, not much to see. LA seems very spread out, and I suspect you need to know where to go. Unlike other places we stayed, where there were lots of bars and restaurants in a small area, outside of the tacky tourist spots, there was no congregation of areas to go. I suspect a bit like London you need to know where to go. So onto the hotel. Not much really to write for me here. We have between us stayed in lots of Marriott hotels over the years, and actually redeemed points to stay here, rather than spend on another couple of nights accomodation. We considered 3 nights here, but so glad we decided to spend a night at Hermosa Beach (read other review). It was standard Marriott fare. Clean, large, and comfortable. Points I can add:- Check in lady was very polite, and helpful. Bell boys/car valet were very polite and helpful Concierge did not seem to know much more than a good bar/restaurant within the local area despite us being willing to travel further to find something we were looking for. Car parking was $10 a day, or over triple that for valet. Park the car yourself - is cheaper and not very difficult! There are three platforms to take a photo of the Hollywood sign from - in the outdoor part of the shopping complex. Marriott guests can go to the third floor, but are not allowed to stand on the walkway to take a photo, they are only allowed to access the Spa and Pool (which looked nice, but we did not use). No idea if this is Marriott or building management stopping you, but seemed a bit petty. A bottle of water from your room was $6.50 Nothing wrong with the hotel, it is Standard Marriott fare. It just felt too much like a business trip to me, and nothing special. If you were there on business in West Hollywood, and did not fancy doing much in the evening is worth a 4 rating. For a holiday/honeymoon - I would look for an alternative area in LA, and just visit here for a morning to do the tourist bits.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorba Linda, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for visiting Hollywood\u201d", "Author": "ChrisH3040", "ReviewID": "UR119301001", "Content": "This hotel is located at the Hollywood and Highland shopping center, in the same area as the Kodak theater (where Iris is currently playing) and Graumann's Chinese theater.

The location of the hotel is very good and easily accessible from the airport with a hire car. Our room was a deluxe room with a view of the Hollywood sign which was nice. Room was adequate with a very comfortable bed and good TV. We needed to use the 'complimentary business centre' whilst we were there to access the internet which we assumed from the literature in our room was free. However be warned when they say 'complimentary' it means your room key gets you access to the room, that is it. However the internet charges were reasonable so we spent around 5mins checking out some areas in LA online that we were going to visit. Upon logging off we were charged $199 for the session!!! We immediately reported this to reception who gave the attitude that they didn't really care and it wasn't there problem as the internet is provided by a third party and they have nothing to do with it. We spent the rest of our holiday spending some time each day trying to rectify this problem. Numerous visits to the hotel reception seemed pointless as no one seemed to care. In the end the whole problem was left for us to sort out and we both found the attitude and service from the hotel staff pretty disgusting for a top end hotel. We had stayed at three other hotels leading up to this one as part of our trip and couldn't fault any of them. In particular the service we received. I would never stay at this hotel again purely based on this experience. When you are on holiday/honeymoon something like this is disappointing and you don't expect it to happen.

My only caution might be expense: I paid about $350, including one night, late check out, and valet service. Normally I would seek cheaper options, but it's a nice splurge.

The hotel was very accommodating and again moved us - to the exact room i wanted - all moves happened within 15mins. We were very impressed.

Clean towels were provided daily. The only complaint we would have in regards to housekeeping is that the sheets were to be changed after the third night and they were not. We simply laid out the card on the bed to request a change of sheets the next day and they were changed then. In regards to the room itself, there was no \"do not disturb\" card in the room. We had to request one. Also, the door to the room was not inline with the jamb. So it was not possible to lock the deadbolt at night. Being from NYC, we like the idea of locking our doors at night. We used the latch instead. Also, our room was right outside the elevator bank and we never heard anything more than minor foot traffic from the hallway.

The hotel has a car but what a pain in the butt that process was, mainly because of the attitude of those people! I'm paying them and they act as if they can't be bothered to have my business.

The hotel offers a hotel shuttle, for a charge of course, to and from the airport. Parking is outrageously priced. The room and hotel were clean. There is a pool and workout room-both very small. The location is good for Hollywood attractions-all a short walk away. But to get to all the movie studios, rent a car because cabs are expensive.

As others have mentioned, many of these are within walking distance of the hotel or just a short drive away (Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, beaches, Warner Bros and Universal studios, etc). We also enjoyed the convenience of having a mall attached with restaurants, eateries and shopping, not to mention the Kodak Theatre. Not all rooms have great city views as ours faced a side street with a view of the hills and the Hollywood sign. However, our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The major room problem we had was with housekeeping. Being early risers, we were out of our room by 9am and usually returned by 1-2pm for a short rest. Both days this meant that housekeeping skipped our room. The first evening we were able to get it cleaned after 5pm by request. The second afternoon we left at 4pm and were assured by housekeeping, who were in the hallway, that they would get to the room before they left. Of course when we returned the room had not been cleaned. Needing towels to shower early the next day before we left, we called down to the desk to request towels that were never delivered. We noticed an unlocked housekeeping door next to the ice machine and took matters into our own hands and helped ourselves to the towels. Additionally, since the room had not been cleaned for two days we were out of Kleenex, low on toilet tissue and trash cans were overflowing. Not what I would expect for over $300/night. We enjoyed the pool during our stay as the weather was beautiful and the pool heated. The tile floor of the pool could use a good scrubbing but the rest of the area was clean. The cabanas available were a plus for the pool but the small pool deck resulted in a lack of enough lounge chairs for everyone and many people ended up having to use the regular chairs from tables in the eating area. There was a bar open but you had to serve yourself. It seemed a little odd to me that a hotel this nice wouldn't offer cocktail service around the pool. There is also a small menu to order food at the pool. We found this service to be slow and disorganized. Almost everyone who ordered didn't receive the correct food and by the time they brought out what was missing, you were done with the rest of your food.

My experience is the Marriott group's hotels have all been good (especially TEDA). As I have remarked in another review of another hotel; the circumstances surrounding ones arrival at a hotel has much to do with first impressions. In my case I was returning from Hawaii full of good feelings. My better half was thrilled to find that we could see the Hollywood sign from out room and was busy consulting the hotel information book for a stretched limo to take her and my daughter on the 'must do' tour of the homes of the stars. This she found at a great price. Me, this gave me time to explore. First I must avert to my arrival at Los Angeles Airport where I encountered a rude security officer who opted not to speak but rely on aggressive hand gestures to their hyper sensitive security screen alarming as in I entered. Efforts to get a response to my question in English only got more frantic wrist flapping. The Taxi ride was silent and as eventually emerged direct and not overcharging. Welcome to L.A ! So it came to the Renaissance to be welcoming. The reception is brightly decorated with colourful abstract paintings and looks inviting. We got text book functionality and competent assistance at the desk. The entreaty to 'have a nice day' though seemed to be used as a period, or full-stop as we might describe, to indicate an end to the transaction. On the positive side I must mention that it was 7.30 am and we got our room immediately. As I write I realise that I have never written a critical review of a hotel and this is not one either. It is reviewed in the context of matters surrounding that results in my disposition. So to the Hotel. The standard of this hotel was well in line with those of others in the group. The room was top class for a standard room. Breakfast was particularly good memorable for treats such as delightful fresh strawberries and other fresh fruit among the elaborate fayre. The hotel location is very central, particularly for my better half, as I referred, and to her celebrity curiosity. The complex that adjoins and incorporates the hotel includes a big Shopping Mall that included umpteen shops and eateries. Exit to Highway Bvd leads you to the street frontage of the Kodak Theatre and the famous Walk of Fame. My wife would be in her element I thought as I explored while she and daughter number two explored the Hollywood Hills. As I explored in the direction from Hotel through the Mall I met my next security officer, a female, who told me where I could not go. Why is it that the word 'Sir' is used in such a pejorative tone that suggest the opposite to deferential?. I ignored the interception. On exit to Highway I saw that preparation for an event at the Kodak was in progress. Standing on the side-walk surveying the activity I was approached by a black suited security type person who again told me where I could not be. Our 'conversation' about it being a public footpath and his absence of jurisdiction unless he could convince me that he was a police officer did stop him in his tracks. Speaking into the walkie talkie he was soon joined by an even bigger suited colleague with whom I had the same conversation. About this time my senses alerted me of remember things such as the Agency for Homeland Security exist, so I advised them that I was returning to my room in the Renaissance via the route I arrived. They said nothing. I choose to think they had difficulty understanding my Irish accent. Our pleasant evening meal in the Mall was in a restaurant whose name alludes me but it had a reciprocal arrangement with the hotel so that I could charge my meal should I choose. Clever marketing I thought. My stay as I said was en route from Hawaii to Ireland so this was a two day stop over to break the journey. Departing we asked the hotel to order a Taxi to the airport, which they willingly did. The Russian taxi driver was talkative that is until I pointed out that his meter was already registering higher than the first Taxi charge and we were nowhere near the airport. He fluffed about the meter only recently being calibrated bla bla bla and made a querying phone call to base or somewhere else. I took out my phone and asked for the number of the hotel so that I could discuss this matter with them. The meter was immediately turned off. We arrived at L.A airport to be assisted en route to our departure from the United States by two more abrupt and rude airport staff. Against this backdrop the Renaissance Hollywood became for me L.A's only shining light.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Aust", "Title": "\u201cExpected More\u201d", "Author": "TheWard", "ReviewID": "UR115068759", "Content": "It's a great location if you want to be in the thick of the tourist part of town and the amount of restaurants near by suited me.

It meant that we could come and go easily from the hotel if we had forgotten something or needed to rest in the afternoon.

There are the usual burgers/ dessert chains but also several less unhealthy options. Tip for vegetarians, most burger chains will have a vege burger option but failing that there are several pizza and Mexican places around that have good non-meat options of a decent quality and serving size! Or you can, as we also did , walk 10min to the Fresh and Easy supermarket to buy something. The in house restaurant Twist provides a good breakfast selection with lots of fresh fruit and omelettes made to order, plus there is a very good carrot/celery juice. There were small potted plants on each table as decorations which we actually real ! Gym facilities are very good. Several treadmills, cross trainers and bikes. There is free water and fresh Granny Smith apples. The weights are outside in a marquee overlooking the pool. Our room had plenty of space with a safe , writing desk and plenty of storage space. There are 5 separate mirrors (!). Bathroom has the bath/shower combo which , oddly,in this day and age of water conservation, only gave you the option of having the water on at full blast - or nothing at all.

You can get directly to the Highland via one of the hotel floors, which is great.

The gym is pretty small, but has a nice view and half a dozen cycle-type machines, which is far more than your average hotel. The weights are outside next to the pool, which is a bit of a bummer as it can be pretty cold outside (yes, even in LA).

The hotel room, I stayed in a double, is pretty standard, but had great, comfortable beds and a good work desk. There also was a couch and a small table, which brings a nice ambience and gives the room a bit more \"chilled\" athmospere.

While the hotel provides the usual body lotion, shampoo and conditioner, it doesnt provide body wash/shampoo which was a bit weird. There are bars of soap though.

We finally settled on the Renaissence Hotel. I managed to get a deal using my AAA membership, which was awesome. We arrived at the hotel and the lobby was full. Think there was an event for a fraternity going on in the hotel coz the lobby and pool area were really rowdy. At check-in, Frederick was awesome. He immediately upgraded us to a view room since that was the only set of adjoining rooms with double beds left. With my Marriott rewards membership, we weren't charged for the upgrade! Yay! I had also requested extra foam pillows and extra towels for the room. Frederick noticed that on the reservation and said that since we changed our rooms, he would need to send up those requested items after we get to the room. And true enough, those pillows and towels arrived in the room shortly after we got in. I was truly impressed. Our rooms were awesome and large. Great view of the Hollywood sign if you leaned close to the window. One of our rooms was the handicapped accessible room, which came with an extra large bathroom! Great when you have girls getting ready for a night out. Before going out, we decided to get some shopping done at the Hollywood and Highland Center which is right next to the hotel.

We were originally going to stay out near the airport, which he described as 'Depressing' and immediately saw he was correct. The location of this hotel is unreal. Its attached to the Hollywood/Highland Mall, as well as the Kodak Theatre, and Chinese Theatres.So you're just a stones throw from the heart of Hollywood. We were given a room on the 17th Floor, overlooking downtown LA, and the Hollywood sign. I like to think its b/c of my Silver Elite status, but it was probably just chance. The room was very modern, as clean as could be, and quite big. It boasted floor to ceiling windows, which was really neat and made for great views of downtown and Hollywood. Our first night, we simply just had a few drinks and enjoyed the view with the lights off. While I really have to reach to find someting to complain about, it would be the connection doors in our hotel room. They were paper thin, and you could hear the children next door almost like they were in our room. I also resent the fact that you have to pay $13/day for internet at a hotel that costs ~$200/night. Seems pretty stupid since I can go down the street to a crappy Days Inn or a McDonalds and get free wi/fi. We also visited the pool during our first night. The temperature was in the 50s that night, but the pool water was probably in the high-80s and was very comfortable. Its quite a pool, with a great view of Highland Ave, the hollywood hills, downtown LA, as well as the mall. The pool was very large, and could serve the casual wader, as well as a lap swimmer. There were plenty of lounge chairs for sunbathers (and you could get some great sun there!), and were also a handful of private cabanas as well. There is also a cafe that appeared to have served food and beverages, but was closed during our evening swim. Parking -- I would recommend pulling up to the front, unloading your luggage, and then moving the car yourself to the Hollywood/Highland Parking Deck, which is attached to the building. Its $10/day vs the $25/day valet. We were fools and made the mistake of just parking the car, and ended up carting the luggage through the very busy mall until we found our way-- not fun.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, Dorset", "Title": "\u201cBook it!

The location is central to everything LA. The property is located in the heart of Hollywood and the two blocks of tourist friendly vendors that it has to offer. The rooms are large and some have an excellent view. The neighborhood is very rough at night and not for the faint at heart and certainly not for young children. I would NOT consider this to be a family friendly location. Just a metro train station away, or a short drive (10 min) are the Universal Hilton and Sheraton, these properties are much more children friendly. Now for my humble opinion on the service level that guests will receive for their traveling dollars. I travel an average of 50 nights a year, and have stayed at this property a number of times. Each time I have stayed here I have encounter, lazy, unhappy and useless employees. I have been enticed back on several occassions by promisses of a perfect experience and a new attitude. However, each time I receive increasingly bad customer service and a management team that should be running a resort in Syberia. Resident Manager Sean Steenson is absolutely to blame or the poor quality of service at this property. Coupled with his partner Fredrick, this dynamic-duo of poor customer service dish-up absolutely the worst experience that this frequent traveler has ever received. I will always give a place a second, and in this case a number more chances, however, this time my duty is to you the consumer.

The hotel is in a great location for tours and sight seeing, and it is so close to the subway, buses and rental cars. There are restaurants and great shops in the complex too.

There were 6 of us, including 3 children, so we stayed in 2 rooms on an upper floor. The hotel itself is part of the Hollywood and Highland center which includes the Kodak Theater (site of academy awards), restaurants, shopping, and a Metrorail station. The center is also right across the street from Disney's El Capitain Theater. This location added a great deal to the enjoyment of our visit as there were major rainstorms during our stay and we were able to avoid using our car entirely during our stay. Universal Studios (and Universal Citywalk) is easily accessible and just one stop away on the Metrorail. Other Hollywood and downtown locations such as Union Station are also very easily accessible -- not at all typical for LA. We enjoyed dining at the California Pizza Kitchen that is in the Hollywood and Highland Center. While in the hotel, we had access to the \"executive club\" and found that the breakfast was great. It offered h'or d'oervres and desserts at different times week day evenings and the desserts were great. The staff in the morning was quiet, but friendly but the staff in the seemed to do his best to avoid any acknowledgement of the guests' presence (a simple \"good evening\" or \"welcome\" would go a long way). The hotel itself is very large, well run, and quite clean. The beds, though, particularly the \"king\" size bed, seemed smaller than standard and it was difficult to see how 2 adults could fit in the \"double\" in our other room. The The pool is beautiful, but it was raining and cold that week and there was no jacuzzi available. The Spa is prominently featured, but my mother-in-law was disappointed when she went there to investigate and was told that they had steam but also no jacuzzi. I was warned by Marriott reservations about the $29 daily valet parking charge, and, when we arrived, they were very clear about specifying that it would be $29 and we'd have to self park in the center lot to try to avoid this. I am not clear on how much that would be, but it wasn't that close and we were in the midst of a major rainstorm, so I was fine with paying the $29/day and considered myself fairly warned. Hollywood has come a long way in recent years, but there's still an underlying grittiness and seediness in the areas surrounding the major attractions. We tried using tripadvisor's recommended restaurants nearby and found ourselves in a place with reasonable pizza that was also attracting a local non-paying population that families with small children really don't want to be walking amidst.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEverything we expected and more!\u201d", "Author": "AnaRandyGallant", "ReviewID": "UR91969521", "Content": "We stayed one night, Dec, 1,2010, on our way back from our honeymoon in Fiji.

I am a lover of old Hollywood...the 30's, 40's....not much here to see/learn about unfortunately...they have not much left to salute those who made Hollywood...sad.... The hotel is attached to Kodak theatre...where the Academy Awards are held....and you literally walk outside a block and turn...and you are in the middle of it all....Walk of Fame, Hollywood Museum...(Max Factor Building)...which we toured...did have some old Hollywood pics and memorabilia...did the Tussand's Wax Museum...great time for a cheesey thing to do:) we walked into Musso and Frank's ....an original restaurant of old Hollywood still left...but the street here was getting seedy...and if was a bit stuffy inside...in terms of breathing I mean...had a hard time breathing...have asthma....the menu was not our cup of tea either...and pricing high...but seemed friendly...and cool to think the stars dined here... We decided to venture to the original Hotel where the Academy Awards were first held. The Roosevelt...which was actually recommended by someone here on trip advisor...it also has an amazing location. It is an old Hotel with lots of History.... older decor...very decadent...The restaurant (which was recommended by our tour guide) is known for its Hamburgers and wine. This was our second restaurant that had this idea on our trip to California....:)....so...we indulged.... The Sweet Potato fries were perfect...not soggy...and full of flavour...the hamburger was great...very big ...a bit too big to finish...but great....service was happy and friendly...we sat in read leather booths...the little restaurant was jam packed...decor...dark red walls and painted red tin ceiling...very cool...felt like I was transported back in time... We walked though the hotel...it is supposed to be haunted on the 9th floor we were told...and there was a Marilyn Munro mirror that hung here that was supposedly haunted...it is now in a museum...but....they do keep Marilyn's room...where she used to stay...we were very priviledged to see it....felt very strange once inside of it....very neat room...kind of eerie...but what a memory!!!!! We then went back to our hotel and walked through the lobby to the adjoin to see where the red carpet area is..(Academy awards) .there is a shopping mall here with plenty of take out restaurant choices ....seeing where the Academy Awards are held was very memorable... Back at our hotel at about 10pm....the concierge asked if we enjoyed our day....so friendly...:) the next morning we were flying home...as we are with Air Canada...and they offer no meals what so ever unless you pay $10 for a sandwich etc...we decided to order room service....It was prompt...and again the fellow was very friendly. The meal was very good...eggs perfectly cooked, as was the bacon ...the juice was lovely and coffee good...pricey...but good. We booked a shuttle to the airport here....save $$$ by not taking a cab.... down to the lobby...again...friendly....bigger lobby area...with a starbucks at the entrance.... I would say if you are staying for a short stay...this is your hotel...clean, updated, friendly....and at $189.00 per night....CAA rate...we think this is good value for the location.... Valet parking here is $29.00 Parts of the Hollywood area are quite seedy...and we did not feel comfortable by 9pm walking to the end of ....where the stars' plaques on the sidewalk were ( to read the names)...during the day...I felt fine.

I don't know, maybe it's just me, but for the prices, I was expecting something more than travel lodge level. We booked a non-smoking luxury suite and were given a beautiful huge room with a couch and sitting area that looked great and had a great view, but the minute we stepped in we could smell a strong cigarette smell. We immediately commented on it, but the bell man was quite courteous and asked us to give it a try and if we decided we didn't like it we could change whenever we wanted. He was so nice about it, and the room was so great, we decided to follow his recommendation. Problem was that we were staying for four days, and had quite a bit of luggage, so by the time we put everything away, and then got some dinner, it was close to midnight and decided to just get to bed. But it was too much. The smell permeated everything. It got to the point where it was uncomfortable to breathe, and kept us from sleeping. Finally at about two in the morning, we called and said we had to change rooms. They sent someone up to bring us to a new room and this time we asked to smell the room first. Well, sure enough, the new room was just as bad. So the bell man called down and got another room for us to look at, and when we walked into that room, we surprised four night employees who were sitting around the table smoking up a storm, and the room stunk to high heaven. Meanwhile, we're exhausted and have to get up at seven in the morning for a conference that we were attending, so we were getting quite frustrated. The bell man finally offered to take us to a lower level in a \"less expensive\" room where there might not be a smell. Sure enough, once we got to the cheaper / quite a bit smaller room, it smelled okay. Then we had to go through the process of packing EVERYTHING... (what a pain) and moving it to the new small room. The next morning, I realized that I had left a magnifying mirror in the old room and called the front desk to get it back, but they said they went and looked for it and it wasn't there. Because no one new had checked into that room yet, the only thing I can imagine happening to the mirror between two o'clock at night and eight o'clock the next morning is that the workers who were smoking in the rooms, went to our room to smoke, found the mirror and kept it... (or else they told me they had looked, but didn't). I had asked if I could go up and look myself because I remembered right where it was -- and they refused to let me... We ended up staying packed in like rats in that small room for four days. It would have been additional grief and taken away from our conference time to try looking for another room and then packing up and moving again. And we were just disgusted. Needless to say, we were really disappointed, (more like mad) about the whole thing and the complete lack of apology on the hotel's part. They wouldn't even refund us the night, but did give us a discount for that one night only. What a joke... I would have preferred an honest apology , explanation and promise to correct the problem with the smell and the errant employee problem... but nothing... Quite honestly, it seems like there is no integrity in the management of this establishment. They seem to be riding on the location, but that didn't help us as the conference we were attending was full time and we never left the hotel! I guess the owners feel like they can let it be managed at the travel lodge level because of where the property is. But seriously, I've stayed in travel lodges that are kept cleaner/smelling better. If there was one near the conference -- that would have been much preferable to what we experienced!!", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Banff National Park, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRenaisance Hollywood-great service and location\u201d", "Author": "canada123_10", "ReviewID": "UR82985628", "Content": "Great hotel-all staff were friendly and helpful-the conseirge were awesome and friendly and very helpful with direction- close to the wlak of fame, lots of great resturants and attractions.

We had booked our room from the day before, so we had a guaranteed room once we arrived rather than hoping for a very early check in. We were given a room on the 18th floor which had a magnificent view of the Hollywood Hills including the iconic Hollywood sign, such a great view. We paid $29 more (total not each) per day from the best room rate I could get from the hotel which then included a full hot buffet breakfast for us all. This was great value and the food was fantastic ( in Twist restaurant) with a hot & cold buffet selection plus a chef on hand to cook eggs of your choice, omelets, pancakes , waffles etc. $10per head for full breakfast in convenience of hotel was a great deal. The room was very nice, wouldn't say overly large but larger than standard hotel room. We got a room with two double beds. There was a HD screen in the room with a plethora of channels. Only issue we had was with ABC where the signal would break up all the time making it unwatchable. We told them but it didn't improve. We had requested with our booking a refrigerator but they said one was not available. When we told them why we needed it ( as we had medical supplied that needed to be stored in one) they got us one straight away. The bathroom was clean and well appointed. Houskeeping was perfectly fine as was room service which we had a couple of times. All the hotel staff, most especially the staff in Twist Restaurant, were fantastic. The door and bell staff were always friendly and always welcomed or sent you off on your way with a greeting/short conversation and a smile. Wireless internet was $12.95 per day which is a little overpriced, but standard for Marriott. It also included unlimited local calls. They did say they had free wireless in the public areas but I never used it. There is Starbucks in the foyer of the hotel also if you like Starbucks coffee One of the greatest thing about this hotel is the location. It is on Highland Ave which is one street back from Hollywood Boulevard . This is where the main Hollywood Walk of Fame is, Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre, The Kodak Theatre, Madam Tusauds, El Captaine Theatre. So you are literally in the middle of the main tourist area of Hollywood. The Highland shopping centre/Mall is connected to the hotel so this adds allot of convenience for shopping and meals.

This was definitely the best place to stay as there was so much going on. The best thing about it is the location - I could not believe how near to the walk of fame and Kodak and Chinese Theatre we were! Also seeing the sign from the hotel was brilliant.

Liked the make up mirror and complimentary Aveda toiletries in the bathroom and the Starbucks coffee and coffee maker. We had a view of the H&H complex which was very private. Housekeeping good and we had clean towels and more coffee every day. Great to have free air con and safety deposit box. All the staff we dealt with in the hotel were lovely, the concierge was especially helpful. We went to the jazz brunch on the Sunday in Twist Restaurant, what a treat! All the (delicious) food you could want and unlimited mimosas (bucks fizz!). Our server was lovely, the music was fantastic and it really was the perfect start to any day. We also had a couple of drinks and coffees in the bar downstairs, enjoyed the free nibbles with the cocktails and beers. One night they had a Frank Sinatra tribute singer who was great. The pool is really nice, however when we went up there were only 2 free beds (in the shade) which we grabbed for half an hour or so just to chill out. The others (prime spots in the sun) were all covered in towels and no-one to be seen. Grrr. Whilst in LA (only for 3 days) we went on the hop on hop off bus tour on one of the days which was very good. We stopped off at Beverly Hills and Venice and Santa Monica beaches, fantastic. We spent the rest of our time in Hollywood, we loved it. On the Sunday there was a movie premiere of Legend of the Guardians and the place was buzzing, it was really exciting. We had lots of lovely food but in particular loved the Hard Rock Cafe which was on our doorstep. We ate there twice and had lots of drinks in there too (both top notch).

We arrived a few hours prior to the typical check in time, so when we asked to check in early, we were told we would have to wait an hour or two for our room to be ready. We waited for about an hour, and then asked again if the room was available, and they told us they would upgrade us to the \"concierge\" floor. We soon found out that when they said upgrade they literally meant we were \"UPgraded\" - we were given a room on the 20th floor (top floor)!! Though I am afraid of heights, I got used to my ears popping on the elevator ride up to the room. Our rooms view was breathtaking!! You could see the Hollywood sign out the far left of the room window, and you could see downtown Los Angeles on the right side. The room was clean, fresh, and also had modern furnishings. We had the two double beds, a flat screen television, desk, ipod dock/ player/ radio and a modern looking chair (which in my opinion was VERY comfortable, and perfect for relaxing in while enjoying the beautiful view of Hollywood). The first night, everyone had some trouble sleeping; the beds were a bit uncomfortable (maybe a little too soft?). My sister ( a VERY light sleeper) also was woken up in the middle of the night when the A/C in the room turned on and off (the next night my dad figured how to keep the A/C running constantly.) Tip: make sure to have the fan or A/C on constant, otherwise you will hear sirens all night, even from the 20th floor. Unfortunately, our room was right underneath the red, lit up \"Renaissance Hollywood Hotel and Spa\" sign, so the first night the light was bright in the room, but by the second night we had gotten the curtain situated to block out most of the light from the sign. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. I really enjoyed the shower, shampoos, soaps, and lotion from the hotel's spa. And the toilet with different flushing types :). We went to the complimentary navigation desk multiple times to help enhance our 3 day stay in Hollywood, and each time the staff graciously helped us find restaurants to eat at, helped us figure out which attractions we wanted to visit, and even booked our bus tour of Hollywood. The pool was nice; it was medium sized, had a nice view (it was outside on the third floor overlooking the Hollywood and Highland Mall), and was complete with cabanas. On Friday nights, they had movies playing on a large screen by the pool. On our last day, we had a red eye flight home, and the Renaissance hotel had a place for us to safely store our luggage while we spent the day exploring more of Hollywood. They then helped us take our luggage out to the taxi they called for us (but the taxi ride was not complimentary, we had to pay) to take us to the LAX airport. The hotel also had a spa, business center (faxing and such), fitness center, and restaurant; but we never got around to using them. The wifi internet here is not free, sadly.

The original plan was to spend 2 of them here but after spending the first night here, I canceled the 2nd night and went elsewhere....and this is why... The service at this hotel is bad! Some of the worse I've ever seen! When arriving at the property for the first time, the first person I met that parked my car was decent, but it went downhill from there. Check in was on the slow side and when I asked questions she was quite rude with her responses. The room was clean, not too small and had a nice view, but for what I paid I did expect more. The biggest problem however was the fact that I paid extra for a package that included sparking wine and strawberries upon check-in and after a quick search of the room....neither of them were present. Made the first call to the desk and was told rudely that the staff that was responsible for them didn't operate till 5pm...what the......?? And I was supposed to know this how? 5:30pm...still nothing. I make the 2nd call, this time I'm told that they will be someone up right away to deliver them. At least this person had a nicer attitude about it, but still was not impressed. Finally got tired of waiting and went out at 6:30, talked to someone downstairs and once again, they told me they would take care of it. Got back at 9pm and you guessed it, still nothing to be found! This time however there was a voice mail left saying that I would be getting them shortly...this msg was left at 7:30... A 4th call made at 9pm got me the response that there were sending up someone right now with them......and at 10pm I finally got them. Didn't even have the nerve at this point to argue and question the delivery guy, he probably had nothing to do with this anyways. Also just in case anyone is wondering, the wine and the strawberries were actually good. Aside from this, the valet parking was decent....not once were they accurate with there timings but I never waited more than 15 mins so I'll overlook it The one good thing I can say about this place was the breakfast. Had the breakfast buffet and all of the food was excellent, everything was fresh, tasty and the made to order omelets were excellent. The guy working at the bar was the only friendly employee I met on the whole property. This place aint cheap neither, so my expectations were pretty high and boy was I ever disappointed. At the end of the day it did provide a place to sleep and the location was good but it didn't do much else, the next night I just decided to stay at a best western, it was 1/3 of the price and had far better service.

We checked in for a friday/saturday nite stay so that we could attend a show at the Hollywood Bowl. Let me list the service slights. 1) Pulled our car into the hotel, gave it to the valet. A bellman rolled our luggage from the door of the hotel to the front desk, and advised us that someone else would be taking it up to the room after we checked in. And then he stood and waited..... for a tip. 2) Another bellman took our luggage upstairs, sat it inside the door. No offer to get ice, directions. Didn't even turn on the AC. 3) When we checked in we valet parked at $29 per day. We called for our car 1,2,3 times. No answer. We decided to walk to dinner. 4) After returning to the hotel after dinner, we called housekeeping to get a set of sheets for the sofa bed for our 8 yr old. 3 calls before someone actually picked up the phone. Then after we requested the sheets, 1 hour later, no sheets. We called again, and the sheets arrived 45 mins later. By that time our child was fast asleep. 5) Saturday at the pool, one single waiter for the entire pool. I placed an order for a sandwich - a variation of a BLT, except it was a Salmon, Bacon, Tomato Avocado. I asked for no bacon. 1 hour and 30 minutes later it arrived ..... but it had bacon. The waiter took it back and said he would bring a new one. 1 hour later, still no sandwich. The kitchen refused to make another one. Really? Is that supposed to happen? I spent the entire afternoon starving at the pool. 6) Valet parking, NO ONE PICKS UP THE PHONE. For $29 per day, someone absolutely has to pick up the phone.

The teenagers ended up with a room on the 20th (top) floor and we were given a studio suite on the 7th. The kids had a standard room, a bit small, but it had a great view. Could see the Hollywood sign, Griffith Observatory, Capitol Records Building, and all the way to downtown. Complaints: When we got to our room, we quickly discovered there were no bath towels and no blanket for the pull out sofa bed. A call to housekeeping brought a quick response. There was also only one bar of soap in the bathroom. The next day I happened to look up at the air filter for the room's air conditioner. To say it was filthy would be an understatement. This was also quicly remedied. Other than those items, it was a very nice hotel. The staff was very nice and helpful. We valet parked our rental car, and the valets were very quick in pulling it around and almost always offered to get us bottles of water and asked if we needed driving directions. There is a pool located on the 5th floor. The area around the pool is not very large, so lounge chairs go quickly on sunny days. There are also a few cabanas with a couple of chairs and a couch. There is an outside bar, and the bartender was extremely nice and knew how to pour a drink. There is a decent view from the pool area. The room we had was large, and although it is called a studio suite, it was just one large, L shaped room. It had 2 flat screen TVs, although I can't imagine being able to watch 2 different channels at the same time, as they were so close to each other. The room had a pull out sofa and our 13 year old slept on it every night without complaint. There was a very comfortable king sized bed. There were a couple of large 1960's retro chairs, a table with 4 chairs and a number of short, red chairs/ottomans scattered around the room. The hotel is connected to the Hollywood and Highland Center, which has several shops and restaurants, the Kodak Theater and Graumann's Chinese Theater. It's right in the heart of the action in Hollywood. It was also easy for us to get to various destinations throught the city from there. Right across the street is the El Capitan Theater. It is owned by Disney, and Toy Story 3 was showing there during our stay. It is a wonderfully restored movie palace, and they have an organist playing on-stage before the film starts. I highly recommend it, although the ticket prices were much higher than you'll pay to see it on your multi-screen theater back home.

The room was very dark in the evening, the hotel needs to invest in more lighting.The pool deck is pleasant and the water is heated, great after a long flight.

If you have a car I wouldn't bother with this tour, you can do it yourself. I also went on the hop on hop off bus tour. I wouldn't recommend this either, I'd take public transport. This service only runs every half hour to 45 min depending when you go and we got stuck in Santa Monica due to a timetable error and had to catch the local bus back to the hotel, which was easy. Madame Toussaud's is also located just around the block from the hotel. I got a free ticket with one of the tours.

So we purchased water externally but it's the little things like this that can make a stay unpleasant. As the jetlagged kicked in our heads hit the pillows like bowling balls, so imagine our distress at hearing some sort of machinery??!! We couldn't pin point whether it was coming from above us or perhaps beside us, but the noise was ridiculous!! It wasn't overly loud just incredibly tortuous, like a slow water drip on your head. It would crank up every few minutes and last 10-15 secs, between midnight and 6am was especially busy. I'm convinced it was some sort of conveyor belt or dumb waiter for room service. I complained to Reception but they assured me there was no machinery near us. And they were heavily booked so they couldn't move us. This really put a downer on our stay.

It is not my favorite hotel in LA but it it close to work. The hotel is clean and the service is typical at what you would expect at any Marriott or Renaissance property. My only complaint and this is a big one is the location. The area surrounding the hotel is overrun with tourists and homeless. It is kind of like staying in Times Square before the improvements. The hotel is also attached to a mall which makes parking an extreme problem; hotel guests can either valet park at $29 a day or they are forced to park at $10 a day in the underground parking garage that is shared by the mall. Although the self park may seem like a good value, be warned that you will have to park maybe 3-4 levels down to find a parking space, take the parking garage/mall elevators to the 3rd level in the mall, and then walk to the hotel through the mall. This process can take up to 20-30 minutes depending on what is going on at the Kodak or Chinese Theatres. This can be a real chore when you have luggage. Also, if you arrive at the hotel (before your initial check in) after 10:00pm, the doors to the hotel from the mall can only be accessed with a card key. If you haven't checked in yet, you will have to walk down to Hollywood Blvd and then up Highland to get to the front entrance of the hotel. During my last stay, I valeted the car for the first and only night that I had a car. The valet charged me for 5 nights of valet when I checked out.

This time we chose the Renaissance and it was a great experience as usual. The common areas/lobby/bar are nicely decorated, elegant without being stuffy; check-in was welcoming and friendly. There are two bars: one in the lobby, which closes at different times depending on what guest activity is like, and one upstairs in the restaurant, Twist. We love the lobby bar as it's very comfortable. Be aware that drink prices are high by many people's standards, not unusual in Hollywood, but it's easy to run up a $100 check on appetizers and cocktails for two. The rooms are very clean; the decor is that almost-generic sleek modern style that isn't remarkable but works fine while you're there. A room with a view of the Hollywood Hills is well worth the upgrade charge, especially if you can get a higher floor. The concierge lounge isn't open on the weekends so it may or may not be worth the upgrade charge there; when it's open, it's got a fantastic view of the Magic Castle, and the continental breakfast is a nice selection, nothing too fancy but good pastries and bagels and lots of coffee. Food service tends to be quick, efficient and tasty, again priced a little high but at least you get some nice giant prawns on your $17 prawn appetizer. Breakfast at Twist is usually a good experience; we had less than attentive service on our last visit but nobody's 100% I suppose. My only \"caution\" with this hotel is that it attracts a LOT of partiers. Weddings, bachelorette parties, conventions, guys' weekends, you name it. We had an early flight and left at 6:30AM, right when a cab full of clubbers was coming home to sleep. The common areas do get a lot of traffic late at night; don't be surprised if the elevators are full and slow at 3 in the morning. The guests sometimes get a little rowdy--- I've had to call hotel security on two different trips to ask them to quiet down the neighbors--- security handled these requests gracefully and promptly. Considering I've stayed there about 8 times, this isn't a good average but at least they take care of the problems quickly.

I went down and complained and the first guy I spoke to behind the counter told me rather rudely that no one else had complained (no one else was in the room next to them!). The second guy (at the Bellman desk) was fantastic and after I explained that I didn't want any action to be taken except for a room move he was very reasonable.

My one complaint is that we had to pay $30 dollars a day for valet parking and tip the guys every time we took the car out and brought it back. It certainly adds up! However, the parking attendants were such nice guys that we it did not change our feelings about being at this wonderful hotel.

For one the air-conditioning is thru a wall vent that runs up the middle of building not ducted ceiling a/c which made the room a/c rather noisy.

The location is great if you want to explore Hollywood. The hotel is literally half a block off Hollywood Boulevard. Everything you could ever need is within walking distance. The place was mostly spotless, and I certainly have no complaints in regards to cleanliness. Where I can complain is in the service department. While folks were nice enough, the competence level was lacking. The hotel could not find my reservation (which was made over a month in advance) and did not want to give me the government rate for which the room was reserved. They wanted to charge me the full $299 rate for the same room. The guy working the desk seemed to have difficulty understanding that I didn't think I should have to pay full price since I was there for a conference being held in the very same hotel, and I had reserved well in advance at the lower rate. Eventually the matter was resolved, after I had already been charged for the full price, and the difference was refunded to my credit card. When I got to my assigned room, I could not believe they actually charged $300 a night for THAT. The room was little more than a standard hotel room, with a bed, a desk, a television and a bathroom. I have had one bedroom suites, with full amenities included, for one third of the $300 nightly rate for this room. Granted, they were not in Hollywood, but is Hollywood really an excuse for such exorbitant rates? The view from my room was also horrid. The window looks out onto the roof, and all of the air conditioning equipment for the third floor. My view was of the hotel wall and a roof access door, with several soggy cardboard boxes strewn about. Someone obviously didn't consider that the area could be seen from the room windows. Also, the flea-bag motel next door had me concerned that I might be witness to a crime if I watched long enough. The fact that the hotel charges $13 a day for high speed internet access, which most hotels I have stayed in provide for free these days, was just an added insult.

The windows are pretty well soundproofed, so the 24 hour traffic isn\u2019t an issue. Rooms on the north side of the hotel enjoy a great view of the Hollywood sign. The rooms are quite sizeable and well appointed with flat screen TVs with a very handy gizmo that allows you to easily play portable DVDs/laptops/MP3, through it, if you can\u2019t find anything better to do with yourself, in Hollywood. So, why so few stars? Well, the room that I was in had connecting doors, which afforded absolutely no sound insulation. Now I hate these. If you are staying with family members, and they\u2019re in the next room you can get hold of them fairly easily, via the corridor. Connecting doors aren\u2019t used by 99% of guests, but mean that you can hear what next door are ordering from room service. Sadly, my next door neighbours were highly excitable (and loud) fratboys and some hired \u201cfriends\u201d on an LA weekend, which made life a bit of a misery. My other half put in a call to security and they showed up pretty quickly and asked our neighbours to move the part-ay out. Sadly, and possibly predictably, this made them worse and they started trying to knock the connecting door in. By now it\u2019s about 3:30am. I went down to reception and they put us into another room, we just left our stuff in our old room \u2013 planning to return and pack (we were flying back to the UK the next morning).

When we got back to our original room our friendly neighbours were still bellowing banal rubbish at one another. Not a massive issue as we were packing up and leaving, but I would question whether they really know how to run a hotel. I always think you can tell a lot about a hotel by taking a look at the lobby in the middle of the night. In this place there were parties of squealing girls running around with bottles. In the lobby itself there were a few guys crashed out on the sofas.

For the Renaissance, we combined two different packages for two separate days. Our first impression upon arrival was a little mixed. When we walked into the lobby, there was a band in the lounge area playing exceptionally amplified music to an adoring crowd. But the concierge (or \"customer wrangler\"?) was there to guide us to the front desk, where both the desk person and I had to pretty much shout in order to talk over the loud band. Most likely your arrival won't be nearly as loud, though. One of our package deals included room service \"pizza, two soft drinks\" (10\" turned out to be just the right size for two people to share), an in-room movie and breakfast. The other packaged included a 50 minute spa treatment (upgrading to an 80 minute massage would've only cost another $40 or so) and lunch. Both deals included valet parking, which was quite a relief not having to worry about hunting for parking or paying extra fees for stashing the car in self parking. The front desk provided me with a discount card (typical discount was 10%) for a number of the eateries and shops in the mall between the hotel and the Kodak theater. Right now, new reservations at Renaissance also come with a $50 discount off any Spa Treatment\u2026. which my girl ended up using on a pedicure she was happy with. In the room, there was no minibar, no room fridge and no room safe (which I would have loved to have had, since I like to lock up un-needed credit cards from my wallet or my computer or passports or whatever). Closet holds an iron and ironing board and also plastic laundry bags. There's a complimentary overnight shoe shine service but the first night I called for the bell guy to pick up my shoes and he never dropped by. They did a fabulous job on my shoes the second night, tho! Room had a flat screen TV and an interesting box next to the TV where one can plug in various cables (like a stereo connector cable from an iPod, a VGA import port from your laptop), presumably so you can stream music or movies into the flat screen TV. In room movies were included in one package, but the audio / video quality of this in demand service were remarkably terrible for the big screen TV (the first screen you'll see of any movie is \"This movie has been edited for size\" screen; big screen TV's don't matter much when the resolution being displayed is bad). Twist restaurant is open only for breakfast and not for lunch or dinner. Sandwiches and salads are catered by Wolfgang Puck's kitchen and are available at lunchtime by the pool. Don't worry about dinner options within the hotel. If you're not up for doing room service, just walk next door to the mall and there are a number of semi-formal and informal places to dine. The fitness center (next to the Spa, just indoors from the 4th floor outdoor pool) has a very nice collection of equipment. One neat little feature is that you can plug your iPod into a number of the exercise machines and watch full screen movies or stream music from your iPod through the machine. Internet is available via either WiFi or Ethernet cables within the room but once you buy it, you'll be set for 24 hours and it'll also enables unlimited domestic Long Distance on the phone so you can keep in touch with family/friends via a cordless landline instead of relying on your cell provider.

The pool is fantastic, super views, but many locals try to crash the party, and security has to clear them out. I did not find the hotel's restaurant worthwhile for the exorbitant price with so many alternatives at the mall nearby. You need a car in LA, without a doubt, and the self park for $10 was really a bargain. San Francisco parking is three or four times the price easily. My only complaint--we were promised a room overlooking the Hollywood sign, and that promise was never delivered, but our view of the El Capitan theatre with its nightly premieres was probably better anyway.

I have found through my experiences that you can't go wrong with the Marriott brand. They certainly don't fall into the low-budget category and they are probably far from the top tier hotels. However, I find when staying at a Marriott, wherever it may be located, I get room and service that feels very close to what I would expect from the best hotels. This is the second time I have stayed at the Renaissance Hollywood in the past two years. The first time was for a press function held by the studios. I enjoyed staying at the hotel so much that I was quick to book it again for my recent business trip. I booked two rooms this time out, one for myself and my colleague. In advance of the reservation I made some special requests through the \"Virtual Concierge\" function on their website. I asked for a rooms on upper floors and for a view of the Hollywood sign. Upon arrival I didn't even reach the front desk before I had keys to both rooms in my hand. I was approached by the Concierge who had a list in his hand, asked my name, and then handed me my room keys. It was the most incredible check-in I had ever experienced. To top it off, I got the rooms in the location that I wanted. The rooms themselves are very spacious, well designed, and quite comfortable. I was pleased to find that there was a cordless phone in the room along with a port to plug in my laptop or a video camera so you could watch it on their flat screen TV. Very nice clock radio in the room along with a coffee maker for which I easily made myself two cups of coffee from every morning. The bed was to die for -- so entirely comfortable that one just sinks into it and falls immediately asleep. One of the most comfortable beds I have been in next to those at the MGM GRAND in Las Vegas. Some nice added touches in the lobby including ice cold water that has been flavored with fresh fruit soaking within and a huge M&M dispenser for those of you with a sweet tooth. There is also complimentary computer access at the Concierge desk for the sole purpose of printing your boarding pass. Internet is $12 a day. This is one of the few Marriott hotels that I found that actually charges for Internet access (WiFi or Wired). Would be a nice perk if they didn't have to charge. There is a restaurant called TWIST that we ate breakfast at every morning. They have a buffet that costs about $23 per person. We tried that the first day, but found it a bit lacking for the price. There were eggs, bacon, french toast, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal and oatmeal. There was a chef making fresh omelets and waffles. I mean, the food was top-notch quality but easily, the price could have been lowered to $15. The rest of the stay we opted for cheaper fare that included fresh fruit bowls and pancakes that were simply AWESOME! You should try the chocolate chip pancakes. Well worth the price (which was about $10). We didn't even attempt to eat dinner there, opting to eat at the IN-N-OUT burger around the corner (easily in 10-minute walking distance and a MUST EAT) or one of the eateries on the Mall adjacent to the hotel. Now with every great review comes a few gripes, and mind you, these gripes are minor but noteworthy.... Firstly, as you can tell from reading this review I am somewhat budget minded when it comes to traveling. The hotel was a bit of a splurge (I have a government discount) and I try to save money whenever possible -- especially since my business is paying for the trip. To valet park at the hotel, expect to pay just under $30 a day. You know what? Not worth it for me even though the alternative was a bit of a hassle. Adjacent to the hotel is garage parking. The cost is something around $4 an hour or $10 a day. There are several problems with the parking with the least of it being the cost (which is fine). First, since the garage is essentially general parking for the mall and the Hollywood tourists, it always packed. Expect to go down a few levels, in a conga line of cars, trying to find a spot. Finding a spot is not impossible, it just gets frustrating if you are in and out of the hotel several times a day. Next, there is no direct access from the garage into the hotel. You have to go lug your luggage across the garage to the elevator, up to the THIRD FLOOR, which turns out to be the mall itself. You then have a short walk around a corner or two to the entrance of the Renaissance Hotel. If you do this feat during the day, you have to dodge all the teenagers who inhabit this \"loudfest\" area with all your luggage in tow. And, since this Mall is always heavily populated, the elevators from parking garage to the third floor of the mall are often crowded, noisy, and certainly not the most welcoming way to access the hotel. This is what you get for going the cheap route when it comes to Parking. I will say, the Marriott Convention Center Hotel at the Burbank Airport charges $14 for onsite parking (no garage) so I still find the $10 charge to be a bargain, and thus, you have to accept the fact that it's not red-carpet service. You really can't go wrong with this hotel. It really is first-rate for service and comfort. It is situated squarely in the heart of tourist Hollywood only a few feet away from the Kodak Theater, Graumans Chinese Theater, The Hollywood Walk of Fame, El Capitan movie theater and the Hollywood Museum. There is a mall directly outside of the hotel filled with eateries, shopping and night activity. It's probably the most crowded area in the city, so be aware you are at ground zero of the Hollywood hub. I hope all of you enjoy your stay at the hotel as much as I did and will continue to have.", "Date": "June 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "murrieta, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Service and Perfect Location\u201d", "Author": "joslync", "ReviewID": "UR32054269", "Content": "We booked a room here and knew about the price, but we paid for the location.

On our way to the hotel we originally planned to stay at we pulled in here by accident and were impressed by how nice it was. So, when we check out of the previous hotel after a 1 night stay b/c it was so lousy, we decided to pay up and stay here. This was a decision that I did not regret. The Renaissance was a wonderful hotel. People are obviously drawn to the fact that the hotel is basically attached to the Hollywood and Highland shopping center. It's also on the same block as the Mann's Chinese Theatre. In fact Hollywood Blvd was closed off for the Star Trek premiere when we stayed there (although I did not get a chance to crash in on the fun). Right when you pull in the bell hop and valets are so friendly and courteous. It's exactly what I expected from the Renaissance chain... excellent customer service. Everyone was so helpful and efficient. When I requested extra sets of towels they came to my room right away. The valet always brought up the car very quickly. If I just needed to go in and out (not wanting to hassle going in the self-park lot) they'd look after my car. Let's just say that I spent a fair amount of money tipping the employees here and they deserved it. The room itself was well appointed, contemporary furnishings and very clean. Each room has a nice multi-level office desk which works great since I had a laptop with me. The bed was very comfortable w/soft sheets and many pillows. There was a nice 42\" flat panel TV as well as an iPod/iPhone charging dock which was a great touch. In the bathroom they provided Lather products which I absolutely love. They also allow late check-out until 3pm which is practically unheard of. One thing I couldn't quite put my head around was the fact that the only towel rack in the bathroom was a small one that was INSIDE the shower. I can see where they were going with this concept but with 2 people staying in the room it was hard to find places to let our towels dry (as we wanted to help conserve water and not wash the towels after one use).

I explained, after 20 hours traveling, we did not want to move, just for them to stop the noise.

Again I hadn\u2019t asked to be moved, or for any sort of compensation, only for something to be done about the noise. Eventually a security guard did visit the room and the last two nights passed without incident. It seems the compensation culture is so embedded that it gets in the way of a simple resolution.

ROOMS The rooms were average size rooms and had two double beds. They put a soft pillow topper on their beds which makes the beds much softer and very nice to sleep on. Like most hotels, all of their bedding is white and they don\u2019t have spreads. We love this, as they are able to wash the duvet covers and we aren\u2019t as squeamish about germs. The room was clean when we checked in. There were a few tiny smears on the desk chair fabric, wish that could have been cleaned. The rooms had a large flat screen TV and allowed a DVD hookup with an module they include which includes the ports right on it. We hooked up our DVD player and were able to watch a couple movies as a family. There is no mini bar or fridge in the room. But they were more than happy to provide us with a mini fridge when we asked for one, with no extra charge. We loved having a fridge for drinks and fruit. As always, there is internet in the rooms, but you have to pay for it. It was about $13 dollars. This is very standard. We had two laptops and used them the entire time. BATHROOM The bathroom is average size with a granite counter and the swing out shower rod for the tub/shower. They have a single sink, but with plenty of room on either side for items. I especially like that the bathroom has lots of light and you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in a hole. Be careful as we slipped on the wet floor and slick white tile when the floor got wet from the shower. LOCATION Loved the location of being right at the Kodak Theatre, Hollywood walk of stars, the Groman Chinese Theatre, and the Highland Center Mall. This is a very touristy part of town and I don\u2019t think I would normally stay in this area if it were just my husband and I, but our kids had never seen Hollywood and they got a kick out of it. This is a very central location for going to the beach (20 mins), Universal studios (7 mins) and China town. We liked having a mall attached to the RH so that we could take advantage of a quick bite for our kids (Quiznos, Steak and Potato, Johnny Rockets, Kabob place, Crepe place, Coldstone, Pizza place). They also have some nicer restaurants and my husband and I slipped out and had dinner at \u201cThe Grill\u201d while the kids had room service. PARKING For $36 per day you can have valet parking. You can come and go as many times as you please. You do need to tip the attendant a few dollars each time you come in and out, but the service is really really fast. We\u2019d call down as we were leaving the room and the car would be sitting there already. They \u201cRUN\u201d when you call them. If you plan on walking or using public transportation, you can arrive at the hotel and park for just $10 a day at the Highland Center Mall which is right next door. Basically the Highland Center charges you $10 a day (if you leave your car there many days at a time) or each time you exit the parking facility they charge you $10. The Valet at the hotel gives you both options. HOTEL In GENERAL The hotel has a small but very nice pool with cabanas that you can sit in to shade you from the sun. The pool\u2019s max depth is 4\u20196\u201d so no diving allowed. I can imagine that during the summer the pool area can be very crowded as it is quite small, but during April with cooler temps, there wasn\u2019t anyone there. There is NO hot tub, just the pool. The hotel has room service which we tried once with our children and it was good, pretty standard and came on time. I thought their prices were fair, not exorbitant. The one thing I would not use again is the hotel\u2019s Valet Laundery Service. We use this service at many hotels we stay at as we pack super light. My husband\u2019s dress pants got a stain on them and I sent them in by 9am and they were returned by 6pm promptly. The cost was $9.75 (which is a little on the high side, normally $7-8) Then they tacked on an extra $3.50 for a service charge. His pants ended up costing us $13.25! I thought this was quite high. Most hotels don\u2019t tack on the extra service charge. There is a dry cleaning place just caddy corner to the hotel and I should have used that place instead. As we were on a 9 day trip, I also found that there is a fluff and dry place right down a few blocks at 7359 Sunset Blvd called Le Superwash. They were willing to come to the hotel and pick up our laundry, wash, dry and fold it and then deliver back to the hotel for only $1.25 per pound, with a minimum of 20 lbs. It was great! We had about 18 pounds of laundry (4 days worth for a family of four) and got our laundry back all washed and folded. Once again, I only brought enough clothes for 4 days and then had it washed and therefore we could travel light. I really liked the hotel and it\u2019s location. The hotel was clean and it was very quiet considering it was in a busy section of town.

It was a great deal for this price. We stayed two nights. The hotel is clean and convenient for the Hollywood and Highland Center (a random and unpreposing spread out group of stores/shops. You feel as though you are walking in the subway, very unattractive. However there is a Starbucks and CPK there which are great if you have kids and want a quick and affordable meal. The hotel also has a coffee bar which serves excellent if pricey coffee and pastries and a restaurant which we didn't try. The staff are helpful and friendly. You basically have to use the valet parking ($28/day). They have a ridiculous system of having to bring the car up for you to get one item from inside. I just wanted to go down and get it from the car, instead spent twenty minutes waiting for them to bring the car up. Of course they expect a tip for this.... Our room on the 8th floor overlooking pool, compact and clean. Comfy beds, nice duvets. Two small towels only. Had to ask for more. Room was noisy due to elevator noise but heard no noise from other guests at all. Ask for a room away from the elevator. It is a surprisingly intrusive 'whooshy' sound! Breakfast was very expensive and not worth it (room service). Go to the coffee bar or Starbucks. The pool was cool and there is no hot tub (disappointing). The pool is also only 4 feet deep. Lots of beds though and plenty of towels. They are a bit slow cleaning up though. We were there to visit American Girl, La Brea Tar Pits and teh mission our daughter is studying. Convenient for all three (though my GPS didn't recognize 'The Grove' as an address...) One major problem which was resolved: I was waiting to ask the concierge about a place to eat. The people in front were asking about \"Mam Mia' tickets. I thought I had somehow missed that this show was in town. When my turn, asked if there were tickets available for tonight. 'Yes' said the concierge and proceeded to book them through Ticketmaster. She printed out and as I walked upstairs I noticed they were for 2 weeks away. Went back down, concierge was gone. Explained problem to another. He said he would 'look into it'. Half an hour alter he appeared at our door with $190 in hand. Said his colleague had made a mistake and the show didn't open until the following week. Apologized and gave me the money. I wouldn't hestitate to stay here again at this price. By the way, the area gets pretty seedy within a few blocks. Yet another hotel which charges for internet ($12.95/day) Outrageous. If you sit on the terrace by the pool you can pick up Starbucks internet free if you have the Starbucks code (buy a card for coffee and it comes with it).

I arrived at the hotel on a shared van shuttle. The driver pulled onto the driveway and jumped out. Immediately, the doorman/valet approached the driver and told him he needed to move the van because he was blocking someone. The driver began to argue with this guy. The argument developed, which drew the attention of the other valets. The driver ended up using obsenities with the doorman. While all of this was going on, I got my own bag from the van and went into the hotel. (I had pre-paid the driver.)

The woman at the Front Desk, however, was horrible. She didn't welcome me (or more acurately welcome me back). Additionally, she didn't tell me anything about the hotel.

When I said, \"it was okay\", the Front Desk Manager wanted to know why. When I explained my issues, she offered me Marriott Reward Points.

I arrived before check-in time, but was put up in a room immediately. Construction was going on in the \"zen\" rock garden in the lobby the entire time I was there, so that part was not so \"zen.\" Otherwise the front lobby area was great--plenty of comfy seats to wait for friends or just decompress. First off, I would recommend when booking a room that you request to be on a high-up floor. I was on the 6th floor and my view was of a concrete roof, not of any of the beautiful Hollywood skylines you've seen in other pictures. It wasn't such a big deal to me, seeing as how I was not spending my own money to stay there, nor was I going to be in my room very much. The room was very spacious and contained a king-sized bed. The furniture style was modern, but not the most stylish. For some reason it felt like it had been decorated by someone in their 70s trying to pick out furniture that they thought was cool. The television was a big tube television, which surprised me, I thought they would have flat screen TVs by now, but not a big deal. The bathroom was nice, with a crescent shower rod and nice toiletries from Lather (The facial soap was LOVELY.), and a vanity mirror and hairdryer plugged in ready to go. Unfortunately, no bathrobes were to be found! Some local magazines were left on the table for my use, and a book of photographs of the area which was a nice touch. I was disappointed that there was no mini bar in the room, all food requests had to be made via the room service, which tacks on a 18% gratuity to your order. However, ordering room service was a pleasant experience. They greet you by your last name when they answer the phone, which is simultaneously nice and creepy at the same time. I ordered room service several times throughout my stay, and orders always came much quicker than I would have expected them to. The servers were courteous, always asking if they could enter the room before doing so. I ordered a variety of items during my time there: BBQ chicken quesadilla, berry parfait, eggs, roasted potatoes, a boxed roastbeef sandwich with chips, macaroni salad, and apple, seafood pasta (from Twist restaurant), mixed berry bowl, breakfast bento box. The food was satisfactory, but not spectacular. Portions were not huge, but not skimpy. My favorite item was probably the BBQ chicken quesadilla. A USA Today paper greeted me outside my door every morning, the wake-up call service was sufficient, as well as requests for the cleaning service to come later in the day during a specified time. The meeting rooms were fine, nothing to write home about but clean and serviceable. On the day I was scheduled to check out, my flight was not until the evening. The hotel allowed me to keep my bags in the luggage room no problem. (That night I ate at The Grill, which is in the Highline complex and is affiliated with the hotel. Ordered the chicken pesto penne, it was WAY too salty. Again, food was not spectacular.) I found the bed comforter way too warm--I actually found myself waking up in the middle of the night, back completely covered in sweat--but otherwise the bed was lovely. The pillows were a bit too soft for my liking though. The in-room internet package was great- around 13 dollars for 24 hours worth of access, complete with free local and national calls. The location was fantastic. The fact that the hotel was connected to the shopping center was fabulous for non-drivers like me, and the fact that I didn't have much time between meetings to explore. The fact that I could just step outside my hotel and be right on Hollywood Blvd was pretty spectacular. The Mann's Chinese Theater was great, and there was an adorable women's clothing store called Varga where I picked a great jacket. All in all, I found the customer service to be excellent and the rooms clean, roomy, and pleasant. Would recommend staying here if you have the cash.

This was a sightseeing trip with my family; I chose this hotel because I wanted something that was in a good location for touring around, and where we could sleep comfortably. I booked the hotel a couple of months ago, on the hotel website. At that time I requested the club level. I was willing to pay a bit extra for the convenience of the continental breakfast; I could not find a rate that included breakfast otherwise. When I got to the hotel, I learned that the lounge would not be open for 3 of the 6 days we'd be there. At my request, we were moved to a non-club level room, at a lower rate. They did not reduce the rate for our last night, however. (The rate was going to go up because of the New Year). Thankfully, however, the hotel is connected to the Hollywood and Highland Mall, and we did not need to have breakfast in the hotel. My husband brought up coffee from the Starbucks each morning, and we did not pay the outrageous prices for the hotel breakfast buffet. There was no minibar, but we did not miss that. I did notice that there was no in-room safe. We did not use room service, and housekeeping was adequate. The hotel was in a great location for sightseeing- we went all over L.A. and had a great time. There is an on-site car rental (Hertz) which was convenient. We parked in the mall for $10 a night rather than pay the $29 for the hotel's valet parking. The hotel was functional and served its purpose as a base for sightseeing, and a place to sleep and shower. It was in no way luxurious, but it met our needs.

It's held here every other year, so this was my third time at this hotel. Things have definitely gone downhill. I'll start with the pluses: The spa was nice. The room service veggie burger was really good. The bed was comfortable. My room was relatively spacious. I requested a refrigerator and they brought it within 5 minutes. But let's talk about the bad stuff. First of all, there was no minibar. Well, actually there _was_ a minibar-- it was just empty, with a note on it that it was \"being renovated\" and that one should call room service for food and drinks. Not exactly what you want to see when you're arriving very late and just want a Diet Coke. I was grateful my flight hadn't been delayed-- at least I got there before room service closed for the night. Why would you leave the minibar in the room if it's empty? Room service was also hilariously bad. I'd seen some reviews that said the homemade granola was good, so I figured I'd give it a shot one morning. When the guy brought up the food, he lifted off the silver platter to reveal... 2 boxes of Kellogg's granola! I said that I thought it was homemade, and he said oh, sorry, we ran out so I just brought you this. I'm glad I didn't order an omelette-- I probably would've gotten something from McDonald's. (They did eventually bring me the real granola, and it was pretty good-- nothing to write home about, though.) But the worst thing was the housekeeping. I noticed a nasty-looking red stain on the bedskirt and left a note for housekeeping asking them to please change it. When I got back to the room that night, all the sheets had been changed, but not the bedskirt. I ran into the maid the following day, pointed out the stain, and asked her to change it. She looked at it, shrugged, and told me, \"It's just ketchup.\" I was dumbfounded. Um, 1) it wasn't MY ketchup, 2) even if it _is_ something innocuous, I don't want to look at it! I asked her to please change it anyway and she made a big deal out of having to _call_ someone for a new bedskirt. Anyway, while it was convenient to be at the conference's official hotel, I would seriously consider staying down the street at the Roosevelt next time. There may be some urban legends running around about the cleanliness of the Roosevelt's pool (google it), but at least you can get a Diet Coke from your minibar.", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cPretty good hotel in a decent location\u201d", "Author": "NYCFrequent_traveler", "ReviewID": "UR22318454", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights at the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel using Marriott points, in November 2007.

The foyer / valet entrance was very welcoming with a mosaic and wall of water shielding guests from the dust and hustle of the main road on the other side. Check in was smooth and faultless, though we had no offer of help with our bags. On opening the door the light flooded in through the window and we immediately noticed how light and airy the room was. We had a queen bed each, and there was a desk in the room that could be tucked away to be less of an inconvenince. The bathroom was generouse, but the bath itself was the lowest bath I have ever seen, though the complimentary soaps and shampoos were worth being there alone & the overhead shower came with 6 different settings, including turbo massage which was amazing on my achy back. Out of our window we could see the Hollywood and Highland complex which our hotel was a part of, and Hollywood Boulevard, as well as a look out over LA itself. The entrance / exit of the hotel for guests to visid the H&H complex was on the second floor and as sson as we stepped out you could feel the stunning LA heat. Overlooking the lovely Hollywood sign, with pleanty of retaraunts and shops, in theory you'd never have to leave the hotel. It's smack in the middle of all the Hollywood sights including Mann's Chinese Theatre, Hollywood Boulevard, Ripley's Believe it or Not Odditorium, The Hollywood Wax museum, and Mels Drive-In Diner!! The Metro line in directly to the left of the H&H complex (providing you have Virgin to your right) and it is so simple to use that I used it twice and I hate public transport in different countries. From here you can get to Universal City and Universal Studios in one stop, and we paid $1.25 each, each way, and it really is worth the visit.

It is smack in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard (Graumans, Kodak theatre) and in the middle of Hollywood and Highland complex which houses several eating options, from takeaway (one night we got a takeout from California Pizza and ate in room...) to formal. Also if you want to take any tours, many leave from Graumanns. But hotel did disappoint... Our first room, although a non smoking hotel, stank of smoke. Plus it was next to the ice machine on that floor which seemed to be leaking and smelt of gas. We asked to be moved which was not possible that night (we were in a suite, the quantities of which are limited). We were promised to be moved the next day and told just to leave our suitcases which would be automatically transferred. Next day before we left for the day I checked at reception re new room...and nobody knew anything about it. After a while they gave us a new room number. When we got back that night....no one knew anything about it.But we eventually did get the room. But communication and organisation seems to be a recurring problem. Even when we left, we had pre paid the travel agent, but the room charges were on the bill, and it took a lot of checking before this was rectified. The rooms itself, a 2 room suite was not great. It is billed as a chic boutique hotel, but in truth the (final ) room we had, while not exactly shabby, was just not great. Maybe the high rates are the privilege of being on Hollywood Boulevard, We took a 2 room suite as I was travelling with my 16 year old son, the sofa in the lounge folded down. But when folded down, it practically reached the TV, cutting the room in 2, so effectively when the bed was down half of the room was unusable. On the good side. A coffee/ tea machine, ironing board which made life easier. To be honest if I went to Hollywood again I might well stay in this hotel purely for location, but the whole experience left me a bit flat", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cFour stars Hotel\u201d", "Author": "doledes", "ReviewID": "UR19466823", "Content": "After finding a good rate on the Renaissance web site, I decided to book a 4-night stay at this hotel (180\u20ac for a triple room). I have to say that the hotel met my expectations. This hotel is rated 5 stars but guests must be ready not to find that kind of luxury typical of a real 5 star hotel. I arrived at 8 pm but my room wasn't ready (although I informed them at the moment of my booking about my scheduled arrival time). Check-in staff told me my room would have been available in 30 min., so we went to the mezzanine bar in order to have a cup of tea (the lobby bar didn't serve hot beverages in the evening). The mezzanine bar is very big and there was a huge selection of different types of tea. The tea was very good and not pricey (about 3\u20ac and it was served together with some complementary honey). After that we came back to the lobby at the scope of completing the check-in procedure (check-in staff asked my mobile number in order to call me once the room would have been ready). The time we waited was well worth because we had a room located on the 18th floor (one of the highest) with a beatiful view of the Hollywood sign (this was another request made when I booked the room). A bellman went with us and showed the basic features of the room. The room had two very comfortable queen beds and was quiet spacious (about 30 sq. mt)., no particularly luxurious and with no state of the art technology features (no plasma screen). The soundproof system wasn't exceptional but the BIG con I found in this hotel was the bathroom: it wasn't dirty but all the facilities looked VERY old and 1.000 miles far from what a guest can expect to find in a 4 or 5 star hotel. The location is great for people who want to stay in Hollywood or are not renting a car (two steps from the walk of fame and all the other Hollywood attractions). Finally, I colud check out directly through the TV system on the day I left the hotel; a good way to save some minutes. All in all the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel is a good option who is not renting a car and looks for a good hotel with all the services a guest can need (spa, swimming pool, etc.).

Chose it purely on its location as it was fairly near many sites and we didn't have a hire car. Check-in was unsatisfactory as the young man on the desk was surly and rude. Every other member of the check in team were welcoming guests with a cheery smile and a \"Welcome to the Renaissance\" with the exception of him. He thought there was a problem with our booking and kept wandering off to another room to make phone calls lasting about 15 minutes. At one point we had to ask another member of staff to go and find him. He didn't once apologise for the delay which was inexcusable as we had been travelling all night and were exhausted. I asked him to explain what the problem was and he started talking whilst walking off to the other room again so I couldn't hear what he was saying. Despite this the room was adequate and clean. As other reviewers have said it was close to many amenities such as shops, restaurants, chinese theatre, walk of fame etc. We walked further on from all the razzamatazz and found a restaurant called and Musso and Benny's recommended by the guidebook. It was heaving until about 7.30 when everyone leaves to go to their shows and theatres. The food is like something your mum would make (sorry mum) so i don't know what all the fuss is about but the waiters are great. Most of them are way over 60 and a bit grumpy! I wouldn't want to spend any longer than 2 days in LA. it isn't really my sort of place. We took a bus to santa monica beach on the sunday. It is very busy but we enjoyed walking around. The hotel advised us not to take a bus there as this is the city of the car after all but it was so simple and only cost $1.25 each way. Rodeo Drive and Beverley Hills are worth a look but the restaurants nearby are a bit snooty. Took a trolley bus ride around all the stars' homes which was amusing and was very cheap (sorry can't remember how much but it was cheap) Check out was better but there is still an attitude problem from some members of staff. Made a big mistake of booking an airport shuttle to take us to LAX on the way home. Our driver took nearly 3/4 hour driving to other hotels, driving back to ours, having a cigarette until we thought we were going to miss our plane.

I loved this hotel and would highly recommend it. While it was out of downtown LA itself, it offered us the holiday we were looking for. It can be daunting staying in a city that you don't know sometimes as you don't know where to go, but there was enough on our doorstep to keep us entertained. The hotel room was fine, nothing overly fancy but a lot better than basic. We were on the 14th floor overlooking the pool. There was no noise whatsoever to be heard from our room. Another reviewer commented on the fact that there was no extractor fan in the bathroom. We stayed in 3 hotels on our trip and none of them had a working fan, which surprised me. The bathroom in this hotel was larger than our prevous hotel (Westin, Times Square, New York). The old-fashioned TV was a bit of a surprise but we ordered a movie all the same one night and no complaints. The lobby area was nice. You could get lovely ice-cold water from a dispenser which had lemons, oranges, grapefruits etc. in it giving the water a lovely refreshing taste. There was also a m&m dispensing machine, which gave free m&m's. Handy when you're waiting around the lobby! The hotel adjoins the Hollywood + Highland Centre which was just buzzing day and night. It was full of shops, eateries, cinema, bowling alley, the Grauman Theatre, Kodak Theatre. The Walk of Fame was right outside the Centre. The Centre offers an Elephant Card at the Information Centre on the ground floor, which offers discounts on a lot of the shops and restaurants. We ate breakfast and dinner in the Centre every day. We would head off an a trip for the day after breakfast. All trips departed from the ground floor of the Centre, which was practically on our doorstep. We walked the Walk of Fame as it was on our doorstep. We took the Starline trip to the Stars Homes, which was very good as it was only a small open top bus and the driver was very interesting. We took the Starline Hop-on-Hop-off bus which we didn't enjoy as it was a pre-recorded tour and was hard to hear. We took a train to the Universal Studios as it was just handier for us. The train is only a stones throw from the hotel. It only costs 1.25 for a on-way trip which is great value. Universal Studios was a fantastic day out. I would say that was the best money spent on our whole trip (having done New York & San Francisco also). We didn't have a car so we were very happy to have all the entertainment on our doorstep. We did walk up the street looking for somewhere else to eat but couldn't find anywhere. I wasn't taken by the area just up the street, but there was enough choice in the Centre for eating in, so it didn't bother us really. The only annoying thing along the walk of fame was all the people dressed up trying to get you to take a photo and then look for a tip.

We'd been offered to down grade at the same expense and they could give us another room with a rollaway. Now, check the rates of this hotel and see if you'd like to sleep on a rollaway! As soon as we arrived we were asked to shop for an hour while our room was finished. We weren't happy about that, but agreeable and asked where to go and how to get there. So at 4 we returned and it still wasn't ready, that clerk asked about the rollaway and that it takes an hour and half to clean a room not just an hour. So we were asked again to go shop....we declined and said we'd sit in the lounge area not too far away. 4:30 came and went with no word on the room. I went back to the desk because we'd become invisible to all but the bellman who kept glancing at us while everyone else checked in and headed up merrily to their rooms. The new desk clerk said Sorry, it shouldn't be much longer. 5 p.m. (really 8 p.m. at home and in our brains and stomachs) still no room and the desk clerk called housekeeping and someone would physically go check on the room and see how it was coming. She assured me she'd come get me and let me know either way how it was going.....ready or not. Apparently she leaves at 5, so left without getting me or telling me anything. She did tell us our room was an Upgrade so she wouldn't change it if it were her....so not sure how the previous clerk thought a rollaway would be a great idea. 5:30, still no one coming to tell us anything and I went back to the desk...this time getting a room or we're leaving.....and was told your room is ready. Guess they didn't feel the need to come get us and tell us. There was no exceptional service at this hotel, no out of the way things done but we also didn't ask for anything. My goal after checking in was to never talk to anyone at the front desk again since 3 of the clerks I'd already met were no help.

Stayed here for 6 nites in early July right over the 4th of July holiday with my brother as were in town to visit family and do the whole tourist thing. Asked for a room with the view of the Hollywood sign and was given a wonderful high floor room overlooking the Hollywood Hills and sign. Room was clean and comfortable but our bathroom had no fan (my only complaint of the room). We choose to self park in the underground parking garage which is attached to the hotel and paid $10 to park overnite. U can reach the hotel by taking the garage elevator to the 3rd floor and briefly walking through the outdoor mall to the hotel entrance on the same level. The costs of going in and out during the day were anywhere from the $2 to $4 dollars but we never paid more than $10 so its cheaper than $29 valet charge. We ate breakfast several times at the hotel restaurant Twist and loved the menu - tried both the breakfast buffets and menu entrees and they are worth the price. Its also the same menu for room service from the restaurant so if you looking for something low budget there is Mel's Diner and IHOP within walking distance. Tried some of the restaurants in the adjacent Mall and found them to be very good. Especially The Grill (massive steaks) and Trastevere (upscale Italian). Went to both in shorts and polo shirts and saw people in t-shirts/shorts so although they appear upscale you can go casual and don't feel out of place. It's a Mall after all ! The hotel is within driving minutes of Universal and Burbank. (Burbank Airport is closer than LAX to the hotel so think about it if u can get a flight there from your hometown). West Hollywood is just minutes away down Sunset Blvd. and has lots of trendy bars, clubs and restaurants. WH is where the nightlife scene is - there is not much going on in Hollywood at nite. Santa Monica/Malibu beaches are about 30 minutes driving from the hotel and easy to reach. Beverly Hills is also easy to get too and about 20-25 minutes from the hotel. Tried Starline Tours for the movie stars homes tour and happened to catch Dr. Phil pulling into his driveway. Yes it was that Dr. Phil and he did wave back to all of us on the tour bus, lol For any movie buffs considering doing studio tours the best are Universal, Warner Brothers or Sony/Columbia Pictures. The guides we had were first class and knew the industry and studio lots well. We got to see many sound stages and sets.

He was booked a room here for part of a group booking for a work event. His work event was over at Hollywood and Vine and this was pretty close. For the last several years, his company would always book the Holiday Inn because their work event would be on a Thursday night and rooms would be around $150. But this year, the event fell on a Friday night and so the room rates were pretty close at the Holiday Inn so the event manager decided to book the Renaissance instead. I am glad they did as don't really care for staying at the Holiday Inn and chains like that. We arrived Friday early afternoon and valeted the car. I believe the rates for valet is around $20-25. Check in was fairly easy. In the entrance there's a lounge and little coffee bar. We got to our room quickly and since were were used to staying at the Holiday Inn, the Renaissance was a great relief. We had a view of the city and we could also see the pool. The room was nice, clean and modern. The bathroom stocks Lather products which are great. I know its handy when the products are good quality and smell nice. We were a bit hungry and I needed a pair of shoes for the event so we walked over to the behemoth Hollywood and Highland entertainment, dining and shopping complex. We had a Japanese cream puff at Beard Papa (awesome). There's tons of your typical shops in there. There's a movie theatre as well as a bunch of restaurants, Starbucks and a bowling alley. We only stayed a night and were out for most of our stay so I can't really talk about service, etc at the hotel. It was pretty good for our short stay. My husband used the pool in the morning while I went to Runyon Canyon for a hike with friends. The pool looked great and I wished that I had tried it. There were cabanas and a bar in the pool area so I am sure it can get quite lively. I definitely would stay again. There's obviously tons of great hotels in the LA area but if you want to be close to things like Hollywood, Universal Studios, etc. This is probably a good choice.

We were really keen to get a room with a view of the hollywood hills and the hollywood sign and we certainly got it. We were on the 18th floor with fantastic view - well worth paying a little extra. We ate in the hotel every morning for breakfast. They had a really good selection of cold and warm food and I would say it was well worth it. Staff were really friendly, rooms were a good size (what you would expect from an American hotel) and the hotel bar was quite small but nice to have an end of evening drink. The hotel is located right next to a mall with a small selection of shops and a number of restaurants and eateries. You are also a stone's throw from the Kodak Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre. As you are so close to these I would recommend doing these sights first thing in the morning. We went down at 7am and there was not another person about so we had the whole place to ourselves - fantastic. Everyone says about hiring a car but we found taxi's (and buses) worked for us. We used taxi's to get down to Rodeo Drive (about $20 each way) and then actually got the bus down to santa Monica Pier where we walked down to Venice Beach. The concierge in the hotel will be able to provide you details of how to use the bus and where to get it from. One of the highlights for us was having a tour of LA in a 1966 convertible cadillac. You get a private tour of the city and let your driver know where you want to go and he makes sure you see what you want to but then shows you some other sites that you may not have been aware of. Although this was $300 we thought it was one of the highlights of our trip. Another must is going down to Santa Monica Pier. We got the bus down here and then walked along the beach down to Venice Beach which is 'interesting' to say the least. One other think that we enjoyed was going for a early evening drink at Yamshiro's which is very close to the hotel. It is a Japanese restaurant set on a hill with great views over the city.

We decided to go anyhow, and honestly it was only 40 minutes from the time that we left. The key is to leave early in the morning. We left around 6:30 in the morning and got there around 7:10. The park opened at 8:00 but we were able to park our car go to the tram and by the time we bought our tickets it basically opened up. I recommend this hotel for families with young kids, because it has a really nice pool. The temperature for the pool was perfect and the deepest part of the pool is no bigger then 5 feet deep. Also my kids seemed to enjoy the fact that the hotel had free m&m's for the hotel guest.. My kids everyday picked up some m&m's and loved it. I felt like the staff really treated my family great. They made us feel very special and my family really liked that. The only members of the staff we didn't feel that really went all out was the concierge area. They did what they were supposed to do, but I didn't feel that they took the extra step to make us happy. They were still very good, but after tipping them, I feel that they should take the extra step, to make us happy. For example, I asked them to recommend a restaurant. They recommended one but they didn't call the restaurant and make the reservation for us. Most concierge that I have worked with in the past, would make the phone call and reserve us a table. We stayed on the 15th floor and had a beautiful room, with a view of the hollywood sign. I just asked them if they had the ability to accomodate us with a room that viewed the hollywood sign and they said no problem. Overall the saying goes you get what you pay for. If you have the money to pay almost 300 a night, this is the right hotel for you, because you are treated like royalty. Last thing that was kinda negative. They have a valet charge of 29.00 a night or a self parking charge of 10.00 a night. We ended up paying the valet charge because we would go somewhere, come back and then go back out somewhere. If you do that for the self parking, I believe that you have to pay each time you come and go, but I could be wrong.

Taxis are also readily available outside the hotel. We used one to get to the Beverly Center mall which is about 5 miles away. The room was just as I had expected. Tea/coffee making facilities were appreciated, and the room was a good size. I booked directly through the Marriott website and there is an option to request a high floor which increases your chance of seeing the Hollywood sign from your room. You can also see it from the pool which we used a couple of times. It was very pleasant. I did not eat in the hotel or use the mini bar \u2013 you don\u2019t really need to as there is a convenience store across the street and the old- fashioned Mel\u2019s Diner for breakfast about 5 minutes away. I paid \u00a3530 to stay from May 22nd for 4 nights.

GREAT VIEW! ........ 7) SUBWAY - If you aren't renting a car - the subway is located right at the hotel and a great option for arriving from LAX Enjoy your stay!! We sure did.

I was told that instead I could get a take-out breakfast box and eat it outside on the street, or pay for room service. Finally, on my last night, there was a party going on in the room opposite me at 4am which spilled out into the hall. With loud music, people banging on my door, prank calling my room and shouting just metres away from where I was sleeping. I called security and reception several times and they refused to do anything about this. I then noticed that several guests at the party were Renaissance staff. This went on until 6am and when I complained to reception, they hung up on me. I was quite frankly appalled by the problems and service levels of this hotel and would never stay there again.

As we'd never visited LA I read a lot of reviews of what district to stay in as well as which hotel. In the end, following reviews of this property here we booked club level rooms at the Rennaissance Hollywood. Firstly I would say Hollywood is a pretty good place to base yourself for a first time visit to LA. It pretty is what LA is all about - we did the bus tour, a limo tour of star's homes and the Madame Taussads and Guiness World of Records attractions, which are right on the doorstep of this hotel. So it is very well placed. Self parking was $10 a day in the big parking next door - where there were also loads of shops and a cinema. The check-in staff were very polite and helpful. Room itself was pretty good - quite small for a 'suite' - once a single fold out bed was up there wasn't a lot of room. Also the door to the bathroom opened outward which was unusual, and automatically closed which the kids didn't like. The blind which covered the window was a bit tatty but still worked well to shut out the morning sunlight. Beds were very comfortable though The club lounge was good - with good snacks in the evening and a very good breakfast. Not too busy either. There was one member of staff in there but he didn't 'interact' with anyone, just sat watching his PC screen. I was talked into booking a stretch limo by the concierge to see the 'homes of the stars'. This was a rip off however (Topline I think it was). The driver wasn't that interested - we didn't see half the houses mentioned on the blurb and we finished 30 minutes early! When you're paying that sort of money you expect better. I fed this back to the concierge who took my details and said he'd be in touch although he never has.

I chose this hotel due to its proximity to Hollywood attractions that I thought would interest my teenage neice and her friend. The hotel did not disappoint. The Mezzanine level of the hotel connects to the adjacent entertainment/shopping complex, so we could easily access restaurants, movies, and tourist attractions like the Kodak Theater and the Graumann's Chinese theater. We took a Starline Tour and walked the Hollywood Walk of Fame from the hotel. We were also several miles away from the Warner Brothers Studio VIp tour which we also took. The only complaint I had with the hotel was that upon check-in when I inquired about the rollaway bed I had requested I was told it would be sent right up. When time passed and it was not there and we were all wanting to go out I decided to go ahead with our plans and expected the bed would be there upon return. It was not. I called and this time I was told the person who would deliver the bed was on break, but that it should be there in twenty minutes. An hour later I called again and when the person on the other line said \"At your service\" I told them that he needed to answer the phone differently based on my experience thus far with the hotel staff. The bed was immediately delivered. When the man who delivered the bed saw there were four of us sharing the room he left and returned not only with extra towels, but extra coffee cups, shampoo and conditioner. I very much appreciated this attention to detail! We ordered room service one night and the food was delivered within the time promised and att he right temperature. The man who delivered the food said that the hotel was very busy and that we should just leave the table outside the door and not to call for pick-up. I was disappointed to see that the table stayed outside the room overnight and was removed mid-morning of the following day. The food itself was delicious and there were no complaints from any of us about it. The only problem we had was they only gave us two flatware services--despite it clearly being four distinct meals with four beverages, etc. Luckily, we had plastic flatware in the room from an earlier take-out meal so we \"made do\" using a spoon when a fork might have worked better, etc. The room was clean and the pull-down window shade blocked the sun nicely so we were able to sleep well even though we were on Eastern Standard Time and a bit out of sorts with the Pacific time schedule. All in all it was a good visit. The bell staff delivered our car in a timely fashion though I was a bit annoyed when at check-out two employees chatted away while we waited with our luggage needing to leave for the airport. The driver stopped, backed up, and then stopped so that we could not get to the car. I felt the reason he did this was that the bellman were busy loading the luggage of guests ahead of us and that if he pulled up we might load the car ourselves rather than waiting for the assistance of the bellmen depriving them of their tip. I don't know that this was the case, but it was annoying to me as we were watching the clock and anxious to get on our way. It was frustrating to see our car yards a way and the driver and another employee (the person who we had given our car receipt to for picking up the car) just joking around while we waited and waited and waited...... Other than that the staff was friendly and helpful. I used the concierge's service several times for directions and they were always on the mark. The gift shop at the hotel is very tiny and cramped, but almost anything you need is within walking distance to the hotel. There is a Starbucks in the adjacent shopping center and another right down the street, as well as another take-out place with fruit bowls, pastries, breakfast sandwiches, etc.-I think it was called Fatima's.

Then at 2.00 am there was an unbelievable amount of banging on the floor from the room above.

This hotel is fabulous! The staff was friendly and helpful. The check-in and check-out was quick and efficient, and we had a comfortable room with a wonderful view of the Hollywood sign and the Capitol Records tower. The complex that surrounds the hotel was great, you almost didn't need to leave the hotel complex if you didn't want to. There were restaurants, a movie theatre and plenty of shops to keep us busy. The Renaissance Hotel is a pick up spot for a lot of the tours of the surrounding areas. Also, there is a Metro Station on the back side of the hotel where you can catch a train that goes directly to and from Universal Studios for $2.50 round trip. We spent a day at the Universal Studios park and didn't have to worry about renting a car or taking a cab there. If you are going to take a Hollywood Stars Homes and City Tour, I would advise you NOT to take a Star Line Tour. The buses are filthy and unmaintained, they are unorganized, and the customer service is terrible. The half day tour that we took was so bad, we couldn't wait for it to be over. It was a hassle from beginning to end. At night the hotel complex comes to life with people strolling the streets viewing the stars on the Walk of Fame, taking snapshots of the Chinese Theatre, The Kodak Theatre, and watching the many street performers that come out at night to entertain and take pictures with the tourists. Our final night in the area, we went for dinner at a beautiful little Cuban restaurant called El Floridita. It was a five minute cab ride from the hotel and the food and ambiance was great. We had an excellent meal and enjoyed the live band and salsa dancing that the restaurant features on Saturday nights. All in all we had a wonderful three day stay.

We booked an executive king and a standard room with 2 doubles and requested connecting rooms and a roll away bed. All of our requests were met. The hotel is located atop of the Highland center with an array of shops, cafes, cinemas and restaurants to explore....fabulous spot. We were checked in efficiently and with a smile and told about the concierge floor offering breakfast for a $30 charge per room extra. We thought this great value and accepted this offer. Breakfast varied each day but there was cereal, fruit and some offering of either bacon, sausage and eggs each morning. They also had a variety of juices and starbucks coffee in the lounge. There were also breads and pastries on offer. In the evening there were snacks and during the day you counld pop up and grab a softdrink or water if you wanted also some pieces of fruit. Our rooms were very nice and clean, our executive king was also handicap accessable, so we had a huge bathroom and plenty of extra space. The room with the doubles had a smaller bathroom, but both rooms had mini bar, amoir and a large closet. We found the location to be perfect and used the train system which is located right in the Highland Complex, to get down to the Staples Center one night when we went to the basketball. It is a fast, safe and inexpensive way to get about, without the hassles of parking and LA traffic to contend with. An all day ticket is only $5 per person, and can be used on the trains or buses. When we finished with our passes at the end of each day we handed them on to some less fortunate folk, (which seem to frequent the Hollywood area)...who made use of them to get to where they were going. We booked tours through starline, which are just on the street in a kiosk at the bottom of the Highland center on Sunset. They will heavily discount for a family group...just ask, smile and be patient...we saved just under $100 for a family of 6. We did tons of walking and sightseeing around Hollywood and at all times felt safe. One day we walked from the hotel to the Beverly Center....we walked down Highland, onto Melrose and all the way to La Cienega and to the Mall....it took us 3 and a half hours...with stops for shopping, drinks and icecreams along the way...what a fabulous walk that was, enjoying Hollywood by foot is really something. ....I digress...back to the Hotel...we found the staff very friendly, the rooms spotless, the food delicious...even room service was very fast and arrived hot and fresh at very reasonable prices...so we took advantage of this a lot with snacks in bed while watching tv for everyone, almost nightly. The manager told me, when we were checking out that the rooms are due for a refurbishment, and that they were going to be fabulous, with flat screen tvs, new linens (nice already) and new pillows (which need changing), carpeting etc. The refurb is due to start early 2008. The spa is being built now too. Whilst there we saw, Judith Light in the lobby, we saw Tom DeLong from Angels and Airwaves checking in, we saw Jack Nicholson and Lindsay Lohan at the basketball, we saw the guy from Supersize Me...pushing his child in a stroller along Melrose and my husband saw one of the Baldwin brothers driving down Hollywood Blvd...but wasnt sure which one it was...so if you are into celebrity spotting....they really do get out and about in Los Angeles...we saw some and were kind of excited lol.

Adjacent to the Kodak Theater, Mann Chinese Theater, and Hollywood and Highland shopping center. 2) Cleaniless - Hotel was clean and comfortable. Bed was really nice to sleep on. 3) Public Transportation - The LA's red line light rail is located about a block away. The Red Line can take you to Universal Studios, Pantages Theater, and China Town (via transfer). 4) Great views from higher floors. Here are some of the things that I didnt like about the hotel. 1) Location - Its tough to get in and out of this hotel because the entrance to the hotel is along a small driveway that leads to the parking structure for the Hollywood and Highland shopping center. Hollywood and Highland streets are very busy and typical of Southern California gridlock. 2) Valet Service - Very busy hotel. Valet service can take up to 5 to 10 minutes especially in the mornings during check out. Be sure to call ahead. Expensive! Try and get a rate that includes valet service. 3) Bathroom - pretty small and nothing pretty about it. just a standard hotel bathroom in their standard hotel room. Sink, vanity, toilet, and shower are all located in one room. Pretty tight accomodations. You pay for location here. This hotel does not have the luxury amenities and features equal to its price.

We telephoned ahead from Cabo as our flight was delayed for 3.5hrs and to let the hotel know that we would be late and to ensure that we still kept our reservation. On our arrival we were told by the female checking us in that they had no king size beds, this is despite the fact that I had telephoned approx 7hr prior from Mexico to advise of our late arrival. We were offered a double room as there were no king rooms left and when my husband explained he is too tall for a double bed we were moved into the disabled persons room (with a king bed) next to the elevator. At this time I asked that my husband and I have a room change the next day to a king size room. The next day we were moved to a room with a king size bed on the same floor. Housekeeping - the room was very clean, however for 2 out of four days we arrived back in our room in the late afternoon to find that housekeeping had not been. On each occasion we called housekeeping (or delighted to assist button on the phone) and were told they would send someone up straight away. We waited and waited and no one showed. Eventually on our third phone call over a 2 hr period, housekeeping eventually showed up. A message was left on our room phone message bank from the hotel advising they hoped our room had been cleaned and they wanted to ensure that our stay was special! The next day housekeeping knocked on our door and we said we will be 10 minutes and housekeeping said that would be fine and they would clean the room in 10 minutes. We left the room and arrived back 5 hours later and housekeeping had not touched the room. We called 'delighted to assist' and explained housekeeping had not been etc, the same thing had happened yesterday, they said sorry blah blah blah and someone would be up right away. 2 hours passed again before my husband called up twice more and housekeeping finally turned up at 4.10pm explaining to my husband they were not aware the room had to be cleaned earlier. Another downside, there is no laundry for clothes washing. The only alternative is dry cleaning through the hotel which is expensive. The reception/check in staff were not friendly (perhaps a reflection on the management) however the hotel did provide us with two beverage vouchers to the value of $16 each on our last day, however the same cannot be said for the restaurant staff at The Twist Restaurant at the hotel. The Twist Restaurant staff were friendly, helpful and ensured that all guests had everything they needed. We ate in the restaurant in the morning (The chilled buffet $16 is healthy and nutritious and delicious, American Buffet is $20) and the dinner menu is superb and the food delicious and fresh. Their wine list is excellent. The staff will chat to you and show an interest in you. We really appreciated their friendliness and kindness. The bellhops were really friendly and always ready to answer any questions we had. The concierge on the day we asked the gentleman a question, Tuesday 20th November was disinterested and unfriendly. The location of the hotel is great for all the tourist attractions in the area. Shopping is limited at Hollywood and Highland although there is a great DWS shoe store nearby. At nightime the area is questionable and sleazy at night and we would not recommend hanging around the boulevard for too long. It would not be a particularly safe place.

The room was clean & quite spacious & had everything you could really want for your stay. The view was as good as you will get in that location. Our room looked over Hollywood & the city of LA. We never had many dealings with the staff other than checking in & checking out of the hotel. We were only there 2 nights & to be honest we never encountered any problems with service. One major plus which was a surprise was the cost of onsite car parking. If I remeber correctly it was $20 a nights. Which was great value compared to the shock I got in San Fran at a rate of $50 a night. The hotel has a great location if you want to do the tourist stuff of Hollywood & surrounding area's. The hotel itself is built within an open air mall type area. You have some nice shops but the mall area contains mainly restauransts. All of this is situatated right on Hollywood Bvld & next door to the Kodak & the Chinese Theatre. The hotel swimming pool was on the small side & was empty most of the time. Not somewhere to go if you want to have a lazy holiday. We booked a city tour of LA & Hollywood via the hotel concierge. They were very helpful in pointing us in the right direction & who to avoid in booking these kind of trips. We ended up having a great day & took in some wonderful places within LA.

This was our 2nd time at this hotel and it will definitely not be our last. We love this hotel and hope it does not change unless it is to become even better. You just cannot beat the location that is pretty much central to everything. Hollywood just outside your door, L.A (we love to go to the farmers market and Grove) and Beverly Hills min. away, Santa Monica- We love to just hop on Sunset Blvd. to the PCH, Universal about 15 min, etc. and there's even a metro stop just outside the door though we always use the car. Though Disneyland and Knotts were not the sole purpose of our trip, we did go one day each for those and the car ride there was not far either. In the 2 times we have stayed there, I have not encountered bad service. On the contrary, it has been quite excellent. The hotel and room are clean. We requested a roll away bed and mini fridge, extra towels and pillows and all came at no extra charge. Before your visit, if you book through them, they even email you a \"request form\" that includes things like early check in, fridge, extra pillows, etc. There's a pool area, at the time we were there they were adding a spa. It might be complete now. The Hollywood and Highland complex which the hotel is connected to is always fun with the shops, places to eat, bowling, and more. During this visit, one day walked out of the hotel and to our surprise Michelle Phieffer's Hollywood Walk of Fame Star ceremony was starting so we were up front and center! Actor Paul Rudd and Jeff Bridges were there as well and Jeff Bridges even took my camera and took a picture of the both of us for me!

I'm writing a letter to the NW Marriott Regional Office at 1 Marriott Drive in Washington DC & another to corporate headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. For the rate we paid, things should have been top notch, I believe. There was no information in the rooms on local things to do & see, no one informed us of any perks (cocktails, snacks, ice machines, etc), the only fridge in the room charged you extra if you put anything in there (such as my grandsons medication) and would automatically charge if anything was removed (and not normal rate). The room service for a pint of ice cream and a slice of cake for $40.00. It blows me away that at the rate this hotel charges, the service and extras they try to get you for.

Check in was incredibly quick, taking literally 1 minute to complete, which was a blessing as we were meeting friends for dinner less than an hour later and were pretty stressed out after a long drive through rush hour traffic from the airport! The hotel sends an email in the week before your stay asking if you have any specific requests, and we had requested extra towels and a refridgerator in our room. The pleasant receptionist noted this and said that they would be delivered to our room promptly. They arrived less about 10 minutes later. The room was reasonably sized and very clean, the bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. Our view from the 14th floor was of the pool area and into the Hollywood and Highland Center was pleasant enough. The bathroom was good, if nothing special, but the water pressure was good and the bathroom amenities were nice and replenished daily. Unlike some hotels the hair dryer was also moveable, and I was able to take this into the bedroom to use the mirror there whilst my husband was using the bathroom. Housekeeping was good, but there is a notice in the bedroom that says they clean rooms between 9am and 5pm, which meant that often when we returned in the early afternoon the room had not yet been cleaned. Nevertheless, they were efficient and unobtrusive. One of my few complaints with the room was that it was not particularly well sound proofed (although I am quite particular about noise levels). I never heard a thing from outside, or from the rooms either side of us, but people in the corridors could be heard as clearly as if they were in the room itself! Not that it happened regularly or was lengthy, but I was awoken twice by such noise. The air conditioning was good although, again, too loud for me, so I did turn it off during the night. We didn't use many hotel facilities, and didn't eat there. We did eat at Wolfgang Puck's Vert in the shopping complex attached which had a lovely ambience, great service and good food. One thing we did use was valet parking. It may be $29 per day, but for the convenience, speed of service and pleasant staff it was perfect for us. We also used the minibar for bottles of water, when we ran out, and they cost around $2 per bottle, which in terms of hotel minibars, isn't that bad. The hotel always seemed busy during our stay, with many conventions or events going on. There were all sorts of different people from business men, regular tourists to women in amazing evening gowns in the lobby and as such the elevators were slow and sometimes crowded. Overall, the Renaissance Hollywood is a reasonably priced hotel with good amenities in a great location for tourists. As a tourist who was meeting friends that were staying at different hotels around Hollwood, I can honestly say it was perfectly placed and of a better standard than many of the other hotels around the area. Literally a minute's walk through the H&H complex and you are on Hollywood Boulevard and right by the Chinese theatre.

I was not dissuaded from this view after seeing the guest rooms and meeting facilities. I was very surprised to learn that the hotel was a renovated Holiday Inn. It seemed to me that every surface had been replaced, renewed, or reworked effectively obliterating every trace of its former incarnation. My room was comfortable and attractive with all new furniture, bedding and carpet. It is a nice set up for business travelers with a large repositionable desk and comfortable desk chair. Unfortunately like many upscale hotels they charge for internet access ($9.95 per day). The bathroom was average size but had a nice marble counter and massaging showerhead. Tub, tile and all fixtures appeared to be brand new. The hotel is large - more than 600 rooms - and seems to cater to conventioneers. There are three floors of meeting rooms and most of the folks I saw around the hotel seemed to be wearing name tags. I was surprised not to see more tourists during my stay as the hotel is near the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Grumman's Chinese Theater. The attractiveness and newness of the hotel was in stark contrast to the surrounding area. As you sit in one of the Eames chairs in the sleek lobby and look out the front window, you see a run-down strip mall with a liquor store, tobacco shop and \"JuJu's Brand Name Fashions for Less\" as tenants. In fact, with the exception of the Highland/Hollywood shopping center next door, the area surrounding the hotel is primarily tacky souvenir shops and low rise apartments/\"residence hotels\" dating from the 1940s/50s. The Highland Hollywood block includes the hotel, the new Kodak Theater (home to the Academy Awards) and the attractive open-air Hollywood Highland retail/dinning complex. Unfortunately this new construction was not an impetus for any new development nearby and outside this one block, the area is very run-down. To be clear, the area is not blighted - we are not talking about abandoned buildings or broken glass - just tired, old, scruffy buildings. I did encounter homeless people sleeping on Hollywood Blvd, only a few hundred feet from the hotel. Dining options are limited. There is only one restaurant in the hotel - Twist - which is open for all meals. I had breakfast there and it was tasty but fairly expensive at $20 for the buffet or $12 for a simple quesadilla. The restaurants in the Highland/Hollywood center are primarily chains and fast food with the except of Wolfgang Puck's Vert. For a fine dining meal, you will have to travel a considerable distance. I stayed at the Hollywood Renaissance in mid-July 2007 for three nights in order to attend a business conference at the hotel. I paid $169 which was the negotiated conference rate. I thought the hotel to be a great value at this price. My interaction with the staff was minimal - check in was quick and easy, maid was pleasant, and waiter was cheerful. I was concerned that I was never notified that I had received a FedEx package. If the sender had not contacted me, prompting me to inquire with the concierge, I would have left the hotel without getting the package.", "Date": "July 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cIn the Middle of All of the Action\u201d", "Author": "AustinTexan", "ReviewID": "UR8183636", "Content": "My wife and I, and our three children, spent two nights in the Renaissance Hollywood hotel (July 1st and 2nd).

The taxis are stupidly expensive so after spending $90 on the first day we decided to take the buses!! You get a day bus pass for $3 from the driver and can go all over the city they are clean and frequent every bus that we travelled on had a map and I found the drivers and and people friendly no problem even when we travelled at night. Universal Studios is only 1 stop by metro from this hotel but other than that the metro is pretty useless for tourist sights which is a shame I was expecting more. This hotel is very nicely done free water and room service and cleaning you could not complain about I would recomend as a foreign visitor not to expect to change money in the hotel they only allow you to change $100 a day and in a place like this money is spent fast so bring plenty. Outside the shopping centre there is a starline tour booth we did the stars home tour with beverly hills as we were deciding to do the tour the price dropped by $10 each so I recommend hesitating and seeing how much they are willing to take off. One more recommendation is Mels diner across the road turn away from the roosevelt and its your 1st right great food and not over priced unlike most places. I can not compain at all about this hotel but If I was to go again I would definantly stay in Santa Monica and travel into the sights by bus or car it is a lot cleaner safer and the restaurants are nicer too.

It was a \"working vacation\" as I was attending a songwriters conference. Yes, indeed the Renaissance is \"hip\" happening and abounds in just amazing modern art everywhere! The lobby bar is pretty nifty, and they have complimentary lemon water that was very refreshing on a hot day. My room overlooked the pool and shops of the nearby shopping complex. The lucky ones get a view of the Hollywood sign. The guest rooms have an brightly colored \"Austin Powers-esque\" decor scheme that while some may find exciting, I found it somewhat gaudy...but then I prefer my hotels on the \"homier/cozy\" side...and to me \"mod\" is simply not cozy. Because there are so many people around, I found the hotel to be somewhat noisy at times. The hotel's strength? Customer service. The staff was ready, willing and able to answer even the dumbest questions with friendliness and professionalness. I found the staff people very helpful...and despite the fact there were well known celebrity guests present, they treated everyone as a VIP. Now what I wasn't prepared for was that they add a $50 incidentals fee when they freeze your card, so plan ahead. It is removed from the bill if you don't use any incidentals, though...but still...a person ought to be warned when they book a room of that extra amount. The hotel's weakness? Housekeeping was not as meticulous as I thought it would be for a hotel of its caliber. At any given time there would be room service plates on the floors and I thought that was tacky looking for a hotel of this calibre. I had to call housekeeping to do my room on the 3rd day because they skipped it almost two days in a row and I had NOT put up any do not disturb signs, so i don't know why my room was ignored. While the hotel does have provisions for families, it is my opinion that this hotel is set up primarily for business travelers and those 20-something tourists or aspiring entertainers who want to experience the Hollywood \"scene.\" The only reason I would return here again would be because it is geographically convenient and in a reasonably safe neighborhood compared to other parts of Hollywood.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NOCA", "Title": "\u201cExpensive, large, self-contained and busy!\u201d", "Author": "Tynkility", "ReviewID": "UR7472347", "Content": "Things to like - This is a beautiful property. It's right in the heart of hollywood: Chinese theatre, walk of stars, theatres, clubs, etc. It's connected to the Highlands, basically an outdoor mall with many shops and restaurants. You can actually go to Grauman's to catch a movie, because the hotel exits into the courtyard of the complex on several levels. This is a Marriott property, so the beds are great, the rooms spacious (including the bathroom), the service is good and it's clean top to bottom. There are a couple of restaurant/bars in the hotel itself, and the \"scene\" is pretty good. Being a large hotel, there are constantly taxis available and the valets are pretty quick retrieving the cars. Rooms facing east have a view of the Hollywood Hills/Sign. It's also about 5-10min from Universal City Things not so crazy about - Though this is a higher end Marriott property, in my opinion it is way overpriced. You're basically paying for a safe above-average place, in a prime location. I received a group discount of $100, and the price was $189. So basically the rack rate is $290. I compare this to the Hilton I stayed at in the middle of TimesSquare, which was $250. If the room included a fridge, microwave and free internet, I might be less inclined to think such, but there was only an honor bar and internet was $.30@minute - 3 minute minimum. Valet is $29@night. There are 6 elevators which seem to be in use constantly, so I found a little annoying that there was no stair option. I was only on the fourth floor, but all of the stairways were emergency exit only. I didn't see very many children or families - though I was in panels most of the day - I think it's an ideal property for couples. Overall, if you can afford it, and want to be in the thick of hollywood, I recommend this hotel. But there are less expensive alternatives nearby. One tip though, if you're leaving the hotel and heading west, get a map to get familiar with the streets, and AVOID Hollywood Blvd for a few blocks (unless that's your destination, in which case you should just walk from the hotel).", "Date": "April 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cFun Hollywood hotel\u201d", "Author": "moondust7", "ReviewID": "UR7390190", "Content": "The Renaissance Hollywood Hotel is an excellent place to stay.

I had room service for breakfast 2 mornings - the lemon souffle pancakes and the cinnamon roll french toast were tastey. The prices were what you would usually pay for room service - about $15 total.

The drive from LAX to the hotel was interesting to say the least. It was my first time in LA (although not the States) and I couldn\u2019t get over the time it takes to get anywhere by car. The hotel is in one of the best locations in LA if you want to be based around Hollywood. The hotel is part of a huge complex, which includes a shopping mall and restaurants and opens right out onto the Hollywood Boulevard. One exit actually takes you down onto the Chinese Theatre forecourt where you\u2019ll find sight seeing trips and film stars handprints in concrete. There are also countless impersonators hoping for you to have your picture taken with them for a few bucks. One evening we listened to a Nirvana tribute band playing on the boulevard. Whoever they were they kept us entertained for half an hour with a good rendition of Seattle\u2019s finest. All this is within 5 minutes walk from the hotel reception. The hotel itself is nothing special but it is a nice modern well-run hotel with comfortable rooms and a great pool area. The only criticism I would make is that the internal design seems a little bland, especially in the lobby bar area. But hey it\u2019s no big deal. The hotel is also about 5 minutes drive from one of the freeways, which means it\u2019s easy to get out to the sights of LA even if it takes a while to get there. We had a room looking out the side of the Hotel directly onto the hills and the Hollywood sign \u2013 fabulous!

Tips from previous reviews on this website allowed me to get an unbelievable rate using a promo code, and info on 'club level access'. Shortly after I booked online, I received an email from Marriott confirming my reservation and asked for any additional requests. I then requested 2 double beds, a fridge, extra pillows, a room on the highest possible floor with a view of the Hollywood sign, and club level access for an additional $30/night. We arrived on Sunday afternoon at 2pm. Upon arrival, the doormen/valets eagerly helped us with our luggage and led us to the registration desk. The desk informed us that we did get a room on the 19th floor w/ a view of the Hollywood sign, but it would not be ready for another hour. They gladly stored our luggage and gave us information on the shopping complex next door. The Hollywood&Highland complex is pure fun for first time visitors to Hollywood -- Walk of Fame, the El Capitan, street vendors, Batman/Wonder Woman/Capt Jack Sparrow and other characters all at your doorstep -- made our 1 hour wait quite entertaining. While the hotel lobby and public areas are furnished in modern leather furniture which can be found in any department store, I was truly disappointed by the room itself. The brightly upholstered furniture and bed covers screamed cheap 10-year old Ikea and the moveable desk straight out of Staples. Also, while the pictures on the website showed floor-to-ceiling windows, our 19th floor windows were large but only half the height. Also, I didn't like that the lights in the room were very bright and your only option for a 'night light' is to prop the bathroom door open. The bathroom was also quite small. This is not what I would expect for a hotel which normally charges over $250/night (even if I paid much less). However, this is only MY opinion. Our room did have a great view of the Hollywood sign, so I did not complain. My husband and 2 kids didn't mind or notice the furnishings and lighting and found them more than acceptable. The best part of our stay was the club level lounge, which happened to be 2 doors down from our room. My kids and husband found a variety of hors d'oeuvres and drinks served at the lounge shortly after 6pm that evening, and desserts and coffee served until late that night. In the morning, coffee, fresh juices, huge buffet breakfast and several newspapers (LA Times, NY Times, USA Today) were available for us to enjoy while we watched the morning news. Also, bottled water, soda and juices were available for us throughout the day. My kids were in the lounge constantly, and the staff was always friendly and accommodating. It made the hotel feel like home for only an additional $30/night, which is a fantastic deal for a family of 4 with hungry, growing children. You'll never have to wait long for an elevator at this hotel, as they are very fast. The service we experienced during our stay was stellar -- in addition to everything I already asked for, I called for extra robes and toiletries and received them promptly. There was a computer and printer designated for boarding passes at the concierge desk that we could use for no extra charge. The doormen, staff at the concierge, check-in and especially the club lounge were always very friendly and helpful. We got a great deal at this hotel, and it was great introduction to Los Angeles and Hollywood.

This time the hotel has been rebuilt and is now the Renaissance with the Holiday Inn moving further up the road. As yo may know all hotel rooms in the USA have a copy of the bible. It seems the Marriott chain also carry a management book from their founder. It came as a surprise to me that of the 2000 plus hotels in the Marriott group, they actually only own about 20 or so hotels. They actually run hotels on a long lease. You can be sure that they know how to manage a hotel. The check in was a breeze and there was a genuine welcome. I was given a city view but I requested a view of the Hollywood sign and I got that without a problem. In fact my room also had a city view as well. The downside is that as it was an anniversary trip (and I am also a Marriott reward member) I got no offer of an upgrade or flowers or chocolates for my partner which was disappointing. The room was wonderful, modern and spacious. The bathroom was nice. The only strange thing was locating the safe which is located below the mini bar. The bell boy was very friendly and he not only suggested places to visit, but places to eat for breakfast as well as calling for a complimentary fridge so we could store our own food and drinks. Special mention must also go to the Concierge who was eager to help and assist. We wanted to take a bus to the Beverley Centre, and he downloaded the route and the numbered buses to take. It may not mean much to other people but just think of the amount of time where you are just given a leaflet at other hotels and told to go away. We had buffet breakfast at the hotel on several occasions. The range and quality was excellent. At $18 per head it was expensive. The restaurant service was good and attentive. As the weather was hot we used the pool everyday. I do believe it was heated because it was still warm in the evening. You can have good views of the H&H complex from the pool level and the Hollywood hills. I did think the pool's shape could be better. It could look crowded very easily with just a few people in the pool and I wished it was just had a rectangular shaped. They also needed to make sure that the towels were replenished during the late afternoons. They also had a good gym which was rather busy. The hotel tries to cover a lot of bases which it does very well. Its a family hotel for people on vacation, to a business hotel holding conferences to people having functions such as private parties and weddings. If there were negative points it was the valet parking attendants. Anyone entering the hotel forecourt were being moved on by the parking attendants rather brusquely even if they were just dropping or picking people up. The attendants are franchised to an outside company. If I have a friend picking me up (and remember I am a paying guest of the hotel) I do not one the attendant harassing my friend to move on. Remember we have visited from the UK to meet up with them. By the same token you can go to the H&H complex via the swimming pool level. There are security guards about who prevent shoppers from the complex to enter hotel premises. What I found strange that the security guard stopped me and another guest from walking the grounds just outside the hotel because he claimed it was the property of another restaurant. All we tried to do was take photographs of the view (there is a vantage point at another level but is crowded with tourists visiting the H&H complex) and we showed our key passes as proof that we were guests of the hotel. Its this type of pettiness that the hotel needs to look into and improve. Overall this is the best hotel you can stay at if you want to stay in Hollywood area. Its advantage is that it is part of the H&H complex. There is shopping nearby, food courts, bus stops, the metro station as well as lot of the other Hollywood attractions.

This was a night out with a bunch of friends partying in hollywood, after the night out, we come back to our room around 2-3am in the morning only to discover that the staff had changed my room without my direct permission! Our room key no longer worked and when I seeked assistance from the front desk, they informed me that MY room with all of my personal belongings is showing as vacant, meaning they could have checked in someone else in that room and I would have been out of luck. I was not happy about the situation and the on shift manager did not handle the situation well at all. He did not apologize, rather he was putting me at fault of the entire situation.

There was a lot of sitting space between the divan, sofa, end chairs and desk chair. The room smelled a little stale and there were oily face smudges marring the otherwise impressive windows looking out onto the Hollywood sign, Magic Castle, and Yamashiro restaurant. I called housekeeping to ask for extra towels which took at least 5 hours to be delivered! I also asked that the smudges on the windows be cleaned and they eventually were. The bathroom was really spacious with a nice vanity area and separate toilet and shower. I wish there were 2 sinks instead of one. Nice LATHER toiletries. The 2 waffle robes were a nice touch and reminded me of my stays at the JW Marriott. The king size bed was more than adequate although there was a smell (feathers) coming from the comforter.

Quickly checked in around 11:30 PM and confirmed an earlier requested non-smoking king bed w/rollaway bed. We were given a room on the 16th floor, but it did not have the extra bed. When the bell desk brought up our luggage a few minutes later, I mentioned the rollaway bed and the polite young man said he would take care of that for us. I also mentioned that we had requested a refrigerator online. He said he would take care of that too. Within a few minutes both the extra bed and refrigerator were delivered to our room! The next morning the room darkening blinds and shades were lifted to reveal a perfect view of the famous Hollywood sign! I didn't want to pay a zillion bucks for a hotel breakfast, and we hadn't yet signed up for the \"Club Level access\" (more on that later) so we ate at \"Mel's Diner\" around the corner. Great food and very reasonable prices at Mel's! In fact, we ate there two more times for lunch and dinner during our stay. We poked around the immediate area and saw Grauman's Chinese Theatre with all the hand/footprints of the stars, saw the Hollywood walk of fame, went into a few souvenir shops, and explored the multi-level shopping complex attached to the hotel. We ate at Johnny Rockets for lunch (also decent food and reasonably priced for a touristy area). Back at the hotel I inquired at the front desk about the \"Club Level\" access. For $30 more per day, you can get a continental breakfast in the morning...hors douvres in the late afternoon/early evening...and desserts around 7:30pm. Only guests with \"Club Level\" privleges can access the 19th floor (via a card slot in the elevator) and the associated \"Club Level room. The hotel upgraded my room key and we went upstairs to check it out. It was too early for \"free eats\" but the \"Club Level\" room (also acessed via a card slot) has a larger TV, newspapers, magazines, sitting area, and a fridge full of various sodas and bottled water. I went back down to the front desk to sign up for a day of hi-speed internet access at $10 per 24 hours (noon to noon). You can sign up online or in room for internet access for your entire visit, but I only wanted one day's access. They also have some type of Intenet keyboard access via the TV for those without a laptop. After a jet-lag induced nap for me, we went back to the club level for the hors douvres. They had chicken skewers, coconut shrimp, fruits/veggies/dips/nuts and cheeses. Not bad! Later that evening they had assorted pastries for dessert. The room was darkened and lit with candles for effect. The next morning we had the club level breakfast which consisted of bagels/breads/english muffins, fruits, yogurt, assorted cereals, tea, coffee, danish. muffind, etc. They also had a hot dish which was normally some type of scrambled egg ( rotated each day to including western omelet, egg quesadilla, soggy omelet \"mcmuffins\") All in all, I felt the \"Club Level\" access was well worth the $30 daily room charge (especially for a family) considering the decent breakfast selection and other food and beverage choices. Afther breakfast we were kind of in a hurry to get to Universal Studios. We had booked the Universal Studios Hollywood VIP Experience and our reservation was for 10:45. For some reason, I couldn't open the safe in our room, so I called guest services and they sent security to our room within a minutes or two ( I told them we were running late)! The security guy was very pleasant and helpful! The LA Metro is right next door to the hotel and Universal Studios is only one stop away. Very convenient! When we got back from Universal Studios around 8:45pm, we went to the Club Level for dessert. Unfortunately, all the dessert was gone and there were just a few people there watching the end of American Idol on the TV in the room. One of the people watching happened to be one of the America Idol contestants. It was Chris Daughtry! He was very nice and posed for a pic with us! The next day we did the \"Movie Star's Home Tour\" with Starline Tours. I was less than impressed, but my wife seemed to like it. I can't compare the tour to other tour companies, but our tour guide, Brian was fun and informative. Don't pay full price, though. When we were solicited to take the tour, the price dropped by $5 per person while we \"thought\" about taking the tour.

The hotel itself is nice -- I liked the modern decor, but there were too many issues to give it an \"excellent\". I felt that the service and the on site amenities were average, but because of the location and decor I decided to go with \"above average\" We spent 8 nights at the Renaissance. We booked a 1 bedroom suite with an adjoining double for our family of 5. The layout worked out well for us. We had a view that overlooked the mechanical stuff on the roof and then beyond that the adjacent mall area. It was fine for us -- we really weren't planning on much of a view at this location. We arrived at the hotel about a 1/2 an hour after their check in time. We were told that our double room was ready but that the adjoining suite was occupied and that they had given the person in the suite a late check out time of 6 pm. I was furious. I had called during a layover on our flight, confirmed our room, confirmed the adjoining room and confirmed that we would be arriving right on time and really wanted to be sure our room was ready. Don't know what happened. After asking to speak to a supervisor we were \"moved\" to a different room. Why they couldn't have put us in that one at first, I don't know. I did not request a specific floor or view. It was a frustration that I could've done without after a long travel-day. I was surprised to find that there was no wireless capabilities in the room. We had to connect to the internet using an ethernet cable and it was a bit inconvenient just because we're used to wireless. They have wireless in the lobby, I believe. We used our laptop a lot, though, for planning our days. They do have a business center, but you have to pay for use of the computer. One of our phones would not work (of course, the main one on the desk in the suite). I never did get that fixed -- you'd think that in a week they could've figured that out. One of our tv's was fuzzy and no one could figure that out. The friendliest people in the hotel are the valets. Overall they did a great job. The did \"lose\" my rental car one time, but cut my valet charges in half for the inconvenience. They were obviously embarrassed and offered to drive us where we were going. The housekeeping staff was marginal. It seemed like every day they forgot to replenish items and I'd have to call. No coffee for the coffee pot, only one wash cloth, what happened to that extra blanket, etc? Since we were there for a week, we really lived out of the room and it was a pain to always have to call for glasses, or refills for the mini-bar. It was the weirdest thing. We used the mini-bar quite a bit and I had to ask several times to have it replenished. I would have thought that they would have been thrilled to keep stocking it. I read a report from someone else about a dark mark on his clean sheets and that a hotel like this should not have that happen -- we had it happen too. Ours looked like a coffee stain. The location is very good. It was a central location for our itinerary and getting around was easy. There is always something to see at Hollywood & Highland. We really enjoyed just walking around and people-watching. It was not great weather while we were there, but the kids wanted to swim anyway and I think that in good weather, the pool would be awesome. Definitely a plus of the hotel. The adjacent mall was just so-so for us. Our opinion could be because we have 3 boys. A mall doesn't work for them if it doesn't have a Foot Locker, some type of hat store, and/or a sporting goods store. The stores that it did have didn't really appeal to them, so they were really interested in spending time walking around the mall. But, it did have some great food selections and a Starbucks. I would recommend the Grill restaurant. Very good. If we return to this area again, I would probably not stay here again.

I enjoyed my stay, but for the first time at this hotel, I had several disappointments. I was there for 5 nights for both business and leisure. I stayed in a one bedroom suite on the thirteenth floor facing \"southish\" so I had a view of the city instead of the Hollywood Hills this time. The view was okay (the roof of the Kodak Theatre was right in front of me, though) and I missed seeing the Hollywood sign from my room, so I asked immediately if I could move. Even though the hotel was quite empty (compared to my prior two visits) they could not accomodate my request. That isn't that big of a deal, but I don't think the staff really tried. Also, I requested a refrigerator in my room online two days before I arrived and it wasn't there upon my arrival (another reason I felt like asking for another room). It took me three calls to the front desk to get one in my room after that! I also had to make more than one request for extra soap and towels. Immediately upon my arrival I noticed a light bulb out in my bathroom. It was quickly replaced, but you think whoever prepped the room for arrival would have noticed it. Also there was gum stuck in the bedroom carpet, which was also quickly cleaned up after I reported it. Also, the housekeeping staff varies in capability at this hotel. I tipped the same everyday, so I know that wasn't it. But on my last day the housekeeper took off the extra blanket I had put on the bed and left the heavy comforter wadded up on the floor. That night I also noticed gray marks on the edges of my bed sheets. I was too tired to report it and wait for the bed to be remaid, so I just went to sleep. I don't think the sheets were dirty, but worn sheets like that should not be put on a bed in a hotel like the Renaissance Hollywood. The housekeeper had to have noticed the marks. I valet parked everyday, which is the most convienient thing to do here. However, I ended up being charged $24 dollars a day instead of the $22 quoted. Not a big deal, but I hate suprises. The valet staff and bell-hops are extremely friendly at this hotel, unlike some of the staff at front desk. Not that anybody at the front desk was rude, just less friendly. And the concierge staff is even less friendly than they are. I think if they just think you are a tourist, they treat you a little less nice. Also, the food at the hotel is average. Whoever raves about the room service at this place must work for the hotel. It is simply ok. If you want to eat closeby you will fare better in the Hollywood and Highland Courtyard. There are good restaurants there both expensive and moderately priced. And lots of fast food choices out there also. I will stay here again because the location is EXCELLENT.

Tripadvisor was the main reason for choosing this hotel and it did not disappoint. First of all, by the official rates it is not a cheap place to stay but you will probably be able to do what we did and get a really good deal. Marriott have a \"look no further\" price guarantee where they will beat any other room rate assuming you've already made the booking direct on the Marriott website. It is not too difficult to find a far better rate at one of the travel sites and this is what I did. You have to send a screenshot as proof but I ended up getting a 60% discount on the published rate which I was very happy with. However there was a mixup, when they applied our discount they also erased all the requests on the room type/beds/smoking etc. Luckily I spotted this a few days before departing and I must say that Marriott customer services were really excellent in getting the problem sorted out. Just be aware... So we arrived at the hotel and I'm glad that I read someone else's review because you definitely should just park at the front, check in, drop your bags off and then move the car. The car park is a little inconvenient from the hotel but we got used to it and it is absolutely HUGE with spaces always available. The 17th floor room was superb, just as expected. We were on the north side of the hotel which overlooks the hills and the Hollywood sign and it is quite a sight to wake up to. The decor and bedding were in excellent condition. We used the high speed internet access which worked great. Beds are REALLY comfortable and big which gave me a great night's sleep. Bathroom is just the same as you'd find in any hotel of this class, nothing more, nothing less. We went to breakfast in the hotel for 2 or 3 times just out of convenience. It is expensive but good. Service was not very attentive though. One morning the waiter admitted that he couldn't find our bill and kinda shrugged his shoulders! Of course when I checked the bill at the end of our stay, he had managed to find it after all. Funny that! In the adjoining mall there are several restaurants (Burgers, Italian, Pizza) which we went to in the evenings, these were fine for what they are. As you'd expect the area is touristy which isn't really my thing, at night outside the mall there isn't really that much to do so you'd probably want to drive to another part of town. So to sum up, a very slick and comfortable hotel.

When checking in, the person who checked me in flat out lied to me. I asked her twice to confirm that it had two beds. Each time she said yes. When the bellhop opened the door to the room, it had one king bed. The bellhop called down to the front desk for me and they said I should check back in an hour or two. Unfortunately, when I did check back, I was told that the hotel was oversold and that there was no way I would get the room that had been reserved for me two to three months ago. I was there for three nights and staying with a friend, so we were both not happy. They said they could put a rollaway in the room, which didn't thrill either of us, but we accepted it. The person coordinating our trip then had the hotel give us access to the members floor, so we would be able to get free breakfasts, evening appetizers and evening desserts. When my friend and I arrived back from dinner. I saw housekeepers cleaning an empty room and asked them if any rooms with two beds were available. They said yes. I rushed to my room and called the front desk to ask for another room. They asked if I needed assistance, and I said yes. About 15 minutes later, someone knocked on our door with the keys, but he didn't seem thrilled about helping us move our luggage to the other room, so we did it ourselves. The reservation mix-up and lying about it was the worst part of my experience at the hotel. However, when I went back to the front desk in the morning to turn in the old keys and to have the member service added to the new keys, the same front desk person from the day before was back at the front desk and seemed shocked that I had the member service on my room keys. (I explained that it was added because of the room reservation fiasco. I'm guessing that she is either new or inadequately trained.) I brought out my Marriott member card at that point because I was irritated by her lying and lack of professionalism. On to the better parts of the hotel stay. The room itself was small, but nice. It's very modern in design and fresh looking. It features wooden blinds, and a pull down shade, which is a nice departure from heavy curtains. It was very clean, and I never saw any stains, other than on our shower liner. The sheets were nice. The comforter was very heavy though, making it difficult to turn over in the middle of the night without waking. About the minibar...don't even lift a snack or you'll be charged! This was a new technique I've not seen before. Some others in my group in other rooms were afraid to even open the fridge for being charged. I was charged $1 to make a local call, so use your cell if you have one. The bathroom was light, bright and spacious. The shower curtain rod is curved, giving more shower room, which was nice. The bathroom toiletries are nice, very fresh and modern. The towels were thick, plush and clean. There's a large vanity top in the bathroom, which is nice for laying out toiletries. The housekeeping staff is friendly and excellent. The room itself is very, quiet, which was wonderful. I didn't swim, but I did check out the pool area, and it's very nice. It even features private cabanas. The workout room looked very nice, too. They are next to each other. The hotel location is fabulous. The hotel is connected to a huge complex of shopping and eating areas. It's also very close to Grauman's, the Kodak Theater, the Hollywood walk of stars, etc. I didn't take the Metro, but there's a Metro stop very near, too. It's centrally located to a lot of things. It took about 30-45 minutes to take Sunset Blvd. to the Getty Center during the morning. Parking is reasonably prices, but it's a bit of a hassle unless you do valet parking. The concierge staff is very nice and helpful, but they weren't always accurate on the directions. One of them told us wrong, and it cost us 10 very important minutes. Oh, about the member rewards room, the breakfasts are the best part. The evening appetizers are so-so, as are the desserts. However, the concierge staff there is extremely helpful and nice. Would I stay there again? Yes, depending on the price I could get. The location is great, and the room is very nice and QUIET.

Negative aspect: The parking situation is horrible. First, when you get into the garage you must find the elevators up. Upon reaching the third floor, you find you are in a shopping mall and must take your luggage through the mall to the side entrance of the hotel. You then must find and enter the elevator in the hotel(M level) and go down one floor to the lobby to register. You can then access your room via the same elevator you just left. Parking costs are as follows: $10 per day for no re-entry, $15 per day for unlimited re-entry, and $22 per day for valet (tips additional). I would recommend the valet service to save yourself A LOT of exercise (and don't forget something in your car or you will spend 15 minutes getting it). The pool, although we did not use it, was beautiful. Noise was not a problem except for the three gunshots we heard from a nearby nightclub shooting at 2:30 AM. Yes, the neighborhood is a bit risky. Tours: We made the mistake of taking the Starline tour of the Hollywood homes. First, the van seats 13 tourists plus driver. The windows are very low so you must slouch to see out. The person on the aisle seat sees next to nothing. Second, the stars want their privacy (understandable) so almost all homes are obscured by high gates and shrubs. This was a very long and back breaking 2 hours. My husband nicknamed it the front gate tour. Consider a limo tour before spending $35 pp on this one. Great breakfast spot: located on Highland Ave. between Hollywood Blvd and Hawthorn Ave is Mel's Diner. Reasonable and good and only a block walk from the hotel. Don't miss the Cold Stone in the mall for ice-cream. I also recommend the Warner Brothers VIP Studio Tour. The cost is $39 pp ($3 discount pp with AAA). Very interesting. We even had the pleasure of a conversation and pictures with Martin Sheen, a very gracious and entertaining man. Information Center: In the mall, next to the entrance to the Kodak Theater on the second floor is the information center. Great for maps and brochures. Pick up a map of the stars located on the Hollywood Walk-of-Fame for ease in finding your favorites if interested. This hotel is certainly one of the better ones in LA.

Thirdly there was no hot water in my shower, and 30 minutes later when it finally got luke warm i realised there was no fan in the bathroom and the door to the bathroom does not stay open! Its shuts automatically. So I was totally unimpressed witht the bathroom.

Valet service was lightening fast and pretty reasonable at $22, which was surprisingly cheap considering what we've paid in other metropolitan tourist areas. Front desk check in was quick and pleasant. The room itself was a typical king hotel room setup with bath, bed, tv/armoire, and desk. We had a view of the city which was very nice both at night and during the day. The decor is sort of retro, reminiscent of 50s contemporary styling. The bathroom was roomy with plenty of towels and bath products available. Everything was very clean and in good shape with the exception of the bedspread and pillow shams, which seemed a bit worn (not a big deal as we just throw it all off the bed when we sleep anyway). All the public areas are clean and have wonderful artwork on display. We had the breakfast buffet at Twist, the onsite restaurant and found it to have a good selection of quality hot & cold items, including cooked to order eggs and waffles. The service was top notch and we thought it was a pretty good value for $16 or so, even though we didn't eat a lot. All in all, this was a great hotel providing us the perfect home base for our one day visit to Hollywood. It is a great option for anyone looking to stay in or tour the Hollywood Boulevard attractions, as well as other attractions reachable by Metro as the station is extremely close by.", "Date": "September 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay as long as..\u201d", "Author": "Purpleguardog", "ReviewID": "UR3813741", "Content": "This is a great hotel to stay in Los Angeles, really convenient location, lovely decor, great valet service etc.etc. as long as you can deal with the unbelievably offhand reception staff.

She quickly checked me in to my room on the club floor, but it was only after I walked away that I realized that she did not give me any information on the club floor lounge (open 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.). The room had a nice view of the LA smog--downtown was barely visible, although the Hollywood sign could be seen off to the side. The room itself was clean and decorated in a style that is intended to be modern and hip. To me, however, it came across as austere and cold (although the room does include a fish in a small bowl so as to ensure that you have a friend away from home). The room and bathroom also seemed a tad smaller than typical, although they were certainly big enough, and the all-important bed was comfortable. Room service was fine, although the hallways were lined with dirty trays--one stayed outside my room the whole time I was there. As for the hotel's location, it can't be beat--the Kodak Center is just steps away, and virtually all of the sites of interest along Hollywood Blvd. are within a convenient walk.

The Renaissance is a new-build property, visible from several miles away, just up from the junction of Hollywood and Highland. It is actually part of the Hollywood & Highland complex, which is a 4-floor collection of small stores and restaurants. This is where the only negative comment I have about the location comes in - the parking. Parking your vehicle involves using the cavernous car park serving the shopping complex. You have to drive underground 3-4 levels and park up then make your way to the elevators or the escalators and make your way up again (with your luggage, of course) to the third level of the complex, then cross through the stores and enter the hotel (still at the third level) then take a hotel elevator down to the lobby, check-in, then back up in the elevator to your room...quite a trek! Seriously consider the valet, as I do now. Once you have recovered from the parking ordeal, you will quickly concede that the hotel is amazing. The views are spectacular. Either you get the Hollywood sign or the City of Los Angeles, either view is a winner. As several other people have commented here, the windows in the rooms are floor to ceiling and several nights I went to sleep with the curtains open so I could see the city spread out below. Beautiful. Bathrooms are large and have all the amenities you would expect. There is always plenty of closet space and the beds are wonderfully comfortable. Be careful of the mini-bar though - removing an item to even look at it seems to automatically charge it to your room! The pool area at this hotel is underrated also, a good sized swimming area, plenty sun loungers and several cabanas for those really hot days. The restaurant in the hotel I have not tried in the evening however the buffet breakfast is more than adequate - plenty choice of meats/ eggs served to order, cereals, pastries and fruit and currently $16 which is not so bad for the quality of the food and surroundings. As for surroundings, the immediate vicinity can be rather seedy at night although not unsafe. And the location is terrific - you could walk uphill to the Hollywood Bowl, the Hollywood Walk of Fame runs along the front of the shopping complex, the Kodak Theatre is actually part of the complex itself, Mann's Chinese Theatre is next door to the Kodak and the Hollywood Sign looks down on the hotel from the rear. Any negative points to this property? Just the parking - if you have trouble walking, it may be an issue. However bear in mind the hotel offers a rate of $15 a day with in-and-out privileges, whereas the carpark itself only offers $10 rate per entry with no in-and-out so book with the hotel, it should work out better for you.

There was toast, muffins, bagels, croissants, cereals, omletts made to suit you (lots of different fillings), fresh fruit, salmon, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and complimentary tea/ coffee and juice. It was nice weather but a bit too chilly for the pool - however, it was a nice area and would be great for the summer. The hotel connects to the Highland mall, which if you walk through, brings you right into the middle of Hollywood Boulevard and next to Graumanns Chinese Theatre. The mall itself is great, with a mixture of shops (picked up some great clothes there). Theres also loads of restaurants (we loved the Italian on the top floor) and jewellery stalls in the middle. We had Sandra Bullocks premiere of Miss Congeniality and watched her get her star on the walk of fame the next day - it was a great experience. The hotel really does have a fabulous location. L.A itself is an amazing city which has so much to offer. It's so cheap compared to the UK. I'd recommend a visit to Universal Studios where on the tour you get to see movie sets and T.V sets like Desperate Housewives. The Warner Bro's tour was also fab - got to see F.R.I.E.N.D.S set and watched Joey being filmed live (must book tickets in advance over Internet but they're free!). Venice Beach was beautiful and when we go back, we'll def, spend more time there. The people are some of the friendliest I've met and even though they see hundreds of tourists a day, they're just as happy to chat to you and give you as much enthusiasm as they did to people before you. That helps when you get as homesick as me. The hotel was 100% and we'll certainly be booking there again asap! :-)", "Date": "April 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "CincinnatiTravelgirl", "ReviewID": "UR3294671", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance Hotel Hollywood Feb. 19, 2005.

The rooms are good sized. I was in a king bed room with a view towards Downtown LA on the 10th floor. The design of the hotel is modern, but not to the extent where anything is too weird. The windows have wooden blinds and nice blackout shades. The linens on the bed could be softer, but the bed had 7 pillows. Since the hotel is relatively new, I expected more from the bathroom. It is nothing special. I had hoped for a separate water closet or even a separate bath/shower. Also, it is odd that the bathroom has no active fan so the mirror instantly fogs. The one vent in the shower doesn't do enough to exhaust the steam. It is important to note that the hotel and Hollywood & Highland in general are NOT in the best area. I've lived in Downtown and urban areas most of my life. The run-down buildings that surround the complex didn't bother me. However, I walked about seven blocks to the Pantages Theatre and saw my share of homeless, hookers, and many boarded up storefronts. Not everyone will fell comfortable walking off the complex.

The hotel is gorgeous, spacious rooms, a fabulous view of the Hollywood sign, comfy beds and well air-conditioned rooms. The staff were helpful and friendly (apart from the lady in the shop, she tried to short-change me in the shop, and she wouldn't listen to me. Took my mum to persuade her otherwise!), especially in the restaurant. Lovely food there, but a bit pricey and the menu isn't exactly varied. Although, there are lovely places in the Hollywood and Highland complex, which you can get into through a short walkway in the hotel. Some evenings there are VERY LOUD bands playing different music, and there is a very relaxed and safe atmosphere there at night unlike Hollyowwd 3 years ago when we never ventured out of the hotel after 8pm! The metro is about a 5 minute walk away from the hotel, and it's extremely cheap to get a train to Universal Studios, then it's just a short walk to a shuttle stop to get to the park. If you do decide to visit Universal, it may be worthwhile buying a queue-jumping ticket which allows you to get in the front of the line of every ride and show, and gives you reserved seats at all shows, although it may be worthwhile getting to shows a little while before it says to get there on the ticket, especially if it's a busy day. Although it's $50 more than a standard ticket, it's definately worth the money!!! Chinese Mann's Theatre is a short walk away, as is the Walk of Fame and the Kodak theatre. If you wish to visit the latter, visit the leaflet stand at the hotel, as there is a discount voucher there. When we went, it was a quite day so we got to sit in the chairs that celebrities sat in, and we also got to stand on the stage!

IT was modern and very unique. The room was very clean and looked very new. The bed was really really comfortable with more than enough pillows. I could have slept all day. I loved \"Twist\", breakfast was really good. You must try the smoothies. The enviornment is great for a weekend getaway. Lots of good places to eat nearby. My only complaint was that I wanted to take advantage of the free shoe shine. I called multiple times and they kept promising someone would pick up my shoes but then never came. I complained about this and got free drinks instead. Otherwise a great/hip hotel to spend the weekend at.

Metro is within a 2 minute walk and costs $1.25 each (please note that the machines only accept $1 and $5 bills). It takes about 5 minutes on the train.

Modern fun and funky decor. The entire Hollywood and Highland complex is a great edition to the Hollywood area. As a return visitor to LA what a change this area has undergone. Whilst it is an area clearly catering for tourists its a good location for a first timer to base themselves in spreadout LA. The rooms were huge and I had a great view of downtown LA and the Hollywood sign from the 19th floor. I nearly drowned in bath towels - so many were supplied in my bath room. My only complaint I couldnt store anything in the hotel fridge, if you took anything out of the mini bar you were charged. I like to have real milk in my coffee not the powdered stuff. So that was a bit of a pain. If you are into American Idol this is the place to be. The 12 days I was staying coincided with the American Idol finals and whilst I am not a fan of the show (wrong age bracket) if you are a fan you would have seen many of the Idol contestants and the judges coming in and out of the hotel. In fact if you are into doing the whole \"Hollywood\" thing celebrity spotting etc this is the hotel for you. The premiere of Raising Helen with Kate Hudson was across the road at the beautiful El Capitan theatre while I was staying. Transport has improved tenfold since my last visit with the Metro being built. There is a stop at Hollywood and Highland. Its one stop away from Universal Studios. I found it was a clean safe and easy way to get around. Apart from the non existent personality of the guy at check in, I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. (Maybe he was having a bad day or was rehearsing his starring role as Marcel Marceau!) A great place to stay in a good location.

It's 12.00 a day with in/out priv. versus the valet parking at 28.00 plus tip! The food is gteat at \"Twist\" and is worth the cost. There is, hoever a huge mall connected to the hotel and provised fine dining and fast food fare for those of us who are on a budget. FYI the pool area is cool but is NOT owned by the hotel. Wolfgang Puck owns it and rents it out for parties. While I was there the noise was so loud into the wee hours of the morning due to a HOOTERS convention. I was assured that this is not a regulat occurance and adfter a call to the front desk, it quieted down. Views of the city are great, vast, and plentyful with help of the panoramic windows in every roon..but beware they do not open so one is forced to breather dry, recycled air :) Guess thats a positive considering it LA!

The small food shops in the Mall had good mexican food and pizza and the coffee shop on the second floor was excellent. They also offer a great fruit salad. You can take a bus to the Farmers Market and Rodeo Drive and the LeBrea Tar Pits/ Art Museum. All in all - Burger King and McD's were short walks for Breakfast and the many unique characters at night made for a most entertaining stay.

I booked online through swa vactions so basically, it was about $200.00 cheaper than booking the flight/hotel separately. When we got there, I asked about upgrading to the executive suite since it has an \"oversized\" bathroom. They upgraded me for free (even after I said I would pay the difference). Our room was on the Hollywood Hills side (where you can see the Hollywood sign from your room). The reception group (bellmen, concierge, the entire staff) could not have been nicer. We are not rich by any means, and I'm sure the staff at the hotel could tell that, but they never looked down upon us. Some people have said some things about the service, but I can't complain at all. We tipped housekeeping $4.00 a night (I don't know how much you're supposed to tip - I usually just do $2.00, but since we had a bigger room...) Even then, I don't know if that's high, low, good enough??? We planned on going to Universal Studios, seeing Ryan Seacrest On-Air, and hoping to catch a glimpse of stars (The Whole Ten Yards premiere was at the Graumann's Chinese Theatre while we were there). If you go to see Ryan, get there by 7:30. We went 2 days and barely got in the first day (7:30 arrival in line). The next day, I got in line at 7:00 and was 6th in line (sat front row-make a creative sign and they'll sit you up front). Ok, back to the hotel. The bathroom in the executive suite is oversized, but basically, they just added a table along the opposite wall from the sink. The problem is this: I was hoping for 2 sinks - there was plenty of room for 2. Plus, I was hoping for a separate shower. Once again, there was plenty of room for this. This suite was definitely bigger than a regular room, but no big deal. In order to watch TV, you basically had to move the couch to be in front of it; otherwise, you had to watch it from an angle (from the bed or the couch). They had a chair that faced the TV, but if more than 1 person wants to watch TV, then this layout is useless. Still though, it was great, and in the end, the 2 sink thing and separate shower thing didn't bother me. This hotel is in an absolutely perfect location. We did not rent a car since we didn't need to go sightseeing outside of the area. Some people say you should rent a car, others say no need. If you don't mind spending $20.00 a day to park your car at the hotel plus the rental fees for the car, plus paying for parking many other places you go, then go ahead and rent a car. We ended up spending $100.00 total for a cab. The subway ($1.25 per person per trip or $3.50 per person all day) is 1 stop (5 minutes) away from Universal Studios - and it's not \"scary\" to ride. All in all, the money spent on this hotel was well worth it. We planned this trip perfectly. The Whole Ten Yards premiere was on 4/7/04 at the Graumann's Chinese Theatre (right by the hotel). We saw Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge, Amanda Peet, and many others. Matthew Perry even gave us his autograph. We also saw John Travolta and Uma Thurman shooting on the set of Be Cool (they were shooting in front of the Graumann's Theatre). Like I said before - PERFECT LOCATION.Pros: Many things are very very close by: The walk of fame Graumann's Chinese Theatre (where premieres are held) Kodak Theatre Numerous shops and restaurants (best eatery is Fresh Fire Kabobs - don't miss it!!!! Johnny Rocket's wasn't all that good. Metro Railway (subway) - goes to downtown LA, Universal, many other places - even within free shuttle distance of LAX (we used it for Universal only) Ryan Seacrest On-Air Cons: 1. Twist Restaurant at breakfast. We ate there on our last day - $16.00 each for the buffet (including drinks). Unfortunately, our waiter never came back to refill my OJ - he actually didn't show up again until he brought the check. He didn't care that we were there. We should have gone across the street to get donuts. 2. $40-$50 for the cab ride to/from the airport (LAX). This is true, of course, for anything since LA is 30 miles away from LAX. Burbank Airport is closer, so you might want to look into that airport.All in all, I give this 5 stars - You can't beat it. It is absolutely the best hotel I've stayed in (of course, it costs more than any other hotel I've been in). We don't stay in $60 hotels any more - they suck. I find hotels that cost $90 or more. This one is $200 a night. Well worth it. When I go back to Hollywood, I have no doubt where I'll stay.
