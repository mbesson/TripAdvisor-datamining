{"Reviews": [{"Content": "great location and comfortable room My wife and I was looking for a good not too pricey place in expensive Barcelona and we settled on las ramblas apartments bed and breakfast.The place is right on the Ramblas with a few minute walk to the market. So it's a perfect location.The room was clean with a double bed (not two twins pushed together like many other places) and a clean private bathroom. The place also has a kitchen that you can use if you want to cook and save some money. A big bonus was that although the place is right on las ramblas the rooms don't face the street so it's a quiet stay.For the price and location you can't go wrong.", "Date": "Oct 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR998379934", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "galf81"}, {"Content": "Great alternative for families Stayed at Las Ramblas I Apartements during a family vacation. We loved it! Felt like being in our own house. There is even a supermarket closeby, which was nice because we were able to cook a few meals during our stay.The apartments are clean, quiet, and VERY close to Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter. Although we had been told that Barcelona\u9e93s public transportation was easy to use, we ended up walking everywhere as sights were so close to the apartments!", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR279911317", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ab200868"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1141159-r21211181-Las_Ramblas_Apartments_I-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "1141159", "Price": "$250"}}
