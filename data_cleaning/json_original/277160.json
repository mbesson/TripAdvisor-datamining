The main issue here is the popularity of the hotel with school trips as one group leaves, another arrives. The group that arrived on our second night seemd to take over the whole floor, with constant running up and down corridors at all hours, in and out of each others rooms all made worse due to the extremely poor sound proofing of the rooms. We even had to unplug our phone as it kept ringing during the night. We did try and cut them some slack due to first night excitement, however this continued the following night. The hotel also is on a main road, which at first instance doesnt seem that busy, but if your room faces the road, with the poor windows you do feel that you are sleeping oposite the M6. We did hope to mention these issues when checking out, but the rude staff member on the desk at the time did not even have the coutesy to ask if we enjoyed our stay, he just groaned when we did not have cash to pay the tourist tax (3 euros per person per night) whilst being more concerned about dealing with some italian guests who were in reception at the same time. Breakfast is again basic, processed ham and cheese to go with some bread rolls, along with criossants and a selction of biscuits and jams. The orange juice is out of a machine, and the coffee is not very good. The hotel is at the top end of the metro, and about a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest station (be aware that until next year the A line you need to travel on has restrictions from Sunday-Friday and only runs until 9pm, when a bus service takesover), and does take you through a residential area close to the hotel and some shops further up by the metro station.

What they do not tell you is that they are home to school trips which bring 50 Italian teenagers shouting and screaming down the corridor until early hours. We also had an incident where they were walking into our room! Of course I complained, the night porter tried to help and told me to write a letter of complaint on their headed paper.

The shower in the bathroom was OK - definitely the best (only good?) thing about this hotel. The maid service was good - well, standard really but still stood out in a hotel like this. The rooms were noisy and sounds from the rest of the corridor spread very easily - as did the noise from the main road outside which our room overlooked. The breakfast was rubbish. I didn't expect much from a continental buffet but the bread rolls were rock hard, the ham was that nasty 99% water processed stuff that I wouldn't even give to my cat, the coffee was from a machine and undrinkable - basically, italians should have been ashamed to serve it! However, I doubt the staff cared if their attitude towards showing people to a table (which didn't happen) or clearing dirty plates/cups from used tables (which only happened when I asked them to as there was no where else to sit) is anything to go by. The staff at the front desk were rude, almost immediately on arrival. This continued throughout the stay. On our final day, we were given a key to a luggage room to store our bags before our flight that evening. I may have been at fault as I took the key with us as I didn't know it was the only one. When we got back to the hotel to colect our bags, the man on reception actually yelled at me. Even if I was at fault, that reaction was totally unacceptable. The hotel is only 10 mins away from the centre of town and a 5 min walk from the Metro stop so this wasn't as bad as I had been expecting. The area is quite rough and I don't think a group of girls would feel safe walking back late at night alone. All in all, don't do it!", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cConvenient for Metro\u201d", "Author": "Wedderburn", "ReviewID": "UR96745898", "Content": "This hotel was booked as part of a budget package, which was exceptional value.

We booked a transfer from Leonardo DiVinchi Airport to the hotel which took about 20 minutes in fairly heavy traffic. We arrived at the hotel at 11:30am - before the checking in time of 2pm- but this wasn't a problem. We were checked in straight away, given some information about the area and a tourist map of Rome and then went straight to our room. The receptionist was very friendly and extremely helpful. His English was excellent. There are two lifts in the hotel which are a little dated, but functioned fine and were quick to call. Our room was on the 5th floor and was spacious and clean. The double bed was actually two singles pushed together so it was very spacious. Unfortunately the beds were a little hard for my liking and there was only one pillow each, with no spare. However, when our room was made up on the first morning the maid supplied us with extra pillows after noticing we had folded the extra blankets under the pillows on the bed. The heating is individually controlled in each room which was good on the colder nights and the bathroom was clean and functional. The location of the hotel was fine. It is a 10 minute walk to the nearest underground station, but it was very easy to find and most days I found I was at the station before I realised it! We bought out tickets from the newsagent across the road from the hotel - who spoke English very well. There is also a ticket machine at the station which costs the same (11Euros for a 3 day pass). Once on the metro train you are only 5 minutes from the first of the tourist destinations. The hotel was used by many coach tours during our stay (probably due to it's large car park) but the restaurant was large enough to cope with this and the food on the buffet breakfast was constantly restocked. Some people have said that there wasn't enough choice, but to be honest, I usually only have toast for breakfast at home, so having similar things each day didn't bother me. The breakfast was similar to all of the other 4 star hotels I have stayed at in Europe. Overall we really enjoyed our stay in Rome. The friendlyness and willingness to help of the staff at this hotel was second to none and with a little decor update, this could be an excellent hotel.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant 10 nights\u201d", "Author": "Cracker_Chris", "ReviewID": "UR73092842", "Content": "A friend and I stayed at this hotel for 10 nights in July-August 2010. After reading many of the reviews on this site, I was very worried we made a terrible decision. The worrying was needless however, as the hotel was excellent. I'll break this review down into simple parts. Location Granted, the hotel is a fair distance away from both airports and the port, and a few miles from central Rome. The latter is pretty much a null point however, as the hotel is close to a major road which has buses going into and out of the centre pretty much every 5-10 mins. The hotel is also a 5-10 minute walk from the Cornelia Met.Ro station. The walk to the Met.Ro is quite pleasant (although there are open bins along the route, which sometimes smell). Some people have complained over this, but the bins disappear when you head out of the residential area and onto the main road (leading to the Met.Ro station) which is lined with shops and stalls. Overall I was pleased with the location of the hotel. Some people have suggested that it was \"too far\" from central Rome. This is nonsense. The Cornelia Met.Ro station is 4 stops from the Vatican (10 minutes) and around 9 to Termini (25 minutes). Rooms Our room was initially one with a double bed but we discovered these were 2 single beds placed together. As this is what we needed, we simple pulled them apart and had 2 singles. The room itself was clean and tidy, with no visible problems which were pointed out in earlier reviews. The bathroom was clean and the shower was pleasant in the mornings. Staff The staff at the hotel have been nothing but friendly and kind the whole time we were here. They'd happily fill any request we asked for, and spoke English very well. Not once did they ask us to repeat what we said. We also made an effort to use some Italian words, which we noticed were very well received. The room cleaning staff were also prompt and our room was always remade by the time we came back at around 4pm. The waiters in the restaurant downstairs in the mornings were also prompt at changing table sheets but didn't appear to know much English. Facilities The hotel has lifts which are quick and we didn't have any problems with them (an earlier reviewer critised them, no idea why). The hotel also has a bar down in the lounge which opens at 7:30pm. We found it to be a little expensive, but it's good for sitting down with a drink after a day in Rome to talk about what you'd done that day. The hotel also has 2 desktop PC's which you can use free of charge for word processing, but for the internet there is a small charge (e.g. 5 euros for 2hrs). They also offer a WiFi service for the same prices. I did try using the WiFi service in our hotel room but apparently it only allows login downstairs (even though there was a router right outside of our hotel room). It was slightly inconvient but nothing I was too annoyed with. I'd imagine you'd have better success logging in on a Netbook/Laptop. Overall I found this hotel to be a very nice place to stay for our time in Rome. The reviews by a lot of people here on TripAdvisor have been quite harsh to say the least, unless they had incredibly bad experiences or are just very picky. I'd definitely use this hotel again. It was a pleasure staying here and definitely deserves its 4 stars. The one thing I was quite disappointed about was the breakfast in the mornings. There were the same things on offer every morning, and after the 3rd breakfast it was quite bland and uninteresting. I found myself just having a bowl of cereal, cup of coffee and some juice then leaving. It would have been nice to see more variety. Nevertheless, I'd give the hotel a 4/5.

It is about a 20 minute journey, between walking and the metro, to get to the town centre. However, the hotel sits about 5-10 minutes walk from the closest metro station - Cornelia - and is 5 stops from the centre of the city. The service on the metro is reliable and fast and we didnt get pick-pocketed at all (although I hear it is quite common). The hotel is on metro line A which stops at the Vatican, Spanish steps, Trevi fountain and Pantheon, with most other attractions - Colosseum etc, within a comfortable walking distance. In general, it is pretty easy to get to all the attractions of Rome as long as you have a map (a good tourist map is provided by the hotel on check-in) and are wearing comfortable shoes! (A mistake I made on the first day!) The staff are friendly and speak very good English. They were more than happy to help whenever we had questions, and whilst the breakfast was simple and could have been fresher, it was definitely edible and provided much needed fuel for a long days sightseeing!!! The room itself was clean and spacious enough, with a reasonable mini-bar and ok views, and there were always clean towels and hot water (in contrary to what other travellers have written on this site!!) In our experience, the air conditioning was definitely not too noisy and very efficient!! The bathroom was equipped with both a shower and bath as well as a bidet which we definitely werent expecting! One thing that was a bit annoying was that the metro stops at 10pm most nights, but bus number 46 stops at the end of the road, as does night bus number 5 (depending on what time you decide to go home!!!) You can buy a 3 day metrebus (metro/bus) ticket for 11euros and then enjoy exploring the wonders of this gorgeous city!!! In general, I think that the hotel has been a bit under sold on this site and that really it was better than we had expected. The fact that it is a little way from town shouldn't put you off staying here, as long as you are able to walk a bit and have a bit of sense of adventure, its a pretty cool hotel. And much better than anything you could find in the centre of Rome for the same money!!! P.S. its not on any of the '10 must-visit places' but I would recommend that you go to the church San Marco, near the Monumento a Vittorio Emmanuelle, because it was beautiful and quiet and really cool inside and there weren't crowds of tourists destroying the atmosphere!!!

I was very surprised. Finally I tried to do it with the help of some others.

Overall i would say the hotel is ok if one just wants a place to sleep at night and nothing else, and it's a bit too far from any of the tourist areas of rome the", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire,England", "Title": "\u201cClose to Vatican City ?????\u201d", "Author": "CWLeics", "ReviewID": "UR3211253", "Content": "Traveller from Leicester, England - Feb 2005 We arrived at the Marc Aurelio after walking around aimlessly from the Metro Station looking for the hotel for about 30 minutes. The hotel was very clean, and the staff were friendly. The bars on the bedroom window and the rubbish piled up outside left alot to be desired. Breakfast was ok, pretty standard continental breakfast. A bit dissapointing that the 'relaxing' American bar was not open, which would have been well worth it for the hotel in our opinion, as it was too far to walk to any decent bar or restaurant. The air conditioning is absolutely dreadful, it comes on when it wants too, even when the room is already very cold. It is also extremely loud, especially at 5am in the morning. The hotel states it is close to the Vatican City, if you call 5 stops on the Metro close, then you won't be dissapointed.", "Date": "February 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "leicester", "Title": "\u201ctoo far from rome\u201d", "Author": "maggiannLeicester", "ReviewID": "UR3195555", "Content": "looked very nice from front ,rooms very clean but beds small much too far from centre of rome and no bar in the hotel towels very thin also, but worst of all was the very noisy air conditioning system which made sleep almost impossible would not stay there again.", "Date": "February 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london england", "Title": "\u201cair con. no way\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2613774", "Content": "It seemed miles away from city on the bus along very clogged streets.
