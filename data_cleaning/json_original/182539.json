A reasonable rate for a Queen Sized bed Suite, Room 343, which included complimentary breakfast and free WiFi. Upon our entrance of the suite, we noticed it was cold inside, almost as cold as the 5-degree February weather we had just escaped.\u00a0 No problem, we thought - we turned on the room heating system and settled in.\u00a0 It was a clean and attractively decorated room, with a bathroom that invited a nice warm shower.\u00a0 A hotter-than usual shower setting is what we needed to offset the cold room. So, we indulged in this after watching t.v. for 30 minutes. \u00a0 It was to our dismay that we soon learned the room was still cold; what a contrast in temperature, from a hot shower to a bedroom that was still cold!\u00a0 The air from the heater was only slightly warm after one hour.\u00a0 A phone call to the front desk gave rise to a smirky response from the tired-sounding front desk clerk, who replied that I should have started at a lower heat setting first and then gradually move it up to high after 30 minutes. { Oh yes, I SHOULD have known to do it this way}.\u00a0 And so we persevered under his instructions.\u00a0 The next 30 minutes of igloo living seemed like frozen hell, at 1:30am. Finally, with a bit of frustration boiling over, I went to the front desk and tried hard to inquire \"nicely\" about a portable space heater.\u00a0 Oh, what's that, they have all been taken?\u00a0 Ok, I then asked for an extra set of blankets.\u00a0 Sheepishly handed over.\u00a0 Wow, what initiative! Customer service initiated by myself.\u00a0 This tired front-desk clerk was not about to use any energy to come up with suggestions, like the ones I just conjured up. Back to the room... And so, our tired minds and bodies gave in to sleep, under heavy layers of blankets which barely fought off the cold around us.\u00a0 We were able to sleep until the time to enjoy the complimentary breakfast which was waiting for us in the morning. In fact, we barely just got in. Actually the toast-eggs-bacon-and coffee was super!\u00a0 That, I can say was the best part of the hotel stay!\u00a0\u00a0 Talking to the new - and much different - front desk clerk this next morning, I mentioned our frigid reception.\u00a0 He was most apologetic and conceded the fact that management had had some previous similar complaints about the night clerk as well.\u00a0 In fact, just that same morning, the night clerk had been observed hanging up on a guest who had telephoned to give some constructive feedback!\u00a0 The morning clerk also said that he would have also suggested moving us to anothe room, if it were him attending to us. We won't be visiting this hotel for a while. A month later, I dropped in in the afternoon and talked to a South-Asian-looking front desk gentleman, inquiring if they had received our written feedback.\u00a0\u00a0 Wow, what an apathetic response.\u00a0 I might as well have been talking to a robot.\u00a0 I pulled out the hotel receipt to show the date and hotel room, and he didn't even pretend to take any notice of it.\u00a0 He just said, yes, all feedback is read by management, and any training issues on a specific individual would be looked into.

Don't let the name fool you, according to the fare zone, it belongs to Zone 1 i.e. Vancouver and Metrotown is in Burnaby. If you travelled to Metrotown, you would require ticket for two zones. When we checked in, we were greetd by a young man and took him a little bit of time to find out our reservation. The hotel corridor and room looked a bit old and should require renovation very soon. Romm amenities are baisc. They have a outdoor pool opened during Summer time and laundry room for hotel guest. We picked this hotel due to its location for public transportation and foods. You have Safeway and liquor store next door which are open until mid-night. Starbuck is opposite and along the Kingsway you have plenty of Chinese and Asian restaurants and stores to choose from.

He gave us information on good eating spots and answered any questions we had. (Ramada, if you are reading this, you know who he is. Give the man a raise! He is great!) ROOM PROBLEMS The hallways seem a bit shabby and outdated but the room was more sophisticated and clean. It had a mini-fridge and coffee maker which was great! From the get-go, however, we had problems with the air-conditioner. First of all, it was high up on the wall. It didn't throw out cool air and there was no way to adjust the temperature. You could only turn if on and off by a light switch on the wall. It began to leak and it leaked all night. No, it practically poured all night! It leaked all over the rug and end table. The floor was soaked and we knew we didn't want to stay in that room anymore! The next morning we heard a grinding, sickening clunk and the A/C chuckled weakly and died. We had to be on our way to a meeting for the whole day and mentioned the problem to the desk. They said that they would see if it could be fixed and if not, we would have to be moved to another room. When we came back late that afternoon, we found out that they upgraded us to a 1BD suite at no extra cost! That was such an awesome thing to do! Again, the staff at the desk were polite, helpful and even asked us how things were every time we'd walk by at later times! 1 BD SUITE Folks, the 1 BD suites are THE way to go. I would spend the extra money next time to get it instead of the regular room. In addition to the extra space, there is also a microwave and two televisions. The bedding is WAY more comfortable than the regular rooms. It was thick and plush where as the regular rooms simply had plain sheets and a thin comforter. It is in another wing of the hotel with a different elevator. The suite section was much more isolated and quiet. At least it seemed that way to me. The A/C was a large unit located under the window with all kinds of adjustments to be made and NO leaks! We enjoyed this upgrade very much and if I stayed there again, I'd take the suite! FACILITIES The pool looked nice though we never had the chance to use it. We ordered food from the pub and it was reasonably priced and good. LOCATION The location is really good. You are not far from most of the things to do. It is located on Kingsway which takes you (or leads you to roads) where you need to go. It is only minutes from Metrotown Mall. There is a Safeway and a liquor store parallell to it, a Subway a half block down the other side, a Starbucks across the street and another down a few blocks.

It made me sick watching housekeeping attempting to clean my room. I mean is it common practice for pillows with clean pillow cases on them to be layed on the disgusting dirty and smelly floor as the bed is being made, and may I ad being made as in the sheets never being changed. How about after your bathroom is cleaned ie: toilet, tub, floor, etc, the housekeeper uses there same dirty and disgusting hands to give you fresh towels... Well at least I hope they were fresh. They never once vacuumed the room even though they had it waiting on there cart ready to use. I could honestly write my name in the dust on basically any piece of furniture in the room. This was just disgusting and very unclean. To top it off I'm still waiting for the Ramada to address any of my issues which I suppose they have chosen to ignore.

The hotel is easy to find in eastern Vancouver on Kingsway at Tyne Street -- in the Collingwood neighborhood -- and five blocks west of the Metrotown regional shopping district (which is right across the city line in Burnaby). Since you have to change busses to get downtown, people who really want to be in center city wouldn't be happy here. But the bus that runs on Kingway connects to almost everywhere. I did not dine at Jaguars, the restaurant attached to the Ramada. But the fact is, I counted about 80 different small restaurants on Kingway in both directions from the hotel. Whatever cuisine you want, if you look, you will find it. My room had all the basics. Nothing was elaborate or fancy, but everything necessary for a good night's sleep was there.

There are a few rooms that you may ask not to stay in due to noise factors: ask to be away from the drink machine and the elevator. The staff were very friendly & always smiling. The fitness center has a treadmill, eliptical & recumbant bike along with a weight bench. Our rooms were spotless each day.

(Not their fault, they were doing as they were required to by their employers.) I had no idea we were getting a smoking room. (My son has asthma). The door going up to the floors had a deadbolt on it, to stop the \"evening traffic\" from going upstairs. The Safeway across the road said they has to take all the payphones out due to activity and \"transactions\" going on in the neighborhood. Again, the photos are misleading. I used some trip rewards to get our rooms, and YES, I got them refunded to my account. It took months, but the manager finally gave them back to me.
