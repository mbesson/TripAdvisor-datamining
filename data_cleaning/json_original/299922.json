What was lacking was how customers are treated, and no matter how nice the hotel, being rude and the \"oops we forgot to tell you about the other charges\" way of doing business breaks the deal. First, they just kinda forget to tell you that their formerly free parking lot is now considered a revenue source. It is now $13/night to park your car. In my opinion, this amounts to false advertising and gouging. You aren't paying for valet service here, so why the charge? The lot is there anyway, it hasn't been charged for in the past, and this is one step short of charging your for your showers. Second, the staff is rude. When I asked why I wasn't told about the parking fees when I made the reservations, she said it wasn't her problem.

We were efficiently checked in and found the room to be clean and of sufficient size for a comfortable one-night stay. The wireless internet didn't work right but a call to the technical support got it working in about 15 minutes, but it was pretty slow. We took the shuttle to the orange line 'L' stop to eat downtown and were told by the driver just to call on the courtesy phone when we got back and they'd pick us up. We got back and looked all over for the courtesy phone. The CTA cop said that we were like the 4th people to ask for the courtesy phone and he had no idea what we were talking about. So we walked over to the airport terminal and found our way to the baggage claim area. We looked outside and saw a shuttle, flagged it down, and got a ride back. I still don't know where that courtesy phone is. The front desk and driver were also friendly at 3:45 AM when we left for the airport. Fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies were also placed on the front desk, and I assumed they were for the guests, and if indeed they were, then this was a nice touch. I understand that this hotel is the second cheapest in the complex, so if you're going to be flying out of Midway and you're looking for a comfortable night sleep before your flight, this is a good choice.", "Date": "December 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cGood Value and Service\u201d", "Author": "Watergate", "ReviewID": "UR2608504", "Content": "We stayed here the night before our flight out of Midway airport.

We took advantage of the free shuttle to both the El and the airport, as well as the included continental breakfast.
