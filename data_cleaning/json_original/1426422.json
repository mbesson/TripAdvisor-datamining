After reading some fantastic reviews about Ad Place we decided to make a reservation, and we weren't dissapointed, this hotel was the most delightful place and we had a really fantastic time. We were welcomed upon arrival and then shown to our room 'Giugno' (June) which really had the wow factor with lovely stylish decor and a view of the beautiful canals from both windows. After checking in the hotel staff provided us with lots of information about places to visit and things to see. They also recommended some local restaurants, which were truly amazing. Breakfast was served from 7:30 to 10:30 each morning in the central breakfast area and there was a fantastic array of pastries, cheese, boiled and scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, juices, teas, everything you could want and more! This boutique hotel has just 12 rooms, the reception is on the ground floor and most of the rooms are on the first floor, with the breakfast area being in the centre of these, which means just a few paces to get your breakfast each morning! On the day of my birthday my partner had a few surprises planned, a marriage proposal being one of them! The hotel owner - Alessandro - really couldn't do enough to help him with the surprise and went to a lot of trouble to decorate the room on that day by putting candles, rose petals, a beautiful single rose, candelabras, a vintage bottle of prosecco and strawberries in the room so on our return from a memorable gondala ride, the room had been wonderfully decorated, it was the most romantic thing I've ever seen. To top this the gondolas could be heard singing outside the hotel which just made this the most romantic and enjoyable experience ever (I'm smiling now just thinking about it!) I will remember this experience for eternity and my partner and I are so grateful to Alessandro and his team. We will definitively return to this hotel in the near future, we're currently considering it for our honeymoon. So, if you're thinking of booking this hotel just do it - don't even think about it - Venice is a wonderful place and getting lost in the winding streets is an unforgettable experience. Our top tips are to sample a Bellini or two, buy some Murano glass as a momento to take home, and just soak up the atmosphere and enjoy this wonderful city. Once again, thanks to Alessandro and his team - we will be back as soon as we can - and in the meantime just keep doing what you do to make your hotel a truly wonderful place to visit, we just can't recommend your hotel enough!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING!\u201d", "Author": "shjnmee", "ReviewID": "UR127301245", "Content": "I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice! The staff were wonderful, helpful and friendly. The breakfast was a good combination of bacon, scrambled eggs, croissants, cakes, fruits, juices and cereals, it was served between 7:30 and 10:30 am, excellent timing whether you are having a lie in or starting your day early. They provide tea and coffee all day (self service) in the breakfast room which you are able to take to you room or enjoy the rooftop terrace. We stayed in the 'September' room and were amazed by the elegence and wow factor of the room as soon as the door was opened! The room did have a mini bar with drinks at very reasonable prices. The hotel staff recommended some super resturants and provided us with a map, highlighting all the must see sights. To be honest, the staff couldn't do enough for us, they were so helpful and nothing was ever too much to ask. We did not book any trips before going, the hotel arranged a walking tour of San Marco and Doges Palace and a shared gondola ride (much cheaper than if you arrange yourself). If you are interested in having a wifi connection during your stay then they do provide you with an access code upon check in to use during your stay. The location was perfect as it was easy to find (the hotel emailed us a map before our arrival) and in a very central location between San Marco and Rialto. Prior to our trip, we did contact the concierge regarding how to get from the airport (Marco Polo) to the hotel and they were very informative and provided websites we could book transport through in advance. We ended up booking with Alilaguna and paid 24 euros each for a return trip from the airport. The water taxi was every half an hour and from San Marco roughly took about an hour and twenty minutes. The hotel did also tell us that a private water taxi would be about 120 euros from the airport. We fell in love with Venice and recommend you get lost and explore all the winding streets. The hotel was a big part of our stay and we were more than happy to return to it every evening. Very romantic! We can not thank the staff at the hotel enough for all they did.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cQuirky, fun & well located\u201d", "Author": "kidwell_james", "ReviewID": "UR127067137", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend in mid March. We arrived and departed by boat taxi direct from the airport which cost 120 Euros each way but was a lovely way to do it - all organised via the hotel. The hotel is quite new, and the staff were extremely polite and helpful and very good with their restaurant suggestions and general knowledge of Venice. Our bedroom was interestingly decorated in a modern version of baroque - all very opulent. My only negative was that the lighting was quite dim - probably deliberately so for atmosphere - but it did make reading quite difficult. The breakfasts were good with the usual international spread of options and plenty of coffee and tea on a help yourself basis. We found the hotel to be very well located as it is about 10 mins from St Marks Square and a short walk from some lovely squares with restaurants in them and the bridge across to the Guggenheim etc. The ferry and tregetti stops are close at hand too. A potential drawback for some is that the rooms are all on the second floor as is the breakfast room - only reception is at ground level. This didnt worry us as they were very happy to porter our bags and there is a stannah style lift on the stairs if necessary.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFriendly helpful staff, stylish hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "LondonChrissieC", "ReviewID": "UR126675738", "Content": "We spent 3 nights at the Ad Place in Venice.

The only disadvantage I can think of is that there aren't enough tabels during breakfast to seat all guests.

Bedroom and bathroom were very clean, and well serviced every day. My room was quite small (lovely firm bed), but we were out almost all day, so it didn't matter. If you feel like spending a little more, a superior room will give much more space and a better canal view. Lots of stairs to climb, but good for working up an appetite before going out to dinner (hotel recommended good restaurants).

The staff are fantastic and cannot do more to help and always have a warm inviting smile, no matter what time of day! Beatrice very kindly made lots of lunch/dinner recommendations and booked them all for us, which was very kind. There were lots of lovely little touches - like offering us hot chocolate proactively when we came back to rest our feet from the cold...Kamal also gave us a free bottle of champagne one evening with a selection of snacks and fruits! We had a superior room which was very large for Venetian standards and was beautiful - it had a gorgeous view of the canal and was so romantic with four-poster bed and lovely decor - think antique furniture with a slight modern twist - Venetian style but without the gaudiness. The slight let-down was the bathroom, which was rather narrow and looked like it could do with a slight make-over. There was no bath which was a shame but the rain shower itself was fantastic with good pressure. Another (minor) gripe was the hairdryer which was awful and doesn't generate any heat at all and having long hair, this was frustrating. But Beatrice in reception happened to have a spare hairdryer for me to borrow so this was not a problem. I would advise you to take your own portable one. The location is one of this hotel's best features. We were 5 minutes from San Marco square and 10 min from Rialto - we walked everywhere and didn't have to rely on water taxis at all except to and from the airport. Bearing in mind that water taxis are expensive in Venice, this can be a huge cost saving. Another point also is that there are lots of good restaurants very locally within 10 minutes of the hotel so you needn't venture too far if you were feeling lazy. Breakfasts were good and plentiful. The warm options were not that great but we didn't mind as there was a lot of fruit, pastries, cheese, yoghurts etc. All in all , this is a a great hotel - do take the private water taxi from the airport but if you do make sure they take you RIGHT IN FRONT of the hotel!!! Ours conned us and dropped us 10 minutes walk away and not ideal when lugging a suitcase over two bridges!On the way back to the airport we took the water taxi right from the front of the hotel ...it's expensive but the views are jaw-dropping and it's so much fun.

We had 3 suitcases and walking up and down bridges and the steps was frustrating..Everyone we asked said \"just go straight\". You CAN'T go straight in Venice! We looked forever and I got cranky..finally found it. Couldn't check in until 2 so we dropped our bags and walked around Venice. Went back and checked in and took a good look. Very nice young man at front desk, huge apples and chocolates at reception. A very odd mix of black and grey striped walls, Bohemian mix..wood beams on ceilings.

Like most Venice hotels, AD Place can be a little hard to find at first, but if you remember it's next to the Santa Maria del Giglio church and the theatre, you can't go wrong. The rooms are all individually designed, and we stayed on the ground floor in a junior suite. The decor is stunning, the beds huge and comfortable, the bathrooms well equipped and very modern. Breakfast is the only food available in the hotel and was a little limited, but we were happy with bacon & eggs as the only warm option. One downside is the breakfast room is on the top floor and there is no lift, so if you have difficulty with stairs, maybe this hotel isn't ideal for you (although I heard they will bring breakfast to your room). The staff were excellent, and even arranged for a surprise tray of Champagne & nibbles for our return on our wedding day.

Getting there was easy from getting off at the S. Giglio stop on Line 1 of the vaporetto - straight up the little alley, through the small square (Campo San giglio) over the bridge to the left at the end of the square and then it's on your left. It's not signposted outside but just look for number 2557 which is on the outside of the building The staff were lovely and spoke excellent English. There are no lifts but they will take your luggage up to your room for you. We were initially in \"Dicembre\" room, which was lovely. Small entrance area then separate bedroom area with 4 poster bed that had a tv above it on the ceiling! I think someone else has mentioned there's not much shelving in the bathroom but it's an insignificant thing compared to how great this hotel is overall. We had a tour guide meet us at the hotel one morning and the manager overheard us telling her we'd just got married and when we returned in the afternoon we had been upgraded to \"Marzo\" room - which was incredible - small lobby, lounge with tv, minibar, coffee maker, tv and exercise bike (!). Then bedroom with 2 canal views another minibar and tv and a sony playstation. Bathroom had a huge bath, 2 sinks - the whole thing was amazing. Even without the upgrade i would have been delighted with our stay - as i said staff were lovely, especially Alessandro who helped us with questions about directions/booking transfers etc, and if you need, they will print off boarding passes for you. The breakfast room is lovely, with plenty of choice. You can make yourself an expresso from the machine but there is also a member of staff around who will ask if you want tea/coffee/cappucino etc. The decor is amazing, a lovely twist on traditional Venetian style, with bright funky colours and interesting details on the coffee mugs and cutlery. If you need to use a computer just ask at reception and they will give you a laptop and password, you can take the laptop to your room if you like or use it in the seating area in reception. There's also a little rooftop terrace with sofas which is nice to relax on in the afternoon after a day walking around the sights. Very near St. Marks square - 5 mins maximum and Rialto about 10 mins and great that the S. Giglio stop is so close by. I would absolutely recommend this hotel.

The good news: the hotel goes out of its way to answer questions about Venice(I had many by email before arriving, and they answered all quickly and thoroughly), and they surprised us with champagne on our last night. BUT...(1) no elevator (important if you have any mobility issues, or don't want to climb 3 flights of stairs at the end of every day), (2) very quirky layout, being an old house converted so rooms are odd sized and lacking any functional layout (no closet only a small wardrobe with 5 hangers, two drawers, and the bathroom is without any shelving) plus floors VERY creaky so you can't move quietly at night, (3) confusing food setup, mugs were available occasionally for the coffee machine but sometimes the entire coffee supply would disappear or there were no cups at all for the day and there was no coffee offered at breakfast (but it seems you can ask for it to be made specially...again unclear and if you don't inquire you won't know what is or is not included). It's on a canal, yes, but a small arterial one and the rooms face a building so 'canal view' is out your window, looking straight down to the small bit of water below. Kamal was particularly helpful and arranged all transfers perfectly on time. It would be hard to find without a water taxi so recommend the added expense vs the public taxi (a nightmare of lineups, additional fees for luggage and only one piece is allowed, and you would struggle for an extra half hour just trying to find the place unless you had GPS or Google Earth or something like that).

Rooms were cleaned each time we left our room, fresh towels etc. To be honest we wanted a nice comfy hotel and one which would be an ideal base from which we could explore Venice this hotel was bang on! - i mean you dont come to Venice to sit in an hotel room all day ! therefore AD Place was ideal we loved it and would come back again - although we are still unsure about the apple decorations in the room lol !", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHidden location, helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "L0ndonGent", "ReviewID": "UR113792976", "Content": "My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in early June.

Although the AD Place wasn't cheap, it looked nice and was in a good location, exactly 5 minutes walk (yes, I timed it!) from Piazza San Marco and when you're only going for a few days that's important. A number of reviewers on here have mentioned that the hotel is hard to find - I would agree to some extent and it is definitely worth printing out a map before you arrive. However, basically everywhere is quite hard to find in Venice (part of the charm of the place) so I can't really complain on that account. Location wise you're right behind La Fenice, with access to the Dorsoduro and south west from the Accademia bridge less than 10 mins walk, the edge of Piazza San Marco 5 mins away and the Rialto bridge less than 15 mins walk. So essentially it's a great location. It's just off the main tracks enough that it's quiet, but not so far that it seems like a trudge. For a short break, it's perfect. There are only 12 rooms in the hotel, so it's very bijou and boutique. When you walk in the reception area is nicely lit, with a collection of interesting \"objet d'art\" scattered around, some funky furniture and a small bar area just off the hallway. As with most Venetian hotels, there are plenty of steps. As you leave the reception, you have to schlep up a couple of steep flights of stairs, and although the staff are more than happy to help with bags, it could be an issue for some people. I think there are a couple of ground floor rooms and there is also a Stannah stair lift-esque device for people in wheelchairs. Once you reach the first floor there is a little communal landing, which becomes a breakfast room in the mornings, with tea and coffee making facilities available. If you take another flight of stairs, there are more rooms and you get to a little veranda which would be lovely in summer for a pre dinner Spritz, but wasn't much use in the cold January evenings! The room we had was off the breakfast room, called Giugno (June - all the 12 rooms are named after months). The room wasn't big by any stretch but it was fine, and again, it's Venice and space is at a premium. The bed was large and comfy, there was a big flat screen tv on the wall (showing 90+ Italian channels) and a decent sized wardrobe. The en suite was excellent quality, with a good strong shower. A bath would have been nice for relaxing after a long day of exploring, but again, space wise having a really good shower was probably more practical. Decor-wise the rooms were typical Venetian OTT - purple and green striped wall paper, purple lamp shades, green duvet, purple head board, with a marble floor. Now, this might not be to everyone's taste, but it's fun and gives it a lot more character than some drab magnolia room. The service in general at the hotel was really excellent. Because there are only 12 rooms, the reception is never too busy, so you get a much more personal service than at a larger hotel. They were very helpful with restaurant suggestions (Venice is a restaurant minefield-finding the gems that aren't super expensive isn't easy!) as well as generally being friendly. After we overslept on the first morning and turned up 20 mins after breakfast was over, they were very accommodating, bringing us coffee and generally being cool, when in many places you would get a disinterested, passive aggressive \"uh, breakfast is actually finished...\" A special mention has to go to Kamal who was on reception at night. He was always very friendly and would always make us a lovely little selection of snacks when he brought up our post-dinner drinks. He was even kind enough to bring us up a bottle of Prosecco as a gift on our last night, which was very touching - as I've said, there's a level of personal service that is hard to beat. If I were going to criticise anything then I'd say that the cooked portion of the breakfast buffet wasn't great. Limp bacon, overdone scrambled eggs and cooling hard boiled eggs - just not quite up to scratch for a Brit who likes a cooked breakfast. However, the continental spread was decent and at the end of the day, it's included anyway so you can't complain too much.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bamako", "Title": "\u201cUnforgettable\u201d", "Author": "Juanfrutos", "ReviewID": "UR93238789", "Content": "An unforgettable stay and honeymoon in a delightful town.

When you get to the 3rd floor you will walk into the breakfast area. They have 4 tables up and when they are not being used at breakfast they have drapes hanging over them, it was very cool to look at. We ended staying in the purple room that is advertised on the website, and it did not let us down. The walls were covered in fabric instead of wallpaper which was an interesting touch. The most beautiful bedspread and pillows accented the beautiful chandelier. We overlooked the cannels and everyday we heard the gondolas singers go by, it was amazing! The hotel was very clean, and the staff was very helpful. There is a fabulous girl working at the front desk that helped us with everything, and never let us down with food request.

We arrived around 7 or 8 pm and a reception for a local artist was in progress to which we were invited. My wife was super delighted both with the room and to be invited to the reception. We were assigned one of the two rooms on the ground floor. There is no second floor or next floor up. The other rooms are on the 3rd and 4th floors. Our room was really a small sitting room and a bedroom, both beautifully done up in all sorts of fabrics and pillows. Due to a storm the hotel's central heating was out and there was a space heater in the room. I'm a lawyer who does a lot of personal injury work and I have represented people burned in hotel fires. I noticed that the charming windows overlooking the canal had iron bars embedded in the ancient walls. Hmmm; lots of fabric, a space heater, and solidly barred windows. Was this first world Europe? I complained and was told that we could have unbarred higher level room the next day but there was nothing open that evening. My wife argued that the room was absolutely gorgeous, the building had obviiously been around for centuries and would surely outlast us and not be scene of a fire during our short stay. Further, she pointed out that both ground floor rooms opened very close to the main entrance: how long could it take to dash out to safety if there were a fire? I gave up worrying about the barred windows and enjoyed the stay. The breakfast fruits (breakfast is included) were picked with obvious care for sweetness and the hotel staff were extremely conscientious about answering our questions however detailed and helping me with a problem that developed with our return flight. Service is taken very seriously. (For what it is worth, bars on ground floor windows in Venice are extremely common and I didn't see any fire escapes.) The hotel has a great location, but the fact is that Venice is so small that unless you cannot walk comfortably, where in Venice proper that you are is not that important. Due to the fact that we visited off-season in cool weather made walking in Venice a pleasure. In fact, Venice, can be very magical in early winter: uncrowded, cool, and misty. Two off-beat places to visit are the Venice naval museum (Exhibit explanations in English) and what used to be its fleet mooring area. (Venice was once a great naval power.)

I knew nothing about Italy, Venice or AD Place before I booked my wife's surprise(10th Anniversary) trip in July 2010. I used the trip advisor website to read reviews and decide which were my shortlist of hotels. I opted for AD Place just purely on some key factors from the reviews and these were location, favourable reviews and basically the pictures on their own website. So I was very much recommended from the web. The Room My experiences were based on a peak time stay over 3 nights (July 2010). We went for the Classic Double option at this hotel and I decided on the room called September which is situated on the top floor right next to the penthouse roof top terrace. If you want to relate the room name to the actual pictures on their own website then checkout pictures numbers 22,23 and 24. The room was cool, could hear a pin drop. looked and smelt lovely. Very purple theme. The bathroom was fine for us although the toilet was a little in the corner but reachable. Shower was a brilliant size. Can I add a note to say that this particular room does not have a window overlooking the canals but please don't let this put you off. I knew this in-advance of our stay and it never became an issue during our stay because most of the time you are out and about. If you need views then treat the roof top terrace as your balcony. There is a safe in the room which is free to use. Tap in your personal code and you are away. We had an ipod dock and controls to operate the velux electric blinds. Plenty of mirrors in the room. Breakfast Perfect. I feel there is plenty of choice to get you started on your day. Fresh oranges to squeeze your own juice and more fruit than you could shake a stick at. Cereals, scrambled egg on toast together, biscuits to name a few items. I could agree that perhaps a few additional items could be added but overall we were happy. Staff Fantastic. The staff at AD Place were the best we have ever experienced at any hotel we have been to in any country. In particular Beatrice and Kamal who we spoke to the most were excellent. Beatrice worked during the day and advised us on a few eating establishments. Meanwhile Kamal who worked during the night was brilliant too. He kindly provided a bottle of bubbly together with some snacks in our room on our first night. A lovely touch and made our evening after a long day. The other chappy who I cannot remember his name was also very welcoming when we briefly spoke. Hotel Overall We did not find the hotel difficult to find. Infact we walked directly to it. Just make sure you print off the map on their website and you will not have any trouble. It's perfectly located about 5 - 7 minutes walk to the main square. Nicely tucked away from the busy areas. Superb central location. Reception area is modern with local character and charm. It has all the mod cons including Wifi which did not cause too much problem although perhaps our room was furtherest from the routers which meant our connection, on occasions, was briefly interrupted. Not a big deal... Finally the stairs were not a problem. Yes there are a few flights but nothing to worry about. Luggage goes up on a chair lift so no humping about. Breakfast is served within the room below so hardly far to walk. Quick word on Venice including budgeting... Loads and loads of walking. Not cheap but then Europe is not at the moment. Expect to pay around 110.00 euro for a gondolier ride (ours was about 35 minutes). A good meal will be around 90 euro with soft drinks and the odd italian bear. 8 euro each for the trip up the Campanile tower in St Mark's Square. Temp in July for us was around 32 degrees with full Sun during our stay. Water taxi from Airport cost me 90 euro online before our trip. I paid 110.00 euro to go from the hotel to the airport for the return trip. We paid around 50 euro for a 48 hour Vaporetto pass for two people. Ice cream was fantastic. Best you could ever taste at around 2 euros each. Best value in Venice. Cheaper meals can be had a Burger King and McDonalds. One of each in Venice. I hope everyone finds this of use. Venice is great and thanks once again to AD Place for making our stay perfect with great memories....

It was so wonderful we wanted to take the staff home with us, especially Kamal. When you first walk in to AD Place you are greeted by candles upon candles and decadent looking fabrics. At night they light all the candles and the hotel glows so softly. We arrived there after almost 12 hours of travel and a six hour time difference. We were greeted by Alessandro and he was very gracious and welcoming. He showed us this exquisite gem of a hotel and got us settled in our room. Our room was April, one of the superior rooms and it was spacious. We had a beautiful canopy bed two well appointed armoires and a gorgeous colour palette. It looked like a fancy French confectionary or my childhood dream come to life. Our bathroom was on the small side but more than adequate and had plenty of hot water. After unpacking and showering we spent a little time gazing out our window to the canal. We went back downstairs for a quick chat with Alessandro for recommendations for lunch and we went exploring. That night on my arrival back to our room a single long stemmed rose awaited me. The next morning we were ready for breakfast. It is not a huge breakfast (nor am I a huge breakfast eater), there was American style coffee, espresso, tea, water, fresh squeeze it yourself orange juice and water. Eggs were available as was toast, yogurt, and a variety of pastries and fruit. The setting was lovely. The food was adequate, but was perhaps the only thing that could use a little improving. On our return the next evening we met Kamal. I think Kamal was born to be in the hotel business. Never have I had anyone so concerned that I was attended to. When I was offered a lovely glass of Prosesso it was never just handed to me in a glass, rather, it came with little treats and the presentation was everything. There was no request too big or too small that we could make to Kamal that did not get met. In fact he anticipated our needs and went beyond our expectations. We were treated to two bottles of champagne on our stay (we stayed 7 nights) and we drank one on the lovely terrace and the other we enjoyed in our room listening to the canal outside our window. On the day we left, we checked out and much to Alessandro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horror we carried our own bags to the front desk. He expressed that had he known we were on our way down, he would have gladly given us a hand. He kindly checked us onto our flights and arranged a water taxi to the airport for later that night. He was also kind enough to store our bags, so that we could enjoy an extra few hours in Venice before heading to the airport. We arrived back to the hotel about 15 minutes before our water taxi and Kamal insisted we remember this moment with another glass of prosecco. We were not allowed to carry our bags out the door, as Kamal preferred we enjoyed our drinks while he took care of loading the bags.

The attention to detail really made our stay so special - the complimentary chocolates in the room; the mojitos in the afternoon; the rose left on our bed on the day of our wedding anniversary; the complimentary champagne presented on a silver tray scattered with rose petals... Aesthetically, the hotel itself is immersed in this attention to detail. It is a blend of bohemian and traditional; funky and baroque. We stayed in the October room, which together with the grand interior and the space, made us feel like royalty. The roof terrace was a romantic delight. I love the feel of this boutique hotel. It is sexy and charming and everywhere you look your eye is in for a treat. The staff were absolutely wonderful. They were incredibly attentive, friendly and efficient. Alessandro at reception was our first contact. He made us feel very welcome, and was very helpful with everything from tips on restaurants to advice on how to be 'street smart' in Venice. However ALL the staff we came in contact with were very pleasant and helpful including the staff person at breakfast and the night clerk (sorry didn't get your names). Breakfast was a continental buffet with fresh juices, fruits, cakes (loved the custard filled donuts) as well as the usual European delicacies. Location wise, we couldn't have asked for a more convenient spot. About a 5 minute walk to St Marks Square and about a 2 minute walk to the vaporetti/ACTV rendering you close to all the attractions. But one tip I would offer is that if you are able to walk, you really don't need the services of the vaporetti. Everything is very very close and walking around gives you the opportunity to explore and discover (oh, and get lost over and over). Besides, at 6.50 Euro a ride per person, it can get very expensive. On the downside for this hotel, is the unavoidable noise produced by the men collecting garbage in the morning. Thankfully it wasn't too early and most mornings we were awake anyway. The other thing to be aware of is that there is no elevator in the hotel. We did not have a problem with the stairs, but if I were to bring my mother here, for example, I would request a room that doesn't require so much of a hike. In sum, we found our visit to Venice was enhanced by staying at the AD Place hotel. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, but never have we felt so pampered as we did here. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I look forward to one day going back.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful City, Great hotel\u201d", "Author": "doctorST", "ReviewID": "UR64856655", "Content": "We spent two nights at the AD Place in Venice.

After a four-night stay I can confirm that the hotel deserves the excellent reputation that it has earned. My family of 5 was visiting Venice for the first time. My spouse and I have three children, aged 9, 7 and 4. We booked the hotel's junior suite (called the \"November\" suite), which has a sitting room (converted for us into a sleeping room with a high-quality sofabed), and a larger bedroom with a large and comfortable bed. There was a small but impeccably clean bathroom with a shower (no bathtub). The furniture, room fixtures and bed linens were of luxurious quality. The suite is on the ground floor of the hotel with several windows looking out onto a small canal. The entire hotel was extremely clean, in an old building refurbished to very high standards of quality and design. The location is excellent: nestled in a quiet and clean part of central Venice, an easy walk from most major sights. It is a relatively small hotel, with I believe only 12 rooms. The size of the hotel gives it an intimate charm and exclusivity, especially thanks to the superb personalised service of the small staff. Upon arrival we were greeted by name by Alessandro, who gave us welcome beverages as we checked in and discussed our needs and preferences. Upon my request prior to arrival, Alessandro had arranged to have a huge bouquet of flowers waiting for my wife in the suite. Over the 5 days of our stay Alessandro was cheerful and helpful, giving excellent advice and making us feel at home. The night concierge, Kamal, always welcomed us warmly after long days out sightseeing, with complimentary refreshements and fresh fruit or nuts or other light snacks, and he was efficient and responsive whenever we had any requests. The breakfast is a self-service buffet with a good variety of options. There is an espresso machine and a citrus press, various other beverages, pastries, cold cheeses and meats, fresh fruits, bread, and on most days there was a big heated pan with additional hot choices (eggs, meats, etc.) The breakfast buffet of course does not rival buffets of major 400-room hotels, but it has plenty of choices. For restaurants we either followed the excellent recommendations of Alessandro, or went to some off-the-beaten-path places that had been recommended by friends. Wi-fi in the hotel was free, and accessible via a passcode obtained from the receptionist. All in all AD Place was an excellent choice for our stay. The room prices are reasonable for Venice, and excellent value for the discerning traveler willing to spend a bit more for real quality. In my view it is far better to stay here and benefit from the exceptional quality of the establishement and its personalised service, rather than get standard or poor service at overpriced competitors or the major hotel chains, which might be a bit less expensive. Venice is a unique and historic location, and in my view our choice of hotel was a big factor in contributing to an unforgettable week there. We will certainly return to AD Place and recommend it to others.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cSimply Amazing\u201d", "Author": "TampaJulian", "ReviewID": "UR64224730", "Content": "My wife and I were on our honeymoon and our first stop was Venice.

Before leaving I called the hotel to setup a few dinner reservations and Alessandro, the hotel manager, could not have been any more helpful. He suggested several and made reservations for dinner, and offered champagne on the terrace before dinner for my husband's birthday. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Helenora who was an absolutely gem. She was always so friendly and helpful during our entire stay. After a long night we were always met at the door by Kamal, the hotel night manager, who without fail made us feel like we were arriving back at our own personal home. He brought us champagne and snacks and anything we would ask for it was in our room within minutes, and believe that was a feat considering the stairs he had to climb to get there (as part of the original building there is no elevator, the stairs are one of those original features that we ended up having a love/hate relationship with...love for the originality and traditional feel, and well dislike for the workout :) ) Overall we are telling all of our family and friends that when in Venice stay at AD PLACE, no point in risking a subpar hotel experience when AD PLACE is the cherry on top of a beautifully unique city.

Even though we appreciated the kind upgrade, we did not find any of the rooms THAT good. The February room on floor 1 (above ground floor) was nicely decorated with purple, green and pink fabrics. However, the room was absolutely tiny! Even the staff more or less excused the small size of the room when we first checked in. I would guess that the bed was about 1.40 m wide, and we kind of got the feeling that we were staying in a dorm room. This room was also situated next to the breakfast area and passed the shared toilet, which just didn't help. However, I understand that people can see this room as cute, and it would be ok for one person. The November room on the ground floor was quite big. This room was mainly decorated with black and grey, and with an orange/yellow bathroom, a blue sofa and a red carpet. In our view not a nice decoration, but on the other side a fairly modern and nice room. However, our main issue with this room was the location on the ground floor next to a bridge. People could not only look straight into the room, but there was also quite a lot of noice from people walking by (especially when they drag their suitcases over the bridge). Also, the wireless internet did not work properly in this room, and the staff was not able to fix it. I think we would have been quite dissapointed with this room if we had booked a junior suite.

Also, the use of scents and air fresheners in this hotel is a bit over the top (would prefer at least the bedrooms to smell just fresh and clean). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Terrible drainage in the sinks, however the showers were ok.

In fact, sitting in the back of the Vaporetto as you travel the length of the Grand Canal from P. Roma station is an excellent introduction to Venice and affords almost all the photo opportunities you might need. You could almost turn around and fly straight back and you'd have all the pictures you need to fill your Facebook \"Been To Venice\" album. The Hotel nestles in a quiet corner by a bridge overlooking the back of the Teatro Fenice opera house (where Angelina Jolie was filming during our stay!). We arrived early evening and having read all the previous reviews we were rather excited at the prospect of a complimentary glass of prosecco and some nibbles. Huge disappointment. This quite lovely courtesy is only extended to those staying in the superior rooms. Even when we asked if we could buy two glasses of prosecco we were told we couldn't as we'd have to buy a whole bottle. While the hotel is beautifully decorated and the bathrooms nicely appointed, our bedroom was absolutely tiny. The hotel also has plumbing issues - the noises of everybody else's showers, baths and loos flushing kept us awake - as did the clanging in the next door kitchen. Breakfast was lovely, a buffet served in a charming dining room with bacon, eggs, a lovely coffee machine and custard doughnuts to die for. Chatting to fellow guests and whiling away a few half hours over an espresso and croissants, or thumbing through the guide books planning what to see, do and eat was a relaxing and pleasant way to start the day. The biggest caveat is for the city herself - sadly past her best, shabby at the edges and in need of a good scrub and polish, Venice is almost a theme park. Were it not for the tourists in the gondolas, in Cafe Florian and in Harry's Bar these would not exist as there is no reason for them to be.

This place was perfect! 4 minute walk from St Mark's Square and the Grand Canal, plus it is located away from the main walkways and crowds. In fact there were no crowds or people ever around the hotel even at the peak time of the carnival! It is located next to a small canal with a pretty bridge. My room was HUGE although I got a suite for a good deal! I booked and paid 5 months in advance and was able to get a discount as a result. The hotel is very small and quaint making it easy to enter and leave. It is an old Venetian palace and due to its heritage and design there is no elevator but the 2 flights of stairs to the room is not a problem. There is no restaurant at the hotel but there are many good places nearby that the staff is happy to recommend. Breakfast is a basic continental breakfast but good, and you can squeeze the fresh blood orange juice yourself! Another nice touch is that every evening there are delicious gourmet chocolates and glasses of champagne left in reception for guests to take up to their rooms. Staff provided excellent service always even during the night and were very efficient with booking taxis and restaurant reservations for us. The bed sheets and pillows are 5 star hotel quality!! I had one of the best sleep experiences ever! I hurt my foot walking around Venice and needed some medication. I asked the staff for the nearest pharmacy and instead they gave me a whole bag of first aid goods to use and told me to keep it! I had a package that was due to arrive while I was staying there but it arrived two days after I left. The staff were kind enough to have it sent to my home address and did not even charge me for the postage. They simply said it was a pleasure to have us as guests.

This hotel was very chic and had an eclectic, artsy feel to the decor. The room we stayed in was an upgraded room with a king sized bed draped in beautiful linens and curtains. Our windows overlooked the canal. The hotel was beautiful and we had a very comfortable stay. A couple of things that we loved and didn't like so much: Loved: 1. The room and decor 2. The views! 3. Breakfast in the morning...first taste of a bombolone...a vanilla cream filled ball of deliciousness coated with sugar...yum! 4. Location -- very close to Piazza San Marco and great shopping. Also, kind of \"off the beaten path\" and hidden away. Very romantic. Negatives: 1. No elevator -- not that big of a deal, but walking up 4 flights of stairs to get to your room after a long day of being left in venice was not ideal. 2. Construction -- there was some construction going on outside our room at one of the neighboring hotels or homes that woke us up early one morning. Not too happy about that considering the jetlag! 3. Bathroom -- was very small and tight. Plus, every time you ran the water in the sink or shower the pump would run. It was very loud and annoying, especially when showering. 4.

We had heard that Venice was a romantic place but were not expecting too much. The prices of all the hotels seemed high and the website for AD place convinced my wife to choose it. The instructions to the hotel were brilliant and we chose to take the AVTO direct bus from the airport Marco Polo to Piazzale Roma and then a public ACTV steamboat No1 to the stop of Giglio from which the hotel is a 2 min walk. This was the cheapest way and not too difficult. Total cost 9.5 euro each Venice is an extremely beautiful place and took our breath away. The views from the Grand Canal make you feel in awe of the place. Please ensure if you travel in winter to wrap up warm, take hats that cover your ears, do not forget your scarf and take wellies. Venice is land locked and the tide goes in and out. You will see the walkways flooded in the morning but not to worry they will clear by 12. The hotel is a boutique hotel with a lot of class. You will not be disappointed. There is no lift but you will get help to your room with the bags. The staff are excellent. The manager Allesandro is so helpful and always has a smile on his face. He will assist you with anything. I am a Muslim and he helped me with directions to a mosque for Friday prayer (steamboat to Piazzale Roma and the a no 6/ bus to Panorama, get off, take a left and follow the crowd). His right hand man Endo who serves breakfast also was good with the banter and assistance with anything. The night manager Kamal also did a stand up professional and friendly job. He served tea, recommended restaurants and places to go out. We at no point could complain with the service or facilities at this hotel. We had a superior room (the purple picture) on the same floor as the breakfast area. There was a view of the canal where the people were dropped off at the Opera House for the show and we could hear the music. The decor was a flat screen TV, iPod dock and velvet covered everything else. It felt like the room was in a palace and my wife felt like a queen for those 4 days. There was even a fresh rose on a holder in the mirror and fresh fruit laid out on arrival. We were offered champagne but refused as we do not drink. The room was cleaned properly sometimes twice a day and toiletries were a plenty. Anything you want is served quickly and efficiently. We were served tea with different cakes and biscuits every day in our room at about 5.30pm and the fare was of the highest standard. Breakfast was continental with eggs also on offer. At each stage in respect of food you could not fault the quality as everything was fresh and they had tea bags from Scotland. On one night we were served fresh blueberries, raspberries, satsumas on a plate surrounded by flowers. In terms of sightseeing I suggest you do not buy the day pass for the steam boat as you will not need it. You can walk everywhere with St Marks Square 5 minutes from the hotel and Rialto (famous bridge) just a bit more. The walks are enchanting (signposted well) as the streets are narrow with little bridges covering the canals everywhere and beautiful architecture at every turn. You must get a hotel near to the square otherwise you will regret it. We did not have much time so on one day saw the Doge palace, St Mark's church and museums which were all included in the 12 euro ticket. On the other days we relaxed, went for a gondola ride (you have to go on one in Venice) and went to the included glass factory tour. Please bear in mind the glass factory pays for your water taxi there and then you have to make your own way back. The items at the glass factory are very expensive and the sales people are pushy so look out. one evening we saw a concert with 7 violins which warmed the heart on a frosty evening. Venice was better than I expected. It is rich not only in the way it looks but also the delicious food. We concentrated on Pizzas and pastas of which there are plenty. Food is not cheap and expect for 2 to pay 30-40 euro for each meal at least and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s without alcohol. I can highly recommend the Rosa Rossa restaurant which is quite close to the hotel where I had an exquisite seafood risotto which the chef made to my specification. The atmosphere was delightful as was the quality. All in all a brilliant trip made all the more better by one of the best hotels we have stayed at and we have stayed at a lot. I was not surprised that it is so high on the popularity index. You get what you pay for and I felt we got more than what we paid for which is a refreshing surprise.

Hip, sleek, sexy and a lot of fun, all enhanced by the spectacular service of the staff, who are warm, knowlegable and engaging (thank you, Alessandro!! et al!!). Some days it was just hard to decide between staying tucked into the luxury of this stunnning boutique hotel or evnturing our into spectacular Venice. Some of the icing on the Ad PLace cake is the charming rooftop oasis, the perfect place for enjoying the sweeping views of the city and having an afternoon glass of wine or your morning coffee. Another big plus is a lush and generous breakfast buffet on the top floor - - included in the price of your room.
