The area is shabby, so it's not an attraction to go around after prolonged meeting. 4 stars hotel does not have swimming pool, spa, pool table. The meals were quite poor, little selection of everything, no fruit, no tea, for hot breakfast there was an omelet once in four mornings! Rooms are clean, but ac system does not work even in meeting room. I have found nor kettle, neither single glass or cap (even plastic) in my room for four nights stay. Reception people are extremely unpleasant except of blond one (seems to be Laura). They pretend to be very busy and you have to wait for their attention for a long-long time.

We had a large room and we all had separate beds and they were quite comfortable. The bathroom was also of a decent size. We had a bit of trouble finding the hotel at first though due to the sign at the entrance being tiny and the sign at the top of the building is for something completely different. The free parking and nice new TV were great bonuses. I'd read that it was far from the centre of Rome but it isn't as bad as I was expecting. Just a short walk down a few roads (max 20 mins) to a Metro train station which takes you really quickly into the centre. The train was only 4\u20ac for an entire days use which we thought was great value. The breakfast (which was included) was nice but due to the amount of peeps it all disappeared quite quickly. Luckily the amazing staff members were around to continue bringing out more food. One of the staff members was generally amazing and was so awake, cheerful and polite it was really infectious and a great way to start the day.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT stay in this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Mr_DLR", "ReviewID": "UR105328610", "Content": "During a 10 day stay in Italy, my wife and I and another couple booked a room for one night that we were told would sleep four. Well, instead of two double beds or even a double bed and sleeper couch, we got what we were told- four walls (a room) with four literal cots, a desk, and a 20 year old television. The walls were dull eggshell color and were scuffed and damaged. The bathroom was tiny. We complained that this was unacceptable, but were told there were no more rooms. About 30 min. later we got a call that they had found another room. This room was the same size, however recently renovated. The bathroom was much larger and it had a flat screen TV. However, the sleeping situation was still deplorable. Somehow they define cots as \"beds\". There were two singles and one full size double. They barely sat 12 inches off the floor. It is evident that this building was originally office or even industrial space that someone has tried to convert to a hotel. This results in atleast two two-foot diameter concrete columns invading each room. In addition to the aesthetical shortcomings, you must take a bus to get to the subway to get into town-very inconvenient location! In spite of the foregoing, the staff was polite and courteous, but this did not make up for the overall poor experience we had while staying in this \"hotel\".", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "italy", "Title": "\u201creally disappointed at this time\u201d", "Author": "mrdj", "ReviewID": "UR89673651", "Content": "This is my fourth time staying this hotel, but they have a room preferation problem.

I had a big, clean room with a clean bathroom, the breakfast was great and the public transport was good as well. The trip from the hotel to the city center takes about 35-45 minutes and costs 1 E.
