It was actually the first stop from the airport which was nice because we got in right away in the morning during busy traffic. We stayed on the 8th floor in a king bedroom room and it was fine for what we needed in Sydney. We were only in our room to sleep so it was just fine. I didn't hear the traffic noise that other reviewers wrote about but I was able to hear the people in the room next to ours. The shower was a bit annoying being that the water went all over the floor in the bathroom but there was a drain for it to go into and it was designed that way so it wasn't a big deal. We opted to not have our room cleaned every day we were there because we were unsure of how safe that would be. We did run into the lady that serviced our floor several times and she offered us fresh towels each morning which was perfect for us. We were a little annoyed with the internet (they said they had just switched carriers) and we were only able to use it in the lobby. You were allowed 3 hours of service a day and we went to the lobby with our laptop to send emails, etc. I guess you can't complain much being that it was FREE. The location was the best part of the hotel! It was close to Darling Harbour and we walked there every day. We bought the 24 hour ferry hopper pass that included the Taronga Zoo and we would recommend this to anyone! We also tried the Thai restaurant a block away on the same street (name of it is slipping my mind but you will see it right away) and it was delicious! We took a suggestion from someone in the hotel for a good restaurant in China Town being that we were so close and it was authentic chinese. It was good but not what we were expecting. We were able to get to Grand Central Station quickly and hopped a short train to the airport on our way out of Sydney. I would stay here again for the price and location!", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cgoing down in standard\u201d", "Author": "personalchoice", "ReviewID": "UR127634893", "Content": "Having stayed regularly at this hotel due to its location to Central Station.I was dissapointed as the standards have dropped and the front desk staff seem unable to solve the smallest of problems.(especially the Choice Hotels rewards programm) , telling me they were not trained etc.The room I complained about, not properley cleaned , old soap scum on floor of shower from previous guest.

Easy to reach from the airport train and the bus stops are about 100 metres in George St. About a 20 minute walk to Darling Harbour through China Town. The price was reasonable for what was offered.

From the minute that we walked into The Marque Hotel, we were stunned by how much we had been deceived, based on the appearance and description of the hotel on its website. It is true that the hotel is somewhat centrally located in the southern region of Sydney; it is about a 15 minute walk from Darling Harbour, which has many shops and delicious restaurants, but it is located in the center of Chinatown, and if you are not interested in eating Asian food, you should expect to walk a good 15-20 minutes to either Darling Harbour. Our initial impression of the room was that it was a decent size and that it had the amenities that we were looking for. When we entered the room, it took us about 15 minutes to figure out how to even turn on a light; you must insert your room key into the wall in order to operate the lights and the air conditioner, but there are no directions whatsoever to explain to this to you. After our 22 hour trip from the US, all we wanted to do was take a shower. When we did, we were quickly alarmed with the noise that the shower was making. The website describes that each room has a rain shower, so we were excited to use it, but within a minute of doing so, the shower head was making a ridiculous noise that sounds similar to drilling. We brought this issue to the front desk, who offered to send up a maintenance worker. When we arrived at our room, he looked at the shower and after we told him to wait a minute or so while the water ran, he not only told us that were wasting water, but that the sound wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem. He said that it was most likely the sound of air exiting the shower head, and that it should go away within a minute or so. Let me tell you, we have been here for almost a week, and the sound has not only been a part of every shower that we have taken, but the water pressure and temperature changes along with the noise. The maintenance worker did not offer to come back if the sound persisted, and the front desk did not even bother to follow up with this issue. For a hotel that promises a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soothing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153divine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rain shower experience, I feel as if I have been taking a shower in a thunderstorm for the past few days. If you are bringing important belongings (jewelry, passports, electronics), expect to be using a safe behind the front desk. There are no safes in the rooms, but they do offer personal safes at no cost if you wish to secure your items up front. The boxes are small though, so be aware that you can fit no more than a few small items within them. I am not sure how safe I actually feel putting my important personal items behind the reception desk, considering there have been multiple occasions in which we have been in the lobby where the desk was left unattended. The website states that the hotel offers Foxtel and Satellite television, and although that may be true, do not expect more than 3-6 channels. I must say though, I am happily surprised that the hotel offers free, 24 hour internet access, and that they provide an Ipod docking station and refrigerator for your convenience. On the other hand, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peep hole\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the door, so we were not comfortable opening the door when hotel staff came to the room. We actually put our ironing board against the door at night because we were unsure of how well the door was locking since it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a normal lock. If these issues weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough to turn you off from staying at this hotel, you will be unhappy to hear that the staff here is not only completely incompetent in providing solutions to any issues that are presented to them, but they have absolutely NO knowledge of anything within proximity to the hotel; they were unable to inform us of any restaurants, shops, excursions, etc. and there are limited brochures that are offered to guests when inquiring about things to do in the area. We eventually got fed up and booked the climb on our own within 5 minutes. We have had to go to multiple shops, restaurants, and even other hotels to ask about directions or suggestions on where to go. In my opinion, that is absolutely unacceptable to have to do when one is staying at a hotel that claims that they go \u00e2\u20ac\u0153above and beyond\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for their guests. When we tried to book our Bridge Climb excursion, one of the staff members did not know what the climb was, and he took about 45 minutes to try and book the excursion. We were going to confront the hotel staff at the end of our stay and discuss our unhappiness with our experience here, but after calling down for a bar of soap and being told that I had to go down myself and get it after 9pm, I had decided to express my concerns immediately. I was told that there is only one person at the desk and that any services that I needed after this time had to be taken care of on my own; I have never heard of this at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four-star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel. As I walked downstairs to get my soap, a couple had walked in, looking for a room to stay in at the hotel. After they had been turned away due to full occupancy, they decided to linger in the lobby and discuss their other options. At this point, I decided to bring up to the staff how disappointed I have been so far with the hotel. Not only did the staff member not address any of our concerns or offer any guidance or solutions, but he rudely tried to dismiss the couple when they overheard our concerns and tried to help us solve our problems; he told them to leave and that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to listen to them because they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staying at the hotel. This is an absolutely disgusting response from a person working in the hospitality industry. Little does he know that even though she isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staying at the hotel, she is probably telling everyone she knows not to stay here. On day 4, we finally met the manager of the hotel and we expressed our issues and concerns and even told him that we were considering switching hotels. He apologized sincerely and gave us complimentary breakfast for the rest of our stay. Although he accommodated us, I would stay not stay here again, or recommend the hotel to others. Because we live in the US, we were not able to call the hotel before arriving and inquire about the amenities because of costly expenses due to international fees. Therefore, we strongly relied on The Marque website in making our decision to stay here.

Walking distance to Paddinton Market for interesting shopping as well as awesome Asian food on the top floor .. check UAE money exchange as they won't rip you off and give you great exchange rate too!! Street car to Darling Harbour right by market too!! Staff very very helpful and will book shuttle back to International Airport .. cheaper than train too!! Breki is okay .. rooms have lots of space and free wifi was nice .. bathroom is a challenge as it is a boutique thingee with no shower door so you have to be quick so you don't flood the place .. did not like at all!! The overall cost of stay was too pricey but there are many over priced hotels in the Sydney area!!", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cCan't complain, nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "cam86nz", "ReviewID": "UR124457547", "Content": "We were staying here for a week recently.

It was a bit weird though in that there is no external window and no natural light. There was a window in the corner of very thick glass, after some judicious squinting it looked like that window opened onto another room. Not 100% sure on that, but it felt a bit odd. The overall feeling of the room was therefore a bit claustrophobic - I'd suggest asking for a room higher up or on the outside of the hotel.

We went to reception to see about changing rooms but were told the hotel was fully booked and to ask the following morning. We had paid extra to upgrade to an Executive Room which was described on the hotel booking reservation (we booked directly with the hotel) as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoffering a quiet sanctuary away from the busy cosmopolitan city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. All night all we could hear was cars, buses and trucks, the traffic noise was loud all night. When we went to the reception the next morning, I pointed out our request that we made back in July and also the description the hotel has about offering a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquiet sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The receptionist said that basically they did not take much notice of requests (I think they had totally ignored ours) and peoples interpretation of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquiet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 depends on what they are used to. I would argue that unless you live on a major road junction (see photo) in a main city, no one would call this a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquiet sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We were moved to a room on the side of the hotel, which was quieter but I would still not call it a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquiet sanctuary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I think someone in the Marketing Department who has never slept at this hotel has been very creative!! Now the good\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Convenient location close to central train station, so makes it easy to use public transport to get around Sydney. We did not hear any noise from the other rooms.

I am a light-medium sleeper and I had to resort to ear plugs whereas my husband normally doesn't hear anything and he woke 3/4 times during the night. Our room appeared to have a form of a noise barrier, with two separate lots of windows and a couple of inches between but they were absolutely ineffective. The noise absolutely spoilt a wonderful hotel, in a great location and friendly staff. I had also enquired on checking in that the programming for our card would be for the duration of our stay and was assured that it would be however, on our last night the cards mysteriously stopped working - they had been fine in the morning and not working in the afternoon.

To cut to the chase, the connecting door proved a huge impediment to a good night's sleep. The guests next door were watching tv and listening to music (there is an iPod dock) fairly loudly, and we could hear every single word and note that was said/sung! When you opened the connecting door (their door was locked) the sinus was even louder. There was no way we would be getting any sleep if this continued. So, we called reception. The night manager to whom we spoke was unhelpful. He said we should wait and see if they went to bed soon, and if they didn't, he would call them to inform them of noise complaints.

He replied, hotel was at capacity, we would just have to wait for them to be quiet. Surely not even one other room is available, we asked. To and fro like this. After many calls it was established that some pre-paid guests had not shown up (by this stage it was about 2330). My partner by thus stage was most frustrated and took the phone. He calmly but directly demanded something be done. Could it be that an authoritative, masculine voice got some action? (I am female) lo and behold, a room materialised on the 4th floor. Here is the clincher- when my partner went downstairs to collect the new keys (yes, that is rift, we even had do do that ourselves), he found out that the night manager had not even called the guests next door yet- this could perhaps have solved all the problems.

There were only 5 tables currently seated, and it looks like they would cater to about 20 tables in total, so not sure what the problem here was. Decided to try room service only to be told it will be at least 1-1.5 hours before food would arrive. I actually caught up with the waiter in the lift and he indicated he was the only person on, and that was the hold up. He was run off his feet, and indicated that this was not 'normal' but not 'unusual'. For a hotel that really features/publicises it's restaurant it is not a good experience at all. Management should have had the foresight to manage this situation, or at least have processes in place to ensure that someone else could help out. Chatted to the front desk and they do not have charge-back arrangements with any local restaurants (a simple mitigation to the lack of waiters in the restaurant). I should also mention that the front desk staff member took another 10 minutes to even start to help me as he was the only person on the desk and was on the phone, therefore unable to help me (again - why only one if they may spend that amount of time on the phone???). As a business traveller, the simple things like easy food arrangements and efficient service etc. are important, and for this reason I found the stay at the Marque very substandard.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austins Ferry", "Title": "\u201cExtremely convenient to everything!\u201d", "Author": "Squid24", "ReviewID": "UR57119770", "Content": "We loved this hotel, we stayed 8 nights and had no problems.

On reflection, the rate was probably not as good as I thought in terms of the room and the hotel. The room itself was quite sizeable and relatively well appointed. A proper king size bed, not just two singles pushed together, decent TV, mini-bar, iron and ironing board (helpful for the business traveller who needs to iron in the morning). Bathroom was ok, but the lack of door to the shower meant water did get out and everywhere on the floor. Water pressure in the sink was a bit weak as well. Room service was very limited in menu, and also only operating between 5:30 and 10:30pm. Internet was cripplingly expensive, but there is a dirt cheap internet cafe two doors down. My real issue, as with others, came at breakfast. A full breakfast was $22. For that price, I expect a decent spread of food. What i got was a quite limited selection. Only one serving of eggs was allowed, made fresh in the Kitchen (a point there I suppose, but if you wanted more eggs...tough). Limited selection of hot foods, limited choice of bread (white or wholegrain), only a couple of types of cereal, and a pathetically small pastry selection. Most disappointingly was the limit of one cup of tea/coffee per person. Breakfast was over by 9am, which didnt bother me much as a business traveller, but I saw a few leisure tourists, including those in town for the Masters Games a bit befuddled by being told no more breakfast at 9:15am. Good points: location was good, close to central station. Room was quite clean and the bed was comfortable, though the pillows were a bit thin. Bad points: Facing the road was a bit noisy. The Ipod docking station backlighting made the room quite bright when I was trying to sleep. That might sound a bit strange, but it really was very bright. I ended up unplugging it. All up, I found it to be little better than most motels Ive stayed in, and certainly not the value pick I thought it was.

We were very happy with our stay, thought it was great value for money and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mid priced hotel in a central location.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cValue for money, central location\u201d", "Author": "happyadventurers", "ReviewID": "UR18787909", "Content": "I took my son on his first plane trip to Sydney for the weekend and stayed 2 nights at the Marque Hotel. We were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed our stay, even after reading some not so pleasant reviews about the hotel. I booked direct and had an entainment gold card but decided to upgrade to the re-furbished rooms on the upper floors. So pleased I did, as we did get a peak of unfurbished rooms and yes, it was worth the extra $40 per night! We had a lovely clean room with a king size bed, flat screen tv with free movie channels. I have to say the best thing about the room was the shower, it was fantastic. The only negative thing I have to say is that the outside of the building looks very tired and old and has not yet been updated and the windows were very dirty, other than that we enjoyed everything. We did not venture far at night, but there were always lots of people about and everything we needed was nearby. We loved the free internet access on the laptops in the lobby of the hotel, my son was very happy. We found all the staff friendly and helpful, and yes, Marco is a great asset to the hotel. Breakfast was included in our package, but really found it very ordinary. My son enjoyed it though! Overall, we had a wonderful stay and yes, we would stay again.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSmall, smelly and NOT worth the money\u201d", "Author": "screename_schmeename", "ReviewID": "UR18589873", "Content": "I booked a so-called \"Premier King\" room for my husband and I for a weekend stay in Sydney.

The room we were given was tiny, with no windows. It was a non-smoking room, but definitely smelled of smoke and something else... probably mould considering there were no windows and no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Yes, it had a king size bed and was newly refurbished with flat screen tv, but that's it. It was definitely NOT somewhere we felt comfortable. I was looking forward to having somewhere to chill out after heading out on Saturday night, but I was actually dreading coming back to our tiny stinky room.

For Sydney accommodation in a good location, my $112 p.n. in a double room was excellent. The room itself was quite comfortable and the bathroom was clean and a good size. It was somewhat dated (they say they are refurbishing the premises now they are under the Marque banner), and being right at Central Station it was noisy. But, as I said above, for the price it was most acceptable. However, my initial goodwill towards the premises became somewhat diminished. I made the mistake of inviting my daughter to join me in the restaurant downstairs for dinner. We waited exactly an hour from the time we ordered our meal until it was served. There was nearly a mini-rebellion in the dining room. There were only about 10 of us altogether, but the waiter said they were very busy that night - hence the delay! Maybe they only had one chef and he was busy doing room service meals. When our meal did arrive, my daugher's meal was not as described on the menu, and the salad had black slimy lettuce leaves in it - and that was nothing to do with dressing, as we had ordered it without dressing. On returning to my room, I discovered the TV remote control didn't work properly, and when I decided to make myself a cup of tea, found the first mug in the cupboard had a crack in the rim, and the second mug had clearly a previous guest's mouth imprint on it. So overall it wasn't a happy experience and I would only ever stay here again if I needed (as I did on this occasion) cheap overnight accommodation due to an early morning appt. next day.
