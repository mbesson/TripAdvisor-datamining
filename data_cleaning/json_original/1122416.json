This hotel is adjacent to the Dolphin Mall and a number restaurants are located nearby and in the mall itself (P.F. Changs was pretty good). The rooms are spacious and clean--as one would expect from Marriott. The front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. Shower (with tub) was clean and hot water plentiful. So far so good--the problem with the hotel is in the details. There was no fridge in the room, and though there was a coffee maker, the hotel staff left only decaffeinated coffee, not the real stuff. There were complimentary coffee pots in the hotel lobby, but no coffee was available, at least on morning of departure. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was buffet style, but, again, no attention to details: there was no whole milk available, no chef at the eggs/omelette station, and to get refills on tea and coffee you had to chase the wait staff down. The main reason we rate this in the \"not-to-be-repeated\" category, though, is that on the morning of departure the in-room smoke alarm went off for no reason and, despite calls to front desk, no one showed up to shut it off after twenty minutes, at which time we could stand it no longer and beat a hasty (coffee-less) departure with the sound of the smoke alarm still ringing in our ears.

Often the cruise companies book you into more luxury hotels which are lovely but do not have shops and restaurants nearby and as you usually do not have a car for such a short stay we find this hotel is a much better option. My husband uses a wheelchair as he cannot walk any distance and nothing was too much trouble for the reception staff to make his stay as easy and pleasant as possible. They gave us a disabled room and made sure that it was as near as possible to the lifts. Crystal in particular offered to take us and collect us from the mall in the hotel shuttle so I had less distance to push the wheelchair which was a great help. They stored the luggage for us when we had to check out a couple of hours before leaving for the port and the airport and prebooked a suitable taxi vehicle for us which could take us, the luggage and the wheelchair which was greatly appreciated. On returning after the cruise we were very pleasantly surprised to find that we could check into the room early. The free screens in reception were great as we could check in on-line for our flight and I found that when I explained to the teenagers who were using them that all I needed to do was to check in they offered to come off line for a few minutes for me which was appreciated. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable and although there can be some airport noise it did not bother us at all. We appreciated the free coffee on offer in reception and once when it had run out the reception staff brought us cups of coffee from the kitchen.

Our room was beautiful! Very nice beds. Lots of room for the 3 of us. My son liked the pull out sofa. The bathroom makes you feel like you are in a spa with nice toiletries provided. The staff is very nice and friendly. We wallked across the parking lot to the PF Chang's and shopping. The Dolphin Mall is huge. My husband said we needed a day just to be able to see all of the mall. It was nicely decorated for the holidays. They even had a live band playing. http://www.shopdolphinmall.com/ If you are a fan of the discount chain Ross, you won't be disappointed with the one at the mall. It has a great selection. There are also other stores such as Coach, Versace, Sony for electronics. The hotel loby has two computers for you to use for free. The lobby also has a beautiful aquarium. We didn't eat there for breakfast as we ate at the mall since it was sooo convenient. Very nice pool with towels provided. Nice fitness room with updated equipment.The only downfall is that there is no shuttle available except within a 5 mile radius around the hotel. You don't need a shuttle to the mall as it is right across the parking lot. It cost us $60. to get to the port the next day and $30 from the airport which is a bit pricey for transportation.

The lobby was nicely done, with new features, spacious lounging areas and the breakfast bar. The hotel cleanliness is something of a standard I've come to expect from Marriott and this location was no exception. The hotel was clean inside and out and I had absolutely no complains about its condition. The buffet-style breakfast is standard fare- warm eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, cereal and a variety of fruits, yogurts and Starbucks coffee. Overall a great way to start your day and so conveniently prepped for you. The location of the hotel is strategic on a couple of levels. For starters, the hotel sits on the parking lot of one of Miami's largest shopping malls- The Dolphin Mall. If you anticipate doing any shopping on your trip, this hotel could not be more conveniently situated. The mall proximity also offers you a couple of other benefits, such as a plethora of casual eateries and sit-down restaurants, including TGIFridays, PF Changs and a Brazilian Steak House called Texas de Brazil. If you want to turn a regular night into a fun night, the mall also offers the option of the Cinebistro, which is a movie and dinner experience offering you the option of fine dining and cuisine in a theater setting. This is a fun place for a date night and it is within walking distance of the Courtyard. If you opt not to walk, you can take advantage of one of the many city cabs waiting at the cab lot on the mall parking lot...very convenient if you need to catch a cab back to the hotel. Also, the hotel and the mall sit adjacent to the Florida Turnpike, with easy access to the north and south. Surrounding roads also take you into the heart of Miami in minutes and the airport is a short 15 minute drive away. All in all, this hotel satisfied all the requirements for my stay.

A great place for that \"pre-vacation\" shopping time . .", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ctsblue", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Little Courtyard next to the Mall\u201d", "Author": "ctsblue", "ReviewID": "UR22152618", "Content": "I recentley stayed at this Hotel because my Company recommended it. After a red-eye flight from the west coast I was just so happy to reach my destination. I got to the Hotel early and received a very warm welcome. I was just going to ask if I could store my luggage till later and go to work and the girls at the front desk gave me an early check-in. I am so used to \"check-in time is 3pm\", It was a nice surprise. Got upstairs to my room and it looked great, smelled new and was super clean. I took a shower in their beautiful bathroom and headed to work. When I returned I asked where I should go for dinner. They gave me a list of Restaurants and an Italian place that delivers right to your Hotel room(used them later in the week). The Sales Manager / Director was there and she was so sweet. She went to her office and came back with a discount booklet full of deals for the Dolphin Mall. They were all so great. The breakfast servers were SUPER. The High Speed Internet was good and FREE. You really feel welcomed at this Hotel and that is great being away from home. I can't wait to return! The only thing that I didn't like is there is not a shuttle to and from the Airport. The taxi was $30.00 each way.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turku, Finland", "Title": "\u201cVery good\u201d", "Author": "Lumihiutale", "ReviewID": "UR22148238", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights in the Courtyard Marriott Dolphin Mall, booked through hotel's own website. Main purpose of the stay was to have a decent place to sleep and relax between flights - no needs for entertainment, pool, restaurant services, etc. but definitely for clean, secure, quiet, comfortable room. This hotel met our expectations very well. As the entire hotel is non-smoking, this was a big plus for us. Our room had 2 queen beds, very comfortable, selection of pillows ready in the room. Plenty of closet space, desk for working, small living area with chairs and table, one corner equipped with coffee making facilities. Bathroom had shower and bathtub combination. The room had a balcony overlooking to the Dolphin Mall / parking area, parking in front of the hotel was free. Everything in the room and in the hotel was clean and well maintained. Complimentary wireless internet connection in the room was good and worked without problems. Self-service laundry and dryer were available: 1$ per use, worked perfectly. Breakfast buffet in the lobby restaurant offered good variety of items, fresh and nicely presented. However, as noted by previous reviewer, there was wide gap between the skills of the egg station ladies: first day was just perfect with great service, second day was only fair with minimum service. Breakfast was not included into the room rate, but was reasonably priced. Service in the hotel/reception was very good. Our luggage did not arrive with us and the hotel provided dental kit, deodorant and razor kit - immediately and free of charge. During our stay all our questions were promptly responded and all the staff were polite with us. What should be noted is that there is no fridge or microwave nor safe in the room. However, safety deposit box is provided in the reception (free of charge), and it is easy to access any time. However, only a couple of boxes are big enough for laptop computers. If you need a room in quiet location, request it - noise from the hallway comes through the door.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cayman Islands", "Title": "\u201cgood enough\u201d", "Author": "dlareme", "ReviewID": "UR21783088", "Content": "Convient hotel, Courtyard standards but Undertrained staff.

The hotel is very clean, the rooms are very nicely decorated with really comfy beds, flat screen TVs, and good quality sheets and towels. Very good value for money. The staff were super friendly and couldn't do more to help - especially the waiting staff at breakfast, and at check-in. I chose this hotel for it's proximity to the airport and for it's location at the Dolphin Mall as I was only in the States for one night. A taxi from the airport will cost you just under $30 but I found a taxi willing to take me to the airport for a flat rate of $20. There's also a return shuttle bus between the airport and mall which is $10 for a return ticket, but it only goes every couple of hours.
