The included breakfast is basically eggs, toast, pancakes and cereal...again basic but acceptable. Rooms are clean, spacious and inoffensively decorated. The shower is excellent. Would we stay here again? Of course as long as prices are kept below $120 a night...Room tip: ask for a room that doesn't overlook the pool as this area can be noisy.

It was easy to find. Check-in went smooth. The beds were awesome! I hate hotel beds, but this one was one of the best. The bathrooms were great too, very up to date. I always had hot water! Coming from a house that lives off of a small water heater, it was soooooo nice to take a 20 minute HOT shower! We had a great view of the city, every few minutes an airplane would fly right by. No noise at all. The only noise that I heard was the trolly, but it stopped when we went to sleep. The only thing that could have been a problem was the elevator. They are updating their elevators, so only one is in use. We left and came back to the hotel when there wasn't many people there so we didn't have many issues. But I would assume that during check-in and check-out hours it'll be a little difficult to get to a higher room floor. So if you are going there soon, call and see if there elevator is still under matinee. If so ask if you can get a first floor room. It'll be great when both can be used! My one complaint is the parking, The parking garage was a very very tight fit. It was also $10 a day! If you do pay for parking make sure your little tag is visible, ours fell down and we got a ticket. They did have a complimentary breakfast. It was just okay. They had good potatoes, onions, and pastries. Otherwise it was just okay. The rooms have a pretty large mini fridge, so if you can find a grocery store I would stock up. Great stay.

If you stay here request a room facing the harbor front and a room that is high up....you will get the best of what the hotel has to offer. I saw those rooms as housekeeping were cleaning them and had the doors left open! The hotel does have some renovated rooms and I would definately request one of those. While I was there the pool was not in operation. Close walk to the ocean front which was nice. Not many nice restaurants in the area and the food at the hotel itself isnt that great!

Besides visiting the conference, we wanted to do some sightseeing and shopping. For this purpose, the hotel was just perfect. It is located just a few steps from the bay promenade, along which one could walk either to the convention center wihtin 20mins or so, and also into the city (the shorter way to the city and shopping areas such as Horton Plaza is straight through the city and does not even take 10mins). Check-Inn upon arrival was fast and friendly. Not over-friendly as some might know from 4- or 5-star hotels...but on the other hand, I did not want to become friends with the receptionists ;-) and they were nice enough to make us feel fine. The room (and we \"only\" had a standard room) was spacious with two huge queen beds and a lovely view to the Star of India sailship. Very clean, nice bathtub with shower included, which had a good water pressure. We also appreciated the coffee machine in the room, which helped especially during the first two days when we were still in a jet-lag. ;-) The wireless internet was sometimes a bit slow and my colleague was kicked out the net a few times, but on the other hand, it is free (try to get free internet throughout european hotels...good luck!) and overall worked good enough to check e-mails and do things such as skype. Some people mentioned the trains blowing their horns all night...well, yes, you can hear them once in a while, but we thought that the sound-proof windows did a good job and both had a decent sleep all week. What might be more of a problem if you have a light sleep or get disturbed easily is a room on one of the lower floors facing the pool. Another colleague was on the 3rd floor and said he could hear the pool generator (or whatever it was) quite clearly. To have breakfast, you have to walk out the hotel a few metres to the left and step into the adjoining restaurant. Not a big problem in sunny and warm April. Breakfast itself was ok...as always in the USA, way too sweet. ;-) But with choices of bread and scrumbled eggs, butter, jelly and several kinds of cereals, two or three kinds of juice, coffee (even decaf) and some (for our taste rather disgusting) kinds of oatmeal or porridge. Oh and of course pancakes and maple syrup. So overall and since it was included in the price, that was fine and enough to have a good start into the day.

AAA) place to stay in Downtown San Diego on a summer weekend--high season. It's located at the border between the financial district of downtown and the lively residential/restaurant area of Little Italy. As previous reviewers have pointed out, the hotel is within blocks of the Amtrak/Coaster station and the Trolley, as well as the main bus spine on Broadway. Since I was staying without a car access to all this transit--as well as the many places I could walk to--was important. Some previous reviewers commented that there were a lot of homeless people around. Maybe I'm just habituated to it, but it didn't seem like a lot to me--maybe a couple on each walk near the hotel. There were areas of the Downtown, particularly around City College, that seemed to me to have a much stronger presence of street people. I disliked the fact that in the downtown direction there weren't many people of any kind around on the weekend, and that there were an awful lot of parking lots to walk by (hopefully a few more highrise condos will get built and get rid of some parking lots!). I was initially put into a low floor (4th) smoking room despite asking for a high floor non-smoking room. The desk folks said they were completely booked Friday night, but at my request on Saturday moved me to a non-smoking room on the 11th floor. Well done. The breakfast seemed pretty hopeless, like so many hotel breakfasts are. There are a lot of more interesting places to eat in San Diego. You get either a city view or a bayside view from any room, since the hotel is built with two lines of rooms on either side of a double loaded corridor. It makes for an ugly building outside but good views, though on the west side you've got to get over the parking structure. There were a lot of young people staying there--as well as foreign tourists--but they seeemed to quiet down late at night. I closed the door to my balcony--the room's \"window\"-- to cut down noise late at night. Contrary to what's been said, there is a pause in train service in the middle of the night, but only from about 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. The room's decor was fine, but not particularly notable.

One literally needs to do either of the following if one plans to driving to the Bayside. The first option is to drive a Toyota Corolla, a Honda Civic, or a shorter/narrower vehicle. The second option is to come in a car that has a disabled person's placard or license plate. This entitles the driver to park on the structure's ground level, where the designated spaces actually allow for a large pick-up or SUV. Moreover, one needs to be prepared to walk up and down stairs if parked on the second or higher level. There is no elevator. Neither is the ground-level door to the stairwell locked from the outside.

It certainly isn't a luxurious large scale hotel like the ones near the convention center, but it suffices for downtown convenience. The decor is somewhat outdated as the building appears to be from the early 80s, and the rooms tend to be somewhat shaded and dark as there is a neighboring bank building attached and blocking sunlight. There is still a nice bayview on one side, although as another review mentioned, there is a condo site that will eventually block the view. (So far there is no construction going up as yet.) They were nice enough to give us a bayview room even though we had not requested it. The rooms are a standard size, clean, and the queen size beds were above average IMO for comfiness thanks to a nice mattress pad. The microwave and fridge are convenient, and the clean if non luxurious bathroom has a hairdryer and coffeemaker. Water pressure was weak though for the shower. The location is very good, only a block from the nicest Rite Aid I have ever seen on Kettner and India St, and only a block and a half from the trolley stop that goes to the Gaslamp District (which is also walkable, but a long walk.) The area is safe and clean and right near good eats in Little Italy, and very close to the airport. The train line/trolley line passes next to the bay a couple blocks away and is somewhat noisy, but not enough to wake me from sleep. It might bother very light sleepers though. (It seems the noise is not as bad as with other similar budget hotels like Hampton Inn that are right next to the train line.) The parking is convenient and only $7 a night in a small unattended garage attached to the hotel, so you can come and go as you please. I found plenty of spaces available when I was there, so I didn't have the issues that others have noted finding a space. I didn't find the garage scary or weird either, it was open air and you could just walk down the ramps directly and roll bags along it because it was small.(there is no elevator) A compact car is easier to park given the size of the spaces. The included breakfast coupon is for a continental breakfast at an attached restaurant with sit down service, so you still have to pay tip. There is also a full menu so you can have a more substantial breakfast if you want, and the food was okay. Overall, this is a good value, full service hotel with a convenient downtown location. Staff were all pleasant and cordial. They made a small error with my hotel bill, but had already corrected it themselves by the time I called about it. Make sure to request a nonsmoking room when you reserve, as the hotel does still have smoking rooms too.

It also didn't recognize or wouldn't allow me access to commonly used websites and got messages about the page may be pornographic,even though they were not.

The price is great,and by no means is this the worst hotel in the world.Just in downtown San Diego it's either cheaper hotels that have their issues,such as this one and the Holiday inn on the Bay,or really nice,expensive hotels like the W or Sheraton.There doesn't appear to be a median hotel.

The hotel was in a great location, perfect for people who didn't have a car there, like us. They have a free \"shuttle\" to and from the airport- more like a minivan with a crazy driver!! All you have to do is call the hotel once you have picked up your bags at the airport and they come in 10 minutes or so. The hotel is pretty standard issue hotel chain quality, although the furniture was fairly new. The room itself was HUGE- we had a king size bed, a couch, coffee table, table w/ 2 chairs, a desk, and a chair w/ ottoman. Plus the room has a mini-fridge and microwave that came in handy for leftovers! We requested an upper floor, per other tripadvisor suggestions, and ended up on the 12th floor so we were all most at the top (14 floors total- expect 14 is really the 13th- stupid superstitions!) We did not pay for the bay view, but our view of the city was great. The balcony is super small, but we liked being able to leave our door open and get fresh air. There is construction surrounding the hotel, and within a short period of time, there will no longer be any bay view rooms. The price of the hotel is reasonable, especially compared to other downtown hotels. We were only 3 blocks from the bay, walking distance to the USS Midway Museum, Seaport Village, and the Gaslamp Quarter. We did not use the hotel pool- it was kind of chilly, but I can tell you that it is not the kind of pool you relax by all day. This is definitely a city hotel! There is a \"free\" breakfast, but you have to go to the Bayside Cafe, which is attached to the hotel, and be seated. You can either get cereal (hot or cold) w/ toast & coffee/tea, or a bakery item (bagel, danish) with juice or coffee/tea. For a small fee you can add on eggs and fruit- we did it one day & it's a lot of food!! Only complaint is that you have to wait for food, and we were eager to get out of there and start the day. The hotel is just blocks from the Cruise Ship Terminal, and the ferry to Coronado Island. We also took advantage of the public Trolley system, which is just a few blocks from the hotel. If you go, visit Karl Strauss Brewery- a block from the hotel, and home of a well-known and enjoyed beer in the San Diego area- good food too!! Not far from the hotel is the Kansas City Barbeque- famous for it's part in Top Gun- Stop by and eat there! The food is great, and it hasn't changed since Tom Cruise was there in 1985!! We also took advice from fellow tripadvisor's and went to Rite Aide to stock up on drinks & that we kept in the room. Overall San Diego is a wonderful city, and this is a great place to stay and see all the sights. We went to the USS Midway Museum, the Zoo, Sea World, Sea Port Village, Old Town San Diego, Coronado Island, etc. It's a great city to see, and the weather is PERFECT!!!", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Helpful Staff\u201d", "Author": "Livitup46", "ReviewID": "UR7301073", "Content": "My daughter & I spent four nights at the BW Bayside Inn last week.

The jets in the hot tub weren't operating properly & the elevators were a bit slow (unsure if both were working all of the time) but all in all, we were most pleased & would return. The free breakfast is beverage & muffin, but you can add eggs & fruit for $3.50. An easy walk to Little Italy, the harbor, trolley stop & Santa Fe Depot. A bit further (but definitely manageable) to Seaport Village & the Gaslamp. If you're looking for a day trip, we recommend a coaster train to Carlsbad Village ($11 rt).

I had booked thru AAA and failed to specifically request a non-smoking room. That was my fault. The reservation was actually for a city view, but we got a harbor view instead (not complaining) and that kinda made up for being on the smoking floor. We were also just staying for one night before we went to the airport, so smelling the smoke from room next door was tolerable. Pros - 1. The harbor view really is very nice, and the Star of India (about three blocks away, I think) is not blocked at all by other buildings. We arrived just before sunset and it was beautiful setting over the harbor. 2. It is less than a 5 minute drive to the airport. 3. It is walking distance to the harbor area and Little Italy. 4. The parking was 7.00/night. From what I've read, this is fairly reasonable for downtown. And it's right next door. 5. I thought the breakfast at the Bayside Grill next door was just fine, with the vouchers. Coffee was only listed with our option of cereal/milk and toast, but when we asked for juice for our daughter, he brought us all a juice at no charge (in addition to our coffee.) Also - the coffee was very good, and my husband and I are really picky about our coffee. We always bring our won for the room coffeemaker. 6. AAA rate for our room was 129/night. Not bad for a harbor view and breakfast. HOWEVER - Cons- 1. NOISY!!! OMG, even with the windows closed, it was sooo noisy. My 9 yr. old, who normally doesn't even notice urban noise, complained about it. The trolley runs by CONSTANTLY. The Amtrak ran by twice within the first 2 hrs we were there in the evening. A plane flew overhead - really close. The pool was right below our room at ground level - and although we were on the 9th floor, we still heard kids in the pool at 8pm. In the morning, we heard the cruise ships blowing their horns. This was with the windows closed. 2. The TV reception on the 9th floor was awful. ALL OF THE CHANNELS were fuzzy. Not one station was clear. Not one, out of thirty-something channels. 3. Our room was cramped and small, and our bed was uncomfortable - sagged in the middle. The first two, for me, far outweighed the pros, and I don't think I'd be happy staying at this place for a week, or even a few days. Maybe if I was really on a budget, but I would not want to be in the room for long, even if it was non-smoking. I would assume that a lot of hotels downtown and by the harbor would be noisy, but I haven't stayed at those, just this one, and, even with the view, I wasn't that impressed.", "Date": "April 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cOnly Ok....\u201d", "Author": "TravelerS7", "ReviewID": "UR7009306", "Content": "stayed here for one night in March, and while it was ok as a place to sleep, I probably wouldn't return given all of the other choices nearby. The room was just ok, thought it was reasonably sized, with a big fridge, a big TV that didn't work (I didn't get in until late and was too tired to deal with it or to change rooms, so just didn't use the TV), two only moderately comfortable queen beds. Bathroom was a decent size but water pressure somewhat lacking. There is free wireless and it worked very well once I got the user name and password from the desk, which just took a phone call. The room was fairly quiet until construction started in the am, though I could hear some noise from the next room when they used the plumbing. I could also hear traffic noise, even on the 10th floor and with the balcony door closed. Cleanliness seemed to be average. The major problems: 1. PARKING! I am surprised none of the recent reviews mentioned this. I can only guess that the reviewers didn't have cars. There is a parking garage, and contrary to one recent review it is NOT free, though the $7 charge is fairly reasonable by big city standards. HOWEVER, the problem is that the garage is five stories tall, with NO elevator. By the time I arrived the only parking spaces left were on the top floor, so yes, I had to go up and down five flights of stairs, or walk through five levels of the garage, to get to or from my car. I wasn't warned about this by the desk when I checked in (there are three spaces near the lobby for check in but a big sign warns that you will be towed if you leave your car there for longer than 15 minutes), but I had to come back through the lobby to get to my room. Had they even warned me, I would have dropped my luggage in the lobby before driving up to the 5th floor (and then having to walk down five flights with the luggage.). Part of the issue here is that there is no bellman. You are on your own to deal with luggage. On top of that, there is low lighting and no security personnel in the garage, and the garage is very open to the streeet, so it felt a little bit uncomfortable walking through it alone, in addition to being tiring.(the hotel neighborhood isn't awful but it isn't the greatest in the world either). Finally, I wonder if the garage size is adequate for the hotel: the hotel certainly didn't seem very full, but I literally got the second to last space in the place. I wonder what they do if it fills up? Bottom line: this is a convienent location to walking and public transportation, so might be ok for those without cars, but NOT recommended for those with cars. 2. The Elevator: (in the hotel itself): Signs on the elevator said it was working only sporadically, and if it stopped or the door wouldn't close to call the desk on the elevator phone. It worked for me, but this was very disconcerting. The sign said it was 'safe, but a computer issue'. Not particularly reassuring, especially since I notice in prior reviews that it has been broken before. 3. Construction: this was mentioned by others. There was major construction both on the street right below my room, and a new building being built right next door. By 7:00 am, the noise was significant (fortunately I had an early flight). 4. Bayside view: I didn't have a bayside view, so I will have to take the word of others that they are worth the extra $$ charged for it (which is why I didn't take it). However, I am skeptical, and if you do pay extra for it, better get an upper floor: I looked right at some bayside view room balconies from the 5th floor of the garage (which is bayside from the hotel), and could see the same view they were seeing: a bit of bay, framed by three larger hotels in between me and the bay (and of course, they were also looking at the garage). In addition to that, the new building being constructed next door juts out in an L shape from the bayside of the hotel, so EVERY bay view room is going to have a view of a construction site to their right. (the new building being built is about the same height as the hotel). Just a warning not to expect too much. II was glad that I hadn't paid extra for it. In that regard, while I know nothing about the Holiday Inn up the street, it might be worth checking out for those who want views: since it blocks part of the Bayside's view I presume its view is much better!. 5. Pool: is in a very claustrophobic little courtyard; nothing special about it. I could deal with these negatives as I was only there one night, but all of them would really have started to grate on a longer stay.
