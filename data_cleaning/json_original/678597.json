They remembered my name and said, \"Hello\" or \"Good Morning\" every time they saw me. The housekeepers don't disturb your belongings but clean the room very well. The reason I have marked this location as average is because of their internet and cell service. The wireless internet is terrible. It could not be slower. Trying to get work down is extremely frustrating. Also, the cell phone connectivity is just as terrible. I am not sure if the local terrain plays a factor in that or not, but the hotel really needs a cell repeater to boost the signal. I lost service many times in the conference room with my iPhone.

Our room with 2 queen beds was relatively spacious. We were there when there was a scheduled blackout at night (electric company-planned), for which the management held an evening party with free drinks and snacks, and for which they provided flashlights. There are cookies at front desk every night. The room had microwave and refrigerator with counter, and a large-ish desk, which enabled us to buy supplies and make our own delicious breakfasts every morning (breakfast not being included in the room price). There is room service provided by Bistro 39, the hotel restaurant, which we did not use for any meals, so I cannot rate the food. One of our relatives has used the Serenity Spa at the hotel and liked it, but we didn't use it, so again, I cannot rate it. The pool is heated, a big plus in the winter in San Diego. I prefer booking at this level of hotel, if the place is clean and well-maintained, rather than at a more expensive one, because the rooms are basically the same; and Hilton Garden Inn, like many hotels of its level, provides free wi-fi. Hotel is a 5 minute drive south of the bigger hotels (such as Marriott, Doubletree), and I would recommend this to anyone staying in the Del Mar area.

The rooms were clean & quiet, service was friendly, and the breakfast was really good (and free-one of the perks for being a HHonors member). Free parking and free wifi was nice, though it was impossible to find parking late at night and probably due to it being a long weekend with many travelers to San Diego. I ended up parking at the \"no parking zone\", as directed by the hotel staff. The only negative about this hotel (and perhaps it is so since it's a \"Inn\") is the a/c wall unit. It tends to be a little loud since all of the plumbing is built into the unit, unlike the central airconditioning system.

There is also another Garden Inn in Carlsbad where I have had a very nice experience. As a local, let me encourage you to check out other options before staying at this hotel. First off, the employee at the front desk was completely disinterested. Checked in, keys in hand felt like I had somehow inconvenienced her. Okay no worries, shrug it off... she's having a bad day. There was an event going on during our stay, I don't know if it was a wedding, or a dance etc but we were right above it! The music was thumping away under our feet and I was watching the water in my glass vibrate like the scene from Jurrassic Park. I understand, someone has to have that room, they can't shut down an entire event just for us, so I waited to see if the music had calmed down a bit by the time we got back from dinner and drinks. Seeing that my T-Rex glass was still in full motion, I called down to the front desk and asked them about it. It was 9:30, 10- I didn't asked to be moved but I was told \"Well, we have an event going on, its too late to move you ma'am.\" I didn't asked to be moved!!! But right there I was pretty much being told that I had no options and I should just deal with it. I went downstairs to see if I could get in touch with someone else at the front desk. I had to wait several minutes before letting them finish their trash talking session about management and how they couldn't wait to get off. There was another customer who walked up while I spoke with the employee. He listened to me ask about what time they thought the event would be winding down, and relay how the other team member made me feel brushed off. I didn't want to be moved I just wanted it noted somewhere that maybe the next time you put someone in that room, tell them that things were going to be loud. I know that if they had said \"look, we only have this room open and its going to be a little loud, we apologize in advance.\" Or \"look, here's a complimentary bottle of asprin for your anticipated sleepless night.\" lol The guest made some snide comment about how he couldn't hear anything from his room and \"it is what it is\". to which the man behind the desk laughed and said \"exactly!\" i'm pretty sure my jaw dropped to the floor.

There were a few situations that they went above and beyond our expectations and made our experience really feel more like a resort than the a typical hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel!", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay if you are in Sorrento Valley/Mira Mesa on business\u201d", "Author": "Brent C", "ReviewID": "UR82082656", "Content": "I stay at this hotel frequently on business (at least 5 nights a month), and continue to be amazed at the quality of service provided by this little Hilton Garden Inn. It is a bit difficult to get to from the 5 or 805 freeways, and it is a little off the beaten path (not many options around for interesting dinner or entertainment without driving down to La Jolla or out to Del Mar). However, the restaurant and bar are both fantastic full service options, and the staff is consistently gracious and helpful. If you are staying here, plan to have dinner at least one night during your stay at \"Bistro 39\" - you will be very surprised at the outstanding quality and presentation of the food, the reasonable prices, and the nice selection of wines available. I've stayed in probably just about every room in this hotel, and they don't vary much, so you don't need to stress out about getting \"just the right room\" for your stay. The rooms on the second floor facing the front of the hotel have little patios, which they seem to consider \"upgrades\" (as a HHonors Diamond member, I get these rooms a lot). The rooms themselves are the same other than the patio, however. If you are a smoker (which I am not) I suppose these rooms could be a nice bonus, since there is a little table and chairs with an ashtray out there. They offer a view of the parking lot and surrounding neighborhood, which is nothing special, (but better than some rooms I've had at other hotels with a view of a bunch of HVAC equipment or the neighboring restaurant's dumpster!) The rooms themselves are generous size, but not huge (maybe 400 square feet?) and have a microwave and small fridge along with a coffee maker. There's a sitting chair and a flat panel TV. My only gripe would be that the quality of the coffee in the room is pretty bad, but I'm a tea drinker and bring my own anyway. Generally the hotel is very quiet, since it is popular with business travelers - I see very few families or couples staying in the hotel. Internet access is all wireless and is suitable for emails and basic web surfing, but don't plan on downloading your HD iTunes movies while you are here - there isn't enough bandwidth. Generally, I can watch a Netflix streaming movie in reasonably good quality with only a few hiccups, but the caching process can take several minutes before the movie starts, since downloads seem limited to about 500kbps. Before discovering this hotel I was staying at a variety of other places in central Sorrento Valley, and all of them were more expensive and vastly inferior to the quality and service of this hotel. If you are a family looking for a place to stay in the area, It will be less expensive than similar accommodations in La Jolla, and probably only about 10 minutes' drive farther away. You'll also probably love the nice breakfast in the morning (two free if you are HHonors Gold or Diamond), which is a combo of self-service (waffles, fruit and cereal) and made-to-order items (eggs and such). The rooms are big enough to be comfortable for a few days with kids, but the they might be disappointed with the small pool that isn't terribly interesting.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fontana, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Kept Secret in San Diego Area\u201d", "Author": "Travelalldtime", "ReviewID": "UR81210706", "Content": "Great location- close to (less than 10 minutes by car) to beach, mall, torrey pines, la jolla, aquarium etc. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a relaxing and enjoyable weekend.

The hotel itself was very quiet, I never heard a peep from other guests our entire stay! Parking was free but sometimes hard to come by and spaces were a little tight (We have a full size SUV). The pool was small and the salon/spa looked out onto the pool area so my husband was not comfortable taking my daughter-he wished it had been a little more private. I'm sure if you are looking for more privacy it would be fine to use after the salon/spa closes for the day. Room service was excellent-both the service and food were great.
