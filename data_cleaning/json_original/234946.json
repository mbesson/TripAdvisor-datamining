The hotel is very easy to find and only 2 min walking from the metro station. The rooms are very tiny and the lights are very weak, but it's very clean and the beds are very comfortable. Since it's in a corner, it can be a little noisy so bring ear plugs to sleep at night and you are all set. I can say that this hotel has a great value for the money and I would definitely recommend to other people.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Castlemaine, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNoisy and hot\u201d", "Author": "Bolly27", "ReviewID": "UR72686141", "Content": "This hotel was very basic but clean and it's position makes it very easy to reach most of the sights you would wish to see in Berlin either on foot or by public transport. However this is the same reason that makes it very noisy - two tram lines meet virtually at the door, the train line is also very close and there is a Party Bar across the road. There is no airconditioning and the weather was very hot during our stay which meant we had the windows open throughout the night. Both the receptionists were most helpful when the TV needed adjustment and a hairdryer was requested. There are many eating places within close promixity which we enjoyed. This is an ok hotel if you are on a tight budget. We would probably choose a more comfortable hotel next time but in the same general area.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "rachyandy", "ReviewID": "UR68794007", "Content": "this hotel was fine for the money paid, rooms were clean, good location, easy to find from the metro. perfect for backpackers on a budget.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "LaskoSanJose", "ReviewID": "UR66137578", "Content": "The room is just like the pictures on website but we were still a bit surprised how tight the space was.

It is within easy walking distance to the train and to Museum Island, and the immediate area is certainly the place to be at night! There is an open market; there are bands and cafes; and there is the widest variety of people you can imagine! It is a safe, clean area, and the hotel is nestled on a little street away from all the craziness. The single room is small basic: bed, window, bathroom. The toiletries were surprisingly upscale: the same fragrant soap I had in a hotel in Provence. Across the stree from the hotel there is a great Italian eatery. You really cannot get a better bargain in Berlin for lodging, as long as you are willing to forego the extreme luxuries of the three-star hotels. Really -- when you're in Berlin, how much time will you spend in your room? There is too much to see and do in the city itself. The room is just for sleeping, and the Taunus provides a perfect place to rest your head!", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cSo-so...but the area is great !\u201d", "Author": "MereteJ", "ReviewID": "UR5895399", "Content": "As a frequent traveller to Berlin, I'd say the pros and cons of this hotel compared to hotels of equal prize are as following: Pros: The neighbourhood...the hotel is located in between Oranienburger Strasse and Hackesche H\u00f6fe which means you are equally close to great dining, shopping and transportation facilities...and only a 10 minute walk away from Alexander Platz. The elderly man who seemed to be the owner of the hotel and who recieved me on my arrival was also very nice and helpful. Cons: The room I rented was extremely small and had absolutely nothing in it but a very small bed, a small tv and a closet. The bathroom, while squeaky clean, was also fit for a midget only and lacked such facilities as a blow-dryer, shampoos etc. which are standard in most hotels of equal price in Berlin. The remote control for the TV did not work and the volume of the TV set could not be adjusted manually resulting in that the TV was on so loud I could not stand to watch it. The tram drove right underneath my window - as it must do under all the hotel's windows - creating a lot of noise. As for the lobby, the hallways, etc. the hotel is very small, dark and claustrophobic. All in all...I would say it is defintely possible to find better hotels in Berlin that are not more expensive. The Taunus is much closer to being a two-star hotel than being the three-star hotel it supposedly says it is.", "Date": "October 1, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Taunus", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234946-Reviews-Hotel_Taunus-Berlin.html", "Price": "$116 - $130*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "234946", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/6/6/4/2/22466/22466.jpg"}}
