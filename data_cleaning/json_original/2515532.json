My daughter had the restaurant breakfast one day and said it was also good. I was also able to print out boarding passes with a nice, upscale computer. Use the trolley - we went all over the place on it for $5 each per day. We went down to the Mexican border on it as well as taking bus #30 to LaJolla and Imperial Beach for the day. The cost of a cab to this hotel from the airport was $18 in rush hour - just be careful you are being dropped at the correct terminal on your way back because we made the mistake of saying Delta and yet we were on a commuter flight of Delta's, so we needed to walk quite a distance to get to the proper terminal.

The proximity to the trolley system and the free parking both contributed to our initial selection of this hotel. After staying there, I would have to say that the name is rather appropriate, as it was a good value. As noted in prior reviews, it is an older motor-lodge-type hotel, two stories high with parking immediately outside the rooms. The insides appear to be kept up well, especially considering their age. There was a little evidence of wear and tear (large chip missing from the side of the toilet tank lid and one rough patch on the sheets,) but everything was clean and functional. It should be noted that the walls and ceilings are quite thin, though we heard footfalls from above more than any other sort of noise. The windows have been replaced at some point, so I don't recall hearing much in the way of noise from outside. Quite a bit of light from the street behind the hotel made it in through the bathroom window, but was easily resolved by closing the bathroom door. The mattress was also quite firm, as noted by my wife. Regardless, we did get a good night's sleep following our return to the room. The staff was helpful and professional. Check-in was quick (and handled by the on-duty manager, it appears, as the desk clerk was helping another guest.) They also offered information on Old Town which is located right across the street. The staff was also very helpful in resolving a minor issue we had shortly before checking out. Finally, the location did work very well for accessing the trolley system. Though we returned around 9PM, the area still seemed reasonably safe as we walked the roughly 1/4 mile back from the transit center to the hotel. (Still, doesn't hurt to keep an eye open when walking around any big city at night...) Overall, we felt that the Padre Trail Inn was a good value for the rate they charged, considering that to actually stay downtown would cost four to five times more, and you would have to pay to park at your hotel. The bed's firmness might have been an issue for us had we stayed more than one night (though that could also just have been the room,) but we would gladly stay there again for another overnight visit to San Diego.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cdecent hotel but requires improvement(3.5 stars)\u201d", "Author": "wilddream w", "ReviewID": "UR122342583", "Content": "I stayed here for the Christmas weekend and the day I checked in at night on Christmas eve and the person was not very friendly but gave the two rooms together as desired.

I was in town visiting friends. Since the residences in SD are super tiny I just wanted my own place to shower and sleep. Check in was easy. The guy at the front desk was very nice. I pulled up to my room to find a truck full of guys sitting outside smoking and drinking, who were staying in the room next door to mine, I promptly went back to the front desk and asked for another room which was no problem, however it wasn\u2019t that far away from the first room. If I had been traveling with my boyfriend we wouldn\u2019t have made it 5 minutes in this place. My room was the second most run down hotel room I\u2019ve ever stayed at. As soon as I walked in and put my stuff down I was on the phone trying to meet up with my friends ASAP. I also stayed out as late as possible so I would be too tired to care what I was coming back too. The bed was fine but I\u2019m glad I brought extra pillows. The location is great as it\u2019s close to everything! I felt perfectly safe. I\u2019m not a person who cares about d\u00e9cor or other miniscule flaws; however, I do care about patches of black mold spores covering the bathroom ceiling, particularly when that ceiling is only about 6 feet tall. For some reason the ceiling in the shower is substantially shorter than the rest of the bathroom. My bf who is 6\u20194\u201d wouldn\u2019t have fit in there. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d and the water hit me at my belly button I had to get on my knees to wash my hair. I also would have to shut the water off mid shower to let the tub drain. Also, if you are staying by yourself don\u2019t close the bathroom door all the way when you take a shower because the door tends to swell shut and you might get stuck in there for a little while :-/ I was also bit by ants while using the restroom. On my first morning I was awoken at 6:30 am to what I thought was an earthquake. The building was cracking, having lived in SD for 3 years I know what it sounds like, however, it turned out just to be the people above me. You can hear every footstep, when the shower comes on, when the dresser doors open, when the front door closes, and when housekeeping is vacuuming. My bf has worked at a hotel front desk for years and when a hotel is half empty, like this one was, he never puts people on top of each other or right next to each other, why \u2013 because of all the complaints. I do not understand the logic behind cramming everyone next to each other for no apparent reason it\u2019s extremely inconsiderate. I\u2019m on vacation I don\u2019t want to have to wake up when my neighbors wake up. The second morning I woke up to the same scenario but then about 8 am my air conditioner started making a horrible noise. It sounded like someone was in the vent banging on it with a hammer. I shut it off for an hour and tried again but it was still making the noise, and then waited another hour but no such luck. So I called the front desk and asked if I could change rooms, preferably upstairs. This was no problem someone ran over and brought me a key to a room upstairs within minutes. They even offered to help me with my bags (FYI there is no elevator). When I got to the new room it was like I was at a totally different hotel. It was in far better shape than the one downstairs. The shower was clean and the tub drained quickly, but this could be due to the fact that the water coming out of the shower head in this room only came out like a slow drip. We\u2019re talking zero water pressure. Although I didn\u2019t have to worry about people pounding around on the ceiling, I had the most obnoxious neighbors on both sides of me. The one to the left kept their front door open with the TV blaring all evening. When the door was shut, they came in and out every 15 minutes to smoke. I could hear every word of every conversation on both sides of me. I didn\u2019t wake up to the sounds of the building cracking my third morning just the sounds of vacuum cleaners. When housekeeping is in your neighbors room it sounds like they are in your room. The air conditioner started making the same noise as before around 9 am. So in conclusion, if you end up staying here and have any problems the staff will work with you to solve them, but how many times do you want to do that? If they didn\u2019t cram their guests together when they had the space to scatter them, they would get at least 1 extra star probably even 2 because I wouldn\u2019t have had half the problems that I did. If you\u2019re hard of hearing and like to wake up at the crack of dawn then this is the place for you. If however you have the hearing of a dog and like to sleep in until there is at least double digits on the clock then I suggest you go elsewhere.

The bathroom towel rack was coming off the wall, the bathroom door was literally separating at the bottom, the toilet paper was a sping and half a spinner and the door had obviously been kicked in, as the jamb had been pieced back together, with putty placed around it.

Not only did online pictures and descriptions not give an accurate portrayal of this hotel, they were a gross sense of false advertising. The pool which is supposedly located in the palm tree filled courtyard is actually situated nicely between a large area of parking lot and the nearest highway. You may be a little late to the pool if you are busy sleeping in on the hard beds. I realize that this may be hard to do though, if you bed is shaking at 7 am in the morning because of the jackhammers at the large construction site next door, or if the hotel maintenance decides that trimming the bushes at 8 am is a good idea as well. Top this off with unresponsive staff who would not bring us toilet paper because they didn't want to leave the office at the hour of 11 pm and the on-site American style restaraunt that cost us just over $30.00 for 4 of us to have scrambled eggs and toast!
