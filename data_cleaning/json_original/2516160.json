I paid a little more for a river room and would recommend the expense - while the terraces are cramped, you can leave your door open, hear the birds and smell the eucalyptus. One small criticism of the Inn - while I was there the bar was understaffed, and the bartender had to do double-duty fetching food from the restaurant next door. Also, while I was there in the off-season, I would take care if I booked a room in the warmer months to NOT have a room over the patio which also faces the river.

We knew we wouldn't be spending too much time at the hotel since it was our first time to the Napa area, so we chose something that was affordable and had good reviews. Overall, we had a great experience. It rained the entire trip but the hotel staff had umbrellas at the bellhop stand that we could use when needed. The staff was friendly but they didn't go out of their way to be helpful. On entering the property for the first time, it was pouring outside and I was struggling to get our 3 bags in the door while my husband parked our car. The girl at the front desk either pretended not to see me or actually didn't see me struggle, but was friendly once I got the bags in and approached her. I had to ask for a bellhop to help me take the bags up to the room. Not that I couldn't do this myself, but it was odd to me that since I was the only guest in the lobby at the time, that no one offered their assistance. The same thing happened at check out - no one offered to assist us with our luggage. However, this is my ONLY complaint about the hotel and it really didn't affect our stay at all. We used the gym once, it was small but not crowded at all (one treadmill, 2 bikes, one elliptical and some free weights). The pool looked nice but with all the rain, we didn't get to use it. It looked like there were walking trails around the property too but we never checked it out. The room was clean, shower was HUGE, and it had great amenities. Due to reading some reviews on trip advisor, we thought that there was a buffet breakfast, but that must have changed recently because the only breakfast was next door in their restaurant, which was pretty good! I asked the girl at the front desk about upgrading to a \"breakfast\" package (I read to do this on trip advisor) but she said since we purchased through orbitz she couldn't add anything to our pre paid rate. We just paid full price for breakfast which wasn't expensive, and it got us to get out and try other breakfast spots which was nice (I highly recommend \"the general store\" in downtown Napa). The concierge helped us make dinner reservations one night, and she was very knowledgeable and helpful.

When staying at other hotels, one of my pet peeves is not having a large enough bathroom for the both of us as we're either trying to get ready to start the day sightseeing or getting dressed up for a night out on the town. The sinks & counters are never wide enough for me to shave and for her to do her makeup at the same time. At the River Terrace Inn, our River Side King room had a sitting area with a large lighted mirror and extendable magnifying mirror for my wife to do her makeup while I got to use the sink to shave. This may seem a minor perk, but we try to take advantage of every minute while on vacation so this added benefit certainly helped. Along with the large bathroom, came a small mini fridge where could store our soft drinks,assorted cheeses, and leftover meals from their awesome restaurant, Cuvee. We were pleased with the selections of wine available for purchase too. We popped open a bottle of Franciscan and were surprised to find they only charged a very small dollar amount on the bottle compared to what we noramlly pay for it at the store. Nice to see they don't gouge their guests like some hotels do for in-room amenities. We used the elegant robes provided free of charge, the internet free of charge, the coffeemaker, the iron, the stylish & easy to use alarm clock, huge lineup of HD cable channels, the walking trail behind the hotel that runs along the Napa River, the bar, the free coffee in the morning, the free USA today newspaper, and lastly the free access to the gym. Had it been warm enough to use the pool, well.... Our ground room floor had a small balcony with 2 chairs and a table with a fantastic view of the river. The rooms are well built with solid walls and ceilings buffering out any outside noises. The beds were comfortable ( I used the pull out queen sleeper sofa one night ) and the climate in the room was always perfect. Their signature restaurant, Cuvee serves amazing food with personalized service. It is a small establishment and getting a table will require some advanced planning on your part. They do take reservations so take advantage of it. I used my Open Table phone app to make reservations that morning for 7:00PM and was able to get in. When we arrived, there was a couple in front of us who had just walked in and were informed they were completely booked for the night. I originally had reservations at another boutique hotel around the corner (Best Western's Elm House Inn) but about a month before our trip I wanted to see if there were any better deals out there and came across the River Terrace Inn. After doing a comparison, I ended up saving over $147 for our 3 night stay.

Our other \"issue\" was with the breakfast...within their website, it does say that there is a free breakfast included in the price of the room (I just checked, it's still there). When we checked in, they gave us the hours of breakfast service and pointed out the room where the breakfast is served, just as if we were at a Hampton Inn or some other hotel where breakfast is included w/the price, no mention of a fee. I asked if it was included and was informed it was $12 pp. I had a copy of the text from the website stating that breakfast was included w/the price of the room...we received vouchers for the 3 days we were there. Evidently, they stopped including breakfast back in April, a few things have slipped through the cracks.

Over our four day stay we had to get three sets of keys because the keys stopped working, even though we kept them in an envelope and away from cell phones and credit cards. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but after a day out exploring vineyards and biking, that extra 15 minutes waiting to get a new key seems like forever. On our final night, that extra 15 minutes cost us our dinner reservations and a prolonged wait at Grace's Table. We had an incident with something missing from our room that staff were quick to respond to, but the follow-up by the general manager left us less than satisfied. His basic response was we were mistaken, we must have consumed the item and forgot. Definitely not the case. They eventually offered to replace the item, but after two days of back and forth I just thanked them and declined. Then upon check out we were charged for a can of beer from the mini bar. We never even opened the mini bar. When my husband brought it up with the front desk, they quickly took it off the bill, but they \"jokingly\" asked him, are you sure your wife didn't drink it and you don't know about it?

Just as some TA reviewers said, you can walk to the downtown area but it is not a short walk and not much to see on the road. We were given a two-for-one drink coupon at Cuvee when we checked in. The restaurant is right next to the hotel. We went there one night and ordered some happy hour appetizer and the food was quite good. Pro: 1. Quite location by a small river. 2. Nice bar and outdoor sitting area. Con: 1. The room is spacious but there is only one small desk you can put stuffs. 2. There was some cobweb on the room ceiling which was directly above the bed, and some small blackish bugs stuck on the ceiling above the desk. Since we didn\u2019t discover these until late in the evening, and we had to get up really early next morning for the tour, we didn\u2019t bother to call the staff. Those bugs were gone after we came back from our tour the next day but the cobweb was still there. 3. I think there might some training issues: some of the staffs we met were very helpful whereas some of them were not. 4. I think there are some problems with this hotel\u2019s own reservation system. I called the hotel to make the first reservation because my home internet was down at the time. After that, I made the second reservation through the hotel\u2019s website. Later on I called the hotel to cancel my first reservation because my sister couldn\u2019t join me. Then I received two cancellation confirmation emails from the hotel. I thought it was strange so I called the hotel and ask them to check. I was told that the one I made from website was still booked but it used a different confirmation number. When I arrived the hotel after 3pm, I told the front desk I had a reservation, a lady told me that the room was not ready. At the time, I thought it was strange because there were at least 6 other people went to check in after us, all of them got their room keys right away. When I checked out, I was given a bill statement with wrong room rate (expensive than the one I booked). The same front desk lady told me that all my two reservations were cancelled and she gave me a room with the regular rate. If it was the case, how come I could still see my reservation with booked status right before I left for Napa? Why she didn\u2019t tell me at the first place? I wasted precious time to wait for the room being cleaned up. I was not happy obviously. After I told her my side of story, she said she needed talk to the manager.

Another front desk person checked our reservation said nothing and brought us the general manager who finally came to us and let us know we did not have the specific type of room we had reserved. After ample opportunities, only now as we were upset, it occurred to them to acknowledge their mistake for the 1st time. We were very disturbed by the obvious tentative to fool us into getting an inferior room without mentioning it. Perhaps we would not notice the missing whirlpool and would have paid higher price for an inferior room. Then, the general manager informed there was no room as we requested, informed they were fully booked and offered we get the same inferior room we almost got fooled into taking for half the price.

They won't tell you this but they put a hold on some of the funds until several days after you've checked out to ensure payment on anything you might charge back to your room (movies, room service, mini bar, etc). It's a standard practice at hotels. The only problem is, if you're not expecting it and your funds are tight, the hold will make money in your own bank account unusable until the authorization is released (what they tell you: 3-5 business days later, reality: 7-14 business days later). We live paycheck to paycheck. We saved and pre-paid our entire reservation. We had no intention of charging anything to our room (not that the hotel would have known that). We have bills due but will now have to be paying them late because of the hold on the money in our own account. I work in a hotel myself. I've dealt with this issue many times. Where I work, we've gone to charging debit cards daily to keep from doing this very thing. I should have asked about it when I checked in. My mistake. But when I called, I was told there wasn't anything they could do. I know that's not true. They could call the bank to have it released sooner.

Again, there was no information in the room about the restaurants in the area - please change that.

Upon checking in, I was told since I was paying with a debit card that a total amount of approx $678.00 would be held this includes $50.00 a day for incidentals. I informed Ben and the manager at the counter that this was impossible and I could not afford any funds being held and would not have $50.00 a day for incidentals I did not intend to use. I told them that it was a girls weekend with my best friend and neither one of us could afford funds held in our accounts. She had not arrived since she was stuck in traffic. I informed the staff neither one of us held credit cards and was not aware of this policy regarding debit cards. Then the manager asked if I could pay my portion today and if my friend could also pay when she arrived. I said yes, that would be no problem. I was told nothing would be held in the accounts. Today my friend found that $310.00 is being held in her account which is causing numerous problems. Apparently she contacted someone in billing who told her a different story and that the holding of funds cannot be worked around. Just blew her off. How can that be? As far as I can see no funds were held on my account, staying true to what the manager told me. Why people who do not have credit cards get penalized is beyond me. Then we were told by your staff that Andretti Winery was the winery of the month and \"he\" would be pouring wines between 5:30 and 6:30...I asked if they meant Mario Andretti and was told yes, and then when I asked another staff member before leaving for dinner, was told yes again...my friend and I went out for dinner but made sure we were back so we could meet Mr.Andretti only to find it was someone from his winery...Mr. Andretti is currently in Iraq...another mistake by your staff. We were unable to use the balcony at night due to the heavy moisture and dew in the air, the balcony was wet and huge drops would continuously fall like rain and we could not enjoy the balcony at night Poor reception on some of the tv channels. On top of everything else, we had constant noise in the late evening and early mornings we assume by a guest and then housekeeping staff.. someone was constantly pacing the floors and moving heavy objects, slamming doors and we could hear the vacuum cleaner going...totally ridiculous!

Flew international and was a few days early for a conference in Vegas so decided to visit Napa. Rented a car at SFO and drove down. The traffic getting towards Napa on the interstate is bad. Got to the hotel around 630 PM. The hotel is just off Soscol Ave opposite side of Napa Mills. I had booked the room almost 2 months ago but when I checked in I was told that they could not find my reservation!!! Fortunately I had a print out of the reservation and so they created a new reservation for me. I would dread to think what would have happened had this happened in peak season. This time of the year occupancy is very low so they could get me the room. I had a rate of $143 per night. We were booked into a King size with a balcony. A tip for my fellow travelers. If you are going in winter dont bother with the balcony. Its freezing cold and so there is little chance you will ever get to enjoy the balcony. It was cold; at least for out standards; we live in India. Temperature's were hovering between 1 and 8 celsius. The hotel is located about 1/2-3/4 mile from Napa mills area where all the restaurants and bars are present. You cant walk there in winter as its too cold and the hotel did not seem to have any transportation to that area. They have free breakfast which was decent. The food at the restaurant while limited is pretty decent. They have free parking and free wifi. Next morning we went to 2 wineries. I was a bit surprised that the hotel staff did not bother recommending any wineries or give us any coupons. They did give us when we asked for it; but considering this place is so highly rated on TA I would have assumed a more proactive approach from their side. We asked and got 2 coupons from them; one had free tasting and another one had free cheese plate. Here is another tip. The winery will try to cheap out if you are going to use coupons; will give lower quality wine or only 1 kind of cheese. So overall the quality of stay was not bad but I would categorize this hotel as a 3.5 star. There was nothing exceptional about the hotel so I really did not understand why the hotel is so highly rated on TA. I would think that only an exceptional stay should get 5 stars.

I observe that complaints mainly stem from unmet, unrealistic expectations or travelers inability to ask for what they want when they are at a property. Some of the poor reviews that I read here in advance had me worried enough that I sent a query to the general manager. Thank goodness that he reassured me and my husband and we went through with our plans for a 3-night stay. Here\u2019s the scoop; the River Terrace Inn is not a quaint little B&B or a name-brand luxury hotel. Perhaps the Inn does itself a bit of a disservice by describing itself as \u201cluxury boutique,\u201d as it\u2019s more like a Holiday Inn with a few more personal touches. (The elevators and hallways have that sort of feel.) That being said, River Terrace Inn is a super-comfortable medium-sized hotel with a convenient edge-of-town location, ideal as a Napa/Sonoma touring base. We chose their premium room, a Riverview Deluxe Balcony Jacuzzi, a great value for the region with their 3rd-night free special. We indeed had a nice river view and enjoyed the sound of birds in the morning and crickets at night. (I think that I would have found the atmosphere a little too industrial with a \u201cvillage\u201d side room, but the third floor river view was just pastoral enough, yet within an easy walk of downtown.) The room itself was spacious with places to keep everything from our luggage to picnic supplies and wine purchases. The bed was comfy, but add my husband to the list of guests who found the bed sheet and mattress pad undone by morning. Everything worked well, from Internet service to the Jacuzzi for two, (plenty of hot water) to the in-room fridge and coffeemaker. We had \u201cgood neighbors\u201d during our stay, but were aware that noise between rooms was a potential problem. Breakfast was not anything the Culinary Institute of America would endorse, but there were adequate choices to get the day going and it was pleasant to eat on the riverside outdoor patio with the gas fireplace and heaters taking off the morning chill. Parking was ample and convenient and, like breakfast and internet service, included in the room rate. We never saw a concierge at the lobby desk, but had we desired help, there was always at least one staff person in view to ask. We were offered luggage assistance and (free) valet parking when we arrived and I am sure that we could have asked for help upon departure too. My intent in writing this review is not to damn the Inn with faint praise, but to be honest, so as not to raise expectations and create disappointment for future guests. We were looking for a comfortable and quiet, but not fussy base for our wine country getaway and that is what we found at the River Terrace Inn. We would be happy to return", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Brunswick, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Canadian_Hoser", "ReviewID": "UR79680503", "Content": "We loved everything about this hotel.

We were gald we did as they were amazing too! Celadon had the best food we have ever had and we have traveled all over the carribean/hawaii/USA/Canada. Amazing food there but also amazing at the hotels restaurant. Try both! We had a mid week special (Mon-Thurs) where you stay 2 nights and get the third night free.

There was not another room available and we decided not to stay at the hotel. The staff was very good about it and canceled our reservation with no charges. We then went to another hotel in downtown Napa and for about the same price got a room that was larger in a newer hotel with amenities (like central air conditioning) and furnishings that literally blew the doors off of the River Terrace Inn.

The bathroom was large and actually quite luxurious with a huge glass-enclosed, tiled walk-in shower with double shower head, a large vanity with lots of storage, Bath and Body Works toiletries, and a separate toilet area. The bed was quite comfy, but the pillows were down-filled, which you may love, but we didn't because they were a little too squishy and tended to get flat as you sleep. Decor was very nice. Housekeeping kept the room spotless, and even came by in the late afternoon each day to check if we needed anything. I had seen some reviews that complained about thin walls, and I could see how this could be true. We were on the corner of the building on 3rd floor, so for us we dodn't have much of a problem, but we did notice that we could hear some noises from the room on one side of us a few times. I do give River Terrace props for being aware of this though, because there was a very nice white noise machine on the bedside table that you could set to practically any sound you wanted to down out noise while you sleep. We use one at home, so we loved this touch. High-speed internet access was also included in our room rate. FOOD/BAR: Didn't use the bar there, but we did get coupons for a comp glass of wine at Cuvee, the hotel's restaurant (on the property, but not attached to the hotel).

Not anything super impressive, but an average medly of pastries and breads, eggs, sausage, cereals, fruit, etc. A large outdoor terrace that you can sit and eat. GENERAL: Friendly front desk staff. We didn't use valet much because the parking lot is pretty much right outside the hotel doors, but when we did they were quick and helpful. Good location near downtown Napa, it was easy to get to. Also, it has a pool and small fitness center which both looked nice but we didn't use. The back of the property was very pretty, with the Napa River running right behind it and a nice walking path running alongside that begs for a leisurely stroll.

In the past I used to stay at Villagio and Vintage Inn, both top rated hotels, but as their rates kept going up and my paycheck kept getting slashed I needed something that was less expensive - but I didn't want to give up the comforts of a 4 star hotel. I was glad to find River Terrace Inn. The downtown location makes it close to the restaurants (Bounty Hunter for Monday specials, Hog Island Oysters for happy hour, Celedon for a romantic night out, Cuvee for $5 happy hour appetizers) and it's located right on the river. Inside the hotel it's nice and upscale, and the rooms feature trendy decorations, great linens, and a flat screen TV. Terrific free breakfast, and an outdoor patio that's perfect for starting your day. The only things missing are a fireplace in the room and a giant romantic bathroom (though the bathroom is nice, it's not spa-like as you would find at Vintage Inn). I also liked the staff a lot. They went out of their way to help the visitors and business people staying there. And the rates! Yes, the rates are downright affordable.

We arrived early but were still allocated a room and allowed to check in with no problems.

I made the most of the bath too as the bathroom was significantly nicer than the standard motel. The River Terrace Inn offers a luxurious atmosphere with a nice lounge area where we spent the evenings drinking wine and sampling their cheese platter (highly recommended). The breakfast included is spot on with a wide range of hot cooked food, cereal, continental breakfast and fresh fruit. The hotel also offers complimentary dvd service which is a nice touch and allows you to make the most of the large flat screen tvs in the bedrooms.

Property is well located in Napa, and our room had a nice view of the river. Overall, property seemed well maintained and furnishings were in good condition.

The pictures of the property on the web site were representative of what we experienced. Breakfast was better than I expected with a selection from eggs and potatoes to fresh fruit and their homemade granola. The only thing I would fault is guest service. I contacted the concierge before arriving to see if they could be helpful in planning my trip, and found them to be the least helpful I have encountered just about anywhere. In discussing a potential dinning reservation, the woman asked if I had tried Open Table, and when I said I had, she suggested I just keep calling the restaurant myself to see if there were any cancellations. As it turned out, I did later call and got a reservation for the day and time I wanted on the first try. What a hero she could have been, if she only had not been too lazy to pick up the phone herself! She was also of so little help in discussing wineries that I gave up trying. The only thing I can think of in her defense was that I learned that I called about twenty minutes before she left for the day on a Friday. I also never saw anyone at the concierge desk in the lobby during our entire stay. Also, of interest was that the hotel had free valet parking on Sunday afternoon when we arrived, but not when we returned Sunday night or any of the rest of our stay thereafter.

We're not even wine aficionados, but it was a part of the state we thought we should visit. For 4 days, we were not disappointed. Of course it helps to have a love for seeing new places, good food, beautiful scenery and interesting sights and for that, Napa filled the bill. So we were hoping to find accommodations that matched the appeal of Napa without breaking the bank. With the recommendation of a friend, the River Terrace Inn served as our base. The location was right outside of the central business district of the town of Napa and located on the Napa River, a smallish river with a lazy Mississippi flow. There is no access to the river, but it seems a romantic place, more so than in reality. It's too bad as it's river location is something that should be better taken advantage of by the hotel, if indeed it is allowable by those who have jurisdiction over the river bank. Also close by, within walking distance is the Oxbow Market and COPIA, both excellent attractions for food and wine. On site is an outdoor pool which loses sunlight a couple of hours before sundown, a small exercise facility with 3 or 4 machines and few free weights, a large lobby lounge area and outdoor patio where the complimentary breakfast is served and consumed. There may be some meeting rooms, but otherwise, it's a 4 storey wood frame building that's fairly attractive. Our room, unfortunately was on the Ground Floor adjacent to the Exercise Room and turned out to be one of the 'accessible rooms' for disabled guests. The room itself was comfortable for the 4 of us parents and college age kids and was fairly well appointed. Strangely, the two lamp bedlamp between the two Queen beds would not allow to only switch one lamp or the other, both were either on or off. A little annoying. While on lighting, the bathroom was very dimly lit. We also had to ask for an arm chair which due to the disabled access requirements was not provided on arrival. There is no wireless internet signal, but the hardwire is complimentary. There is a large flat screen TV. Our room being next to the Exercise Room, was not completely sound proofed, being able to hear the muffled pounding on the treadmill. Newspaper provided to the room is USA Today and the Napa Valley Register is available at the Lobby. There is I believe an on-site restaurant, Terrace Cafe, however we did not give it a chance with so many other culinary options available in the area. However the complimentary breakfast is, in my mind, the best thing going here. There is plenty of selection including hot and cold items, good variety of fruit and baked goods and all well prepared, but not made to order. There is complimentary wine tasting too I believe, but again we were out for this activity enjoying the Napa sights and smells. If you have to work off some of the calories from dining in the Valley, there is a 1.2 mile pedestrian path that follows the same river shoreline that starts about 4 blocks north of the hotel on Lincoln Ave which makes for a nice flat jog. All in all, the River Terrace Inn was a nice stay, however not one to really \"write home about\". Staff were nice and generally helpful, although they do not have a concierge. The breakfast made it for us. In this price range, there is not much in the immediate area. However a Westin is just being completed immediately next door, also on the river's edge, which I'm sure will give cause to the RTI to step it up a notch.

We took advantage of a third-night-free promotion and saved many hundreds of dollars that went, instead, toward dinners at nationally prominent restaurants Ubuntu (vegetarian) and Angele as well as a local crowd pleaser called Tuscany--all highly recommended, and all within a short walk of the hotel. Our room was on the third floor, where the ceilings are a bit higher, and faced the river, which we recommend, as the only other option is the a parking-lot view in the front. Room size and amenities were impressive for the price. The pool and excercise room aren't much to speak of, but the morning breakfast buffet (complimentary) was varied and high quality despite the expectable \"excuse me\" and \"pardon me\" issued every few seconds as you bumped into the teenagers (and their parents) jostling for the best muffin and cheese-covered scrambled eggs. But the dining terrace with water-view (check out the resident geese) makes it all worthwhile, not to mention the generous selection of DVD's to rent (gratis), the marble bath with jacuzzi, and the overall fit and finish, spotless with turn-down service to boot.

As I was lined up waiting to be served, I could hear the same girl (Niki) calling other rooms that had not checked out at 11am. It was clear from her conversations with these guests that a late check out was also granted to several other hotel guests. And, like me, they were rudely told that if they were not out of their rooms soon, an additional night's stay would be charged. I could not believe my ears. When I finally got to the desk, i informed Niki that she should understand we were approved the late check out. Rather than apologize for the inconvenience, she brushes off my comments by saying Pete had no authority to okay late check outs. As a frequent international business traveller, I have had my fair share of hotel issues. I can honestly say that Niki is hands down the rudest hotel staff I have encountered in memory. I was willing to forego the misunderstanding on the check out times as well as the clear problems they have internally on who is authorized to do what, but I could not ignore the rudeness. Rather than effectively turn an unfortunate situation to a positive by simply apologizing for the error, she denounces a fellow colleague and angers a guest.

This represents my main complaint about this place -- no one cares about you and your problems! First, the occasion was my husband's 60th birthday. I planned to take him on the wine train and to sample some of the great restaurants in the valley. We had sailed our boat up the Napa River a long time ago, and enjoyed the whole experience. I was entranced by the River Terrace Inn website, and reserved the very best room, \"with a balcony and view of the river\". What we got was a ground floor room with a view of a pile of gravel. I went to the front desk to complain that this is not what I had asked for. They looked at me blankly and said that was all that was available. There was no apology or expression of concern. While I was there I inquired of the activity desk about Copia, and the woman was unfriendly and uninformative, had nothing about Copia, and didn't offer to find any. Next, my husband's cell phone disappeared during the pleasant breakfast they provide on the terrace (on very tiny plates), and when we reported it there was again a total lack of concern. Given the type of clientele at the hotel (well heeled) it is likely a staff person found it or took it. And when we called its number, it was busy! It was not lost, for sure. It is too bad the staff has had no customer service training -- it would make it a much nicer place. The room was large, and it had a tiny screened in balcony, hardly wide enough to sit down in, but who wanted to look at the pile of gravel? And the walls are paper thin. It was possible to hear every sound in the next room. The bathroom is pleasant, but on the first morning, my husband had to clean ants out of the shower. Please note that the hotel is not at all that close to the downtown area -- you really have to like walking to make that a true statement. It is also close to a lot of construction (there is a plan in place to completely renovate the riverfront). I would come back to this place if they would give me the room I asked for, if they would train their staff to be a little more pleasant and concerned for the comfort of their guests.

When we checked in we were given a very nice room but it did not have a bath only a shower. It was a nice shower area but after a five hour drive I like to bathe my aching limbs so we went back to the front desk and asked for a room with a bath. The very young staff on duty dithered and said none were available unless we paid extra which we were not prepared to do. They told us to call back but each time they kept saying come back again.The most annoying thing was one young lady kept saying 'Checking out' each time we went back - she totally forgot who we were each time even though once it had only been 30 minutes since we had enquired. The following day an older member of staff was on duty and she told us the hotel always give 'Expedia' bookings the rooms with no baths. We complained that was not detailed in the booking so she then immediately found us another room at no extra cost. So it became clear that the inexperienced young staff the previous day were aware of that but did not have the authority to change our room or did not have the flair to take the time to address the problem and take responsibility themselves. The rooms are very nice and the beds are extremely comfortable. However, there are signs warning you not to touch various goodies like the mini-bar etc are you will be charged - it was abit like a mine field! The balconies are like window boxes and overlook the car park. There is a new hotel being built next door and the building site overlooks the very small pool which is shaded for most of the day. A long floating pump was a nuisance too so you could not swim easily. The breakfast was good even though they kept running out of things quickly and there were no trays to ferry your goodies outside. There were also no large spoons to eat cereal only teaspoons. The terrace is next to the river but you can hardly see it and it is only sunny at breakfast time not in the evening which was a shame. The young porters were very helpful drawing maps etc to get into town which is quite a long way away from the hotel if you don't want to drink and drive. We took a Platypus tour of the wine valley and we would thoroughly recommend it. The lady driver was excellent and the other ten people on the bus were great fun. It was the best day of the trip and we didn't have to worry about driving all day. Lunch was thrown in too. Our opinion was that the hotel catered alot for corporate functions (there were plenty of people staying at the hotel who were on courses etc) but for the people who pay with their own hard earned cash the hotel was quite expensive for the service provided.

Following are my random thoughts on my stay here... I took my mother and sister to this hotel for a 2 night stay and we loved it. You can see from the many traveler photos that it is quite nice. It is not as inexpensive as some other hotels around which we found online for about $70/night, but since they were very basic and far from where we wanted to be and looked questionable as to their quality (leaving us wondering what we might find under the bed or sofa cushions and things like that), we ended up choosing the Napa Valley River Terrace Inn. It has a great location and a very very nice atmosphere for a tight \"Napa Budget\" (hotels are more expensive in Napa than in San Francisco where there are lots of business travelers and competition). Our room with two very comfortable and clean beds during high season was $129/night (including a free FULL continental breakfast) and we had 3 people in our room (the third was at no extra cost). We booked directly through the site as it offered the best value AND it allowed us to cancel up to 24 hours before our arrival (in case there was a problem or schedule change) with no cancel fee (some other sites on the net would not let us cancel for a full refund if we had booked this hotel through their site). The outside parking area and approach was quite nice with palm trees lining the driveway, and the lobby was quite beautiful too... the large leather chairs and the the large lodge-like fireplace were great!! It added some nice atmosphere to the lobby. The river and the tall trees in the back added a very quiet mood to the hotel and there was a nice jogging path and rather large park next to the hotel corner in the back. Some people prefer to pay more to have rooms that face the back and its view, but we had a room on a higher floor and on the end (our request in order to get the most privacy) with a view of the parking lot... normally this would NOT be so great at some other hotel, but their parking lot was quite clean, and beautifully landscaped... and the backside had lots of people in the morning walking around and eating breakfast anyway, so we felt the parking lot facing rooms were by far the best value... besides, they were cooler in the mornings as the sun faces the back side of the hotel making the front side in the shade and comfortable to sit on the balcony and watch the world... the backside I would imagine is too bright and maybe warm in the mornings and with the all the people below and noisy geese, I would choose the parking lot view without any hesitation. Besides, if you really want to sit and watch the river, then go downstairs and use some of the benches provided on the very edge of the river just behind the hotel... you will get the same effect and save yourself some money. The only problems were totally minor... 1)a free dvd we borrowed from the front desk's wide English and Spanish dvd selection was scratched which meant it kept skipping during play... a bit annoying, but since it was a free rental, what could I say.... besides, we just went downstairs and got another dvd and it was fine... and 2) the hotel staff was a little bit too casual I felt in how they stood around behind the front desk... HOWEVER, they were very friendly and kind and helpful about things to do in the area, but it just seemed that if they had been a bit more professional then this hotel could up its star rating... afterall, professionalism costs nothing, but it is what separates a good hotel from a GREAT hotel. It makes a strong positive statement which makes customers feel they participated in a quality experience and ABSOLUTELY want to return (a bit picky, I know, but if these two problems are the only negative points I could find with this hotel, then you should NOT hesitate to stay here... you will be quite pleasantly impressed I think). The breakfast was all totally continental, but it was so great and not cheap by any means. It definately would fill you up and the selection was wide... oh, and the juice was so good... I think it was 100% juice, NOT concentrate. The bathroom was nicely done with stone tile in the shower area, NOT a plastic surround!! It felt rather luxurious... Overall, this place is NOT a 5-star hotel. In reality, it is a 3 star hotel that has a 4.5 star quality feel. It really feels like it is trying its best to be something memorable, and so I would give it a definate high-grade hotel rating, and for the money we spent on our room which included a very satisfying breakfast, we felt we got a very very good deal, esp for the location and beautiful surroundings.

This was my third stay at this property, the previous two being for three nights each in October of 2005 and 2006. The hotel is located in the city of Napa so if you're expecting a quaint little inn located in the middle of a vineyard or dead end country road this might not be the best place for you. That being said the property is located far enough off of the street where traffic noise isn't an issue. This time we had a third floor room facing the front of the hotel. No problems with noise and you get a great view of the mountains in the distance. Even better, if you sit out back on the heated patio to enjoy a glass of wine, or if you have a room on the backside of the inn you're rewarded with a nice quiet river setting. The location of the River Terrace is perfect for exploring Napa, either by car or by foot. A few restaurants of note are within walking distance. Cuvee, which is good right across the parking lot and Celadon which is outstanding maybe a mile or so away. Also the Copia Center for Wine, Food and Arts is just around the corner. If you enjoy wine tasting I suggest booking the 3:00pm barrel tasting at Del Dotto Vineyards. The tasting takes about 60-90 minutes and is both informative and VERY generous. By the time you have finished the tour I imagine you would have consumed about a bottle of wine on your own. The good thing is you're only about 4 miles away from the hotel at this point so it's easy to get back and rest up before dinner. As has been mentioned by others the River Terrace is a beautiful hotel so I won't repeat most points. The beds here are some of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Noise has never been a problem for me but then again I usually use the nature sound machine that's provided in the room to help me sleep. The gym is small but sufficient. A treadmill, elliptical, and two bikes. The only weights provided are dumbbells which range from 2.5 to 60 lbs. Wireless internet access is available free of charge in all rooms.

I should note that the pictures on the hotel's website give an accurate impression of what your room will like. Too many hotels show pictures of rooms that look much nicer than what you end up with. I thought the wines available from the mini-bar area provided a nice, well-balanced selection and were reasonably priced. A half bottle of a nice pinot noir was about $20 and bottles of good reds and whites were anywhere from the mid-20s to the upper 40\u2019s.

The pool is probably kept a little too warm for exercise, but if you think of it as a large hot tub, it\u2019s very nice.

Our room was large, decorated with harvest colors of amber and dusty green. The bath was large and pleasant. The king bed a was very comfortable pillow top. The little frig was nice. We borrowed a free DVD from the front desk and enjoyed a movie. The only negative was that the air conditioning was a little noisy. We had a corner room #229 with a view of the small river on one side and on the other side a view of their tiny swimming pool and an unattractive vacant lot with abandoned washer and dryer in the middle. Specify a \"river view that does not overlook the pool\" otherwise you'll get this view or a parking lot view. I was pleasantly surprised by the breakfast which was included in the room rate. The selection was ample, scrambled eggs, delicious fried potatoes, various fruits, granola, yogurts, nuts, cheeses, tomatoes & mozzarella, bakery items, and juices. (At home I only have cereal and milk for breakfast, so this was a breakfast extravaganza for me.) We ate on the patio overlooking the river. After, we took a short walk along the river, watching fishermen, kayakers, and birds come and go. It was surprisingly quiet and relaxing along this little river.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cMajor disappointment\u201d", "Author": "ORFemaleBizTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR5716863", "Content": "I made our reservation on River Terrace's site directly (this worked fine) for a special Junior Suite overlooking the river. This is not an inexpensive property for the area (our room $310 a night during high season in wine country). Check in was fine, the room (on the third floor and toward the end) was a quiet room and the small deck overlooking the river (two chairs, small table, room enough only to turn around) was pleasant enough, although overlooks the parking lot at one end of the view. You can open the window, which is pleasant. Blackout curtains were excellent. What we found objectionable about this hotel was primarily service. Check in was reasonably efficient and was friendly (the highlight of service in our 2-days experience was the clerk carrying in our luggage, who continually offered excellent suggestions and was extremely positive.) Coming and going through the lobby, we rarely were acknowledged from the front desk. The hotel doesn't have a separate elevator for the cleaning staff to use so in the mornings the elevators are full of ice trolleys, towel carts and an army of cleaning staff, etc. And no staff member that we ran into thought it was important to let guests come and go first rather than their carts, so we often waited on elevators as they were full of workers and equipment. In our room, the DVD player (which was discussed with much enthusiasm about the free DVDs available for view) did not work well and we finally gave up trying to watch a movie half-way through. The bathroom is spacious and nicely appointed, there is a separate dressing area for women to apply makeup, which is well lit and has a wall magnifying mirror (although if you are a man using one to shave it doesn't work as it's not over a sink.) There are bottles of wine set out on a counter above the mini bar. We were warned not to lift up the bottles, or a room charge would be made after 45 seconds. Our jacuzzi tub in the bathroom was large and deep but 3 out of 6 of the jets did not work at all. There is wireless computer service in the room. Ours did not work and we were told our room was too far away from the hub, so a cord was issued (which we could only have with a $200 deposit being made on our hotel bill and they would credit it back to us when we returned the cord.) The shower curtain came off it's hooks when you pulled it across the tub, because the curtain and liner are too heavy for the flimsy slider/holders. Towels -- luxe and lovely. My husband and I were going to have a masssage at the \"spa\", but we learned there is actually no physical spa. You simply decide you want a massage and the service provider is sent to your room. This wasn't what we were looking for, so we didn't purchase this service (which we generally do in other hotels with spas.) Generally, this hotel has more of a \"Sleepy Bear\" feel to it than a beautiful wine country inn. Check out time is 11 am, which is too early in comparison to most hotels of this \"substance\" and price in the area. We asked for a 30 minute late check out and were told \"absolutely not\" in no uncertain terms. We felt overlooked, underserviced and that this property wasn't interested in a return visitor.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cMajor diappointment\u201d", "Author": "sdbrick", "ReviewID": "UR5624720", "Content": "This hotel got a lot of positive comments so we decided to book it when we had to go to Napa for a wedding in July.

It was incredibly hot (between 100 and 116 degrees F, depending on which end of the valley) the week we stayed, so we didn't use the pool (the water was 90+ degrees F). However, I used the fitness center every morning and enjoyed a cigar on the terrace facing the river every evening. Peg, the one-footed goose, was on hand and enjoyed the bread offerings! The hotel is a short drive to either Route 29 or Silverado Trail (and I would recommend using the Silverado Trail over Route 29 to all - St. Helena is a huge bottleneck!) and our farthest winery visit (Schramsberg) was still only :30 away. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our friends, who stayed in Yountville a couple months prior, found the rate hard to believe as they had paid more than double.

The rooms were fine, peaceful, quiet. The pool was ok for my three-year-old, who didn't need anything fancy. The caveat I need to mention is that we thought we'd kick off our wine tasting with a visit to the wine bar that they say also has tapas. When we walked in, no one was there. We asked the front desk where the staff were - we were advised someone would be on their way. About 5 or 10 minutes later, someone showed and reluctantly served us some rather unexciting wine. We felt like we were putting this guy out for doing his job. No tapas anywhere in sight.

After reading the reviews here, I was more than a little concerned that I'd made a poor hotel choice, but as it turned out, we were very pleased with our stay and would not hesitate to recommend it to family and friends. The Inn is located in downtown Napa (sort of), within walking distance of the Napa Wine Train (but not much else). It's an easy 5-10 minute drive to get to Route 29, the main drag through the Valley from Napa to Calistoga. Our check-in was smooth, friendly and efficient, from the bell staff to the front desk. In a matter of minutes, we were in our River Junior Suite, with a balcony and nice view of the Napa River. We spent many a late afternoon/evening sitting on the balcony and enjoying a glass of wine or cold beer. If possible, spring for the river front suites -- the alternative is to get a room with a view of the parking lot, and while the river view is hardly extraordinary, it certainly beats the alternative. The rooms are very nicely appointed. The beds are as comfortable as you're likely to find in a hotel and the bathroom is very nice (ours was equipped with a jacuzzi tub, which was a little small, but nice). I particularly got a kick out of the dual-headed shower. It was great! Housekeeping was flawless and did a great job in our opinion -- our room was always cleaned and ready for us when we returned in the afternoon before dinner. The morning breakfast buffet was perfect for us and the price was unbeatable (free). If you've had the buffet at a Comfort Suites or Residence Inn, it's comparable -- nothing special, but just fine to start the day. Fresh fruit, danish, bagels, toast, cereal, scrambled eggs and potatoes, etc. Much as been written about apathetic or poor service, but we certainly didn't experience that -- in fact, we found the opposite. During the early part of our stay, the mornings were quite chilly sitting outside for breakfast, and my wife, who doesn't drink coffee, asked a staffer if they had hot chocolate. He said \"No, not normally, but he'd make her some using the espresso machine.\" And he did, and it was pretty darn good. When he saw her the next morning, he asked her if she'd like another. I guess a thank you and a smile goes a long way sometimes. I don't think it's been mentioned elsewhere, but the pool, which is fairly small (and can get crowded in the afternoon) is heated, which was great given the very cool mornings and evenings in Napa. There are too many terrific places to eat to mention them all, but some of our favorites included the Rutherford Grill, Wappa Taco in Calistoga (don't be fooled by the name of this little hole-in-the-wall spot -- we had a great lunch (tapas/Cuban sandwich) there), Taylor's Refresher in St. Helena (think 50's drive-in -- great burgers and shakes), and a picnic lunch at V.

We went there to relax, and we certainly did. We left the balcony room door open when we were in the room because the air was so fresh and we loved to hear the birds chirping. The pillow-top bed was so comfy. We took advantage of the library of DVDs you could borrow free of charge. We used the jacuzzi tub two out of the three nights, it filled up quickly, hot water was aplenty, and the jets were powerful enough but not overpowering. We ordered massages from the \"spa\", the only option was for the masseuses to come to our room which was fine by us.

No one called me back, no one came to the room, no one tried to do anything to resolve the problem. It was as if they were just waiting for us to check out. I thought that the hotel might be discriminatory toward us but then I heard another guest complain about something else and the front desk was just as uncaring and unwilling to try to resolve their problem.

Nothing spectacular but provides a comfortable stay for sightseeing. That's probably the way it should be. It's in downtown Napa so a bit of a drive to the vineyards compared to the others situated in the middle of the valley, but the location is convenient too, next to restaurants and a Walmart (in case you need basic ammenities). Our kids enjoyed watching the free DVD on the player in each room. The room is a bit cramped. Or the beds are too large for the room. There were 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 6 and 2) and it felt smaller than the other hotels we were stayed in. You cannot use the in-room minibar for storing personal food and drink, so ask for a complimentary fridge immediately upon check-in. Broadband access is free. Payed USd 139+ a night. There are countless other hotels more expensive and cheaper, but we were happy with our choice, this provided good value...It would be lower by USD 10-20 per night during weekdays and other times of the year. We were right in front of the access to the pool, so that was good and bad. But no one really swims at night so it was quite. Unfortunately one afternoon (around 4-5 pm) we were swimming and our kids were enjoying themselves. A guest apparently complained about the noise because they were sleeping at this time of day (hangover?). So if you are sensitive ask to be placed away from the pool. Otherwise the pool side seems to provide a better ambience. We didn't get a chance to have a meal, except for the free breakfast (generally cereal and muffins). Once I asked about lunch at 1130 am, and this busy waitress was quite abrupt in answering lunch will only be ready at 1230pm.

I went on a Thursday afternoon, so it didn't have the weekend crowds. Check-in was fast an easy. We had the 2 queen beds ($129 through their website). It had a balcony, which unfortunately overlooked the parking lot (at least I would know if someone was trying to steal my car!). I would've enjoyed the more intimate and secluded view of the river better, but those rooms were the suites. The bed linens are high-count Egyptian cotton (describes it on their website), but they were soooo soft and comfy. I'm going to buy some for my own bed! We had 2 queen beds w/ very comfy pillows. The decor of the room was fabolous and you can control the temperature in the room (heat & AC). There was also a ceiling fan, mp3/cd alarm clock, dvd player (lots of new dvd movies at the front desk to choose from, and they were free (if you return them)). There was a big shower, with no bathtub, but the shower and bathroom was immaculately clean and nicely decorated. Breakfast buffet in the morning consisted of eggs, sausage patties, bread & toast, muffins, etc. We got to eat on the patio next to the river. It was the first nice day in a while, so it was nice to sit in the sun and have breakfast. The night before, we hanged out at the patio, and stared at the stars. The only cons is that the $30 deposit fee for the dvd was on our bill in the morning, which they removed when they checked their dvd binder (what if someone else checked it out after us?) and you have to be careful not to move the items from the bar. I guess it's sensored, so they would know, and they would charge you. We didn't move it, but if you didn't read... Overall, it was a wonderful stay.

The bartender in the hotel bar was great and had excellent tips for dinner and knew a lot about the area. The in-room spa treatments were heavenly and convenient. They can give treatments to two people at a time per room. If you have three people in one room like me, the third person had to go to another room for their treatment - which was okay.
