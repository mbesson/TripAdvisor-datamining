{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Total disappointment This is by far one of the strangiest properties I've ever stayed at. It's so weird that I am having troubles comparing it to anything else. It looks like the original idea was great but the execution failed miserably. Here is the story:The property is very small (8 villas and a few rooms in the main building). It's located next door to Conrad, yet local taxi driver had no idea where it was. The grounds are kept well. Many villas are separated from the common areas by concrete wall (just like you see in movies about old-time Mexico) and look somewhat fancy from the outside. But once you enter the picture rapidly changes.It felt like originally the place was designed to be a fancy boutique hotel, but in the middle of the construction process the owner ran out of money. For instance, the bathroom has a shower and a bath, but all fixtures used are made of cheap and ugly-looking bluish ceramic. Besides, the ventilation hole has some wooden cover on it (like in some of the cheapest local motels), the phone has some torn wires and the wall is constantly wet.The same applies to the room. While the design is quite nice, the little details ruin it. Once you turn the AC on it brings some strange smell (later I figured where it came from), which makes you want to turn it off. The bed has a mosquito net. I've stayed in the hotel next door and it never needed the net. So I was wondering why these guys put it on.The hotel is indeed located on the beach (although none of the villas have a sea view) but the beach is a joke. It's only 20-30 meters wide and has ugly vendor stalls on each side. Right next door to this property is an abandoned construction site, which locals use as dump. As a result it smells badly (remember the AC smell? That's where it was coming from) and hosts miriads of mosquitos and flies (hence, mosquito nets). Flies were so annoying, we could hardly finish our breakfast.The pool was very small and ugly-looking because of concrete wall behind it. The staff spoke worst English I have experienst on Bali. But the biggest joke was so-called SPA. Imagine an old massage table in the locker room of a college sport hall? Well, this SPA looks exactly the same way. Yet, they charge for massage more than four star hotel next door.Overall, I would not recommend staying at this hotel. If it was located in the backpackers' Kuta it would be just fine. But it doesn't fit in Benoa/Nusa Dua where people spend much more money on the room but expect much better standards. BTW, the price of the so-called VILLA is as much as room in the four star Melia Benoa next door.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR725323057", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "GREAKLY"}, {"Content": "definitly the place for relax, it is so pleaceful       Ocean Villa", "Date": "Sep 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR853980929", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jjrobert"}, {"Content": "\u7ec9\u4f75\u4f04\u7039\u6c2c\ue196\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(19929586, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 15, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR967330779", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191333-d584350-r12443300-Benoa_Beach_Front_Villas_Spa-Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "584350", "Price": "$85"}}
