My special requests (boxes, packing materials, etc.) have always been well-handled and punctual. The neighborhood has shifted to a more pedestrian-friendly mentality, just outside South Kensington tube station. Wide array of restaurants in immediate area, from high-end Thai to common desires like Starbucks and Pret a Manger. The rooms are all unique, though appointed in a similar manner, and the \"build\" is immaculate... strong, sturdy, and very English! The bathrooms are maintained to an astounding level of cleanliness, and are basically beautiful granite floors and walls with rich walnut wood trims. The ---quality--- of literally everything is some of the finest I've seen... bed linens, towels, amenities, etc. If room size is your priority, enquire in advance and book appropriately, as my last room was HUGE! Quiet and lovely, private and peaceful. You cannot expect a huge room if you are paying for the least-expensive option, in my opinion. I would describe the hotel and experience there as \"traditional English\" which is great is that is your desire. It is not a clean-lined, modern hotel... a touch frilly but if you want a boring chain hotel, look elsewhere.

Upon entry I was shown to the drawing room. Warm, cosy and littered with luxurious furniture, artworks, dark oak panelled walls and an honesty bar, the room was a complete contrast to the sunny weather outside and I could see myself sitting by the coal fire on a cold winters evening with a good book and a glass of red.

The hotel is beautifully designed with traditional and modern elements blended together very eloquently. The room that we stayed in was very well configured with everything in the right place. The brunch in the morning was also great value for money and of a good quality standard. Overall we had a great experience but there were a couple of areas of improvement that if the hotel takes notice of this review, will help to increase the overall customer experience. As after all, it is classified as a 5-star luxury boutique hotel. The first customer service hiccup was when we went to the bar/restaurant to order drinks. When we requested a Bloody Mary, the barman had no idea how to make it and had to ask the Restaurant Manager. We had to wait for around 15 minutes until someone could figure out how to make one of the world's most easiest drinks. The same barman also recommended that I order a Campari Spritz. I live in Italy so I know what this drink should taste like. The one that was served to me was watery with not kick and served in a huge tumbler. Not exactly the taste and presentation I was expecting. The second customer hiccup was on New Years Day when we were checking out. We had decided to book a reservation for the in-laws for their upcoming trip to London. I had previously checked the rates on the hotel website of which there was a 3for2 promotion. I decided it was easier to make the reservation face-to-face but reception was unable to give me the same promotion on her reservation system. Clearly, they have problems with rate parity. I therefore made the booking online in the end. The same receptionist also looked as though she hadn't come home from the night before. Her uniform was completely creased and her hair looked liked a huge bird's nest. Her nails were painted electric pink which were grotesque and vulgar to look at. When I told her that she should iron her jumper, she replied \" Oooh....I know\" in such a ditsy manner. And this is the public image of a 5 star hotel??? Clearly this poorly trained girl needs to move to a back-of-house job instead. So apart from those two encounters, I am willing to return the Pelham with pleasure. I just hope that on my next visit, there is a barman that knows how to make cocktails and receptionist that is able to use an iron and maybe look at herself in the mirror from time-to-time.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deal, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous but ruined by cool reception\u201d", "Author": "Dealight", "ReviewID": "UR123405086", "Content": "Perfect location for V&A and Harrods.

It's one block away from the Natural History Museum, and two from the Victoria and Albert, which are both free (no small gift to the London visitor!) and hold splendid collections. It's a seven-minute walk from Hyde Park, and if you have an ample budget, fifteen minutes away from Harrods and Harvey Nichols and all of Knightsbridge. The Pelham is beautifully appointed: understated elegance finds a real expression here. (Incidentally, we were initially concerned by other reviews about the rooms being noisy. We had a room right on Cromwell, on the second floor (third, in the US), and were never bothered by noise, despite being really light sleepers.)

The staff were all lovely and tried hard, however, you got the impression that they did not have the level of managment oganization that could help them do any better. The food was disappointing. Menu appealed - french style, sufficient choices without being overbearing. However, the food was more of a home cooked french style standard than that of a top chef. This might explain why there was no problem getting a table in the evenings. Breakfast was adequate to good, but again more good cooking than bonne cuisine. The staff at breakfast were disorganized, badly managed and inefficient. The staff in the evening were able as they were never serving more than two tables, but lacked real understanding. The cost of our room price doubled with all the extras. There was service, vat, service on the restaurant/wine bills, fee to park the car and so on. Whilst the car park fee was fair enough for central London, the overall additions on the bill toppled up the final charge. So the \u00a3210 weekend rate room became with breakfast and dinner/wine \u00a3450 a night. For that kind of money I expect much better food, and managment.

We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, and overall it was a great hotel. It's a charming block of townhouses in central London that feels more like a home than a cookie cutter, corporate hotel. The room we stayed in was very large, especially by London standards, and extremely clean with a fantastic cleaning staff with good timing. The room had all of the upscale amenities expected such as a flatscreen tv, wireless hi-speed internet access (this was a bit pricey at 20 GBP/day, so we only used this ), large bathroom, mini-bar, bathrobes, etc. The staff was very friendly and helpful; they were there when we needed them, but otherwise greatly respected our privacy. A few things we noted. The bathroom, which is a recently renovated marble/granite, had a great shower and Aveda products. However, the layout of the bathroom made it almost impossible to get out of the tub/shower easily. The tub/shower did not have a curtain or a door, instead there was a glass pane that blocked half of the tub. The other half of the tub where you could get out was blocked by the toilet. If you're handicapped in any way, or afraid of slipping in the tub/shower, then this most likely won't work for you. It's a minor inconvenience, that I think only affects a few rooms. The location of the hotel is great, across the street from the South Kensington Underground stop. The stop is fantastic for the Piccadilly, Circle, and District lines which can take you straight to Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus, Westminster Abbey, Tower of London, etc. The surrounding neighborhood is very busy, and there is a lot of construction going on on the streets surrounding the hotel, so a room away from the street (which ours luckily was) will really help cut the traffic noise. While the neighborhood is perfectly safe, we weren't too keen on the traffic or congestion surrounding the hotel. Within the hotel, there was very little noise from the hallway, and virtually no noise from the other rooms. I felt our room was a cozy place away from all of the chaos of the surrounding neighborhood. The Pelham is a bit pricey, but we found a great online deal so definitely search the travel sites for a reservation before going straight to the hotel's website to make a reservation. It may be more money than other London hotels, but you'll be guaranteed a classy hotel close to a highly convenient tube stop, and a clean, cozy, quiet upscale room.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vienna", "Title": "\u201cLovely !\u201d", "Author": "lin23", "ReviewID": "UR25746599", "Content": "Just opposite the South Ken. tube station, or few minutes walk from the V&A museum the Pelham has a wonderful location.

Even though the hotel is located at a busy intersection, we didn't hear a thing because of the double windows. The location is incredible - directly across the street from South Kensington tube stop, so a straight shot on the line from Heathrow (35 minute ride or so) and into the city center (ten minute ride), and only two blocks from the Victoria and Albert and Natural Science museums (both of which are fantastic). It's just a short walk to Kensington Garden, and some of the fantastic shops, restaurants, and bars. Also a nice neighborhood to go for a walk and check out some of the Georgian crescents and homes. Our room was incredibly clean. The chocolates, water, and cool bottled water were nice touches. They remembered to bring an extra pair of slippers for my sister, too. The beds were really comfortable, the heat was easy to control, there is tons of closet space, and the bathroom is enormous (great shower heads)! The only thing I'd change is adding ventilation to the bathroom since it gets really foggy in there (since the shower is so incredible I took long ones). The hotel staff is down to earth, perky, and helpful. Angelika, in particular, was extremely accomodating and sweet. The doormen and concierge(s) jumped to help us with anything and everything, and were very patient. They stowed our bags when we got in early in the morning before check-in, and after we checked out on our last day in town since our flight was at night. Also, as soon as I mentioned we were planning to go to dinner one of the nights, the concierge recommended several great options (check out Shikara, an Indian restaurant a few blocks away - doesn't look like much but the food is incredible) and called to make us a reservation - without even having to ask! We had continental breakfast at the Bistro every morning (it was included in the price of our room) and it was a great way to start the day. The service was friendly and quick, too! I loved the look of the entire hotel - each bedroom is decorated differently, with clean, bold colors, and the bistro is cute and eclectic, and the lounge and library are funky but classic. Great artwork everywhere. Both of the common rooms are comfortable to relax in, even with other guests, and the honor bar was a great touch (although another guest tried to sneak a few drinks onto our room's bill late one night after we left, the front desk staff was quick to remove the charges). The staff also wears really cute matching clothes - so understated you almost don't notice, but when you do it's even more impressive. Fresh flowers, nice smells, very clean spaces.

When I returned in December for a vacation, I was glad to see that the warm atmosphere remained, but that the decor had been updated from an excess of prints (think leopard skin) to a cleaner, more modern aesthetic. I fell in love with the place all over again. Positives: 1. Warm and welcoming staff and public spaces. When you have a drink in the drawing room and library, you feel like you're in your own home. 2. Lovely room design that combines the best of modern crispness with traditional cosiness. Extremely comfortable beds. 3. Excellent location across the street from the South Kensington tube station, serving the District, Circle and Piccadilly lines. Getting anywhere in London is fast and easy. A block away from the V&A museum. Lots of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. 4. Varied clientele: tourists, business, American, local -- and not just young fashionistas clad in black. Negatives: 1. Odd lapses in the room design. The first room we booked had room for a small sofa, but instead the space was filled with a long and high dresser flanked by two less-than-comfy chairs. We upgraded, but maybe that was the point? There's a lack of counter space in the bathrooms (otherwise spacious); somehow the ledge above the toilet wasn't an appealing place to put my cosmetics. 2. Lack of technology. No iPod dock; not even an alarm clock on the bedside table. And why do European boutique hotels instead on high per diem charges for Internet access?

There were two drawing rooms on the ground floor where I ordered tea for myself and a friend. I had one meal in the restaurant, and it was very good. The location is right across from the South Kensington tube station, so you can get anywhere. It's a five minute walk to the Victoria & Albert museum. Two complaints: (1) I couldn't take a shower without flooding the bathroom. The configuration of the shower enclosure was faulty. (2) Use of the laptop computer in the \"library\" was contingent on purchasing an Internet card. It was 10 GBP for one hour. I used five minutes the first day, and the next day I was told my time had expired. The front desk people told me I had not logged off. The next time I did everything but shut down the computer, and it still used all my time. The hotel needs to find a better way for guests to access the Internet.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Staff\u201d", "Author": "drinkingfashionista", "ReviewID": "UR7266715", "Content": "I stayed here for business last month and I was very happy with my stay.

There are nice common rooms in the reception with free computer with internet. The area surrounding the hotel is nice although a bit off.

We stayed a week at The Pelham. The rooms were nice but not exceptionally charming or well appointed. We booked the highest category room that wasn't a suite. The concierge dropped the ball, and also gave us incorrect information, several times when we asked for help with booking requests. We found the room service and restaurant food to be mediocre to good, but mostly tasteless. The restaurant was strange; very sterile and empty. There was no place to put the room service food in the room - it always came on a tray with plates stacked up. We had to eat standing up, or put our plates on the bed. There were no glaring problems, but nothing special, either.

We had no warning of this beforehand. Charged 40% extra upfront for possible extras - again no warning before arrival. Room too warm. Two visits from concierge to no avail. Too noisy to open window. Moved us to room at back of hotel - we could open a window, so temperature OK, but cigarette smoke from adjacent rooms infiltrated. No concern for global warming here - overall hotel temp could be turned down, there were 2 lights on in our room on arrival and after maid did her evening round. Heated towel rail. Minibar fridge emitting much heat. Breakfast superb - fresh fruit, freshly squeezed juices, range of cereals, soya milk available without special request. Spoiled by music over intercom.
