We booked two rooms one for me, my husband and 2yr old son and one for our moms. Not sure where to start from. Our experience with Acra and it's staff was unforgettable. From booking in US, than the pickup at the airport to our last goodbye with the staff standing outside waving us goodbye. Check-in was fast and very helpful. They don't have room service but people at front desk were willing to help us with anything we asked for such as milk for my son or ordering pizza from dominos with a deal. He did it all and my mother in-law even said, \"this feels like home.\" Breakfast: It was a buffet with fresh eggs, breads, olives and other turkish delights to cereal etc. Everything one might need to have a complete satisfying start of the day. Staff at the breakfast was very helpful. I had to make instant oatmeal my son and they let me use their microwave in the kitchen and anything I needed. Location: It's perfectly located in the Old town. A short walk to Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque and Grand bazaar. Yet it's away from the loud streets where tourists are shopping. Rooms: Rooms are VERY CLEAN and big enough for you. We had two strollers, three suite cases and a crib but we still were easily moving around the place. Sheets are soft. I'm very big about the bedding and the bathroom and I was happy with both. They have elevator and that was a huge thing for us because most of the boutique hotels don't have elevators. Also they provided us with a complimentary one way pickup from the airport. Overall this hotel has the standards of a FIVE STAR but because they are a boutique hotel they can't rate as a five star. I would say DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON FOUR SEASONS OR ANYTHING ELSE BOOK ACRA. I would've listed names of the staff that helped but I can't give one or two names.

The hotel is perfectly located on a quiet street in Sulthanamet, close to Hagia Sofia and Blue Mosque (around 5 minutes on a lazy walk). First of all, I have to say the staff is great - very friendly and helpful. As we arrived early in the morning, they arranged a few rooms for us before check-in time, in order to leave our luggages. In the mean time, we were served with tea or coffee. Then, they arranged for us a cruise trip over the Bosphorus at a resonable price. When we came back, there was a cake buffet in the lobby - and I must say the buffet is served daily, in the afternoon, with tea and sweets. Rooms were spacious, nice furbished - with a touch of oriental style, very clean (as seen in the official hotel's pictures). They were provided with flat TV screen, tea corner, minibar, safe box and all the necessary in the bathroom. The ones in upper floor had nice view over the sea or Sulthanamet. Breakfast was good, with sweets, turkish food, different kinds of cheese and even two tipes of comb with honey. We really enjoyed our stay and they were even kind enough to let us check-out later, as our flight was in the afternoon and there were rooms available.

It is indeed a very central and lively, yet quiet spot in Istanbul. On to the hotel: It is in the style of a cozy Turkish-style \"mansion\" and is located midst of an homely district, which gives you a feeling to literally live in Istanbul even though it's only for the time being. The ENTIRE STAFF of the hotel is very professional, extremely friendly and they will go out their way to fulfill one's demands, whether it is in arranging a city tour, giving you precisely intro about the city itself and to call a pizza service for you! At any time of the day you will be (at least) offered a glass of turkish tea or coffee and that free-of-charge! The rooms are tastefully furnished and quiet spacious and as well as the bathroom. Housekeeping is doing an excellent job by keeping the rooms in a great and tidy shape. THE MATTRESSES ARE VERY COMFORTABLE! I have never in my life slept so well on mattress, leave alone in a hotel! Breakfast has a large variety of food; from local (turkish) delicacies to international dishes. Last, but not least, the hotel even has its own cat (I called it Garfield, because it has a brownish / orange fur and is very cute). PLEASE CONTACT MS. OZLEM, who is the hotel manager and she will support you as much as she can. She answers emails almost immediately (same day response is a guarantee) and she is taking care of individual preferences. There is only 1 thing that I want to mention here to look out for: if you are a sensitive person, please let the hotel know to give you a \"quiet\" room. I had a corner room and was extremely happy with it, although I am very noise sensitive and we even had a view of the sea :) I will be a repeating guest for sure!!!

It's a newer hotel, that was one of our main reasons to choose and also walking distance to many attractions, however its a 10 min. walk to the tram station.

Bathrooms were nice and very clean with ample toiletries, good water pressure in the shower and were cleaned and updated with towels daily.

Location : Perfect. It is within 5 minutes walk to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern and Topkapi Palace. The tram and restaurants are also around the Blue Mosque area so the location is convenient. However, take note of the shops around the area, some of them are out to make as much from you as possible so I'd recommend checking out the prices elsewhere(ie, near the tram, Grand Bazaar or Spice Bazaar) before buying anything there. Despite all the amenities nearby, the hotel is on a quiet street so that was very good. Room : We were put on a room on the ground floor on the first couple of days but was told to move to another room on the 2nd floor. We prefer the room on the 2nd floor as the room on the 1st floor was very noisy ie. there was a dog at the hotel next to Acra and that dog kept barking the whole day and night! The 2nd floor room was slightly smaller but much nicer. Both rooms were cosy and perfect if you are on your honeymoon. I love the colour theme and furniture. :-) The bed is super comfy - reminds me of the beds at a certain 5 star Hotel chain - but it's smaller ie. Queen sized. We're used to King size bed but we find the bed as comfy. The airconditioner is good and the bathroom a good size. However, it would be better if there is a hand bidet as well. Overall I was impressed with the room. Food : Breakfast was served at the lovely basement. The food was almost the same everyday but I didn't mind that. The cakes served during breakfast and tea are to die for - I've never tasted cakes this good even at 5 star hotels in and outside of Singapore. The hotel provide cakes and tea in the afternoon at the lobby for free. That was really thoughtful and it was wonderful to come back and have a slice of the lovely cakes. Service : The 2 Mesut, Lale and the other staff were very helpful. Mesut offered us free breakfast when we arrived in the morning and showed us a map of Istanbul and showed us where the places of interest are. That was really thoughtful and kind of him. We didn't get that kind of service even at most 5 star hotels! The staff were ready to give us information and always ask us how our days were. The staff will never fail to greet you when they see you. However, I must add that we were a bit upset when we were told to change room and nobody apologize for that even though it's really inconvenient to pack all our things and to unpack them again afterwards. I felt that could be handled better. The good thing was that they kept their promise that the room was just as good - actually in fact, we preferred the 2nd room. Others : The hotel has free wi-fi. We had no trouble surfing the internet from our laptop and phones. The facade and lobby of the hotel were cosy and nicely decorated. Elegant but not ostentatious. The hotel does not have rooftops like the other hotels nearby but would you rather a bigger room or a rooftop? All in all, I'd say it was an enjoyable stay at Acra Hotel. I'd recommend Acra Hotel and I'd definitely stay there when we come to Istanbul again.

These guys are able to make the difference: we had a problem in the bathroom they solved it, we were in the need of directions to dine-out they were able to provide really good option nearby. Furthermore room service was good during all our stay. Furthermore a really nice idea is the tea around 5pm. A really valuable idea if you come after a cold and rainy day, you may have some relax before going out for dinner with a tea and some pastries. A suggestion while booking: room rates on standard booking websites were higher than on Acra website. Contact them directly (by email or phone) to get a better understanding of the different room options (family, with views, ...) ... and of the rates Price: probably is not the most cost effective hotel in Sulthanhamet, but I think it can provide a good value for your money A couple of minus: Breakfast: lot of food, but sometimes the bread for the toast was not so fresh, one morning they were proposing a cake, the morning after we were served with the slices of the same cake, we found an insect in the honey, the pears were hard like stones ... so probably they should put some effort on improving breakfast, since they claim to be a four stars hotel!

The usual line up of juices, coffee, tea, cereals, olives, cold meats and cheeses you find in Europe, and a small selection of hot dishes, Turkish style, some cakes and breads. Cooked eggs are provided but you won't find the egg stations you find in Asia. The fruit was divine though - fresh peaches and plums were a highlight. Complimentary water was not replenished after the first day, despite the notice in the bathroom that the water is not safe to drink. So this was a minor irritant - minor because water was easily available on the street, and very cheap. I'm sure if we'd remembered to ask, it would have been provided.

Although most were friendly they lacked a genuiness we found in other smaller hotels. One woman was very unhelpful. Due to a mix up with dates we ended up spending 1 night a Hotel Sari Konak. It is a stones throw away. We stayed in a suite at Hotel Sari Konak which was very nice but the room could not compare to Acra. The Hotel Sari Konak had the advantage of a fabulous roof top terrace with great views of the Blue Mosque and the Sea of Marmara. The breakfast food is fine but not as good as Acra however. We enjoyed our stay in Istanbul but were disappinted with the food. Definately worth going to Bar 360. We took the shorter boat trip on the Bosphorous. It does not go as far but takes about 2 hours and goes at a nice slow pace near the shore, allowing you to better to see the sights rather than zig zag up the Bosphorous (which the main ferry does). We used the tram regularly and found the Akbil tag useful and cheaper. You can get Akbil at little booth/shops near the tram stops. You do not need 1 each- just swip it once for each person.

There was no hotel restaurant (although they do serve breakfast in the basement floor) and there was no roofdeck that many of the other local hotels have.

Breakfast was served in a spacious dining area and was adequate for a city break. Many good restaurants surround the area( we liked Rammi the most).

Just make sure to email them your itinerary 24 hours in advance and arrange for pick up. The driver was at the airport already when we came out of customs and immediately had us in the car and on our way to the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted with smiles by Hasan. It was tea time in the afternoon, and at the hotel lobby they had a spread of snacks and rolls with delicious flavors of Turkish tea and coffee for all guests that we were able to enjoy. We had reserved a Superior Double Room, and we were given a room on the top - 4th floor. Although the immediate view was of other buildings and hotels, we had a partial sea view of the Bosphorus. The room itself was immaculate. Very clean, new, spacious, well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was super clean, in excellent condition and the shower was amazing. Coffee/Tea maker, hair dryer, and basic toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap were all provided in the room even though we had brought our own. The rooms do not have an iron, and you need to call the front desk to \"loan\" you one for use, which they take back when another room requests for it. The room had free Wi-Fi which made it easy to stay connected and check your email and stuff. The room also had a thermostat to control heating and cooling so you can set the temperature of your room which was great and a mini bar/fridge. The housekeeping staff is amazing as well. They went out of their way every day to keep the room tidy and did a great job. As others have mentioned, the hotel provided complimentary breakfast buffet every mooring on the ground floor. It was a decent spread of eggs, crepes, sausages, cheeses, home made jams, rolls, breads, cereals. It was great to get you going and energized for the day without having to wander out on the streets every morning searching for a breakfast place. Location, location, location - the hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of all the major Old City sites - Blue Mosque, Agia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Arasta Bazaar, Grand Bazaar, Sultanahmet Tram station, Bascilica Cistern and some amazing restaurants, cafes and pubs. Taksim Square was about a 10 minute ride away and costs around 15 Lira to get to. Spice Bazaar/Sulemanye Mosque were about the same. We were recommended by Hasan to try the Turquoise Restaurant on our first night and the food was great there. I would also recommend having some tea/snacks along with a Hookah/Water Pipe at Cafe Mesale and enjoying seeing a free Dervish dance there with live Turkish music from 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM. Its a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Last but not least, is to mention the hotel staff. Hasan, Lale, Mehmet, Oguz (Oz), Mesut were all very helpful and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and helped us with our day to day planning and make recommendations. Kudos and cheers to all you guys. We plan on returning soon and would recommend Acra to our friends and families as a great place to stay when visiting Istanbul.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Victoria", "Title": "\u201cSENSATIONAL HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "fitzfloyd", "ReviewID": "UR88601069", "Content": "What a wonderful hotel the Acra is.

The hotel is wonderful value and I definitely would like to stay there again: Istanbul has become my favorite city in the whole world! We stayed at a similar grade hotel in Sultanahmet when we first arrived on our holiday and while it too was lovely, it was much more expensive than the Acra. The Acra is great value. You won't need to catch taxis if you stay in Sultanahmet as many of the major sites are nearby. For those which are not, it's easy to catch the nearby tram, or use one of the public ferries on the Bosphorus or Sea of Mamara.

Not too many hotels can boast of discovering an architectural heritage while their foundation was being dug, but the Acra sure can.\u00c2\u00a0 The breakfast buffet has a good mix of Turkish and Continental cuisine - we particularly loved the servings of fresh honey at breakfast. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The rooms are adequately sized and tastefully done up. The ones on the 2nd floor (room nos 402 etc) have a good view of the surrounding are including the Blue Mosque.

Of course Mesut was considerate enough to ask if we were hungry and proceeded to not only make a reccommendation, but also to arrange for pick up and drop off at the restaurant and make the reservations for us. Mesut was working the night shift our entire stay and we relied on him for all of our dinner reccommendations, which were all absolutely fantastic. One night he insisted that he walk with us to show us where the restaurant is as opposed to merely giving us directions. If Mesut is working make sure you get his reccommendation for dinner.

After the Taxi drive from Ataturk Airport I was greeted by the warm and friendly staff at Acra hotel at the door. They welcomed me with huge smiles and made me feel welcome straight away. Hasan one of the members of staff was particularly helpful and even drew me a map of the city centre so that I wouldn't get lost during my travels. I have been to many hotels before and have never come across such a friendly, attentive and co-operative member of staff. I had a superior single room decorated with Ottoman style furnishings overlooking the lively city. I can be quite a cynic when it comes to cleanliness in hotel rooms but I have to say that the room smelt of Jasmines when I walked in and cleaners were always around throughout my stay. I was pleased to find that I had wireless access in my bedroom and was able to check my emails whenever I wanted to. Breakfast was served buffet style with a rich variety of Mediterranean delicacies, cheeses, breads, pastries, several ranges of salami, stuffed olives and natural marmalades known as recel. I also found myself fall in love with the traditional Turkish bread called 'simit' which is similar to a bagel and can be eaten alongside the above mentioned. The location of the hotel couldn't have been any better as it was a very short distance away from all of the city's main historical sites. Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque and Grand Bazaar were all a short walk away, I absolutely loved the convenience of being able to pop into my hotel room and back out again to continue with my sight visits. Thanks to Hasan's hand drawn map and useful advice I was able to delve into the city and explore its heritage, culture and all of the Ottoman ruins.

The breakfast was also outstanding for a European continental breakfast - two types of eggs, six different cereals, lots of fruit, jams, meats and cheeses, juice - all included in the price. My only complaint is the thin walls (and windows). Our first morning (a Friday) we were awakened by the call to prayer at 5.30. I recognise that this is probably common in Istanbul, and especially given the proximity to the Blue Mosque. So that's forgivable. However, we could hear every word of the family next door, including their lovely crying baby, and even when they were talking in normal voices. We asked if we could change rooms and were told that the only room available had two twin beds.

We complained the first night and was moved. The second room was the same. We were told that the room was occupied by a single person.

The breakfast buffet was simple, but fresh, well presented and tasty - and set in a lovely room built around some Byzantine (I think!) ruins. The hotel itself is in a fantastic location being only a few minutes' walk away from some of Istanbul's biggest tourist attractions such as Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque, whilst at the same time being tucked away in a quiet enough street so that you're not disturbed by any crowds (OK - it was January). We found it very easy to get to all of the city's tourist attractions as if they weren't in walking distance, the tram stop was only a 7 minute walk away. Finally, the staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough to help. We'd definitely go back to this hotel on a future visit to Istanbul.", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cFacinating culture and landscape\u201d", "Author": "thegreatgatesofkiev", "ReviewID": "UR54974483", "Content": "The Acra Hotel is located in the Sultanahmet area of old Istanbul described as a boutique hotel.

The hotel is renovated with qualities of old colonial charm embellished with ceiling roses, chandeliers and wrought iron banisters along the stairs. The breakfast is simple and adequate.

Due to the size of our group, we organized to have cakes and beverages available during the afternoon for a reasonable cost and they made the goodies available till about 10 pm at night.

CONS: if I really had to mention something, I would say that if you are visiting in the summer, you may be disappointed by the lack of a roof terrace for breakfast (we were there in Dec so it didn't really matter), but you can always enjoy a coffee on one of the gazillion cafes/hotels nearby whenever you want!

After showing my dissatisfaction, we were given a Superior triple room (very puzzling as a moment ago, we were told that all triple rooms were all occupied). - Due to cancellation of our internal flights by the airport, we had to change our plans, so I checked with the reception and was told that we can stay in our room for 2 more nights by the night shift person at the reception. However, the morning shift person at the reception told us that we have to move out as our room has been allocated to others. After some arguments, she told us to stay put in our room. Eventhough the hotel is only 6 months old, it is beginning to show some signs of aging. The bathroom water does not flow properly and the tub is always flooded when we bathe. We told the reception about the problem and was told it had been fixed. We lived with the flooded bathtub until we checked out as we do not want to complaint anymore.
