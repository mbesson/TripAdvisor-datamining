I stayed on the top floor (3) in building 3 - and I loved how spacious the room was, not to mention the great balcony and very, VERY comfortable bed. Bathroom was nice too, and had two sinks. I was here on business, and it was great to have free, ample parking, as well as a very nice and always-available banquet staff. The food was very good.

I chose this hotel due to it's location and it's comfortable beds. However, I had an issue with my bed. When I checked into my room, one side of the bed was well worn. The springs squeaked very loudly when I sat on it and the mattress sagged quite badly. This led me to sleep on the other side of the bed only which made it difficult for me. When I notified the front desk that night, the woman listened to my concern, told me she would follow up with the manager but nothing happened. When I received a call on Thursday asking me how my stay was I again told them my bed had issues and this person tried to rectify it. They checked it out and said it was fine but they would move me to another room anyway. I declined the offer due to the fact that I was travelling with a companion staying in the room next door who required additional assistance. Along with the bed issue, room service had a lot to be desired in this hotel. The person who brought up the food was quite surly and I felt uncomfortable. Besides the subjective, I did not receive all the things I ordered half the time I ordered room service. I would consistently have to call back to arrange for the missing items to be delivered. This was particularly noticable as the weekend approached. The room service food was acceptable but nothing to write home about. The bathroom area has very little counter space and although I do not travel with a lot of toiletries, I had issue placing all the things I did bring on the counter. The housekeeping service was quite good and as always the cookies were phenomenal. I even brought home a tin, however only half of them actually entered my apartment.

We were lucky that they were on the same timetable as us, and not rambunctious. Otherwise, this would have been a major issue.

The hotel staff was very understanding but told me there was little they could do as they weren't staffed to properly handle the number of unruly guests they had at the hotel these two evenings. Unfortunately, my wife got very sick while we were there(not due to the noise), but the staff was, again, very helpful and the restaurant even prepared chicken soup for her even though it wasn't on the menu.

I especially liked the bathroom. Paying $5.95 a day for internet access when at most hotels its gratis, not so much. However, I was on the ground floor and there was a moisture problem in the room. It had a musty, urine smell and could have benefited from some form of dessicant ( moisture control ). The Pool: I did not swim in the pool but did stop by and look at it. It is a nice pool but not spectacular. It is small and seems out of scale to the acreage this hotel occupys. Perhaps that is why you can not find a picture of the pool anywhere on the web site.

The plumbing wasn't great - my tap made a loud groaning noise, and whenever any of my neighbours used the bathroom ... I knew all about it. Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment: the same fairly limited buffet every day. The set-up seemed to cope with general guests just fine - on my last two days, the conference was over, and the breakfast room was leisurely, and the staff efficient and attentive. When the conference was running, and 80 people were trying to turn up for breakfast between 7 and 8 am, everything went to pieces: the buffet ran out of food, my table got cleared away whenever I went back the buffet (I lost my newspaper most days, and my hot cup of coffee vanished once). The bar offered drinks and food in the evening. The range of beers was good, but the food was unimpressive, and I had possibly the worst pizza of my life there. By contrast, the conference catering was excellent: it was plentiful, with a wide choice, lots of variety, different every day, and high quality. Clearly this is organised by quite a different chef! There is free wireless throughout the hotel, as well as a wired connection in the bedroom. The coverage is good, but the back-haul network got very congested (perhaps because my conference colleagues are all high-tech bods who would be hammering it hard): after the conference was over, the network speed was fine! The hotel is in a poor location if you haven't got a car. There are a few strip malls nearby-ish, offering lots of burger joints. A few slightly better restaurants are in walking distance, too. A bus at the end of the road goes into downtown San Diego - $2.50 for an hour's ride, every hour or half-hour. I'm not a golfer, so I didn't use the golf course. The \"fitness center\" was a little disappointing, though for a hotel it probably deserves about 7/10: at least there were some reasonable weight dumbells and basic universal weight machines. The pools looked good - both a lap pool, and a leisure pool, but I didn't try them out.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York", "Title": "\u201cDecent stay but could do better\u201d", "Author": "GP_NY", "ReviewID": "UR32840227", "Content": "Spent 6 nights here while visiting family who lived in the area.

The resort is located right off a major freeway intersection (Hwy 15 - sort of a route 66 for the San Diego to Las Vegas travelers and Rte 56 which links the east half of San Diego with the west half that runs along Hwy. 5). On the other side of Hwy 15 directly across from the resort is a large outdoor shopping complex with just about every familiar store and restaurant. Right across the street from the hotel is an Albertson's grocery store, 7-11 and Office Depot. The golf course is set alongside Hwy 15 and the resort itself is set down the hill a bit with views of the mountains so you forget you are in an urban area. I don't play golf so I won't comment on its merits except it looked nice from the restaurant and bar. The resort is sprawling and you have to stroll outdoors up and/or down steps to the Fitness Center, etc...(it is a golf/health resort in San Diego), but with the big shady trees, landscaped walks and gentle breezes, strolling the resort is a welcomed treat for tourist or businessman. The pools and whirlpool were surrounded by large shade trees. I can't believe some people were complaining about leaves and flower petals (actually red bouganvilla which has to be the offical flower of San Diego, its everywhere) that would fall around or into the pool, everyone I talked to thought it was like an island paradise. Everything seemed to be nestled into its own niche up and away from noise and traffic and parking. For those complaining about carrying your bags a little further to one of the niches or up stairs, well stop complaining, it means you're out of shape and you've come to the right place.

The rate I booked actually was not very expensive in my opinion. At first when we arrived I was a little disappointed.

And since it was also 100 degrees most of the weekend, many were inside with their air-conditioning cranked up. It's a very quiet place -- everyone seems to respect everyone else's privacy. The layout of the grounds is unusual. First off there is a lodge of modern construction where you can room if you choose. Then there are 20 small two-story villa-like buildings -- each one divided into either six or eight suites--each suite with its own entrance door. One reviewer below was correct that if your villa is located far from the parking lots, you have quite a way to cart your luggage. Also, the villas have no elevators, so if your suite is on the second floor, you also cart your luggage up the steps (that's very European!). By the way, parking here is $8 a night -- more if you require a valet. My suite appears to have been closed up for some time and smelled musty, so I invested in a bottle of Fabreze at a local convenience store which took care of the problem. Otherwise, everything seemed to be in working order.
