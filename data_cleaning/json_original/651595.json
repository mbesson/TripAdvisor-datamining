We only planned on spending a minimal amount of time in the Hotel, and this hotel seemed to be perfectly located for quick access to the sights and restaurants - and it most definetely was. We flew to Tegel airport, and took the TXL bus into the centre. This hotel is a 400 metre walk from the Karlplatz bus stop (15-20 minutes on bus from airport) so no need for expensive airport taxis if you've not got too much luggage. Check in process was smooth and friendly, and we were in room, unpacked, and checking out the sights already about an hour after landing! The Room itself WAS small - but that didn't bother us - as i said - it was just a place to sleep. It was however well equipped, with everything you'd expect. The only obvious exception to this was a kettle and Tea / Coffee - not the end of the world however. Bathroom perfectly fine, and a great shower. Only 2 english speaking channels on the TV - again - not a problem. Wasn't going there to watch TV. The Hotel is only 20 mins walk from Reichstag / Brandenburg Gate, and 10 mins walk to the river Spree by Fredickstrabe with plenty of Bars and restaurants on the riverside. We even walked all the way to Alexanderplatz in 45 mins at a leisurly pace. Overall an Excellent location Breakfast was really good. Pretty Much everything you could want. Hot Bacon / Egg / Sausage, cold meats, cheeses, pastries, bread, cereals, fruit, smoked fish, juices, tea coffee. The breakfast room was very big, and although it was considerably busier over the Saturday and Sunday mornings that we were there was plenty of seating. The Hotel Bar was small but never busy when i visited, and also has two internet stations where we were able to book into our return flights and print boarding cards at no extra cost. Now - We stayed in a room on the first floor - When we opened our curtains on the first morning, we received a bit of a shock to see a man in a hospital bed in the building opposite looking straight into our room. After a bit of initial shock, we eventually asked reception what it was - The building opposite (an old WW2 bunker, and subsequent Cold War Bunker) houses a private art collection (The Boros Collection) - one of the exhibits is in fact by a famous Danish couple, and is in fact of a man in a hospital bed looking out of a Window - so don't be alarmed. We thought it was a bit of a nice talking point!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and great staff!\u201d", "Author": "Charlotte946", "ReviewID": "UR122021223", "Content": "Stayed here in September for a couple of nights.

Everything was very clean and the service at reception was good. Overall I had no serious complaints about the hotel the beds were comfortable, the rooms were well maintained, it wasn't shabby, there was nice touches like fruit in the room and we got a free breakfast.... but i have to consider the price vs. value... we paid around 100 euro a night and the place is basically a travelodge or premier inn with a nice breakfast. There were no tea or coffee making facitities in the rooms and the shower cubicle was the most bizarrre design i've ever seen - very open plan!! I was staying there with a friend and when either of us wanted a shower we had to leave the room or face the wall for the duration of the other persons shower because the shower is in the main sleeping room and has a clear glass door. Not ideal. The good thing was that there is free internet, so at least i could go and use that while my friend was showering! ;) The beer at the bar was terrible... the bar staff did not seem to know what they were doing and the beer i did get looked like an ice cream cone... also, the tv in our room had no channels, which was annoying when i wanted to watch something after a night out. The breakfast was fine. Nothing special, but fine, fresh and i have no complaints about that (apart from that there was no black tea for us English people!) The location is excellent, about a 3 minute walk to Freidrichestrasse station and from there you can connect to most areas of the city with ease.

Not much more, really, but everything was well maintained and perfect for what we were looking for. A place to crush after long days and nights enjoying Berlin. The hotel has a glass surface, so most of the room is a large window. The problem is that just beside it there is a huge WWII bunker, now owned by a media tycoon. And the huge concrete walls take a lot of light from some of the rooms. Still, with so much window surface, it never felt dark or depressive. It just felt weird. We never had breakfast at the place, mainly because a couple hundred meters down the street there was a bohemian caf\u00e9 serving a simple but great breakfast buf\u00e9 for 3\u20ac. That is a bargain, and the place was all decadent and trendy at the same time. On a funny note, we had a fire alarm one of the mornings we were there. At first we didn't understand, because the alarm consisted on a strange long german pre recorded message... but then we run down the stairs until the firemen checked it was only a false alarm in the kitchen.

The room was perfectly big enough for a short trip, although I think it would feel a little small for a couple staying for more than a few nights. The bathroom was open onto the room (toilet did have a door though), which was fine for me as I was travelling on my own.

However, the shower was large and clean, with great water pressure. For me, the best thing about this hotel was its location. Just a couple of minutes walk from Freidrichstrasse station for easy access to anywhere in Berlin, and within 20 minutes walk of the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate. In the evenings, Mitte is a great district to be in with loads of restaurants and bars. This hotel is just two blocks behind the river, with some lovely bars and restaurants with tables and chairs overlooking the river. I don't have any real complaints about this hotel.

Also, while the hotel offers free wifi access, you need to take your own laptop with you. The hotel has no computers available for business guests to check email, so I had to go to the internet cafe at Friedrichstrasse station. Next time, I would take my laptop with me and take advantage of the free wifi! I didn't try the hotel breakfast as it wasn't included in my room rate and cost 8 EURO!

There is a great Thai Restaurant across the road and a really nice man who runs a Dairy around the cnr for all your basic extras! A couple of small quirks but don\u2019t let this put you off A) Make sure your room door is shut as they need a little extra pull when closing behind you (we had friends in the next room and was the same) B) If you are sharing a room with another person make sure you know them well as the Bathrooms are \u2018Designer\u2019 and when you step out of the shower its not a private as you may like it to be. Reception staff mostly helpful but if things are too hard or they don\u2019t quite understand you, you get a straight \u2018No\u2019.

It's ideally located near Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse, from where there are connections all across the city (if you come from Tegel, take the Underground exit Oranienburger Strasse - it's closer). The Deutsche Theater is just around the corner. At the moment, there is still a construction site opposite, and the rooms are not 100% soundproof, although as the previous reviewer said, there are noisier places. One of the drawbacks is that the rooms are very small and that the toilets, while separate in contrast to the shower, are very basic. This whole bath area may have fashionable aspirations, bur is a bit reminiscent of en-suite student accommodation; perhaps an area they should have invested a bit more in.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cPrety good\u201d", "Author": "jmahon", "ReviewID": "UR10070029", "Content": "Good location , near Freidrichstrasse station.

The location of this hotle is perfect - it's about 200m from Fredrichdatrasse Station which is one of the major S Bahn and UBahn stations in Berlin. This measn that when you come from Schoenfeld Airport, the train stops about 200m before your hotel. Also if you want to get around Berlin it's very handy. One of the best places to eat in Berlin is Orangierstrasse which is about 10 min walk from the hotel. The pice of teh hotel was \u20ac47 per night plus breakfast at \u20ac8euros. The room, was new, clean and the bathroom facilities very good. There is a new building being erected acrsoos the road from the hotel, but this is not a big deal. There is also a 150 room 2nd Wold War bunker beside the ghotel which is a protected structure, and someone has built a very nice penthouse on top of it. The staff in the hotel are all yound and very helpful - I wanted to know where to go one night and asked the reception guy - I said I had a map - he said, and I quote, 'But I have a better map AND I have a marker' and proceeded to mark the route on a map he gave me. Some of these very German trains of thought ar e very amusing! I found the walking tours well worth while to do - brochures at hotel - don't forget that your watch needs to be an hour ahead or you miss it! Breaksfast was fine but a little basic. Somethimes they had one fruit e.g. mandarins, sometimes two (peaches and pineapple), they also have sliced ham, but this seems to be eaten first in teh morning. So if I were going back to BErlin I would stay at this hotel again. PS: Very good Indian Restaurant at top of Orangierstrasse - large but very fast service and high quality.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Hotel Berlin-Mitte", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d651595-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Hotel_Berlin_Mitte-Berlin.html", "Price": "$98 - $196*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Albrechtstrasse 25/Ecke Reinhardtstrasse</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10117</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "651595", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/21/fe/21fe230421c80974bee23ccb331d77886large.jpg"}}
