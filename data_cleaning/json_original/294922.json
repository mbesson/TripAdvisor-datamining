From the first instance, Obelisk staff impressed me and this impression gradually increased. Through out the whole trip they sincerely and correctly advice us events, places, functions, cruises and restaurants. I am personally thankful to Mr. Yasar Bolat and Dundar Guram who went out of way to show us the right way to explore the city where an anonymous tourist can't go without a an experienced tip. They have good contacts with all the major touring facilitators. Another attraction that I still missed is its rooftop restaurant from where an amazing view of Bosphorous bay is visible. Watching and capturing sunrise from east was a view that brought romance and colors. Location of Obelisk is closer to many Byzantine/ Ottoman landmarks and Marmara beach.

We were thankfully given a double room the following day but this issue should not have occurred in the first place. The towels in our first bathroom were dirty, with bits of soap and hair stuck on the hand towels. We also had a problem with ants, which the staff asked if we wouldn't mind keeping the ants until the morning so that someone else could help with the problem. When we asked if they had bug spray or cleaning material so that we could clean it myself they replied that they had no cleaner at the time. The walls of the hotel are paper-thin. From toilets flushing to phone calls and late night conversations, you could hear EVERYTHING that went on in the hotel. Many reviews claimed the breakfast was amazing, but we found the breakfast to be just average with no exceptional qualities (minus the rooftop view of the nearby sights). Service-wise (apart from the insect issue) the hotel was only average. The information they gave to us was the mainstream tourist traps with nothing really personal. The location is great if you are looking to stay in the tourist area (Sultanahmet) but it is one of about a hundred other hotels in the same location.

From the Obelisk you're within very easy walking distance to the main sites in the Sultanahmet area like the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, Sistern and Topkapi Palace. This is the tourist area, so on the walk you'll encounter a fair share of carpet and traditional Turkish art item stores and restaurants with sellers trying to get you to stop in. But if you have the right attitude, the shopkeepers will become like your friends after a while and they'll greet you with a hearty smile and hello whenever they see you pass by. It is a very solid hotel and an excellent value.I must mention an additional strong point: during our stay, Sultanahmat district had electricity blackout for 5 hours. The hotel has an emergency generator which started immediately. the air-condition was on but the lift did not work obviously because the generator cannot support it.

Location is great, just 5 minutes walk to the Blue Mosque and Agia Sophia, and the Grand Bazaar. That is all I can say, we were satisfied with the hotel and had a great Holiday.

The hotel is finished to a good standard and in a nice building. The highlight of the hotel is the restaurant on the top floor which overlooks the sea at one end and the blue mosque the other; this is where an excellent breakfast is served. We also ate a meal here on the first evening, taking advantage of the 20% discount for guests on the first night- the sea bass was very good and the serving staff friendly though the wine a little expensive. We did have some major issues with the hotel the main being the rudeness of some of the front of house staff especially a Mr [-] who consistently failed to acknowledge us and was very abrupt despite us staying in the hotel for 5 nights. The seconds and more minor point is that the Turkish bath is not included and costs 10 Euros- this appears to lead to the bath not being used and when looking at the facility it appeared to be used as a storage area. The free wifi is present but the signal was too weak to connect in our room on the 3rd floor. The air-conditioning was also poor in our room compared to other hotels we stayed in Turkey. The cleaning staff also had an annoying habit of cleaning your room while at breakfast so when you return to pick up your things to go out for the day you would get in their way.

Firstly, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. My room was a double superior and was clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet set me up for the day and there was a decent selection of hot foods like eggs, potatoes and cold meats, cheeses, cereals, breads and cakes. The view from the terrace took my breath away as there is an unadulterated sea view plus views of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia. Location wise, you couldn't be better placed. 5 minutes to the Blue Mosque walking and cross over the road to Hagia Sofia. Topkapi can be reached in under 10 mins. I walked to the Bazaar in about 15 minutes. The only thing that bothered me about the hotel is that the walls are really quite thin and I could hear people in the next room talking or taking showers or closing their room doors. The only other irritating thing about the hotel's locality are the local shopkeeper men who insist on luring you into their shops or who walk with you trying to chat you up. They are prevalent on the street leading to the bazaar at the top of the road from the hotel and they congregate around the main tourist sights. It is hard to avoid them and being a solo female traveller, this did put me on edge a little bit. A firm \"no\" is the best policy but, even then, it is sometimes hard to get this across to them. But this is nothing to do with the hotel which was just perfect. The other tip I can offer is to arrange airport shuttle through Istanbulairport24.com. The Best Western had offered me a pick up from Ataturk to the Hotel for 30 Euros. Istanbulairport24.com offered me a round trip service for 36 Euros which I took and it worked out really well.

I arranged for the hotel to pick us up from the airport (free of charge), which worked out perfectly. Unfortunately, due to the disaster that is Turkish Airlines, our luggage did not arrive in Istanbul with us. The hotel was very accommodating and provided my husband with a shaving cream and offered to get us deodorant.

The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The shower did not drain very well, but this was overlooked by the fact that we had hot water and good water pressure (I've read reviews that other hotels in this area aren't so lucky). We had a great view of the MarMara and the Blue Mosque. We were pretty jet lagged most of the trip (in bed most nights by 8pm), but were never once woken up by street noise. The wi-fi in the room was not the best, but this might be due to the fact that we were on the 3rd floor. I had to sit in front of our door it get decent reception. There was a computer in the lobby that we could have used had we really needed internet. We used the hotel car service to get back to the airport (25 euro).

The buffet breakfast was comprehensive and of a high standard. Of the three nights we stayed, the meal in the restaurant (one night) was actually the best. The view from the restaurant over the Sea of Marmara towards the Bosphorus was often obscured by sea mist, but was still impressive. From the side terrace, there is a super view of the Blue Mosque. Although the 5 times a day call to player was very loud in the town, it was unobtrusive in the hotel. Hardly heard from the room. The sea mist caused the nearby lighthouse to sound the foghorn throughout long periods of the night. This didn't bother me, but my partner's sleep was disturbed. The beds were firmer than we are used to. The weather in November was very mild and when the sea mist cleared we enjoyed blue skies and lovely views. Don't miss wandering onto the Galata Bridge over the Golden Horn, and that area of the riverfront. Fantastic atmosphere. The shop proprietors really become a nuisance trying to entice you into their shops or restaurants. Don't fall for the invitation to take a cup of tea in the shop. The friendly facade changes to sulleness when you don't buy. The carpet shops are to be avoided. The quality ceramic decorative plates and vases are beautiful but expensive.

It is within easy walking distance (5/6 mins) of the Mosque, Sultanahmet Park, Aya Sophia and Topkapi Palace, but be ready for rough and loosely cobbled streets and pavements that can be quite steep and stepped. Because the hotel is built on a hillside the lobby is below the entrance at street level and the only access is down a staircase. Once inside there is a small lift, frail people might find the outer lift doors fairly heavy to pull outward. The lift ends at the third floor so there is still a staircase to ascend to the roof restaurant/bar/terrace. For these reasons the hotel is not really suitable for disabled persons. The roof terrace has views towards the Blue Mosque higher up the hill but mostly towards the point where the Seaof Marmara narrows to become the Bosphorous, and across the water to the Asian side of Istanbul. My room was along a short corridor off the lobby. Although the view was nothing the poorly maintained building behind the hotel shielded me from railway noise. This was heard in the restaurant but was never obtrusive nor excessive as all trains were travelling slowly to stop/leave a nearby station. As my room was on the opposite side of the hotel to the mosque I was never troubelled by the calls to prayer. The room was adequately furnished, comfortable and kept clean. The bathroom had very modern and probably recent w.c. and an excellent shower easy to operate. You might want to bring a travel plug for the sink. There was a hairdryer and shaver socket. During the tourist day a street further up the hill becomes choked with a long and often stationary line of slowly moving tourist buses heading for Sultanahmet Park to drop off / pick up visitors. If you are using taxis to/from the hotel this can delay your driver and lead to variations in the metered price of the journey. For example a journey to the hotel from Ataturk Airport late on a weekday afternoon was caught up in this jam and cost just under 50 Turkish lira; The return journey the following Sunday just after 0900 hrs was fast undelayed and cost around 37 lira. I ate in the hotel restaurant every evening as I was travelling alone, but there are plenty of alternatives nearby. The restaurant serves mostly Turkish style food but I found the variety and choices very good. It was well prepared and presented and delicious. The two young evening waiters speak excellent English and are very helpful and attentive. Dining was a very pleasant experience. A wide and extensive buffet exists for breakfast, hot and cold, with cold meats and cheese, yoghurt and cereal, bread and cakes (limited choice of jam), fruit juice, tea, coffee. One word of caution if you eat on the terrace, if you put food on a table and leave it unattended, large birds perched watching nearby will swoop down and start to consume it. They particularly like yoghurt and cereal!

I had a very difficult time getting the front desk to return my emails or requests for information while I was still in the United States. They were no friendlier when I was there in person. They didn't want to exchange currency and were pretty rude about it. They weren't busy so I'm not sure what prompted this...the non manager was more helpful than the manager.

The hotel is above average in many ways and it is certainly very well located, just a short stroll from the Blue Mosque and the Ayasofia. The rooms are large, clean and comfortable but our biggest problem was with the terrible soundproofing. We were given room 319 on the top floor but were kept awake as it is right under the bar/restaurant on the roof terrace. The music stopped at about midnight but then we had the sound of furniture being moved (presumably for breakfast) for the next hour and a half. The noise started again at 6am as they started breakfast! We had had enough and so asked to be moved to a lower floor, which they did without question (they admitted that lots of people complain about the noise), although we still heard noise from the room above. I think the hotel is just very poorly soundproofed, so be sure to take ear plugs! The breakfast was fairly good, although the coffee was some of the worst I have ever tasted (surprising in Turkey!) and the orange juice was not fresh. The shortcomings were more than made up for by the wonderful view out over the Bospheros. Although it was not perfect, the Obelisk was still a good base to explore Istanbul, just make sure you don't get a room on the top floor.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sofia,Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel in tourist center of Istanbul!\u201d", "Author": "BeboAndBebo", "ReviewID": "UR22446280", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel in a tourist center of Istanbul.Everything is near,walking distance I may say.Historical scene are on 5 minute walk.Personal is very friendly.They all speak good english and they are very helpful.The massge,sauna and turkish bath are great.The massuist is a ukraine lady and she is a goddess If you go to Istanbul to see Historical places this is yout hotel!!!

The pictures on the hotel website do not do the place justice. All rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable with 24\" Phillips flat screen tvs. The mattress's are on the firm side, but thats the way we like it. I booked two rooms, a triple and a double, both were standard rooms. The triple ended up being a mini suite with a sofa bed convereted into a 3rd bed. Perfect for our little baby. Our room was very clean. The hotel is less than 3 min walk to the Blue Mosque. 5 mins to Haga Sofia and approx 12 mins to Topkapi palace. Breakfast is served on the terrace floor and it was an excellent selection of food... though not too many cakes / sweets. Last minute.com classified this hotel as 3 star. i would classify it as 4 star. Having spent a lot of time in hotels I would def say this is a 3+ star hotel. List of minor gripes.. The air con did not work in the double room on the 1st night, however a word with reception got this fixed. The water in our room cut out at 2am. Again a quick call to reception resolved this. The lift in the hotel is very small. Not good if you have a big pram. However the hotel is on 3 main floors so using the stairs is possible so long as someone can help with prams / buggies. I went to the resteraunt several times to heat up baby food and they were very kind / helpful.
