But, knowing the Marriott name, and SpringHill Suites being one of their brands, I did have some expectations. Marriott did not disappoint. This SpringHill suite is located in the Rancho Bernardo/Poway, a section of San Diego immediately to the north of San Diego's city limits. We arrived at Carlsbad Airport (a less crowded/busy airport just north of the San Diego area...about a 30 minute drive) via LAX. This location is right next to the freeway, the \"I-15\". But, don't let that scare you. Not only was it very convenient to all area points and \"highways\" (as they are known on the east coast, \"freeways\" as they are known on the west coast, and \"motorways\" as they are known in the UK) north, south, east and west in the area, but it was quiet and very well maintained. In fact, the uppermost floor was being renovated at the time of our stay and we hardly ever heard any noise except for one day, but not until it was mid-day. This location has a very friendly staff at the front desk, and a spectacular breakfast room right off the lobby. Complimentary coffee, tea and hot chocolate is available in the lobby 24 hours a day, along with a variety of fresh local fruits like oranges. Anyone who knows me when I travel knows that I prefer to stay at a place with complimentary breakfast. This place had some of the best variety of breakfast buffets to choose from and it rotated daily so you'd never have a repeat of the prior day's breakfast. They had cereals, buns, pastries, bagels, sausages/bangers, make-your-own waffles, milk, juices, eggs, yogurt...and the list goes on. You'd be hard-pressed not to find something you'd eat for breakfast to start your day right. The location had a small, very modest fitness room, and likewise a very small outdoor pool area. Maid service is daily, but one day someone did \"screw-up\" and failed to clean our room. A call to the front desk resulted in a very humble apology and a query of there was anything that may be needed as a result, like clean linens and the like. Linens were quickly and cheerfully delivered to the room by a maintenance/night housekeeping person who likewise apologized for the inconvenience. The room itself was similar to a large hotel room, but had a king bed, sleeper sofa, desk, refrigerator, microwave oven, sink and bath. One thing I did not like was that the king bed was very close proximity to the exterior window and its air conditioning/heating system. When the AC blew, you could really feel it if you were on the bed. A plexiglass deflector shield to blow the airflow upwards would have been good. Restaurants like Chili's, another Marriott branded hotel, a restaurant and a gas station are all interconnected with the property's parking lot. However, other restaurants, churches (St. Gregory the Great Catholic Church is just a few minutes drive east of the hotel and is a beautiful, modern and unique church building to visit!), grocery stores, malls and the like are all within a very short drive...usually less than 5 minutes. All major attractions, like the San Diego Zoo's Safari Park (Escondido just a short drive to the north), Old Town (a State Historic Park a short drive south), beaches (like Torrey Pines State Park/Beach in the LaJolla section of San Diego...a short drive west) are all within a 20 to 30 minute drive. I would highly recommend this location to anyone visiting the San Diego area due to its high quality, value, convenient location and amenities.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterrey, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGood breakfast, nice service\u201d", "Author": "florenciamartinezs", "ReviewID": "UR120306212", "Content": "Nice hotel, small rooms although they are suites.

I picked this location sight unseen because it was in-between my two destinations and I trust the Marriott/Springhill brand. I was not disappointed. I understand that they're doing some upgrades, and one of the two main elevators was decked out in big cloth drapery to protect the walls. Our second floor room was not yet upgraded, but no big deal. The King-sized bed was comfortable and the furnishings perfectly adequate. Shower pressure was fine, although there's only a single curtain (not double-curtain, no biggie but a style choice). At least the shower rod is curved to provide more room. Toilet and shower are in their own little room apart from the sink, which is good. Didn't use the internet, even though it was free. The mini-fridge kept our drinks cold. And conveniently there's a second little sink in the \"kitchenette\" area. The LG LCD TV worked fine, although I noticed that there's no menu for on-demand programming. No big deal since I was watching the US Open on CBS anyway. The location is what it is. It was convenient for us, but downtown SD is realistically 20-30 minutes away if that's where you're going. There's not much immediately around the hotel except for a Chili's and a Wendy's. Mira Mesa with a big theater, two different supermarkets, and lots of restaurants is exactly one exit south, so that was convenient. Breakfast was typical, although I miss the Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches. I still made my own breakfast sandwich out of a bagel, the provided scrambled eggs, sausage, and hash browns. Yummy. Plenty of cereal, juice, and yogurt (both Yoplait and Activia). I also ate like 3 hard-boiled eggs.

I think Arlington, Texas. In both locations, I had the exact same room layout. In fact, I wake up in the morning shaking, praying to jeeebus that I'm not back in Arlington. The Springhill around the corner from my company's corporate office is the practical and preferred choice for all business travel into San Diego. Thankfully the hotel staff take pride in what they're doing. The desk staff is very friendly, super helpful... even if you've misplaced your room key... three times... during... four days.. Breakfast is served every morning for a few hours starting at 6:30am. It's hotel breakfast, but it's free and gets you going. The housekeeping staff is on point. My room is sparkling every time I come back. The beds are surprisingly comfortable but the sheets aren't enough for me. This is one of those hotels where no comforter is used (and probably for good reason - I read somewhere that hotels only wash those every few months anyway). It just gets cold in here, or really hot... the wall AC/heating unit is a bit testy... you never know what you're going to get come morning. What feels good at midnight may feel like a total 180 when you wake up. On the plus side, even the cheap rooms have a microwave, mini-fridge and kitchen sink meaning this wouldn't be too bad of a spot for an extended stay. As for businesses immediately around the hotel you've got your typical on-the-road-business fare. A Chili's, Wendy's, USA Gasoline and a slightly over priced seafood restaurant called \"The Firegrill\" occupy the same lot. Do yourself a favor and hop in that rental car and just get out of Poway completely. San Diego is a nice town, the last thing you need to do is work all day then hole up right next to I-15 all pissed off about eating a Chili's night after night. The hotel is legit and I guess the moral of the story is that if you're stuck in Poway for work for a week or longer, this is probably your best bet if your company can't score the corporate rate for the Double Tree Golf up the road a bit.

The only comment I will make is the staff should be more knowledgeable about the restaurants in the area. We arrived late and inquired about a place to eat and were told about the fast food places, but not about the restaurants and grocery stores that are south on interstate 15 at the next exit Miramar Rd. After flying cross country you\u2019re not really looking for fast food. johnlh Southfield, MI", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tracy, CA", "Title": "\u201cOkay Place to Sleep but Nothing Else\u201d", "Author": "tripsntraps", "ReviewID": "UR5430320", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for a baseball tournament and found it suitable for teams and business travellers alike. Although we were given a group discount, I would not have been inclined to pay more than the $119 per day if traveling solo. The location was central to pretty much anywhere in San Diego -- as our team played in various locations and took us no more than 30 minutes to get there. We were there 6/28 - 7/3 and found a clean hotel, decent hot breakfast (but after 5 days the menu really gets old) and small but acceptable business \"center.\" The rooms come equipped with a small refrigerator, sink and microwave and an office nook with free high speed internet service, and nice comfortable beds. There is no view to speak of, except for the freeway--if you keep your air conditioner on, the noise doesn't bother you. The downside to the business \"center\" is that only one person at a time can sit at the lone desk and make use of the printer and computer. There's plenty of room and tables in the breakfast area and with the free wireless connection in the lobby --actually gives you a quiet place to work after breakfast hours. As for the pool and the exercise facilities--think small -- no more than 3 or 4 people at a time. Housekeeping was okay --few spoke English but were very courteous nonetheless. There's a convenience store, gas station, fast-food hamburger joint, a Chili's and higher scale seafood restaurant within walking distance. Mercifully, there's a mall with lots of eateries one freeway exit away. The hotel staff was not overly friendly but they did try their best to accommodate our needs--such as luggage storage and other special requests. Overall, an okay place to sleep but not hang around.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201csimple, clean, but definitely not quiet\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5353965", "Content": "the value was great, the room was clean, they were courteous, attentive, and didn't make a big deal about noise.

On labor day weekend we came to the hotel to check in. I will bullet point the list of events that took place. 1. Walked in and noticed there must be 400, 13 year old soccer girls in the lobby and through out the hotel. 2. Checked in, rang us up $40 dollars cheaper then realized he gave us the soccer discount and started over. 3. Went up to our 4 floor requested non- smoking room, walked in and BAM! smelled like the worst casino in Vegas you have ever smelled. 4. Called down, told to come to the front desk cause they dont know how we got placed in a smoking room. 5. A room opened up in the booked hotel. 6. Went up to the third floor...opened the door to find us standing in an occupied room. Laptop, sunglasses, clothes makeup - whole deal! Called down and they told us to STAY in the room, so they could verify there was someone still there!!! What?? no way, we came back down cause we didnt want to stand in someone elses room. 7. Came back to the lobby, this time we were given a bottle of water and a package of Peppridge Farm Milano cookies for our inconvenience. They found another room for us and booked us on the first floor. 8. Went into our new first floor room - HURRAY! Finally!! All was well with the world and we can finally put our backs down 45 minutes later! 9. Fell asleep... LUMPY uneven mattress but that wasnt really the problem. 400 little soccer girls running up and down the halls all night long! Knocking on doors, slamming doors, running upstairs above us. We maybe got 1 hour of sleep. 10. Next morning went down to breakfeast...ask the front desk lobby if soccer girls would be here the whole labor day weekend. He said yes, we asked if there was any way for us to be moved to our requested \"top floor\" he said now and that there are large groups on every floor of the hotel. 11. Suffer thru another night of zero sleep, backs aching and not very happy with the situation we go to check out. 12. Not one person asked us how our stay was, or how we were doing. I asked for a comment card we got a blank stare... finally someone got a comment card and handing a beat up, poorly folded card! When the card was handing the manager didnt say...\"how was your stay\" or \"how can we assist you\" we took the large, told them to have a nice day and left. $160 bucks a night plus tax for a rickity bed on the first floor with 400 giggling 13 year old soccer girls, a not so hot, Hot breakfeast and the soccer family paid 40 bucks less a night than we did!!! Hopefully for others this wont happen... I am good friends with a manager of the Marriott in downtown she told me this hotel is ALWAYS hosted large parties and is known for not being Marriotts best. Take it with a grain of salt but there are at least three other Marriotts within a few miles that do not have this reputation.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Haven, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3555284", "Content": "This is the best hotel my wife and I have ever stayed at. After too many disappointments on previous vacations, we decided to try Springhill Suites, part of the well-respected Marriott family of hotels, and we couldn't have been happier. THe hotel was modern, clean, and the expanded suite-stule rooms are a huge plus when travelling with children, as we visited San Diego with our 3-year old son. The hotel's location is in a good location, right off I-15 in between the San Diego Zoo, The Wild Animal Park, and Legoland. The breakfast buffet is great, offering a great variety of breakfast foods and the hotel even offers baskets of fresh fruit in the lobby, which is a nice touch when coming back from a long day. Springhill Suites was a top-rated suite-hotel in Consumer Reports, and this hotel definitely proves why.

There's a walk-in closet, which I could do w/o in exchange for more \"suite\" space. The two TVs in fact block the walk ways. The bathroom toiletries were lacking (there were only shampoo & soap - no lotion or kleenex). The kitchenette has a microwave, sink, coffee maker & mini fridge - no utensils.
