It was hugely disappointing from beginning to end. The breakfast prices are crazy for what's on offer. And good luck getting coffee breakfast. This staff seems to only be focused and moving quickly when it's time to close down the breakfast buffet. The biggest problem by far is the minibar staff. Though we had turned on our \"do not disturb\" light, the minibar staff walked right in to the room when I was fresh out of the shower. Really. And I am not the first reviewer to note this. So when, in a flood of tears, I went to the desk to deal with this (after being promised a call back from the manager that never came), they offered us free breakfast for the stay and to upgrade our room, and to ensure the \"do not disturb\" light worked in the new room. Interestingly, the upgrade proved to be a downgrade. We got a \"tranquility suite,\" which amounts to a room with no external windows, where despite contacting the desk twice a day every day, they couldn't get the temperature below about 24c/75f, which was warmer than we wanted it. The only windows in the room overlooked a rather cheesy little internal atrium with a \"Japanese garden\" and a direct shot view of the elevator bank, so we could never really open the curtains. And, to top it off, despite a fully functional \"do not disturb\" light that was turned on, a minibar man knocked on the door-- I screamed \"no, don't come in!\" since I was dressing. He walked away only to come back 2 minutes later and unlock the door and start to come in without knocking. I raised this again with the desk (it was the day before checkout) and they promised it would be taken care of. I checked out to not even as much as an apology. Finally, even if this place were not a management disaster, where you can be assured of being walked in on, you don't want to stay here if you are planning to get around istanbul by taxi to see the sights. Traffic in nisantasi, especially up the street where the hotel is, is horrible. More than 1/2 of the time of our trip from the airport was the last kilometer to the hotel. And one afternoon when I wanted to go to the bazaar, hotel staff simply could not get me a taxi. We tried for nearly 20 minutes and finally gave up. Coming back from a program one evening, 8 taxis turned us diwn when we told them where we were going, saying the traffic is way too much.

They were supposed to call us when the room was ready. We never received a call. The rooms are nice but the bathroom felt a little odd. The bathroom door which is a large glass got stuck. The shower setup seems really useless. The hotel is centrally located if you are into brand shopping. You will not have Istanbul experience here. It is more like Union Square in San Francisco. It was fun for the New Years because the city has a big street party and that's what we wanted to see. The street party is only a block away from the hotel. There is no Wi-fi in the room.

We planned to spend our entire visit in hotels in Sultanahmet but realized after two days there that we needed a change of scenery. So we changed our reservation for our last three nights in the city to the Sofa, and we're so glad we did. A disclaimer: we were at the Sofa during the week during the off-season, so the usually quite high prices were much more reasonable. We got a special offer via the hotel's website which gave us three nights for the price of two with free breakfast (NOTE: the hotel does not automatically offer free breakfast!). So, check out the hotel's website for reservations! We came to the Sofa after spending our first two days in Istanbul at a family-run, very homey place. We expected that the Sofa, as a more modern boutique hotel, would be less warm feeling, not quite as hospitable. But happily we were wrong! Turkish hospitality is alive and well here. The hotel itself, it goes without saying, is pretty gorgeous. Very chic decor; we almost didn't feel cool enough to be there:) Our room was fantastic, with a rain shower, super comfy beds, and there's anything one could ever want in the bathroom: slippers, bathrobes, Molton Brown bath products (Lots of snacks available in the room as well but careful, they're not free and majorly overpriced in euros). The TV thankfully has a few English channels as well---not something common in Turkey. The concierge downstairs and the attendants in the lobby are always at the ready to help make a dinner reservation, catch you a cab, or answer general questions. Breakfast was delicious---full Turkish style (it just goes on and on), with some Western touches like bacon and scrambled eggs and potatoes. The dining room of course feels like a super cool mod lounge. Location-wise, this is a hotel for a visitor who has already been to the Old City (not totally inconvenient----the tram will get you there straightaway--but it will take some time). It's a convenient 10-15 minute walk to Taksim Square and the Istikal Caddesi and there's a metro stop reasonably close by which we found useful after a long day of trekking all over Istanbul. The Nisantasi district is a great place to go shopping and a good place to find more modern cuisine (after seven days of Turkish food, though it was delicious, we wanted a bit of a change; would highly recommend the House Cafe, a few blocks from the Sofa). We liked the fact that the hotel felt like it was part of modern Istanbul. All in all, highly recommend the Sofa (for those who can afford it).

Best of all however is the open air rooftop event location the hotel operates for weddings and other functions. One night of our stay a wedding party went on until well after 1.30am with hammering bass sounds that made sleeping entirely impossible until the night manager found a windowless room for us somewhere on a lower floor. Without doubt the rooftop venue is a significant revenue generator for the hotel so on balance they probably do not care about an occasional complaint. In my mind it is entirely ruthless to hold such events while having guests on the top floors of the hotel.

It is an entirely different feel from either the Taksim Square area or the Bosphorous area and I'm glad we got to stay here for that reason, in addition to the hotel being pretty cool. At some points they let their desire to become a nightclub get the better of them, at the expense of their hotel guests. They closed their \"hip\" hotel restaurant, Longtable, on a Saturday night to all hotel guests so they could have some dramatic function with red carpets and a bunch of nonsense. That is really ridiculous, but the place is overpriced anyway, so I guess we were better off. But still, it just goes to show where their priorities are. We had one of the somewhat maligned \"tranquility\" rooms that have no windows, just a fake one, with a backlit curtain instead. Personally, I didn't mind it since it made the room really dark and it was really quiet which isn't always the case in other rooms in this hotel. However, my partner thought it was sort of creepy and claustrophobic to be locked inside a box like that. It is a very well decorated box though, you can't deny that. I think I would recommend this hotel be combined with another in a more accessible part of the city to the tourist sites if that is what you are there to see.

The music/bass was beyond loud and shook parts of the room. Insane! The music turned down at 12 but still if that happened more than once during someone's visit it could be an issue. The hotel uses the rooftop for parties/rentals so who knows how often this happens. Great attention to detail in rooms and bath.

We have stayed at many 5 star Istanbul hotels and wanted to be in the center of the city. The rooms are very nice and the hip quotient is high. The staff is also very eager to please. The rooms were spacious and the beds quite comfortable. Those are the positives. If you are looking for a good night's sleep, you have to choose the Tranquility Rooms. Unfortunately, as I am claustrophobic, I could not go with this options as the rooms face a small shaftway looking at other interior Tranquility Rooms. They say that the view is of a Japanese Garden; however, you have to look down the shaftway to see the garden. As the room does not get much natural light, it is very dark. The rooms facing the front of the hotel face a huge electronic billboard on the facade of the shopping mall across the street. We were also unfortunate enough to deal with a commercial shoot on our first night which lasted until 4:00 a.m.. 200 extras, screaming directors and spotlights. We moved to a room in the back of the hotel. The room was smaller and I was a bit concerned as there was construction in the back. I was assured that construction was during regular hours. Unfortunately, the construction started 6:00 am. and on that night continued until 2:00 a.m. The staff was sympathetic and nice enough to upgrade us to a suite; however, the extra space did not make up for the noise again on busy Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel has a very popular nightclub , so as the evening progresses, the sound of honking horns is non-stop as the cars clog the small road. All in all, we did not get the rest we were looking for and would have changed hotels had we not prepaid through a third party vendor. I would recommend that the hotel install triple-paned windows to block out the noise and somehow try to deal with the cars blocking the road for those patrons coming into/leaving the nightclub. They should also provide earplugs in the room. If you are not a light sleeper or can cope with the Tranquility rooms, I would say that you would be okay with the hotel. Also, tbe aware that here is no wireless Internet in the rooms. The cost of ethernet service is also quite high.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exton, PA", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Five Days\u201d", "Author": "LPSExton_PA", "ReviewID": "UR21896239", "Content": "Just got back from five fabulous nights at the Sofa. It was everything we look for in a \"high design\" hotel. Room was large and well-equipped with Flat Screen TV, etc. Bathroom was as good as it gets with a separate rain shower room beside the bathtub. Definitely met our criteria for the \"hip quotient\". The Nistansi area- where the hotel sits on a very busy street- was a lot like the high fashion areas of Barcelona full of great shopping and trendy restaurants. Unlike Barcelona,we always felt safe no matter what time of day or night we walked around. Common area lobby was very comfortable and a great place to have breakfast (full buffet), afternoon coffee and evening drinks. Longtable- the hotel's restaurant and nightclub- was one of the highlights of our trip. All the \"pretty people\" of Istanbul gathered to eat, drink and party. The food was great and the scene was just amazing. Surprised by how well-priced our Saturday Soiree was considering the food and atmosphere. Without a doubt, best thing about the Sofa was the staff and their level of service. We felt more like welcomed visiting cousins of a hip-and-wealthy family than hotel guests. They went out of their way to make everything perfect- and always with a smile. Even though we had booked a \"bargain\" rate over the Web, we were treated like \"high rollers\". Questions and pleas for advice on restaurants, shopping, tours, etc were always answered with great suggestions. Everyone went out of their way to please and serve us- not because they had to, but because they wanted to. On our second night, the couple next store stayed up all night being drunk, loud and obnoxious. When we mentioned it the next morning, the staff was very upset. When we came back from shopping that day, we had already been upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. You don't see this very often in the world of high design hotels- and we have stayed in many over the last few years. We just loved Istanbul and plan to go back next year.

It is modern, clean and has fantastic amenities. The toiletries were reason enough to stay. The bed was comfy, with a selection of pillows. The room had a flat screen tv, mini bar, safe, robes, slippers, tasty chocolates, and a very cool bathroom. There was a large shower with a giant rain-type shower head, and in the same glassed in space, was a separate tub with luxurious bath salts available. There was a fantastic selection of shampoos and soaps. My room was facing the City Mall on the main street. The pros were a view of people and a small balcony. The cons were noise (which didn't really bother me because I'm from New York) and a large ever-flashing video screen that strobed all night long, even through the blackout curtains. But this room is the best choice after hearing about my co-worker's rooms. One friend had a room on the 2nd floor right over the very popular restaurant and bar. The thumping of bass all night long, caused him to change rooms in the middle of the night. Other rooms had only an interior zen garden view. No outside light, no idea if it was sunny or raining. Ask for a street view on a high floor. The staff was very accommodating-except in the breakfast room. But I found this to be a common problem in all restaurants in Istanbul. There really isn't a concept of checking on guests to see if they need anything else. More often than not, I had to carry my coffee cup to them for a refill. The buffet breakfast was not included in my case. And it was outrageously expensive. 43 YTL (which is about $32.00). And not worth it. They had a big variety of olives and cheeses, but the vat of scrambled eggs was grossly runny. So I only found about $5.00 worth of food to my liking. One day I ordered room service (for considerably less money) and asked for my eggs to be scrambled-well done. They were like a bowl of egg soup. I sent them back and suggested they cook them till they were brown. I got in return, slightly less runny eggs. So breakfast is a definite con. There was a lovely wellness and detox center downstairs that I didn't have a chance to use. But it looked really nice. The restaurant/bar was pretty cool. It had super fun decor, and each table was of a unique style. I recommend the kebab pizza. The specialty drink menu is only recommended if you have an unlimited expense account. The entertainment in the bar is fun. Out comes a cool looking rasta dude, who proceeds to sing every cheesy Vegas song every composed. He walks around and sits at ones table while he sings. It's a good time. Very nice management as well. This seems to be a popular spot with the locals. Very young and trendy. Remember, don't get a room above it. If I needed to be in Istanbul, and I didn't want to be in The Old City (which I can't imagine), I would stay there again. It's about a $16.00 cab ride into the Old City.

When we checked in, we were really impressed by the well designed lobby/bar area, and the helpful check-in staff, led by Arda. Our rooms were comfortable and clean, with a gigantic bathroom and flat-panel LCD TV. There were lots of construction noises at night, but that was not the Hotel's fault. In addition, the hotel had a beautiful Spa/Fitness area with a small relaxing pool meant for sense deprivation I think. In addition there was a traditional Turkish Bath and Sauna. The concierge team, lead by Deniz, Alican, and Murcan, really helped us out and pointed us in the right direction daily, from walking routes to detailed guides of local metro. The metro is very well organized, but talk with the concierge team because they can give you some good tips, especially about the boat routes which you'll need if you want to visit Prince's Islands. The hotel is about a 20 min walk to Taxim Square, and 20 min walk from Dolmabache Palace, so be prepared to exercise. However, we always felt energized because of the great breakfast spread. The wait staff, including Izlem and Ahmet, were friendly and attentive. A few issues was that the restaurant that the hotel recommended, Kosibasi, really took advantage of my wife and I being tourists, and ripped us off for dinner. We spoke to other tourists and they had the same thing happen to them. We were charged 10 Liras for a plate of tomatoes that we thought was on the house (and according to other friendly Turkey locals, they should have been), bread that was put on our plate that we were charged 5 Liras a piece for. Very unprofessional. Also, at checkout, we were charged incidentals that we didn't pay for. But the hotel staff resolved that quickly, though it was really surprising since my wife and I make a point to count every piece of food in the bar fridge.

We walked everywhere and used the public transportation, so there was no need for a taxi at all. The area the hotel is in is hip, chic, trendy and super safe. I would recommend this area for people who don't want to be stuck in the tourist trap areas of Taksim and Sulmahanet. This is literally a 20 min walk to Taksim which is what we did every day. There are some fantastic restaurants and cafes nearby the hotel (Tip: Avoid Koshibashi rest, they overcharge when they see tourists!!). Our breakfast buffet every morning at the hotel consisted of fresh juices, pastries, breads, cheeses, olives, yogurts, eggs, bacon and hot vegetable medley! It was absolutely delicious. Also, we highly recommened chilling at their bar area for one night, it is soo relaxing and truly a hidden find. As a guest, you also have access to their Spa services which include the Turkish bath ( I used to go on my own for free, if you ask for someone to do a massage you have to pay), fitness center and relaxing pool (tip:after a long day sightseeing, go there to relax-its totally worth it!). Finally, having free wireless service in the lounge definitely was a big plus as brought our laptop (they charge you if you use it in the room so just go to the lobby).

OMG! I just paid it so that i could get away from her and upstairs to my room. Another employee followed me up to my room and apologized for her colleague, but by then, I just wanted to leave the hotel. I was looking forward to staying there but having been abused about a situation that was clearly their problem, the trust was gone. I was traveling alone and wanted to feel as though the hotel had my back a little bit. Not the case. Then, because it was late and i was exhausted, I ordered dinner. Average taste for exhorbitant cost. And again, so so service. The next day, I went to the W Istanbul. They upgraded me to an amazing room (the one at the Sofa is nice, but very plain). So the long and the short is that the hotel is very attractive and well located but the staff are horrible.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piraeus, Greece", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "gelPiraeus_Greece", "ReviewID": "UR14207855", "Content": "I stayed there in late February 2008. The hotel is a great, great boutique hotel in the heart of the most fashionable shopping district of Istanbul, Nisantasi. The check in was a pleasant and warm experience, albeit somewhat slow. The staff was extremely friendly, attentive and polite throughout our stay. The room was great, spacious (mind you this was the regular room, not some suite), and had all the goodies one would expect from a luxury hotel. Somebody had handwritten my name in the notepad next to the bed prior to my arrival there, certainly a nice touch. The price was reasonable, I booked through an internet site, and it cost Euro 162.- including all taxes, but without breakfast. The price for evertything for sale in the hotel was quite expensive. Breakfast was Euro 24 per person, and somebody charged us that, even though we only had one cup of coffee. We picked this up when paying the bill, and it was refunded swiftly. Overall, great place to relax in Istanbul, especially if you want to avoid being near all the tourist attractions for a change.", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely Recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Oroppas", "ReviewID": "UR12490047", "Content": "Darling little hotel with excellent service in a swanky neighborhood.
