First, the plus points. Having done a lot of research, I think we got a really good price for such a centrally located property. And it is in a great location for Paris. St. Germain is a lovely, buzzy area with a plethora of wonderful places to eat. Rue Dauphine houses some wonderful little boutiques, a specialist chocolate shop, some wonderful shops for leather bags, art galleries and studios. It is a stones throw from the Seine and we only used the metro to get from the Gare du Nord and back - because pretty much everything was in walking distance. So overall, great. But there were a couple of things that could be improved: 1) the guy on reception when we arrived was not exactly friendly!! When you've been travelling all day, it makes a BIG difference to get a smile and a warm welcome. Sadly, this was lacking and will be one of the key things we remember. The other people on reception (particularly the gentleman on the day we left) were much better! Yes, there can be cultural differences but staff need to be trained to the expectations of visiting guests! 2) We had requested a courtyard room and were given a street facing room (with no explanation). We were so tired when we arrived we couldn't be bothered to go back down to Reception (and face Mr. Grumpy)....this was a mistake as it was pretty noisy on both Friday and Saturday nights. I wear ear plugs and could still hear some noise from revellers - this was partly due to the fact that on the Friday night, the aircon didn't seem to be working so we had to sleep with a window open. It had been 21C in Paris that day (yes in March!) and it was very hot in the room. This was sorted for us on the Saturday. 3) We didn't have breakfast there (we were on a room-only basis) but personally when in Paris I prefer to grab a croissant, baguette, coffee and OJ from one of the local cafes which is much more atmospheric and cheaper too... But, we've given it 4 stars because the room itself was lovely, atmospheric and the hotel is in a fab location (a quieter side street would be even more preferable). Making sure that every guest is greeted with warmth would go a long way to making this hotel even better and make guests feel that reception are more approachable. Thanks for reading!

We arrived very early in the morning and they said that they had one room ready for us. It was the \u201csuperior\u201d double. The room was on the top floor and very tiny with a tiny double bed. The shower was over the bath and had no pole to support the shower, therefore you had to hold the shower hose in your hand. Very difficult to wash long hair! There was also no shower screen or curtain, so water sprayed everywhere. We set out exploring for the day and returned in the afternoon to organise our children\u2019s room. Their room was much, much larger with a great bathroom and proper shower over the bath. I spoke to the man on reception who told me we were definitely in a superior double and that all the rooms were different. We spent the first night in that tiny room. After another difficult shower the next morning, where by husband actually slipped in the bath as there was no mat or not slip surface, we headed back to reception where they said they now had another room free on a lower floor. We had a look at that and it was so much better, larger and again with a proper bathroom. We immediately moved to that room. I get the feeling that they try to fob off their worst room on people arriving early and desperate for a room to freshen up in so beware. Once the room was sorted, the rest of the stay was wonderful. The staff manning the front desk and the tiny bar were lovely. When we complemented them on a wine we were enjoying in the bar, two bottles appeared in our room with compliments. Nothing was ever too much trouble. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel as we preferred to go out and try the local brasseries. The location of the hotel cannot be beaten. Within two minutes you are at a variety of restaurants, brasseries and cafes, also at the Seine at Pont Neuf. Five minutes walk has you at St Michel Metro and RER station, or fifteen minutes will have you at the Louvre or d\u2019Orsay. The only reason we are not staying there for our next trip is that there are so many hotels in Paris, it is nice to try something different in a different area.

The hotel is in a good location and is centrally located. However, I cannot recommend the hotel because of how we were treated upon our arrival. We arrived early on the morning of Sept 17 and were told that check-in was at noon, which was fine by us. After walking around for a bit we returned to the hotel and were given the keys to a small room in the attic with a double bed. I had paid in advance for a larger room with a king sized bed. The hotel clerk (Michael) insisted that all of the rooms and beds in the hotel were the same size and basically \"take it or leave it\". He also told me that breakfast was not included in my rate. I had it in writing on my confirmation that breakfast was included and that we had a larger room with a king sized bed. Having now been awake for over 24 hours and being exhausted, i gave up and went to my room. This room was so small that I could not get all of my luggage and my wife and I in the room at the same time. I went downstairs again to complain when I happened to walk past a room on the first floor (#11) whose door happened to be open with two maids finishing their cleaning. I asked them if this was a junior suite and they informed me this was a normal room with a king sized bed. I went down to the front desk and calmly told Michael that I saw room #11 and that it had a king sized bed. Knowing that I caught him in a lie, he started screaming at me and told me I should not be \"snooping around the hotel.\" I then barked back and demanded to speak with the hotel manager. He refused and said the manager was out of the country. I told him I was not leaving the lobby until he gave us a different room. After a few minutes, he ended up giving me room #11 but still insisted that breakfast was not included. Having at least now a room that I could fit my luggage in, I went upstairs to settle in. The next morning I came down to complain about breakfast not being included. The manager told me it was included and tried to pretend like nothing had happened.

The business area is located in a dingy room in the basement with a dinosaur PC so we ended up using the free wifi for our phone. St. Germain is an charming area with lots of restaurants and unique stores. It is not that close to other attractions though but it's near the metro, which we found to be a bit complex.

We are a 40-ish couple visiting Paris for the first time. This is a small hotel on a cute street in the St. Germain area. The positives are the location--Rue Dauphine becomes Pont Neuf and is only a block or two from Ile de la Cite, the Seine river and MANY, many outdoor cafes and restaurants. If you are looking for an area with a lively nightlife, this is your spot! The desk clerks were always helpful, but reserved. The hotel itself is well-mainted, but tiny. After a great deal of research, I was prepared for small rooms. They were tiny. Tiny lobby, tiny elevator, tiny rooms, tiny bathroom. We booked a Superior room with the requested two twin beds pushed together to make a king (we are used to sleeping on a king bed and many of the double beds in Europe are very small). This was not the room they initially tried to give us. We refused the initial room, as it was not what we had booked. The superior room was very claustrophobic. I was constantly bumping knees and elbows trying to move around the room or get ready in the bathroom. Our room faced Rue Dauphine- Paris stays up VERY late at night. Even when we would return to our room at 12 or 1am, we were kept awake most of the night by the partying on the street. Then, once that would die down, the garbage trucks and delivery trucks would move in early in the a.m. It was VERY noisy and we are generally pretty tolerant.

Thank you once again Ludovic, as per my email you are a true ambassador for La Dauphine and I am happy to recommend your hotel to anyone. So to the facts. This is charming, small hotel in the heart of St Germain. On arrival you notice the beautifully decorated breakfast room and a sweet little bar; we didn't use either so I can't comment on prices. Our room was small, as all such hotels in Paris are, and traditionally decorated with Toile de Joue and a very comfy bed. Not much hanging space but enough for a few days stay. The bathroom was compact and modern, as per the website photos. I have to praise the cleaning staff, they seemed to work very hard. Reception team spoke perfect English if that's a concern for you and did a mini 'security check' one day when I appeared mid-morning asking for our room key. Far from being annoyed, I appreciated this. I originally picked La Dauphine because of its location. I wanted to enjoy the buzz and vibrancy of this part of the city in the middle of summer, particularly at night. As we usually come to Paris in winter, we tend not to spend too much time outdoors after dark so I was looking forward to the atmosphere of the cobbled lanes and drinks al fresco. Didn't quite happen like that as it rained but the potential was definitely there! You truly could not be more central with a multitude of cafes, restaurants and bars right on the hotel doorstep (again handy in the pouring rain). You are also right on the edge of the Seine with Notre Dame, Jardins de Luxembourg etc only a 10 minute walk away. I absolutely recommend this hotel - it is prettily Parisienne, clean and comfortable, in a fantastic location (without any noise problems) and, as I've since discovered, has Management who are professional and courteous.

The back room was very quiet, but it's window looked out into a sort of well of windows, the only bright spots in a dirty, crumbling wall. Maybe that explained the smell in that room. We arrived at 4 pm and housekeeping was still cleaning our rooms. There seemed to be some trouble between the manager and the housekeeping staff.

By the way, I have been to Paris many times before. The hotels where I usually stay were booked full, and so were many others, and in the end I wound up at the Dauphine St. Germain. There is definitely nothing wrong with the hotel, but I don\u2019t quite understand the rave reviews on Tripadvisor either. Maybe I was unlucky. I paid 250 euros a night, which I find very expensive for what is really a rather average hotel. I had room 36, and when entering I wound up in a narrow corridor (on the right hand side of which was the bathroom (spacious, marble), than an other small corridor to the left, at the end of which was the room. View on an inner courtyard, two single beds shoved together, rather smallish. Neat, and everything well taken care off, air conditioning functioning fine. But when I returned later at night, after having had dinner, the televison did\u2019 nt. The antenna appeared to be unplugged and I couldn\u2019t find anything to plug it in. No, I really couldn\u2019t. There were all sort of lose wires hanging behind the chest. The door of my closet didn\u2019t close. The hangers were of the wrong kind, you know, the irritating kind. The next morning the elevator didn\u2019t work. Service is okay, personnel is friendly. You have to ring a bell most of the time to enter. I didn\u2019t take breakfast, and not many people did, was my impression. After having been overcharged for my hotel, I didn\u2019t feel like being overcharged for breakfast as well. My televison was repaired the next day. It is my impression that in hotels like this you pay a 100 extra for location and the marble in your bathroom. Because location is the best thing of the hotel of course, situated as it is on Rue Dauphine, at 200 meters from the Seine, with Pont Neuf at the end of the street. You are right in the middle of Saint Germain. Rue Dauphine is a sidestreet from Rue Saint-Andr\u00e9 des Arts. Nearest metrostation is probably Saint Michel (on line 4, Porte Clignancourt-Porte d\u2019Orleans), but Odeon is not much further (also line 4, next station after Saint Michel, and number 10, Boulogne-Saint Cloud). The only problem (if you wish to consider it so) is that you will probably always have to change metro\u2019s if you really want to go anywhere. On the other hand, you could go to Orsay, Louvre and Notre Dame by foot, although the first two would be a stiff walk. The area around the hotel is lively, and there are many restaurants and caf\u00e9s, but it is also very expensive and very touristy, if you compare it to the Marais for instance. I paid (to just give an example) 11 euros for a beer (Belgian, white beer, I admit), and 6 for a glass of white wine. Being a somewhat elderly man already I just wondered about one thing. Many, many years ago, as a student, I wound up at a very simple hotel in Rue Dauphine too. It was dirt cheap than, and not just dirt cheap, if you understand what I mean. I kept asking myself: was this the same hotel, but refurbished? No, the personnel was to young to ask. So I didn\u2019t. That was somewhere around 1975. I think I paid 50 francs or so. 50 francs?

I only have 2 minor complaints- neither a deal breaker. The safe is a door in the wall about the size of a brick- large enough for passports and a money belt, operated by a key. It should be replaced with the standard room safe bolted into furniture or closets with a digital combination and large enough for an ipad. Our room faced rue Dauphine. The windows are single glazed so we had a lot of noise from the Irish bar a few doors down at night. Double glazed windows would solve that problem. I just used ear plugs. Also the bathroom window needs to be frosted glass so the people who live in the apartments directly across can't see in. Our towel warmer did not work well.

There are a lot of great boutiques and eateries in this neighbourhood and not so heavily visited by tourists. 4) We took a river cruise on the Seine for only 13 Euros and well worth it (takes you close to the Eiffel Tower so it is nice to see the sights from a different perspective). 5) Access cannot be beat - the Odeon metro is a five minute walk from the hotel, only one line (so you don't need to transfer lines) to the Gare du Nord, takes about 15 minutes. Great if you are catching the Eurostar. Shuttles can be arranged as well to the airport but from Orly Airport, one can easily take the shuttle bus close to the Bievenue Montparnasse metro station, and then it is only about 4 stops away to Odeon (the metro stop for the hotel).

Be it a late cafe au lait, directions to a local store , an ice bucket for our night cap or the much appreciated complementary coupe de champagne with our lunch at the Train Blue, ending with a stress free transfer to CDG on departure, nothing was too much trouble! Our room, while on the small side as is normal in Paris, was very , very, comfortable and we loved the luxury of the textured wall covering (room 14). The bathroom was everything one would desire with a great pressure shower, lots of towels replaced every day, good quality bathroom gels and body lotions etc. and excellent care of our room during our visit. My sister especially liked the boot buffer just at the end of reception! This is our third visit to Paris in early December and we choose a different arrondissment each time. Having stayed in St. Germain we think it would be hard to beat this location and will return again. The beautiful church of St. Germain, people watching while enjoying an expresso or vin rouge at one of the many bars . Walking around the amazing renovated maison Ralph Lauren on Boulevard St. Germain, having an epic meal at L'Epi Dupin and spending hours browsing and buying at Le Bon Marche , the great fun talking in very poor French to the locals, a smile and some good manners go a long way in Paris. And then to return to a cocoon of warmth and security as we did with the Dauphine made our short visit wonderful. We should not forget the great italian restaurant a few doors down from the Dauphine , I think it was called the Mazzarin. When we arrived at 10.30pm on our first night, they fed us and made us laugh, , though that could have been the relief of getting to Paris in the worst weather conditions we have ever known or maybe the very good vin rouge maison! We loved the family atmosphere and returned on our last night for the best Neapolitan pizza and affogato we have ever had .

I don't generally complain about street noise or small rooms and elevators, because that's to be expected in this neighborhood. When you stay here, you're paying for the location. This hotel has the typical Paris charm and is obviously in a fabulously convenient location, but that's all it has going for it. The rooms are teen tiny even for the neighborhood, and there is no storage space for your luggage or clothes. The \"closet\" was an armoire with a total of 6 broken hangers that weren't high enough to hang a pair of men's pants, let alone my wife's coat. There was no room to place our two suitcases without tripping over them. The bathroom was a contortionist's wet dream. And we had one of the better rooms facing the street. The building is about large enough for 3 decent rooms per floor, but it was chopped up to turn it into 5, so half of the floor space is hallways, and all the rooms are tiny. When I checked in, the desk clerk gave me an option of two rooms, this one and one in the back. After entering the door to the second room, I had to walk along 2 long hallways in the dark to get to the room proper. The room itself overlooked a dingy stairwell with little light. No thank you. 2 of the 5 rooms on each floor are like this, so you're rolling the dice when you book a room here. Hint: The floor plan displayed on the wall reveals that all the rooms are essentially the same size, so there's no point in booking anything but the lowest price available. I will say that all the staff members are extremely polite and helpful, some of the best I've encountered in Paris, and they did make our stay comfortable. If you're a single traveler and you're lucky and you get a street facing room, you might have a good time. If you're traveling as a couple, just forget it.

Firstly the situation of the Hotel is perfect from reaching it via the RER from CDG, couldn't be more simple, no changing lines, a direct route and short walk. Its position in the Latin Quarter is great; slightly away from the more brash tourist area which is across the road from the St Michel Fountain, with it's tourist tat shops and multi-ethnic restaurants. This area reminded me of the 'Drains' in Sorrento with a mixture of a package holiday resort. The Dauphine however, is surrounded by more 'French' feeling bars and restaurants and yet it is a quiet and relaxing oasis.We were kindly upgraded to a superior room after a simple exchange of emails, many thanks. Our room was no smaller than many typical English B&B's, but well furnished and appointed. I like small and quaint and that's what we got so a happy bunny! As has been said previously, the staff were all great, although we had most to do with Guy of whom we cannot speak highly enough. Extremely helpful, friendly and attentive, he should give lessons to people in how to give good customer service. Because of the 'French' disease (strikes) Guy checked our flight and ensured that our taxi would arrive, as he advised against taking the RER on 'the day of action', great service. Shame he's leaving for Bordeaux but maybe we should check out that City! We took breakfast every morning up the street in Le Buci, \u20ac8.50 good value. We ate at Vins et Terroirs, on Rue St Andre des Arts, unassuming but passable food; Le Christine on Rue Christine, more expensive but better quality and one other which I can't remember so enough said!

I stayed here for seven nights by myself in early February. While I booked a standard double, I was upgraded to a superior double (room 14) at no extra charge. The room was far from the smallest I've stayed in in Paris (though not spacious) and the marble bathroom was truly luxurious for this class of hotel. Good toiletries and towels were provided, as was a hairdryer and heated towel bars. There was a bath and shower, and it was scrupulously clean. Everything worked. the room itself was elegantly furnished with cheerful yellow fabric on the walls, a large and comfortable bed, a good desk, two chairs and a wardrobe. Free wireless worked well all the time I was there -- not to be taken for granted in many parisien hotels. The room itself was quite dark because it overlooked an inner courtyard, but I expect that would be a blessing in the summer when tourist crowds make the streets noisy. This room was very quiet and I didn't even hear any neighbours through the walls, which usually annoys me in hotels in this price range. the breakfast is expensive at 16 euros, but it is better than most hotel breakfasts with good juice, yoghurts, boiled eggs, meats, cheese, bread, croissants, cereals and pastries. Excellent coffee, chocolate and tea were available. There is also a hot selection that didn't vary for the week I stayed there: sausages, spinach, baked beans and fritatta. If you're saving money, there are many restaurants and cafes in the area that will provide a petit dejeuner francais (continental) at 6.50 and a petit dejeuner americain ou anglais (with meat and eggs) at 8.50, but I enjoyed the cheerful breakfast room and friendly attendants. Moreover, it is very convenient to breakfast in the hotel. The location can't be beat. It's right on the RER B line, so you can take the train directly from CDG without worrying about transferring with luggage. The hotel is a 5-10 minute walk from the station (and St. Michel, Notre Dame etc). The staff tolerated my attempts to speak French, and effortlessly switched to English when necessary. They went out of their way to make my stay very comfortable and enjoyable. There are many excellent restaurants and cafes in the area. I highly recommend \"La rotisserie en face\" on rue christine. It's a bit expensive, but has wonderful French food including excellent guinea fowl in pastry (Moroccan?), and really good rotisserie chicken. \"La Bergamote\", very nearby, was also excellent -- much cheaper than \"la rotisserie\" and quite creative. Dauphine St Germain is a very French hotel, by which I mean that if you like big rooms with lots of light, coffeemakers, and so on, you should pay more and stay in tourist hotels that cater to North Americans.

They did change the room for us the following day, but unfortunately the second room was only slightly more comfortable and quite dingy/old/run-down. I realize pickings in Paris are slim for a well-sized room at a good price--but for $230Euros, I expected a bit more.", "Date": "September 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSmall but comfortable\u201d", "Author": "annettedg", "ReviewID": "UR19772961", "Content": "We stayed at the Dauphine St. Germain hotel with our teenage daughter at the beginning of August 08.

It was clean, however, and the staff was very accommodating and friendly. The price was reasonable for Paris and for this fantastic location. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family.

Our first time in this hotel but we are very familiar with the area. We stayed in Room 66 \u2013 on the sixth floor. The room was small \u2013 what else!, but had a hallway that separated the bedroom from the bathroom. This felt odd at first, but it provided the sense that the room was actually bigger than it was. The bathroom was tiny as well with a stand-up shower and no bath. Only one person could use the bathroom at a time. The nicest feature about the room was the view from the small hallway window where you could see the Eiffel Tower and the gold dome of the Invalides. At night, the view was especially good with the EF in lights. The room was cleaned daily with fresh linens and towels. Our hotel deal included breakfast, which was more than adequate to get your day going. Mostly cold buffet foods \u2013 yogurt, fresh and canned fruit salads, croissant/breads, cheese and meats, OJ, and hard boiled eggs. Noticed some hot food but couldn\u2019t really tell you what they had. And of course really good coffee! Served in a small but airy room. One day we asked for breakfast in our room which they were quick to bring up, for a small charge. As previously mentioned, the lift is small but certainly adequate for one person with luggage, or two to three people without. All Paris hotel lifts are small and this one is no different. During our stay the lift broke twice and it took nearly a day to repair. Had to walk the six flights up one time. Hey, things break. Wonderful staff \u2013 front desk, breakfast room, housekeepers.

The room was excellent, clean, warm and inviting and parisian. I did not want to wake up where I could have been in any hotel room anywhere in the world - I wanted to know I was in paris!! The bathroom was small and the bath ok for small folk, but it was all spotlessly clean with soft fluffy towels. The lift is small but who spends long in there anyway. The staff were polite, helpful and there if you needed them - not pushy / arrogant or missing! The best thing about this hotel is its location. Arriving from the airport its easy to get to on RER B and then a 400m walk. You are very close to the Seine and an easy stroll to the Louvre / Notre Dame / Bvd. St Germain.

Rooms seem to be average for this class of hotel in Paris. Good location, easy access to Metro, lots of caf\u00e9s and restaurants nearby. The concierges were always helpful\u2014with directions, with restaurant recommendations, etc. I stayed here for two nights on business, so my company made the reservations. The corporate price we paid is lower than what\u2019s advertised on the website, and breakfast was included. I arrived early, as usual for flights from the U.S. and my room wasn\u2019t ready. The room I had requested was the 6th floor suite (#61), but check out isn\u2019t until noon and the previous guests hadn\u2019t checked out yet. However, the concierge gave me another room (#31) to rest in until my reserved room was ready. #31 was small, but quite functional and would have been fine\u2014although it would have been a tight fit with my large bags. The 6th floor suite was quite pretty, with wood floors (bring slippers) and a small separate dressing area with a wardrobe and day bed. The bedroom itself was relatively large. The d\u00e9cor included warm yellow fabric on the walls, which turned the room a bright gold on sunny mornings as the small windows faced east. The view out the east windows was of Paris rooftops (a favorite view of mine), including the top of Notre Dame and the Pantheon. One of the nice things about the suite is that there was a real queen sized bed\u2014not two twin beds pushed together (as in #31). The bed wasn\u2019t plush, but was comfortable enough. They really need to get new pillows, though. The heat worked well when I was there in mid-December. I didn\u2019t try the air conditioning, but since this is an attic room, it might get quite warm during a heat wave in the summer. The bathrooms (in both the single room and the suite) are well lit and completely updated. The bathroom in the suite was large and bright. The entire hotel seemed very clean and well maintained. Not shabby. Breakfast downstairs is adequate, and could also be had in the room. Overall, this hotel is as I said at the beginning\u2014a solid 3-star hotel. In Paris, this means that the rooms are smallish (by American standards) and clean, the amenities are functional and not luxurious (no high-end toiletries, no robe), but everything you need is here and the front desk staff will do its best to see that you have a pleasant stay.
