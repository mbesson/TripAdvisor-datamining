The negative thing is its position, outside of the city. For us it was ok because we had a car, but it was really difficult to find. The staff was helpful, we called from the city and they gave us instrctions on how to arrive. The breakfast was prety poor, they only had some pastry, bread butter/jam. For us it was ok, we really liked it because it was confortable and clean.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Lakes, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery bad experience\u201d", "Author": "Java K", "ReviewID": "UR121672255", "Content": "Frankly, it was a quite disappointing experience when I stayed at the hotel in October, 2010. I sincerely hope they have improved since then. The hotel is strategically located inside a large and multi-building meat, vegetable and fish distribution center so if you are looking for good views from your window or nearby attractions, do not waste your time. In my opinion it is very convenient for merchants who come from all over Europe to conduct their business as I was told. Believe me, it is not what you see in the website. I understand there is a restaurant but we did not go; breakfast was average. Our room was facing west so in the afternoon the room was extremely hot. I asked the receptionist to turn on the A/C unit and I was told that it was permanently turned off for the season. Could go into more disappointing details but to conclude, I just going to say that this hotel was part of a 7-day pre-paid package and we opted for losing our money and find another place to stay.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cGood value, good rest, good location\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR117669302", "Content": "If you have a car, this hotel is very good to stay at. Very quickly and very easily you'll get to the Madrid city center and you can even return to your hotel room for a quick rest before going back at dinner time. A very confortable bed and a room with a cosy and stylish look. Great bathroom with just the essencials. Wi-Fi and breakfast included in the price paid for the room. The breakfast was simple but with some variety - I enjoyed it! The only downer was that you had to call Telepizza if you wanted some room service or just to have dinner at the hotel - those are the worse pizzas you'll ever taste... The people at the reception were some what nice and not many. You can take your pet with you! A dog barked onde from inside a room. I was never disturbed by any animal. It was a very peaceful staying. The quality you get for your stay is very good for what you pay!", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Porto, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, Bad Location\u201d", "Author": "phferreira", "ReviewID": "UR88904883", "Content": "Very clean, comfortable and modern hotel with large beds and a beautifull shower.

Breakfast was continental style and brilliant, didn't eat other than that though because only stayed three nights and trips to and fro were just not an option because of bus times.
