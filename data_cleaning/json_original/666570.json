{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Near Freie Universit\u76f2t Berlin and Allied Museum Within walking distance of Oskar-Helene-Heim station, this hotel is located next door to the Consular Section of the US Diplomatic Mission to Germany and is a five-minute walk to Freie Universit\u76f2t Berlin and the Allied Museum. There are numerous restaurants in the area, including McDonalds. The hotel lacks an elevator and some rooms are on the fourth floor. My room was large and included a kitchen; however, there was no Internet access. The breakfast, which was included in the room price, was a buffet and very good. Service was very helpful and everyone spoke English, but there is no 24-hour desk.
