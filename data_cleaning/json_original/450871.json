{"Reviews": [{"Content": "lovely holiday My wife and I have just spent 25 nights at the White Rose with Mercury Direct and enjoyed it very much. It was good value for money. We flew with Qatar Airlines from Manchester and changed at Doha,Qatar. A very professional airline with excellent punctuality and service.AREA. Lots of shops nearby which you have to pass to reach the beach. The traders are friendly but can hassle you a bit. Just be prepared to smile and say no thanks. Alternatively you can take the free hotel coutesy bus.ROOM. Quite basic but very adequate. They are cleaned and linen is changed every day. TV includes 2 movie channels in English. Water is delivered free daily to your room. Air conditioning in all rooms and you do need it.FOOD. We were on half board. Buffet breakfasts were substantial with Asian and Western choices. At dinner our half board package with Mercury Direct allowed us to choose any starter, any main course and any dessert from the menu. Always well prepared food and an excellent choice.ENTERTAINMENT. It was quiet season but there were singers/musicians 2 or 3 nights a week but there is loads of entertainment 2 minutes walk away if you want it.STAFF. All were so friendly and helpful. Really nice people as are all the Bali people.POOL/GARDENS. Fabulous. Well maintained. Free sunbeds and towels.TRAVEL. We hired a driver who was very reasonably priced. He was reliable and spoke good english. He had a big air conditioned and modern car which would take 7 passengers. We hired him twice for 10 hours each time to see the island. His rate was cheap and it cost no more if there were more of you in the car. The first time we went as a group of 4 and the second time as a group of 6. Some people were disappointed with their drivers but I fully recommend Jimmy. Phone [-]. His E mail address is [-]OVERALL We were very pleased and hope to return to the same hotel in the not too distant future.", "Date": "Dec 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR115474874", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "davidSouthYorkshire"}, {"Content": "Loved the staff Stayed with husband and 3 children, 13 yr ,twins 10years old. Got the rooms we asked for. Staff were very helpful and always happy. They were always ensuring children were comfortable and OK. Rooms were always clean, although they are starting to show their age. People staying there were all friendly. Only thing you have to watch is what they book onto your room bill. Most people had discrepencies, we watched closely and had a few things needed to be credited. Easiest way is pay as you go. Meals and drinks very cheap at the hotel. No mini bar, which is great as you can fill fridge with supermarket food and drinks. Kids were made to feel very welcome. Location is fantastic.

I think I might not have been led accurately in this regard by my travel agent.OK, The White Rose, as many know, is up a short drive way from the Bali Bomb Memorial site. I chose this hotel due to heaps of great reviews. Soon after I booked I saw a few more recent ones that were a bit critical, but still giving a fair rating. I booked a room for myself and for my Korean friend meeting me in Bali. Being in a single, I found it annoying to get a room with 2 single beds, but this was changed when a vacancy came a few days later. Also, having booked the 2 rooms myself, thought it wasn't convenient to have my friend on the opposite side of the resort. My first room needed work. When you see brown stains on the roof, you realize that you skimped on expense in choosing a hotel. Also, when you are trying to keep the room dark and you see a crack a light coming in through the door (yes, door) because of a 15cm by 1cm (maybe 0.5cm) crack in it. I don't like the green curtins either. Plenty of photons online show the rooms, but I feel the internet make them look better than they are. The second room also had some roof stains, not heaps, but some. The second room also always had a sound like the next room had a shower running, but it wasn't as it was my friends room. Otherwise the rooms are neat (oh, standard rooms these are), with no safety deposit box, but they do have an empty bar fridge, which I like to have, sattelite tv also.The breakfast was good as often said by others. It included egg bread, toast, juices, sausages, bacon, eggs made to order (including omlettes), usually a rice and pasta option, fruit (though the fruit was a let down as it was not as juicy or soft as it could be. There were other options, each day had some variations. Some days we had breakfast upstairs above reception, at the end, we were eating at the pool area, its nice there, but too many ants around.The pool looks nice, but never had more than a few people in or around it. The grounds look nice also, with plenty of space.I found the staff at the area where the food and bar was (near the pool) were great, so friendly. The reception staff were hit and miss, some more serious than others, but no complaints and I am happy with them.# I must say, although this hotel is slightly off JL Legian, it wasn't always quiet. My first room was closer to the exit down to JL Legian, the second was as far away as it could be, but I could hear the clubs at times when trying to sleep. There are a number or bars there and I think even for clubs, the music volume is too loud. Also, I was kept awake at times by other people. Each set of 3 rooms have an open area with chairs and a table to be shared. If others use it, you are likely to hear conversation. For example, on Thurday night, the group from some bank had a meeting there going, they were still there when I arrived late at night and still talking until around 12:30pm. Other times I could hear toilet flushes, doors and people. The people staying there were varied. I never saw party goes there. Older couples, some younger coulpes also. There was a variety of nationalities and religous groups staying there also. It seemed that there were mostly Aussies and Indonesians staying there, though some were for a bank meeting there. Other nationalities were their also from what I could hear and recognise.The hotel I consider average, on a par with another I stayed at 9 years ago, the Barong, well, its better, but same category.", "Date": "Aug 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR686610444", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "lellel"}, {"Content": "Service,Staff We arrived here on the 21st June 2008 and left July 1st 2008 and felt very welcome the staff were so friendly especially staff at Resturant e.g Myani,Sarini,Santos and The 2 Dewas at Pool were very nice men.The rooms were in need of an upgrade but we hardly spent any time in there.The pool is absoulutley beautiful and The Hotel is central to he Beach and is 500 meters from the Main Street and Bomb Memorial.

Well what can I say but quite disapointing. We have stayed at The White Rose, 4 times now and with the recent change of ownership and the loss of Front Office Manager Joni Asia the place has gone down hill dramatically. While the old faithful staff are still there the place just doesnt have that welcome home feel we were used to.The new Manager was never there (quite a change from Joni being available for anything you might have needed) We have to ask several times for our privelege card reward, the room was not service daily and we had to repeatidly ask for water. We stayed in the new family suites as we travel with the kids (4  11) and while the set up is good 2 rooms both with ensuites kids upstairs 2 x single beds. The place stunk of mould and had dirty cutlrey left on the kitchen sink. We often had no hot water and went down to mum's room near the pool for a shower.It really is a shame that this has happened to The White Rose as I find the location convenient and until now it has been a fantastic property but when the kids notice the issues you know its pretty bad.I hope this property improves in the very near future but until then we will sadly be looking for a new Bali Home", "Date": "Jul 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR168584850", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Bali_teman"}, {"Content": "Faultless Holiday! Having only just returned from a very quick 5 day break, I felt the need to share my views about this fabulous property. I am a veteran of 8 trips to this island paradise and usually stay at a different property on each occasion sometimes two different hotels in the one trip for a unique experience. I have experienced the Padma, the Kartika Plaza, The Legian Beach, and the Hard Rock Hotel among several others and feel that the White Rose out does itself on every level possible and most importantly to me, the staff are absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone, young or old, for a complete Bali experience. The only traveller who will perhaps have an issue will be those who are wanting a beachfront property. (The beach at Kuta doesnt do it for me anyway!) The close proximity to restaurants, bars, shops, massage opportunity, money changers, phone shops, and possibly any thing else you may need will appeal to everyone. For value, facilities and most importantly those personal exchanges that shape your holiday experience, I can no longer stay at any other property in Bali as I now make the White Rose my special home in Kuta!", "Date": "May 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR561859846", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "felixthecat22"}, {"Content": "Wow...the new White Rose The White Rose in Kuta,We have stayed there for many years, did it need to improve\u9225\ue6d4ot reallyHas it improved\u9225\ufe39\u20ac\ue6bdOW A BIG YES.So what has happened.With the changes listed below the staff are now more enthusiastic and the service has improved.Many are the same faces that help to give you that \u9225\u6e1eeturned to your family\u9225?feeling.They smiled and respected us as guests, they cared about our needs and they listened to our suggestions.The foyer has been completely changed for the better, enlivened and is completely new, an honest money change service and tour and transport advice is on board, even includes a stunning bar with a relaxation centre in the reception area.Wow\u9225\ue6cft looks fantastic.And again\u9225?the staff now smile and really help.

Across the road there is ethnic food stalls with excellent local cuisines as well as established restaurants that cater to European and Asian tastes. There is also a chemist, bakery, health food and general stores with alcohol if you so desire and the streets are safe if you want to have a stroll after a great meal.At night we enjoyed a hotel meal and then we had a drink in the hotel bar with live background music and there\u9225\u6a9a also singing if you enjoy listening and on many occasions the lunch we chose was fresh made and the best.So\u9225\ue6dfes we will be back next year for what I am sure will be another great stay and visit our friends the management and staff at what we now call\u9225?OUR SECOND HOME.Kind RegardsFrank and Paula", "Date": "Apr 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR576414140", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Mr_Frank_and_Paula"}, {"Content": "great place..
