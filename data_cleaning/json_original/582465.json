But after staying I realise that the decision was right. Many positives but all coins have 2 sides. My flight was delayed for more that 10 hours...I managed to send a e-mail at 12 midnight to inform that I would arrive around 2 am..When I arrived of course the vehicle was not there but I used the counter at the airport (Tourist information centre - the person was helpful) then they cam to pick me within 15 minutes. Closer to airport - at Deira - Easy access through Red Metro as well. At check-in since the booking was made I just had to sign the form (no filling business) - 2 minutes I was sitting on the bed. Room was clean - small but that's good enough and was much bigger than few rooms I have stayed in Europe.. Liked to see eco friendly messages about the re-use of towel and which I encourage, but that was not working - may be the employees are not communicated properly since my towels were changed daily although they were hanged as instructed. Basics were available - shampoo, soap, creams etc... Good comfortable bed and Air conditioner could be controlled and had to be reduced since the climate was very good 23C. So sleeping was good. Helpful staff who were able to understand English. Pool on top floor - OK but check prior to the use whether someone there.. Plenty of eating places around, shopping places around...... Since my schedule was hectic I was not so bothered about the description below, nevertheless I should be saying so Safety locker is available but no instruction to operate, probably the management wants us to contact them..? Phone was not all that great - no in-house directory and the one-touch buttons ( to link reception, restaurant etc) were not working. Food - Not so great, Breakfast - repeat menus, Lunch was almost repeat but the worse was the lunch menu and the meals were served at dinner too on day 1. So if you are a food lover..mmm Wi-fi not available, Internet thro phone but does not function properly and staff lacked the tech knowledge to restore....I carried a BB that sorted things for me.

So to take a shower was quite a painful exercise. And especially in July in Dubai you would love to take a cold shower. When I complained I was told that the reason for this is climate change! Now climate change is certainly a serious topic, but only a day before I stayed on a business trip in the Moevenpick Hotel in Dubai, and strangely the Moevenpick was not affected by climate change... Breakfast in the Hallmark was awful. Believe it or not, there is no coffee! Only hot water and coffee powder. You might think this hotel is a reminiscence to the Soviet Union...

(another thing is at the time of my visit there was a construction project going on at the opposite side of the street. not very bothering, but a bit of noise in the morning.) also, it is a dry hotel. no alcohol is served in the hotel.

This was the case with the Hallmark as it was a last minute booking and few hotels were available due to a computer expo. Firstly, this hotel is located in a dusty backstreet of Deira, the old Dubai and is practically impossible to find. My contact there has lived in Dubai since 1991 and had never heard of it - nor had any taxi driver. On arrival I could see why. It is two or three stars at a push and yet cost the price of the Al Murooj Rotana (a superb 5-star)! Even though we arrived a day late due to flight delays they refused to deduct a night's room tariff even though our room had been rented to someone else and we had to wait for it to be cleaned! The rooms were shabby. I had to move within 5 minutes due to the noise of nearby building works. But the thing that really finished it for me was that, in 45 degrees celsius of heat and 80% humidity, there was NO cold running water. At all. None. Zilch. Seeing as how the water temperature was so hot that I could only wash my hair by diving in and out at half second intervals it was practically impossible to wash - not ideal in such a climate. On reporting the problem to reception I was told that there was nothing they could do. To top it off the rooftop pool was tiny - impossible to cool off there. Another issue which is admittedly not their fault, the Hallmark's location in the middle of crowded Deira, means that it feels substantially hotter than downtown Bur Dubai or Jumeirah. A local told me this too. Finally, and again, not their fault, and a point to remember if you're new to Dubai, is that the traffic in Deira is atrocious. This means that if you want to go to the beach/mall/anywhere be prepared for a long trip. It took us 1 hour and 10 mins to get to the Mall of the Emirates! In short, after day two I couldn't hack it any more and checked into the Al Murooj Rotana (which was booked out when we arrived) and breathed a deep sigh of relief! I've never written a negative review of any hotel before but I feel that Trip Advisor readers deserve to get an honest opinion. If you're on business in Dubai please try the Al Murooj Rotana (10 mins to the beach or the Mall) or the Movenpick. Much better value than the Hallmark. Otherwise head to Jumeirah. For similar cash I hear the Habtoor Grand is great.

Not too far to Deira City for the start of the Big Bus Tour, close to the Creek for a Dhow cruise or Abra ride to Bur Dubai. Recommend the China Club Restaurant at the Raddisson close by. Didn't use many of the hotel facilities, except for the rooftop pool which is a great place to relax. The rooms were comfortably furnished. Only gripe is that the 2 bottles of drinking water provided on the first day was not replaced by the Chamber Maid, so suggest buying your own supply as the tap water is not drinkable.

We booked our stay at the Hallmark after reading the (then) one review on TripAdvisor. While the ongoing renovations meant the lobby was under various stages of construction, we enjoyed our stay at the Hallmark and loved the location within one block to Al Ghurair City Shopping Centre and with a free shuttle bus to Deira City Centre. With an infant, we appreciated that while the hotel was 4 star, it did not serve alcohol and thus we did not have a nightclub (or several) and the accompanying noise to contend with. There is construction everywhere in Dubai so any surrounding noises were expected and no problem. The buffet breakfast, while sometimes a bit crowded (this was alleviated when the hotel opened an adjacent room to accommodate everyone), was so delicious - particularly the local offerings - moutabal, hummus, feta, etc. Our favorite aspect, as Americans, were the many Iranian guests we met at the Hallmark during our stay. All, without exception, were warmly welcoming to the region and made our stay at the Hallmark extra special (as did the lovely Ethiopian woman who works in the lobby cafe). There is a pool and fitness area on the top floor although we did not use these as it was so hot in August - I imagine it would be nice at other times of year. There is also an excellent and cheap juice/shwarma place around the corner - Infinity.com I think. Very refreshing watermelon juice. Given how expensive Dubai is, our room rate (@ $99 USD per night) made the Hallmark an excellent and recommended value.

When we were finally shown our rooms they were both single rooms, we complained that this was unacceptable as we had booked doubles their response was carefree with no consideration to try and sort this out immediately.We were then offered to stay in these rooms as no other room would be ready until 14.00hrs, we agreed to this but ended up staying in these rooms for our whole 14 days as nothing ever got sorted out. The hotels rating states a 4star as it has been recently refurbished, this is not the case, our stay involved us having to accomodate around the on going work night and day.We didnt use the coffee shop due the dust and noise of workmen in the reception and during the evening you would need a mask if you ventured downstairs as they were using sray paint. The hotel reception staff sat behind their desks of a evening with the doors open all masked up, so this meant the downstairs coffee/lounge was out of use unless you wanted to sit amongst this.The bathrooms were of a decent size but sorry to say I wish the hygiene was to. We reported this,and they sent a maintenance man up with the cleaner to inspect the black mould that was growing around the bath.We also pointed out that the light switch on the head board had loose live wires hanging out and the window had a broken handle and was held in by one screw.Wallpaper was ripped and it looked if as someone had had their dirty feet on the wall and the air conditioning unit was constantly leaking.The reponse was the hotel was in the process of being refurbished and it will look lovely when its all finished but for now there was nothing they could do.You could imagine our anger as this was no use to us, we had paid for a 4 stat hotel,no compensation or even to change our rooms was offered, they said the hotels manager would get back to us and we handed them the completed guest service form.By the time our holiday had come to an end no one got back to us, we are so relieved to be home to get some sleep as I must also mention that there constant building work going on at the back of the hotel (looks as if a another hotel is to be errected), this kept my children awake due the 24hrs generators running.

When 'Value Added Travel' recommended the hotel to us I was concerned that I couldn't find it in any of the Travel books, nor had it been rated on the Trip advisor website, which I always consult in advance of making a holiday booking. 'Value Added' said that the facilities couldn't be bettered at the price, so we decided to take a risk. Eventually I found a mention of the Hallmark in the 2005 Footsteps guide, and then realised that it was probably too new to have made the other editions The hotel is family run and couldn't have done more to make our holiday the success that it was. They arranged complementary airport transfers both ways,all the staff were helpful and friendly, Reception provided good advice on trips and things to do etc The Hallmark is about 5 minutes drive from the Airport in downtown Deira, but being positioned in between Al Rigga Road and Al Maktoum Road , it is remarkably free from traffic noise and as no alcohol is served on the premesis there was no bar to disturb us either! We only saw/ heard planes when using the rooftop swimming pool and sunbathing area. As the Hallmark is only 2 years old, it is still in pristine condition, Standard Rooms are a good size - fitting in an extra bed for our 9 year old daughter was no problem - with all the usual 4* facilities. There are Monet prints on the walls and lovely deep baths in the ensuite. We were concerned that staying in a city centre location could be a disadvantage, especially as our daughter loves the beach, but this is compensated for by the daily morning shuttle to and from the Jumeriah Beach Park (nominal 5 Dhrs entrance per person) about 20 minutes drive away. There's also a free shuttle to a nearby Shopping Mall at 4pm daily (return at 8pm) Food at the hotel was good. There's an excellent complementary Buffet Breakfast and the Coffee shop is open all day until well into the evening, serving a good range of snacks, pasta/pizzas etc. The Restaurant serves a really good Buffet at lunchtime, prices both there and in the Coffee Shop are reasonable and well below what one would pay for similar fare in England Although the Rooftop pool is on the small side it is an ideal spot to relax and sunbathe. Towels are provided and there are a good supply of chairs and umbrellas So top marks to the Hallmark, and also to Value Added Travel, for having such good local knowledge and recommending the hotel to us.
