Very clean and new rooms on top of friendly service. It is right next to the metro station and you can go everywhere in Rome in just a few minutes. Staying a little bit out of the city center and turistic places help you to taste authentic italian restaurants paying good prices. Recommend also Ristorante da G Roma, just around the corner.

The nine rooms of the hotel are on half of a floor of an otherwise normal building. This is right above the Furio Camillo metro station (on the same line as the stops for the Termini station, the Spanish Steps and Via Veneto) but the surrounding area really is unremarkable and you are dependent on the metro, which due to construction at the moment is only open until 9pm (after which there is a bus replacement). The rooms, while not large, have a modern and comfortable fit-out which appears relatively new. Having stayed in two different rooms there is some variation - one was over the road and had quite a bit of traffic noise, but one overlooked a rooftop garden area with a French window arrangement. The beds are very comfortable and every room is fitted out with security cards. They centre in on one main corridor. Noise does resonate a little within the hotel. There is free wi-fi and a basic continental breakfast in a small breakfast room. Service is very intent and will be appreciated by those who like the concept of being hosted. All in all it fits the style of a pension (albeit one which is not in the middle of a particularly charismatic area but is accessible to them). For the amount I paid I was really quite satisfied and I would certainly recommend it to those looking for this style of hotel in Rome.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holb\u00e6k, Danmark", "Title": "\u201cCozy littel hotel.\u201d", "Author": "NGSD", "ReviewID": "UR118841051", "Content": "Very cleen and cozy hotel with a very serviceminded hostess.

It is located just next (literally 7-8 meters walk) to Furio Camillo metro station (from where Termini or the Spanish Steps is a matter of a few minutes). The interior is beautifully decorated, and the rooms are at the levels of 4* hotels. Everything is really tasteful and functional. Breakfast is included in the price, and there is fridge with water, beverages and snacks for free use in every room... Beds are great and the place is very quite for relaxation once you return from your exploration of Rome. The hosts are very kind, unobstrusive, and very helpful. In its price this hotel is just one of the best places to stay - literally 4* accommodation for a 2* price. Near the hotel, around 70 meters walk, there is a great traditional Italian Restaurant (you have to visit it to have a taste of real Italian food) with the name Hosteria.
