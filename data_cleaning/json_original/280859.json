While the reviews cautioned that this was in a more dangerous neighborhood, we found it to be lively and delightful. It was nice not staying directly on Las Ramblas, as the commotion there could get to be a bit much. We were a quick walk from Las Ramblas (less than ten minutes) and to a few metro stations as well. They did offer a continental breakfast, but at 12 euros or so, we never made that our breakfast place. There is a cute cafe next door for an affordable breakfast and a cafe con leche. We dined there each morning for about 5 euros per person. There are also many other little restaurants nearby that were quite good within a 5 minute walk. We appreciated that so we could avoid the tourist traps on Las Ramblas serving overpriced mediocre food. Prices were fair for the space. I think we paid approximately 125 USD each night for our room, which was pretty reasonable. The hotel was modern and clean. The rooms were comfortable and spacious for European hotel standards with newer bathrooms. Wifi was free. My only gripe was that for each time you wanted to log on, you had to be in the lobby and get a password. While I appreciated not having to incur an additional fee for this service, the passwords often didn't work, leading us to not have internet access. There is a desktop computer in the lobby for guest use, which is convenient. All in all, I'd stay here again. I can see why some might find the location a bit seedy, but I appreciated the fact that we glimpsed many vibrant cultures that make up the truly European city of Barcelona. Be cautious, and take a taxi if you don't feel comfortable. That being said, we didn't use taxis, aside from to get to the airport the morning we left.

The Palau Guell is abs.stunning inside. Its. v.short walk, other side of Las Ramblas, to the gothic quarter, where there are lots of shops and restaurants.

It's also just a few mins walk from Paral.lel and St Antoni metro stations.

The room was OK - clean, reasonable beds, a bathroom with a bath and shower, air con, and a safe large enough to fit my laptop in. Bad points: The bathroom smelled bad, particularly after the shower had steamed it up. This was the the common southern European bathroom smell, writ large. \"Room service\" was a tele-pizza service. You dial room service, and the receptionist just puts your straight through to the pizza place, who (on the occasion I called) spoke no language that I recognised - the guy at the end of the phone seemed to be fluent only in Shouty. I had to go to reception to as them to call, which worked fine, although the receptionist seemed grumpy at me asking him to do this.

It was our first time in Barcelona and a single friend had suggested the hotel due to very reasonable prices plus the fact that it was really central, a few minutes from the Ra Rambla. We have nothing but good words for the hotel itself. It was clean, spacious and we were given rooms looking front on the 3rf floor. The staff was very nice, helped us with maps, suggestions for reastaurants, tickets for flamengo dance etc and breakfast was super. But I do not know if I would choose it again ,as the neighbourhood looked dangerous. Barcelona is a wonderful city, full of nice neighbourhoods and I think we stayed at one of the worse. Dirty, bowery, we really did not feel safe to walk especially at night. It was a side of Barcelona we would not have seen if we had stayed elsewhere and I would not recommend it for families.

We decided to walk from the square where the Aerobus from the airport dropped us. Straight down the Rambla until we saw the L'hospital Road and turned in. It was night time and yes I understand that the graffitti and the downbeat look of the area can be a little intimidating, but we liked the offbeat path that it provided. There were few hookers on the street corners and the inhabitants made up maiinly of North & West Africans, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis from what I could make out. We didn't feel at all threatened, maybe cos I am tall and look like an arab and blended with the 'background'. Infact we enjoyed a couple of meals in the square at night (outside) and in the morning found a really good cafe where we had breakfast so cheap it was unbelievable - Forns del PJ - found as you walk back to La Rambla on the L'Hospital Road and on the right just as you enter the last square. We even sat talking on the benches in the square for a couple of hours one evening. As for the hotel, I specifically asked for a double bed in the email and it was confirmed to me that they would have one for us. But in the room, it was 2 singles put together. I complained but they said it was because we checked in late(???) as we arrived at 10pm!! Lousy escuse. One or two things weren't right and were fixed the next day. The rooms were small but didn't matter as we didn't spend much tme there. The electronic safe in the wardrobe was a great help as we only carried what we needed to. On the last day we stopped by the Funicular near the Olympic Stadium. When we got to the bottom, we were within walking distance of the hotel where we were able to dump some stuff before moving on to other sightseeing. The hotel sells the 1 and 2 day passes on the Turistic open-top Buses. Go for the 2-day pass. 26Euros each and the same price as when you queue in the square. Don't be put off by the area. There are a lot of good shops selling stuff like fashion jewellry (which if you have lots of people to buy for) was a bargain as you can haggle with the chinese owner. He gave us a price below what I was prepared to pay. Then there were the local groceries selling 1Litre bottles water for 60 cents as opposed to a can of Coke outside the Musea D'Art for 5 Euros!!!!! Ladies, just make sure the handbags are sandwiched between you and your partner when out walking, men, don't put your wallet in your back pocket.

The TV wasn't working but they had an engineer up within 5 minutes of my phoning down to reception who fixed it straight away. It is true that the location isn't the ritziest and glamourous in all of Central Barcelona as it is an area of immigrants. I didn't feel in the slightest bit intimidated there though (mind you, I have lived in some pretty scary places in my time!).
