{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Historic and central, but unexpectedly noisy We stayed at one of the newly available apartments, the Matilda. It is on the Pizza Santo Spirito in a central location, from which you can easily walk to the main sights. The apartment has a pleasant large double bedroom, a small, nice, but sparsely furnished child's bedroom with bunk beds, a rather dark but spacious livingroom with two small sofas, and a very small dark kitchen. The bathroom was disappointing: it was tiny, and the overhead shower simply rains down onto the middle of the bathroom floor, with no shower cubicle or proper shower curtain. After each shower, the whole floor was an inch deep in water which took a while to drain away, and the next person to enter the room had to go in bare feet with their trousers rolled up!We were not prepared for the noise in the square outside. Each night when the nearby bars filled up, and people spilled onto the square, the noise level was startling. After a few hours of quiet in the middle of the night, the market stall holders began to arrive and it all started again. We all had to wear ear plugs every single night. The square has its share of undesirable characters who were always in evidence, even during the day. The apartment has an agreeable historical feel, the location is good, and the landlord was charming. However, anyone who's thinking of renting the apartment should be prepared for the noise outside.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR648526514", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "noteworth"}, {"Content": "Excellent apartment in the middle of Florence       view of piazza del mercato centrale", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR788967398", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ccoquia"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d617532-r16973361-Via_della_Chiesa_17_Apartments-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "617532", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
