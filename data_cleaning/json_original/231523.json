I requested a balcony and if I hadn't had that, I couldn't have stayed there. My room had the smallest shower I've ever seen. I could get inside but couldn't turn right or left after that. The location is excellent because I can walk to most places I want to visit. The neighbourhood has plenty of bars, restaurants and shops. The cleaning staff is very active--I had to tell them not to bother every day as I didn't want to be disturbed. The rest of the staff is also very good and helpful. The breakfast (5.80) is probably a better deal than what's available in the neighbourhood. They probably have some rooms that are larger than mine but the receptionist said that basically all are small. If you're spending all day away from the hotel, maybe this isn't important to you.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "TareqHaji", "ReviewID": "UR125874741", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel during MWC event in 2012. During this time, 64,000 exhibitions visitors came to Barcelona requiring accommodation which lead to the natural inflation of the hotel rates. This two-star hotel charged me Euro180 per night. I personally would not pay more than Euro50 if it wasn't a business trip. Pros: - I found the hotel location excellent, very close to a metro station (line L2 and L3). Only two stops from the Fira (Espanya metro station). - the room was clean and spacious (it was a twin bedroom). I was told by a colleague that in contrast the single bedroom is ridiculously small. - Walking distance to Ramblas (popular tourist spot) - Even though I had my window open, the street was relatively quiet and I slept well. - The shower had strong water pressure and hot water. Cons: - There was a TV screen which seemed no more than 21\" LCD suspended from the ceiling. Only Spanish channels were available so I never watched any TV there. - The rooms had virtually no sound isolation, I can hear every word my neighbors were saying, sneeze, toilet flush, etc. - The toilet is clean, but the sink was tiny and you had to sit at angle when doing your business as the bathtub was in the way (see pic).", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, US", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for the money.\u201d", "Author": "xenagurl", "ReviewID": "UR125680313", "Content": "Nice little hotel centrally located to make getting around easy.

Safe area about a 20 minute walk from Las Ramblas and near the stop for the HoHo buses. A tad noisy if your neighbors are up late and the elevator a bit slow.

The room reminded me of a college dorm room, very spartan. The bed was rough on my neck and back, I had to stuff a couch cushion under my pillow. We reserved a \"double\" and it had a full size bed, and a full size futon. The room also had a desk, large window, tiny TV, closet space, and a bathroom. The bathroom smelled strongly enough of mildew that we kept the door closed at all times. The furniture in the bathroom was peeling and cracking. After our first shower we realized the back wall of the shower was not water tight and water flooded the bathroom, hallway, and part of our room. But once we aimed the shower head away from the back wall, it was fine. In fact the shower was fantastic: we always had hot water and it was some of the strongest water pressure I've felt! Now having said all of that....it was nice. It was quiet (although we were there in January), two blocks off of Avda Paral-el. The staff were very nice, helpful, polite...they suggested very close by restaurants. The hotel is within walking distance of La Rambla, and very close to a metro stop that'll get you anywhere.
