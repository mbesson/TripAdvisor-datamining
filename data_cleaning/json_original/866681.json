After having stayed there for a week (Dec. 26- Jan 2), I agree. Where to start. The property itself is simply amazing. The common areas of the atrium, bar, and restaurant are extraordinarily beautiful. We were in a deluxe room which was stunning. It was a very quiet room that opened to an interior space. The bed and furnishings were top notch. The bathroom was heavenly. The size of the bathroom was without equal in Europe. The staff of the hotel was simply extraordinary. We relied on the concierge greatly and they came through big time with spot-on restaurant recommendations and reservations, side-trip excursions and museum reservations. The food in the restaurant was other worldly. We had the special New Years Eve dinner there which as fabulous. Breakfast was also so elegant and tasty. The spa was fabulous. My massage therapist was excellent. The location is about a 10 minute walk from the heart of the action,but we appreciated the distance from the hub bub. Charges within the hotel are not inexpensive, but in our mind everything was worth it. It is hard to imagine a hotel in all of Italy (and perhaps Europe) which could be better. As you can tell, we loved every aspect of our visit, and we recommend it without any hesitation.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR217006547", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "HotelGuestTraveler"}, {"Content": "Impeccable What can you say? This hotel is really out-of-this-world. The building is exquisite and how many other urban hotels can boast such extensive gardens? Maybe our only regret was that we weren't at the hotel in summer to take better advantage of the latter. The service is really wonderful and attentive... so much so that the waiters were almost falling over each over to serve us at breakfast. One was particularly great. When he brought us our toast, he said to us: I'm going to go and fetch some more because I don't think they've given you enough. Absolutely charming! Otherwise, the Chardonnay in the bar is delicious and the d\u8305cor is wonderfully refined. We actually almost didn't book the hotel after seeing some Travellers photos of the rooms. But, we're glad we did because they are so much nicer in reality. Our bathroom was also wonderfully luxurious and the actual bedroom looked over the courtyard where the bar is... which was nice for a bit of people-watching in the evening. We didn't have dinner at the restaurant, but the breakfast food was definitely top-class. The valet parking service was also great. When we got back to head off to the airport, our hire car was already waiting for us in front of the door. Before going to Florence, we read reviews that said that the location was a problem and that the hotel was not as central as other properties. However, we actually liked the more secluded nature of the Four Seasons (a welcome respite for the crowds around the tourist sites) and it is only a leisurely 10-minute stroll away from the Duomo. If we had to be really picky, then we'd mention the fact that the bed was a big hard for our liking and that there were no nail files in the room. We also couldn't locate a hotel directory... which would have been useful when we were wondering until what time breakfast was served. But, those are really minor niggles and maybe what we liked best about the hotel is that although the building is really grandiose, the atmosphere is somehow wonderfully intimate. All in all, we can only thank all the staff at the Four Seasons for such a wonderful stay and encourage anyone heading to Florence to make a booking there. It may be pricey, but it's definitely worth the money.", "Date": "Dec 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR529691951", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ianp1"}, {"Content": "Wow       Deluxe room", "Date": "Dec 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR461709903", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "b737"}, {"Content": "The Best Four Seasons, the Best Hotel in the world I and my husband booked this trip to Florence because we wanted to see the new Four Seasons Hotel.

My husband and I had the good fortune of staying at this lovely property during its soft opening at the end of June. Upon arrival the staff swarmed our taxi whisking away our luggage and asking questions to the point where my husband couldn't even close out our business with the taxi driver. The staff was very eager to assist! Upon check-in we were upgraded to a deluxe room. The rooms look exactly as pictured on the Four Season's website. Our room had a view the garden which is situated at the rear of the hotel so street noise was not an issue. I don't believe there were other guests in the nearby rooms so it's hard to tell how sound proofed the rooms are. We were told by one of the employees that this property is a former palazzo that had been privately owned by some Italian business and the Four Season's purchased it several years ago and has been renovating it for many years! The previous business had painted many of the walls with white paint directly over several frescoes. The Four Season's has restored the walls to what looks like museum quality. You really feel like you're in a museum when you're in several of the public areas---especially the entry where there is a replica statue and the walls and ceiling are covered in frescoes. It's simply amazing! Additionally, one unique thing I noticed is that the employees seem genuinely proud of the hotel and proud to work there. If they notice you looking at some of the art or frescoes they will stop what they're doing and come right over to tell you about what you're looking at and attempt to answer questions. There is also a lovely spa, fitness and pool area at the back of the hotel among the gardens. When you're in this area you would never imagine you're in Florence or a city for that matter! It really felt like you're at an elegant resort instead away from any city. Since we arrived prior to their official opening they did not have any special packages available so all food was a-la-carte. We did not have dinner at the hotel but, we did have breakfast one morning and although it was good, it was extrodinarily expensive! We just had juice and coffee. I had French Toast and my husband had Irish Oatmeal. Although the food was very good, the bill came to about $75EU so after converting to USD, I consider that quite excessive for breakfast. Prior to our arrival, the concierge staff had booked 2 dinner reservations per my request. I had actually done my own research so I wasn't using them for recommendations but, I noticed that the two restaurants I had selected were on their list of restaurant recommendations. When the concierge forwarded me our confirmations by email, she also sent along their listing of restaurant recommendations for some reason. Other than the dining reservations we had them make, we didn't use the concierge for anything while we were there so I can't comment on them otherwise. The only real negative I could find is the location of the hotel compared with other high end hotels such at the Lungarno Hotels. As the previous reviewer mentioned, the Four Season's is not right in the heart of things. It's about a good 15-20 minute walk to the Duomo and other tourist sites. I knew that before booking the hotel so I can't say that this was a surprise. I really don't like the street the hotel is on. Especially at night because it's narrow, not well lit and there were some strange characters lurking. Even with that said, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel because it's such a unique property, especially within a city. If you have the good fortune to stay here, I'm sure you will love it despite the location!", "Date": "Jul 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR637754703", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RMCONNERS"}, {"Content": "Michelangelo would be impressed.
