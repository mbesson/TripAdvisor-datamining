When we arrived at 10pm the lady at reception was on the phone. We thought she was talking to a customer so we waited, 5 minutes later we realised she was talking to her friend so I said I'd like to check in. She rolled her eyes and told her friend to hold. I later found out that this woman was actually the night manager! Things only went worse from there. The next night we went to the reception again and asked for some tea bags, a new hotel receptionist asked 'Why? Have you used all of yours yet?' Honestly, you're talking about a teabag! Finally the night before we checked out, we returned a travel adapter that we had borrowed. We had to leave a 5 pound deposit so we requested the money back. Another receptionist asked us for our receipt - when we paid our deposit, we asked for a receipt and was told we didn't need one?? We then asked them to check their books as we know our details were written down when they took our deposit and low and behold it was there. The guy then agreed to give us 4 pounds back, but then the night manager (the rude lady from the first night) said no, we had to have our receipt - even though they had our details written down! We stood there stunned, in the meantime, another guest came down and asked for new sheets as his daughter had thrown up on the bed. He was told that house keeping was closed and that he could not get new sheets until tomorrow! I tried to talk to the night manager to explained how ridiculous it was that we couldn't get our deposit back, but she put on her jacket and said her shift was over!!! Luckily I was able to try and talk some sense into the guy I had been dealing with and he offered us some compensation - two bottles of water! Besides the terrible service, the rooms were old, the wall papers were pulled off the walls, no wi-fi, you couldn't adjust the heating (which was only turned on at night), the bathroom is so small you cant open the door fully as it hits the toilet and the food was awful. The only good thing was the location. I would NOT recommend this hotel to my worst enemy! Looking at some of these reviews it seems like I'm not the only one who think this place was an absolute s#it hole!", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFamilies, stay away.

Unfortunately, we were greatly disappointed. First we spend like 40 mins to walk around with all of our luggage searching for the hotel, as the route explained on their website is not correct - Finally we found it, and it looked alright from the outside. However, as soon as we entered we could feel this was a really old hotel. The staff at the frontdesk did not seem too polite, only the manager seemed eager to oush us pretty hard in order to sell us \"Big Bus\" tour tickets.. hey, we just travelled for 6 hours, pls give us a break! The super small elevator which can only take 3 persons was making dangerous sounds as it would stop anytime and took us to the 3rd floor. The room was narrow, small, smelled like a really old place which had not seen the sign of fresh air for months - and it was hot like a boiling sauna. Bathroom was acceptable, nothing fancy. Everywhere we stepped on the floor it would make big \"squirking\" sounds - we could hear this from everywhere in the hotel, so whenever someone walked in the rooms surrounding us our in the corridors you would easily notice. The bed was very hard, not comfy at all, and made noisy sounds aswell when moving around. We slept with the window wide open all night long, otherwise it would be too hot - but it was only 4 degrees winter-time outside.. and the heater was totally cold. No idea where that extreme heat came from. Breakfast was mentioned to be \"superior English breakfast\" - it was lousy non-tasting-cheap bread.. no fruits.. not even eggs, bacon or anything making it a English breakfast. Do not go to this hotel, unless you get it at a bargain and just need a place to crash.. and know in advance that you will feel so tired that you won't even notice the sounds when people are around during the night.... Only pros are that it is located like 10 mins walk to the tube/underground/metro station Baywater, and you've got alot of stores and shops within 10 mins walking distance aswell. Oh.. and last thing.. no minibar or even a refridgerator in the tiny narrow room either to keep things you buy downtown cooled down.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWorse than YHA, and cost much more!!!\u201d", "Author": "Shovelbum", "ReviewID": "UR91756251", "Content": "I am writing this the night I checked in, coz' it's just horrible!!!

We got lost looking for the hotel because our taxi driver did not know the exact location! When we arrived, my father went to check us in and when we got to our room (which was a double), we were surprised because the room was just big enough for the double bed and dressing table! Tired and feeling nausea, I stayed in the room while my father went back to the reception to ask for a bigger room. I made myself a cup of hot tea, and feeling revived, I was about to look for my parents when a hotel staff came to the room and told me that our luggage will be taken to our new room. Hmm... I thought, my father must have worked his charm with the lady on duty that afternoon at the reception counter! The second room was big enough, it had a double bed and 2 tvs with a sofa sitting area. The bathroom was really nice and big too! Yes, as a Muslim, we found it hard to find space to place our prayer mat and perform our daily prayer, but we managed to find space. Before arriving at the hotel, I've read some of the reviews and found them not helpful at all, because how could I judge something I've not seen and experienced? I was prepared for anything, and some things that stood out for me was the friendliness of the \"lady\" on the day that we arrived, Ms.A, she even came to our room, once, to make sure everything was okay, she apologized to me and tried to explain a mistake she made on the bill she presented to MY father, she issued me a new hotel room card without extra charge when I accidently placed the original elsewhere and everytime she saw us she waved and gave us a big smile. Little did I know she was from Malaysia, because during our first encounter, she spoke English with British accent and when she suddenly spoke in Malay, I was pleasantly surprised! During our stay, I had a chance to meet the Manager of the hotel's son, who worked part-time at the restaurant, very helpful and always ready with a smile, a Malaysian student working part-time, A, who showed me places of interest on the map one evening at the reception counter when there were no customers, Ms. N, whom I met one bright morning, she was very cheerful and friendly, Mr. M, who also showed me places of interest on the map, another Mr. M, whom I called one early morning to ask for the iron, and he said I can use it at no charge, because I think he was leaving his night shift in half an hour and said to just mention his name when I return the iron and board to the reception, and when I did, the staff just nodded and smiled at me! (the hotel asks for a 10 pound deposit and for each hour, they charge one pound)! The food... no complains. I'm grateful that the breakfast and dinner that we had at the hotel was adequate and full of variety. I don't want to sound bias, since I am a Malaysian and a Muslim and HV is a Malaysian run hotel, but the food was good and HALAL. The restaurant staff, every morning, never fail to smile and serve us well. The breakfast spread which consisted of cereals, buns, juices, jams, toasts, slices of cheese made it easy for my father to choose what he wanted, since he was a fussy eater and was on medication. And you can even order nasi lemak (rice cooked in coconut milk with condiments such as egg, slices of cucumber, fried chicken), roti canai (3 pieces of this famous Malaysian breakfast with a big bowl of chicken curry serving!). I can never forget the creaking sound of the wooden floor at the food area every morning during breakfast, I didn't know whether to laugh out loud or tell the stranger next to me about it, guess I'll keep it as special memory of my exprience in Holiday Villa, London 2008. Location wise, like been said in previous reviews, HV is situated very conveniently. As you step outside the hotel, (while I was there, the front facade was adorned with colorful flowers and a sight to behold), the shops are all within walking distance. Tesco, Boots, Whitleys shopping centre (they have a Mark&Spencer department), tube station, travel agency, post office, groceries, souvenir shops..

After threatening to call the travel agent, incidentally my step mother, they relented and gave us the crappiest roll away bed they could find. With is in the room we barely had room to move about.

For the first two days of our stay there was no problem but for the last three days I was not able to connect. Enquiries to reception and management we met with a blanket denial first then an \"our system does not allow 0800 calls\". When pressed as to why I could for the first two days they then said \"oh that was a mistake\". As part of this they has also inadvertently blocked all out going calls. Attempting to call a UK cellphone and the Cosmos confirmations number resulted in disconnected calls after the first ring. Calling from my NZ cellphone, which is expensive, went through immediately. Again querying management were met with rude denials. Regarding the facilities, I too found mould in the bathroom. This was in the shower door joints and the liquid soap dispenser holder. It looked like it had never been cleaned. The soap dispenser was empty after the first shower and it took two days for it to be refilled.

It wasn't a two-star with five-star asperations. It isn't a hidden gem. It is what it is. My sister & I stayed for a week in January. It was part of a package deal. The reviews concerned me as they were all over the place. While I happily stay at Ys, and hostels, my sister normally stays at more expensive locations. That said, we both thought that the hotel was acceptable. Our room was long and narrow, with too much space given over to \"hall\" and not enough between beds and desk. If you're an American, you'll probably find their twin beds narrower than ours. You might find that they are too close. (We solved that by remaking the beds. I slept with my head at the foot of the bed.) My sister thought that the matresses needed to be replaced. You can't use a hairdryer in the bathroom, and my sister thought that the light was lacking in the bedroom for doing her hair, etc. As to the bathroom, it is the second time I've stayed at a London hotel that had a bathroom blocked, in part, by the toilet, BUT had 9 to twelve inches of space between its end, and a wall. It if had been moved over 9 or 12 inches, I would have felt more comfortalbe exiting it. There's little storage space (an armoir and a desk). I thought that the bathroom was clean, the carpet faded, and the neighborhood relatively quiet. The continental breakfast was fine. There was toast, rolls, croissants, butter, coffee, OJ, milk, cereal, yogurt, etc. The front staff answered any questions asked, and the young man who was working the desk - I forgot to get his name - was a treasure. He offered many suggestions on places to see and eat.. My sister's request at registration for a second pillow was promptly answered by an otherwise quiet young woman.

It is quiet and we felt safe any time we were out and about. The desk would not call for a metered cab for us when we were checking out. We had them call a cab for us to go to a theatre in covent gardens. We failed to ask what the fare would be before we left. We ended up paying 18 BPS for the trip. An expensive lesson learned. The only other disappointment occured at the Greek restaurant down the street from the Hotel. The name of the place is \"Zorba the Greek\".

Everything to do with it was awful, and I'm not usually very fussy about where to stay. I chose here as it was a last minute trip and availability in London wasn't great, also they were offering B&B at \u00c2\u00a375 a night, good for London I felt. However, like any accomodation this cheap in London, there's a major price to pay. To be positive, the hotel is a 2-minute walk from Bayswater Tube, and is excellently served by buses, taxis, all public transport, and it's a minute or two's walk from Hyde Park, Notting Hill and a few minutes from Paddington station. The road where it's based is in a nice location, with lots of white-fronted multi-storey townhouses, the type that make London famous, particularly in its more affluent areas. But that's where the positivity ends, I'm afraid. The hotel is in dire need of renovation, it clearly hasn't been touched since the 80s and everywhere stinks of cigarette smoke and sweat (despite the fact that I requested a non-smoking room). I was told upon checking in that during my 2-night stay, I would have to change rooms which was annoying, but a necessary evil, so I was willing to overlook the fact that this was stated to me with no apology by the grumpy receptionist. I checked in, and was moved to a room on the left extremity of the fourth floor which was apparently a double - if the two people staying there are both 6 stone! It was tiny and very basically furnished - no hairdryer or trouser press (very annoying considering I had a formal business meeting the next day), and not even any coffee, biscuits or soap or shower gel etc! Mind you, these are only garnishes to me when it comes to checking into a hotel but it goes to show the contempt in which they clearly hold their clientele. The room was sordid and sleazy, the paper was falling off the walls, there was mould on the ceiling and in the bathroom. To make things dramatically worse, I went to bed that night early for my business appointment the following day, only to be woken up at 2am the next night by the very loud lady next door. There were loud knocks on the door every half-hour, and a loud \"hello\" being uttered by both her and her male callers - make what you will of that, considering that it went on from 2am until 6am that night. I reported it to the desk but was told that she was a regular client to the hotel and considering that my room was going to be moved anyway it shouldn't be a problem anymore - not the ideal satisfactory response I was hoping to get but anyway...... So I vowed to spend as much time as possible out of the hotel for the rest of the trip, which resulted in me having a good weekend I guess! To be fair, my bags were moved to the other room (which was single and absolutely miniscule, but thankfully my neighbours were much quieter). Both rooms were extremely hot and stuffy, even though the radiator was switched off and there was no air-con of any kind in either the room or the bathroom, so they really need to do something about this - I could barely sleep the second night it was so stifling - and this is London in November, what must it be like in July?! In fact I was so overheated I chose to walk round London the following day with no coat on as I was almost rendered nauseous with the heat. And speaking of nauseous - breakfast. Absolutely awful, awful, awful. The only edible stuff they had was toast and small little pastries, no fresh fruit, no cereal and no other options at all bar extremely watery juice which was dispensed from a dodgy-old looking machine. Oh, and tea and coffee. The dinner menu didn't look brilliant either, I saw a few room service plates being left outside rooms, that were barely touched and to be quite frank looked sloppy and not very edible. The final touch was when I checked out, I asked for my bags to be left, as my train was not until 5pm that night. This was not a problem, however bear in mind that when I returned to pick them up, the receptionist left me to my own devices and I was left in a left luggage room to collect what I wanted - potentially I could have left with anything I wanted (none of the bags were tagged by the hotel as belonging to anyone in particular). Nobody noticed when I left either. Oh, and did I add that I was behind the counter at the time and was free to do what I wanted as well? Very poor security there. So all in all, despite the price paid, I wouldn't go near the place again. I think London's private non-corporate owned hotels need to take a good look at themselves and buck up their game, as this really put a downer on my trip. It really is non-hygenic and a grotty little place, and as noted earlier, not for the easily offended or the woman on her own (as I was).", "Date": "November 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockaway, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cCould it be any smaller???\u201d", "Author": "TravelBug102", "ReviewID": "UR5936319", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel last week as part of a Virgin Vacations package.

First the elevator is rated for a max. of three people, 2 with 1 suitcase each, whenit was working. When we got to the room, it was small with 2 single beds the were hard as a rock no longer than 5 foot, and a cot that was so soft you sank in.

I arrived early in the day to store my luggage, and all was well. The management teased me a bit, but in a friendly manner. When I returned to officially check-in later that evening, I was at the desk all of 30 seconds before I was given my key. Because of some difficulty reserving the room over the internet (somehow all of the websites serving this hotel would not process my request), I called directly and was given a rate that matched the best internet price. However, I forgot to specify over the phone that I would like a non-smoking room. So I was disappointed when my room was stuffy and had a lingering smell of smoke, but can't exactly fault the hotel since I am the one who made the mistake. I opened the window (my room was on the busy street), but the airflow wasn't great. I prefer a warm room, but it was approaching my upper temperature threshold. The room itself was small but well-equipped. There were a few holes in the walls from pictures long-since removed, and some areas with peeling wallpaper. However, the room was immaculate. The kettle was clean, there was tea as well as coffee (including creamers and sugar), and the closet was large enough to hang my jacket and store my luggage (the size of a backpack). For those people who say the closet is a joke, I merely wonder what they had planned to store in there. The bathroom was the most impressive feature of the room, as it truly was spotless and quite spacious. On the old side, yes, but incredibly clean (I'd almost say sterilized if I had a cotton swab and an agar plate to confirm it). I seriously considered taking a bath because it was so inviting (but it's still a hotel room, so I passed). I did, however, soak my feet in the bath. I panicked when I couldn't turn off the water, but then tried a push-turn technique with the faucet and it seemed to work. The pull-turn technique was also useful. The toilet had a strong flush and the sink was also immaculate, so no complaints in the bathroom department. The bed was twin-sized, and had I arrived at the hotel earlier, I would have called down to reception to ask for an additional pillow. This one was rather old and I think the feathers were simply for show, as they did not act as a head prop at all. The most disturbing part of my stay was that, at about 11:30pm, an hour after I had gone to bed, I heard a key turn the lock in my room. Luckily I had placed the bolt over the door, but it woke me and I called out that someone was in the room. A heavily accented man (with a different accent to the rest of the staff at this Malaysian hotel) ordered me to open the door, but I refused. He said he was hotel security doing the nightly check, and that I was not supposed to be there. I told him that I would not open the door under any circumstances, and to have the front desk call up to me if they wanted me to vacate the room. He assured me that he did work for the hotel, but I didn't budge. The next morning, I did confirm that he was a staff member, and the day manager apologized profusely, saying that the evening staff forgot to fill in all of the necessary check-in paperwork for me...thus resulting in confusion with the night staff. The manager also gave me a message that had been taken for me the previous afternoon but not given to me at check-in. I then went for breakfast and found tasty tea, warm croissants and the usual English breakfast fare. No complaints there. The next day was much less eventful, thank goodness, and the following morning saw another pleasant breakfast. The staff (other than a very confused night manager) were all very pleasant, the location was perfect for a first-time traveller to London, and the hotel was, I repeat, *very* clean.

Rooms are small, but very clean. Staff was more than adequate and helpful. Pillows are typically small, but when we asked for more the front desk sent them right up.

We arrived on an early morning flight and were allowed to check in. Hotel location is convenient to shopping, entertainment, dining, underground, and Hyde Park.

I was mortified by some of the reviews but the room was booked and paid for already. When we arrived the twin room we were given was far too small and the hotel was nice enough to give us a better, larger room at no additional charge. There didn't seem to be an excessive amount of smoking in the lobby, the hot water was adequate, but I'd say they need to remodel the rooms and the bathrooms. The location is just great, short walk to Bayswater Underground station, few minutes to Hyde Park and Portabello Road. Honestly, I would not stay here again but all in all not an awful hotel.
