My wife and I had a room on the 4th foor overlooking the pool and garden. My son and 2 grandsons had a room with kitchnette to be able to cook meals. Our room came equipped with a mini fridge and an LCD TV, dishes, cutlery and an electric kettle for tea or coffee. If you want a hairdryer just ask for it at the desk. Internet is available in the room for a fee but not worth it. System too slow and at times couldn't connect at all. Had to ask for money back for the last day. Present system will be soon be replaced by the more efficient Accor wi-fi system, I was told. Friendlly staff with reasonable English. Polite with helpful suggestions on using the bus or metro system and getting around Rome. To get from Ciampino airport to the hotel I used http://www.airportconnection.it/ and reserved their services online. Efficient, reliable and cheaper than the service provided by the hotel: 65 euros for 5 people and luggage. The hotel charges 75 euros. Down side: If you stay longer than 3 nights, rooms are not cleaned nor are towels changed, unless you ask for it and pay an extra fee. We had to take down the garbage to the cellar. They also ask you to recycle but bags are not provided. Location was also a problem. Even though the hotel was close various bus halts to visit Rome, it was far enough from the center to make coming back to it during the day for a rest quite impractical. That being said, I would recommend this hotel to families who want to cook some of their meals and save on food and also to those who do not have walking issues.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chaves, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cQuality for the price\u201d", "Author": "tpilomia", "ReviewID": "UR127033991", "Content": "We stayed in the Adagio for four nights and were quite happy with the establishment. The location is in a residential area on a quiet no exit street, almost a private lane. It is surrounded by trees and the hotel itself has extensive gardens. We took the normal room without cooking facilities, but even this had a small fridge, dishes, and cutlery. The floors are imitation wood with no carpets giving an appearance of cleanliness. The room was spacious and opened on to a good size balcony overlooking the garden and pool. The bathroom was modern with a good shower and plenty of hot water. The television had all the Italian channels and included CNN, Sky, BBC, and even a Spanish and Portuguese channel. There was no cleaning of the room, but this was not a problem for us. I actually preferred to have no stranger coming in the room, and felt safe leaving my passport behind during the day. I can't speak about the breakfast since we always had ours at a cafe on the Piazza Pio XI, but the restaurant in the hotel grounds serves very good food at reasonable prices. In the lobby of the hotel there is a snacks machine with cold drinks, crisps, and chocolates, all at almost supermarket prices. The only negative thing in our sojourn was the WI Fi, which even though paying 3 euros to use was practically worthless. We would often wait thirty minutes just for it to open, and this counted in our internet time. We complained but to no avail. Apparently it is an old problem, with everyone complaining, but the hotel still charging. At the reception desk everyone spoke reasonable English and was very helpful. As far as location is concerned, there is a five minute walk down the Via Leone Dehon, turning left onto Via Leone XIII, to the Piazza Pio XI, which is really only a giant intersection of the Via Gregorio VII and the Via Anastasio II. There you can find a very good cafe for your morning capucino and croissants (only one euro for a latte and .80 for a croissant), a pharmacy, several restaurants, a pastry shop called the Pasticceria Siciliana Svizzera, a bank, and most importantly a large supermarket where you can buy your salad or pasta to take back to the room. Most importantly, all the bus stops to take you either down Via Gregorio VII to the Vatican or down Via Anastasio II to the Valle Aurelia metro station can be found here. I recommend the daily pass costing 4 euros, which you only punch in on your first trip. You can buy either single tickets or the daily pass at a small Tabaccharia next to the supermarket, where the owner speaks excellent English. The area around the hotel is not interesting for walking, but I did walk to the nearby Villa Doria Pamphili Park, about ten minutes away from the hotel. Unfortunately, as can happen often in Rome, the sidewalk stops at a major highway, the Via Aurelia Antica, and you must risk your life to run through the fast moving cars and motorcyles. Somebody forget the zebra crossing. Oops! The park itself is enormous and looked like a beautiful area for a future visit. All in all, I would recommend this hotel if you want a quiet street and don't mind taking buses to get to the major tourist sites. If you are able to book early and get a good price then it is an extra plus.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vila Real", "Title": "\u201cA cheap and relaxing place to stay in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Pilombeta", "ReviewID": "UR127015169", "Content": "I stayed with my sons the last week of March at the Adagio Dehon in an apartment.

During the 10 days room was cleaned once as we knew but there waa never enough toilet paper. When I phoned front desk for some, they refused to send it up and I hd to go to lobby to get it. The fridge had no ice tray and when we asked front desk for ice they sent us to hotel restaurant. They gave us ice with hesitation and said they won't give it again. When I had phoned for the cost and asked if there was Internet they said it's pay wifi but free wifi in lobby. This was a LIE. Lobby has one computer with Internet for use which was always being used. This is not what wifi is. The staff need to learn the definition of wifi.

The hotel itself is clean, have a couple of options for low and high cost apartments (If I remember correctly from 100 to 140 Euro per night). Apartment are large clean and have nice bathrooms and a small kitchenette and refrigerator stacked in a cupboard. The pool is nice but is too short for real swimming. still it is refreshing. The restaurant outside is a nice addition. we did not check their lunch or dinner but the breakfast that may come with you order (or pay 6 Euro) is not something I recommend. You are better off finding a small Italian bar for coffee and sandwich or make your own at the kitchenette. The stuff is cordial and helpful and tries to make your stay as smooth as possible. Even though our room was not what we expected they change it for a higher floor, double bed room and allow me to freely park my scooter in their indoor parking. Some warnings: 1. Try and order directly. 2. Choose the exact location of the room - preferably looking into the main garden at the second floor or higher (the lower apartments face the entrance or a dense shrubbery and might be dark) 3.Choose a room with double bed in advance. 4.Cleaning is automatic only for a stay of a week and above. If this is important to you, make the arrangement in advance. 5. have some transportation to the city ( I chose a scooter which is great if you are a motorcyclist and have no fear). The hotel is a bit far from the center of town. 6. Kitchenette has all the facilities but no basic elements for cooking (oil, sugar etc.) make sure to get them at the local store. 7. Wi-Fi is useless - work only in the public area for a cost. In all, a nice option for a relaxed a bit off center apartment hotel.

This is a great place away from the hustle and bustle of the city. If you are looking for a little oasis then this is the place for you. It is about a 15-20 min walk from Vatican City. We mainly used the public transportation to get around (which was a little annoying as there seems to be sooo many buses and it was very, very hot on them!). We had trouble finding the place on our first day - we could not find any clear directions (my own fault, should have called the hotel). You can take the metro line A to Valle Aurelia then take bus #31. The directions I found told me that you got off the bus after 3 stops but this was incorrect. I am not going to estimate the number as I never counted but once you see the Esso to the left side get off. Walk up the road the Esso is on (this is Via Leone XIII) and turn right on Via Leone Dehon (the hotel is marked from here). The walk from the bus is a good 5 minutes half of it up hill which was a bit tiresome after a long day of touring. Also pay attention to the times the bus runs! We were told to take #571 to the colosseum (we were going for dinner) but were not told that the bus stops running early evening (like 7:30pm) and were stuck finding a different way back to the hotel. The hotel itself is nice. The poolside garden area is lovely and would have been great for a swim (we were too busy touring). The rooms are well equipped. It seems some of the rooms are undergoing renos (no worries about noise or anything while we were there) and some of the rooms seem to need it. The first room we were shown to looked quite well used with old, stained carpet that didn't appear to be well cleaned (although we were told it was, it was just old) and the dishes in the kitchenette were dirty. We weren't happy and asked for a new room (this was a first - I hate complaining and have never asked for another room before). Although they were \"fully booked\" they made arrangements and moved us down the hall to another room that we think was in the process of being reno'd. It had new flooring and the kitchenette was spotless. Much better (but to my defense when I had booked the room I had requested a room overlooking the pool on the upper level as I knew from other reviews that these rooms had been redone - was not given that!). We bought food for our own breakfast (the hotel charges 6 euro/person). The bathroom was without hairdryer but you can get one from the front desk (you need to leave a deposit but get it back once you return the dryer). Overall it was a good stay. The staff is overall friendly and helpful. If you are pressed for time you may want to consider staying closer to the centre. If you are looking for a little R and R while staying in Rome then this may be the place for you.", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holb\u00e6k", "Title": "\u201cSuperb\u201d", "Author": "Iver1986", "ReviewID": "UR15464965", "Content": "Highly recommend hotel...

The air conditioning works properly, the rooms really are soundproof rather than just claiming to be, and the quiet location means that outside noise isn't a problem anyway. The foyer is great, with some very nice paintings on the walls. Nice gardens and swimming pool too. The breakfast is fine. The staff were friendly and the information about getting into the city centre and Vatican was great. The uphill walk back from the bus stop (5 minutes or so) in the heat was a little irritating, but if you're right on top of things then noise starts to be an issue.
