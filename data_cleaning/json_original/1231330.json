I didn't like the location at all, i spent alot on taxis that barely knew the Hotel. CONS: -no free wifi , you have to pay a ridiculous amount of Dirhams to get a 24hr access to net. - no business centers, so you cant even do a quick email check or fax or anything. - staff kept me waiting an hour for check in, but they apologized for it. - the sofa bed was impossible to sleep on, so don't depend on it at all, rates for an extra bed is expensive. - reception does get busy to a point they wont answer your help calls, its just annoying not so important. - I never used the pool because no one showed me where it is. - if your room is on the street side it will get noisy by cars passing by, so i recommend you to request a room away from the noisy street, PROS: -I'm an architect, and i say the interior design was 4.2/5 alot of space and good quality finishing, nice furniture and functionality. - all accessorizes were working great e.g. the fridge, washing machine, LCD TV's. - Room cleaning service was fast and basic, they make sure you get what you want. - Ordering food from outside is possible just ask for the MFC menu. - A good place to stay for couples. Must improve: The sofa bed and Internet access come on we are in 2012.

The apartments are very spacious and the beds very comfortable. We had a nice balcony and the apartments are fully equiped with everything you should need. There are also many shops near the hotel for foodstuffs and the mall is easily walked to over the winter months. The hotel is also extremely close to the metro with which you can get around Dubai easily or taxis are easily come by. Taxi drivers in Dubai though to us seem rude and they drive very badly, they are also unwilling to take you short distances, but surely that's still their job?! We much preferred the metro as our source of travel and it is much cheaper than the taxis anyhow. Dubai taxis can be very expensive. After one of our friends left there was only two of us so we moved to a twin studio room, these rooms still have eveything that you need but are smaller. Unfortunately though, there was a horrible smell coming from the drains at night, but the hotel did say they would look into that after we left. Overall therefore, this hotel is great value for money. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the pool on the roof is great along with a small gym. The staff on the front desk are friendly and helpful and the concierge also. We would like to mention Lyndon on the front desk, he helped us with the change of room and a late check out and he was always friendly, smiley and welcoming to us. We were very surprised at how hard he works, he never seemed to have a break and some days he was there 12-14 hours, always with a smile! Well done! We would also like to mention Ronald from the concierge. He again was always smiley, friendly and extremely helpful, he showed us rooms as we requested, helped store our luggage and was always welcoming with a little compliment or other which made us smile. He even noticed us walking one day whilst he was off duty and stopped for a chat! Really excellent staff. Downsides to this hotel: the internet is not included, the tv channels are very bad and there was no dvd player in the apartments. It was also very noisy and some nights we would have to call down to reception to mention that we were being kept awake by parties and voices etc. The housekeeping staff were also a little slow, some days not cleaning our room until 3 or 4pm. There was also a bad drain smell in room 502. We also thought the swimming pool would be better if only a little of it was covered, not the whole thing. However, we would definately stay here again and we would reccomend this hotel as a good value stay in Dubai.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, Comfortable & Good Value\u201d", "Author": "LWCLondon", "ReviewID": "UR125013703", "Content": "I spent 4 nights at the Coral Al Khoory Hotel Apartments and although a bit isolated (near to Mall of Emirates - but not walkable - nothing much is) , it was central enough to get a cab and get around Dubai - although Dubai Cabs are expensive for what they are.

It was quite good value for money but there was a little lack of knowledge in the central reservation staff.More on that later.

The bell desk staff were extremely helpful and only too ready to hail a taxi or bring the bags up etc. There is grocery store just round the corner which sold basic grocery items. The Mall of Emirates was within walking distance, but with the heat being what it is, we would only take a cab to get there. It was easy enough to get a cab with only a couple of minutes wait. The decor was very typical of the region but it was basic and clean. Now on to my peeves. In this day of the internet, it is hard to manage without being constantly in touch with the world. My husband had business to attend to as well. To make sure, I called their central reservations to check if there had wireless connectivity in the rooms or if it was via a wire. They specifically told me that they had WiFi in the room. Only after that did we bring the ipad instead of a regular laptop. After checking in we were informed that there was no wireless in the room. It was quite disappointing. Secondly, we had requested for a late check out while making the reservation itself, but that instruction was also not passed down. Even after reconfirming this on check in, they did not make a note of this and on the day of check out, it ended being a small issue which was resolved quite easily but an issue nonetheless.

You can see the Mall of the Emirates' (ski slope) from the balcony (which you needed to get a key from the reception desk to open) or from the roof. The mall was a short 5 -10 minute walk away. The roof pool was fabulous; large and warm with views, a sun sail and a lifeguard. There is a separate children's pool area (beware of slightly sharp tiles when sitting on the walls), towels and a few loungers with shades. It was never busy when we were there. The appartment was a 3 bedroom affair on the top floor, it was very large with a sitting room, TV kitchen, iron and ironing board, fridge, washing machine, loads of storage, three toilets and two bathrooms. Beds were comfy and no noise, very slightly jaded round the edges but nothing major and clean, we were very happy with it. Apart from the Mall of the Emirates you would need a taxi (or bus tour) to get around. (There is also the train / metro at the mall), however, taxis are cheap. Hail them from the street it is the cheapest way. From the airport expect a 30 minute ride or so and it will cost you about 75 Dirham (plus tip). The beach and a number of other areas cost around \u00a35 (30 Dirham) for five of us. In that sense the location is not perfect but it is relatively close to everything so it is a good location and getting about is easy. We took an open top bus tour which was about \u00a340 each but it took all day and went everywhere, I would fully recommend this for day 1. Get it from the Mall of the Emirates on the ground floor near the Carrefour entrance There are some minimarkets in very close proximity for milk, water, cheese. breads, cornflakes etc, you won't need to pay expensive breakfast prices as you have a kitchen. The restauant looked nice and cklean and bright but we didn't use it. The one negative was about the staff. When you saw them, they greeted you etc they were great (one lady particularly helpful) and friendly, however, we rang down for a few things, 'please open the patio door', 'needed another towel', 'broken clothes horse' etc. On the first occasion we had to ring again after an hour and on the last occasion they simply never came! Overall, liked it a lot, good value \u00a3480 for 3 nights for 5 people, good quality like a home from home.

Although the water drainage had a little problem in the bathtub the last couple of days. But nothing major. Also, there was no DVD player in our room. Our room was cleaned by housekeeping everyday and all our dirty dishes were washed every morning. The only thing that was annoying was that every morning housekeeping would ring the doorbell to ask what time to come and clean up! One thing we forgot to do was to hang the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign at night, but all the same, they should just wait for the \"Please Clean My Room \" sign instead of ringing the doorbell !!!! The view from the hotel was nothing special. The hotel was walking distance from the Mall of Emirates. It took between 7 to 10 minutes to get there. However we did take a cab a few times since it was hot or late at night. Taxi to the mall was less than10 Dirhams but we would always round it up and pay the driver 10. The Metro station was in the Mall of Emirates so it was quite convenient for us to get to Dubai Mall or other places. A silver card for the Metro was 20 Dirhams, which has 14 Dirhams credit on it. It could be used for both the Metro and Buses. I would recommend this hotel apartment to friends since it was quite good for the price you pay.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "estartit", "Title": "\u201cWhy stay in a hotel?\u201d", "Author": "billym", "ReviewID": "UR59428283", "Content": "We stayed for 8 nights in a 1 bedroom apartment and will definitely return on our next visit to Dubai.Large spacious apartment with independent kitchen , large batheoom and separate toilel.Equipped for two persons so 'invite any guests!

It's located right by the Mall of Emirates, 10 minute drive to the Burj Al Arab (most luxurious hotel in the world), 15 minute drive to Jumeirah Beach and Burj Khalifa (tallest building in the world). Chose this place because it was one of the lowest priced for the location. Wasnt expecting much, but it was EXCELLENT. It seems like its brand new. Huge apartment with wood floors, travertine bathrooms. Big kitchen with washer/dryer. Right next door is a very cheap pakisani restaurant open till midnight. Around the corner is a supermarket, which helps save money because we would buy milk/cereal and keep it in the apartment for breakfast. Staff is very nice and helpful. I've travelled the world and stated at 5 star hotels, and even cheap 2 star motels. If I didnt read up on this place before hand and just showed up, I would assume it was 4 stars and probobly very expensive to stay.......and the best part is it was very reasonable priced for all the quality and location and amenities (full kitchen with dishes, daily cleaning, very nice rooftop pool with a view, gym ).

So if you are in Dubai for a shopping trip this location is great, also because you can catch the metro from the Mall of the Emirates to travel to the next station to the biggest mall - the Dubai Mall, which again is next to the tallest building in the world: the Burj Dubai (also known as Burj Khalifa). Although close to Sheikh Zayed Road, the main artery of the city, the hotel is quiet. We stayed in a junior suite, which had a kitchen and bathroom. Very comfortable rooms and modern decor.

The staff are your typical Yes Sir, Yes Ma'am sort of robotic types who were friendly enough, but unable to multi -task and check in took ages. During my stay I actually witnessed and argument between 2 of the staff which was quite very unprofessional. It also seemed like the Arabic guests got priority a better service than I did being a Western Male. The pool is new but fairly small. There are a lot of screaming children which made it difficult to read and relax. They gym is pretty basic and all in all everything is quite clean.
