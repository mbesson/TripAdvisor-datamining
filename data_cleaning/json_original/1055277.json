The staff was extremely friendly and helpful as far as tourism,transportation etc. Additionally the staff presented a warm welcoming attitude by showing sincere concern with your level of comfort. Next aspect, i was impressed with was the setting of this hotel. It was very modern and each room offered it's own distinct character. the art work was simple but very decorative. The rooms were small but sufficient, and the cover was soft, thick and clean. In addition with the above, the hotel was in a great location. it was very close walking distance to public transportation(Metro). Also there were plenty restaurants near if one did not fell like traveling far. The room also has refrigerators which is extremely convenient since there is a store across the street from this great hotel.

With reasonable sized, well kept rooms, clean towels on tap, and if you're lucky enough to be in a ground floor room, a proper coffee machine thrown in, this place is hard to beat. There are some good eateries within walking distance too (particularly La Cantine du Troquet) as well as some nice Boulangeries to call into for breakfast. From our experience the staff were amazing, with nothing being too much trouble, even trying to help us book venues to eat in before we'd arrived and helping us with our 'pronunciation' and other challenges.

I really don't know about the other visitors, but for us,Paris was a fantastic experience. Right from the people helping us to get around Paris, they were more than willing to explain the route in their fluent french and somewhat broken english. We never felt unwelcome, rather it reminded me of India where people sometimes go out of their way to help. Coming back to the hotel review, the front desk is simply one of the best I have seen across all hotels I have ever visited. Alex(whom I did not meet in person, but was very helpful during online queries), Adrian and Sua(i hope i got his name right) were extremely helpful. Sua spent a good 20 mins explaining the entire route to get to the Eiffel and nearby attractions. His suggestion to check out the river cruise and the sparkling Eiffel at night meant that a good trip turned into a fantastic one(the hourly sparkling lights is a sight to behold, my girlfriend was dancing with delight :)). We thoroughly enjoyed the Metro travel, interacting with various people and visiting the sights. Sua also made sure that we got a nice room named the \"French Romance\" ;) Although the room isn't that big(compared to European hotels, it's big), it was well maintained with very comfy beds and a wonderful bathroom(with a Bathtub). The lighting was sensuous and was quite pleasing :) There is a nice view to the street and the big windows are an added bonus. Breakfast in the morning is your regular fare, with a continental breakfast for 10 Euros. This includes coffee and other beverages. It was quite decent but you need to arrive early since items out of stock don't get replenished(we missed out on the chocolate bread). The hotel is located in a very nice neighbourhood, with lots of eating options(Le Fabe doesn't have a regular restaurant-they serve only Breakfast)ranging from regular Bistros, to roadside cafes, a vegetarian restaurant(!!) and a few pizzerias. The commute to central Paris is 2 stops away,from Pernety to Montparnesse and a line change to Bir-Hakeim(the Eiffel station) and very convenient.

We walked in from the biting cold and our host, Alexandre, prepared for us a wonderful hot beverage. He gave us important tourist information and helpful tips we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. I suspect Alexandre is a major reason this hotel has received awards and accolades. Our room was small by Canadian standards, but oh so spotlessly clean and comfortable. The bed was a bit hard for my liking, but my daughter loved it, so it's a question of taste. There was plenty of hot water and the shower was fantastic. I thought the water would smell and taste horrible, but I was wrong; the water must be filtered or treated because it was as good as my well-water here at home.

In addition, the room was far too nosiy: the windows are very poorly soundproofed and we were woken at 5am by the sound of traffic outside. There's also no air con so the room was very stuffy at night.

This is at a secure underground car park which is about 1 minutes walk from the hotel so I would also recommend this if you're driving. The hotel offers a buffet breakfast for 10 Euros per person which again for Paris is very reasonable. There was a selection of pastries, toast, cereal, fruit, ham, cheese hot drinks and juice which were all well stocked and replenished if running low.

There is apparently a bus that goes straight from this airport, and an equivelant from the other airports, that takes around 45mins and costs around 17 euros that takes you almost directly to the hotel, which would have been more convenient for us with our heavy cases. We usually have a lower budget for hotels when we travel as we don't often spend too much time in them, but as this was the infamous City of Love we decided to spend that little bit extra for something a bit special. The hotel was beautifully decorated and our room was the Orchid on the third floor. We found it a little smaller than expected but perfectly equipped with all the standard things you'd expect such as mini fridge etc but also a safe which we found useful. We were suprised at no pay-per-views on the TV but when we mentioned this to the concierge he said they were being replaced next week for this very reason. There was a basement sauna available free of charge but we didn't use it, we did however use their computer and internet in the basement and although this ran slowly it was adequete, you need to ask for a password at reception. The morning breakfast was great value for money as it was a 10 euro buffet which was good value in contrast with what was available at all restaurants and cafes we found in the area. Room service only had drinks and we felt that even basic food items would have been desirable. However, the real star quality about this hotel is their wonderful concierge Alex. He was consistently helpful and welcoming, gave us lots of help with directions and even advised us where to go on our second day, a real winner as we were undecided and it ended up being the highlight of the trip. His English was exceptional as was his high level of customer service and attention. I would recommed going to this hotel simply on the basis that the staff were outstanding, the bedrooms were scrupulously changed everyday and if you're not familiar with Paris then it's a real comfort to know you have a native speaker looking out for you with genuine concern.

On another night, we had a delicious meal at a Japanese restaurant for around 12 Euro's each. We would recommend this hotel to anyone. Don't be put off by comments about the location on the Metro line. We used the Metro to get around quite a lot and it was no inconvenience to have to go on another couple of stops on the M13 line to the hotel and it was nice to be situated in a slightly quieter area. The walls are fairly thin at Le Fabe but we had fire doors just outside our room closed at night time which helped reduce any noises from the stairs and other rooms and we had undisturbed sleeps in a very comfortable bed.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel with excellent service\u201d", "Author": "tarryn222", "ReviewID": "UR106259913", "Content": "I stayed in le fabe hotel in paris for 2 nights, then went to dordogne for 4 nights and then another night on my return.

I booked in March 2010, asking if the hotel offered transfers from the airport. Alexandre kindly informed me that they didn't but gave me excellent directions on how to get to the hotel using the metro. In June he sent me a follow up email telling me about Yellow Van Shuttle http://www.yellowvanshuttle.com/ who did offer such a service. I was blown away that he had remembered my enquiry from 3 months before and booked my transfer the same day (GREAT service from them by the way). Due to unforseen circumstances I arrived in Paris on an earlier flight and subsequently got to the hotel at 09h40. Tired, desperately in need of a shower and a bed I prepared myself for a few hours' wait (check in is technically only from 14h00 onward). Alexandre said that they had had an early check-out and could possibly get me into my room a little earlier. Within 2 minutes I was seated at a table in their breakfast area with a steaming cup of hot chocolate and a plate of delicious pastries. Within 10 minutes, my bags had been taken up to the room and Alexandre escorted me up. I got my shower and was tucked into a heavenly comfortable bed with crisp linen by 10h30. THANK YOU SO MUCH Alexandre. You saved my life that day. The rest of my trip was amazing. The hotel staff were helpful, friendly and Le Fabe felt like home by the time I left. The room wasn't huge, but more than big enough for a solo traveller or a couple not travelling with 8 bags between them... There was always someone on duty to wish you good morning or good night and always wise counsel on best places to eat, places to visit etc. Pernety Metro Station is a 5 minute walk away and from there you can get to anywhere in Paris under a half hour. The immediate neighbourhood has everything and more you could need in terms of food: a bakery where you can get the freshest croissants and pain au chocolat's in the world, a cheese shop, wine shop, butchery and green grocer as well as 2 convenience stores and a chemist within walking distance if you forgot anything at home. A friend came to visit over a weekend and we got everything for a magnificent picnic within 2 blocks of the hotel. There is also a laundromat down the street, so you don't need to pack too much as you can just slip out for a quick hour/ two to do some laundry. I would highly recommend this jewel of a hotel.

The rooms are small but decorated to a high standard, absolutly perfect for a few nights stay to explore Paris. The bathroom is brand new and beautiful. We stayed in the room 'Desir', it was really good value for Paris. On our stay we visited Champs Elysee for the Christmas markets and Arch di Triomph. Eurodisney was also a great day with a lovely Christmas atmosphere. We had breakfast and hot chocolate at the famous Angelina's, ate Macroons from the master Pierre Herme and visited the Louvre. The Eiffel is a must-see more so in the evening when lit up, the restaurant on the 1st floor called Tour 58 was delicious, our best meal in Paris. The night cruise along the river seine was also spectacular. We celebrated my husband's 30th birthday in Paris and enjoyed every minute, staying at Le Fabe hotel made it perfect. A fantastic boutique hotel, lovely staff, stunning rooms in the best location to see this wonderful city - especially at Christmas!

Having previously read reviews on Trip Advisor we felt that this was affordable and attractive looking and we wasnt let down. We had a ridiculously early Easyjet flight so I was worried we wouldnt be able to check in for hours once we arrived. Thankfully the kind man on reception said he'd do his best to get us into our room asap and offered us some hot drinks whilst we waited. In the end we only had to wait 45minutes and our room was ready and he told us that he had upgraded us which was nice! The hotel itself is small and charming. Each room has it's own name. Ours was called \"Together\" which we loved. The rooms are just gorgeous too, really nicely decorated and well put together. Our room wasnt huge but just a decent size for the time we were there. We loved the bathroom, it was so modern, clean and felt really new. Everything worked brilliantly too which was a bonus! The only downside was that we just had a view of a building and the road below but because of the location I wasnt expecting to be able to see the Eiffel Tower from where we were. Overall we really loved it and it just felt very individual and romantic. The location wasnt a massive problem for us as we just used the metro and did explore some of the local area. When we were really tired and fed up with walking it then felt like an inconvenience to us! But it was by no means a deal breaker for us. Having never been to Paris before I soon realised that actually it' s a very large city and not really the kind of place you can walk round the whole of. It took us a while to grasp the Metro but we soon got the hang of it and got our bearings. I am the kind of person who loves to stay central and be walking distance to everything so for me this was one thing that we were compromising on but I totally understood that a hotel of this quality based centrally would have cost us a fortune. The hotel charges 10 Euros per person for breakfast which we didnt take part in. When we had to wait for our room in the dining area we could see the breakfast looked nice but pretty basic - breads, jams, cereals, juices, coffee, tea etc. We felt it was better to get out in the city and sample some different Cafe's than just eat in the hotel but on reflection this was probably good value for breakfast as everywhere we ate was SO expensive. The highlights of our trip were.... The Eiffel Tower - I took some convincing to go to the top but i'm glad I did. The view was pretty impressive. Also not bad value at 13 Euros each. Parisians Bateaux Dinner Cruise - If you are going to Paris for the romance and general sightseeing I would really reccomend this company. When we booked our trip we didnt know much about them and wasnt sure if it would be value for money being quite expensive but it was worth every penny. We booked in advance online for an evening dinner cruise which lasted 1 hour and a half - 2hours at 65 Euros each. Included in this was a 3 course meal and the food was lovely! The best meal we had whilst there. We also were given 2 bottles of wine, one white, one red, and a bottle of water. Our bread basket was continually replenished also. We loved it! So nice seeing the tower lit up at night and such a nice vibe on the boat once it set off. There was a more expensive option which included champagne, a larger boat and live music and we said that night that if we had known it was going to be that good we would have gone for the more expensive trip. Definately worth doing! Our other highlight were the Luxembourg Gardens. It was such nice weather when we visited here and it just looked stunning and so relaxing. It was nice to take time out from all the walking to actually just sit, have an ice cream and enjoy the surroundings. This is actually walking distance from the hotel too.

The hotel is not in the middle of all the sights and touristy places which obviously makes it better value but maybe for first timers to Paris less ideal if you do not enjoy walking or using the subway much. We went jogging to Jardin du Luxemburg every morning which is about 1km away from the hotel and enjoyed running in this beautiful parc with other locals. Close are Saint Germain des Pres with great shops and markets, the Sorbonne and Quartier Latin plus the Tour de Montparnasse. The hotel has a great little sauna in the basement with a shower and extra towels where you can book a session 30 mins in advance to relax after sight seeing. Only two cons: It was a little loud at night as the local juveniles practised their motorbike skills for hours but then we left the window open and I doubt it will be more quiet anywere else in Paris.

Generally the pictures of hotels are always nicer than the actual rooms, but these pictures were spot on. Everything looked clean and well-kept, including the bathroom. The room had an espresso machine to make hot drinks. The worst part of our short stay there was also what made me appreciate this hotel the most. The hotel had helped us arrange a shuttle to the airport, but this shuttle was cancelled at the last minute (not the hotel's fault, they work with a company that offers the service). However, the two hotel staff who helped us deal with this situation were incredibly helpful. They worked very hard to find us a way to the airport (finally we took an Air France bus), and we made it in time even though our flight ended up being delayed. :) So I heartily recommend this hotel and I believe it's worth the price.

Once we settled in the room, which was spacious, with a gorgeous bathroom, we had found a bottle of champagne that was chilled with a handwritten \"congrats on your marriage\" note from alex. What a great touch! Alex spoke English really well and gave us many recommendations for getting around and where to go. Even though the other reception staff didn't speak english as well, they were able to help us with any questions we had for getting to many places. They were very knowledgeable. We loved the area. The metro was only a few blocks away-less than a 10 minute walk-and was a great line as it got us to most places really quickly with only a few line changes. The bakeries down the street were amazing and reasonably priced. A large baguette for one euro? YES please! We felt the area was safe and one night we walked to the area close to the bus station and found a busy nightlife street that had a hookah bar that we thoroughly enjoyed. I wish i could remember the street name but it was a straight 15 minute walk down rue de l'ouest. Our one regret was that we only stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We changed over to a hotel near the moulin rouge and were sorry we did as soon as we arrived. Le Fabe felt like home-the beds were so comfortable we had a hard time waking up (we had them set up 2 wake up calls per morning for us!). We loved the staff and the pernety area. The business center was nice since we did not bring our computer. Overall, our stay was wonderful and we were sad to leave. When we return to Paris we will definitely be staying at this hotel again.

Luckily we brought our own cable and was able to get Internet access from the wall, but the speed was slow. - Poor location. The area looks okay during the day, but come night time, it was a bit scary. Drunks and homeless people on the streets and most stores closed. We also stayed in the Moulin Rouge area during our Paris trip, and stores there close much later than this area. - We spoke to one other employee when Alex wasn't around (didn't catch his name), he tried his best, but his English just wasn't very good. - The double bed was just two single beds put together. My girlfriend kept falling into the crack between the beds. Overall, this is just an extremely overpriced hotel. Don't make the mistake we made.

First, the hotel is a great value: in a city where one can easily spend 200 to 300 Euros per night on an average hotel, the rates at the beautifully decorated and very well-maintained Fabe were very reasonable. The location was very close to the Metro (Pernety station), from which we found that we could easily get to all the sites of Paris. The Fabe is located in the Montparnasse area which isn't a touristic neighbourhood, but we felt this was a bonus. We generally tried restaurants and bakeries near the hotel. Since they were away from the tourist core, they were more reasonably priced (e.g., a croissant in the touristy areas of Paris would cost 2 to 3 times as much and the boulangeries or bakeries near the Fabe). The quality of food nearby was terrific too! The front desk staff were very helpful when asking about dining options and were very helpful with all questions about Paris. When it came to traveling around Paris, we used the excellent and efficient Metro system to get everywhere. A previous reviewer noted the size of the rooms. Perhaps this reviewer has never been to Paris, but most hotel rooms in the city are considerably smaller than those in North America. We found the size of the room to be standard sized for Paris and the bathroom was very lovely. The bed was very comfortable (another thing: often beds in France can be much harder than beds in N. America -- we found our bed at the Fabe to be very comfortable). There is some noise from the street below, but I imagine this is the case anywhere in Paris... the street isn't particularly loud, but Paris is like NY in that there are always people up and about. Bring earplugs if you need absolute quiet to sleep -- I slept quite restfully without any! The publicly accessible computer was also very handy when it came to researching activities or future portions of our visit to France. I highly recommend the Fabe and would definitely consider returning in future trips to Paris. Also one big recommendation while travelling in Paris -- don't hesitate to practice some French!

La Fabe was a dream -- the concierges were very helpful and the room was soooo comfortable. My boyfriend never gets relaxed in hotels and he felt totally at home. The bed was so big and soft, and the bathroom was very spacious, and the shower was great. Wall are not soundproof: you can hear people walking around immediately outside of your door, but not conversations. The breakfast area is a little small, but its to be expected in a boutique hotel; the food was good and there was a nice variety. The metro a two block walk and there are LOTS of restaurants surrounding.

The rooms are lovely decorated, very clean and modern. The bathroom is like new. The rooms are not the biggest, but not too small either. On a city trip, you don't need a big room anyway.

(Cereals, juices, coffee/tea, different breadchoices, charcuterie, cheeses, marmelade,croissants,...) The location of this hotel might be a little bit out of the centre (in Montparnasse), but a metrostation is around the corner.
