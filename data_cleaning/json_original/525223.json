It was a bit of a pain having to go to the Hotel in order to be taken to the apartment, if I was going again I'd ask if they could meet us there. Although, it wasn't too bad as the hotel and apartment are only one tram stop apart. (If you're looking for the hotel, take the 197 bus from the airport, straight to Museumplein stop, it's really close to the hotel and saves about 50euros on a taxi). The staff were friendly and gave us a map and also had a rack of minicards we could look through for attractions' offers. Then they took us on the tram to the apartment and showed us around. The apartment was basic and a little old-fashioned, re-decorating would be nice. However, it was pretty clean, not much dust, no mould in the bathroom, clean sheets etc. The living room was a decent size but the sofa was tiny. There was a table and chairs for four to eat at. And a very tiny, but working TV. No hotel comforts like a phone or hairdryer. Clean towels were provided, (3 small bath towels and two hand towels between three people). There was a double bed in the bedroom, with no room for anything else! And a single we had asked for in the living room. There wasn't a wardrobe, just a coat rack. The kitchen had everything we needed- a hob, fridge (with freezer shelf), microwave, kettle, coffee maker, pans, utensils and cutlery. The stairs leading to the apartment make it only suitable for young and/or fit people who can climb a lot of steep stairs. The location is great as you can walk to Leidseplein or Museumplein in about 10 minutes. There's also a tram stop outside if you're feeling lazy.

Rooms were clean, we had a breakfast in the room rate, which was 3 toasts, 1 egg, 1 slice of ham and cheese, one marmelade and one butter. Coffee and juice included. Not so much, but you are in the low budget hotel don't you? :) Toilets and shower in the hall for all the rooms. Showers were clean but definitelly need to repaint! Staff pleasant, show us what we need, were polite and friendly. STAIRS to the first floor - that was something! I've never seen stairs like this and hardly can imagin that I have something else exept my hand luggage with me :-) Trust me, if you have problems with your legs or knees, try to find another place.

She also told me about a supermarket that was located just down the street. She was absolutely wonderful. The only bad part about this hotel is that you have to go up 2 very steep staircases to get to your room, so if you have mobility issues or are disabled, this would not be a good hotel for you. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. I had a doule bed, sink, small desk, tv, and closet. Breakfast was brought up to your room daily and included toast, jam, a hard boiled egg, cheese, meat, orange juice, and your choice of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. Over all, I was very happy with my stay here. The hotel is in a really quiet area, which is very nice after leaving the noisy bar scene. The Leidensplein, which has a lot of bars, clubs, and restaraunts, is just a short walk away. For the most part, Amsterdam is so small, you can walk everywhere.", "Date": "April 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern England", "Title": "\u201cSmall budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "milliebell", "ReviewID": "UR3691890", "Content": "I stayed for three nights. The hotel is very small with only a few rooms. Staff spoke good English. They were friendly but could be quite abrupt at times. The rooms were clean. Mine had a shared bathroom, but it wasn't a problem. My room was very spartan and basic, but I couldn't complain for the very cheap price. Breakfast is served in your room at 8.30am - a wake up call every morning whether required or not. It was a good selection of cheese, eggs, toast, jam etc. The hotel doesn't have any other facilities - this is fine for me as I am not the type to stay in. I only needed my room to sleep in and I was out exploring the rest of the time. It is not in the centre, but tram 16 from centraalstation and a few buses stop outside, and tourist tram 20 - linking all of the major sites in Amsterdam - stops at the end of the street. The hotel is only a short walk away from the major musuems such as the Rijksmusuem and the Van Gogh musuem. This is a good quiet hotel. It is very small so you won't meet many people. Its small size means no large groups of screaming schoolkids -bliss, and it will not be suitable for stag and hen parties etc. This place really wouldn't suit romantics and honeymooners either. It also wouldn't suit those who want a resort within a hotel. For individual travellers who spend a lot of time sightseeing, looking for a very quiet but easy to reach and cheap place to stay, this is fine.", "Date": "July 22, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Bema", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d525223-Reviews-Hotel_Bema-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$95 - $218*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Concertgebouwplein 19 B</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1071 LM</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "525223", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/38/37/3837a4d6128e25f0c6f342b73d21f2ae1large.jpg"}}
