The room was rather shabby and small for a what was sold as a `deluxe` room. The bathtub was blocked. A visit to the hotel`s `hammam` was included in the price. However, when we asked to visit, it was not heated up nor was the pool filled up. Massages given by the cleaning lady would have been charged extra.

It has around 25 rooms I guess, which means you will hardly see any people. The decor is well done, yet not too expensive. Unlike a budget hotel where it is usually white-wash with basic facilities, this hotel scores better in this regard. The main desk is always manned; and the staff are well versed in English and very friendly too. The hotel has a deal with one of the local limo service provider, and hence to-and-fro services to either the main city airport (Ataturk) or the one on the outskirts (Sabiha) is economical and you don't have to break your head explaining the location to the driver. They also guide you well to tourist locations, and the ferry services and the finer details of it all. The hotel locality is a quiet area of the old city, Sultanahmet and is only a 10-15 minutes walk from major tourist areas. You can go the Sultanahmet Square, the Blue Mosque, The Basicila Cistern, The Grand Bazaar and other areas of tourist interests all on foot. There is a railway station nearby, and if you walk 10 minutes to the Sultanahmet Square, you can also get on the local tram to take you far away. The breakfast was kind of nice, and they had a good spread. The rooms aren't too huge, but sufficient enough for you store your luggage well and stretch your legs around. The room we stayed in was a double and it was clean and nice, and we also had a balcony opening to one of the crammed streets of the old city. They also provide free Wi-Fi, which is a plus if you want to reconnect with the world outside. All in all.. a good place for backpackers and/or couples looking for a quick stopover in Istanbul.

We arrived and found that the larger room we had paid for was not available so we got a smaller room with barely enough room to put our luggage on the floor and be able to walk around. After one day, we were moved to a larger, nice room. Our beds in both rooms had no top sheet and the blanket was too small for the bed. We often had to make adjustments in the middle of the night so we could share the blanket and not having a top sheet was very uncomfortable. The bottom sheet was pressed but looked soiled. This was true even after they had changed the bottom sheet (remember no top sheet). Light bulbs were out but replaced after a call. There was no stopper in the sink. Fortunately, we always carry a flat rubber stopper as we often experience leaking sinks. There was only one glass in the bathroom, in both rooms and several calls requesting an additonal glass made no difference. It was also difficult to get into the shower as it was a shower/tub combination that had very high sides. We were on a busy street so we couldn't open the windows and the air conditioning blew right on the bed area. The breakfast area was on the roof. Normally, this would be a pleasant place for breakfast but it was cold and the rain was coming in. Too bad as the breakfasts were quite nice. The internet was very good and worked in our rooms.

I have never known any hotel do this before and it caused us to be needlessly overdrawn on one of our accounts It stated clearly on the terms and conditions of booking that payment was to be made at the end of the stay.

After looking up almost every option listed in that book, I saw that Aruna (which is not featured in LP) had gotten many good reviews on Trip Advisor. I decided to take a chance and chose to stay at the Aruna, and I am glad that we did! After too many bad experiences booking hotels and flights through third party sites online, I sent an email directly to the Aruna and received a reply in a matter of minutes. After a few back-and-forth emails, I received a call from the manager and booked a room over the phone. I was even given a price discount on the Junior Suit due to a price miscommunication online...which was very gracious of them. The driver from the hotel met us at the airport and took us straight to our hotel where we were met by a very friendly staff person. Even though our room was not ready, we were allowed to change clothes and freshen up in a vacant room. Our room was not facing the street and was on the third floor (I would agree with other posters that the first floor facing the street could possibly be a bit noisy from street traffic). Our room was spotless, charming, and blissfully quiet. As far as the hotel's location, I think it is perfect. It is far enough off the beaten track that you get all of Istanbul's charm, without any of the tourist traffic or noise. It took us only 10 minutes of a very easy walk to get to the Blue Mosque. The weather in late Sept is great and we walked everywhere from our hotel, even to the Grand Bazarre. Our only mild quibble is that the terrace view is not the most spectacular around. But frankly, who spends time in a hotel when there is so much more to see? Also, breakfast selection was not the most amazing (far too many sugary cereals for my taste), but it was certainly adequate. The lobby could also be a bit cleaner. Dishes and used cups were sometimes found at the computer station and coffee table. Not a big deal, but also not the best first impression when walking into a hotel. My advice to future customers is to contact the hotel directly when trying to book a room and be sure that, if possible, you get a room not on the first floor, and facing the back of the hotel to eliminate the occasional street noise. Overall, happy that we stayed at the Aruna and would recommend it to others.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOverall good, missing a few things that would make it better.\u201d", "Author": "Abuelo", "ReviewID": "UR79258573", "Content": "We arrived midmorning on Sunday even though check in time was scheduled for the afternoon. Greeted nicely and upgraded to a suite on 3rd floor which was immediately available. Elevator holds three people. Old fashioned brass/gold lock with traditional skeleton type key. Luggage brought up. No explanation about air conditioning or tv or jacuzzi. AC is controlled by a remote but no one told us about it so I used the controls on the AC unit itself. Neat window shades controlled by beaded cord. Jacuzzi tub small and difficult for these senior citizen bones to get in and out of. Shower head is the kind that you can hang up or use as a hand shower. Never did learn how to run water in the tub except through putting the shower head down in the tub itself. Plenty of hot water. Storage was limited but sufficient for my wife. My stuff stayed in suitcase on floor. Bed was comfortable and clean. The sheet and cover ( not bed spread) were same size as the bed so that you either slept next to each other for both to be covered or one was at least partially out from under the sheet. It made for togetherness. Safe was in wardrobe, but no explanation about how to access it etc. Had both a key and a number pad. Learned how to use it by trial and error. Room was quiet overlooking an inner courtyard. In summary, the room was clean and good but the failure to explain about AC, safe, shower etc would have made it better. Breakfast was served on the terrace. Multiple bowls with a variety of cereals, dried fruits, cold cuts, good breads, olives etc. Hard boiled eggs, jams, honey, jelly, butter. various cheeses. There were pancakes (rectangular with folded ends that were essentially cold). The attendant would put them in the microwave to heat up. I made ham and cheese pannini sandwiches in the electric grill that was there for that purpose. With the number of guests and the time for breakfast from 8:00 to 10:30 according to the handwritten sign, it would have been easy for them to cook the eggs to order.That would have made the breakfast better from our standpoint. Scarfs were available to put around shoulders if it was too chilly. Orange juice(?) tasted like Kool aide. Coffee was brewed to order and was excellent.. View from the main terrace was open only about 90 degrees but looking to the Bosporus and was okay. There was an additional terrace above the main one and it had a good view but only one table and more windy. The restaurant was closed two nights without any warning or announcement. This was no doubt due to Ramadan. But still there should have been a sign downstairs to that effect or we should have been told. The meal we had there was fine. It was disappointing to walk back to the hotel, being tired, looking forward to another good meal to find out that it was closed. so better communication would have made the experience better. A good thing is that the short walk 5 - 10 minutes from the hotel up to the Blue Mosque/ Sophia etc. is uphill. So when you are tired and coming back it is down hill. The walk itself is interesting with the narrow streets, the cars passing within inches of you, the variety of shops, businesses, hotels, people etc. The street in front of the hotel was so narrow that a bus that was to pick us up for a trip to the Prince's Islands had to wait a block away. Internet access is available in lobby at no charge. Had to ask questions to understand the Turkish key board. Staff was quick to help. When it came time to print out boarding passes, the night man on duty was most helpful. The printer is at his desk, we used his computer and he did the typing with input from me. For some odd ball reason, I was never able to access my email while there but others did not have that difficulty. Staff did a good job in arranging transportation and making tour reservations. The tour to Prince's Islands was okay but overpriced. Could have done better by taking tram to ferry, ferry to big island. Price would have been a lot less. In summary, I think the cost/benefit ratio was good. Some things could have been done better, more professionally, but what was done was in a friendly accommodating manner. I have marked the blank that I would not recommend this to a friend. That is unfair. It depends so much on the friend and the expectations.

We understand the problem of making necessary renovation, but we were paying 120 euros a night, and the clerk also told the day before that the work would be completed that same day.

We always felt that we could ask for advice, or even just go to reception in the middle of the night if we wanted a chat about the city or anything (not that we did, but we certainly felt we could have). We were on the floor above reception in one of the smaller double rooms but it had plenty of space for hanging clothes and full length mirror which was a bonus. The bed was comfortable (hard, not springy) and en suite bathroom was very clean, with a good shower and lovely soap (olive oil and thyme). There was a small fridge in the wardrobe and safe deposit box there also, as well as some complementary hotel slippers. There were several choices of teas and t.v too. We didn't need it as it was autumn time, but there was also air conditioning in the room. Breakfast was served in a large room downstairs with a friendly family abience and an abundance of cold buffet choice (cereals, dried fruit, yoghurt, jams, honey, tarhini, olives, cheeses, cold meats) as well as some hot breakfast fare. However, if you ask for it, you can have fantastic fried eggs (usually 3 or 4!) or omelette and they will also make you Turkish coffee - although there is a machine on the buffet for guests to make their own espressos etc. The hotel is located in an area perfect for exploring Sultanahmet (the streets are cobbold in much of that area so high heels would be a nightmare), and for catching the tram to the other side of the Golden Horn - although we walked it. It is tucked just far enough away from the nearby touristic resturant area to be very quiet, at the same time near enough just to pop out in the evening if you wanted a short jaunt. There is a roof tarrace that looks right out over the sea of Marmara one way - fantasic at 6am to watch the sun rise over the mountains beyond - and up the hill to the Blue Mosque and Sophia the other way. (There is a lift to all floors including the terrace) There is a call to prayer from the nearby Blue Mosque (and others) at about 5.30 which is incredibly atmospheric, and beautiful but earplugs were useful to ensure unbroken sleep. Probably what we liked the best was the feeling that everyone who worked there enjoyed doing their job and wanted the guests to have an enjoyable relaxed time. Well done. We would definately recommend it to others who want a quiet comfortable hotel, and we definately want to go back.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon, US", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good value, great breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "CarlA47", "ReviewID": "UR49599816", "Content": "Excellent value.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by Yilmaz, the manager. He took the time to sit down with us to get to know us a little better, find out what we were interested in doing and seeing during our short stay, and answer all of our questions about the area and attractions. I have to add that Yilmaz came across as very genuine and sincerely interested in informing us of all that the city has to offer a visitor. We arrived to the hotel early before check-in time so the staff placed our luggage in a secure room while we went out to see some of the sights. When we got back a few hours later, we were pleasantly surprised to find that Yilmaz had upgraded us from a deluxe double room to a suite, free of charge. I believe the suite we had is pictured on the hotel website (first two pictures from the left under the title \"Aruna Suite\"). The room was clean and equipped with a flatscreen TV, heater, AC with remote control, and a stocked-up mini-fridge. The room also had a safe but I couldn't seem to get it to work. When I asked downstairs, they told me I would be able to lock and unlock it using the extra key provided with the room key. I tried with the extra key, still no luck. However, this was not a real issue for us. The bed was made each day, fresh towels provided. Breakfast was great for us. They always had eggs, pastries, some type of meat, various kinds of cereal, bread, cheeses, cold cuts, juices, milk, and ALL kinds of fruit spreads. They also had this thing called halva, it's like a sugary cocoa spread, similar to Lebanese halawa. Oh, and they had an espresso machine. The area was quiet and safe; ten minutes away from Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, and Topkapi Palace; and near a number of restaurants...basically, all the praises mentioned in past reviews about the location are true. Also, one fact I didn't see mentioned in past reviews is that the hotel is situated about two and a half blocks away from the sea. If you're facing the hotel, turn right and walk straight until you pass another hotel and come across the first road that turns right. When you turn right, you'll come across the main road that borders the old area and the sea. Yilmaz made some recommendations for restaurants which turned out to be good and even got us in contact with some people he knew when we mentioned an interest in shopping for local leather goods. What also made this a great experience for us was the little details like when we were lent an umbrella when we weren't properly equipped for the weather. In short, we were extremely pleased with the hotel, staff, and approach to service and hospitality.

The size of the room was great and we enjoyed our own TV area. AC worked well and most importantly the room was quiet. - whilst the room is furnished nicely, on closer inspection, we actually found it to be quite worn - light bulbs didn't work, wall paper falling away, attempts to paint over certain areas but not finished properly. hot water was not consistent. not really what you expect for \u00c2\u00a3130 a night. - breakfasts are ok. on first inspection, you think it looks great. but the hot selection is poor and gives the impression that it's been standing for a long time. pastries don't seem fresh enough either. but the general selection of foods on offer, ranging from cerels, cheese, cold meats etc. is good. we did enjoy Abdullah's company at breakfast but after the 4th day of hearing the same jokes to other guests, including his attempts at getting people to speak basic Turkish, it got a bit tiresome to be honest. but i appreciate that some people will at the same time love it. - location is ok. it's in a very safe area and all the main sights are nearby. tram is about a 10 minute walk. however, restaurants in the area are generally fairly average. the best area is Istiklal / Galata - some great places. but it's a long-ish journey on the tram to get there, particularly at the end of the night.

As we were three we had booked an extra bed, the hotel offered us the suite at no extra charge so we would have extra space which was good as from the twin room I saw it would have been a bit too cosy for 5 nights. The fold up bed wasn't great but to the hotel's credit they offered us an adjoining room at no extra charge if we wanted it. The staff were very helpful with all of our enquiries and the room was made up every day. It included a turkish bath/shower en-suite, kettle, minibar, safe, sat-tv etc. Breakfast was a range of olives, meats, cereals and some hot options, but we chose to pick up something on the run as much as the hotel. I think the hotel's biggest asset is the location, it is only a few minutes to the main sights and access to the rest of the city, yet off the beaten touristy track which was good for nice restaurants.
