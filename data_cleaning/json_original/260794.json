The hotel has good location, it\u2019s not expensive. Room was quite simple, but clean. Towels were changed every day. WC and Shower are on the floor for joint use, but there are sink and mirror in the room. Windows face narrow street, and you can see, what is going on at opposite house, don\u2019t forget to close your curtain, if you are not exhibitionist. In the lobby there are 2 pc with internet connection. At night it was noisy. One can hear everything, what happens in corridor and in the street. I think, this hotel is more oriented to young people and backpackers, because judging by the noise many people came back to hotel after 12 p.m. and we saw only youth in corridor.

My girlfriend doesn't like the paintjob on the walls, looks like something brown and yellow mixed up on the walls :) but u can be sure, it's paint! The location is perfect if u like going to bars, restaurants, shops or the rambla.. and if u like to stay in the heart of barcelona and so u don't need to take any taxi or metro at night .U can't get any closer to the center than this for the same price. Always clean btw. Just so u know, don't expect design-furniture! No-nonsense in this hostal.

The staff were friendly but the room menacing. My innocent family were hoping for somewhere cheap and cheerful right in the historic centre but, fooled by a grainy photo of the exterior on a hotel web site, booked this one, cheapish and depressing. The owner of this establishment ought not to be rewarded with your hard-earned funds. Lying, sleepless on that bed, staring at the crazed texture of the walls and ceiling, I was drawn to imagine the tragedy of life in a 19th century lunatic asylum.

We feared the worst as I had read some poor reviews of Europa. Overall we ended up happy with our stay and we would probably be happy to go there again. It is slightly cheaper. It has a tiny elevator and not too many stairs to the entrance which is great if you have a lot luggage. The rooms reminded of staying in a very basic beach shack and it is a bit of a maze to get around. The walls are thin and the plumbing is noisy so you are relying on your fellow guests for an undisturbed nights sleep. We used the share bathrooms and they were fine, clean and plenty of hot water. The location is superb right near Ramblas and the old city as well as the market and a subway stop.

Due to structural problems at another hostel we were moved here at short notice. 10 of us stayed between 31/12/07 until today 3/1/08.We had preconceptions about EUROPA but to be honest with you we were not that bothered. Okay it's not luxury (far from). We had a mixture of en suite and communal bathrooms so we experienced both. The rooms were quite sparse but everything needed to pass the time when you were not soaking up the fantastic, fun, friendly atmosphere and believe me that time was short. The communal bathrooms were spotless and always kept spotless, as was the entire hostel. It was 24hr reception so the place was always secure and the staff always seemed willing to help. We've stayed at hotels all over the world and as you know you get what you pay for so remember that when you book here. All in all we paid around \u00a3150 each for 4 days in Barcelona getting there on new years eve morning and then experiencing one of the most amazing sites. (Approx. 70 thousand people rammed into Placa de Catalunya PEACEFULLY Letting in the new year). Centrally located in the best city in the world. DO IT and don't forget to visit SCOBIES IRISH BAR.

But no hot water, towels were envelope size..mm about A4 and sandpaper like in quality. It wasnt too noisy and is in a great area and handy in that respect. Our room also was internal so the windows opened into the internal courtyard...aromas from the toilet outlet pipes were a bit rancid. The staff were friendly enough, other residents variable. And they lent us a fan so we could have some air given we had to have the windows shut cos of the stench.
