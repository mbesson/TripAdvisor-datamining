Take the water taxi to Lido... from the Venice train station, take taxi #51 (~40 minutes). 2. When you arrive, take a right out of the water taxi station and walk along the main street. It'll take around 8 minutes to get to the hotel, which is probably about the same if you take a taxi. Walk along the main street and cross a bridge. The second street on the left will be via Dandolo then take a left. The hotel will be on the right, a tall white building. 3. A few restaurants worth mentioning... Trattoria Andri (on via Lepanto) is an excellent restaurant that movie stars and locals frequent (take a right out of the hotel, cross a bridge, take a right onto via Lepanto, walk about 3 minutes and the restaurant is on the left). Restaurants at the end of the block from the hotel is good too (take a right out of the hotel, the restaurant is located on the left just after the bridge). The restaurant just before the bridge looks packed at night, probably good too. My review of the hotel... I had a great experience. The host was very friendly and was super helpful. We received a free upgrade to a bigger room, which included a little sitting room with a sofa. The bathroom is prototypical European, super tiny but functional. The breakfast was really good, quite a variety for such a small place. The location of the hotel is very good, only about a 8-10 minute walk from the water taxi station and 1-2 minutes from restaurants / main street. Very convenient but super quiet at night. The AC worked well. Free wifi was great. Lido Island is a 10 minute water taxi ride from Venice itself... It is quiet and seems to be more local... It is not packed wall to wall with tourists, which we loved. We didn't have enough time but I think exploring the entire Lido Island would be fun (local beach, fishing village).", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cLovely\u201d", "Author": "minkyjane", "ReviewID": "UR117311207", "Content": "We stayed five night at this hotel and it was great.

The 2 relatives concerned were given ground floor rooms so they didn't have to worry about the stairs (there is no lift), one of which has a huge bathroom with walk-in shower with seat, grab rails etc. All rooms are beautiful- some are smaller than others but the smaller rooms tend to have big balconies so you gain anyway. The showers are rather snug, as others have mentioned, but they do the job fine. Breakfast is standard Italian fare- rolls, croissants, cakes, boiled eggs, cereal, juice, coffee or tea, ham, cheese etc. One morning there were very few rolls as the delivery man hadn't turned up so we ate extra croissants- not a hardship! There's a little bar in the reception where you can get a drink or a cup of tea or coffee made for you.

Or, like this Hotel, PATCH THEM! I kid you not! We were scheduled to stay 5 nights. Europe is big on using shower towels for a couple days in a row, so our habit at all the locations we stayed at, was to get clean towels every other day. They say if you throw the towel on the floor they'll replace it with a clean one, otherwise hang it up. I tossed my towel on the floor after using it twice, and when we got back that evening the towel HAD to be the same one, all folded up and placed on the rack as if it were clean. When you see a thread bear towel with patches over holes, you just know if it's the same one. And they picked it up off the floor and acted as if it were washed? I mean come on, what are the chances of getting the same towel? The bed was hard as a rock. I like a firm bed, but this was bad. No box spring, just a very firm mattress on a frame with slats of wood to hold it up. Next, it was October, not exactly the hottest time of the year, but since the sun beat on the windows from the west all afternoon the room was still stifling when we got back after 10 pm. The AC couldn't get the room any cooler than 84 degrees, and that by morning! (29 Celsius) We tried to open the windows and let the evening breeze in, but the neighbors had a dog barking ALL night long, and we were awakened each time someone up stairs used water.

First let me say that it is truw that the hotel is located in a quiet place, near to the Vaporetto stop, the room we had was indeed clean, and the size was ok. One thing which was not specified in the bookng was that the \"standard\" double room we booked was not \"standard\", since it had a bathroom for people with special needs, which made it less confortable for us to use...I asked for a room change but it was obviously impossible, because the hotel was fully booked, so the receptionist told us. The breakfast is another negative point: we arrived at 9.40, serving stopped at 10.30 on Sunday, when we got there (we weren't the last guests), the bread had finished, there 2 slices left of salami and cheese for the savoury things, and only a couple of croissants. We asked the only person who was doing the breakfast service for some bread, she first said she was sorry but they didn't have any anymore. When we clearly showed big disappointment and surprise (well maybe indignation), she asked for a few minutes, after that she came back with 4 small panini, which had gone from freezer to oven. In the meantime another couple of guests had arrived, and decided to recycle coffee, tea, and even a croissant leftover from other tables, since noone was there to attend them!

Our room (a superior-type) was at the highest floor. Very clean in every corner, not so large but with a big sofa other than bed and a wide beautiful bathroom.

We received a very warm welcome at the hotel and were shown straight up to our room. The room was quite small, but had a lovely terrace with sun loungers and table, which was a lovely surprise. We also had a bottle of Prosecco chilling, with the managers compliments. The bathroom was absolutely fine, but the shower cubical was quite small!! Breakfast was superb, with cheeses, meats, rolls, fresh fruit juices, teas, coffee etc. If you have time take a walk down the main street and head for the beach. The beach was amazing and very quiet when we visited. Lots of local shops just 2 mins away, for picnic supplies. We would thoroughy recommend staying on the Lido. You can escape the throng of tourists and you have the most amazing boat ride, morning and night as you head into the grand canal and then back to your hotel. We bought a 3 day vaparetto pass which was amazing value. Chow Venice the book has been mentioned before, and we managed to get it on Amazon. This is full of lovely traditional restaurants, away from the hustle and bustle and serving traditional italian food. An afternoon trip to Merano is also worthwhile.

Our room was very nicely decorated with a Venetian touch and with the exception of the bathroom door not opening perfectly due to the bed being too close, it didn't feel crammed. Breakfast was very good, much better than what is usually given at this price range in Italy. Besides the omnipresent pre-packaged sweet pastries, there was fresh cheese and cold cuts, cereals, yoghurt, plus fresh and hot croissant (yum).

However, my worries were ill-founded as it was just a 10 minute vaporetto ride from San Marco followed by a less than 5 minute walk to Villa delle Palme.

I checked existing reviews and they also were very good generally, so I booked it and am delighted that I did. We prefer staying on the Lido as it's quieter and less frenetic than Venice itself and is a lovely place to walk around too. The hotel is very close to the main Vaporetto stop- just a few minutes' walk. It's a stunning looking building and inside, the rooms are spotlessly clean & beautifully decorated. Having read other reviews, which mentioned that the rooms and particularly the showers, were very small, I was a little concerned, but needn't have worried. The bedroom was perfectly adequately sized and the bathroom seemed huge! The shower was fine too, so no worries there. We were in one of the ground-floor rooms, near reception, but didn't experience any problems with noise as other visitors have mentioned. The breakfast room is lovely. Again, it's beautifully decorated and clean and the breakfast was more than adequate. Some reviewers on this and other sites, had commented that only croissants, cake and jam were on offer. Whether the owner has taken this criticism on board, or whether he's just changed his menu, I don't know, but now you can choose cereals, yoghurt, bread rolls, cheese, hams, croissants, etc, plus tea, coffee & fruit juice. You can eat as much as you like. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, recommending places to eat and things to visit. There's a wonderful tower on top of the hotel and I strongly suggest that you borrow the key from reception and go up for a look. The view of Venice and the Lido is stunning and it makes an ideal spot to take pictures or just to sit and relax. On the morning we checked-out, we mentioned to the owner that we weren't due to fly home until later that evening and he very kindly offered to keep our luggage at the hotel so that we could spend the rest of the day walking around Venice without having to lug our bags around. With regard to previous comments about security, there was one occasion when we went back to the hotel after an evening meal and found nobody on the reception desk. I agree that this could be a cause for concern but feel that on the whole, as the desk was manned almost constantly and the crime rate in Venice is so low, it's probably less of an issue than in many other areas!

I had paid top price for a double superior room and we were checked into a room directly beside the reception. When i questioned this I was told that's what I would get for what I paid, even though the two rooms with balconies were free upstairs. The reception was unmanned most of the time we were there. We were woken by the phone in the reception ringing and also by the guests upstairs whenever they used the bathroom...no soundproof walls! The worst part was that on our final day we were waiting to check out and as usual there was nobody on reception we ended up having to search the hotel for a member of staff and eventually found someone in the basement after about twenty minutes of searching and three knocks on the door of the room he was in. This resulted in us missing the boat we had planned to get and almost missing our flight. In general the hotel is nice, the room was okay for 65 euro a night but i would expect their superior room to have something extra. It is very clean and when you can get a hold of some staff members they are reasonaby friendly.

Friendly and helpful staff, however....My wife and I were looking for a small quiet hotel for our stay in Venice. We stayed in the french 2pax room which by the way is tiny (practically a small double bed, small desk and wardrobe with not much other space). The first night we tried to get to bed early (around 10pm), but because of the poor soundproofing between rooms it was interrupted by listening to your neighbours going to the toilet, using the hairdryer, closing the shower door and voices - from all sides and above. Needless to say we were woken every so often until everyone was in bed sleeping. This is not what you expect from a \"3\" star hotel. The second and third evening were a repeat. All in all we did not get the ideal rest you would expect. Additionally the bed was not great quality and the blackout would still let light in. If you want a quiet and peaceful hotel, I do not recommend this one. Tips for Venice: Buy the tourist 72hour ticket for the Vaporetta, if you're staying for at least 3 days (25 EUR). For a slower but interesting trip to Lido (should you stay there) take the number 1, through the grand canal on to Lido. For quick trips from Lido take the LN (direct to San Marco Piazza). If you would like to go to the free beach in Lido go to the opposite side of the Vaporetta stop and walk down the main road.
