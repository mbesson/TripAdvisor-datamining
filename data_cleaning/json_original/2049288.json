I made a report to the police and the manager with no luck. My door was always locked. The only people with access to my room was cleaning personel and staff. The police I spoke with told me that this was not the first time he'd been to this hotel for this. When I notice the theft I also noticed that while my bed had been made nothing else had be cleaned. Toilet paper was still empty, garbage bin was still full. Towels were still dirty and on the floor. Floor itself was needing vacuuming. But iPad2, iPod Nano, Fendi Glasses, Violin accessories, jewelery, and other stuff was missing. Which led me to the conclusion that the woman who cleaned my room was so busy going through my stuff that she had no time to notice the pertinent cleaning jobs needing to be done. The manager Andreas did nothing but give me false hope of filing an insurance claim with the hotel insurance, which I knew was not going to happen. A total loss of over $2000. No security cameras or notes of who cleaned my room and when to be relied upon. Basically stay away and find a hotel with decent security.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value and location\u201d", "Author": "Alexs257", "ReviewID": "UR124971453", "Content": "We've stayed here before on a number of occasions and would recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in the Kudamm.

Emailed beforehand to request a room overlooking Kurfurstendamm and that is exactly what we got, great view of the lights outside. We arrived at 11pm after getting off the train at the wrong stop - unfortunately the only place we could get food at that time was the Subway next door and it was inedible. We also tried to get a bottle of wine at the hotel bar but the lady said they did not sell wine at all. So we had to make do with 2 cups of coffee - not a great start. Breakfast was good, lovely views and included in the price of the room. Our room (408) was fairly spacious with a nice bathroom, no complaints at all. They also stored our luggage on the day of departure as our flight was late evening. Had lunch in Ka De We store one day in the fish bar, it was lovely but don't try and take any pictures of the chef!! We went to various Xmas markets, the nicest of which was at Schloss Charlottenburg - don't bother going in the palace itself though, very expensive and the staff were quite rude, also there is not much to see in there. We probably won't return to Berlin as we have been there twice now but I would recommend this hotel as a great no frills hotel near public transport.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGood value, reasonable location\u201d", "Author": "LoneBrit", "ReviewID": "UR122393982", "Content": "A friendly, comfortable hotel with clean, modern looking rooms and a decent breakfast. (beware of the fruit - the melon balls were still frozen, but generally the breakfast compares well to what you could get outside for the price). Staff were friendly - though I was unimpressed when they changed my room and phoned me late at night after I'd gone to bed to tell me so. The initial room was quite spacious with a bath. the smaller single room was adequate but no bath. It did have the advantage of a balcony. Rooms contained easy to use safe, but no tea / coffee facilities. No internet terminals in hotel (but can be accessed from a laptop). 24 hour internet available at Adenauerplatz (about 3 minute walk away). Approx 5 minutes to S-Bahn at Savignyplatz - direct line west to Potsdam or east to central and east Berlin. 15 minute walk, along Ku-damm, to Zoo & Kaiser Wilhelm church. Nearest U-Bahn at Adenauerplatz - but requires a change to get to most places of interest so S-Bahn is generally easier. For decent meal at a reasonable price try 'Grafitti' bar / restaurant at Adenauerplatz. Bus 109 from Tegel airport stops almost right outside the hotel (1st stop after Adenauerplatz if coming from the airport) .

I visit Berlin every year and, although I knew where this hotel was, I had never stayed there. The location is good and easily reached by bus from the Zoo and Tegal, just take the 109 bus as it stops right outside the hotel. Although Adenauerplatz U-Bahn is a short walk away it is not the best line and neither is Uhlandstrasse, it is better to take the 10 minute walk to Charlottenburg U and S; this saves time and gives access to more routes. The hotel is very clean and the room was warm, clean and well furnished. The bathroom was also clean and spacious compared to many. The room was cleaned daily and all of the staff I encountered were friendly and efficient, not always the case with cheaper hotels. The only negative was the noise from outside. I had a room on the 6th floor overlooking the Ku-damm and I was surprised at the level of noise despite double glazed windows. However I would still choose the same room as the view of the Christmas decorations and the photo opportunity afforded by the balcony outweighs the noise.

The rooms are basic but clean with the beds comfortable and the bathroom fine, although bath plug did leak somewhat meaning tap had to be left on during taking of bath. The reception staff were excellent and very approachable with a very good grasp of English. We did not require breakfast in hotel as we are light eaters and used the Back Factory beside the Adenauer U-Bhan which provides a coffee with a choice of pastries and filled rolls for a couple of Euros, The Hotel looks onto the Ku\"damm and is easily reached from Schonfeld airport Buy a two hour single ticket costing 3 Euros at the airport. Make sure ticket is stamped and validated at start of journey. Catch one of the frequent buses, X7 or 171, to Rudow U-Bhan. This will take seven minutes journey time. The bus stops outside station and trains leave U-Bhan every 6 minutes. This station is the terminus for the U7 line and will take you to Adenauer U-Bhan in 36 minutes which is only a few minutes from the hotel.

The hotel is also within good walking distance of several bakers, restaurants, supermarkets, the History of Germany Museum and a theatre.
