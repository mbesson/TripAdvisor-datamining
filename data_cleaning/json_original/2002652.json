The hotel is located out of the centre of town, with the nearest MRT station located at Novena. The walk from the station is about 10 minutes past the hospital, with the hotel located on the left hand side at the bottom of Irrawaddy road, on the junction of Balistier Road. If using a taxi it is better to mention Balistier road, as the taxi's we used didn't have a clue where Irrawaddy road was. As Singapore has an obsession with regulation, maybe they should insist all taxi's should have SATNAV linked to their meters. The rooms were basic, comfortable and clean and served the purpose of a bed for the night and had a good shower. The rooms are a little small and would be frustrating if you spent a lot of time in them, which we didn't. Internet access was good with free wifi. Staff were polite and helpful and delivered on everything we asked (sort aircon and book taxis). Singapore is an expensive city and we probably stayed at the most expensive time of year. The room rate we paid was about UK \u00a3100 a night, and was cheaper to book through the TRIVAGO website rather than the IBIS website.

Spent 6 nights with them. Pros: 1) 1-3 min walk to the nearest bus stop (very convenient) 2) Clean, ample-sized, cold room 3) Modern design 4) Early check-in possible 5) Front desk staff are helpful 6) Free in room wi-fi (speed depends on the time) 7) You can take the bust to the MRT station from which you can get anywhere you like or walk 15-20 mins going there. Warning, it's very hot in SG so if you want to arrive to your destination fresh, I suggest you take the bus. Public transport is quite cheap. Cons: 1) Bathroom quite small but do-able 2) Can't walk to the nearest tourist attraction if you're in SG for leisure 3) Price a little expensive for it's location but a lot of hotels in SG are more expensive 4) Breakfast is okay for 2 days but for a week long, you would rather eat somewhere else. So I suggest just take your breakfast outside. 5) The have the world's smallest fridge/cooler. But it can fit four 500ml bottles of water. 6) Water is not free. It would've been nice if they provided some considering the price of the hotel. I'll recommend it if you need to do something within Novena area but not if you're here for a vacation most especially if you're first timers. The hotel is fairly new (1 year old I think).

My first impression of the hotel is that the lobby is small without much aircon and luggages were kept all over the lobby.I got a 2 single beds room located at 10 floor(highest floor).There are 3 new lifts available, travel at a slow speed.My room was right at the corner,room was slighly spacious compare with other buget htl.There is not even any city view from my rm as is block by another higher appartment which is very close to the htl.The htl provide free strong Wifi,32inch LCD TV,coffee/tea maker and a tiny little fridge(just big enough for ONLY 2 small bottle of water) The bath room was tiny without bath tub and some basic of toiletries.I would like to highlight is that there is not even a single hander for you to hand your towel or clothes inside the bath rm. My nightmare came when about to sleep. The soundproof of the room was horrible,I heard ppl chattering,slaming the door etc.Early in the morning I even heard ppl rushing for chk out.I can hardly have any slp during the night. The breakfast was \"just OK'' which cost SGD$15++,they serve about 7 hot dishes (include plain steamed rice and porridge)which taste \"so so\",fruits,beverages and pastries.Their worse dish is their fried noodle which taste cold n soggy other then that other dishes still acceptable.Overall I prefer to a cup of hot cafe latte serve with hot toast bread. Even ibis are classified as buget hotel but is still cost about $220 for my one night stay.If got other choice with this type of hotel rate in SG I would never choose ibis Novena.Located wise I don't find it convenient even the htl provide hourly(not every hr) free shuttle service to Novena stn or even Orchard but you hardly get a chance to reserve a seat as the \"bus\" only take up 10 pax per trip.I tried to reserve the day before but from 10-12pm were all fully book.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belmont, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Accommodation at Budget Price\u201d", "Author": "Darra A", "ReviewID": "UR127900381", "Content": "On arrival, made to feel welcome and we were offered refreshing cold dinks while checking in.

For starters, the hotel is a quick trip up the expressway from the airport, although be mindful that our taxi driver did get lost and tried to drop us off at the wrong hotel up the road. Once we arrived, we were given a no fuss early check in at 8.30am as they had a room available and we had just flown a red-eye flight in. Very nice. Although we did not use too many services of the hotel, we did ask for a few things from housekeeping during our stay - trivial stuff like more toilet paper or an extra hand towel, because they weren't replaced or had been taken away after they had cleaned the room. The hotel has a policy that says that if you have a problem, they'll fix in 15 minutes and the one time we called the front desk with a request (of more toilet paper) it took about half an hour. No problem right, except somebody (and I won't name names) was sitting on the toilet and the paper hadn't been replenished, nor a spare roll left. Also, do not leave your spare door card in the power slot if you get your room cleaned because housekeeping will take it away and you'll be left with one door card. You also need your card to access the elevators up. The hotel also offers a free shuttle van that holds eight people and can take you to Novena MRT or Orchard Road. It leaves the hotel (and the other 2 locations) at set times a couple of times a day, which is great when it's raining. But sometimes the van runs late and you either wait, walk or catch a bus or taxi. The hotel offers free wifi, which is great, unless you're using it during peak times, which is basically in the evenings. During those times we found wifi very, very slow. But there are 2 computers downstairs in the lobby if there's anything you need to quickly check online. But if you are loitering around the hotel lobby, be careful of the frequent drop of condensation that falls from the air-con vents above. I think they were fixing this during our stay, but by the time we checked out, there were still small pools of water on the floor around the hotel lobby. We also made a phone call to a local mobile phone and spoke for over 15 minutes and the bill when checking out was $1. We had a room on the 4th floor, facing outwards onto Balestier Road. Not much of a view unless you like looking at petrol stations or lighting and bathroom shops. The rooms were very clean and simple, all we really needed since we were out from 9am and only returned very late in the evenings to shower, watch a bit of TV and sleep. There are 16 TV channels with several in other Asian languages, CNN, News Asia, an Aussie channel, 2 sport channels and also a cartoon channel. There's also the typical Ibis info channel, which lists the daily room cost (we saw it fluctuate from as low as $148++ to $228++ during our stay, and even saw them adjusting it onscreen whilst we sat there watching TV. They also have the weather, which wasn't updated for several days at times and they also list their exchange rate. We slept well every night and although the bed was a little hard and the pillows a little too high for our tastes, the room was very quiet. We could hardly hear any outside traffic from our 4th floor room, and only the odd scraping of a chair on the floorboards from above now and them. Fair enough we heard the odd person slamming their door shut or talking loudly in the hallway, and even kids running past, but that's not the fault of the hotel and during our long stay, it was far and few between. The room has a small shoe box fridge that will chill 2 small bottles of water and tetra pack sized drinks overnight. Just don't do what I did and fill it with 12 tetra pack drinks because it took 3 days to even cool down. Leave 5 or 6 small drinks or 2 600ml bottles in there and they'll chill overnight. Air conditioning was maybe a little noisy, but not annoying, but the range of temperatures and fan speed and reaction time allowed us to cool or warm the room quickly and easily. After storing 2 suitcases in the room, one on the large desk and the other on a cushioned seat, it only left the desk chair or the bed to lounge around on, which wasn't a problem. The bathroom is a little tight which means you'll have to brush you teeth one at a time in there. And when you're showering, be careful not to knock the shower lever and accidentally turn it off as you move around in your triangular shower cubicle. At least it's a glass screen so you don't have to put up with shower curtains molesting you whilst you wash. One of the big draw cards of the hotel is it's location on Balestier Road. The MRT is a brisk 10 minute uphill and downhill, mostly covered walk. But if you're feeling lazy and didn't take the shuttle van, you can catch the 131 or the 21 bus 3 stops to the station (and shopping centre). The bus stop is only around the corner from the hotel and buses run very frequently. You also have the option of catching a bus to your destination instead and not worrying about the train. All bus shelters have a list of the buses and their routes on panels (all which remain graffiti and vandalism free). There are many local eateries down the road from the hotel, on both sides of the road, plus a 7Eleven only a couple of hundred meters away. There are a few local favorite eateries within walking distance from Ibis, including a couple of places that boasts to have the best chicken rice, and another that boasts to have the best durian in Singapore. And since you can't take durian on the bus, train, taxi and/or your hotel, what better place to try it. Taxis are so common around the area because of the nearby hospitals and the business of Balestier Road, so be careful not to scratch your head as all the passing taxi drivers will veer over to you thinking that you're flagging them down. Be aware that there is a new building (when isn't there a new building being constructed) being built across the road and you can hear a bit of that noise if you're in your room during the day. If you're a non-smoker, I'd avoid the 3rd floor. If you are, I'd ask for the 3rd floor. There is an outdoor smoking 'room' located between rooms 328 and 332 and I'd imagine that smoke will inadvertently drift into the hall and possibly into your room. I saw one gentleman standing with his foot holding the smoking room door ajar, while he happily smoked in the hallway on level 3 (you can see because there are windows on level 4 that look down into the smoking room). Ibis Novena is a hotel we would happily stay again - if the price was right. Considering the length of time we stayed, we had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. The hotel caters well for the solo traveler, families and friends (we had more family fly in and join us halfway through our stay taking up another 4 rooms, and only one didn't end up on the same floor as us). It's location allows you to experience a bit of the heartlands of Singapore (except for the expats and their families living around the area), with all the main tourist haunts only a quick bus, MRT or taxi ride away.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cNOISY HOTEL :(\u201d", "Author": "globalinvest", "ReviewID": "UR126651603", "Content": "I looked forward to staying at the Novena Ibis b/c it was newly built & a 5 min walk to the MRT Novena but it turned out to be such a HUGE disappointment!!

There are built in shelving units and a wardrobe 'Ikea-style' which maximize use of the small space. Bathroom amenities are basic. Everything is new, and while most of the amenities and decor is budget standard, the bed was very comfortable and linens very clean. Dining is similarly not exactly haute cuisine and I wasn't that impressed with the breakfast offerings. Avoid unless it comes included in the room rate. Unlike most hotels and condos in Singapore, the Ibis does not come with any pool facilities.

It is about 10 mins walk from the nearest MRT, but taxis in Singapore are very cheap. If it is raining then about 60% of the walk is covered thanks to the Foreign Affairs office nearby. The hotel is no-frills. There's a lobby, the restaurant and that's about it in terms of facilities. The reception gets quite crowded at busy times but there are three desks and always staff around. Places to eat around the hotel are mostly food courts, where you can find some delicious grub but they're not at all appropriate for business eating. The restaurant in the hotel was better than I expected. Waiting staff were very attentive. The rooms are small, as you would expect, but they are fitted out smartly. There is a desk, very small fridge (good for keeping some bottles of water in, that's about it) and large TV with a very limited number of international channels (CNN the main one) but it does have video and audio input jacks for you to hook your laptop up to. The international electrical sockets are useful if you've got plugs from everywhere and not all the right adapters. Bed is comfortable (what you expect from a hotel chain) and there is adequate storage for clothing etc, although some drawers would have been useful. There is a small safe, air conditioning, and free Wifi which is slow but usable. The bathroom is fine, shower pressure ok but not power-shower high. Bathroom clean, could probably have done with special attention to a few corners but generally acceptable. Despite leaving my towels on the rails every day, they were still replaced until I personally asked housekeeping to leave them. A comment about the bedroom is that there is a wood-effect vinyl floor instead of a carpet. Although probably better for cleaning, it isn't so pleasant walking around in your bare feet on it, and makes the room feel all the less cosy. For the price though - and hotels in Singapore are expensive - this is a reliable choice. The independents have very mixed reviews and complaints about noise and poor aircon. You won't have those issues at the Ibis as it's a new hotel, purpose-built. My room did not have a connecting door as mentioned in some of the other reviews, so it might be an idea to request one without.

It's not a touristy shopping district, but a lot more authentic than the tourist crowds on Orchard. Bus connections to Orchard Rd are easy, and there are plenty of taxies to hail on Balestier.

The heather at shower in the bathroom is not funtioning well, please do be careful on adjusting the temperature.

Since it was part of our Singapore vacation we expectted it to be a great hotel like our other hotels have been with Singapore Vacations. Our travel agent had reserved a room with twin beds. When we checked into the hotel they told us(a friend) that they didn't have a twin room that is not what our agent reserved. It was a queen room. We insisted and the agent checking us in put us in a twin room. We got to the room and within ten minutes another person called and said we couldn't keep the room and were moving us back to a queen. She came up with a key and moved. I called my husband in the states and had him call the travel company and talk to someone. They confirmed that we indeed had a queen room and called someone at the hotel and we were moved in the morning. This was not a pleasant experience. We inquired at the desk about calling a cab to take us somewhere and were told that a taxi would charge us $5 just to come to the hotel and we'd do better if we walked a block and got a taxi on the street. Our room faced a construction site where men were working and we had to keep our blinds drawn during most of the time. Men working could look into our room. The hotel is new and rooms are so tiny. No closet, no chair . When I went to breakfast in the morning it was full of school children(well behaved) on a school trip. I do believe this is the type of hotel it is. Not a hotel where adults go for a nice stay and rest and touring. It was poorly located and construction going on on both sides of the street. There is a mall about a 10 min. walk away but on the street in front of the hotel are tile shops and shops with bathroom fixtures. I cannot imagine why this hotel was used as part of a vacation package. Our hotel in Bangkok was wonderful and well located.

The bathroom was also small but adequate. We asked for a quiet room on check-in but was given a room next to the elevator shaft.

The train station is closer then the Bencoolen Ibis. Although taxi's are so convenient and very cheap in Singapore. This is a good 3 star hotel.

We got a pretty good rate as an opening special and due to expensive hotel prices we'd seen we decided to give this hotel a go. Being slightly wary due to other not-so-great reviews and the possibility of the hotel still having 'teething problems' we were both pleasantly surprised at the fantastic stay we had here! I agree with others that taxi drivers have no idea about the hotel due to it's just being open so I would recommend you say 'novena' and 'near balestier rd' as this is a main rd on which the hotel corners. I would also recommend the nearest mrt (novena) which is a short walk away (slightly uphill!) and if you prefer a closer option there are buses on balestier rd that head into the city. Now the hotel itself: we arrived at 3am due to delayed flight so had no competition checking in. Staff were very efficient and polite. We requested a quiet room as had read reviews of construction next door (still ongoing as of may 19) and got just this. Were very happy about that! The rooms are small but functional and Beds are comfy. the bathroom is very decent, with enough room to be comfortable and the shower is seperated by a screen door so keeps the floor dry. If you're strategic with you can store suitcases under the beds which frees up all the floor space. There's also a large desk and chair plus a couchy seat by the large window. This was a good idea as it keeps the room bright. Unfortunately there is no fridge in the room, but truthfully after 1 day we got used to it and just purchased long-life milk from the supermarket for our hot drinks and this was fine. We were so happy with the room and cleanliness of the room and hotel. It is brand new so of course all the areas look fantastic and 'shiny'. We never ate in the restaurant as we just booked the lowest basic rate but the buffet Breakfast food looked really good. I enjoyed my stay here thoroughly and thought the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially kindly holding our luggage for 7 hours after we checked out! The location is very good too, close to mrt which is 2 stops from orchard and 4 stops from city hall. Also the mrt is under a pretty good shopping centre (novena square) which has restaurants, supermarket and many specialty stores where we had breakfast and several meals.

Apart from that missing amenity, it was a nice place to stay in every other way, fulfilling its purpose, mainly as a basic hotel.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "brisbane", "Title": "\u201cSuper low or don't go!\u201d", "Author": "shez12", "ReviewID": "UR107070673", "Content": "The only reason we chose to stay here was because we managed to book during their super low 'name your own price' opening special rate ($71AUD for 2 nights - no kidding!) + we payed for a full rate for an extra night ($145AUD). Singapore being and extremly expensive city for accomodation - it seemed like a good bargain! Location wise it is quite far from main attractions, a 7 minute walk up hill to nearest novena MRT. Most taxi drivers do not know where it is because its so new and its actually on the corner of balestier & irrawaddy rd. There is novena shopping centre and a 24hr eatery and some restaurants nearby. Also, a yummy 'tau sar' biscuit place just down the road. Rooms are pretty much standard size - same as other Ibis hotels. Things I don't like about the room is the curtain rail was pretty tacky and the water pressure was horrendous - inconsistent hot and cold water!! When we stayed the establishment was only about 80% running interms of facilities (one of the lifts was not operational, the downstairs female toilets have plumbing issues, no gym yet). You could definetly tell which were the more experienced staff members. I had problems with my booking because I had to book seperately in order to get the special rate. I told them I didn't want to have to check-out the next day and they said it was fine they took both my reservation numbers... only to find that after returning from my hotel on the 2nd night we were locked out of our room because the guy who checked us in forget to amend the duration of our stay. Then the staff asked us to provide the reservation no. again and we told her we already gave both of them to the guy that checked us in. She couldn't find the 2nd res. no. because she didn't handle our check-in and told us to check our emails again. Luckily the guy that checked us in was still there and we pointed him out but he was already preparing to go home. Eventually, she gave us access back to our room and we told her we would sort the matter out in the morning. There was also another angry customer who was locked out at that time as well! Worse of all was during this time is must have been shift change time so there was only 1 person serving customers.. super slow. The guy that checked us in was off for the day but was still standing there playing with his mobile while there was a super long queue for service. And yet we had to wait for the new staff to start work - seriously it doesn't hurt to work a little extra. I would recommend waiting another 6 months or until they have full facilities and better staff service/training. But even than the location plumbing/water issues wouldn't really make up for the standard price they want to charge - there are definetly better hotels out there!", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cLots of improvement required\u201d", "Author": "miawhua", "ReviewID": "UR106689375", "Content": "I've booked it through online at a special rate for the opening special promo. i was told that check in time was 2pm.

Again the staff came to the rescue and offered to store our goods in Kitchen Fridge. Construction Noise next door is earth shattering so don't expect a peaceful stay for the next few months. Breakfast is basic but the Fresh ground coffee machines lifted our breakfast experience.. Staff were very friendly and helpful which was needed to override the negatives of this new Hotel. I hope management can take the hint to acquire fridges and a porter service and fix the hot water which is very inconsistent, then I would highly recommend ibis novena once adjacent construction is complete.

The other road in busy Balestier Road and is ideal to hail a cab or grab a bus. The hotel has a very open, ground floor dining area with huge windows that face directly onto both roads. Great to be part of the streetscape, and be in air-con comfort. My daughter and I shared a room \u2013 it was smallish and only just adequate. The bathroom has a shower, toilet and a corner wash basin only \u2013 all a bit too compact for two. There was a convenient desk type area if you have office work to do. The wireless internet connection operates through all rooms from what I understand, it was very easy to access and operated seamlessly. I think the hotel could work well for business types. Not fancy, \u2026just practical. We arrived on opening day, \u2026yep, it was all brand new! (Just loved the smell of freshly painted walls in the crowded reception area on check in). The hotel certainly had its share of first week jitters \u2013 like a failed motor in the exhaust system for the kitchen during dinner. All the dining area was filled with cooking smoke. To the credit of GM Shamila, she was on hand to advise the guests of what had happened and apologised profusely for the inconvenience. It was fixed the next day! There were also a number of trainees on the team in all areas of operations, some were brilliant, \u2026and others? ...well, they needed a bit more training! The highly visible areas, like dining, seemed to worked well You could still tell there was some startup nervousness. Some of the team were a little 'over' attentive and not relaxed with how things can work well without fuss. Some of the facilities are still to come online, like the fitness centre and guest laundry. All part of the newness and getting the place operating. The management team was very visible and responsive during this 'nervous' week. Thanks GM Shamila and OM Stuart. Only real issue that you need to be aware is that the hotel prices are + +. That is the rate is advertised without inclusions for breakfast and two taxes totaling another 17%.
