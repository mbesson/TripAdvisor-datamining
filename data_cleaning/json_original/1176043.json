{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Villas available for rental - no golf required Located in SE Puerto Rico. Have stayed several times - clean, neat villas, friendly staff and great hosts  ChiChi and his wife.Not many acceptable hotel options in the area but I found El Legado a few years ago while cruising the net - very happy I found ChiChi's place. Not a golfer but the course is in great shape and have heard many positive comments from golfers there.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR300991621", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BillMassParkNY"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147319-d1176043-r20616035-El_Legado_Golf_Resort-Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "1176043", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
