Not because of a vacation, but due t a sick family member who lives in the next town (Lajas). We choose to stay here mostly because of the location, however we found that in this particular hotel, we got what we needed as far as accomodations. The areas where it lacked we did not really care that much about. The place was always clean, Never saw bugs, or rodents. They have always been nice, to the point that they remembered us by name. (after all we have stayed there about 5-6 times). They have security, the car is parked in a gated area. There is a nice view from the roof. Its close enough to the waterfront, but not too close that the noise bothers you. The place could use, better cable TV (only 3-4 channels available), The remotes could get replaced (for the TV and the AC units) The AC is cold, just remember its off when you first get there, so you have to let them run in order to cool the place down. Once the place cools down, you will need a comforter to stay warm. When ever we stayed we always got the biggest room, we wanted the king size bed. So the price was a bit high. Like I said before we were paying for the convinience. I could have found a cheaper place, but it would have been further away, and it may have lacked in areas that we actually care more about. Everyones view is going to be different, this may not be the place for everyone, but we would consider staying there again, if needed. I know what to expect when I stay there. This part of the island is not full of choices. Their websites will never show you the negatives, just the positives. then once you are there its too late to do anyting about it.", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olmsted Falls, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "wmsf", "ReviewID": "UR13651883", "Content": "We stayed for 2 nights here.

The hotel restaurant was closed except for Thursday, another disappointment. Alas, there was no elevator either. There was no coffee/breakfast available on site. Overall the place seemed clean to me. It took a bit of effort to get the lay of the land in La Parguera but eventually found the boats to go out for a night swim in the biophosforencent bay. (I recommend Johnny's Boats instead of the bigger 'glass bottom' boat: $6 for a short trip.) My favorite part of the stay was the common area (on each floor). I had the 3rd floor to myself (no other guests) and enjoyed the table and chairs, a sort of patio/veranda. Compared to the other options I was satisfied with the accommodations for what I paid ($80/night). A side note, I loved opening the door and windows in the morning and listening to the roosters crow from one side of town to the other (could not be heard without opening up the room). Also, across the street, the little roadside Cafe Jaimito opened early and offered great breakfast sandwiches and coffee.

Before I get into the details, I want to explain we are not prima donna travelers who require lots of amenities--we usually stay at basic accommodations and have done so in places like Costa Rica, Belize and Puerto Rico. Sadly, we were really looking forward to our stay at Torres de la Parguera. The hotel Web site describes it as a \"touch of excellence\" and so we splurged for a 2 night stay at the end of our trip to Puerto Rico and booked a suite. The main reason for our terrible experience is the lack of cleanliness in the room. There was hair everywhere--in the bedsheets, on the floor, behind the bed, stuck to the hair dryer, and even some men's beard hairs and a wet handprint in the box of tissues. Dried food particles on placemats in the little kitchenette. Greasy handprints on the windows. I could go on, but you get the idea. Aside from the lack of cleaniliness, everything was run down--torn and dirty bedskirt on the bed, beat up furniture, etc. We initially hoped the room had simply been over-looked by the cleaning staff that day, and asked the front desk attendant for assistance. She could not have cared less, and also made no effort to contact the manager or owner (the owner was on the premises the whole time). The cleaning staff had gone home for the day, and they let us use another room for the night. It was marginally cleaner, but the air conditioner emitted a moldy smell. This room was only available for one night, so the next day we had to move back to the first room. The next day the cleaning staff (two very nice women) did a great job cleaning the room, and even went to Wal-Mart to buy a new bedskirt. Later that day there was a heavy rainstorm, and water streamed under the front door of our room because of improper drainage/gutters from the roof. The maintenance person who brought us towels for the floor indicated this wasn't the first time the room had flooded. Lastly, I have to mention the continental breakfast included in our rate. All the food was in its original store-bought packaging--white wonder-style bread, a carton of orange juice, a package of danish, and a deli platter of ham. The only cups available for juice or coffee were tiny--slightly larger than a dixie cup--so we had to drink about 8 tiny cups of bad coffee to begin to face the day, especially after a night in our hair infested room.", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PUERTO RICO", "Title": "\u201cNice small hotel\u201d", "Author": "golflover58", "ReviewID": "UR5549772", "Content": "This is a nice small hotel in the fishermen's village called La Parguera in Southwestern Puerto Rico.It is not a beachfront property.It just has a pool,and it is close to the sea but to to get to a swimming area you will have to get a boat.There are plenty of shuttle boats that take you back and forth from and to small keys where you will find sparkling clear water to take a dip.It is a quaint little quiet town and this hotel is the newest.The restaurant is really good.", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "milwaukee WI", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4727172", "Content": "Amazing staff, very hospitable and safe environment.
