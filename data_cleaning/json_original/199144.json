I always feel something of a cheapskate when I stay at a hotel on this basis but then I do spend a lot of money in Tesco: it used a lot of vouchers for one weekend. It was splendid! From arriving an hour before check in: a few people arrived at the same time and immediately more staff swung into action so no queuing. Our room was ready though we were early and we had been given an upgrade to a king size room which was beautiful, roomy, very very clean. It also had everything we might need. Little extras requested were promptly dealt with. Indeed staff throughout our stay were wonderful, so pleasant, polite, eager to help, checking that everything was ok without being intrusive or fussy. Just right. Our Tesco deal included breakfast which would otherwise have cost \u00a329 which is quite expensive, but quality and choice of food was excellent. Poached eggs exactly right! Staff in the restaurant were lovely too. The location is great of course. I tend to like the hotels I stay in as I do my research in advance but this is the first time I can truly say I found no fault. i like to try different hotels when I visit London exploring different areas etc but now feel I have to go back here as it was so so nice.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Florida", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GypsyJoey", "ReviewID": "UR126270006", "Content": "We felt like royalty in the gorgeous corner suite!

We also received complimentary chocolate covered strawberries once we got into our room because of our honeymoon. Being right on Park Lane is great, and having tube stops at either end of Hyde Park is very convenient. We brought the tube in from Heathrow to Hyde Park Corner, then walked up to the hotel, which really wasn't too long of a walk with a large suitcase.

We stayed using Marriott points. We were checked in immediately upon arrival and had no wait at the reception. As Gold Marriott Rewards Members, we were given a lovely upgrade to an Executive Floor Room (7th floor) with an amazing view of the American Embassy, the London Eye, and Big Ben! The room had a large, extremely comfortable king size bed with wonderful crisp, clean, white linens and duvet. It had two chairs, a desk, and a bench at the end of the bed (no sofa). It was spacious and roomy for a large city. We also had ample closet space and a decent sized marble bathroom with wonderful shower (handheld and rain). The toilet was close enough to the sink that you could almost kiss it! But it is an old hotel that has been renovated. The paint is all new and the furniture is elegant and in perfect condition as was the carpeting. Luxurious fluffy robes and slippers await you to enjoy your daily paper delivered to your door. Elegant molding and a tray ceiling complete the details. Thick curtains block the morning light, and sheers allow you to enjoy the blue lights of the London Eye, if you prefer. The room had a nice flat-screen with a DVD player. The concierge floor (accessible by Gold and Platinum Marriott Members and those on the executive floor) has a nice selection of DVDs for free loan. Our DVD player did not work at first. We had four staff members try their hand at getting it to work. After a couple of hours of different ones attempting to help us, finally we brought a new one. (To turn it on, go to channel 1 then press the - negative button once to get to the DVD screen. It wasn't explained anywhere and the staff usually didn't know the trick either.) The concierge/executive lounge is large and spacious and is nicely appointed with comfortable furniture--mostly two person tables, but also a couple of couches and a flat screen tv. The view is only of a brick building across the street (the Washington DC concierge lounge has a fabulous view). But there are several wonderful staff on hand at all times to help arrange use of their meeting room or to help you make reservations for dinner or find directions to a museum or theatre. Staff were very friendly and would inquire about our show the next morning and see if the directions had been easy to follow. They also have board games for children to borrow as well. Breakfast is hearty and delicious and is served from 6 to 11 am. It appeared to be fully replenished the entire time. It included cereals, muffins, pastries, meats, cheeses, scrambled and boiled eggs, bacon and sausage links, juices, milks (skim, semi, and not), coffee, espresso, tea, hot chocolate, fruit (fabulous fresh pineapple!), and more. Afternoon tea is served from 2:30 to 5. We popped back from touring a couple of times by 4:30, but found most of the food already cleaned up and put away. Once we found a couple of scrumptious, still warm scones left, but usually just dried fruit and nuts or a few cookies were left. Hot drinks, bottled water, and chilled sodas (ginger ale, bitter lemon, pepsi, diet pepsi, and a few others) were available all day. Wines and more were available for free from 5:30 to 9:30. Canapes were available from 6 to 8 pm. The two nights we were there during this time, they served cut fresh vegetables such as cucumbers, carrots, peppers, cauliflower, cheeses, grapes, hummus and pita, mini spring rolls with duck, chicken, or vegetables, and mini hot dogs rolled in pastry. Cookies also appeared at times--white chocolate with macadamia nuts and cranberry/raisin ones. All meals were served with lovely china and silverware. We arrived by tube, taking the Picadilly (dark blue) line from Heathrow and changing to the Central (red) line to the Marble Arch stop. it's an hour trip, not the 30 minutes the Marriott website advertises. Make sure you know what terminal your flight will be departing before you make your return trip--check the Heathrow website before you leave the hotel. The Tube has different stops for Terminal 4, Terminals 1 to 3, and Terminal 5. Traveling before 9:30 am is more expensive, but was less than 3 pounds for a child under age 15 and under 8 pounds for an adult. A chauffered car (can be arranged by the hotel) is about 80 pounds. A taxi is a similar fee. If you want to save your pounds to see a few extra shows, get an oyster card for an adult and a daily travel card for a child for the Underground, if you don't have much luggage and can handle a few stairs and a 10 minute walk. Make sure you are at the JW Marriott, not the Marriott--both are on Park Lane, a quarter mile apart. Because we were celebrating my son's arrival in teen hood, the staff provided a lovely cheesecake with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate--delivered to our room on our first evening's arrival. We were very impressed by the concierge staff's willingness to e-mail answers to questions we had before arrival (since we are Marriott Gold Members). But they did not seem to know places to recommend for picky American children to eat. The good news is there is a McDonald's 10 minutes walk away--just beyond the Marble Arch Tube Station, on the left. Additionally there is a Pizza Hut at the same tube station--but take a right instead. It looked very small from the outside, but go downstairs and there is a nice modern roomy dining room. They have thin and thick crust, had many specials, and appeared to have some good buffet specials at lunch and again from 3 to 5 pm. A six slice pizza was only 8 pounds. We wish we had tried it before our last night there, as it was difficult to find things my picky eater would enjoy. We found hamburgers but not hot dogs and almost never found mac and cheese or chicken tenders in London. There were many sandwiches shops on almost every street. We truly have no complaints about this lovely hotel, which is well maintained and staffed. The rooms were quiet and comfortable and nicely appointed. If you are an Underground user, the Grosvenor Marriott is mere steps away from the tube, while the JW is a 10 minute walk. We had also debated using St Pancras. It was connected to St Pancras and Kings Cross, eliminiating the need to walk outdoors, but the station is extremely large and would involve a good little walk as well. St Pancras has many sandwich and small sit down cafes indoors and two McDonalds are a few steps away. But we are glad we decided on the Park Lane location of the Grosvenor House instead, because its location was more central in town and closer to the sites we most wanted to see and the Tube lines that more quickly accessed more of the town.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frederiksberg, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel !\u201d", "Author": "UnTjus", "ReviewID": "UR125883410", "Content": "We stayed at Grosvenor House JW Marriott for 4 nights.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slightly less convenient for most things than the St Pancrass, or Renaissance on Holborn; but in terms of true elegance I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it can be beaten. The Grosvenor provides classical elegance, nothing tacky or ostentatious and not modern in terms of minimalist furniture or small square bathroom sinks. The staff at reception have always been helpful and the residents lounge is excellent serving: a good breakfast, afternoon tea, evening snacks and evening pre-dinner drinks including a full range of spirits, beers and champagne all complementary (note this is only for executive guests or Marriott Gold/Platinum members). My limited experience of the bar downstairs is good although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very expensive and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t serve draft beers, only bottles. The rooms are very comfortable with (as advertised on the website) marble bathroom suites and (not well documented) amazing showers which are almost powerful enough to blast the skin right off your body if turned up to full power. The beds are excellent and always provide a wonderful night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. The rest of the room is usual high quality hotel fare: large flat screen TV, document safe, fridge, desk, bathrobes, and even an umbrella in the wardrobe in case of rain. The only problem I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had with the Grosvenor House is ironically the address, Park lane is well known for being a nice part of town but isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ideally convenient for most things except for Hyde Park, the Embassies in Grosvenor Square, The Royal Albert Hall and West End shopping. The hotel is about half way between two tube stations (Marble Arch and Hyde Park Corner) each about 300m down the road; and is easily served by taxis which do make travel reasonable. That said there are better located hotels for sightseeing, and certainly for the east end of London e.g. The City/Canary Wharf.

To save time in seaching for other hotels on my London trip in future, I decided to book directly through the hotel web site for my 3 nights stay two months ahead of my arrival, hoping to make this hotel my choice of accommodation. In order to have a good rest, I decided to take the day flight instead of night flight. Upon my arrival at 9+pm at the hotel, we were allocated on the 1st floor room and I was absolutely disappointed with the room as the previous reviewer wrote, the room is really small with two 3' single bed joined together and with a thick wall outside the window and have very limited signal on my mobile & 3 internet dongle. Bathroom is small and a display of empty shower cap box (luckily I have a spare one in my toiletries bag and too tired to call for it). On the next morning I really cannot receive my call properly due to poor signal and I decided to ask for a room change as I told the receptionist that I did not want to make it my last stay at this hotel as I'm returning in March 2012, luckily she can allocate another room but told us to pack and leave our luggage in the room and they will bring our luggage to the new room upon our return. As we went out around 9am and returned from New Bond St (about 500+m walked) at 12:30noon all wet as me & my College daughter were caught in the rain without a room (previous room key returned), we waited for 15 min without anynews and I told the same receptionist again that we really need a room to change before we proceed to our next lunch appointment at The Metropolitan Hotel. We finally got another room with a street view on the same floor but have to transfer our own luggage. On the check out at 9am, we called for concierge twice to deliver our luggage down but ended up having to do it ourselves. The nearest tube is Marble Arch & Oxford Street shopping which is 643m away from the hotel, if you do not mind the walking distance than this is a good choice of hotel.

From the moment you walk in and see the gorgeous, HUGE flower arrangement in the lobby, you know you will be staying in a truly elegant place. The staff is very friendly and helpful and check in was easy. The rooms are beautifully appointed and large compared to the other two hotels we stayed in during this trip. The bed was comfortable and had really nice linens. I loved the closet area that had drawers AND shelves as well as an in-room safe. Let me tell you about my favorite- The Bathroom!. There is a large tub/shower combo and everything is marble but the best part is the dual shower heads- one regular sized hand-held (typical in England) and a fabulous, BIG waterfall above you (see my pics). Washing your hair after a long day walking for miles to see the sights is absolute HEAVEN and I am real picky about showers- especially water pressure. It was such a luxurious touch and you will LOVE it. The toiletries are nice and as in all the hotels we visited in England, there is a heated towel rack. There was only one thing that I was disappointed with- there are NO electrical outlets inside the bathroom.....HELLO??? don't the women in England do their hair ??. If you are like me and NEED a blow dryer and flat iron to even walk out the door without scaring people, you will be more than slightly annoyed by this. After my fabulous shower, I had to do hair at the desk- right next to the TV. Good thing my husband was in a pub at the time and didn't have to sit there listening to 1875 watts on High ! Like I said before- the room was lovely, comfortable, luxurious and quiet- so I forgive them this one small thing. I can only speak for the rooms on our floor (lower) and we had no view. Hotel Internet costs a fortune in London- go to the Pubs with free WiFi if you can. There is really nice gym and a few nice places to eat and drink within the hotel. I also loved seeing the info on the history of the place. If you stay here, keep in mind that this is a very upscale hotel. People are dressed WELL- do not go thinking that your ratty jeans and tennis shoes will be acceptable. In fact- one of the things I LOVED about London is that it's a very sophisticated city and everyone is well dressed, clean and elegant. Take nice stuff- even if you are just sight seeing. We were with a friend that was wearing jeans and tennis shoes and tried to go in the American Bar at The Savoy- no dice. If you do wear jeans- wear good ones and NICE shoes. The Grosvenor is located in a lovely neighborhood across from Hyde Park. You can walk, take The Tube or a taxi to anywhere you need to go quite easily. We loved taking the trains everywhere- I suggest getting a Day Pass- you can go anywhere, all day for one small fee. Be prepared to WALK but trust me- you will LOVE it .London is truly wonderful and if you want a really posh yet friendly experience- stay at Grosvenor and enjoy !

While under the Marriott name, the Grosvenor House has a a long rich history that the Marriott has preserved but incorporating Marriott's high customer service standards. This is an extremely large hotel, so if you prefer a boutique option, this is not the right place for you. If you are looking for a full service luxury hotel, located in a premier part of London but just enough off the tourist track to be comfortable, then this is a good option. The design and furnishings are very traditional which are appropriate for the architecture of the hotel, but I'm simply noting this if you prefer a contemporary option. The beds and sheets meet a Marriott/JW Marriot's high standards. Also, housekeeping was exceptional. Breakfast in the main restaurant is expensive (I believe close to $US 40 per person), but it is very good food with plenty of fresh fruits and other choices. Service was always reliable too. Also, they will make eggs to order, special toasts, or waffles and bring to your table if not served on the buffet and is included in the price. Breakfast was inclued in a package deal; otherwise, we may not have paid the price, but it was so filling, we never ate lunch. We had gold member access, so also frequented the Elite/gold member's lounge. I did stick my head in to see the lounge at breakfast and it seemed way too small for the size of the hotel. It felt very crowded and harried. It did have a few warm food options, but it was mostly fruit and breads, and did not seem as stocked as well as it should be. We also stopped for afternoon tea one day in the lounge. It was ok, but once again did not seem to be very well stocked. I dont think the hotel has set aside enough resources/space for the size of the hotel and likely number of gold members. Overall the staff was very nice and helpful, from the desk staff to bell staff to housekeepers to concierge. We would consider staying again or may try to the other Marriott at Park Lane which is slightly closer to the tube station, since Marriott has lots of West End London options.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, England", "Title": "\u201cClassy but pricey.

The door attendants opened our taxi doors & were very welcoming, getting our luggage out and offering to carry it inside for us. They also open the door for you everytime you leave/enter & are really friendly each time & ask if you need a taxi calling. The reception hall really is grand & smelled beautiful the whole time we were there. The lounge & bar areas were also tastefully decorated and very clean at all times. As were the toilets downstairs. I also thought the little shop was a nice touch & very handy. The location of the hotel is very good as we were staying for New Year & wanted to visit Hyde Park's Wonderland & go shopping. Park Lane is also a nice area to walk around so we felt safe there too. There weren't many staff on the reception & a couple managed to push in front of us at another desk which was a little annoying, it wouldn't have been better if the 2 staff they did have were on 1 desk so people could adhere to normal queuing practices. The lady who greeted us said our room wasn't ready yet (understandable, we were early) and that we could wait in the lounge we got with our Junior Suite until 3pm however, it was only 11am so we did not want to do this! We asked what sort of time the room could be ready as we wanted to go out for lunch & did not get an answer, just another description of the lounge & a point towards the lift! She told us to check-in in the lounge and did not offer to take our luggage from us until the room was ready (we presumed they would do this upstairs at this point). We carted all our stuff up to the lounge on the 7th floor only to find we needed a room key to get in which we didn't have! Had to knock for a while until a guest kindly let us in - we could have been anyone of the streets though! The lounge was quite small so not enough room for everyone to sit, we went to the check-in desk there & were still told we couldn't get in our room but they could call us when we could. We then had to drag all our luggage back downstairs to leave with the consierge while we left as we couldn't do this upstairs! They did however ring us whilst we were out to tell us the room was ready. When we got back to the hotel the consierge brought us our bags but no offer to take them to our suite, quite disappointing when we were paying \u00c2\u00a31200 for 2 nights stay! The room was quite nice, very clean & no problems but there were not tea/coffee amenities so we had to keep going up to floor 7 (from 5th) to our lounge to get free teas & coffees. The view wasn't good either, only looking at other buildings which again was disappointing for the price. On New Years Eve we sat in the lobby having drinks with some friends & a lovely Indian lady waited on us, unfortunately I didn't catch her name but she really was sweet. We watched the firworks at midnight along the Thames & came back to the bar afterwards for more drinks. We ordered some sandwiches at \u00c2\u00a316 each but were disappointed when brought us brown bread (we asked for white) and really salty fries after a 45 minute wait! It wasn't that busy either at 1.30am! Had they have been normal prices we wouldn't mind but we expected more for \u00c2\u00a316, we didn't complain though for fear of waiting another 45 minutes! The same lady waited on us still though & was as friendly and kind as earlier. The housekeeping staff were also great, our room was cleaned nicely and turned down at night. They were also polite when they passed us in the corridors. I have been to many nice hotels around the world including Dubai, New York & Paris so I wouldn't moan over nothing, just a little disappointed with some things considering the price paid for 2 nights - it was never going to be cheap I know but other hotels did have better rates. I would stay again so I hope these few problems can be rectified for the sake of others.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cThree nights in December, all good!\u201d", "Author": "Mary P", "ReviewID": "UR122284396", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here arriving on Boxing Day right after Christmas.

I was very disappointed by my stay. I travelled with my son of 11. We asked for a twin room. On arrival after a short wait at the reception we were given the keys to our room. It turned out to be a room suitable for wheelchair requirement/access guests. The red chords hanging down by the beds were a bit off putting but i guess needed for guests with special needs. However the bathroom didn't have a bath and the shower was suitable for a wheel chair to be rolled into. Personally I rarely shower and love to soak in a big tub. The room was also very dark and over looked a grim scene out of the window. So we asked to be moved. The next room seemed ok until the morning when the maids started working. The noise was incrediblly loud. We actually felt like they were in the room with us. We had a door in our bedroom which inter connected to the maids room. Again we asked to move. This time we had to pack everything up which was a bit of nuisance as we were missing out on fun times around London. The hotel did offer to move our bags so off we went out for the day. We got back and asked for new room keys. This time when we got to our room there were no twin beds just one king size. By this time we gave up and decided to stay. Given the bed was so big it wasn't so bad sharing but still I think it was poor service to not provide a twin room. The view from the room was also slightly better. However the lighting in the room was very dark. We made use of the executive lounge while we were there. This was also probably one of the worst exec lounges I've used. The food was ok but there was always a shortage of tables and seating. In addition the soft drinks in the coolers were nearly always warm as the fridges were too small for the stock needed. The ice bucket never had any ice. It was always melted. The staff in the lounge always looked miserable too. The hotel also felt incredibly un British apart from the two jolly door staff we met and had a chat with. I think they were Londoners. They made up for the fact the place was staffed mainly by people whose first language was not english. In fact they were a credit to the Marriott as they were so helpful getting us a taxi and ensuring we got in and out of it OK. They made the trip that little bit more special. However I think next time I will be staying at the Grosvenor Square Marriott. The trip was paid for on points and we did complain about the service and treatment to the management of the hotel upon our return. We did receive a letter of apology and 16% of the points we used to pay for the trip back.

Here are the highlights of our stay: 1. Location- The Grosvenor House was located on Park Lane, halfway between the Hyde Park and Oxford Street tube stops. I think it was slightly closer to the Oxford St. tube but it was a pleasant to walk through the streets of Mayfair to get to the shops on Piccadilly. We also liked the fact that we were near the Piccadilly line which we used to get to/from Heathrow. Hyde Park was just across the street. 2. Room- Our room was well appointed with all the usual features (flat screen tv, safe, minibar, umbrella, robe, slippers). There was a turn-down service each night and a complimentary Times newspaper was delivered daily to our door. There was also complimentary Hildon water left in the room each day. Last of all, I really appreciated the fact that the desk had a plug for American electrical items since I had forgotten to bring an adapter. 3. Wifi- There was high-speed internet access available for a charge but it was free for Marriott Platinum and Gold Elite members. 4. Service- Everyone we encountered at the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful. 5. Fitness Center- The Grosvenor House had a decent sized fitness facility which consisted 7 treadmills,some elliptical machines and a free weight area. 6. Executive Lounge- We had access to the 7th floor lounge during our stay and it was amazing. There was an enormous breakfast buffet from 6-10 am, tea in the afternoons and then happy hour in the evenings where a variety of beer, wine and heavy hors d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oeuvres (crudit\u00c3\u00a9s, cheese, empanadas, spring rolls, hummus, etc..) were served from 5:30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 8:00 pm. After that, I think there was a dessert buffet til 10 pm. Everything that we sampled was excellent. The only drawback to being in the lounge was the overwhelming number of families with small noisy children whose parents permitted them to run around and yell. However, we got around this simply by taking our food and beverages back to our room (blessedly quiet despite facing Park Lane).

We have always had a large room with a huge bed and have always been highly delighted with the service and facilities. This time I checked in on my own to be met by my husband later in the day and was given a room on the third floor, which I discovered had a standard 4' 6\" (small) double bed. We have a super king 6ft bed at home so a standard double feels very restricting compared to what we are used to. The hotel room was a good size and would easily fit a king size bed and having previous experience of the hotel and knowing that one night's b&b is \u00c2\u00a3282 (though we were not paying) I rang reception from the room and ask to change. I was told that the hotel was full and therefore this was not possible (even though it was only 3pm so obvious that not all rooms had been allocated). The girl told me she was responsible for room allocation so it was no good me asking to speak to anyone else. Also, I looked out of the window and saw a rooftop of noisy generators so, feeling fobbed off I decided to change tack and went in person to reception to ask for a quieter room. Sure enough it worked and I was allocated a room on the 8th floor which the receptionist assured me had a different aspect. When I got there I look out of the window and saw that it had the same aspect just a higher floor, and this time there was the added noise of generators from the roof (plus the same small bed).

Swanky address without the swanky pricetag. Overlooking Hyde Park, and ideally located for the famous shopping locations. Efficient check in, without a great deal of warmth, and unfortunately this seemed to be a theme throughout the weekend. Our room on the 8th floor was nicely decorated, and the marble bathroom was impressive. The room itself was small, but was fine for a couple of nights. Our room was to the side, so our view was across to the landmark of Battersea Power Station. Walked all weekend, which was a nice way to see some of the poshest parts of London, however the hotel is handy for the underground. We got a cab to the Apollo Victoria to see Wicked, and I think we were \u00c2\u00a310 one way including the tip. On Friday night we had a late reservation for Corrigans Mayfair, which although in the same building is actually outside and round the corner. Wow, was so relaxed for a high end restaurant, and amazing food and drinks, although very rich. Didn't bother with breakfast on Saturday morning as my husband had a shave booked at Trumpers in Curzon Street, but did venture in on Sunday.....wish we hadn't bothered. Remember my earlier comment about swanky price tags! Breakfast in the hotel is an expensive affair, which would be fine if it was reflected in the service or quality of food. My husband ordered porridge to be followed by eggs benedict, the waitress couldn't understand why you would want to, or manage to eat your porridge at the same time as your eggs, and my omlette was a sorry excude. On checking the bill we had been charged for a fruit juice which we didn't order. The host 'inspected' our table on the way past to have a very animated conversation with the waitress. Honestly after spending \u00c2\u00a350 on breakfast, I'm hardly likely to try to con an orange juice. My husband refused to pay the service charge, which was still on the bill when we checked out. Had afternoon tea in the Park Room on Sunday afternoon before leaving for the airport. Sat facing huge windows overlooking Park Lane, and across to Hyde Park. Felt most guilty scoffing my scones & clotted cream, while watching the personal trainers 'working' their clients in the park!

Check in was quick and we were welcomed by the guest relations manager personally. I am a Marriott Rewards Gold card member and we were upgraded to a Junior Suite on the executive floor (Level 7). The room was very spacious with a large 46\" TV in the lounge area and a smaller TV in the separate Bedroom area. The bathroom was also spacious and fully marble. There was a rain shower with a separate detachable head temperature & pressure were good. The room was in immaculate condition. We went to the executive lounge which is quiet and has room for about 20-30 people. There was complementary wine and beer with snacks - this was the first JW Marriott I have stayed in where there was complementary alcohol. When we got back to our room they had left a dozen chocolate dipped strawberries and a note to welcome us to the hotel on our special occasion - very nice touch. The bed was very comfortable and the room was really quiet all night, probably one of the most silent rooms I have ever stayed in - we live in the country and staying in the city normally upsets our sleep but not here! The staff were excellent during our stay from the concierge who helped us with West End theatre tickets to the Executive Lounge staff who were very attentive and pleasant, even the cleaning staff were courteous and pleasant which can be hard to find in London.

Then there was the girl minding the door on the backside of the hotel near the restaurant. She just stood there with her hands in her pocket looking at the ground. ONE TIME she actually opened the door when we were there, and that was when a gentlemen of Middle Eastern descent was walking ahead of us. She opened the door, he went through and as we followed behind she said \"Where are you going\" I said \"excuse me\", and she asked again \"Where are you going\".... We said \"To our room\" we are staying at this hotel.... (really strange). That actually happened twice over the course of 5 days.

The rooms are small. I understand that. But I'm staying in a 5 star hotel so I'm guessing they will make up for the lack of space. Not so much here. The public spaces: Gorgeous fresh flowers in the lobby. Polite employees at check in and they checked us in early thank goodness. The concierge was fine but not overly enthusiastic about her job. We did not eat in the restaurants but we did buy coffee every morning at their cafe since none is provided in the room. The coffee shop is fine, but provide neither a good deal nor an exceptional product. The room: The room is in fact quite small but was clean and pleasing to the eye. The bathroom is large and decked out in marble. The shower pressure was fine for us but the water wouldn't get hot, just warm. The wardrobe is small so if you're staying more than a couple of days, you will have to cram your clothing in or resign them to stay in the suitcase that will end up on the floor unless you're just bringing one. The bed was a huge disappointment. It was such that it sagged when you sat on it, like an old cheap mattress. The bedding and towels were fine, but far from luxurious, and not what I've come to expect from a J.W. Marriott. The prices here are kind of ridiculous, from the internet to the breakfast. If you want coffee in your room, plan to pay 6 pounds (per cup) for it. You get the idea. The Location: It is within walking distance of the Marble Arch Tube station, it's about 1/3 of a mile. If you've been on your feet all day, the walk gets old, especially in the rain. It is, however, just a few stops from where all the action is. The bottom line: When I pay for a 5 star hotel, I expect the place to be exceptional and the Grosvenor House failed to reach the bar.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cWell appointed rooms and great location but service is so-so\u201d", "Author": "BotRoad", "ReviewID": "UR119485721", "Content": "Rooms were very nice but smallish-bed was very comfortable-food was superior-great concierge lounge-no need to buy breakfast if you have access to concierge lounge.

I waited for hours, watching person after person checking in and getting their room with no problem. As it approached 3pm (check in time) my room still wasn't ready. I was told to go into the restaurant and they'd call me when it was ready. (At this point I was so tired, and really needed to get into my room to freshen up for a business meeting.) I went into the restaurant, paid about $50 US for a lite bite, came out after check in time, and room still wasn't ready. I had to quickly freshen up in the bathroom and check my bag as I needed to get to a business appointment. As a \"frequent traveller\" and loyal Marriott member, I was shocked my room wasn't ready.

Breakfast time was so packed (and one morning I went in early, one morning I went in later, and both days it was equally bad) there was no where to sit. There was no staff trying to help you find a place to sit. I stood around for awhile waiting for someone to get up but no one did. I finally found concierge level staff and asked where we were supposed to sit. She then opened up a extra room for sitting. As i settled in there with my purse/ipad, etc... I then went to get coffee, and a few items to eat. I found tons of others looking for a place to sit. I had to direct them to the room I was in so they'd have someone to sit. I was just surprised their staff wasn't more on this. All in all for $600 US plus a night, this is too much to pay for such bad service. You'd be better off just staying somewhere clean where you can get a room when you arrive, and then just go eat breakfast in a restaurant where you can get a table. I was so bummed to have such a bad experience this July when I had such a fabulous experience in March. I guess the story is if it isn't season - then it might be ok to stay here.

Our junior suite room had an odd layout because you walked into the bedroom before the living room. But the room was delightful with beautiful decoration. It was plenty of space for 3 adults. The king bed was humongous and the bed linens were sumptuous. I had the best sleep of my whirlwind vacation here after previously having slept at a Le Meridien and Hilton in other cities. The bathroom was very large, although we did not have a his & hers sink. The bath towels were thick and fluffy. Our room was on the 6th floor but we didn't have much of a view since it looked onto another building. Location: the hotel has a fantastic location in Mayfair on Park Lane. Hyde Park is across the street. The Marble Arch tube stop for the Central Line is 5 minutes away. Shopping on Oxford St and higher end boutiques on Bond St are also short walks away.

Very nice of them to do that, however if those two rooms are the same price I would be incredibly disappointed to have stayed in the small one the whole time. The JW Steakhouse is a great restaurant, and lunch and dinner service staff are friendly and the prices are actually reasonable.

I could have picked a bunch of other hotels, but having a corporate discount rate for this hotel helped :-) Made the price quite reasonable (especially for a top-of-the-line Marriott) and I earned Marriott Rewards points while I was at it. The hotel might be a bit pricey for those who are paying the rack rate! This hotel is near the Marble Arch Tube station and is very close to Oxford Street and all of the shopping that is on Oxford. The location is right by Hyde Park which is a very nice area too. It poured when we were there so we didn't get to explore the park much, but if you have luck with the weather, take advantage of the hotel's location and check out the park. The check-in process was pretty easy and the front desk was very nice. I asked nicely for a room upgrade and the lady found one for us. The room we ended up getting was HUGE and very nice. It had a very comfortable bed, plenty of space in the room, a nicely appointed bathroom, and cozy bathrobes. The TV was a little small for the size of the room, but acceptable. The hotel features an evening turn-down service as well, which is very nice. Definitely gives the feel that this is a high-end hotel, which it definitely was. We did not eat at the hotel, but definitely check out the cafe on the bottom floor. They have a cheesecake that is to die for. I've had a lot of cheesecakes in my time, and this was definitely one of the best. The graham cracker crust was done perfectly. Skip the coffee though - it was kind of bland. There is a Starbucks about a 10 minute walk away (on the corner of Green Street and N. Audley Street) which will probably be better. :) I also used the theater ticket booking service on the ground floor. It is operated by a separate company. They were able to get us great seats to a showing of Wicked. They do add a service charge (which they do NOT disclose) to the ticket fee, so if you want to save some money, go directly to the theater to buy the tickets. Not knowing this (and not wanting to drag myself to the Apollo Victoria Theater), I bought the tickets there. Overall, a great hotel.

Although I'd visited the capital many times with work etc, I'd never done the 'touristy bit' and so I decided to treat my wife and son to a relaxing Christmas break and splashed out on the Grosvenor House as part of a Theatre / City break. Situation is perfect for sightseeing, shopping or a just walk in the Park. The Grosvenor is a lovely place to stay, well appointed, upper class for sure, but very relaxing and with all the facilities you could wish for. The rooms are large and comfortable but be careful. I'd asked for a room opposite Hyde Park, for the view, but found it a bit noisy, so after one night I asked for a quiet room and was pleased to see that when we arrived back from an afternoon out, we had been moved to an inside room. Not much of a view, but a more peaceful night. The breakfast is the usual quality hotel fare, all well cooked and with a vast array that is just too tempting. I don't usually eat a large breakfast, but the food just will not be ignored. The staff were all very helpful and polite, the room change was handled superbly, they even moved our clothes and stuff whilst we were out, without being asked. Nice touch. Without doubt, the Grosvenor is expensive, but with a bit of browsing, deals are available and we felt that the hotel was well worth the price we paid. The drink prices in the Red Bar are quite steep, as is the norm in a hotel of this calibre, however, there is a great pub just a few yards from the hotels 'back door' where prices are more moderate and they serve good English beer. We didn't get around to sampling all the choices of eateries in the hotel, but did have a wonderful evening in the Steakhouse. The food is truly memorable and although expensive, we thought the whole evening well worth it. Try the 'on the bone' Rib Eye but bring a good appetite with you. So, a lovely classy hotel, but at a premium price. Worth saving up for though.

Right after this hotel - I moved to the Landmark Hotel - you walk in and smell fresh flowers (also a much nicer hotel). This hotel smelled like someone bought cheap perfume and sprayed it everywhere. It was overpowering. The other guests noticed as on a couple of occasions, others in the lobby were discussing it. The second issue with the hotel came on the day of checkout. At 1106am I was in my room packing. Suddenly, the TV comes on an starts blaring the sound of an alarm at an ever increasingly loud volume. At first, I thought it was a fire alarm. But the message on the screen said that I had a message - that checkout was at 12pm. I was taken aback by the rudeness of the message. It was an hour before checkout and the hotel thought it a good idea to blare at top volume an alarm? Who runs this place. But they weren't done. 10 minutes later - the TV started blaring again - once again giving me a message that checkout was at 12pm. I stay at hotels at least 15 weeks a year.

The lounge is open on weekends, as well as weekdays, with various food and snack services throughout the day. The service is outstanding! The \"fitness suite\" is above average. I've seen much worse in my travels with Marriott, even at JW's. There are plenty of machines, free weights, and a good amount of floor space. There are pubs and eateries nearby, and all of London is easily accessed on foot, by tube, or in taxis. London is expensive, perhaps on the same order as NYC for the cost of hotel room.

The room was very spacious with a lovely large bathroom. I have put pictures here of the room and the view from it. I only breakfasted at the hotel so cannot really comment on the restaurants or the food. The breakfast was buffet style and I only ate some yoghurt, fruit and toast, but there seemed to be a lot of other options. One negative was the fact that there was not a kettle for making tea (or a coffee brewere) in the room. I know that a lot of 5 star hotels like to say that they are too posh to offer such a thing. That all you need to do is to ring and they will be more than glad to bring you a cup of tea. Well, I very much like to have a cup of tea in the morning while still not dressed and don't really feel comfortable having room service coming in, nevermind the cost and tipping. So, if I could make one recommendation, it would be for the hotel to reconsider their position on the electric kettles. The best bit about my stay was the concierge. I had arrived from the States with two gifts for family and a friend living in the UK, that I wanted to send off. I really didn't want to cart them around for any longer than necessary. They were two small grafted Japanese maple trees from my husbands garden nursery. We had wrapped the roots in damp newspaper and plastic before I left Maine. So, I went down to the desk in the late afternoon and placed the two trees on the desk inquiring if the concierge could help me get these sent off to Scotland and Herefordshire. He didn't bat an eye. \"Of course, ma'am, what is your room number? Just leave them with me.\" After returning from dinner I went to the desk to see how it had gone and he said they were all set, that he had carefully wrapped them, boxed them and had them taken for posting. He then inquired about the variety, telling me that he had grown Japanese Maples himself at one time. It was just a nice experience and I felt good knowing that my trees had been well taken care of. I had not chosen this hotel, I was staying there as part of a small group, and while I would recommend the hotel for people who have a generous budget, there are other hotels in London in the same price range that I personally would prefer.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cEat breakfast out\u201d", "Author": "businesstraveler056", "ReviewID": "UR101414418", "Content": "Room service for breakfast was a disappointment. Pastries tasted stale; eggs were cold and runny. After the first morning, I ate breakfast out. I was right to be skeptical about 5 star boasting on the hotel's website. How often is any Marriott (outside of their Ritz-Carlton line) ever really five star? Service was adequate and professional and followed a Marriott formula, but was in no way personal. As an example, I arrived with colleagues who were of course staying in separate rooms, and bell staff grouped all of our bags together - highly effecient (typically Marriott), but impersonal (also, typically Marriott). Neighborhood is nice, though the hotel is not particularly well located within the neighborhood, so a walk to a good neighborhood restaurant is easily 15 minutes. The intelligent construction of the hotel where it is set back from the street is a real plus for those of us who like a quiet room. The hotel has a very large and well known ballroom which is popular for mid range events, so expect continuous foot traffice through the hotel lobby. I observed no royalty, celebrities or business leaders (as boasted on the hotel's website) attending these events, but it was certainly not a bad crowd of people either. Room was quiet, clean and comfortable; bathroom was nice by Marriott standards -- 4 star, not 5. In public areas on my floor, there was a musty smell which made me feel that the hotel is in need of a renovation, notwithstanding the one recently completed, per to the hotel's website. A surprise on the upside was the terrific dinner at the hotel's steak restaurant, which is nicely laid out and serves high quality food. Overall, my stay was comfortable, and I might return if I needed to be in Mayfair. I would just go with proper expectations: 3 star lobby service, 4 star room, 5 star steakhouse and 1 star room service.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with old world charm\u201d", "Author": "cwuer", "ReviewID": "UR101397118", "Content": "Stayed 2 nights here and was impressed with the old word charm of this hotel. Our cab driver was not familiar with the hotel at first as we were apparently not pronouncing the word Grosvenor correctly and the JW Marriott part completely threw him off. If you mention the word Marriott to the cab drivers they immediate think you are talking about the Marriott on Park line. Just call it the Grosvenor House (pronouncer Grovenor, the s is silent) leave off the JW Marriott part or you will confuse them. When we walked into the lobby it is large, open and inviting with an old world charm to it. There was a line at reception and we waited about 10 minutes to check in. The receptionist was very friendly and being Gold members were given a room on the executive floor although we only booked a standard room. The room was HUGE, and I mean even by American standards. There was no view, but coming from our previous hotel it would have paled in comparison anyway, so was not a disappoint to us. The bathroom was equally as large with beautiful black and white marble floors. The bed was extremely plush and comfortable. While the lobby atmosphere was lively and hectic the room itself was very quiet with excellent soundproofing. We had access to the executive lounge and the staff there were extremely pleasant as well as helpful. Juliet even went so far as to go online and try to help us find theater tickets, which is certainly outside the scope of her job. The happy hour had complimentary alcohol, beer, wine, and hors d'oeuvres. The breakfast was OK, mostly continental with some poorly cooked scrambled eggs thrown in, but as it is complimentary I can't complain. What made this longue so special was definitely the friendly staff. The only thing about this property that I did not like was it's distance from the tube. While it may not seem far if you are not walking a lot throughout the day, it seems a long haul when you have been sight seeing all day. We dreaded the walk to and from the tube stop each time we had to make it. While certainly within walking distance it is about a 10 minute brisk walk each way. We were sure wishing there had been those little rickshaw's about to give us a ride back and forth, but never saw any at this location. That really is my only complaint about this hotel and certainly not a reason to keep me from recommending. Location of the hotel otherwise is very good, close to many of the tourist attractions. We did not eat in the restaurants as we had use of the longue. One thing to be aware of is to be very cautions in using the concierge to book theater tickets. We really wanted to see Les Miserable while we were there and were willing to pay a little more for the convenience of having the concierge book tickets for us. We went down one morning and after a quick phone call were told the show was completely sold out but that he could get us good tickets for 109 pounds each. We decided to pass as we knew the most expensive tickets at the box officer were 60 pounds. He told us the show was sold out except for obstructed view tickets for the whole weekend. We were told by someone outside the hotel not to trust what the concierge told us and to go to the box office directly and inquire. We did that and were able to get good seats for about 40 pounds. I do not mind paying extra for the convenience of having a concierge book my tickets but he blatantly lied to us and this kind of markup on tickets is exorbitant. As we were trying to purchase several tickets even at the most expensive tickets he was looking to make about 250 pounds profit on the deal. This leaves a very bad taste in my mouth and I just want to warn others to use caution when looking to book theater tickets from this concierge and don't believe him if he tells you it is sold out.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the money- a terrible experience\u201d", "Author": "RaDay", "ReviewID": "UR100209430", "Content": "My partner and I were in London together last summer - he working, me visiting family and vacationing. We only stayed a few nights at the Grosvenor House because we were so disappointed and frustrated with it that we moved. We had expected a top-quality, elegant, London hotel with exceptional customer care. What we found was a hotel with staff who didn't seem to care, terrible decor, bad lighting and worse rooms. Ok, so decor is personal taste - but the rooms were garish and badly appointed. They weren't big enough for the size of the furniture or to handle the colour scheme (I felt totally overwhelmed by the bright colours and bold prints and there was only a few foot of space around the bed to move in.) There was next to no closet space. With two of us there, we genuinely couldn't find space to put our clothes (we weren't asking to keep a store-full there, just two week's of clothing for two) or to keep our bags there without falling over them. They offered to store our bags, but then what should we have done with our clothes? Leave them on the chairs? The bathrooms there were small and non-memorable. I never got to see their pool/spa - it was closed while we were there. Worst of all was the view. We had an inner courtyard room. The \"view\" was of a series of air ducts, bits of construction debris and rubbish. It was awful. I wasn't necessarily expecting a view over the park, but this was tragic. When we complained, they offered us a room on a lower floor with the same view. Odd. The staff member who came to show us the new room said something to the effect of \"When I first started, a customer complained because there was a dead pigeon out there, at least that's not there now.\" We declined the other room and asked them to see if something else came available. After countless conversations about a room change, they finally made one available to us with a street view on our second day. Actually, it looked out over the street and a part of the roof below where bits of rubbish and cigarette butts had collected. Not what you like to see just a few feet from your window. The move itself took forever. Having been told someone was on their way, I ended up waiting in the hallway for almost 45 minutes because housekeeping insisted on cleaning just then and there was literally nowhere for me to stand or sit in the room while she did. Eventually a maintenance man working on the room opposite called front desk for me (twice) to get someone to come up and help me move. We stayed one more night, on a bed that made my arms go numb, and then moved to a new hotel. While they were apologetic about our experience they also promised we'd hear from them by mail and we never did. I can't imagine why anyone would think this kind of experience worth the sort of money they charge for a room.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hemel Hempstead, UK", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SubaruDriver", "ReviewID": "UR99917485", "Content": "Stayed in a room that had it's own living area with sofa and chairs as well as TV, and 2 bathrooms.

(I thought the woman who checked us in said it was free in the lounge.) If my daughter and I had use the internet there, it would have been another 20 pounds -- each. That really adds up. I'm an elite Marriot Rewards member, and usually I get free internet access, but not here. The room was nice, but our view was not. Beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was nice. The hair dryer did not work, and there was no in-room coffee maker. My wife and daughter got room service one night, and they said the food came quickly and was good. The fitness room was good, but (again) not great. There were five treadmills there, but two were broken.

I generally ignore all positive feedback on here because I assume the hotel is writing it. I thus look for negative reviews and see if there is a common theme. The common theme I found about this hotel was that the service sucked. We generally did NOT have bad service. We got there and had a queen size bed. They wanted \u00c2\u00a330 per night for a king size delux room.....I was REALLY nice and asked if we could have it free since the hotel wasn't full. They finally said okay. We were on the 6th floor. The view wasn't great but we didn't care. The room was decent size. Great marble bathroom. Location: pretty good. Easy walk to marble arch. this hotel has as good a location as any for all of the sites. However, if you plan to be in soho a lot, then keep in mind that after clubbing you have to pay a \u00c2\u00a310 cab ride to get back and/or walk 30 mins to the hotel....not a big deal if you ask me. My one gripe: Internet cost \u00c2\u00a320 per day which is RIDICULOUS! I refused to pay this so I went to a vodaphone store (there are a few on oxford street which is the same street the marble arch underground station is on) and got a sim card for my unlocked iPhone. The sim card cost \u00c2\u00a35 but came with \u00c2\u00a35 in credit. For \u00c2\u00a35 you can get 250mb of internet to use for a month!!! If you go over it is only 50p a day for 25 more MBs. I tethered my iphone to my computer and thus had internet for \u00c2\u00a35 TOTAL rather than paying \u00c2\u00a320 per night. Also, t-mobile sells a USB wireless modem for \u00c2\u00a320 that you can plug into ANY laptop. For the \u00c2\u00a320 you get the USB stick, and one month to use 3 GIGs of internet on your computer! I'm sure the other mobile phone stores have similar deals. My suggestion is to NOT spend \u00c2\u00a320 per night on internet and use one of these other options. Service: never had room service or had any problems. The only time we called the front desk was to get a new do not disturb sign since ours was missing. They came within 5 mins which met my expectations. The maids came twice a day (the second time to turn down the bed)...and they cleaned the room well. For two days they were fixing hot water....the hot water was shut off in the middle of the day for a few hours. No big deal but I'm sure if I was paying full rate and complained enough they would have done something. As it was I didn't complain....weird though that they chose to do repairs during the middle of the day rather than in the middle of the night. Overall, I would recommend this hotel and stay here again. I would never purchase internet for \u00c2\u00a320 a night though. In addition, if I was going to pay full price, I'd stay at the renaissance chancery court because for ME, the location was a little better (I was out very late in soho every night).", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best hotels - but the service ...\u201d", "Author": "Censuwine", "ReviewID": "UR79302655", "Content": "I won't write at length about the quality of this hotel. It is up there with the best of them and everything about it is top notch stuff. However, in common with many London Hotels, management does not seem to invest too heavily in staff development and general upgrading of language skills. I would like to mention two incidents in particular: 1) Check in for three people took 32 minutes and the girl insisting in registering us as Portuguese despite asking for our passports. The rooms reserved were King/Queen/Large Twin. By the time of check in (circa 1 pm) we were told that only one room was available (I believe it was Room 573, possibly the most claustrophic place in London). On drawing the attention of the receptionist that we had booked higher quality rooms she said ... what for it ... here it comes: \"Wait until 3pm and you might be able to try to change the room\". Wow! How's that for a non-committal answer? She must be given every encouragement to pursue a career in the diplomatic service. Eventually, the Manager was summoned and the three rooms made available more than satisfied our expectations. 2) The hotel had some problems with hot water supply (6/7 September 2010) and the management left a note in each room explaining the situation to its clients. Apparently, the problem was solved and staff were given instructions to retrieve the note from each room. On the second floor, a member of staff barged her way into the rooms allowing the best part of 1 nanosecond between her knock and opening the door.

My major complaint was the service, due to an amazing issue with an airport pick up. We booked a Mecedes car with the Concierge to collect our Client from Heathrow, and the car basically got bored waiting and went home. We then had to deal with an angry Client who, like us, had flown from China to attend a meeting with us in London. This soured the first meeting when they finally arrived and basicly ruined the trip.

I have stayed here every time I\u00c2\u00b4ve been to London for 10-15 years, but no more! The three last stayes have been very disappointing, and despite of the staffs promises to \"have their manager call me after the weekend\", I have never heard anything from them again. The first time this happened, I thought there had been a mistake, but after three occurences of the same issues, I have resorted to changing hotel. When I asked for something, I had to remind the staff several times before the problems were fixed. I will not list all problems, as I don\u00c2\u00b4t have the time, but here are a few of them: My fiance and I asked for separate duvays at our arrival at the hotel in the morning. *The following evening, we asked again. The following morning we asked again, and four eight later they had still not acomplished to change them and we gave up. * I delivered a blouse for cleaning and specified \"no ironing\" on the label. The blouse was ironed and ruined, but they still hang it on my door withour even mentioning that they had ruined it. When I noticed, they appologised but did nothing about it. I asked to speak to the manager, they told me that he would call me after the weekend but he never did. *I became ill at one time when I was there, and called housekeeping to get some extra towels. I waited three hours and called four times to remind them. Finally, I had to get dressed and go to the reception myself to get the towels. *Some of the rooms are very small and some of the so-called double beds are only one and a half bed. I have stayed in connecting rooms, suites and normal single- and double-rooms and the quality is very varying within each booking category. If you are so unfourtunate to have to stay at this hotel, make sure you get everything fixed while you are there and don\u00c2\u00b4t believe the staff if they say they will have someone call you - it will never happen!

I had bought the room at a discounted rate, from a third party seller, Travelrepublic. I have bought many rooms through this site and have never had a problem before. I was told by reservations that I had not paid enough for my room to be able to choose a view. Very nice response, I did not think, certainly did not make me feel a valued guest. I did at least confirm that my booking was correct and when I was due to arrive. On arrival at the Hotel, my booking did not exist, they had lost lost my booking. I was told that the failure was down to the travel site I booked with and should have booked with Marriott direct. The receptionist called travelrepublic a 2 bit organisation who dont know what they are doing. I have booked a number of hotels through this site and have had no problems before. They had me arriving on the 1st October, yet my booking was for May. They argued with me, even though I had the accommodation voucher stating the correct dates. I was told that travelrepublic must have filed the dates wrongly. I pointed out to the receptionist that I had called the Hotel the week before and all dates were confirmed as being OK. He even argued with me and told me I had not called the Hotel. I was treated in an abysmal way by the Receptionist because yet again and I quote \"I had not paid enough for the room and I had booked it through a third party\". I am sorry, but if someone at this Hotel, makes a decision to sell a room at a certain price, should I be penalised for buying it? The simple answer to this is NO! The receptionist made several phone calls and after 20 minutes admitted the error was the Hotels not mine or Travelrepublics but gave No apology. We were not given a coffee while we waited, no recompense, nothing whilst we waited. Very very disappointing. Not what you would expect for a Hotel of this nature. The room was OK but complete;y soulless. Red walls, strange corridor wall paper, nice bedroom and comfy bed......and in the end wonderful views of the park. The bathroom and shower unit were not the best. Turn down service was just that, they turned the bed down. No gift, no slippers, no mat. We are talking a top 5 star property and a 3 room suite and nothing but a sheet turn down. For me, a 5 star experience begins and ends with the small things, that 4 star hotels don't give. This hotel does not know where to start with customer service, never mind the small touches. At breakfast, I was not asked if I required toast or coffee. I was ignored by staff who were too busy talking to themselves or by managers who were busy talking to other managers or by managers introducing guests to the managers. I was sat on my own with no service. I had to ask for both coffee and toast. While waiting for my toast, a manager in a suit came over and without saying anything removed my plate of jams, whilst I was sat at the table. He lent over me without saying excuse me and took my jam and honey, unbelievably rude. Can you imagine this happening at a top USA Marriott or in the Far East. This abysmal service could only happen in a London Hotel. I had to get up and ask for them back. I needed some information, so went to the Concierge. The prevailing could not care less about guests attitude, was even here. I asked for some information, but was served as he was also dealing with another guest. He went to google, did a search and printed off some material, that did not match what I had asked for. He could not care less. I felt like a second class citizen at this hotel. reading other reviews about this hotel, I am not the first to be dealt with in this manner. The hotel is trading from its name and former reputation. I highly rate the Chesterfield in Mayfair. I recommend anyone thinking of booking this snob ridden ignorantly staffed hotel, to book the far superior Chesterfield, which is usually cheaper, where they know how to treat any guest. I am still looking for a London 5 star property that can match for service the Hotels I have stayed in in the USA, EU and Far East...my search continues.

A few days before we arrived we had the usual email from the concierge asking if we had any special requests, which is always a nice touch and more importantly they really do take note. We arrived mid afternoon to check in. Now we really do love this hotel and will have no hesitation in staying there again, but they really do need to get their act together with regard to check in as exactly the same procedure has happened to us now on both occasions. There was a very small queue at reception when we arrived. Reception staff appear to disappear at the drop of a hat and some people were just walking straight up to the desk, ignoring those of us waiting. The splendid and efficient doormen noticed this and were quick to show us to a vacant desk and summon a receptionist from somewhere behind the scenes! Said receptionist was not at all happy, no smile, no welcome, just let's get on with it sort of attitude. The immortal words were then uttered.....your room is not ready at the moment, but if you would care to wait in the lounge area we will ring you when it is....same as last time! So we retired to the lounge and ordered a drink....it was 3pm. By 3.30pm still no word from reception and by now the queue for check in was almost out of the doors. I went to the concierge desk and asked if she could assist. Call to reception....yes our room was ready and if we would like to go back to reception they would complete check in. I informed her that l was not prepared to queue again. Concierge asks me to return to the lounge and she will sort it out. 3.50pm and we are still waiting so l again approach the concierge, this time with a serious complaint about the service. This complaint worked and a lovely lady came over to us, took DH orff to complete check in ( to the utter dismay of all still in the queue!) and profusely apologised for the cock up! Anyway, that was my wee niggle and l do hope that management will get this problem sorted out as it really is a pain and not a good start. Our room was just lovely, very spacious and immaculate. We had mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and a bottle of champagne was on ice for us, compliments of the hotel.Thank you. I have noted that some complain about rooms not having a view. This is an old hotel, with a very rich history. We don't expect a 'view' in London, unless of course one pays for a top suite with views of Hyde Park, which for most of us is not important as we only sleep there. Talking of which, the beds here are the most comfortable we have ever slept in and considering the location, we found the room very quiet. There was a star studded function on here in the Great Room on the Sunday night and we didn't hear a thing. In room tea and coffee facilities are useful, but how nice it was to ring room service and have morning tea brought to the room with the option of having it poured for you. Ok it's not cheap, but we didn't consider it expensive either. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel. Just a short walk away there is a lovely little Mayfair cafe that offers great choices for this at half the price. In fact, if you wander around Mayfair you can come across some delightful places to eat. We wandered down to the Shepherds Market area one morning, which is just behind the London Hilton on Park Lane. It's a different world, where you can get pub grub and a great London welcome away from the five star hustle and bustle at reasonable prices, with a cart load of history to boot. As other reviews have mentioned, the Grosvenor is ideally situated for Oxford Street, Knightsbridge and a whole host of major attractions. Just get out there and walk, it's surprising what one can discover. So then, to get back to the Grosvenor. All in all yet another lovely weekend which we really enjoyed. Will we stay there again? Damn right we will.....in conclusion, l have to mention a certain doorman by the name of Carl, who knows his job inside out, just take the time to converse with him, guys like him really do know it all, and are willing to share.

Because service is \"individual\", i.e., depending upon the person providing the service, one may receive service anywhere from horribly rude to perfectly perfect - I wouldn't fault the hotel. The other reviews are true - I experienced the full range - but, keep things in perspective. Because I travelled so much and met so many people, I can't remember the names of the staff that were awesome - perfect in service, tasteful in behavior, polished is their own sense of self-respect: A lovely Polish gal who serves in the restaurant in the morning, and a French gal at the front desk...Corrine?

They were naturally splendid in providing the 5 star service expected in such a hotel. Their service was so superb, it overwhelmed the few folks who shouldn't be employed in the service industry - but could better be served sitting at a computer performing data entry.

Selfridges and Bond Strets designer stores (10 min walk) Harrods is 10 minutes taxi ride in the opposite direction.

It is nevertheless a very conservative hotel and probably not recommended for under 30s unless your priority is luxury and comfort. The concierge are very helpful and always on standby to help but sometimes the lobby can get very hectic as many black tie pre-events for the Grand Ballroom next door are often held at the Grosvenor. Always a chance to dress up in the evening albeit in very formal dress. There was a brasserie in the hotel when we were there with very atmospheric dark oak decor and beautifully tiled floor but unfortunately the food was not always consistently good. The restaurant has since changed. Now for some less preferred points. The gym is completely lacking in any proper equipment or accessories required for this kind of hotel. We were told the spa was being refurbished and due to open in 2010 but at the time of writing this it is still not complete and the gym is as it was then. The hotel is situated on one of the busiest roads of central london. The good thing of this is its always easy to hail a london taxi. But if you sit on the terrace for a drink in summertime you might find some exhaust fumes mixing with your beverage. All in all I would recommend this for a stay where you are not looking for lots of excitement but perhaps shopping/ business meetings in the day and getting some solid rest/ sleep at night.

The water pressure could have been better and the water was warm at best, but it was very pretty. The king-sized bed was comfortable and warm and we took full advantage of the flat-screen TV in our quiet room. There were two free (small) bottles of water provided in the bathroom, as well as shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, soap and bath salts. The room also contained bathrobes and disposable slippers. An umbrella, iron and ironing board were in the main closet and the safe was in the side closet. The service in the Bordeaux for breakfast was awful. We had a terrible time just getting into the restaurant, as there was confusion on whether breakfast was included in our rate. We were turned away and had to go back to reception, which I thought was poor for a 5-star hotel. We watched another guest encounter a similar problem (when we were finally seated), which again, I did not find appropriate for a 5-star property. We were misinformed by our server about the breakfast choices and it was very, very slow. Food was okay, but poor value for money and the buffet area suffered from over-crowding. It always amazes me that 5-star hotels never have free WIFI or a kettle in the room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid the Grosvenor House can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rest on its laurels and the management needs to take a serious look at the service at this hotel. However, it is a beautiful property with an amazing history.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cVery glamorous but slightly disappointed\u201d", "Author": "mrsjofus", "ReviewID": "UR54736981", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights here for New Year recently and the hotel itself is beautiful - very glamorous downstairs in the foyer and bar areas.

They gave very helpful suggestions for our ten day stay in London. The hotel is located in central London several blocks (about a 10 minute walk) to the Marble Arch underground tube station. We purchased a one week pass which was about 25 GBP per person Oyster Pass for Zones 1 and 2 which you can ride on the buses and subways unlimited. We used Prime Car, which is a private car service from Heathrow Airport to the hotel, which was about a 25 minute ride to the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Hotel at a rate of 35 GPB, much cheaper than using the regular cabs upon recommendation from a relative who lives here. I went on Priceline.com to book this hotel and stayed from December 24th through January 3rd, a period of ten nights and had an excellent rate of $170 US Dollars per night plus taxes on Priceline, which was less than half of what rooms were going for on Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website at the time I had booked it. This is considered to be a five star hotel. We were given a nonsmoking king room on the eighth floor, which had a partial view of the park across the street. The bathrooms were adorned in gorgeous black and white marble. There was a bathtub which included bath salts. There were two shower heads, which included an optional mounted handheld and another one which had a rainshower type effect. Water pressure was great, very plentiful. The sink had great hot and cold water with good water pressure. Amenitites included daily shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, vanity kit and shower cap. There were also two bottles per day of free bottled water provided in the bathroom. There was a toilet as well as a bidet. Comfy soft white robes were provided along with white slippers. There was a separate heater in the bathroom which could be turned up or down for optimal comfort. There was a rack with towel warmers. We were disappointed that our towel warmer did not work. There was a scale in the bathroom as well. Overall we were very pleased with the bathroom and the cleanliness. The only thing was that five days out of ten the maid failed to provide washcloths and we had to keep calling down for them. Aside from that, housekeeping did an outstanding job. Our room had a comfortable king bed. Feather or foam pillows are available upon request. The sheets and comforter were very comfortable. There was turndown service each evening but no chocolates provided on the bed. Closet space could have been a little more plentiful, but we managed just fine. Laundry/dry cleaning service was available for extra charges. We were very upset that internet service was not included and cost 20GBP extra per day which was outrageously expensive. There was no free internet in the lobby area either. There was a coffee shop where you could get coffee, tea, juice, crossiants, muffins, etc. There was a full service restaurant Bordeaux which was very expensive. A cheeseburger cost $16.50GPB which could be had elsewhere for less than half that price. There was another restaurant/lounge area called Park Room, which also served afternoon tea. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at all in the hotel restaurants because they were outrageously expensive. Room service and the mini bar were also very high priced and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use those services either. There is a front and back entrance to the hotel. We came and went several times per day. 75% of the time the door men didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say hello to us or greet us but just stood at the door staring off into space and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open the doors for us even when they saw us approaching. For a five star hotel, I thought this was very rude as I am used to door men being courteous and friendly by greeting the hotel patrons and also opening the doors for them. We experienced this from several different door men, not just one so this was representative behavior over ten days. Also, the first two days we had a smell of smoke in our room because the people next door to us were smoking in a nonsmoking room. We reported this to security who took care of the situation. After that, we did not smell any further smoke. Rooms were very quiet. We had a nice flat screen TV in the room. The closet had an umbrella, just in case you forgot to bring one. There was also a shoe care kit available in the closet as well as a mini sewing kit which came in handy when a button from my jacket came off and I had to sew it back on. There was climate control on the wall so you can select optimal temperature for your room. We had a nice quiet pleasant stay and slept very well each evening. There is also a theater desk downstairs where you can book shows. My husband and I saw several shows in London but I had booked them well in advance myself on the internet. There was free coffee and tea downstairs in the lobby each morning with mugs and takeaway cups.

Marriott's renovation was superb, the hotel is clean, feels warm and relaxing and is superbly positioned in central London, squarely between the placid, clean, village-like atmosphere of the expensive streets east of Park Lane and the massive green spaces of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. The basic rooms are beautifully laid out, spacious enough - this is London, not Vegas, and a hotel should be a refuge, not a bunker - and well equipped with Marriott's standard kit : in-room safes, big televisions, cupboard space, marble bathrooms, irons and so on. The public areas are also welcoming, particularly the 'library' and the Red Bar, and the staff are thoroughly professional. Better to arrive in the courtyard on Park Street, rather than at the back door on Park Lane, which would force you to traipse the length of the ground floor to check in; not all taxi drivers are aware of the distinction, and probably very few care. The downsides are relatively trivial and not all of the chain's making; given the limitations of such an old building and the need to secure its prime position on Park Lane, they've done a superb job. However, the building is as maze-like as previous reviewers have alluded to; I had room 250, which was two dog-legs from an elevator, and because of its position quite dark - it overlooks the flat roof between the towers, and a sliver of Park Lane, as must several dozen others, so if a view is essential to you, ask for one. The bigger issue is the cost of the ancillaries, which matters more now than it ever did, whether you're a business traveller or a tourist. Still no free wifi; in-room connection, or surf and print in the business centre at \u00c2\u00a33 per 15 minutes (behind reception; good luck getting there without swapping maps with Indiana Jones). Lovely as the place is, this is prime London real estate and a luxury business hotel, so a full English breakfast will set you back \u00c2\u00a327.50 a head, a bowl of soup at least \u00c2\u00a37.50 - somehow I managed to avoid the \u00c2\u00a310 bowl - and an alcohol-free two course dinner for two in Bord'Eaux, the attached restaurant, never ducked under \u00c2\u00a360.

Other things that were sub-par were mold in my shower on the ceiling. The light fixtures in the bathroom were filthy. The key failed for access to the lounge and were finicky when they were used to open the room. The Fire Alarm went off in the middle of the night -one night -for no reason? (it turned off after 3 minutes.) They say they have a gym.... Technically they do, it is probably one of the WORST gyms I have ever seen -it literally consists of 5 cardio machines -no crosstrainers, and some weights. Overall for a JW (supposed to be the top of the Marriott Line) -I found the stay just satisfactory. Little things that I would expect to be effortless for this property -it struggled with. The Lounge never changed its offerings for meals, the turn down service was offered but didn't provide a chocolate. The bathroom had mold and the light fixtures were very dirty. The internet in the room was 20 pounds for 24 hours. The iron incident was really annoying as was the gym experience. But the Hotel has a great location, and was quiet and comfortable.

There lobby had beautiful chandeliers and floral displays with a classy appeal to it. After we received our room keys we went to our room. However we were not offer luggage assistance. I was a bit surprised not see any bell hops in sight considering the class of this hotel. We found the room impressive based on the size, d\u00c3\u00a9cor, and cleanliness.

Be sure to advantage of this service. The hotel is near Marble Arch and Hyde Park. You will find many shops and Lebanese restaurants. Hyde Park is just a few minutes walk and a great place to relax and get away from the busy city.

W. Marriott and had mixed expectations. My last visit was pre- refirbishment and the rooms were looking tired and dated but it still offered excellent service standards and a fanstastic central location. I booked a one night stay via priceline.co.uk, and paid \u00c2\u00a3116inc taxes/charges but excluding breakfast. I emailed the hotel to request a non smoking room and upon arrival we were allocated one without question. Our taxi dropped us on Park Lane, the front of the hotel, whereas the reception is at the rear with the courtyard style drop off zone. There wasn't any assistance at this door, nor very clear directions to the main reception. The reception area is beautiful. Large floral displays and candles in storm lanterns with crystals are scattered around the area and a series of rich, gold and red colours complete the very Northern American with a touch of parisian feel of the lobby. The large wooden reception desk was manned by one lady who was busy number crunching when we arrived in front of her. After a few minutes of keyboard bashing, she looked up with a 'Yes?'. I started to state we had a reservation, interrupted by her request for 'sirname?'. After spelling my sirname she continued to type a huge amount of information and then added 'Credit Card'. It appears that sentences are not required when dealing with clients at this establisment. Once the card had been swiped, she pushed a card with two keys towards me and then finalised the transaction with 'lift behind you, floor 5 button'. I then added to her workload by confirming if the room was non-smoking - 'of course', with a waving hand guesture as my punishment. Again no assistance with baggage was offered, and there were no bell boys in sight. We made our way to the room. The Grosvenor is rather hard to navigate due to it's odd design, this isn't uncommon in London due to the age of buildings. It would all be simpler if you were escorted to the room, like most other hotels in this class. The public areas are again beautiful and very clean. The colours may look rather garish in photographs but do add a feeling of luxury and warmth to the hotel, something missing in many of the modern interiors hotels are opting for these days. All the corridors have new carpet and wall coverings. The signs in the public areas are false, they are laminated plastic rather than the brass they are designed to look like. When we found the room I was impressed with the size, smell and quality of fixtures. On first inspection the room looked clean. The bedding is of high quality, and very clean. A good selection of pillows are provided - including one GHH branded. At the end of the bed sits a large LCD screen with on-demand, local and internation stations and of course a clunky TV internet service. There is a special offer of \u00c2\u00a320 for unlimited movies, music and TV internet at the current time. This does not include the wired internet port. There wasn't a wireless signal in the room, but 3G works well on the 02 network. Within the TV cabinet is the mini bar and other honesty items, compelete with corkscrew and glasses. There isn't tea/coffee making facilities in the room, although these can be delivered to the room along with ice. A lamped desk area with leather chair is home to the hotel information, writing paper and local information. You will also find a comprehensive room service menu in this folder. The prices are in line with other 5* hotel in London and this is also true for the well stocked mini bar. All room service pricing excludes a \u00c2\u00a33.50 tray charge and 12.5% option service charge, again pretty normal for London. Two ornate chairs and a table with magazines create a nice feature between two large windows. Our room overlooked a side street but due to the secondary glazing noise wasn't an issue. Large wardobes with ample storage and full length mirrors create a feeling of space in the room. The bathroom was a good size, with large sink with mixer tap. There was a good selection, if not premium brand, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Two soaps were also provided, good quality and nice scent. The sink area appeared to be clean and well presented. The toilet, bidet and bath were divided from the sink area. The toilet was dirty, and the seat rather loose. The marble grouting in the bath/shower area was beginning to mould and covered in limescale. This was the first indication of cutting corners with housekeeping. The shower mat was also dirty and starting to mould. These are all due to lack of proper cleaning, it seems ashame as the refirbishment is a very high standard but keeping these standards is also important. When using the desk area I found a pack of open crackers and sweet packets under the chair. The room was clearly not hoovered in a statisfactory manner. It makes you wonder if the housekeeping team are required to clean rooms in a certain time, just doing the very minimum. After horror stories of cleaning glasses with dirty towels and sinks with toilet brushes in the media about London hotels, it does make you wonder what your eyes can't see that has been skipped during cleaning. The airconditioning was easy to use, and was quiet in operation during the night. There wasn't any noise from the corridor or adjoining rooms. We opted for in room breakfast and chose the continental option which was \u00c2\u00a321 per person. The full english was \u00c2\u00a327 and a healthy menu offered for \u00c2\u00a325.50. You have to add service and tray charges to this and you won't see much change from \u00c2\u00a350 for a breakfast for two. It was delivered on time, all items were fresh and all drinks were the correct temperature. The staff were excellent and even moved furniture around in the room so we could eat at the window. The member of the reception staff on check out was much more friendly and even helped us take our bags over to the concierge for storage during the day. He couldn't provide me with an email contact for the manager of the hotel but still an improvement over check in. After exploring London for the day using the nearby Marble Arch Underground Station (turn right out of the front of the hotel and head to the end of the road, just past the other Marriott). We returned back to the hotel and had drinks in Bord'eaux. The restaurant is beautiful and has a nice terrace looking over Park Lane to Hyde Park. We had two coffees and two cokes and the bill came to around \u00c2\u00a315. The location is lovely, and as it got cooler they put on large patio heaters and offered blankets for your shoulders. We were sat opposite Gary Rhodes who spoke very highly of the food. A very beautiful hotel, now restored to it's former glory. I think under it's current management they will be unable to continue to keep the standards in the accommodation and the very impersonal approach of the reception staff needs to be addressed in order for them to achieve the 'upper level' that is a J.

We booked this back in May and chose this hotel for it's reputation and because he is a Marriott Gold Elite Rewards member . At the time of reservation, we were not asked whether we wanted a smoking room or not but the miserable lookings receptionist at check in advised us that they only had smoking rooms left. As non-smokers we were both unhappy at this point but were actually pleasantly surprised that when we got into the room, it didnt smell of smoke and we decided to keep the room - our biggest mistake (apart from choosing this hotel!). The guests staying in the room adjacent to ours arrived back at around 11.30pm. Shortly after this, our room started filling with smoke and we realised that it was coming through the interconnecting door, which although shut, obviously didnt fit properly. We had to roll up blankets and towels to wedge into the gaps round the door frame, open the windows and have the air conditioning on full but still our room smelt absolutely disgusting. They started popping champagne and making a lot of noise and by 12pm, it was obvious that there were at least 4 and probably more like 6 of them in there. The noise got worse and worse and so we called down to reception to ask security to ask them to quieten down. Unfortunately, over an hour and a half and five phone calls later security had not checked on their room yet we got a knock on our door to ask us which room was making the noise - even though even at this moment they were having a full blown party and could be heard from the corridor! They did quieten down after security bothered to ask them to but were still going strong at 2.30am. With a room filled with smoke and very noisy neighbours, we did not sleep well and asked for a complaints form from another equally unfriendly receptionist on check out the next morning. Apparently Marriott do not have customer comment forms and since returning home, they also dont have any customer service contacts either as it took two days just to be given a phone number in Ireland that didnt exist. I called three times and waited over five hours for anyone at the hotel to call me back who then promised to investigate and call me within 2 days, which they didnt. This hotel could be lovely but it is relying on a reputation from yesteryear, which is does not deserve now. The location is great but our room was very small and very ordinary and for a rack rate of \u00c2\u00a3260 per night, did not even include any shower gel or tea/coffee making facilities. No-one opened doors, explained the hotels facilities, carried our bags, showed us to our room - we were not welcomed in any shape or form and not one member of staff smiled the entire time we were there. The service from reception and concierge was terrible - inexcusable for any hotel - and the lack of any customer service at the time of our stay or indeed since is quite shocking. If , like us, you thought Britain had gone smoke free - beware - the laws for hotels are quite different to pubs and restaurants. There is nothing anywhere on the Grosvenor House website thats indicates that there is the choice of smoking or non-smoking and we would have chosen another hotel if there had even been the slightest of hints that we may end up with a smoking room.

We were in there maybe 40 min's before they told us our room was ready and gave us the keys. We have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. We had a king size bed, non-smoking room. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was above average in size. The room itself was very roomy and decorated in tasteful colors and well kept furniture. We did use the lounge everyday for breakfast, and some evenings for cocktails and appetizers. This was very helpful so we didn't have to go and find something every morning for breakfast. We were here for vacation and really have no complaints. Everyone was very helpful when asked for something. When we called every evening for a wake-up call for the next morning they would ask if we would like coffee or tea delivered to us for the morning.

If we left for breakfast just to go upstairs to the lounge for 30 min's we locked valuables in the safe. Anytime we leave the room no matter what hotel we are staying at, valuables get locked up. There were no problems with outside noise. Oh, and the tube is about a 5 minute walk. If you go out the doors in the back and walk up to Mount ST. and take a left then walk about 3 blocks there are a couple of good restaurants.

The next morning when we were leaving, we could not find a doorman and this was at 9 AM!!!! Nor could we find someone at the concierge desk. We had to get someone from the front desk to go behind the concierge desk to look for the doorman. Apparently he was too busy socializing with the concierge that morning.

Be sure to get a rate that includes breakfast and all taxes. The full breakfast is truly excellent but wildly expensive if you pay for it. My only complaint is that staff can be a bit aloof until you engage them. I did not appreciate arriving by cab and having no one greet me nor offer assistance with luggage.

Renovations are almost complete and things are running very smoothly. They were still doing some painting of the rooms on the fourth floor, but it wasn't very bothersome once in the room. When we first arrived after an overnight flight, I was feeling ill. We were also very early, about 9 am. They sent us straight up to the Executive Lounge and made me some tea. They even checked us in from the lounge so that we wouldn't have to go back down to the lobby front desk. We were settled into our room within 20 minutes of arriving. Very nice concierge. (Thank You again!) They upgraded us to a Jr. Suite the first weekend, as the room we had requested was still occupied and they wanted to get us settled quickly. We got a nice little welcome gift of petit fours and wine. Personally, we both liked the regular rooms better, but I think that a Jr Suite would be nice for someone with children, or those sharing a room with a friend. There is a nice lounge area with television and sofa, and a separate sleeping area. Not really crazy about the red toile wallpaper, but it might appeal to some.... Unfortunately, I didn't take photos of the Jr Suite. Painless check out process and we went on to Bristol Marriott Royal for the week. The following weekend, our requested room was available. As I said before, the end rooms have more windows and just seem really spacious. The bed! Oh that bed is heavenly. Really nice amenities and they are restocked when your room is cleaned during the day, and again while you are gone for dinner. The Executive Lounge is a nice place to have pre-dinner cocktails or champagne, on the house. The food in the lounge tends to be more on the snack side, with a light breakfast or sandwiches available. The later evening desserts are great and shouldn't be passed by. Nice to stop after dinner and have coffee with Baileys and chocolate treats! We have always felt very safe walking around the area, even as late as midnight. A good sleep, and the rooms are very quiet. We never heard the first sound. While checking out early on Sunday morning, a very nice lady greeted us by name and handed us a bag of croissants and go cups of coffee to take with us. A very nice and thoughtful touch.

Very good finishes, exceptionally good aircon (but noisy), windows that opened, lovely restored antique furniture and huge Marriott bed. Very nice marble bathroom, but no seperate shower.

The GH will appeal to tourists with lots of money and business people attending functions in the biggest ballroom in Europe. I would stay here again, but as I got this as a Marriott points freebie, I have to say, I probably wouldn't choose this at this price, when there is a 4Seasons and a Mandarin Oriental for roughly the same cost within walking distance.

I am amazed at the bashing of this hotel that some have given it and have to wonder, were these people staying at the same hotel we stayed in? If so, we certainly had different experiences! It is in the upscale residential area of Mayfair, but it's not like you get the feel of it being all that much of a residential area (except that it's lot quieter than, say, Oxford St. nearby.) Hyde Park is across the st. It was very handy to shopping and dining, as well as restaurants. Both the Piccadilly and Bond Tube Lines were within an easy 10 min. or so walk. Oxford St., the main shopping st. in London, is about a 5 min. walk. Upon entering the hotel there was a lovely fragrance of calla lillies that were in tall vases in the lobby. The hotel is beautifully decorated and slightly more contemporary styled in the main public rooms than you might expect. There is a nice little deli/breakfast area that is good for quicker breakfasts or a snack, plus their main restaurant. The lounge is large and attractive. Elevators worked quickly. The banquet rooms were well designed and the food served at the 2 functions we attended in them were very good, as was their buffet breakfast on our last morning. We arrived around 1:30 p.m. on a Thur. in mid-Oct., but our room was not yet ready. They had us down for a king bed, but we had wanted two beds. My husband checked the room they planned to give us and it was quite small. They told us the only room w/2 beds they would have available was a smoking room. Someone we knew said they had been given a smoking room but it had NO odor of smoke whatsoever. So we accepted the much larger smoking room w/2 beds.The front desk was very nice about our dissatisfactions, and said our room would be ready in about an hr. and they would take our luggage up while we were away. We joined our daughter and her inlaws, and left the hotel for 2 hrs. or so. Upon our return, our room was ready. It was tastefully and elegantly furnished, and very comfortable. There was no smell of smoke at all. But our luggage had not been brought up. I called and it was immediately delivered. (The bellhop didn't seem to be the brightest star in the sky for sure! But that was minor.) This delay in luggage delivery and the time it took to get our room were the ONLY complaints we had about the entire 4 night stay. However, there was no stopper in our tub, and I love to take long, hot soaks after walking all around. The next morning I mentioned this to a staff member in the elevator who appeared to be a housekeeping supervisor. She asked me our room # and said she would take care of it immediately. After breakfast, not only had she taken care of that, but someone had replaced a burned out lightbulb in our foyer ceiling fixture, which had made it difficult to see when using the closet next to the front door prior to this. I was impressed that this was noticed w/out our mentioning it and taken care of so quickly! No matter what we needed, the staff was more than courteous and happy to help. They were not at all stuffy and were very friendly. The concierge desk was helpful on a couple of occassions and those there were usually able to give us good advice re: the particulars of various sights and destinations. If the person at the desk didn't know something, he managed to find out. It was cool to have doormen in top hats as well! (Just for photo ops to impress the folks back home!) I have to mention that on our last morning, I was late coming down to breakfast. My husband had joined others in a large dining room that was where a breakfast buffet was being held for the departing team and their guests. I had trouble locating everyone else, and was very late. Although I arrived just before it was being broken down, the staff urged me to take my time and enjoy my breakfast. One of them came over to us and carried on a very friendly and informative conversation, and there was NO HINT of my being rushed. Quite the opposite! I was told to relax and enjoy my meal, and they really seemed to mean it! I've not been inside of other hotels in London in this price range, which admittedly is above what we would normally be able to afford.

The hotel is beautiful and very elegant. In fact, more than once I felt as if I should apologize for the way we were dressed, since most of the people we saw in the lobby and common areas were much more dressed up than us! Our room (#568) was small (typical of European hotels) but very nicely furnished. Our view was awful, but that didn't bother us, since we were out sightseeing most of the day anyway. The bed didn't seem to be the standard Marriott Reviva bed, and was a little too firm, but did have a separate pillow top covering. There was a large closet and chest of drawers for clothes, and a nice TV (I think it was a 42\" screen). The marble bathroom was actually larger than I expected, with lots of counter space and nice thick towels. The only real complaint we had was with the shower. While there was a standard overhead showerhead in the tub, this was nonfunctioning. Instead, it had been replaced with a hand held contraption that was very difficult to use, as there was no way to attach it to the wall or anything. To make matters worse, because of the way the flexible metal hose was made, it tended to crimp and when that happened, startling changes of water temperature would occur. After a couple of days, I settled on a method that worked for me, and I share this for the sake of all the women out there - I would wash my hair under the bath faucet, then put the plug in the drain, shave my legs, take the plug out, and then, and only then, turn on the shower head and rinse off and get the conditioner out of my hair. This seemed to work okay, but I have to say, I was really happy to get back to my own shower! There are several restaurants and lounges in the hotel. We did a small breakfast at the little cafe most mornings, they have pastries, coffee (nasty) and tea (wonderful). The same place, Bord'eaux, has a sit-down restaurant as well, where we did breakfast one day and a light meal one afternoon, it's pricey (as is everything in London) but nice enough. We also did the afternoon tea at the Park Room one day, and that was wonderful. There are a couple of lounges, and we did drinks at the Library one night, very nice atmosphere. The hotel is located right on Park Lane in between Hyde Park Corner and Marble Arch undergroud stations. The neighborhood is very nice, very upper class and quiet.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA Place to Be Pampered\u201d", "Author": "BornTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR20855192", "Content": "Every positive thing that has been said about this hotel is true.

I did not mind the charge, however, manuvering through the internet with the television keyboard was difficult and clumsy.

I booked it for my fiancee's birthday and made the hotel aware of this when contacting them to request a king bed. I had also requested a room with some sort of view which they said they could offer if available at check in. For the price it all seemed good and my fiancee was very excited. One tip if you arrive by tube...go to marble arch and not hyde park corner. On check in we were only greeted at the desk. We entered from Park Lane which is not the main entrance. The main entrance is on a side road where you are greeted by porters dressed in top and tail. Reception were friendly and gave us our keys to the room after completing the paperwork. There was no offer for anyone to take our bags nor show us to the room. Entering the room it was small, but that was expected, and there was no view at all. The bed was pulled out and to on one side of the room and where the bed should have been there was plaster wrappers and other rubbish on the floor. My fiancee contacted the reception and 5 minutes later the male who ahd checked us in arrived at the room. He gave us keys to another room which was an \"upgrade\" and told us how to find it. Still there was no offer to take our bags nor were we shown to the room. Entering the second room it was slightly larger and this time it had a view of hyde park. We were happy with the move but still slightly disappointed with the level of service. Thirty minutes later we were getting ready to go out for dinner. I was in my boxer shorts and my fiancee was just taking off her trousers and in walks a maintenance man to change one of the outside light bulbs. No knock at the door, he just let himself in and then introduced himself to my shocked fiancee explaining that the housekeeping had sent him. Not wanting to ruin our night away we decided not to complain and continued to get ready for dinner. Looking forward to a nice shower i go to the bathroom and go take the bath mat from the corner of the bath where it was rolled up to find that it was covering a large number of pubic hairs which lined the top of the bath. This was now becoming a disaster but i still did not wish to spoil my fiancees's birthday further by constantly complaining so i washed them away myself. We then considered whether to order breakfast in bed and contacted reception to confirm the prices which are extremely unclear on the order form. It turned out that an english breakfast was \u00c2\u00a353 for two people and continental breakfast \u00c2\u00a342. The rest of the night went without any problems and we were having a lovely sleep in the large comfy bed until 8am when yet again we had an unwanted guest. This time in the form of a maid who again did not knock and simply let herself in and when challenged she simply replied \"maid service\". She was quickly ordered to leave and we decided to put the \"do not disturb\" form outside and attempted to get back to sleep. Only 30 minutes later we were again woken, at least this time they had the decency to knock but obviously decided that it doesn't matter if you have a do not disturb sign on display. Needless to say we could not wait to leave and duly filled in their customer comment card. The only positive i can give is the comfort of the bed. Other than that there is nothing to make this hotel special. There was sick on the corridor carpet, both rooms were dirty, the staff rude and inconsiderate.

We certainly made the right decision! It's difficult enough to find a nice, affordable hotel in London and we thought that finding a nice one within our budget would be difficult. I sat at the computer one night on the name-your-price website and my British husband laughed at me as I entered $250/night for a 5-star hotel in the Bloomsbury/Soho area. I never expected my offer to be accepted, especially for 3 rooms, but we were lucky enough to get the Grosvenor House!! The rooms were all 3 exquisite with the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The front desk staff was very helpful and the location was superb. We did have a bit of a stressful check in as the taxi dropped us at the wrong entrance, so there was no one to help us with our luggage (6 people, each with a suitecase and carry-on bag). We had to wait outside with the luggage until a bellman was able to bring the trolleys around for us which took about 10 minutes, so make a note, don't get dropped off at the Park Lane entrance! The only other issue was with the restaurant/lounge in the hotel. After the theater we wanted a simple snack and some hot chocolate. We were 6 of the maybe 10 people there, so it certainly was not too busy. We order 6 hot chocolates at a cost of 5 pounds each, a cheese tray and a dessert tray, each 12 pounds. It took nearly a half hour to get the hot chocolate, which was powder mixed with hot water, nothing like the hot chocolate we had been accustomed to throughout Europe. It was about 20 more minutes before the cheese and dessert arrived, we never saw our server again. The cheese was supposed to be served with fruit, nuts, honey and bread. There was only cheese with bread we literally could not break. The dessert tray was to have several types of small desserts, there only a large slice of chocolate torte. We could not find anyone in the restaurant to complain to, so we went to the front desk and it was all taken care of for us, but still disappointing as we went to bed hungry!

My actual wedding ceremony went without a htich everything I asked for was done to a very high standard, the room was laid out and decorated perfectly. After the ceremony there were endless staff going around making sure guests glasses weren't empty. The reception was also amazing. The food, wine, table displays, menus, flowers were all perfect. I honestly couldn't believe how well it all came together, I expected a couple of gitches but not one thing went wrong. During the meal, the staff were very attentive but not intrusive. The floor manager announced everything on time and he was so helpful. I visited the hotel at least once a month for 8 months prior to my wedding. I was concerned that as a 5 star hotel it might seem intimidating but I never had a bad experience, the staff were always very warm and welcoming and very attentive. Prior to the wedding I had many meetings with the wedding co-ordinator who was so friendly and efficient and always set my mind to rest, she always returned calls and emails and kept me up to date on even the smallest of details. The hotel recommended the band (who were fab) the inhouse florist did our flowers which were so beautiful everyone wanted to take them away when the wedding was over. After a very long but perfect day we got back to our room to find it decorated with rose petals on the bed, floor and in the bath and they left us a bottle of champagne on ice with chocolate covered strawberries and a wonderful card! We had the most perfect wedding day and we wouldn't change a thing. Since our honeymoon we've had lots of cards and emails from guests saying it was the best wedding they've been too, best food, band and venue!!

I had a positive experience, with a couple of minor hiccups. All in all, I would recommend the Grosvenor House as a comfortable, convenient place to stay in London. First, the hotel is in a fantastic location. It's located just down the street from the Marble Arch tube stop and right across the street from Hyde Park. The Mayfair neighborhood is one of London's nicest (and most expensive) and offers a lot in terms of restaurants and nightlife. Oxford Street and all of its great shopping is a short walk (2-3 minutes) from the hotel also. As most of the other reviews have noted, the hotel is undergoing a top-to-bottom renovation that is scheduled to last two years (although one bellman I asked about it said he thought it would take an extra year). As some areas of the hotel are still unrenovated, I can see why some of the previous reviews are negative. The hotel's former condition was pretty sad. In fact, I think most of the photos that Expedia has on its site are pre-renovation. The lobby is now really gorgeous and many of the other public areas have been renovated as well. The hotel has a very hip bar called RedBar which, as you may have gathered by the name, is done completely in red. It's very cool. There seems to be construction currently taking place on all floors of the hotel, but I did not hear much noise during the day. Maybe I was just lucky, but I did not find the noise to be an issue. I believe that the only rooms being provided to guests at this time have been renovated. My first room was nicely decorated, although a little small. It was a little difficult to maneuver around the bed to get to the window. The bathroom was really huge and had a great overhead \"rain\" shower. Unfortunately, during my stay the toilet broke and couldn't be fixed so the hotel moved me to a very nice room on the top floor. This room was larger than my first room (plus had a working toilet) and had a limited view of the city, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. This room was also very nicely decorated and had Marriott's new bedding (as all renovated rooms do, I believe), which is really great. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Everyone says hello and they go out of their way to assist with any request. There is a breakfast buffet served in one of the dining rooms (which has not yet been renovated) each morning. You can choose between the hot or cold buffet and the food was quite good. The price, as with everything in London, is high and better deals can most certainly be found if you wander out into the neighborhood a bit. In summary, I would definitely recommend the Grosvenor House. Once the renovations are complete, I think this hotel will be fabulous. In the meantime, I think enough has been renovated to make for a very comfortable stay.

We were aware of the renovations taking place in advance. With the exception of our dinner being only warm due to the location of the dining area so far away from the kitchens we were not greatly affected by the renovations - this could be as there were unlikely to be any contractors working on New Years Eve! Most of our disappointment was really down to poor service - something that is not excusable even with the refurb. The dining service was not to the standard expected for the prices charged - for two of our courses my wife's meal was brought to the table a good 2-3 minutes before mine. We had also requested a copy of the menu in advance which was not provided, yet we subsequently found that it was a set 6-course meal that included some things that we didn't like. When we asked if we could order from the ala carte menu this was declined, but we subsequently found that we could have ordered room service from a fairly good menu! In hindsight... Gordon Ramsey has two restaurants within a 5 minute walk! My credit card was also charged after check-out for something that was not ours. I had no notification of this - I only found out when I saw the charge on my statement. I took the time and trouble to write and complain and received a very honest and good response from the Hotel Manager. This has placated me somewhat in the belief that they may have taken my feedback to improve the service they offer. On the positive side, we stayed in an Executive Room, which was a very good size with large bathroom. Whilst it is obvious that the decor is dated it was in very good order and still presented the grandeur you would expect from a 5-star hotel. The upgrade to Executive Room cost us about \u00c2\u00a370 extra over the standard room and is well worth it and excellent value for money.

We already had sticker shock from the near 2/1 USD/GBP exchange rate, but at a little over $300/night I expected more. I had also heard that the Grosvenor was a true luxury hotel. I would say that we lucked out with good weather during our time - if it was raining and we were forced to stay in our room, my review would be more negative. I will caveat this all by saying that I booked a package with an on-line service, and therefore my expectations were - as with all my on-line bookings - that we would get the slummiest rooms in the hotel. In true form, we ended up with a 2nd floor room looking at scaffolding as they are redoing the exterior of the hotel. We faced inward - toward where the taxis pull-up ... which I think was overall more quiet than being on the Park Lane side if you're on a lower floor. However, don't plan on sleeping in during the week as the doormen will start whistling for taxis at around 7am for people there on business. We had a king non-smoking room which was an OK size. This may be a US thing (haven't been to Europe in a while) but the \"king\" was actually two twin mattresses put together so you had to be careful to not fall into the crack. The hotel overall had a worn feel - like it would have been something spectacular 10 years ago, but the interior hallways are showing their age. We also had an issue with the electricity as a fuse blew out in our room, knocking out some of the lighting. They were prompt in fixing it, though. The room was serviced like a higher-end hotel, with room service coming by around 6pm each day to check if we needed fresh towels, turn-down service, etc. For some reason they did not provide new toiletries each day, though. (My experience with upper-end hotels is that even if they see that you have half of a shampoo bottle left, they'll automatically leave another new one). I will say that the location is excellent - immediately across from Hyde park and close to Marble Arch and Bond Street tube stations for easy access to other parts of the city. You certainly are paying for the Mayfair area in the price. In short, a good location, but we probably could have had a similar hotel experience for 50 pounds less a night at the Marriott nearby on Park Lane.", "Date": "October 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Tx", "Title": "\u201cHotel has seen better days\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2518204", "Content": "Has seen better days. I stayed at the Grosvenor House for two weeks I found the hotel to be old and worn. When I first got to my floor where my room was located I noted that the halls had an unpleasant spice smell to it all of the time. I think the smell comes from the Lebanese restaurant that services the Hotel. The first thing I noticed about my room was the lack of amenities that you would find in a US hotel. The room lacked an iron to press your clothes. The Hotel did offer a service to press your clothes at a charge pretty close to the amount that you could go out and buy new clothes. The hotel also lacked an alarm clock, however there was a timer on the TV that you could set to turn on at a prescribed time. My first night I left a wakeup call for an important business meeting the next day. I never received the wakeup and was consequently late for my meeting. When I complained at the desk they assured me it would not happen again. The next morning I received four wakeup calls to insure I was awake. After that I just used the alarm on the TV. When I made my reservations I had requested a King Size bed but found that the bed was actually two twins pushed together an to make things worse the beds weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at the same height so there was a noticeable hump in the bed. I found that the Air Condition in the room to be woefully inadequate to cool the room. At the highest setting the room stayed at about the mid to upper 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Another problem was with the smoke detector, the steam from the shower set off the smoke detector no less then 5 times while I stayed at the hotel. One of the other things I found annoying was housekeeping coming by every night at around 8:00 at night to see if there was anything I needed. This is usually the time I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be disturbed. And it got to be annoying answering the door all of the time. By the second week of this I just put the do not disturb sign so they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the staff to be overly friendly usually at a hotels you get a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 have a nice day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or some kind of greeting. The only response I received from them would be if I initiated it.", "Date": "September 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newtown, Pa.", "Title": "\u201cwe had an overall positive experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2332710", "Content": "We returned last night from 5 nights at the Grosvenor House. After reading the reviews on this site, we had some reservations about staying here, but the location and the price convinced us to stay at this property. Needless to say, we had zero expectations. The staff won us over within our first 20 minutes. We pulled up in a rental car, after driving around southern England for 3 days .(if you've ever driven there, you know what a harrowing experience that is!) We were happy to have driven into London and gotten to the hotel. Tony, one of the wonderful concierge staff, met us at the car and totally took care of getting the car returned to the rental company, as well as the congestion fee. That was the perfect welcome. We chcked in, requesting a renovated room (as suggested by a reader here). The registration clerk said she had a renovated room, but not one with a king bed, as requested. She claimed it had a queen. We took it; it was revovated beautifully, but TINY. The bed looked more like a double to me. We expected a smallish room; it was London, not the US. We tried to adjust the A/C, but the dial just kept spinning. We called for service, and a service man was there in less than 5 minutes. While he was checking the A/C, we called down to the desk to ask if we could see a roomn with a king bed, even though it wasn't renovated. The bellman was there again in leass than 5 minutes. The second room was much more spacious than the first, and attractively furnished. Yes, the upholstery on one of the chairs was worn in one spot; so what?The marble bathroom was elegantly appointed. The shower was great. The toiletries were first- rate. More towels? No problem; we called housekeeping and they were there in 5 minutes. Was the hotel perfect? Of course I could name some areas where they could improve. I can't believe people write in complaining about the cost of room service. Who expects room service or hotel restaurants to be reasonably priced? We asked the concierge to recommend some places for breakfast and dinner. They gave us lots of choices within walking distance, and we had fabulous, reasonably priced meals. The location of this hotel is terrific, convenient to busses, the tube, and restaurants. Yes, you must ask for what you want. If you don't like your room, ask to see another one.

We were put in the apartment/suite wing of the hotel. The room faced an internal courtyard and our view for the next 5 days was into people's offices. We had no natural lighting. The sofas were old and stained and bedroom was small and smelly. The furniture was similar to those bought at a flea market. If the hotel says it has a/c, one expects it to work. We had one of those cheap portable units in our room. It made a lot of noise but it just didn't work. Continental breakfast was included in the room rate which consisted of one bread roll, a bowl of cereal and tea/coffee. Everything else was extra.
