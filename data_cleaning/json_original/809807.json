There was no lift, but fortunately we were on the first floor so we didn't have to walk up too many flights of stairs. Yes, at first sight the rooms looked dark and gloomy and others cheap and old but that was not the first of our problems. The baths were dirty, the towels were probably used by Cleopatra and there was not one tissue in the whole hotel. Only shampoo was provided- no body wash or bath gel. There was only a cheap, sticky soap cake. The beds were extremely low and there was hair all through the sheets. Plus, the beds were all infested with bed bugs - we have bites to prove it. The pillows were only large chunks of foam in a pillow case - the cheapest kind of pillow you can get. The ceilings were covered in yellow and brown stains. The TV was in Italian but not all programs had an option to change the language. The skirting boards were falling off and we could nearly pull them off the wall. The views from our rooms were of brick walls and old windows. Not only did we not have air conditioning but we had no heating as apparently it would only be turned on for the whole hotel in 3 weeks. We were absolutely freezing. So for our two rooms, we asked for a heater each but there was only one available for the whole hotel. Then, when we asked, we were not allowed an iron as it was apparently European law that no hotel guest could iron in the hotel, without supervision as a building had burnt down from an ironing accident previously. Instead, we had to pay for our ironing to be done by the hotel (it was very expensive) which was not even done properly. At the Stucky Hilton however, we were allowed to iron ourselves in the rooms and the rate was below half price of Ca' Alvise. After being thoroughly disappointed with the hotel, we went down to Reception to complain. We asked if we could get a refund if we moved hotels but the lady said no and did an evil chuckle. This hotel was a terrible price for the quality we received and does DEFINITELY NOT deserve it's 4 star rating. It should be a 2 star hotel and we are being generous with that rating. It was a nightmare trying to get around as we were quite far away from everything and the hotel was extremely hard to find as it was tucked away in a little corner.

Well situated. 5min walk to St. Marcus sq. or to Rialto. Not far from the bridge to the Accademia in order to cross to the opposite Sestiere. Next block to the \"La Fenice\". Close to many options for lunch, dinner and coffee. The room was spacious, but... The furniture was vintage-like with post-modern Kitsch feeling. The same was the black&white dinning room, featuring a gold colored safe! The bathroom was modern, with a mixture of classical elements. I didn't find any amenities other than shampoo and shower gel. No bathrobe, no shoe polisher (look for the electric brash at the seating room), no slippers, no shower cap, no cotton pads... Even the plastic bag for the laundry was missing... Just the laundry price-list was in place. I appreciated the large safe at the room that accommodated my laptop, ipad and valuables. I didn't like the fact that the door was not properly locking and wasn't fixed even after I reported it. It was a nightmare to master the TV, with two remotes and Sky satellite service. Expect WiFi Internet upon a fee. The room was on the way to the reception and all the hotel guests paraded in front of my door, making noise early in the morning, to go for breakfast or check out. Not mentioning that the reception phone was heard as if it was in my room. The breakfast was of limited variety and low quality. The juice was no other than colored water and the American coffee was horrible. Ask to have an espresso prepared for you. The personnel was quite friendly and polite, even though some of them could try to be more helpful. Don't forget add the new Venice-city tax while calculating your accommodation expenses. (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac4 per person, per day, I think). Expect \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70 water taxi from/to train station and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac105 water taxi from/to airport.

When we found this hotel on booking.com, it offered a Junior Suite which offered, and I quote from the website, a \"Large suite on one the higher floors with rooftop views, free newspapers and sparkling wine\". The views this room offered, and I quote again, were \"View (sea, garden, landmark, etc.)\". When we were shown to our room, it was on the 1st floor with a view of a wall. If we stuck our head out the window, we could see a long narrow street, and only the wall of the building next door. When I asked the reception about this, he said that for the good view you had to book directly on their website. When I showed him our booking confirmation saying the view we were offered and had paid for, he said, our \"higher\" floor was higher than the ground, and the views from our room were panoramic of the street. Our booking was non refundable, which I think is absolutely disgusting, as we were promised a whole lot from this hotel, but when we got there, no promise was kept. For booking a Junior Suit in a supposed 4 star hotel, we were expecting greatness, and the most luxurious hotel on our four week tour of Europe. This was the worst experience of our trip and the most expensive. Although we got this room at a discount for last minute booking, it was said to be marked down from 1020 euro. With a price and promise like that, you can only expect the best. I think it is shocking that a hotel will lure you in with promises of everything you want to experience in Venice, make it non refundable, and then not follow through with what you have paid for. To show you our view, see the attached photo of what we saw from our window! Will not recommend this hotel and will never go there again! Also, the staff at breakfast were extremely rude and made you feel like you were getting in their way, and the cups they set on the table, if you took one to use, they huffed, went to the kitchen to get another and slammed it back on the table behind you.

My advice, especially when arriving with luggage, would be to use the Vaparetto stop at San Angelo and ignore the directions shown on the hotels web site. The hotel will tell you to use San Marco but this involves crossing 3 bridges and is a less simple route where you can get easily lost. You can take the Ailaguna (Orange line) direct from the airport to San Angelo and the hotel is a very straightforward 5 minute walk away over just 1 bridge. Secondly this hotel is ok. You get what you pay for and it is no different here. Our room could have done with a lick of paint but overall it was fine. Sadly even though it was very hot, the hotel were apparently not allowed to switch on the air conditioning so our room was fairly hot. Opening the windows unfortunately led to midges/mozzies coming in our room (this is probably a problem with Venice in general - slow moving water and insects sounds like great place for biting things to live and breed !!!!) and taking chunks out of us !!! Oh and don't think that you'll be able to iron any crumpled clothes - irons are a fire risk and the hotel will not lend you one (the place is built on water for goodness sake !!!)

We where dubious about the location, as all the reviews seem to indicate that the hotel is hard to find, it isnt honestly. Although we did get lost once, but then thats Venice, you just need a good map. The hotel could be reached from a number of Vaperetto stops, Raialto, St Marcs Valaresso, St Angelo and Academia. None of which where more than a 5 to 10 minute walk away.

The bed was comfy and the room warm enough considering we stayed in January.We even had a dressing room between our bedroom and bathroom which consisited of a wardrobe, dressing table and sofa.

They had coffee, tea, 2 choices of juice, bread rolls, 3 types of croissant, jams and chocalate spread, ham, salami, cheese, bolied eggs, 4 cereals, fresh friut and yoghurts.A good choice for a continental breakfast we thought.

It didn't spoil the trip though because the hotel was clean, comfy and the staff were friendly and efficient. Who comes to Venice to spend time in the hotel looking at the decor anyway?!! Check in/out were both hassle free. The staff that we spoke to all spoke English which is a good job since my Italian is embarrassingly poor! The breakfast was a reasonable continental breakfast consisting of croissants, toast, yoghurt,ham, cheese, cereal, coffee, juice, fruit etc which was fine for the 4 days we stayed there. I think I might have been sick of it after a week though! The location is perfect - 5 mins walk from St Marks Square and the same to Rialto Bridge. Couldn't ask for better. It's not the easiest to find though, especially if you're carrying suitcases! The room was clean and comfortable. There was a kettle, but it only came with a seclection of fruit tea. Some coffee would have been nice during the long wait for my other half getting ready! The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath which was a nice touch after a long day on the move. The room also had a mini bar which was expensive but not a problem as minibars are always expensive. I've read a few complaints about no English channels on the tv - I found 2! (well, 1 1/2!) CNN news and MTV (mix of English and Italian). Who wants to watch tv when in Venice anyway?! On Venice itself...a wonderful place for a short break. Very expensive, but if you expect it and avoid the main tourist areas for food it's slightly cheaper. November is a great time of year to go - I can imagine it's a nightmare in the Summer as it'll be hot and extremely overcrowded. The vaparetto (water buses) are excellent, as are the trains out of Venice - much better than the UK! A gondola ride is an extortionate essential for a first visit to Venice!

The bathroom was actually quite large welcoming. The outlet in the bathroom had a US (110v) and Italian (220V) outlet so that was nice. To promote Murano, the hotel offered a complimentary water taxi to the island which takes you directly to one of the glass production facilities. There was no obligation to buy anything and there was a full demonstration. To get back, you either took the vaporetto or paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 for another taxi back. There was a comfortable lobby down stairs so you could just sit (as the bed was the only place to sit in the room). The breakfast buffet was simple but delicious and bountiful. Staff was cordial.
