We were not at all dissapointed. Our trip got off to a bad start as we had decided to get our visas upon arrival at Istanbul airport - unfortunatelt the airport staff speak very little English and it took us a couple of hours to get this sorted. However all unpleasantness was forgotten the second we stepped out of the airport. The airport transfer car we had booked was waiting for us and 20 mins later we were at our hotel (abt 20 euros, 40 lira). The hotel staff were fantastic and nothing like that warm Doubletree cookie on arrival. We had a standard room which was quite large and looked out to the street opposite the hotel. The Grand Bazaar is just a 5-7 min walk away and the attractions such as the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia are just a 10 lira taxi ride away - we stayed away from the trams due to the numerous pickpocketing stories I heard and also because they always seemed quite crowded. Breakfast was 50 lira per person which was expensive but the variety of food made it completely worth it. We did not pay for Wifi in our room as there is a business centre on the 1st floor open to all guests where you can also print for free. All in all our stay was made all the more special by the wonderful staff at the hotel who were always happy to help us plan our day or book tours. A special mention for Kadir who took very good care of us and made sure we never got swindled by taxis and always knew how to get back to the hotel.

A warm cookie was given to us at check in which was AWESOME tasting, and there was a plate of fruit awaiting us in the room. The room was a bit small, but very comfortable...great shower and very comfortable bed. Coffee and tea making facilities in the room. The business lounge was on the first floor and was always open...no kids on facebook, playing games, etc. Computers were accessible at all times. We are gold Hhonors members so breakfast was included (I'd highly recommend starting your day with their awesome breakfast buffet. It provided a wide array of tasty dishes). Cook to order eggs and omelets were provided by the friendly chef. The servers were very friendly. Service at times was hit or miss...sometimes you'd get the whole pot of coffee, sometimes not, sometimes your juice was refilled, sometimes not. But overall, it would be well worth paying for the breakfast with your room rate. Getting to the hotel was a snap. We took the Metro from the airport to Zetinburnu stop (2 TL each), transferred to the T-1 Tram (right there at the metro exit...another 2 TL ((buy tokens good for both metro and trams at the airport)) and got out at Laleli Universite. It's right outside the hotel...Note Google maps shows the hotel closer to Beyazit. It's NOT! The Laleli is right outside the hotel. When we left the hotel to get to the airport at 9:00 A.M. the tram had plenty of room (I'd scouted it out previous days and it consistently had lots of room). We made it from the hotel lobby to our gate (checking in for our flight, going through security and screening) in one hour and ten minutes. It was extremely convenient. The hotel is located in the Old town just across the street from the Grand Bazaar. It provided a nice oasis from the hustle and bustle. It was a short walk to other sights...blue mosque, sophia agia, etc. Istanbul is a great walking city. We actually walked to and from Taksim square from our hotel, and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. Internet service is provided if you're a gold HHonors member. We'd get coupons for each day for each device (IPad Iphone, computer, etc.). These were good for 24 hours. It was very easy to access. Printers in the business lounge allow you to print your boarding passes. Overall, this hotel really was a find. We travel all over the world, and we really enjoyed Istanbul.

Boutique and design are the two of the most abused words in the hospitality sector these days.

We walked to Sultanahmet the first 2 days (it is like a 10-15 minute walk), but the tram is really cheap - 2 liras per person each way. So you can take the tram right up to the last stop and only pay 2 liras. You need to go to the machines, insert your money (it gives you change) and then get your tokens- or jetuns as they are called. You can also buy a card for 10 lira and top it off, if you find that easier, but buying jetuns falls cheaper for a tourist! We took a private transfer from Ataturk to the hotel for 21 euros. Hilton quoted 90 euros for a limo transfer, and really that is just not needed. We finally fought traffic, and were dropped off at the entrance to our hotel, which rose up out of nowhere... It is situated in a small high end mall. On checking in, we were welcomed with warm choco chip cookies (and I was sold)!!I asked for a corner room as I had read reviews that the rooms were really small.. but unfortunately they said that they were all taken... Our room was very small,( by our standards), but was clean, smelt new.. Amazing fittings and lush carpeting! the bathroom just had a (rainforest) shower- no tub, but was fine with us, and Neutrogena bath products for our use... The king sized bed was nice, but too soft for our liking, so we tossed and turned all night... and woke up with aches... I was not exactly pleased with the hotel, given the size of the room, but it soon grew onto me, and I'd definitely give it 4 stars...

As I travel quiet often throughout the year I have stayed at many hotels around the world including Istanbul, and I can honestly say that the Doubletree By Hilton is in my top 3 best hotels in Istanbul due to the amazing service and quality of the hotel. The location is perfect for tourists who require being close to all the tourist attractions in Sultan Ahmnet, Galata Koprusu, Topkapi, Kapali Carsi (Grand Bazaar) etc.. Travelling from the hotel to other locations is very good also, as mentioned in previous reviews there is a Tram stop located outside. I ate a few times at the hotel and can say that the food was very good, I do not understand why a few people in other reviews and failed to notice this. The Turkish Hamam, Jaccuzi and steam room are brilliant after a long day of walking around various attractions, towels, robes, slippers and even shorts are provided free of charge by the hotel. My room was on the third floor across the business centre where there is 24 hours free internet access and it was cleaned everyday and very modern. I cannot praise the bathroom enough, as it provided you with everything you required even the water from the shower was hot at the blink of an eye. The only draw back to the rooms was the size, its a bit tight around the bed area, but this is not a problem at all as the room looks brilliant. The only dissapointment was the WiFi internet service provided by the hotel. Although I was expected to charged for internet use, I was felt let down by the reception staff when they told us that we had to purchase two different WiFi connections for two different devices, meaning if you purchase one password you could only use it on one device at a time - this has to change as you are charged 20TL per 24 hour connection. Overall despite the small drawbacks, I would definitely go back to stay at this hotel again in the close future and would rate it a 5 Star hotel, however the WiFi problem needs rethinking.

That said, you must under no circumstances leave Istanbul without a visit to Z\u00c3\u00bcbeyir Ocakbasi (close to Taksim Square in Beyoglu): simply the best kebabs I've ever tasted...

A friend of ours was not made aware of this at his hotel and got ill on the trip. The beds were very comfy and nice quality linens. The noise was a problem for us. Our rooms overlooked the very big main drag and the constant sirens and just overall traffic noise were pretty bad. If you can, I would recommend getting a room that does not overlook the main drag.

The gym was very good and the hotel offers a free hot tub, sauna and steam room (very nice!) and I also had a massage which was hands down the best I ever had.

As I reported such unprofessional behavior to the front desk, they offered small apology and I had no follow-up on the incident. Other less disturbing service faults confirmed my feeling that the service staff is not up to a 5 star hotel. Just few examples: at breakfast it was necessary to get the attention of the waiter for having the refill of coffee and orange juice; and one morning, the breakfast room supervisor made resistance for looking for a better table than the one (close to the entrance) that she wanted us to take. Another problem quite bothersome was that I was assigned a room facing a side street on which there were noisy truck / crane works till 1 am on both nights I was there (and in my booking and at check-in I had asked specifically for a quiet room). The sound insulation of the windows, though double pane, is ineffective as the noise seems passing through the windows frame. I imagine that this can be a significant issue for the rooms facing the main road on the front of the hotel. Overall I would rate the Doubletree by Hilton Old Town Istanbul more as a 4 star hotel (and 3.5 star for the service) rather than the 5 star advertised.

I sometimes used the \"tram\" which is a large modern airconditioned street car which costs about one dollar. Taxis are available, all equipped with meters, although I only used a few times.

My experience on this trip was so bad that I moved out to the nearest reputable and yet reasonably priced hotel in the area. And I am so glad that I took the hassle of moving! I arrived at the hotel at 9 AM and the incredibly friendly front desk employee gave me a room, and per my request found a room which was really quiet. I read reviews which said that the rooms facing he main street can be noisy during the day, so take this into account when checking-in. I stay at the Hilton chain often, but this was the first time I chose the Double Tree by Hilton. I have to say that I loved every minute of my stay! The rooms are spacious, with very, very comfortable beds and lovely linens, nice lights, good TV, big bathrooms (with Nutrogena toiletries), beautiful slippers. The only thing is that my bathroom in the shower area had some sort of a smell, maybe from the drain. The Front desk staff was always very polite and helpful and helped me to confirm my flights. Forgot to mention the warm chocolate chip cookie I received on arrivial- obviously a Double Tree tradition! The complimentary fruit plate in my room was also a nice surprise. I read that the hotel has a few very nice restaurants but since I was traveling alone this time, I did not go. In all the reviews I have posted on the Trip Advisor I always try to be fair and to give all the details- good and bad, so despite my great satisfaction with this hotel, I need to mention the following three disadvantages the Double Tree has: 1. Location- the hotel is not in the Sultanahmet area where all the historic sights are and which is so pleasant to walk around at any time of the day. The hotel is about 20 minutes very slow walk downhill from Sultanahmet (I guess you can take this distance in 10 minutes if you walk faster). But on your way back it is all uphill walking so if you are tired you'd better take the tram. The good news is that there is a tram stop (the University stop) right in front of the hotel (1 token is 1.75 TL)- it is one stop to the Grand bazaar and three stops to Sultanahmet.The area around the hotel is nice and safe at night. 2. Internet charge- although not as expensive as the Hilton chain, you will have to pay for internet here- 15 TL for 24 hours. There is wired and WiFi, and is pretty fast. While all the hotels in the Sultanahmet area ofeer free internet, it is slow and sometimes- non existent. 3. Breakfast will cost you extra- I believe it is about 25 TL per person. I did not try it so can not comment on it. All the hotels in the Sultanahmet area offer free, even though sometimes with questionable quality, breakfast. Despite this, I believe that the Double Tree hotel is a great alternative to the small, noisy, cramped and often- privitive so-called boutique hotels in the Sultanahmet area.

We were lucky to find this one and I would strongly recommend it.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "LisainHove", "ReviewID": "UR112821545", "Content": "One of the nicest Hilton's I've stayed in.

The hotel is brand new, very stylish and modern. If you read something about cold water and other issues- this was true when the hotel just opened., now fixed. Location: Tell the taxi driver to driver you to Laleli, nobody knows this hotel as it is brand new. When you pass the Crowne Plaza it is just 500m more up the street. Check-in and check out: Easy going. Breakfast: Just great! Better than in other fancy hotels I have stayed in Istanbul like the Grand Hyatt. Rooms: Modern and stylish room, nice bathroom with great shower. Some might rate rooms as a bit small, for me still OK as nobody stays here 24h. Hotel is busy over weekends but during the week especially nice for business customers as not many people stay there. Staff is excellent, very well trained.

I was nicely surprised by the modern design and the fact that this hotel is new. I first was thinking about Barcelo hotel on the same street but when arrived I was so glad that I had chosen Doubletree - Barcelo is way too old and not modern. Doubletree has a very nice terrace with food and wine available. I need to say though that their double rooms are very small - no space at all... and you would need to pay for internet connection extra ( around 7 EUR). Breakfast is buffet style but not really excellent that would make you eat their every morning and besides it is way overpriced (around 20 EUR per person). Some of the rooms face the oposite building or the windows are inside of the hotel and you do not have the view at all... In sum, I'd still recommend staying in this hotel if you need to be close to Sultanahmed of Istanbul as it is one of the best avaialble in this area.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel by far with the best staff I have ever seen!!\u201d", "Author": "mswathi", "ReviewID": "UR106688008", "Content": "I happen to visit istanbul with my mom and my friend last week and we stayed at the doubletree the entire time. Everything about the hotel was awesome. The staff by far were exceptional. Everyone from the door man to the receptionist to the spa people were soo friendly and soo nice. They are soo attentive and help you with anything at any time of the day. My favorite was Kemal. He was a gem. He used to suggest restaurants to eat at and would call them and make reservations for us. Some of those places even have their own shuttles that pick you up from the hotel to take you to eat at the restaurant and would bring you back when you're done. Another thing is that it is so close to the train station. You walk outside and there it is. This made travelling to different places so much easier. In addition, you're only a 10 minute walk from sultanamet, grand bazar, and hagia sophia as well if you don't want to take the train... The hotel has a good breakfast and their spa was awesome. It has a steam room, sauna, jacuzii and a turkish bath, which were all free to the hotel guests plus a 24 hour gym. The only thing i didn't like about our room was that the bathroom has a slight odor of drainage but besides that I couldn't find a thing wrong with the place. I loved turkey and being in this hotel probably helped it even more.. I would definately stay at this same hotel if I go back to Istanbul..", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, excellent, excellent\u201d", "Author": "paulmac44", "ReviewID": "UR106552513", "Content": "This hotel is really on the money - location is near enough to the Old Town without being in the middle of it, it is right at the tram stop, service is excellent, staff friendly and courteous, rooftop restaurant is terrific", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "virgc24", "ReviewID": "UR105605313", "Content": "The rooms were very nice, the beds comfortable and the staff very friendly.

For 2 days the aircon wasn't workin properly and dispite it \"being fix\" 3 times the room remained 27/28 Celsius, and without a window to the outside it was very uncomfortable.
