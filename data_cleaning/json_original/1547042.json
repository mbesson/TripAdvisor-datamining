I was told at reception because my friend only had Australian identification he would not be counted as a second guest therefore all the perks would only be for one person with no compensation or refund. I said that a local friend could join me for these with local ID, then she claimed that the breakfast and brunch was actually only for 1 person despite my email clearly indicating for 2 people! They pretty much scammed me and cheated there. I had only checked my email after I returned home for this. I pretty much took her word since I didn't imagine they would lie to my face. Checkin was a horrible experience, their reception desk is right infront of a bar blasting out music so loud neither me nor the receptionist could hear each other. She then had the nerve to give me attitude over not hearing me despite that this is their problem? She actually huffed when I asked her to repeat a question since I have hearing problems and the music was so loud. She huffed loudly and paused, then gave me a dirty look like I was stupid and then continued to answer me. Overall was a nightmare to deal with, very rude. Also, the room service food was horrible was well. I've stayed in two star motorway hotels in the UK that offered better quality room service food. The rooms are great considering how much you pay. Good sized and great quality. Great value for money in that aspect. They are as good as some five stars I've been in. Only thing that might deter people is the music coming from the outdoor bar, but I expected that so it was not much of an issue. Overall rooms are great, but the experience and being scammed at checkin will ensure I never go back. I suggest you double check your package before booking anything to ensure what you are getting.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cHip hotel, like sleeping in a disco ball\u201d", "Author": "kgeresy", "ReviewID": "UR126244819", "Content": "well the design is what gets ur attention first, its really nice, makes you feel like being in a disco club, its a nice hotel, very hip , just beside the media city and very close to the marina where everything is happening well in short i would recommend it, if you like new designs", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Navi Mumbai, India", "Title": "\u201cGood business hotel and great value\u201d", "Author": "vcchicago", "ReviewID": "UR126130302", "Content": "Great location near Dubai Internet city.

The furniture is all customised for the rooms, but the graphic design on the walls let it down (another of the trying too hard to be trendy flaws).

The hotel was popular at the weekends, particularly the 'Dubai brunch' events it puts on. This was great for finishing up a hard week's work and for entertaining colleagues and friends, but was also one of the hotel's downsides as the music could be heard faintly through the multiple glazed windows facing the pool and it got a little busy in reception with 'worse for the wear' brunch guests.

If you care about the way a hotel presents itself, Media One appears to be managed by a hormonal teenage girl. The room service menu is filled with items with names like \"your schmuffaluffamouch breakfast\" (an omelet?), \"simple and understated, yet trendy\" (fruit), \"it's just so, so good\" (a pancake) and lengthy, overwrought definitions of words like \"breakfast\" and \"room service\".

I booked based on good recommendations from friends so perhaps I caught the hotel on a bad night. After negotiating Dubai's ever changing roadways and driving past the hotel twice with no clear way of accessing it, I drove aimlessly up to the unmarked front door. The gentleman at the front did not know enough English or Arabic to tell me that I would have to self-park so I just stood in front until another fellow came out to explain where to put my vehicle. Check in was friendly and quick. The room was as expected according to the photos. The TV wasn't working and I was told it was an issue with the telecom company. I ordered room service and didn't receive an item that I had asked for, even though I mentioned it three times while ordering. When room service arrived, the guy was surprised to see that my TV wasn't working. He called maintenance and they came a while later to fix it. Apparently it was not a telecom problem. I was exhausted from a long day so I thought I would take a bath and then get a good night's sleep. Two problems prevented that. First, the hot water would not come for the bathtub (though it worked for the shower). Second problem was the pool party outside my window. From what I could see, there wasn\u2019t a great turnout for the party so I\u2019m not sure why the music had to be so loud! At checkout they couldn\u2019t get the credit card machine to work so they processed the charges later and emailed me the receipt. They did get this part correct.

The package for the promotion is not entirely clear and we had to ask several times for an email confirmation however it does not really outline specifics of the package. It is only when you arrive at 6pm that they tell you that you cannot have access to the room until after 9 pm which we found odd and inconvenient. Drinks in the Z:one bar were quite watered down and as part of the package - very limited in choice. We were told we could not have red wine although eventually the staff offered to provide a glass when we asked if we could just pay for it instead of drinking weak vodka, lime and soda. Steak dinner in the Med was okay although the wine choice was a little rough. Service was very attentive and the staff really tried to anticipate your needs - the service was far better than the standard of food. It was ok - just ok - but nothing to really get excited about. It seems odd they would have a steak promotion but not have any mashed/jacket potatoes as choice in the very small buffet area. Dishes were not replenished regularly so some empty bowls were often seen. The hip room is of a reasonably good standard - 4 stars is appropriate here. Beds were comfortable and the bathroom area was spacious. Anything you needed was pretty much available in the room. We skipped breakfast in the hotel and came back to spend time at the pool. It's a decent sized pool but strangely there are no umbrellas to offer shade if you need it. The sun beds are great to lie on but really need to be cleaned each day as there was a thick layer of sand that discoloured the pool towel after you laid down on it. Brunch in the Med, was again very average in terms of food. Salads were the same as the night before or were clearly a creation of the left-overs from the night before. The service was again very attentive but the quality of the food was really quite average and bland. We were told we could order pizza as requested however when we went to order one, the guy refused and told us to take the pieces that were already there....and had been there for some time as they were cold. We wanted to take some time to just chill out in the room and catch up on some sleep, however this was not an easy task as the music from brunch could be heard and felt two floors up. Most disturbingly, we received at least 6 telephone calls during this time to the phone in our bathroom (yes, the toilet) from the reception staff. We complained about this as they seemed to call us to announce every visitor waiting in reception and so what did they do.....they arranged for IT support to call us on the phone in the bedroom to sort out our IT problem! At this point, we just decided to call it quits and head home. Essentially, the rooms are fine, food is very average and service is very good. The rooms and the service are worthy of 4 stars, the buffet food is not.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cwonderful experience...\u201d", "Author": "charise7", "ReviewID": "UR115072334", "Content": "We really love this hotel...perfect location, it is near in the beach and malls.

We were two in the room (and I paid more as we were two) but the room was equipped only for as a single room (only one soap, bathrobe etc.) Biggest problem is the noise. If they give you a room that faces the pool area, you better have earplugs with you as at night they have parties going on all night. Thursday night until 3 a.m. The walls are very thin and you hear everything, from outside and even when somebody accesses his room. All in all the hotel is \"OK\" but not convenient if you are on business and for holiday it is located not very convenient.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "raq138", "ReviewID": "UR82478297", "Content": "Stayed at Media one for 6 nights.

As i say, the staff were good, and did move me to a room on the opposite side of the hotel which was marginally quieter. So, bi-polar Media One? Well i think the management need to make a decision as the whether they are running a nightclub with a hotel attached, or a hotel with pool bar. As a business traveller, i dont want to be located next to a nightclub when i am trying to sleep. However, a day-time pool-party vibe would work for me if it didnt go on until 12am.

Although check-in went smoothly and courteously my first impression of the non-smoking room was that it smelled of stale smoke. I was initially glad to be overlooking the pool until I came back to my room after dinner to be greeted by the sound of thundering house music coming from the pool area. On looking out of the window it appeared there was a DJ playing to an empty pool bar. I used to review clubs and events for one of the world's biggest electronic music magazines so I'm not averse to this style of music, but he was mixing badly to an empty venue and really not selecting appropriate music. Moreover, I was on the 15th floor and even at this height the sound was intrusively loud enough to prevent sleep; on calling the reception they informed me this would go on until 3am. I really have to question whether hosting this type of event there is worth it for the hotel. I am guessing that, like myself, anyone who stays in any of the rooms that overlook the pool will be subject to the same intrusion. This is presumably an average 25% of their guests at any time(the hotel has 4 sides of which this is 1), if we assume that half of these people will be sufficiently upset by the noise that they will not return to the hotel then, on any given weekend, this setup is alienating approximately 12.5% of Media One's guests. If they are making a fortune from the pool bar that plays inappropriate music then this wouldn't be an issue, but the party looked rather poorly attended; meanwhile i'm sure the alienated guests will tell their friends and colleagues not to bother staying at Media One. What about playing some lounge music or laid back Jazz at tolerable levels, wouldn't that be more unique in Dubai's entertainment scene than another venue for hard commercial house music? I complained to the front desk and insisted I move room. They found me the same grade of room on the other side of the hotel luckily; had another room not been available then I have no idea how I would have coped with the noise and might have had to check-out. Having moved room I called down to the front desk several times since I had forgotten items in the first room. Despite calling 4 times the phone rang out and no reply came. Eventually I had to go downstairs to speak to the receptionist myself to arrange this. This was 1-30am, reception was deserted and I have no idea why it had not been possible to answer my calls over the previous half hour. The receptionist sent a concierge to escort me for the retrieval of my items. Previous comments mention the hotel's desperate attempts to be 'cool', whatever that means these days it certainly isn't going on at Media One. I would echo previous reviewers and feel the property really needs to sort out what it wants to be. Is it a business property serving visitors to the TECOM developments, or is it some sort of urban party venue for early 20 somethings that want to drink excessively? If it is the former then management need to rein-in what are apparently attempts to be the latter; life in the hotel seems to take place to a constant backdrop of loud commercial house music; it's in the lobby, the lift, at breakfast, by the pool - is it necessary to be constantly exposed to this? Looking at the guests who came into breakfast the majority are businessmen and women who aren't there for some sort of sauced-up Ibiza weekend meanwhile the hotel's atmosphere, Friday brunch and bars all seem aimed at bringing-in a crowd of wannabe reality TV contestants that you can observe staggering wastedly in and out of the lobby on a Friday evening. Of course, cherry-picking these two demographics wouldn't be an issue if servicing one of them didn't come at the detriment of pleasing the other. But, after overhearing conversations at breakfast, I know for a fact I won't be the only one not returning to Media One. I hope that pool party makes them enough money to compensate for the fact they will have very few repeat guests.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Media One Hotel Dubai", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1547042-Reviews-Media_One_Hotel_Dubai-Dubai.html", "Price": "$109 - $329*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Dubai Media City, Plot No. 1</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Behind American University</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">121818 </span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1547042", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/66/71/44/hotel-exterior.jpg"}}
