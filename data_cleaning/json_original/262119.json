The chap who was on reception when we arrived & during the day was great! very friendly, helpful & informative. The room safe was free & it worked. The tv worked. The hairdryer worked as long as you kept it on the low setting, otherwise it cut out. The sheets & the towels were clean. The shower was warm. I'm afraid that's where the positives end. NEGATIVES - We had a room for 3, myself, my hubby & my son who is just 7. The room was very small, narrow and very basic. The plain magnolia paintwork was scuffed, the carpet was stained, sticky & looked dirty, the windows & window frames were covered with black mould. There were 3 'single' beds, I say single but they were only a little over 2 feet wide, and my husband who is 5' 11\" had his feet dangling out of the end. The \"wardrobe\" & clothes storage area was piteously inadequate for 3 people if you planned to stay for more than 1 or 2 nights. The mini fridge never got cool. According to the hotel details the room was supposed to have a sitting area, this comprised of one canteen type chair stuck in a corner. There was a large mirror on the wall, but no dressing table or even a shelf for you to put your cosmetics on. I ended up using the 'canteen' chair in the 'sitting area'. One of the wall lights didn't work. The tea/coffee/kettle tray was on a storage area above the fridge, but there was no socket to plug it into, so we ended up having to put it on the floor next to the nearest plug socket. Not ideal when you have a boisterous 7 year old in the room! The bathroom was pretty average, it could have done with a good scrub and the shower leaked all over the floor so we had to bung toilet tissue into corners of the shower tray where it hadn't been sealed properly, and there was no bath mat. The breakfast room was self service, basic & chaotic! You had to fight for a table, then battle with all the other grumpy looking tourists to help yourself to the breakfast which comprised of bread rolls or toast (the toaster we used barely warmed the bread even when I put it through twice) cornflakes, boiled eggs, slices of cheese, orange juice, coffee/tea, jam.

As previously stated, the room was quite well equipped: electronic safe, telephone, a fridge (empty), hair dryer, tea making facility and complimentary tea, heating, flat screen television, shower and bath kit, an independent bathroom that was by the way very small and ugly (see picture). The common spaces are very few: a lobby in front of reception which was very very small, and the breakfast room where you can take breakfast from 7.30 to 9.30 which could definitely be improved. The hotel also offers wi-fi internet, for an extra charge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c i haven't tried this.

The bedroom was horrible and here are the reasons why: 3 single narrow beds, 1 had dirty bedding, no quilts, just bobbly blankets, dirty walls, light switches that didn't work, stained carpets, tiny bathroom, shower not big enough to move at all, moldy shower curtain, rusty shower rail (very), window that didn't lock and kept falling down, conservatory plastic corrugated roof (in the bedroom) which meant I didn't sleep because of the rain, lights that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work (bulbs gone), bedroom door that had an inch gap meaning lots of light in the room, cold draft (presumably from the roof) thin walls.

Then I checked the bedsheets and they had stains, but worst of all was the duvet had not been washed and was covered in crusty food the size of your hand matted into the duvet - disgusting.

I got out of the lift and was greeted by a repugnant smell that can only be described as wet carpet, that had been washed with a dirty cloth, and left to dry slowly. Fine I thought, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just get into my room and shut it out. No such luck \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my room smelled exactly the same. Give it a chance I thought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll open the window and let it air out. 2 hours later though the smell was as bad as ever, so I went up to ask reception to move me. Instead they sent down two extraordinarily unhelpful members of staff, who pretended not to smell anything, then proceeded to spray the whole floor with heavily scented air freshener as soon as I closed my door. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 My door, ah yes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my door which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lock. I asked the unhelpful maintenance man to please fix my lock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to which he replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need, only you have a key.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yes, I said, but they are keycards, and staff can programme them to access any room they like. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, only you have a key\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I could see I was not getting anywhere with the man, so instead I had to barricade myself in my room using the spare bed and a makeshift door-wedge. Not the safe, comfortable environment a woman travelling on her own wants to experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The shower, apart from being covered in mould around the bottom seals, was so small that I had to stand with my tummy against the wall to stop the freezing cold curtain sticking to my back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a size 8, so god knows how anyone of any size or stature is meant to fit in there. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The hairdryer broke within 10 seconds of using it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 None of the plugs fit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to boil the kettle I had to sit under the table pushing the plug in.

After arriving around 4pm (From France) we were told our room was not ready for another hour. No problem, off to the pub. When we returned the hotel the manager who was on duty, informed us our room was \"A little on the small side compared to those in Australia\", we acknowledged his honesty and proceeded down the road to our room (Our room was in another building 3 doors down the road). When we entered the room we were speechless (I can't write what I said, may be offensive) the room had a double bed and a shelf with a safe (not screwed down, more on that later) and thats it. Yes, there was a bathroom, and I kid you not, we thought of sleeping in there as it was larger than the bedroom. We could not put our cases on the floor to open them up as there was not enough floor space. I went to the reception and advised our disappointment and was meet with a \"This is London, Not Sydney\" responce. We had no option as we had prepaid the room. After we got settled (approx. 1 minute, as there is not much to do in a shoe box) we put our passports etc in the safe. This seemed to work well, but when I checked to ensure it was locked I nearly pulled it off the shelf. Upon closer inspection I noticed it was not secured down, there were scews there but had come loose. I again went to reception to obtain a screwdriver as I am quite capable of fixing this & I knew it would take forever for them to do it. \"I'm sorry, we don't have a scewdriver available, I'll get someone to fix it, tommorrow\" The next day we went sight seeing (The hotel location is perfect, right next to Earl's court station) after returning, we found our ground floor window was wide open and allowed very easy access for any would-be-thief to get in and steal our property, including our safe, which of course, was not fixed and luckily we never left anything in there. After this incident I went across the road to the Best Western hotel to obtain a room as it looked pretty good from the outside. I asked to see the room which was perfect, but they had no vacancies for our stay (I told them I was coming back in a couple of weeks, soory I lied, I just wanted to see the room), very well appointed, clean, fresh and only about 20 pounds a night dearer. I could go on & on about how incompetent and unhelpful the Oxford hotel is, but I think you get the message. Please, check in to the Best Western across the road (Can't remember the name, but easy to find) and you will enjoy your stay a lot more.

The corridors are quite narrow but I suppose this is due to the age of the building, Our room was a decent size. It was 2 two single beds put together to form a double, I must admit the first thing I did was check the bedding after some of the reports on here but it very clean and the mattress seemed fairly new. The only down size was that we only had one pillow each, The room was warm at times but there was a fan directed towards to the bed which was quite powerful. The bathroom was rather strange as it was a wet room with the shower directly over the toilet! I had worries about flooding the room but all the water did seem to escape down the drain, thankfully! Overall the room was small but clean and to be honest we hardly spent any time there as we were enjoying the sights in London, The breakfast is ok if you like toast but it was adequate. There was also tea, coffee and orange juice available and for \u00c2\u00a365 a night with breakfast it is great value. The location is fantastic. Literally a 30 second walk from Earls Court tube station and this line will take you straight to central London, There are numerous bars and restaurants located in the vicinity.

Don't stay here - you would be safer and more comfortable sleeping on a park bench!. This hotel is advertised as \"an attractive & well appointed hotel, newly refurbished to a very high standard and situated in the heart of the West End\" The only true thing is about the location. I arrived about 9.30 pm on a Wednesday night after a full day of travel from Europe. I was returning to Australia the next day so just wanted a room in an area of London I was familiar with - having earlier in my trip stayed with friends at Kensington. I was given room G5 which was just to the right of reception. The layout of the rooms in this area is difficult to negotiate - holding doors open while trying to squeeze yourself and luggage in as well as open the door to your room. Room had three single beds and bathroom. The window opened on to another area of the hotel so it could not be opened. Air Conditioning didn't work either. The carpet was very old as it was hard, stained and tacky. In the morning I discovered live bed bugs and captured one under a glass, while I went out to see management. I was told by male receptionist he could not do anything as he was not the manager and the manager would be in at 11.00 am. he sent two cleaners around Adel (male) and Laura to confirm that bed bugs were present. I asked them not to touch the bug as I wanted to show the hotel management - however Adel promptly squshed the bug so it was barely recognisable. At this time a smelled a rat. The manager Marco - apparently arrived earlier than 11 but did not bother to come and see me when he arrived, but I approached reception again closer to check out time. Marco insisted that all the mattresses were special type which would kill any bed bugs and he also insisted the room had only been refurbished 1.5 years ago. I challenged him on this pointing out the condition of the carpet and also the mattress where the button like things are were frayed etc. On inspecting the mattress there were no markings on mattress to indicate it had any microbiological properties but only then discovered blood and other bodily fluid stains to which I gasped with a horrified look saying this is disgusting. Marco also had a bit of a shocked look on his face but was not moving from his position that the room was clean & newly refurbished. but then to my shock and horror accused me of bringing the bed bugs in because Australian hotels are rampant with them. He then also accused me of simply wanting a free night in London. I asked him several times if he would be happy paying 75 pound to sleep with bed bugs to which I got no response except further accusations. Marco said before anything was done he would contact the mattress company and have them investigate. I said that won't do me any good as I was returning home (to my own home own bed that does't have bed bugs!) . Marco also said that he has been with the hotel for 23 years and he has never had a report of bed bugs. However that is a lie as a review on this website also has a customer who discovered bed bugs. Customer service is non-existent and intimidation tactics are high. I say this because two large male staff and a female staff member and then little old me were in the room discussing this issue - I did get anywhere - not even a partial refund but the real point is management accepted absolutely no responsibility just blamed the consumer - the people that are keeping food on their tables.

We have not been to London before, so we did not have any idea to choose which hotel. We chose this hotel only due to the reviews shown in trip advisor. Thus, after we back from London, we would like to share our experience. The location of the hotel is very good definitely, just less than five minutes walk from earl's court tube station which can find a step-fee way to the tube, so it is not difficult for us to find the way to the hotel and take so many luggages to the hotel. I think earl's court is convenient for travellers since it is not far away from the Heathrow Airport and London Center (it is the margin station in zone 1 and most sighting-seeing places are in zone 1). Also, it is easy to find many different types of restaurants and shops nearby, for example, burger king, mac donald, chinese food, indian food, bar, italian restaurant, south east asia food and western food, etc. Also, there are some convenient shops for you to buy daily necessaries. Overall, we think the location is excellent with such budget. After we checked in into the hotel, the staff arranged a room in another new building to us. But it seems that the building was not finished its furnishing and rennovation works as shown in our room and at that building. Our room is at the ground floor and it is the last room near the little garden (it should be little garden after furnishing, but all furnishing equipments were in that garden when we stayed. Some workers works in day time. That made us feel a little bit unsafe when we opened the windows but we are out of rooms). All the furnishing works should be finished before giving customers to stay. The most important was that we cannot use wifi at all in our room even we paid for that. Since internet connection is important for us, so we requested a change of our room, but unluckily all rooms have been fully booked at that night (since it was a Sat Night, we can understand). Afterwe told to the staff for a few times, we changed to another room finally at the building with reception counter there. Of course, we can access to the internet finally after move in to that room. For room and facilities, we both think that the room size is okay for us (both two rooms we stayed) and it is enough for putting our large luggages (total we got 2 large luggages and two bags). The room is clean and tidy. The bed is comfortable. Since it is newly rennovated, it looks new and it is what we want (we dont want to find a very old hotel to stay). We think that the facilities are basic but enough for us. Only the table in room and washing basin in toliet are too small for putting our stuff. For breakfast, even it was included in the room rate, we only tried once in five days since there were too little choices, only breads, cheese, butter, jams, corn flakes, milk, and coffee and tea. It was too crowded to have so many people to line up to get these food in a small room. I did not expect a full english breakfast, but there were too little chioces (at least i expected some eggs and sausages as well). Thus, we just ate breakfasts outside the hotel. The staff is polite and nice. Although we asked so many times for changing a room and it is trouble to arrange another room for us, they helped us two days after finally. Also, we would like to know the way to windsor castle, they were nice to teach us the way. Please note that there were little charge for putting the luggages after check out (but my booking agent said it was free of charge). Overall, the hotel is good in location and it is basic, clean and tidy. With such budget, we are satisfied with the hotel totally. We will recommend for our friends to stay when travelling in London.

Reception staff are a vital part of any hotel business and I have to say that, having stayed there week after week, I have always - without exception - found the staff helpful and friendly. I do not have breakfast there, so I cannot comment on that, neither have I ever tangled with any wildlife in the beds. I have always been very pleased that the hotel uses white cotton sheets and white towels. I think the people who had a bad experience in that department were just terribly unlucky. The Oxford is a split-site hotel and one section has been recently completely renovated while the other is now undergoing the same process. The rooms in the updated section are very clean and bright with new carpets, curtains, beds, televisions, hairdryers, a safe and upgraded bathrooms. The back garden, which was once just a tangle of brambles, now has decking and shrubs and some seating. While few guests will have time to sit out there, it is still nice to glimpse an attractive garden out of the window.

I had done my research and had decided not to stay here because of the reviews, but my reservations at another hotel, the St. Mark Hotel not far away and with the same owner, fell through and they put us up here for one night. The staff was extremely nice, a striking contrast to our experience at the St. Mark, and we were allowed to check in right away at 10:30 AM instead of having to wait till the customary 1 PM . Because it was last minute, we stayed in a twin room, which had two single beds, a small shower and a sink in the room, and the toilet was down the hall. We were on the fourth floor, which was a bit of a struggle since there was no lift. The room was very clean, but a bit run down and tiny, you could tell the place was old, I guess I would equate it to staying in a dorm room. The toilet was interesting, as Americans, this was our first encounter with having to flush by pulling a string, but we were more amused than anything. The TV was up high with no remote and the volume knob was broken, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to London to watch TV. The beds were a bit hard but not unbearable. I saw no signs of bedbugs. Breakfast was simple; you sit in the back room looking out at the garden and are served cereal, toast, tea and coffee, you can have as much as you want. In terms of noise, we could hear people walking the halls but not in their rooms, and the street was quiet so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear traffic or people on the street. The gentleman checking us in was SO nice, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about him, he knew the area very well, gave us a free map, advice, directions, and he spoke at least three languages. It is very close to Earls Court Station, which was convenient.

I stayed one night with my husband, & he flew back to America, & on my return home, I stayed there myself. Both times I stayed in the annex. I thought the hotel was charming w/ the high stairs & windows, something not typical of our big American hotels. We had to push two twin beds together, which is typical in Europe. The rooms had a hot water aparatus for tea, etc. that did not work very well. A TV up high. I think I had to manually change the channel, w/ just a few channels. The bathrooms were fine. The first time, it was rather large, the second time, somewhat smaller, both with a large, deep tub. I have stayed in all kinds of hotels, & prefer something nicer, but this fit the bill, as London hotels were all something like $150 at the time, & this was like $50. I was nervous because of the price, but I liked it. It was in a charming neighborhood. We walked down the block & saw through beutiful windows w/ x-mas trees & mercedes & beamers parked in front. Earl's court is a few minutes walk, w/ fun pubs & restaurants. And the metro is fairly easy to get to the highlights of London. Although on my short overnight stays I only took it to Buckinham palace & down near the tower bridge, I think? The staff were foreign, well not English, a little dry, but helpful. We had an early check-out, & they had an early breakfast for us. If I remember, it was cornflakes, water OJ, & the like, but not bad. American hotels don't usually provide breakfast anyway. This place was clean, no dust bunnies, in a good neighborhood, & I thought it had \"english charm.\" I would choose it again w/ the prices in London. The location was good & it was a good value for your $. A steal, really. Although, I would prefer to vacation the majority of my stay somewhere where the dollar is better & I would get a better hotel, comfort level, for my $. But for a night or two, this place was fine.

Our group was sent to a sepearte building down the street, where once we got there, we had to drag our suitcases up 3 and 4 flights of steep dusty stairs. When we got to our room and opened the door it looked as if someone had smoked a pipe in there for 50 years, and the bed covers were shredded in places! The towels had stains on, and the windows were actually falling out. On our window it said don't open wide- open it at all and half of it dropped off it's hinges! In another room they had a door handle screwed side ways onto the window and it wouldn't shut for the latch! The bathroom had holes in the walls and in one hole was a mans shirt sleeve!? The toilet smelt as if it hadn't been cleaned in months, and the floor was so dusty you couldn't take your shoes off. The bedroom had a 70's wooden TV that was practically hanging off the wall and the wardrobe consisted of 3 hangers on a pole. Behind one of the beds, the dust was so thick on the carpet it was like a rug! One of my last moans was on the day we left, we were charged a \u00c2\u00a310 deposit per room for the keys (3 rooms) on the first day- fine, but on the last day we were told we would only recieved half back ,because we wanted to put our cases in the 'luggage room'.
