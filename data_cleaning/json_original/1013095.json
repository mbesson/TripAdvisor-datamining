On asking I was offered express laundry which did come back to me after one day. Seriously at over 200 euros a night how hard is it to have one shared iron???????

I must say that this hotel is perfectly placed with easy access to just about everywhere in the city. The room was well equipped and very very clean. The view of the Bosphorus from the room is fantastic. Dining services are great too; good variety of food, excellent service. Having your breakfast in their restaurant with stunning views of the Bosphorus is just relaxing, let alone the attentive restaurant staff who don't give you the chance to call them if you need anything as they unobtrusively take care of you. As for getting about, the metro is easy, cheap and very near, the famous Taksim Square and Istiklal street are two minutes away where masses of shops (branded), small bazzars, cafes and restaurants fill the area. Internet is super-fast and they gave us free wireless access throughout our stay. I don't know if this was part of my package or they do this to all guests. Unlike other hotels where you get a single password which you can only use to access Internet through only one device, in Gezi Hotel they were very generous and happily gave us three access points for my iPhone, my laptop and my wife's iPad! Staff offer exceptional service without being over the top and they all seem genuinely pleased to be working here. I would especially like to thank the front office team, who were very friendly and efficient; had a good check-in and out experience and they were very helpful throughout my stay. My special thanks go to Ms. Dilhan G\u00c3\u00b6kmen who graced us with her smile every morning and helped us with her experience and advice in getting around Istanbul.

The personnel are very polite and helpful. A couple of months ago when I was searching for a hotel to stay in Istanbul I came in contact with the hotel to ask some questions about internet access etc and they were very helpful, answering me straight away. We also received a free upgrade for a Bosphorus view room which was one of the most positive parts of our stay! The restaurant is indeed very good, although Istanbul has many good places for food I would recommend for someone to have dinner in the restaurant once during their stay. Breakfast was fine, it lasts until 10.30 strictly (after that in about 5-10 minutes everything is gone!). The only negative experience we had, was that our room had a bad smell sometimes coming from the bathroom. I had not contacted the management about this as by the time we came back at the room the first time we were very tired to short this out and then the next time that happened was during our last night and we left the next day. I am not sure if they could do much though as the smell was coming from the sewage. The ventilation was not working. The room was contemporary decorated and the bathroom had a lovely marble finishing. And just a tip for the management which may be looked at, the pillows were either very big (I believe these were the decorative pillows) or very small (the actual sleeping pillows), none was very convenient. The hotel is located close to the metro station and close to restaurants & shops. Internet access is fast in the lobby & restaurant. There is free internet access in the rooms but as we were on the 7th floor the signal was not strong. As previously said all hotel personnel was very polite and helpful.

Hotel is located in the Taksim region, closest to the best shopping with a host of great restaurants. The hotel is strategically located next to the metro and bus stops enabling easy transportation to all the renowned sites in Istanbul, if you are looking at getting around for less. We utilized a taxi service organized by the concierge, which arrived in less than two minutes. We utilized the hotel's Bistro on the first floor for dinner our first night, excellent food and service as the weather was less than desirable and after several flight delays, chose to stay in our first night. We had two entrees and two salads with a bottle of Chilean wine for fifty bucks each with tip. The waiters were at our side constantly refreshing our wine glasses, providing fresh bread and clearing the last course. We could not have asked for more. Rooms are beautifully decorated with the finest decor - and the hotel is new. We had a garden room with a patio, unfortunately it was too cold to take advantage of the outdoor seating set aside for our room. Property is non-smoking as seems to be the case in most hotels and all restaurants now in Istanbul. I am sure there is not a problem during the summer when outdoor seating is available. The hotel has 11+ floors, ours was named the 1st floor but in all actuality, was located four floors below the lobby. The only setback was that the room was a bit cold as the temperatures over the weekend were below 10 degrees Celsius with wicked wind gusts. Therefore, there was a draft and floors were cold in the room and bathroom/shower as they are marble. We requested a second key to keep the heating running during our absence from the room which kept the temperature comfortable. I would suggest having a room on a higher floor. The rate we paid was exceptionally low for this class of hotel, so no complaints there. Our room came with breakfast which was excellent with a full array of cold cuts, cheeses, eggs, salads, Turkish pastries, coffee, tea and cereals, anything for any taste. Service was terrific. All in all, an excellent establishment and we would highly recommend. KUDOS to Kemel at the door, he was extremely helpful as was the receptionist considerate.

The spa in the hotel is very nice too, there is a small sauna and steam room and while we where there for the weekend there weren't that many people at all, so it was practically like a private spa. I didn't do any treatments but there was a wide variety and the prices were reasonable. The breakfast was also very nice, is was situated on the ground floor with a view of the Bosphorus river, since the hotel is slightly on a hill and with a wide variety of food. There was everything from traditional turkish cheeses, pain au chocolat, a lot of dried fruit and delicious turkish coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. The staff was very friendly and fluent in English. The location of this hotel is very central for that side of Istanbul, it's located right in Taksim Square, a 5 minute walk to the metro or a 10 minute ride to the old town. There is a huge shopping street located close by on which there are currency exchange points, restaurants and many stores. Also the majority of the modern restaurants are close by the hotel.
