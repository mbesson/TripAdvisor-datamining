Staff were very helpful upon check-in and we needed some extra assist. We loved the location which was close to the 911 memorial, Seaport, Trinity Church and Wall St. Great location for crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and enjoying some of Brooklyn as well as close to multiple subway stops on Fulton St. The room was large by Manhattan standards, bed was comfortable, and bathroom one of the cleanest we had seen in the city. As to someones comment about no top sheet, the comforter was covered with sheets and I found the sheets of good quality which is also becoming harder to find in Manhattan. Our one minor issue was that we were placed in a room on the Platt St. side of the building which is where trash trucks seem to load trash and recycables from a neighboring building for two hours at a time. They actually were loading two trucks at a time with the noise of constant compacting. We were only on the 4th floor so it made it difficult to listen to the TV or each other from 8-10 pm. It was also going on during the daytime but the good news is that it stopped around 10 pm so no problem sleeping.

Bad idea. Because when I tried to redeem it, they told me they were out of the \"class\" of rooms that were on the coupon for the date I wanted. The coupon offered two upgrades for the price, so I told them I would be happy to take a lower grade room. They were happy to book me in a lower grade room. But for a HIGHER PRICE. Then I asked them what rooms they had available. They told me they only had premium rooms. That was the room grade on the coupon. When I told them that, they said they didn't have those available, they only had suites available. Then I asked them why they were offering me a lower grade room. They kept changing the story. I should have took the hint and booked somewhere else, but I went ahead and paid the extra money. Mind you, I was supposed to get free WiFi and free continental breakfast with the coupon, but since I got the LOWER GRADE room for a HIGHER PRICE, they were not going to honor the coupon. So I called Travelzoo and got a refund. When I got to the hotel, they were nice enough and the hotel was pretty and the decorations were nice. However. The room was just ok. First thing. Why didn't they have a top sheet? That is just unsanitary. Who knows if they wash those comforters every day. Second. There is no coffee maker in the room. If you want your morning cup of joe, you better be prepared to go downstairs and pay a full $15.00 for their continental breakfast, which consists of some cereal, a little fruit, a few danishes and some juice. And coffee. I just wanted the coffee. So I grabbed a cup and went upstairs to my room. I didn't pay for it, figured it was the least they could give me. Last, but certainly not least, they have NO RESTAURANT ON THE WEEKENDS. Who closes their restaurant on weekends? I was looking forward to a night in with some delicious four star food. Room service? Nope. They brought up some menus. One of the places was closed already and it was only 8pm. ??!! We eventually ordered from grubhub. I wanted room service because I wanted china and real utensils and a decent meal. I will never go to this place again. Ever. They spend a lot of money on aesthetics and failed to spend the pocket change it would have cost to have a top sheet, a coffee maker, and some damn food.

Although we had pre-paid for rooms and continental breakfast for the duration of our stay, we had to leave a deposit of $50 per room per night, which was not the usual card swipe, be warned, I had taken a pre-paid Mastercard with me with our spending money on it and was not told the money is actually authorised from the card and reserved against any charges, which meant I was $200 down immediately (Incidentally even though we have been back home for 5 days - those funds have still not been released on my card, I was told by the hotel they would be back on the card the evening of the day we checked out!) The Rooms were nicely decorated, the view was looking directly into the apartments opposite [we were room 143 on the 14th floor], our friends room was opposite ours and their view was of a construction site, which was noisy during the week [forget a late sleep in!] The bed was comfortable and room very clean, the ipod dock alarm clock was a great idea, as was the safe for valuables. Unfortunately the restaurant was shut on the weekends - the lobby bar was open, prices were good $5 for a Stella Artois [\u00a33.25 same as UK], Bottle of Corona was a bit expensive $7 [about \u00a34.50] - it is also customary to tip $1 per drink on top. It was perfectly safe to walk around at night, you can always flag down a taxi, they were cheaper than back home, we took a trip to Little Italy, it cost $8. If you stay in and around the hotel on the weekends, be prepared for it to be quiet, we went to Jim Brady's Irish Bar/Restaurant around the corner at 8:30 Saturday night and there were only 2 other people there! [food was nice and not expensive, the barman even put the football on the TV for us]. For some nice bars try Stone Street, about a 5 minute walk! Most beers are $5-$8 (included imported and 'fancy' beers - such as white beers], wine is more $9-$11 a glass, and that's the cheap stuff. Breakfast at the hotel wasn't great, we had pre-paid for their continental breakfast at $15 per person per day, but for that all you had was 1 piece of toast and jam and a small serving of fresh fruit, your $15 (\u00a310) did not included tea/coffee/juice [approx $5 each] or service charge at 18% - so even though we had pre-paid for our breakfast(which was a meager portion for $60 per day for 4 of us - approx \u00a340) we were then presented with a bill for almost $16 (just over \u00a310) for bringing us 4 slices of toast and fruit! [On Sunday - there was nobody working the kitchen and we helped ourselves from a selection in the bar area, there was no service charge and we took as much as we wanted - much better idea!] After Monday morning, we found an excellent deli around the corner 'Lane's Deli' where the owner (Gabe) and his staff offered an excellent breakfast, a huge selection and great prices - we had our fill of toast, bacon, eggs, juice and tea for around $7-$8 each [\u00a35], for the rest of our stay we cut our losses with the continental breakfast at the hotel and ate there! [they also had a huge choice for lunches and dinners and the food was great and cheap!][they will even do you a packed lunch to take out for the day]. Taxis : We arrived at JFK and straight away someone tried to scam us with a fixed taxi fare of $68 to take us to our hotel in lower Manhattan! Make sure you ONLY get a taxi off the rank - the flat rate to any hotel/location is $45 + tolls [approx $6] - we paid $51 for our journey which took about 45 mins. When we returned to the airport on Wednesday we paid just $45 flat rate as the tolls are only one-way [we left in evening rush hour and it took 1hr 20 mins - allow plenty of time]. You don't have to agree a price, it's all on the meter. Also, whilst at the hotel the doorman got us a taxi one evening, when we arrived at our destination the driver added $4 onto the cost of our $8 journey, because the doorman had taken a ride from the main road back to our hotel and not paid the driver [annoying!] - moral: get your own taxi, there's loads around. Trains : we purchased a metrocard which gives unlimited train, underground and bus travel for 7 days for $29 [\u00a320], the underground [subway] was easy to use. Make sure you get a streetmap at the hotel, it is really simple to use and you can find your nearest subway station from various attractions. Attractions: Arrive early - and avoid the queues, a New York CityPass is a money saving idea, we purchased ours online before we travelled and they cost \u00a352 each - we used ours to see Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Ferry Trip, Museum of Natural History, Metropolitan Museum, Museum of Modern Art and we ran out of time but could have gone to the observation deck of the Rockerfeller Building. People: are amazingly friendly and helpful - every time we pulled out our map someone would stop and ask if we needed help or where we were looking to go. Would I go back to NY? - yes definitely Would I stay at this hotel again? - probably not, I'd go somewhere more uptown!", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGild Hall should not be classified as a 4 star hotel.\u201d", "Author": "annonomous1", "ReviewID": "UR124870025", "Content": "The gild hall is a cheap price for manhattan, but so is every hotel in the financial district.

This was a little surprising and really threw off our expectations of this hotel. I'm not sure if it's normal to have your cellular phone with you at reception but this has never happened to me before anywhere else. I later asked one of the gentlemen bellhops (who were very helpful in fetching cabs and attending to bags) if this was normal and they said that she was the manager. What's next was even more surprising to me and my husband. For some reason 3 out of the 5 times we visited the desk, the girls were barefoot!!

Lastly, the Libertine restaurant. While they actually have good food. The service was terrible! The waitress would disappear into a room behind a closet and we would have to wait for her to come out to order something or get a check. It took exceptionally long for us to receive our food, about 45 minutes for a hamburger.

My two main gripes - the bathroom, while well appointed had a few minor frustrations. First, there is no bathroom fan. This can be less than ideal for showering as it results in an overly steamy bathroom but also, and this might seem funny, but there is a certain degree of privacy afforded by the bathroom fan. Especially when the bathroom and the 'living space' is less than 5 feet away from one another. The bathroom door itself also didn't close very well and had 'ribbed' glass so my fiance laughed that he could see me through it. Finally, the fancy design of the shelves didn't really allow toiletry bags to fit properly and the sink was a pedestal design which didn't help with storage either. Secondly, for a rather refined hotel, the connecting restaurant, Libertine, was a major disappointment. We received a voucher for 20% off and even so felt we grossly overpaid for substandard food. Several things we asked for were unavailable that evening, including french fries and a few appetizers. Because we were on a 'splurge trip' we got dessert despite a fairly disappointing meal and the sorbets were half melted, which our server pointed out by saying 'yeah they are kind of melted but you have spoons...\" The restaurant also felt fairly run down - the sticky bar feeling that I associate with university days rather than a NYC hotel.

The hotel is definitely a boutique, which I like. I get bored with the \"standard\" hotel feel sometimes and look forward to the surprise of a boutique. The lobby is well appointed with an adjoining restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (We have had breakfast a few times in the restaurant - it's pretty slow - so if you're in a hurry you may want to opt for another venue.) In the evening, the restaurant turns into a hopping bar scene. I was really surprised because it's so sleepy during the day. Not bad, however, it added a nice vibe when walking into the lobby in the evening. The staff is always very helpful and the service has been great. The rooms are comfortable and well decorated. I love the \"buckle\" detail on the leather headboards. I was surprised at how spacious the rooms were - especially for NYC. The bathroom is tiny, however. It's a \"one person\" space. But . . . with very nice detail. I thought the glass door separating the main room from the bathroom was very posh. However, I read some reviews where others said they didn't like it. I had a king size room both times I've stayed. Both rooms were directly off the elevator and I think they're a bit larger. I was worried about it being loud due to the close proximity of the elevators - but trust me - I heard nothing. Not even the \"all night noise\" that is typical in NYC. Maybe it's because my room faces into another building - very close! Just keep your blinds closed and you'll be fine. There's plenty of drawer and closet space and a neat mini bar area. The only negative (besides the slow service in the kitchen) is that both times I stayed at the hotel my room keys (all 3) became demagnitized almost daily. I swear I didn't have them next to my cell phone. I had to go to the front desk often to have them rekeyed. If you want to workout I'd recommend Crunch Fitness. It's two blocks away. They charge $15/day if you show you hotel key. Also, for awesome, healthy food - try Energy Kitchen. Also just a few blocks away. Nothing is over 500 calories. They open at 7:30am for breakfast, too.

Other than that my room was spectacular. My stay over all could've been better. I went to the Libertine Restaurant which is a part of Gild Hall and I wish I didn't. I called them every 10 minutes for about an hour before I planned on arriving and no one ever picked up the phone. When I finally went down I was told there was a 25min wait. Which I could've avoided if they picked up the phone. So after the 25min wait turned into 40min, I was upset and went for a walk. walking past the restaurant window I noticed there were three open tables.

Gild Hall exceeded our expectations - the only thing lacking was the dining service/areas and lack of free internet, described below, which resulted in a 4-star review rather than 5-stars. Location: A little hard to find, but as long as you know that the main entrance isn't actually on Gold Street, you'll be fine. Most cabbies had no problem getting us back to the hotel after nights on the town once we said it was across the street from Harry's Italian restaurant (GREAT pizza and open late, by the way) and two blocks from the Seaport. The subway is just one block away from the hotel, a gourmet food/convenience store is located a few doors down, and there's a Starbucks less than a block away. For us, it was the perfect locale, in an area with numerous restaurants/shops, sans the crowds, near both the subway and a quick 5-minute walk to the Seaport. Design: The design of this hotel is perfect; the interior looks like a cross between a cushy boutique and the library of a mountain lodge. The staff is well-trained and attentive. We never saw the person providing daily maid service to our room the entire time we were there, but no matter what odd hour we departed/returned our room was made and there was fresh ice. The bedding was comfortable, the room was fair-sized for a hotel room in the city, and there was plenty of storage space. The bathroom had a shower only, but the fixtures were attractive, clean, and modern. The only thing I'd change about the room setup is that the entire wall between the bedroom and bathroom is frosted glass - in other words, if someone is using the restroom and you're in the bedroom, you can see (almost completely) and hear through the bathroom's opaque wall, offering VERY little privacy. The hotel boasts a second floor bar, but we never ventured there. When we returned from our nights out, we entered the lobby (which is partially open to the 2nd floor bar area staircase) and were greeted by deafening Top 40 music selections. The guests we saw staying at this hotel ranged in age from mid-40s to late 60s; in general, not the type of clientele who appreciate top 40 music and certainly not music blared so loud that conversation is difficult just one floor below. On the up side, we couldn't hear the music from our room on the 12th floor. On the down side, we did not - at all - entertain the idea of checking out the bar for an after-dinner drink. Food service: There is no room service, but the hotel has a small restaurant open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We ate breakfast in the hotel the first morning after we arrived. The restaurant had 2 customers when we came downstairs at 8:30 AM, but we waited almost 10 minutes to be seated. Our waitress brought out the wrong food twice; she did not write our order down and the cook ended up coming out himself to take our order. In all, it took almost an hour from the time we ordered to get two correct omelets delivered to our table, one with ham and cheese, one with mushroom and spinach. The food was delicious, but the waitress was definitely sub-par. We spoke to the registration desk and they immediately removed the breakfast charges from our bill; the very apologetic and very efficient customer service desk absolutely made up for the annoyance of breakfast, but we didn't eat another meal in the hotel during our visit. Additionally, if you plan to work at all when you arrive at the hotel, keep in mind that you'll have to pony up $9.99/day for internet service. We opted for our cell phones and free internet at Starbucks on the two occasions we needed access during our trip. Even with the minor annoyances, we will likely stay at Gild Hall again. I never would have imagined that you could walk out of a hotel in NYC at midnight and feel like you're in an abandoned city. The location is ultra-quiet, free of crowds, the decor is fabulous and the hotel is kept exceptionally clean, the customer service is outstanding (one waitress aside) and it's a wonderful jumping-off point for whatever you might be planning to do in any section of the city.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hicksville, New York", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely loved my stay.

At Gild Hall, a boutique hotel, allows me to forget that space is an issue. Booked a king bed on the 5th floor and would return on my next visit. Here's why: + The room is pretty big. I had a king bed and it fit the bed without my having to skirt around it. Plenty of room to lay out luggage, get dressed, and just move around in general. + Bathroom is pretty modern and clean. Great water pressure. Slip into the Frette robe and wash up. + Flatscreen TV, desk, window seats, are all part of the room + Don't like \"gym\" then Crunch Fitness is only $10. I didn't use Crunch since I just needed a treadmill. \"Gym\" is in a small space that fits just that, a treadmill, a stairmaster, handheld weights and a bench. There is a water cooler and an air conditioner. Super basic. + Shelves by the doorway to throw your purchases, keys, etc. That came in handy. + Great library in the lobby area. Esconce yourself in a leather space and read up. + Great bed. + Nice reception and doormen. And the not so +'s: - It's in Financial District. Not know for nightlife. But it is close to the Fulton St station which may be convenient but its weekend schedule sometimes means you have to go to another further station to make it. - Walls seem thin. I heard guests traipse down the hallway and sometimes even my neighbor. I can filter a lot out but it was a little annoying. Overall great accomodations.

I'm a NYC resident who, after a catastrophe at my apartment, was pleasantly surprised by the warm service I received at Gild Hall. I booked online through Priceline so I was not expecting much when I arrived a little disheveled from my day. The young lady who checked me in was extremely pleasant and very empathetic when she asked as to the reason for my stay. I was given a room on the 11th floor, which was a smoking floor. I was a little hesitant when I stepped off the elevator as I did not want to get into a room that smelled of an ashtray. However, the room was spotless and did not smell one bit of smoke. The room was also very large by NYC standards. I believe I was put into a Deluxe King, so a slight upgrade. Due to my situation of not knowing when my apartment would be ready again, I resorted to booking an extra night a few days for a total of 4 nights. Since I did each through Priceline, I had to go down to the desk to do a quick check-in process each time, but every person I dealt with was exceptionally friendly. Housekeeping was also extremely efficient. I left the hotel late a couple days (I work from home) after a couple knocks on the door from housekeeping and expected to return later to find that my room had yet to be serviced, but was pleasantly surprised each time. I think I may have had to call down once, but it was clean within an hour of my request. The only qualm I had was that I use multiple devices to connect to the internet, and Gild Hall charges for WiFi access. However, after stating my confusion (or clutziness) for not reading the full script, the gentleman who checked me out the final day refunded the \"duplicate\" WiFi charges for each day, really going above what I expected. Overall, I enjoyed my \"forced vacation\" at Gild Hall. During an extremely stressful time, they allowed me a place to escape and relax.

Well think about the Fall when it's warm during the day and cool at night - since the hotel was still set up for A/C there was NO HEAT! And no way to get any heat. Shivering in the room... 2) Service is poor for a hotel of this standard.

We read in one of the reviews that the closest subway stop is closed, and we did see one Fulton St. entrance that is closed, but there are other entrances that are just a few blocks away from the hotel. - Rooms are very nicely appointed and elegant. Our view from the 16th floor still looked right into another apartment building, but it was fine. Bed was very comfortable, decor was nice, fair amount of space. We were concerned about the semi-transparent bathroom wall thing, but it was really a non-issue. You can't really see a thing. - Price was right!! We booked a superior king room for $215/night (on hotelbook.com) for Labor Day weekend. Where else can you find reasonable rates AND quality in NYC?? Cons: - Location is a little out of the way, and nothing nearby is open late, but if you've read the reviews and looked at a map, you should be expecting this. And on the plus side, it is much, much quieter than staying somewhere close to the sights. - The complimentary continental breakfast was a little pitiful. Sad selection and zero table service (couldn't find a napkin, glass of water, or server anywhere in sight). Skip!! - Housekeeping was a little sloppy. We had a couple towels that didn't look very clean, and the soap dish was dirty when we arrived. Not a big deal, but not up to the standard I would have expected, given the rest of the hotel. - Charging $10/day for the internet, esp in the business district, is lame. - No iron in the room - again, for a business district hotel, lame. A note on bedbugs: there are none here, at least as far as we could tell. I checked bedbugregistry.com before we went, and someone had written that they had seen bedbugs in their bathroom at this hotel. I was really worried about this and read tripadvisor reviews obsessively to see if anyone had commented on this, but no one had. When we checked in, my husband and I stripped the bed - checked the comforter, sheets, and mattress, and didn't see anything. We stayed two nights and have been home for a week and don't seem to have brought back any travelers with us. *Whew* I was VERY concerned about this. I told the front desk when we were checking out that I had read about a bedbug complaint online, and he said a few weeks ago, one guest did complain about bedbugs and that they sent up staff to check it out but didn't find anything (or did he say that there might have been bugs, but they were not bedbugs?). I recommended that the hotel dispute the complaint on bedbugregistry.com if it had been determined to be untrue, but he didn't seem too concerned. Anyway, I'm sure plenty of hotels deny any type of bedbug problem, so I appreciated that he was honest about someone reporting it. Just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone else is as paranoid as me! :) Overall, the next time we're in NYC, we would stay here again.

We stayed downtown because it was cheaper and quieter than other areas. The Battery Park area has/had all the things we loved: quiet, scenery, unique shops, and so much more. When we arrived at the Gild Hall Hotel, we were greeted with a warm welcome. An associate greeted us with immediate service. We wanted the valet parking service which meant he took our luggage out of the car, put it on a cart, directed us to the desk, took the luggage to our room, showed us the features of the room, brought us ice, and parked our car in a safe spot! All the same man! Not ten different people to tip, which gets very confusing. At the check-in desk we met Kelli Phillips. She was amazing! It was our fortieth wedding anniversary, and immediately she upgraded us to a beautiful suite! Our room had a living room with a huge leather sofa, two comfortable chairs, a glass top coffee table an HD LG TV that was fabulous. We also had a kitchenette with a coffee maker, sink, microwave and a small mini-bar fridge. We were able to store our personal items in this fridge. Our bedroom had a fabulous king-sized bed which had very comfortable sheets and pillows. It also had a very large HD LG TV. The bedroom was so comfortable! The bathroom had a huge shower, double sinks, many towels, and CO Bigelow hair and body products. It was awesome! Kelli seemed to be our contact person. I guess she must work 24/7.

It is not often that one comes across such well trained, genuine staff in the service industry. - Unique design/decor - Easy access to the subway, one block away. - Comfortable, clean beds. CONS: - Awkward to get to Javits. Taxi ride cost us $13-14 each way every day! Many taxi drivers claimed to not know this hotel and had difficulty finding it tucked away in the Business District. Often had to walk a block or two to find a main artery that taxis frequented as they do not pass by the hotel regularly. Only $6 to/from SoHo. - Not really a touristy hotel as most tourist sites are not within walking distance. - Small rooms and bathroom (no countertop space at all). - Aging finishing. Needs touch-ups on walls, furniture, doorways, etc. - Had to pay $10 for internet per day. In this day and age and in the Business District this should be included in the room cost. If you are primarily going to be located in the Business District, you can't go wrong for service at this hotel.

This is by far one of the best experiences with a hotel in New York. From the moment you are greeted by the door man you notice something different. The lobby is reminiscent of a cabin in Colorado. This is a very \"man's man\" hotel. Dark woods. Low lighting. Thick wood tables. Low level seating. Shelves of books. The nearby bar demands that you come and have a drink before hitting the streets of New York. The lobby and the attendants assisting you with check-in are not prissy. Yet, there is a great sense of customer service. Different from chain hotels, the employees even partake in being unique wearing trendy clothes that differs from stuffy, old concierge suits at other places. At night, the intimate lobby is filled with hip and young patrons conversing with each other enjoying the ambiance. There are no more than 10 rooms per floor. The rooms are decorated reminiscent of the lobby. Dark woods and rich browns. The headboard of the bed is the length of the wall upholstered in leather. The bathroom while somewhat small is clean bright and tiled in clear tiles. The brown marble floor gives it a clean elegance. The room has a huge brass chandelier that could be found in mountain ski lodge. I would not recommend this hotel if you are heading to New York City for the first time. It is located in the Financial District. It is less touristy then other parts of the city. Instead, if you are returning to New York and want to be amidst trendy residents who probably work in the skyscrapers of the surrounding banks. Or if you want to eat at small, contemporary restaurants with exceptional service and innovate menus catering to the discerning young professional. Then this place is for you. The area empties out after 5pm on a weekday. I believe that is a huge plus. The people that remain in the area are not tourists, instead its the residents.

This time, we picked Financial District, so Gild Hall (of the Thompson Hotel group) was the best choice for us. We were quite happy with the place, despite being a tiny bit worried about the mixed reviews. The decor is a unique mix of old-boy British club meets Zen simplicity. There were lots of quirky touches, such as a rhino footrest in the lobby, and antler chandeliers. Loads of cushy leather sofas to chill. If the names Wes Anderson and Vivian Westwood mean anything to you, you will appreciate the look and feel of this place. The room: A plaid throw on the bed (which has a huge leather headboard) contrasts nicely with clean undecorated walls. The dark blue industrial grade carpet in the room, however, was jarring against the sumptuous and simple details of the room. Having stayed in a number of NYC hotels, I have to say the room size was pretty generous. Toiletries were spare, but nice, from C.O. Bigelows. No shower cap, or other little extras, just lotion, shampoo, conditioner, bar soap. Oh, and no wi-fi, and they charge 10 clams for internet. Wah? The front desk and service were lovely, the bar was fun, and attracted what seemed like locals and regulars, mixing with out-of-towners. The restaurant Libertine was closed for summer, so I cannot comment on that. But there are tons of bars and restaurants nearby in every direction. Don't be misled by those who say there's nothing down in the Financial District. We found good pizza, old-skool diners, and more.

To be honest, in this location you have thousands of choice of places to eat, so eating in the hotel would be a silly idea anyway, go explore! The business centre was pretty useful, containing a few shared PC's and a networked HP printer (which I used to print directly to from my laptop). The rooms are fully equiped with LCD TV, minibar, bathrobes, wardrobe, and small desk. Other people have mentioned the rooms are a little small, I would agree if we were comparing against other outer city US hotels, but the rooms were pretty much the standard size you get in any European hotels and inner city hotels. A/C in the rooms was great and even with the lovely duck down covers (in summer!) I slept like a baby.

The bathroom was great, very clean and bright and a powerful over-bath shower and fully stocked with the usual hotel condiments. Other reviewers have complained about the transparent material used between the bathroom and the room, it is in fact shaded so you can't see through it at all apart from the odd shadow and wouldn't be a problem for people sharing a twin room. My only complaints were: - $10/day for wireless, at a top end hotel pitched towards business this was totally unacceptable, even smaller low-end hotels have free wifi these days. - Wardrobe space was OK, but no drawer space at all, for longer stays a few drawers to store clothes would have been required, with two people in the room we struggled.

The hotel staff were both friendly and attentive during our stay. Standard rooms are small-ish, but are very well laid out, with all the modern amenities you'd expect to find. The bed and bedding were excellent, soft and comfy. $10 per 24 hours for Internet access wasn't a big deal to us. Like all big cities, there's some street noise. For future improvements, I'd suggest that Gild Hall go for sound-proof windows overall, but once the bankers go home for the day, it wasn't really an issue. Speaking of location, this property is located in the Financial District, so there's not much going on after 5 p.m. If you expect to step out the door and be in the \"middle of it all\", probably not the right property for you. However, Gild Hall is only a two minute walk from a major subway hub (Fulton St.), where you can pick up the red 2/3 lines and green 4/5/6 lines, (meaning you can get ANYWHERE in New York from this point). We're subway friendly people, so this ended up being a real plus for us. The price for the room was excellent and the location, worked as well. One thing to consider! There's major roadwork being done in the entire district, so getting to the hotel by cab, was a challenge, since many streets were closed off. The entrance is on Platt St. and after we circled around in the cab a few times, we just got out and walked a 1/4 block to the hotel entrance. Not a big deal, just something to keep in mind. Overall?

The hotel has recently gone through a refurbishment and the whole place is fun, stylish, clean and comfortable. As everyone else has stated: The hotel is not easy for cab drivers to locate. I had the address, the Platt St. and Gold St. information and all cab drivers still had a tough time locating the hotel. Perhaps the Gild Hall website could include printable directions from airports and train stations in addition to the address. I think this would solve some of the problems we and others have had locating this fine hotel. We were able to store our luggage upon our early arrival. The doorman, concierge and front desk employees were professional and pleasant to deal with. We quickly got walking directions to the Brooklyn Bridge and after giving them a cell phone number to reach us when the room was ready, we enjoyed our day. The hotel is close to South Street Seaport, Wall St. and the Financial District. It's close to subway stations as well. (not too far from the Fulton St. station). The room was ready about 2:30. This is a really nice place. Good storage in the room, everything is new and I do appreciate the duvet cover rather than a bedspread. Room was a good size, again: very clean and stylish. (orchids is water glass 'vases', trendy glass bathroom tiles, muted shades of everything, thick wooden blinds, leather headboard, stocked mini bar and hangers that actually come off the rod and lovely toiletries and 2 robes). The glass door to the bathroom is so patterned (and the \"toilet side\" of the glass wall is frosted) that there was enough privacy for my husband and me. Might be uncomfortable, though, if you're not there with your partner. We enjoyed the lobby bar, (good selection of Champagne and vodka). The lobby is designed to invoke the atmosphere of a British men's club, but we thought it looked like an Argentinian men's club because of the hides on the floor. Anyway, it's fun without being silly. We didn't eat in the new Todd English restaurant in the hotel, but we should have. The Libertine serves 3 meals a day; we passed up their brunch offerings for a miserable experience at the Gold St. restaurant just down the street from the hotel. The concierge confirmed our dinner reservation, made suggestions for the next day's lunch and was available, attentive, approachable and professional. Doormen will get cabs for you (not just \"hail\" them, they actually go around the corner to secure a cab and ride it back to the hotel for guests.) Their sister hotel, 6 Columbus, stored our luggage on Sunday while we explored that part of the city.

After reading reviews on Tripadvisor and finding a good price on Expedia, we decided to book the Deluxe King room for approx. 150GBP. The location of the hotel was great. We were within walking distance of South Street Seaport, World Trade Centre site and importantly we were close to Fulton Street Subway. We did find it difficult to carry our luggage from the subway platform to the street level because we could only find exits via stars rather than a lift so it might be worth researching more to find out whether there is a more accessible way to get to street level if you require help. When we arrived at the hotel we were met by a friendly member of staff who checked us in pretty quickly. They took a copy of my passport and also my credit card information just in case we used any extras (i.e. mini-bar, movies etc). The receptionist informed us that we could use the business centre (actually a small narrow room with a few PC's in and a printer) free of charge as well as the fitness centres (also small narrow rooms with two cross trainers in and some weights). These also require your room key to get in. The en-suite room was very spacious and had a high ceiling. The decor looked very nice and the king size bed was extremely comfortable. There was an HDTV (approx 32\") on the wall which had quite a few channels in both English and Spanish including some HD channels which looked great! The room had a combination safe, a snacks draw and a mini-fridge full of alcohol, chocolate and soft drinks. There was also a robe available to use (we only had one robe, two would have been better) and also an umbrella, hairdryer and some magazines. For those who get embarrassed easily, please skip the next nine words - There was also a travel couples pleasure kit (Ooh!!!). Various freebies included some brownies to munch on, body lotion, soap, cotton wool, cottonwool ear pokey things which your not meant to poke in your ears (I'm a man, I don't know what they're called!) , shampoo + conditioner. The bathroom was clean and spotless but like a few people on here, it was a bit embarrassing using the toilet because one wall and the door was close to being see-through. It made the room look good having the design of the bathroom though and to be fair, you couldn't actually see what was going on but it still felt a bit awkward. Overall although our stay was just for one night, it was a really nice hotel and I can see why this hotel has been given a lot of positive reviews.

Things that could be improved on are; the see through bathroom door is truly see through and I as well as most people like some privacy in that room, the designer benches that flank the air conditioning unit are not comfortable and difficult to sit on for a small person (a nice chair or so would have worked for me), a microwave and mini fridge would have been nice too (not the mini bar fridge). Other than that it was an enjoyable stay. We always use a car service to and from the airport, but taxis seem more plentiful in front of the hotel than in past years which is a plus.

First, I thought, that the hotel had such a nice room decor, that their cheapo miniblinds just did not fit. In June we found our room with great cloth miniblinds, which were much better. Second, I also had concerns, if the A/C would be sufficient in the hot summer months - It was! Third, the last time the delicous breakfast pastries served every morning in the lobby were pretty much gone at around 9:00AM and not replenished. This time there were plenty and we even were able to get some very late one day, when we arrive downstairs at 11:15AM and usually they are only served until 11:00AM.

We were warmly greeted by the staff but noted a lot of construction still in the area of the lobby, and we saw some workers about the place and in the elevators in and out. The room we got was very clean and decorated in a modern/minimalist style. The hallways were brightly painted and had many vintage photos for wall art (at least on our floor). We didn't have much of a view - but we didn't stay in our room except to sleep. What we liked about the hotel was that it wasn't tremendously busy, even for a Friday night, and with the exception of another guest who came in loudly at 2 AM and couldn't seem to determine which room was theirs (complete with a 2 AM phone call to our room!!!) we heard no other guest, street or construction noise. The beds were exceptionally comfortable!! Yes, the A/C was a little bit noisy, but the room was sufficiently kept cool which is what's most important. The only real complaint we had, which we brought to the mgt.'s attention, is that the shower fixture in our room had been installed in such a way so that no matter how we turned the knob, at best only lukewarm water came out. I like my showers hot so this was unacceptable to me - and this was true even while very hot water was coming out of the sink faucet. The hotel does offer a light continental breakfast in the lobby, but if that doesn't suit you, there is a diner on Pearl Street not far from the hotel, as well as other coffee/donut shops in the general vicinity.

Their reviews were the reason I decided to give Gild Hall a try---maybe my expectations were set to high. So here goes--- The room was gorgeous, well appointed and utilized for the space provided. Great tall ceilings and nice new furnishings. REALLY nice bathroom with great water pressure. If you ignore the realiy, REALLY noisy AC unit and the very strong \"Fabreeze\"-like smell when you entered (I guess there could be worse smells in your hotel room), the room was really great. What I don't understand is all of the great kudos to the staff of Gild Hall. Yes---they always greeted you and smiled and were polite. Yes--- they occasionally made small talk and yes they were very pleasant. They also smiled when they told me that I did not have a reservation, only to find when presented with a confirmation number, that they entered my first name as my last and my last name as my first. They blamed this on Quickbook, yet every written communication from Quickbookon this reservation had my names in the right sequence. They also smiled as they told you that your room was not ready even though you were not an early arrival, and they didn't bother to see if another similar room might be available. They smile as they hand you a key for a room on the 6th floor (out of 18) when you asked for a room on a high floor...both on your reservation record and verbally in person. After waiting an unusually long time for the single elevator, the baggage guy with the baggage cart that takes up 3/4 of the single elevator greets with a sincere smile and \"hello\" as he tries to maneuver the cart to be able to \"squeeze you in\". And while I understand their frustration, the guests from all of the higher floors get very perterbed when the elevator reaches the sixth floor and you barge in no matter how much room there is because you are not going to wait for it \"again\"! The \"continental breakfast\" is coffee w/o any kind of lower fat milk alternative and a tray of mini-croussants. If you need something a little more continental, there is a great gourmet deli just a few steps up the block on William Street that has a wonderful selection of fresh pastries, fruit, juice, breads and everything else most places offer as a \"contenental breakfast\". Now---in fairness---if you're standard is Intercontinental where they also smile, but it is because they take pleasure in frustrating you and love to say \"sure can't\", or Marriott, where they just don't notice you at all-- then Gild Hall has very good service. But for those of you who think this was great service, you should check out ANY Kimpton property---70 Park Ave. or The Muse in NY -- and THEN you will experience outstanding service. OK---Kimpton has spoiled me -- but the way I think about it, if Kimpton can do it, why can't everyone else? Don't get me wrong---Gild Hall is a nice place and given the price I paid via Quickbook, it was a really good deal. I'd possibly even stay there again at that price---but don't go for more than $200-$250 for this place---you'll be able to do better. The service is \"pleasant\"---but not necessarily \"good\".
