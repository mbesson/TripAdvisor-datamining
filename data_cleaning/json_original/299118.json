By any standard, the room of the hotel is one of the biggest I have seen in Hong Kong and it is spacious. Check in was a breeze considering they have several counters for that. On the whole, the hotel gave me a feeling done it has been around for some time but this is not an issue because in Hong Kong, one hardly stays in the room!! The location is superb as you are practically in the midst of action with less than 2 minutes to the MTR station and also short walking distance to Habour City. Due to the size of the room, somehow I have a very comforting feeling which is mainly because most rooms in hotel is extremely compact, and this hotel room is huge. Another first for me is to have breakfast in hotels in Hong Kong Due to the choices of food in Hong Kong, I have never chose a package inclusive of breakfast but this time round, the room came with breakfast so I must say the experience is new as well.

The lobby is large and welcoming but the room we had on the 15th floor was tired and very very small. It did however suit us for the 2 nights. Status was recognised but there was no upgrade, no breakfast and no Internet until we asked, at which point Internet access was given. I remain \u00a0firmly of the view that wi if Internet access today \u00a0should be included in all hotel rates. It is now an essential requirements rather than some luxury add on. The following morning we went to have breakfast however the buffet would have set us back over $110 USD for 4 and the was not going to happen. My kids eat little and there is no kids eat free policy here. The room was basic but provided all the usual needs. The was some complimentary water however any subsequent water had to be paid for. The staff I met were efficient but not friendly, very Hong Kong in my view. The is a small pool on the roof which was great but could be open longer. Overall nothing outstanding and nothing to make you want to return. Given the influx from the mainland i suspect tha occupancy rates will remain high resulting in falling service standards and ever increasing room rates.

The upgrade also gives access to the Executive Club throughout the day for coffee and cakes and drinks and good selection of food from 6pm each evening. The only problem I noticed with that this year was the number of children now in the club. Their handling of the food without supervision of adults left a lot to be desired and sometimes meant you wouldn't eat the food after the children had handled it inappropriately with their fingers or coughed and sneezed all over it. I would suggest the club is adults only. Haris bar was good but sometimes the overstressed waitress got a little bossy with customers and you could wait a very long time for service.

I was allowed a late check - out from the hotel that evening but because of the rush of the 15th year celebrations at the Victoria Harbour every road to Tsim sha tsui and the MTR Station was blocked. I had an International flight to catch and had to rush to the airport, the hotel staff was not at all helpful they feigned ignorance abiut the transport available and did not even direct me anywhere or helped me get any taxi or to the underground train. I had to walk to the Sheraton Hotel (which is about 500 mts away) tagging all my luggage where the helpful staff directed me to take the Airport Express and helped me buy a ticket. One of their staff helped me to find my way to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station in the mad rush and after changing 4 lines (mistaking I took one wrong train) I was at the airport in time for my flight.

In the bars also be aware of friendly local women paying you great interest, they are \"ladies of the night\", and they also work the hotel bars including the holiday inn. The breakfast in the hotel is never boring, they rotate the selection every morning, between three menus so there's a selection if you stay there a long period. The staff is friendly beyond belief, they show you to your room, look after you, present you with business cards and will check up on your stay. They cannot do enough for you and do their best to make your stay the best they can. Finally as I said, the rooms are tired and in need of a refurbishment, no matter where you stay in the hotel they are all similar, so an \"upgrade\" doesn't mean a great deal. That said they are comfortable, the air-conditioning is good in the hot weather and they are quiet.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location,\u201d", "Author": "Ggwestcoastfin", "ReviewID": "UR134562885", "Content": "Hotel is located in a safe area.

The HIGM is located right on the very busy & vibrant Nathan Road (Tsim Tsa Tsui shopping belt) of Kowloon. We disembarked the Macau-HK ferry at the China-HK City ferry terminal and unwisely decided to walk from there along Canton Road then Peking Road to the HIGM instead of catching a taxi. It turned out to be quite an unpleasant walk. Lugging our luggage and weaving through crowded streets in the late spring HK hot and humid weather. It took us about 20-25 minutes. Tip: If you have luggage with you in HK always take a taxi which is very affordable. Even if you think it\u2019s only a short distance. Check-In We arrived at the HIGM feeling hot and sweaty around 2:00pm, its designated check-in time. Hence the reception desk is very busy with other guests also checking in. It was about ten minutes wait before we were attended to by a smiling reception person (Ms Denis). By then I was unreasonably agitated and unjustifiably complained about the \u201clong\u201d wait. To her great credit she continued her pleasant disposition with us and had me calmed down very quickly. Her skill in pacifying a difficult guest (ie myself) is indeed excellent. The HIGM is most fortunate to have person like her on their staff. She is certainly well suited to be in hospitality work. I take this opportunity to apologise to her for my unwarranted rudeness. The Room There is no view to speak of from our Deluxe King room on the 5th floor. Look out the window and we were \u201cvoyeuring\u201d into the apartments of the building across the narrow street. But that was more than compensated by the space afforded in room and its bathroom. It\u2019s a rarity for a standard hotel room by HK/Kowloon standard. There is even space for a workspace and desk. We felt it was very comfortable. We slept well on the bed and pillows. Haris Bar Located on the 1st or 2nd floor, it\u2019s a pleasant place to have a drink or two in. Average price for a drink is HK$80-100. Happy hour is round about 6:00pm to 8:30pm. It has a \u201cL\u201d shape layout with the bar counter and live music performance stage at the \u201cshort side\u201d. When we were there (abt 9:00pm on a weekday night) it was quiet with not many guests. There was live music performance on. We were served by a female staff. She was quite unwelcoming in her manner. Her response to my order for a lime juice margarita was a curt \u201cwe only have lemon juice\u201d. Either she is having a bad night or she is one of those person unsuited to hospitality work but do so at the guests expense. We only stayed for 10mins without finishing my lemon juice margarita. \uf04c Dining There are 3 (or 4?) restaurants which we did not dine at with the abundance of dining places just within walking distance of the HIGM. So can\u2019t really comment on them. Housekeeping Fine work done by the HIGM housekeeping team. Coming back from shopping after a couple of hours and the bed was already made and the room cleaned/tidied. Pool Not even sure they have one, but think there is. No comment. Shopping The HIGM is located toward the south end of Kowloon\u2019s Nathan Road smack in the midst of Tsim Tsa Tsui shopping belt. So there are no shortage shops and malls nearby and withi walking. The Harbour City mall (one of if not the largest in HK/Kowloon) is only abou 10-15 mins walk and two streets away. The K101 and iSquare and malls are both just 5mins walk away. So if the sole intent for your holiday in HK is to shop till drop, then the HIGM is certainly a very convenient hotel to be staying it. When your arms are already filled with shopping bags you can simply go drop them off in the room, rest the feet a bit and be out shopping again. HK famous Temple Street (for the street shopping addicts) is only about 20-30mins walk away (north along busy Nathan Road then turn right into Jordan Road). And of course there are more shops along the way. So the 20-30mins walk could well turn into 2-3hours. So be warned. Overall Experience It\u2019s a great 4star hotel with very affordable and good value rate Spaciously comfortable room. Friendly, very competent and engaging staffs (except for the one I was served by at its Haris Bar). Note: the staffs whom I had contact with during my stay: reception, bellhop, concierge, security/guest relation, housekeeping, bar waiting. Good location for the serious shopper and the hungry dining enthusiast (for both signature/street restaurant foods) The Holiday Inn Golden Mile, Kowloon shall be on my 4star hotel choice list whenever I next visit HK (I\u2019ve already booked my flight there for mid Nov 2012 \uf04a). And I would recommend the HIGM to any visitor to HK without hesitation.

Smooth checkin. Lobby: Pretty big. Good ambience. Entry from front side as well as from the market side. The doorman and the staff at the lobby are very courteous and polite. They can guide you for anything you are looking for and call taxis for you. Room: Good rooms, though a bit small. Coffee maker, complimentary mineral water available in the room. Soft as well as hard pillows available - 4 per bed. Breakfast: wow...wonderful spread...a welcome change from the monotonous breakfast of Hotel hollywood in Disney HK. The breakfast is simply superb!! Very courteous and polite staff. Lunch: Had buffet lunch at the restaurant on 1st floor and it was wonderful . Lots of choice and a relaxed atmosphere. They have a separate section for Japanese food..with sushi and other stuff. Just check it out. Though the food is good in the restaurants inside the hotel, there are so many dining options at walking distance from the hotel. just explore them!! Bar: there is bar on the M floor. I went there during the afternoon for a cup of coffee and found the staff there to be un-attentive and slightly rude in their behavior. It was a surprise to me as all the other staff of the hotel had a very different attitude. Room Service: very efficient and fast. Laundry: is pretty expensive if you get it done in the hotel. There is a laundry shop just 2 block away from the hotel - GENERAL LAUNDRY. Come to the main road from the front side of the lobby and take a right turn on MODY road. Walk straight, leave the first right turn. turn right on the second turn. walk for 50 - 70 mtrs and turn left on the first turn. you will find this laundry shop there. Convenience store: 7Eleven is just across the street. Travel desk: there is a travel desk in the lobby but it belongs to some travel agency and not the hotel. Though the tours offered by them are expensive but they are safe and reliable. The staff at the lobby, door man, bell boy, front desk staff - all are very cooperative and willing to provide guidance on traveling and other things. Talk to them and explore. Guided tours are a waste of money and you do not get to see what actually you want to. Shopping: Oh, lots and lots of shops in and atoned Holiday Inn. Low end to really high end shops available. Roam around and check out. One thing that might not suit people traveling with family - lots of freelancers women moving around the streets near the hotel and also inside the hotel. I saw many of them in the lobby and the bar on M floor. Security guys do not seem to be bother about them. All in all, a wonderful hotel at a wonderful location!!!

We had booked a double room online and were greeted with the option to upgrade for $200HKD per night - which seems to be a standard when reading other reviews - to a family room (1 king & 1 queen) agreed to this as it suited us better travelling with children. When we were asked to sign for the extra charge it was $100HKD more per night than quoted so we questioned it and the receptionist explained that the cheaper price she quoted was only to get a refurbished double room. We disputed this and asked to speak to management but they were 'unavailable'. We asked if she had made a mistake but she didn't seem to understand our English at this stage, she then showed us to the room which she led us to believe was the family room and showed us the refurbished double room, We asked to go back to reception and speak to the Manager as we would like the family room - her reply was that \"in the time we had been arguing the family room was booked and there were none left\". Returning to reception we asked when the next family room would be available but never got an answer to our question, and decided to give up as we just wanted to get to our room. One of the Loyalty Managers then came over to see what our fuss was about and proceeded to try and charge us the extra charge for the '3rd person' in our room, we disputed this as it was on the original booking form that there were 2ad/2ch. After nearly half an hour of grief, he gave up and said that we could have the family room (that must have miraculously appeared on the booking screen)! This left us with a bitter taste in our mouth although the rooms were well appointed, bathrooms on the small side, housekeeping were efficient and friendly. We never ate in any of the restaurants as there was hundreds within walking distance to experience.

The bad includes one of the worst reception experiences ever, we arrived early and were given a temporary room, great, dump our stuff wait for luggage that doesn't appear so decide to leave the key with reception who will move all our luggage into the temporary room then into the new room when ready. We left for the day and returned at 6pm to find that only one room was ready, if fact they only gave us one room we had to remind them that we had two booked. So we are told to all go to the new room and wait for the other room to become ready. Ok, so we get to the room to find no luggage, so we ask for our luggage to be sent to the room that is ready, but they don't really know where the luggage is, we explain that the luggage should be in the temporary room (but suspect that it is still in the carpark) and wait 30mins to get our luggage delivered to our new room. Other room is still not ready so we let them know that we will be back after dinner to collect the key, eventually our room is ready. When we check out we ask if we can get late check out on one of the rooms, this is not possible...I explain that we had to wait an extended time to check in and would appreciate a late check out, but no. We can leave our bags in their secure baggage area, but they don't have a locked luggage room, in fact their luggage area is in the car park and is anything but secure (I know this because when waiting for my luggage I went to my bag in the car park to change shoes and no one questioned me opening my bag...). The clincher was when I went to check out they charged me for the first night on each room which I had already paid as a deposit, perhaps this is standard practice assuming people don't check their credit card bills or invoices. So in a nutshell I was one very unhappy customer. The good (I am the eternal optimist) great location really close to the MTR, the Italian restaurant is excellent, with great service but quite expensive. The buffet breakfast is acceptable. Okay so my advice if you have the patience of a saint and don't mind paying twice for your room then this is the hotel for you, otherwise stay away, there are hundreds of hotels in HK that will offer more for less (not less for more like the holiday inn).", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunedin, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat location above MTR station in heart of Tsim Sha Tsui\u201d", "Author": "blowenz", "ReviewID": "UR128254787", "Content": "You stay here for the location.

We love the location of this hotel (situated in the busy Nathan Road shopping district in Tsimshatsui - close to the Ocean Ferry Terminal & shopping, markets and MTR stations). Last year we had stayed in a triple room with our 2 young children, which was comfortable and represented excellent value for money. And their buffet breakfast was one of the best we had experienced. Unfortunately, at check-in we were advised that all the triple family rooms were occupied, and hence we chose to pay the upgrade to a suite, with the hotel kindly offering to provide a rollaway bed and additional linen for the sofa free of charge. As far as space was concerned, this turned out to be a good option (we were travelling with a huge amount of luggage having just returned from a family ski trip) - we had a large living area, separate bedroom, ensuite bathroom and additional powder room. The layout worked very well, the bathrooms were lovely and spacious and we had a great view of busy Nathan Road from our living room. However, in comparison to the recently refurbished triple rooms, unfortunately the suite was in desperate need of updating, and a good airing! Unfortunately, the air conditioning had to be turned off when we were in the room due to the overwhelming smell of mould (I later realised it was the cause of my 3 day headache). I would have loved to have aired the room myself, but the windows were fixed closed. Despite new carpets being laid in the hallway and other guest rooms on the floor, our suite still had the old worn and musty carpet, the replacement of which would have made such a difference to the aesthetic & comfort appeal of this room. Such a shame - for the significant extra paid per night, I really did expect a better quality room - if it weren't for the fact we had just made a 14 hour flight, had 10 pieces of luggage and 2 sleepy kids on the rollaway and couch, I would have requested a room change at check-in. However, there is no doubt that this hotel is in a fabulous location, does a great buffet breakfast, has a lovely pool area, great masseuse, and offers excellent value for money particularly for its standard rooms (my parents have stayed in two very comfortable refurbished rooms in the last couple of years which did not smell of mould!).

The brightest example of this was the check-out. Guess how long it took? Oh, very quick for their standards ...just one hour!!! We did not yet take any things out of the room and came to reception to close the bills in advence. So we asked receptionist to return the 3200 USD cash deposit left as deposit during chek-in in order that we exchange it for HKD right next building from the hotel (5 minutes required) and could pay with exchanged HKD for the room(we refused to pay in USD and hotel's exchange rate is quite predatory). Remember - we did NOT take out ANY of the things out of the rooms. Receptionist returns the cash BUT requires right then the equal deposit from our credit card to be blocked!! Damn! what for, we ask??We are going for the next building and without any of our suitcaces!!!! Receptionist scratches his empty head and goes to seek advice from manager. The advice is pretty damn nice - \"we can not let you out on your own(i.e. we do not trust you) - we would send the security guy with you\". Not for our security!!! Just in order that we do not dissappear from the Hotel! And no, they do not care about Priority Club status of the Guests.

The street markets are a bit of a hike although but taxi\u2019s are relatively cheap. Easy to get to from the airport, take the Airport express train to Kowloon. Tickets cost about HK$100 return and you can buy them at a few spots in the airport but if you want to use AMEX buy them at the round kiosk at the platform. Then up one level at Kowloon station and catch the free \"K3\" shuttle bus and you will be the first one dropped at the hotel door.

To eat I suggest you turn right outside the hotel and along Mody Rd then right into Chatham Rd, then left on Salisbury Road. On your left are a string of restaurants and pubs with views to Central Island. Back to the hotel.

For a family of four persons, we found it faster and more economical to take a cab from Lantau Island rather than lug our luggage on the subway. Traffic was fairly light until we encountered some congestion closer to Tsim Sha Tsui. Hotel reception was very polite and slightly apologetic for not having our rooms ready. However, we did not mind waiting as we had arrived about an hour ahead of the official check-in time. Hotel was very full and much as we preferred rooms on the higher floors, ours was on the second floor. Naturally, there wasn't much of a view from the rooms, but this was more a consequence of the other rather aged buildings around the hotel. Rooms were very clean, the beds were lovely and I liked not only the spaciousness (each had a sofa in it) but also the renovated look. The bathrooms were well lit and had a fantastic shower but no tub. Other reviewers have also highlighted that the hotel is located in a fantastic location and I have to agree. It was no problem finding food (available in most directions away from the hotel) or transport (buses and subway). Shopping (Sogo Mall) and attractions (museums, Avenue of the Stars, and the magnificent harbour) were easily accessible via the underpass. There was even a church 5 mins walk away where we were able to attend Sunday mass. One odd issue we noticed was that both our rooms were freezing. While the outside weather was very chilly and may contributed to this, turning the aircon fan speed to low and the thermostat to 26 deg Celsius didn't help at all. Eventually, we had to turn the aircon off for the entire time. The other issue was that we found the lobby scent rather overpowering - I couldn't help myself wanting to walk away from the area as quickly as I could whenever we had to pass through.

I agree with what other reviewers have said about this hotel. It is well placed for various shopping malls selling luxury European goods in fashion, cosmetics and Swiss watches.

I skipped eating breakfast and just had a coffee or a tea in my room, with some fruit, or bun bought in a supermarket the day before. The hotel charges for wi-fi, but across the road in the i-square mall you can get it for free, there is also a Starbucks open until midnight. You can also get free internet at the airport and around the ferry terminal and maybe elsewhere, but it is a bit patchy. What makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the quality of the staff who are incredibly helpful and courteous. Whatever the problem, or question that I presented them with, they had an answer and solution. I had a problem with the door lock not opening, a member of the front desk team came up to look at it straight away and immediately called an engineer to fix it, which was done within a few minutes. In between I was invited to go to the bar and have a complimentary drink. Now that is service. There is a discrete security presence on the main entrances and inside the lobby. I am not sure why, but certainly on each corner walking along Nathan St, I was repeatedly asked if I wanted clothes made up by a local tailor, or to buy fake watches and while they are not aggressive, they are a constant pain. One treat I enjoyed was getting the South China Morning Post in a little black bag placed on the external door handle every morning about 7.30.

Breakfasts were varied in the restaurant, and our kids enjoyed the use of the automatic pancake machine - you press a button and it does it all for you. One night there was a special fireworks display in the city and we went to the roof to get a better sight. The area closes at 8 or 9 pm (can't remember specifically) and we asked if we could stay on for the special event. No way, completely, utterly inflexible - it closes at the usual time. We were disappointed that they were so lacking in consideration for guests for a one-off event. Anyway...

We also used the outdoor, rooftop pool, and it was clean and a comfortable temp. No laundry facilities on site - we prefer to have a hotel laundry room with tokens so we can choose to do our own washing. Location was excellent and the underground train only took about 7 mins to get to the Central station side of the Harbour. It was fairly easy to figure out where to go when catching the train, even though we can only speak English. Staff were very helpful. Make sure you have your inclusions in writing before you go - we checked several times that our two children (18 & 14) would be included in the complimentary Exec Lounge & they told us they were - there was a problem with that when we arrived and they wanted to charge us more, but it was sorted out by helpful staff.

The mall opposite provides an extensive array of reasonably priced upmarket places to eat, with a lovely bakery to pick up treats to take back to the hotel and a nice gourmet supermarket in the basement with wine and beer at good prices. A 7/11 also provides a place to pickup little bits and pieces for kids to snack on as well as water bottles and beer.

The first day, first room included a view of a curtain blocking a building covered with blue tarp and $6 mini bar. The first day, second room included a view of the street and a view of the 7 Eleven open 24 hours! Early departure last day in Hong Kong I expressed a desire for a quiet room.

The last day, second room included a view of the curtain blocking a building covered with blue tarp and quiet.

The reason for the choice was, we were 4 members (2 child of 7 years) and knowing that hotel rooms in Hong Kong is small, we had to make choice of hotel depending upon the size of the room and the bed. However, we were extremely happy with both. Rooms (double deluxe) was quite spacious. Beds were large enough for 2adults. cleanliness was high, service was good too. There were only 2 things which I did not like - the outside view was terrible, however i was aware of the same. I had insisted on higher floor, but still it did not make any difference. However, since it was family trip, we were out of hotel by 10am and was back only by 10pm and did not feel the view issue to be of any disturbance. However, if you are planning a leisure stay, you may not enjoy the hotel as view is not as good. Second thing which i did not like was - the Mody road entrance had a lot of seedy people after 8pm, mostly call girls, pimps were seen outside the 7eleven store on Mody Road, which made things slightly odd especially when you are with your family. Location wise the hotel was fantastic and C1 exit of Tsim Sha Shui MTR was right infront of the hotel's Nathan Road entry and thus made our travel quite comfortable. especially at the end of the day, stepping out of MTR to enter your hotel was the ideal thing to happen. Also, Star Ferry Pier, Symphony of Light, was 5 minutes walk from the hotel.

The MTR station is barely 2 min away. The boat ferry to Hong Kong is less than a 10 minute walk.. There is shopping galore. The vegetarian Indian \"Woodlands\" restaurant was barely a 5 minute walk.

MTR Stations (HKG's super efficent subway system) are conviently located on either side of the hotel and some of the best shopping and dining can be found both in and around the hotel. The hotel has excellent Chinese, Italian, Western Deli and one of the best if not THE BEST coffee shops in all of Kowloon. The breakfast and lunch buffets are superior in both quality and variety thus you are assured of a very satisfying dining experience every time. The hotel's newly renovated rooms are top class. Beds, pillows sheets so comfortable. Bathrooms spotlessly clean with full flow showers, 1st class toilet amenites and clean towels renewed daily. Your choice of newspapers, hi speed internet (for a small fee). Prompt room service, roof top pool, a fully equipt gym. Friendly and efficient staff from reception to housekeeping to check out. Yes, the Holiday Inn Golden Mile has it all. After 100+ visits to HKG my wife children and I can honestly say we have golden memories on the \"Golden Mile\" thanks to the Holiday Inn.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington", "Title": "\u201cGood location but getting a bit tired now\u201d", "Author": "Ikychar", "ReviewID": "UR113295392", "Content": "This hotel is in a perfect location for experiencing Hong Kong in all its copy watch and tailor made suit glory.

Over 8 weeks before arrival in Hong Kong we booked a club room at a seniors rate at this hotel. On arrival all paperwork was ready for us, and we were given keys to Room 1622, one floor below the club level and adjacent to the lift well, as incidentally is 1620 and probably all rooms ending in 20 or 22. Our room was acceptable in terms of size and facilities, but it was only during the night with the regular noise of the lift/elevator all through it that we realised we had, what is in hotel speak \" a non preferred\" room. As we had only one more night to go we made no complaint about it, and suffered the same disturbances throughout the second night. On check out in the club I asked who pre-assigned rooms and was told that room allocation was made at the time of reservation by the reservation department. So 8 weeks earlier as a Priority Club Member of 8 years I was allocated a bad room \u2013 not a great display of reciprocal loyalty The conclusion is obvious, if you book online with Holiday Inn at a low rate as we did, a seniors rate, then you will be allocated the worst room in the house rather than the best, and that even if your are a club member that loyalty has absolutely no value. The attitude of this hotel has to be questioned too. It suggests many things few of them complimentary. At the same opportunity I emailed both IHG Asia Pacific Customer Relations on the web and the Hotel GM direct. The former responded in 24 hours with apologies with a request I inform them of the problem. They responded to my complaint promptly thereafter with thanks for telling us of the problem and effusive apologies that as a Priority Club Member I was one of our most valued customers and that they hoped I would stay at IHG properties again. Unfortunately they made no attempt to answer my main question about room allocations. They assured me that the matter would be on record etc etc. From the Hotel 3 days passed before a Duty Manager responded to my email originally addressed personally to the Hotel GM Mr Kirk and which asked them if they were interested to know I had a complaint. I sent the MOD an email with details of the complaint namely \u2013 why 8 weeks before my visit had I as a Priority Club Member been allocated a non preferredand noisy room \u2013 3 more days passed and I received a standard computer generated email thanking me for my stay which I returned to the same MOD and asked if that was their reply to my complaint. 1 more day passed and I received an email from a Mr Timothy Chua who suggested that I had not been given a quiet room because: a - I had not asked for one on the internet booking form. b \u2013 The hotel was full at the time. I replied to Mr Chua that the latter suggestion was untrue as I had checked the room availability to see if the rates had changed downwards the week before arrival and as for his first suggestion, I asked if they had a mix of noisy and non noisy rooms for people to specify. I also suggested again that the reason for the poor room had all to do with revenue. Mr Chua responded to these points by stating that A: all our rooms in our hotel are at its best condition and there is not a single room that is slightly better than the other relative to the same room category That statement is a nonsense, and also contradicts his suggestion that I ought to have asked for a quiet room, Why would anyone waste time doing so \u2013 all rooms in each category are now the same according to him. B: our staff allocated the best possible room based on the king size and non smoking room you previously requested. That statement too is incorrect, for had it been the case the hotel would have been full and not have been able to accept a reservation for another room in the same category in another location one week before my arrival. So when all I wanted was an explanation of the allocation and perhaps an apology, all I got from the Hotel was tardiness and obfuscation. From The IHG customer service, they clearly had no influence on the hotel and felt unable to address my question on the Hotel\u2019s behalf, and offered effusive apologies for the event. Just as a comparison of attitude, when I checked in at the Regency Club in Xian a day later, an upgrade to a suite was provided, despite the online booking being at their best available internet rate and even though I had not stayed at a Hyatt Hotel for 8 years. In that period IHG had had the lion\u2019s share of my business. Caveat Emptor with Holiday Inn Golden Mile.

I've been to its restaurants many times and they were good; and I've had excellent experiences at other IHG properties in HK, and they were good. So, I decided to try Holiday Inn Golden Mile, as I have some business on the Kowloon side this time. And I was disappointed. 1. check-in. when I approached the check-in desk. There were 3 people behind the counter \"doing things\", and NONE of them offered to serve me. I stood there waiting for 5 mins before one guy reluctantly looked up to waive me over. Once I was at the counter, he was very efficient; but that goes for everyone in super-efficient Hong Kong. 2. then, I was told that I had to pay HK$170+ per day to use the Internet. In almost ALL IHG hotels that I have stayed at throughout the world, this is the FIRST time I was told that I had to pay for Internet. I told her that I'm a Platinum member and if I could use it for free (like some other hotels that charges Internet), and she politely said no. This is ridiculous. Internet is an essential part of everyday life; you might as well started metering water and electricity and ask the guests to pay for those! I was extremely disappointed. I could've stayed at Holiday Inn Causeway Bay and Crowne Plaza Causeway Bay, at similar rates, and use Internet for free and save me an equivalent of roughly 10% of the room rate. 3 & 4. The following two points are perhaps minor points, but it shows the consistent [lack of] service attitudes of the staff. 3. In most branded hotels, when a hotel staff is waiting for the elevator/lift with a guest, the hotel staff normally allows the guests to enter first, as courtesy. In Holiday Inn Golden Mile, I was waiting for a lift with a hotel staff. When the lift door opens, he walked in first. Ok, it is not the end of the world, but it really shows the service attitude of the staff in this particular hotel. Even in the worst 3 stars hotels in the middle of USA, staff will allow guests to enter first. It's just courtesy, they are your customers and your guests. 4. Another thing I noticed is that when I walk past the cleaning staff in the corridor to my room, they do NOT greet me. This does not happen in other IHG hotels in Hong Kong. And again, it shows the service attitude of the staff is consistent ... consistently lacking ... from check-in to entering lifts to cleaning staff and to the management who decided to charge for Internet even for Platinum members. 5. The building is old, the rooms are tired. The bathroom is horrible. It is like stepping into a motel built in the 70s. It is clean, but it is very tiny, dated, and hence very uncomfortable. Unless it drops its rates to at least 30% BELOW that charged by Holiday Inn Express Causeway Bay, I would NOT choose to stay at this hotel again. Given the services, the Internet, and the dated and tiny bathroom (Holiday Inn Express Causeway Bay's bathroom is modern, spacious, and comfortable); the correct and fair price point for this hotel should be 30% below Holiday Inn Express Causeway Bay.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coolum Beach, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and worth the upgrade\u201d", "Author": "qldkid", "ReviewID": "UR103406203", "Content": "The location of this hotel really suited our needs for visiting Hong Kong Island, Macau, Shenzhen and Kowloon as well.

However, she was quick to recognise the Platinum card I was holding and immediately informed her fellow colleague to assist us. Eunice promptly did a fast and efficient check-in and upgraded my room to the newly renovated premium room. She was so detailed in the check-in procedures that I need not ask a single question. Everything was clear and well-informed. Our room on the 6th floor is clean and spacious. Most of the amenities we need are provided. The noise level from the streets and roads can be rather disturbing but I guess it's pretty much the same in the other hotels. Everything went well throughout our 3nights stay. The only complain I have is the rude intrusion we encountered on the last day. The housekeeping lady opened our hotel door at quarter past 12 in the afternoon, without knocking or pressing on the door bell, despite that I have already pre-informed my check-out time at 2pm during the check-in with Eunice. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel to my friends for its location and excellent service. Special thanks to Eunice who check-in for us and Timothy who attended to our check-out.

Overall a good hotel although we will definitely not be staying there again. The hotel is located in what is best described as the Indian quarter of Kowloon. As soon as you step out of the hotel you notice numerous men positioned every 5-10 metres soliciting people to buy \u201cFake Rolex, fake watches, tailor\u201d etc. This is very annoying especially after 5 days of saying \u2013 \u201cNo, thanks\u201d. On several instances we were also offered \u201cHashish, marijuana\u201d \u2013 we felt like turning around and saying \u201cP.ss off mate!\u201d, instead we just walked away. Also, along Mody Road (the hotel is on the corner of Nathan Rd and Mody Rd) after dark there are Indian prostitutes dressed in the traditional gowns soliciting sex from mainly Indian male tourists. While other posts have said that there is mould on every floor \u2013 this is not correct. Basically floors 3-6 have not been renovated and the floors have a strong odour of mould in the corridor as well as the rooms. We stayed on the sixth floor on the first night and couldn\u2019t handle the scent. The next day we advised front reception. While Mario at reception initially responded like he didn\u2019t know what we were talking (they probably are told to respond this way) they did allow us to move to a renovated floor with no questions asked. The renovated floors have new carpets, paint etc and are excellent overall. So if you get a room on floors 3-6, politely ask to be moved and the friendly staff should oblige. Another tip \u2013 ask for a room facing Mody Rd (even numbered rooms) and not the other side as these look directly into an old and filthy apartment block with rubbish thrown out of the windows and left in piles to rot. Overall, the Holiday Inn is a good hotel that is reasonably priced, with friendly staff and good facilities. It is one of the few hotels that allows four guests in a room which is handy as we were travelling with our two children both of whom are under 5.

English speaking TV channels. Mini bar & in-room safe also. Charge for internet was HKD120 for 24 hours - worked well.

I was traveling with 10 other people from my company, and we were all staying at the Holiday Inn Golden Mile for one week. The lobby was clean and heavily perfumed, and was unfortunately the nicest part of the hotel. We were all assigned different floors, and upon exiting the elevator we were all horrified at the condition of the hotel. The carpets from the elevator and all the way down each hall were stained with large black mildew and mold stains. A heavy musty smell hung in the air, to the point I found myself wanting to hold my breath. I got to my room, and it wasn't any better. The carpets were, I think, red at one point in my room. Now they were a dirty brown. I didn't want to take my shoes off or walk barefooted across the carpet. The vent in my room had black stuff (mold, dirt, or dust... disgusting regardless) coming out of it. This was the same story with everyone in my party. We complained to management, who offered to shift some rooms around. We looked at other rooms, but they too were all the same. There was just no escaping the mold and mildew. Unfortunately our rooms were pre-paid, and the hotel was not willing to refund our money, so we had to end up staying. The first night, I woke up with major sinus pressure and congestion. Other members of my party started to have similar issues the next day. Fortunately we weren't spending the day in the hotel, and my issues cleared up shortly after exiting the building. We had to get air purifiers and medication in order to stay there the whole week. If that weren't bad enough, the second night there I opened my curtains to the horrible view of a Hostel and sweat shop. While fuming at the conditions, I stared at the trash strewn dump next to me (for a picture, go here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisdotson/4406880951/). Thinking to myself, \"It can't get any worse,\" I was immediately proven wrong. Right there, in full view of ANYONE looking out of the hotel, was a grown man masturbating right in front of his window. His curtains were wide open and anyone looking out that side of the Holiday Inn could see. Suffice it to say I would NEVER recommend anyone stay here. Management tried to blame the mildew on the close proximity to the sea, but one of our party stayed at The W, closer to the water, and there was absolutely no problems like this at that hotel.

Room - It was quite a walk down the hall to get to the room and the first thing I found out was that my key card was not working. Great. Walk back down and get it fixed. The room is good sized, especially for a hotel in central Tsim Sha Tsui. You can tell the bed is new and some of the furnishings are new. However, the overall impression of the room is that it is still a bit outdated. It's probably time to renovate the entire property and not just buy some new furniture. The bathroom is small and feels restricted. This is odd considering the overall size of the room. On the positive side, there are plenty of amenities such as razor, toothbrush, lotion, etc. My room had a connecting door, which was poorly designed because I could hear everything going on next door, such as the loud television and phone conversations. Food - I had their daily breakfast and lunch buffets at the Bistro on the Mile restaurant. It was very impressive, since it had a wide range of food choices, such as Western, Chinese, and other Asian specialties. There is truly something for everyone. Even more impressive was their dessert selection. I lost count of how many choices there were. Service was outstanding and it was definitely worth the money spent. I visited their bar a few times and it was ok. The prices are steep and the service was a bit slow. The bar/lounge does seem to attract the \"working\" crowd, especially later at night. Awkward to say the least. Location - The hotel is located right in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon, on Nathan Road. This is a great spot to get around the area. Most places are only within 5-10 minutes walking distance. The Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station entrance is right across the street and from there you can get to anywhere in Hong Kong.

I stayed in a large room with 2 colleagues and all of us starting sneezing as soon as we entered the room. It didn't take long to work out why. The room was COVERED in dust and looked as if it had not been cleaned properly for months. The bath had soap scum marks all around and dark black marks on bottom. We were staying for 7 nights on business and every morning someone would knock on our door and try and enter to \"clean\" the room before 9am. Considering nothing really happens in HK before 11am, this was ridiculous and very frustrating. In addition to this, one of our party got sick for one day and we put out a do not disturb sign when we left them there in the morning. This meant nothing. The phone apparently rang continuously with housekeeping staff asking if they could come and clean the room. Random people also kept knocking on the door and ringing the bell to try and come in. Not sure what these housekeepers actually did as they don't change the sheets every day unless they are told to (in contrast to every other hotel that asks you to put the card on the bed if you DONT want linen changed, this one won't change the sheets unless you put the card on the bed), they definitely don't vaccum or dust and certainly don't clean the bath during your stay. Downstairs, the lobby bar is literally filled with smoke from the moment it opens to the time it closes, so don't even bother unless you're a smoker. The reception staff were excedingly rude - and no, it isn't because of cultural differences; I travel very frequently in Asia and have come to know what is the norm...the frontline staff here are for some reason just rude and very unhelpful (example: on checkout, our billing was interrupted for over 15 mins while the person serving us decided to serve a different customer who wanted access to his safe deposit box...there were other counter staff available to help, but they preferred to stand around chatting while one staff member did all the work). Also be warned that directly outside this hotel is a notorious drug dealing and prostitute pickup point on Mody Road. You'll also be harrassed by the \"copy watches, copy handbags, suit, ladies suit\" crew every single time you step outside the hotel door on Nathan Road. This hotel also charges an absolute fortune to use the internet. It was so pricey we were forced to buy a card from 711 and head to Starbucks across the road to do what we needed to do. Given how much they charge for the room it is absolutely outrageous to expect guests to fork out another small fortune to access the internet. It's a real disadvantage when you're on business as you need to work in the evenings and early mornings in more than 5 min email blocks like leisure travellars. The only thing good about this hotel is the fitness centre which has a better shower than what you have in your room. Hardly anyone ever uses the steam/sauna/bathroom area so if you want a bit more space to move, head to Floor 19 to shower etc...even if you don't use the gym room (which is very good with a good selection of cardio and weight options).

The hotel has changed quite a bit... For the better! The biggest difference is that the restaurant has had a complete makeover. The buffet breakfast is as good (actually better) than it used to be, but the decor is much brighter now. The staff there is very friendly, and there's lots of western and local food to start your day off right. Another big change from five years ago is the availability of in-room high speed Internet. At $160 HKD per day it's not cheap, but is at least on par with what other chains around the world charge for similar services. If you'd prefer your internet for free The Kowloon Hotel across the street includes it in their daily rate (at least they used to), but be prepared for a much smaller room -- I stayed there back in 2003 as well... I had assumed that all rooms at The Golden Mile faced either the Mirador Mansions to the north, or the Chungking Mansions to the south; I was pleasantly surprised that mine, at the back end of the hotel, actually had a bit of a view (see accompanying photo). The room itself was very spacious, but a locked door to the adjoining suite meant that I could often hear my neighbours. I stayed over New Year's Eve and got a souvenir velvet bag filled with cookies -- a nice touch. The hotel is easily accessible via a complimentary shuttle van from Kowloon Station, and it's back entrance spills out onto the famous Nathan Road. If you can stand the touts trying to sell you a suit or fake Rolex (or avoid them) I highly recommend the Golden Mile as a mid-tier hotel.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Island", "Title": "\u201cLocation Location Location\u201d", "Author": "Kiwi_On_The_Move", "ReviewID": "UR23272475", "Content": "When we first arrived in Hong Kong we were meet with our shuttle to take us to the Holiday Inn Golden Mile, it was 7.30am when we arrived in the Hotel it was humid but lovely I recommend Shorts and a T-Shirt when travelling to Hong Kong.

They offer two complimentary water bottles in the bathroom (no need to buy one at the mini-bar) and complimentary shoe shine (look for the shoe bag in the closet). There was also a bathrobe and disposable slippers in the closet. The bathroom was very nice. They have a weighing scale, toothbrushes with mini toothpaste and the usual shampoo, lotion, shower gel, comb, razor and shaving cream. The only flaw that I can think of is that the hair dryer was a little dated and didn't have much power. Extra info: The people outside the hotel trying to sell 'copy watch', 'tailor-suit', 'copy purse' didn't bother us. They might be annoying but they're also trying to make a living.

Complimentary Airport Express shuttle plies between Kowloon station every 12 minutes; Exit G of TST MTR station is right in front of the hotel; Star Ferry terminal and Harbour City shopping centre are within walking distance. In terms of F&B options, we only tried the chinese restaurant - food was so-so but prices are steep. I would recommend the one at the Cultural centre which is not far away. Good cantonese food at reasonable prices - plus good harbour view. As for the flip side, indeed the hotel is situated among many rundown buildings so the view from the windows are not exciting. But having said that, I reckon that most would find such from other hotels as well, unless one stays at the pricy ones along Salisbury Road. Afterall this is part of the everchanging HK cityscape - newer developments surrounded by older buildings. For those who are affected, one could request for a room facing Mody Road and nearer to the Nathan Road end. As for the touts, yes there were many promoting restaurants and massage services.

We took a piece of fruit from the buffet, and they encouraged our children to take something from the bakery. We ordered room service one night about 10.15pm. Took approx 10 mins.

We did the usual at check-in then was asked if I wanted to be upgraded to the new refurbished floor at $200HKD per night per room (I had 2 rooms booked for 2 nights) to which I declined since I was only passing through on my way home.

The room was so smelly like you would smell at a gym with body massage oil and the carpet was absolutely filthy with long term stains. The view was a shocker but that didn't really concern me. I called down to reception to speak to the girl who checked me in but she was busy so I was told she would call me back. 20 minutes later no call so I called again & was put straight on to her as the girl who picked up the phone obviously didn't want to deal with me. I complained about the condition of the room also stating the website did not state that the room was going to be filthy and smelly. I was upgraded to the refurbished floor free of charge although my other room stayed because it was acceptable. This room that was initally offered to me at $200HKD extra per night is the same size only higher up, newer & clean - what you would normally expect from a 4 star hotel. I again asked for a late check out to which I was told no even if I paid, as they were getting in a group & they are full house. Fair enough.

Booked a king bed room and upon arrival, was upgraded to their newer renovated executive king bed room. Room was definitely a lot bigger than the Sheraton's, as was the bed. Location ideal, being right next to the MTR (metro/train) station. With the 3 day MTR tickets for HK$70 as part of the Airport Express train package, used the train for just about every thing, including to Disneyland. View - overlooking a rather delapidated building that doubles as a sweat shop. Breakfast buffet had a good selection. Pool - not heated and outdoors. Way too cold for this time of year to use. Room service - housekeeping slow to answer calls, but once request made, service is very efficient. Recommend it ahead of the Sheraton for price.

There is a free shuttle bus service which runs continuously from Kowloon stattion (MRT) to the hotel & back. We never waited more than 10 mins. for the bus. Staff at the front desk are very courteous, helpful, and friendly. The same goes for housekeeping. Rooms are small, but comfortable. Beds are excellent, bathrooms very clean.

Its right across the street from the MTR subway station which gets you anywhere in Hong Kong. Is also a short walk to the ferries which get you to Hong Kong Island (Star Ferry) , Macau, Lantau, etc.. There is unlimited shopping along Nathan Road just steps away from the hotel. Lots of good food options too. The hotel room itself was just fine, nothing special or fancy. The room size was actually quite large compared to the other hotel we stayed at which had almost no floor space at all. The hotel is surrounded by other large buildings so it doesn\u2019t appear to have rooms with views. Our view was straight into an old dirty apartment building so our curtains remained closed. The Gym is very nice with lots of modern equipment and the rooftop pool also looked OK. The staff of the hotel was friendly and professional. If you look like a tourist, you will be hounded by people outside the hotel to buy fake Rolex watches and custom tailored suits. This location seems to be ground zero for that stuff where as we didn\u2019t see any of it on the HK Island side.

At this point we had no choice or we were going to have to try and stay somewhere else. Of course, we took it and the room was very clean, and it was extremely nice. Service was good, I thought the room service food was a bit expensive. I would recommend this hotel for single travelers but not families.
