The hotel is centrally located in Berlin Mitte with lots of trendy shops around and many sights within walking distance. However, even for business reasons it is located conveniently in a calm side street with good subway / fasttrain connections. The hotel itself is very stylish, the rooms are spacious and have large modern bathrooms attached which are only separated by a curtain. No worries - shower and toilet are closed off by doors. The style of the rooms is also modern and a bit on the \"no frills\" side. But there is nothing one would really miss. A big plus is the lounge on the top floor which offers quite a nice view over the city and offers free drinks and snacks 24/7. This is really great if you arrive late at night and just want to grab a bite before sleeping. The staff is friendly and helpful, too. All in all there is really no reason to go anywhere else when you are in Berlin especially since the prices are very reasonable.

There is food available all the time, with swanky smoothies and greek salads in glass jars...very green of them, and very appreciated. You can eat it upstairs or bring it to your room. They also have a bar set up where it is a trust system- you fill out a little form then take the kind of wine or other libation you desire. (there is a charge for that, but not for the food). This all means that there isn't a refrigerator in the room, which was fine with me. I have terrible allergies and the staff went to great lengths to look up the ingredients of the many breads they had available, printed it out and translated it all for me.

As a result, there is no fresh air to be found anywhere. Perhaps I am more fussy than most because I have a (very low level of) asthma, but our room was stale and we dreaded having to return to it at the end of the day. There was absolutely nothing we could do about it - there were no windows anywhere that we could open to get fresh air. As we were on a New Year break, all hotels were fully booked and we had no chance of moving to another hotel, We had to either leave the entire city or suffer four nights in a stale room. Such a shame - otherwise this hotel was one of the nicest I have been to.

We would definitely stay again. This hotel is a great relaxing base. It is definitely not a hotel to luxuriate in - no spa, no marble clad lobby, no bellboys, no little gift on arrival - but then if you want that stay in the 5* Adlon! Instead it is a lovely hotel to lounge in between forays out into Berlin. It is staffed by friendly people, the rooms are good, the breakfasts are good, and the little extra's here and there makes the stay feel a bit more special. Nothing is perfect, and neither is this hotel - a few things could be better, but in no way did they make our stay any less comfortable or enjoyable. Good things: 1. The location. Right next to a U-bahn stop. Right in the centre of a nice shopping district, near bars. A short walk to most places. 2. Big beds. The rooms are really dark at night, which is great if you are a light sleeper. 3. Natural light bathrooms and showers looking across the city (don't worry no one can see you naked). 4. The lounge on the 7th floor. It is the highlight - free food, drinks, coffee at any point. No checking room numbers, no hassle, any time you want. It made a real difference to be able to pop up for a good quality (and free) coffee and slice of cake and read the papers when we came in or just before we were heading out. 5. The staff, who are all friendly, fluent English speakers, and really helpful. They lent me sticky tape to wrap a gift, told me the weather report every morning, booked restaurant tables for us... Not so good things: 1. Breakfast is so relaxed that it is hard to know what to do. There is cold breakfast stuff laid out for you to grab but you can also order hot food from the staff milling around or direct from the chef, but no one told us that. It is a small thing but had a member of staff told us right at the start we could order what we wanted we wouldn't have spent the first day feeling confused and envious of other guests ('Look, they've got eggs! How do I get eggs?'). 2. This sounds like a really odd petty thing but neglecting a really obvious thing makes be a bit annoyed. Camper slippers are provided in the rooms (which is a lovely idea) but it doesn't take a genius to work out that when a gay male couple are staying a room maybe you should give them two larger pairs rather than one large and one small (in pink!) they usually provide. It wasn't intentional, but its those sorts of little observations that mean you, as a guest, don't have to think or ask about something, that makes a great hotel amazing. 3. There isn't a pool.

I think there's only like 38 or 40 rooms). Lighting in the rooms is perfect.

From the minimalistic decor to the 24-hour cantina where everything (except alcohol) is free, you will be talking about this hotel well after your trip is over. The staff is super-helpful, and can offer great recommendations for shopping, entertainemnt and restaurants -- all within walking distance. As an example of the uber-friendly service, we had a 6 am cab to the airport for our journey home, and the front desk staff made lunch-bag breakfasts which were waiting for us on check out. The location is fabulous, with Museum Island a short walk away, several U-bahn stations nearby, and fun shops, restaurants and bars in the immediate surrounding area. The only downside about the hotel was limited ventillation in the bathroom, which made the room stuffy. Also, I was in Berlin on business, and there was no desk in the room at which to sit and work. The \"business center\" was two Mac computers and a printer off the dining area. However, the wifi is fast (and free), so I was able to get my presentations done, and luckily I had no faxing or copying to do. We had a great time, and we're looking forward to our next visit.

Most impressive are the rooms, they are all superb in their standard and working operation and we both truly felt comfortable. Our favourite part of the hotel had to be the 7th floor food and chill lounge that we spend a lot of time in, the ambience created is lovely (when not being destroyed by noisy Americans) and they go to all efforts to service your needs. The staff in the hotel are superbly polite and efficient, frankly it was a wonder to see how no job was too big or small, and certainly no hassle - every request met with a smile. It's worth checking out the SPA on the ground floor too which my wife and I almost had to ourselves every night - perhaps due to some nationalities in the hotel being 'aware' (or perhaps unaware) of German sauna etiquette. The Bad? Well there is a little but perhaps only highlighted by the rest of the hotel and service being exemplary. The main problem we had was a smell of sewage when exiting the lift on our floor for a couple of nights, it was obvious they knew about this because the windows in the hallway were suddenly open (and closed when fixed), but we would have appreciated a more formal acknowledgement; fortunately the smell hardly penetrated the room door. Lastly we would strongly suggest they educate (perhaps on their hotel info) guests about the sauna etiquette as although we had a fair idea we weren't clear if being a westernised hotel they might have imposed some 'Westernised' elements (e.g. allowed swimsuits); thankfully they had not and I would urge them *not* to water down the German sauna experience.

We arrived early and our room was ready, which was a big bonus, the receptionist was really helpful, pointing out areas that might interest us nearby.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and a mix of what you get when you visit Brighton and Amsterdam. Very close to all the main attractions too. 24 hr snacks and drinks - being able to indulge in fresh smoothies, drinks, coffees, freshly prepared sandwiches, salads, cakes, bread etc ... at all times of the day and night really helped ensure we didn't spent a total fortune refuling after walking all over Berlin! Staff - always very friendly and helpful, suggesting great restaurants and places to drink. Quiet - even although the hotel was quite busy it was nice and quiet. There wasn't any noise from the road outside and we didn't hear anything from our neighbours room.

Fantastic, state of the art equipment but, as it's in the basement, there were no windows to open and no obvious air con controls so it got very, very, very hot very, very, very quickly. I asked a member of staff - think she may have been a cleaner - who popped into the room if there were controls for the air con and she couldn't find them.

It would have been great to relax by the pool as the temperatures reached 30 degrees or at least, say, had a spot on the roof to enjoy a view in the open air.

Everything was clean and modern. All of the staff were friendly. The location is very good. It's a short walk to the Museum Island and a lot of other sites of interest as well. On top of that, the hotel is actually right on top of a U-bahn station. The station entrance is no more than 20 meters from the hotel door. The line (U8) doesn't take you anywhere interesting really but it's easy to change lines at Alexanderplatz. In-room Wi-Fi was perfect. There are two Macs and a printer to use on the top floor. The best and most distinguishing feature of this hotel is the Tentiempie: the top floor restaurant area with great views. Breakfast is very good and served until 11am on weekdays, until 2pm on weekends. To top it off you can go there for snacks anytime you want by yourself - or just take something away to your room. There are croissants, fresh fruit, crisps, coffee and tea, a fridge full of sodas, juices and bottled water etc. etc. - all for free. The top floor area also has a self-service bar that works on the honor system. So you could mix yourself a drink, just how you like it.

I really can't say anything bad about this hotel. It is worth the money if you can afford it! Locationwise - it's ridiculous how easy it is to get there. Don't even bother with a taxi!

So I will not repeat any territory I covered in my first review but focus only on 2nd time impression and the additional element of having a child along while staying at this hotel. Overall I really enjoyed my stay here again and found the service to be of a very high level and extremely consistent among the staff, particularly down at the reception where the people there were pretty much flawless. Having notified the hotel in advance that we would have a toddler along with us, they correctly provided the sleeping cot we had requested. Better yet, they also placed in the room a small bathtub and some baby wipes etc, which was very helpful. We were impressed by that. On this second visit, I think I would say that the hotel could and should improve the airflow in the rooms, particularly as one cannot open the windows at all. - When you first enter the room, the fan is on low setting it the room smells slightly musty which spoils the first impression. This goes away once you set the fan on high, but still, a first impression counts and it makes you question things. - The room air can be stuffy if you dont keep the fan speed up at the \"high setting\". Even then, it doesnt create superb air conditions but just barely beyond ok. I'm sure this has to do with the environmental aspect of the way they seem to want to operate the hotel, but in my opinion this hotel seems to focus on making the guest comfortable and air quality is a big factor there Anyway overall I wouldnt want to harp too much on that one complaint, but just wanted to detail exactly what I meant by it. We tried to make an appointment at the famous restaurant downstairs in the first floor of the hotel, but were not able to. They were closed on Mondays and on other night that they were open apparently they offer only a fixed menu that takes a couple of hours and would not accommodate anyone wanting a quicker or shorter meal. Strange, but so it was. Fortunately this area of Mitte has no shortage of restaurants and we enjoyed eating at a couple of them. I will do separate reviews on those. Also this time around at Casa Camper, I really felt the value of this location just slightly away from the really heavy duty road traffic in on Torstrasee and the road near Alexanderplatz. That makes for a really nice settiing for a family type of visit. Relatively calm and a lot of very cute streets and shops nearby. There is a small park with simple playground near Auguststrasse that was was convenient for taking a child out to play a bit, climb some slides sit on the swing etc. My daughter also really enjoyed a visit to \"Milchhalle\" near the same park for milkshake afterwards. So a good second visit at this hotel and surprisingly comfortable with a small child in tow.We really had a nice time here and I rate it just as high in performance as I did the first time", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Veroia Greece", "Title": "\u201cnot bad choice\u201d", "Author": "ThanosVeroia", "ReviewID": "UR64200083", "Content": "on the return of Krakow,i had a stop in Berlin for business affairs. we stayed for two nights,the hotel is clean,enough professional style.the rooms not so spacious but it was not a problem.generally had everything you need for e decent stay but not something more.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marseille", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel that fits you like your favourite shoe...\u201d", "Author": "Mike_Marseille", "ReviewID": "UR59108188", "Content": "You know the tired Hotel cliche about being 'a home away from home' - and they never are -- well this one is!
