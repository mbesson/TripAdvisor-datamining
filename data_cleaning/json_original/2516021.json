Very nicely designed in a contemporary, expensive way. We stayed in suite which was huge and lovely. It's the nicest Ritz Carlton we have stayed at. The lobby and public spaces are a dissapointment though. This hotel is conveniently linked via a passageway to the Marriott but they also rely on that a lot- meaning no business center in the ritz, you have to use the Marriott. Also, this hotel had the best burger from room service we ever had. My husband is a connoisseur of room service burgers and even I was impressed. Also, their bed was the most comfortable ever. Very quiet suite. The only downside was the sliding doors on bathrooms. This is a design trend we see everywhere now and they are particularly bad in this hotel. There is a huge gap even when the door is closed so you have no real privacy in the bathroom. You can hear everything and if you walking by, you can see into it too.

The rooms were so beautiful and elegant but still so cozy and warm. So spacious for a city hotel. The bathrooms were also huge with very modern touches. This hotel even had a doggy menu for their furry guests. The only negative about this hotel is the size of the lobby which isn't much of a negative. We did transfer to the ritz from the jw which is actually the same building but with different check in lobbies. The transition was smooth and they were very accommodating. The valet was great as well very patient and gracious we were able to transfer the valet information with changing from jw to the ritz without a problem or having to take out the car and check it in again under the new room ourselves which was great and a time saver. The bathrooms were unique in that the shower and bath tub were in the same area (you'll have to look at the pics to get a better understanding) It might have been a handicap room so i'm not sure if that was the reason or if they were going for a european thing. Anyways it was still pretty cool. The closet was located in the entry way and thats where the safe was as well as your essential for ironing and laundry bags. Another great touch was the espresso machine, instead of a regular coffee maker, which i LOVED. They had plenty of beverages to choose from the snack bar. They also provide complimentary waters, which they also hand to you at the valet (they come in handy on hot days) This was a really beautiful hotel with wonderful amenities!

Based on this hotel, however, I would have to say that Ritz-Carlton has dropped, not one but several notches down that scale. I give it three stars because \"poor\" is an unfair rating. The hotel is new- just two years old, I was told - and very clean. They're marketing it as a \"boutique\" hotel, which to me is another way of saying they charge luxury rates for a cosmetically souped-up Hilton Garden Inn. I had reserved a Deluxe King room with my Platinum Amex, which guarantees an upgrade if available. No upgrade was offered at check-in so I asked and was immediately offered an Executive King room, but it seemed like an oversight that they didn't offer it automatically. The room required an elevator transfer, which underscored the somewhat wonky layout of this hotel. When I walked in the door to my room, I was truly (and not happily) surprised. The first thing I saw was a hideously cheap-looking light fixture:a prison-cell bulb suspended in a metal cylinder so rickity that it rattles continuously back and forth from the draft created by room's circulating air fan. The \"drapes\" are cafe rod curtains so flimsy that no matter how hard you try they cannot be drawn completely closed. They've basically used a minimalist Asian-inspired design motif as an excuse to cut every imaginable corner. I usually call Housekeeping to request turndown before I leave my hotel room for dinner, just to be sure the job gets done. There was no Housekeeping phone extension provided,so I just hoped for the best. Bad plan; no turndown service occurred. Is it possible that it's not even offered here? Trying to be fair, so a few redeeming features: the bathroom was ample and nicely designed. Soaking tub and walk-in shower share a nicely-designed enclosed space. Very nice and well-designed make-up mirror, and yes, to some of us, that matters. Complimentary Internet, which tells me they are trying to be relevant. And each staff member I encountered was truly genial and eager to please. They try, and almost succeed, to make up in service what this facility lacks in other areas. I was awakened at 6 am by a blaring alarm clock apparently set by some previous guest which was kind of a final straw/camel'sbackbreaker. This property shares a building with the Marriott and something tells me that I would find a better value there if I were to return.

With the exception of the club floor conciereges the hotel is not up to Ritz Carlton standards. The staff is not polished, cohesive or detail oriented and I would rate this hotel on par with a Marriott at best (probably not even a JW). Cold and uninterested in the guest is probably the best way to sum up two visits. Again, the Club Lounge was the exception. Rooms are \"ok\". Beds extremely comfortable and terriric. A lot of design glitches, particularly in bathroom. For example, although the \"wet room\" is a great concept, the shower cannot be turned on without being covered from cold water from the rain shower head above while waiting for hot water (which is just luke warm at best). Also, the bathroom sinks will splash your clothing even when turned on low. We had 2 rooms under 2 separate names booked. When our friends arrived at the hotel they walked into our room with the bellman and were actually assigned to our room even though we had already checked in and advised we were waiting for our friends! They were told my wife and I had not checked in when we had 1/2 hour prior with the same desk clerk and advised we were waiting for people. Not the end of the world, but just one example of lack of attention to simple details where this pseudo Ritz Carlton misses the mark. I would stay at this hotel again due to convenience to downtown venues and it is the best hotel in the area. However, I would advise management to polish the game quite a bit to be worthy of being part of the Ritz Carlton family and meeting the expectation and mark that Ritz Carlton guests have come to expcect.

This is a very classy hotel, nice large rooms and a fantastic spa. I had the deep tissue massage and Jeana did a very thorough job. The \"sanctuary\" and facilities in the spa were very appealing. The tea, ML, is extraordinary. I know that sounds silly, but it's true! There was an Herbal Life convention, so the hotel was full and the lobbies abounded with people from around the world. The pool deck offers a gorgeous view of the city. It's on the 25th floor. The Wolfgang Puck lounge is on the 24th floor. The location is right next to the Staples Center and across the street there's a Regal movie theater. We went to a play on the other end of town, but this Ritz has a town car that will drop you off or pick you up around the city from 8-11 a.m. and 5-8 p.m. We took a taxi back after the play. You can walk out the Ritz door and into a plaza with lots of restaurants. You can walk a few blocks to other restaurants. To get to \"China Town\" and \"Little Tokyo\" you can take a bus, taxi. Roy's Hawaian Restaurant is only aproximately 4 blocks away, maybe it's 5. Funny, but I noticed the same thing about the bathroom sink someone else mentioned in a review. The bathroom is beautiful -- but water does fly out of the sink so watch your clothes. As for the person who reviewed and was irritated that his room wasn't ready at 10 a.m., doesn't everyone know that a normal check-in time for a hotel is 3:00 p.m. in the U.S.? So personally, I think that guy is arrogant for expecting that. We actually did get an early check in, but around 2:00 p.m. We spend one afternoon at the pool and ordered the food on the phone.

There are two chairs, a concierge desk and the two person check-in desk. There was no champagne or pampered atmosphere as stated in other reviews. I was greeted by a front desk person who explained that my room was not ready, which I understood, as I was there at 10:00 am, however he was not at all accommodating. He asked for my method of payment, even though he was not checking me in (strange), and seemed inconvenienced when I asked to have my bags checked. I asked at that time if it was possible to get a pass to the concierge lounge, he corrected me by saying \"We don't have a concierge lounge at the Ritz - we do however have a Club Room which you can be upgraded to when you check in\". I found this to be very condescending and arrogant. It may be that I was dressed in workout gear as I was in town for a Fitness Convention, and that may have not fit in with the \"LA Ritz\" requirements. I often stay at 5-star hotels, and have never been treated so poorly. At that time, I asked that they call me when a room was available and left my phone number. He stated that they would put a rush on the room for me, which made me feel a little better. After checking my bags, I realized that I left my convention badge in my backpack, so I want back 5 minutes later and asked if they could grab my backpack so that I could get my badge out. The front desk person informed me that I would have to wait for the bellman to come up to the front to get it. When he checked my bag, the bellman did not check it, the front desk person did, and I assisted him with bringing it to the room directly behind the desk. There was no one in the lobby, so I asked if he could just grab my one small backpack, and he begrudgingly completed the task, which took less than 30-seconds. I thanked him and remedied him to let me know as soon as a room was available. I waited for a call to confirm my room was ready for 5 hours, and never received a call. So much for rushing the room for me. Either way, when I checked in, I was greeted by a more pleasant front desk person, who apologized for not calling me when my room was ready and proceeded to check me in. Again, he asked for my method of payment, and I informed him that I had already provided it. He apologized and said that it was not put into the system and that he had to take it again, making me wonder why the first person needed it. Check in went well (still no champagne), and I went to my room. The room was very well appointed, modern and clean. It was a fantastic room overlooking the swimming pool. This is what I was expecting from the Ritz! I have no complaints about the room at all. The walk-in shower, the amazingly comfortable bed, etc. all were up to 5-start standards! My group of 7 had dinner that night at Wolfgang Puck's 24, in the Hotel, which was amazing. The food was delicious, the service was impeccable and the view was beautiful. We secured a very private table, and enjoyed an amazing dinning experience. Upon getting ready to check-out, I called down to ask if transport was available to the hotel, and informed them that I needed a car for 6. They said no problem, just come down to the concierge and she will take care of it. When I came down, the concierge told me that it would be 45 minutes to get a limo. I told her that I would just call the Limo that I took in from the Airport as it was only $110 and they said they could pick me up with less than 30-minutes notice. She then told me that they had an Escalade available immediately and that it could easily take 6. I wound up waiting for 20 minutes for the Escalade, which did work fine for our group. When the driver dropped me off at the airport, I gave him my card to charge the ride on, and he stated that it was billed to my room. I asked if he knew what the rate was and he stated that he did not. To my surprise, I found that they charged my room $190 for the ride. $80 more than the limo I was going to get. I have no problem paying the expected amount for service, but I felt that this was very deceptive and the price should have been stated in advance, especially when I told her the rate we paid coming in.

The attention to detail was exactly what one expects from a 5-star hotel. From the glass of champagne at check-in, I was pampered and treated with the utmost care. I stayed on Floor #23, which was the Club Floor. The Club Room offers up sumptuous edibles all day, from a breakfast which included eggs and bacon, fruit, and every muffin and bakery item imaginable, to a lite supper which included meats, fish and poultry, as well as sides and salads. And don't pass up the fabulous selection of cookies and meringues on your way out the main Club entrance! Whenever I entered the Club Room, I was personally greeted, sometimes by name. I enjoyed taking most of my meals there, as well as popping in to grab a diet Coke or water, or to use one of the two computers located in an alcove. My room was not spacious, but the amenities made up for that. It included a 42\" flat screen TV, ipod docking station, and other stereo components which I did not use; high-speed internet is offered for a fee. There were the obligatory self-serve mini-bar and refrigerator, as well as complimentary water, and coffee/espresso. The bathrooms were lovely, with walk-in shower, huge tub, and a TV screen built in to the mirror. The king-size bed and linens were exactly what one would expect at this hotel - luxurious, satiny and soooo comfortable. The only thing the room lacked was a larger closet; it accomodated my needs, as I was traveling solo. But it would have been cramped for two people. I spent Saturday morning at the 2nd floor spa, where I received the same personal greeting and attention to detail. I scheduled a lovely facial from Daniella, and a manicure/pedicure from Lillybeth, who was so funny and gracious. The spa is dressed all in white, with private rooms for each service offered. I left feeling really pampered! The lay-out of the Ritz-Carlton LA is a little different from most 5-star hotels. To start, it shares a high-rise with the Los Angeles Marriott, which takes up the first 20 or so floors. The hotel portion of the Ritz is on floors (approximately) 22-26, with the Ritz Carlton condominiums in the floors above that. Of course, you use high-speed elevators which take you directly to the Ritz-Carlton rooms from the small lobby. From the lobby you can walk through a corridor to the Marriott, which boasts a HUGE lobby area with an array of restaurants and bars. The entire Ritz/Marriott building is located directly across from Staples Stadium, the LA Convention Center, and the Nokia theatre. One other nice amenity is that the hotel has a Club Car for use by its patrons, free of charge. It will take you anywhere within a (I think) 5-mile radius of the hotel, first-come first-served. The resident restaurant for the hotel is WP24 (a Wolfgang Puck offering), which serves Asian-inspired cuisine. Additionally, there are restaurants of every offering and for every budget within walking distance of the hotel. There is also a 14-theater cinema complex directly across the street. My reason for staying at the Ritz was because I was attending 3 concerts in downtown LA (I'm a musician and Gustavo Dudamel enthusiast!). The Ritz location was perfect for my needs, and the ambiance was just right for a woman traveling solo.

They garanteed us that workers won't be working next two days since it's weekend. They were offering their executive suite room for the price of reguler room if we wanted to move again, as well as first night they lower the rate 20% off and second night free. Despite their fault to have a restaurant right above guest rooms withourt carpet with horrible noise way into 2 AM, manager was really accomodating. Pne other irritating fact, their bathroom sink faucet is designed too high so when you use the sink water do splash all over your clothes and all over the sink so you have to wipe off the sink after you use it. This is brand new hotel, designers who design this hotel should check and make sure that everything works well before they choose the most good looking fauset from the showroom. They should not have guest rooms right under WP24 restaurants. Front desk staff told me that this has been their problem.

Kinks are to be expected from any business - I think since that time, their front line staff must have gotten a hang of their roles. I found the service was great and what you would normally expect from a 5 star hotel. One thing that previous guests have discussed before that cannot changed is the layout of the property. It is connected to the JW Marriot which is sprawling in comparison. Their lobby is grand and filled with attendants. In fact, my taxi dropped my off at JW's lobby, I guess they think the two properties are synonymous with each other? If you do get dropped off at the JW, you will need to walk through a tiny little hallway on the left hand side to get to the Ritz. The lobby there is very small in comparison but cozy. You can already see from all the other travellers photos the decor - Very new, modern and top notch - is true to life, so I won't comment on it. I will have to say that the washrooms are EXCELLENT. The washroom is split in 2 so It has a separate toilet and bath area - perfect for couples who need room to each do their own thing :) The shower area features a rain shower and SUPER CLEAN tub. There are rarely any hotels that have tubs clean enough for a bath for my standards but this has got to be one of them so that says a lot about the cleanliness of this property. It's right next to the Nokia and Staples Centre. Immediately downstairs you will find many mid-price eateries to grab a bite. Most are your typical bar-food. They also offer an In-House DRIVER and towncar which will take you out within the local area - but no returns back to the hotel. They don't take reservations but you can simply call the front desk and ask if the car is available and they will let you know when is a good time to go down to the lobby to wait for the drivers return.

We were able to get a decent rate using the Ritz's Reconnect package. Note rates here and at the adjacent JW Marriott are highly dependent upon events scheduled at the nearby Staples Center, Nokia Theatre, and LA Convention Center. Our stay, for instance, was sandwiched between the Primetime Emmy Awards and the MTV Video Awards shows at the Nokia. Our first stay was fine (see prior review), but this one was even better. It seems like there has been additional staff training since our first visit, because overall staff attitude has improved. Dual doormen and dual reception desk staff (one is a concierge) greet you as you enter, other staff all greet you as you pass by in the halls, at the pool, at the fitness center. The one front desk person who I remembered gave me misinformation previously, I avoided. The biggest difference with this visit was access to the Club Lounge, a $70 value that is well worth it if you are available everyday for each of the 4 daily food presentations, which we were for this reconnect/disconnect/do nothing weekend. The presentations include: 1) Breakfast, with 2 hot selections, one usually oatmeal, and a wide variety of fresh fruit, carbohydrates (breads, cereals, danish, muffins, etc.) and proteins (hard-boiled eggs, smoked salmon, sliced meats). 2) Mid-day meal, with a selection of gourmet petite sandwiches (including one vegetarian and one seafood), and veggies/salads, plus fabulous house-made potato chips and more. 3) Hors d'oeuvres/cocktails, a selection of dainty small bites, plus 2 hot selections like empanadas, coconut shrimp, and again those fab chips. 4) Desserts/aperitifs, again a selection of dainty bites, including chocolate lollipops. The Lounge staffers are a hardworking bunch of multi-taskers who serve simultaneously are concierges, hosts, waiters, buspeople, bartenders, and food and beverage restockers. For this weekend, the Lounge was busy but not overwhelmingly so, and there were almost no business people. There were usually 2 staff working at a time. The Lounge is a large, comfortable space with sofas, tables and chairs, a private meeting room, multiple TVs and computers. An entire wall of windows faces west, where the Pacific can be glimpsed on a clear day. There are several jars filled with cookies at the door. Dinner is the only meal you have to think about with Lounge access. We dined, once again, at the hotel's WP24 (as in Wolfgang Puck), a fancy Asian place which now has prix-fixe pricing, and also tried the nearby Rivera (chef John Rivera Sedlar, who we remember years ago from the restaurant St. Estephe), which has 4 menus of Latin cuisine served in 3 dining areas. The physical idiosyncrasies of the hotel remain: the tiny lobby, the lack of a bar or meeting area for business, the modern design/decor some find incongruous with the Ritz name. For me, these issues are neither here nor there. Note, Club access is for double occupancy; there may be additional fees if extra people, be they family or business associates, are brought in. I noticed that the hotel no longer puts out a selection of newspapers by the elevators in the morning, although the Club Lounge does (one is also delivered to your room). One morning I think the LA Times delivery was late, so a copy of the paper printed entirely off a computer was delivered instead. Also, the DVD player connection to the TV was confusing, necessitating 2 visits from an engineer. Judging from TA reviews, it seems this new hotel got off to a bit of a bumpy start. Our second visit made it clear the staff has taken heed and has made efforts to improve.

After 5 or 6 calls later, the Guest Relations manager tells me that the order was finally uncovered (probably on a sticky note of some sort), but that it was cancelled claiming that my parents changed their reservation name upon check in, so they then resorted to say that it was not completely their fault due to this alteration. Right... so part of the dilemma is now on my shoulders because their was a simple name change upon check-in? They checked in didn't they? Change the room # on the delivery and make it happen.

Customer Service is golden. You are in the business of servicing guests. That is all. Don't make excuses, just make it right. 2. Hire staff to the standards of your business.

We had to cancel our first reservation back then, but for the July 4 weekend, rates were the lowest we've seen. The Ritz and the adjacent, connected JW Marriott (the hierarchy of hotels in the Marriott group is Ritz Carlton, then JW Marriott, then Marriott) are 2 hotels in the LA Live \"campus\"--a dining and entertainment complex adjacent to the LA Convention Center, Staples Center (home of the LA Lakers and other sports teams, plus a concert venue), and the Nokia Theatre, a smaller venue for live performances. It is not unlike Citywalk at Universal Studios. The LA Live website states the larger Marriott (873 rooms) is geared towards conventioneers and tourists, with the much smaller Ritz (123 rooms) for visiting sports teams, entertainers and their entourages, and executives. The outside hotel signage is a bit misleading. The shorter building is topped with the Marriott sign, while the taller tower says Ritz Carlton and has a rooftop heliport. In fact, both hotels are contained within the first 26 floors of both buildings, with the upper floors of the 54 floor tower housing Ritz Carlton Residences priced at near $900,000 and up. The Marriott occupies floors 4-21, with the Ritz on floors 22-26. The hotels are connected on the first 3 floors. The Marriott's pool deck is on level 4, the Ritz's on floor 26. The Marriott's lobby is of course much larger, with a restaurant, lounges and coffee bar. The Marriott also has many meeting rooms and a huge 3 level ballroom/convention complex. The Ritz's lobby is tiny, with a single sofa and chair and a 2 person counter for front desk and concierge staff. When the Ritz first opened a few months after the Marriott, room rates were well over $100 more costly. Even valet parking was more expensive ($50 vs. $38). For whatever reasons, the Ritz has somewhat reduced its rates, and valet parking now costs the same. Realize rates and availability at both hotels varies considerably based on what's going at the Convention Center and Staples (no rooms were available during the recent NBA finals), but for the July 4 weekend, Ritz's rates were a mere $20 more than Marriott's. This was in spite of a huge Japanese Anime convention being held at the Convention Center as well as the Marriott--tons of costumed young folks everywhere. We fluctuated between booking the I Love LA Live package (includes 10% off all dining and beverage outlets, free valet parking, and 2 free tickets to 2 LA Live venues of your choice--package also available at the Marriott), and getting access to the Club Lounge with its 5 daily food presentations. We opted for the I Love LA package after we were able to secure a pretty coveted dinner reservation for WP24, Wolfgang Puck's newest Asian restaurant and lounge on the 24th floor (I think anytime you can get a discount at a Wolfgang Puck place, it's a good thing). Note that unlike other Ritzes where the Club Level Lounge and rooms are on their own floor, this Ritz has no dedicated club level rooms, since there are only 4 floors of rooms--rather, you pay extra ($70) to get access to the Club Lounge on floor 23. I think everyone is asked at check-in if they want to upgrade, so technically 100% of the guests could have Lounge access. We called ahead to see if early check-in was available, and it was. The valet, bellmen, doormen and front desk staff were all courteous and attentive at all times. We did encounter some inconsistent service primarily when it came to knowing what our package included. When I asked a telephone reservation agent about the package before we booked, she had to put be on hold for so long I had to hang up. One concierge was also unfamiliar with all aspects of the package, and the 10% dining discount was not adjusted off at check-out until we asked. Also, the free valet parking is for one day only--a detail not mentioned previously. The Ritz has a definite water theme and slight Asian theme. We were given a room facing south, with views of the Marriott pool and the LA Live Nokia Plaza and Staples Center. East-facing rooms have similar views, while north-facing rooms overlook the Harbor Freeway and tall downtown LA office buildings. West-facing rooms see Century City office towers in the distance, as well as the Hollywood sign. A room key is needed in the elevators to access room floors and also to access rooms on the 24th floor where WP 24 is. Note that the 25th floor rooms and 26th floor pool deck and fitness center require using a second, separate elevator. The hotels share a business center on the 3rd floor that has daytime hours only and is closed on Sunday. Outside the business center are 3 computers that require a credit card, but Ritz guests can log in a secret access code for complimentary use. The Spa is on the 2nd floor and available to both hotels. The room, a standard Deluxe King, was nicely done, but seemed smaller than its reported 450 square feet (vs. 375 feet at Marriott). The wood paneled carpeted entry way has a sliding wooden door to the bath. Next there is a white lacquered wood floored dressing area with closet, mirror and shelf. You then enter the bedroom, which has a sofa by the window, glass table/desk, flat screen HD TV, DVD player, minibar, espresso maker. The bath had 2 sinks, an enclosed WC, and one of those combination shower-tub rooms that seem to be popular in newly constructed hotels--you walk through the shower to reach the tub. This was our first experience with this design; my first thought was that housekeeping has to clean the tub even if its not used, since using the shower wets the tub. I liked the set-up, since it makes for a roomier shower space than the often cramped shower in traditionally separated showers and tubs. The shower has a rain head and hand-holdable head. WP24 was fabulous. You first pass though the uniquely designed lounge to the smaller, more traditionally designed dining room. Both have great views. The food is Asian, tastes are often familiar, but amped up to the highest level in terms of ingredients, flavour, execution, presentation and service. Some thing are quite spicy. Cocktails delicious. Lee Hefter, original chef at Spago Beverly Hills and now a Managing Partner with the Puck group, was present. I 'm sure he had much input in the restaurant's menu planning, as he has traveled extensively in Asia. WP24 is the Ritz's only restaurant and lounge. The hotel guide in our room says it is open for breakfast and lunch, but this is not the case, nor does it seem feasible. Thus, the Club Lounge is really the only space for the business traveler who must conduct meetings on site. The Marriott has Kerry Simon's LA Market Restaurant that reportedly has a good breakfast buffet, but we did not try it. LA LIVE has scores of dining options as well. We chose to breakfast at a place from our past--The Original Pantry Cafe one block north--a traditional diner open 24 hours since 1924. Besides the LA Live campus, there's not much to do in the immediate vicinity--the attractions of downtown LA are a bit further north, as are numerous hotels, including a traditional Marriott and the historic Biltmore. But this is a good central location from which to travel in any direction.

As others have said, as a business hotel, they are totally unprepared. As a luxury hotel they also fall short compared to either Four Seasons in town. I fully understand fully that this is a very newer property and is no doubt undergoing some opening glitches. However, I could argue that a property like this should be launched only when the staff is 100% up to speed and if that delays an opening by several weeks, so be it. Additionally, I assume that this property was opened with a staff specifically hired and trained for this property. With that in mind I would say our stay was a lot rougher around the edges than I would consider acceptable for a RC. I booked through Platinum American Express (AE) travel services and was told at the time of booking the AE amenities offered by this property. Upon arrival we were taken to the club lounge for check in where the desk person was initially unable to locate our reservation. Once they did there was no mention of any AE-related amenities and when I asked about them, none of the club staff had a clear idea what they were. I recounted what I recalled from my conversation with the AE agent who made my reservation and go a tentative \u201cthat sounds right.\u201d They made no offer to confirm the specifics and get back to us. To be sure, we later asked at the main desk and were given equally vague answers and in the case of the spa credit, incorrect information that we only discovered upon check out. I don\u2019t think I should have to call AE to confirm what my reservation includes. The rest of our stay, from the doormen who never seemed to be near the door, to the indecisive main desk staff who more often then not didn\u2019t even look up when you passed, or the club level staff who never seemed willing to go \u201cany\u201d let alone that extra mile, lacked the sharp edge I would expect, a result of \u201cnot quite\u201d staff training I suspect. The rooms themselves (we had a corner room on 24) have some issues. As mentioned, there is no desk lamp, rather a ceiling light mounted in the center of the room behind the desk chair 5\u2019-6\u201d off the floor that you constantly have to dodge or hit your head on (I\u2019m 6\u2019-1\u201d) and few and completely ill-placed outlets. Also, maybe it was because it was a new property but the material selection for the wardrobe closet may have been a poor one. The resinous material smelled extremely noxious and chemical-like. This odor would impregnate anything that we hung in it thereby rendering the closet useless, a problem for a 4-night stay. It may dissipate from the piece over time but for now I would call it a problem. Also, I know I\u2019m in the minority in this but I am so not loving the new trend in hotel room design of the shower/tub combo room. This RC is not alone in this odd style this one is better than most but it is really neither practical nor functionally IMO. Sorry but to me it is just trendy and awkward. Overall, the hotel presents itself as a Marriott in a tuxedo. The design and style is a notch above a newer Marriott but in this particular property, the extra service that I would expect the staff to deliver that separates a RC from a Marriott is weak or completely missing.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sioux Falls", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Good hotel, Too much money.\u201d", "Author": "WayneBullet", "ReviewID": "UR68782542", "Content": "Ritz Carlton says it all right there.

It is located directly next door to LA Live, making it very convenient to the Staples Center as well as all of the other shops and amenities in the vicinity. Check-in was very quick and I was given exactly the room I requested. The rooms themselves are modern, large, and generally well appointed. The bathroom is huge, with a unique shower/tub arrangement -- they are separate but right next to each other. The rooms overlook LA LIve and, because they are all on high floors, the views are quite good. The bed was very comfortable. Rooms have a mini-bar, although I was never able to locate a price list. Now, for the negatives. I was traveling on business, so the first thing I wanted to do was plug in my computer at the desk. However, there was no electrical outlet to be found anywhere near the desk. The closest one was more 10' away next to the coffee maker. (There as also no desk lamp and no phone at the desk.) The only other plugs I found in the room were: one right inside the main door and four in the bathroom. When I called the front desk to ask if I simply wasn't seeing the outlet (if it was perhaps located behind a panel, etc.), I was told that no one had ever made this complaint before. I later learned that there were no other accessible outlets in the room. I had some internet connectivity issues. They did offer to send someone to my room but it was late and, ultimately, I told them not to bother given the lateness of the hour. I did look for the ethernet cable (which the guest directory said was available) on the theory that a wired connection might be more \"stable.\" Not only did I never find the cable but, if I had, there was no place in the room in which to plug it. The elevator situation was also a bit annoying. Although the hotel is very tall, most of the floors are filled with condos/apartments. The hotel itself is limited to floors in the lower 20s. However, in order to access your room, you must change elevators on the 22nd (or maybe 21st) floor. I was told by the bellman that the reason for this was so that someone could rent out an entire floor. OK, but there must be a better way to accomplish this than by inconveniencing every other hotel guest -- for example, simply lock out the floor to anyone who doesn't have the proper key. Thus, unsure if the reason I was given was wrong but it was inconvenient to have to use two elevators every time I wanted to enter or exit the hotel. As others have said, the lobby is extremely small and is not a place to congregate. The lounge/bar is on the 24th floor. The lounge (black walls, low lights) is dark with very loud music. It obviously appeals to some but I would not say it is a place to relax. The only restaurant is a Wolfgang Puck Asian-style that I didn't try. However, the hotel is steps from many great restaurants so this isn't an issue. I did ask to take a glass of wine to my room; I was told they would have to give me a plastic cup! This is the very first hotel in which this has ever happened. I must add that I did voice my complaints to hotel management, which was very prompt and dutiful in following up with me, providing a measure of \"compensation,\" and doing their best to address retroactively problems which really couldn't be resolved during my visit. Overall, I would recommend the Ritz if you have a downtown even and want a luxurious place to stay or for a romantic getaway WE. If you need to stay at LA Live for business, don't stay here until they upgrade the rooms to be ready for business travelers. The Marriott next door is not as luxurious, is more of a \"commodity,\" and caters to conventions, but definitely is more geared to the business traveler.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cSadly disappointed\u201d", "Author": "SFTravellers415", "ReviewID": "UR66486128", "Content": "I really love the Ritz Carlton and was very excited about staying at the Ritz LA.
