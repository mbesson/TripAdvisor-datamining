But what the hotels in China lack and Kempinski Bristol don't is old time charm and a classy feeling. The service is superb and very friendly. The concierge was extremely helpful. So be prepared that even the superiour rooms are quite small and the design is a bit dated BUT they are lovely. The beds and pillows are very comfortable, plenty of hot water in the shower and double glazed windows. The location is as perfect as it could be. A 10-15 min walk to KaDeWe and 3 minutes to Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. The local bus from Tegel Airport stops right outside the hotel and costs 2,30 EUR. If you think the breakfast a bit to expensive, a bug Starbucks is right opposite the hotel as well. The swimmingpool is very beautiful and the special lift to the SPA area is perfect. If you would like a romantic place to stay in Berlin during a weekend, I highly recommend this hotel.

We also availed of the Hotel's pool area in the basement which is lovely. A nice bright room with loungers and a cocktail bar. People were lying around the pool relaxing, reading their newspapers and having a few drinks. We were in the pool talking (at a normal level) and the Bar Man came over to inform us that we were to stop talking as the room was a \"relaxation room\".

Transfer from Sch\u00f6nefeld airport straight forward. 3Euros into Zoo Gdns then 5min walk down main road so felt safe. It is not very clear but when you buy a ticket for the transport in Berlin you have to then VALIDATE it or you can be fined. Machines can be found easily on the train platforms once you know they are there but they are not glaringly obvious if you do not look for them. There is an underground station virtually outside but by the time you have changed trains it is quicker to walk. Impressive from the outside with lots of lights (was Christmas time) and red carpet up the stairs and old fashioned dressed doorman and luggage boys (although the ones we saw were girls). Lovely Christmas tree in the lobby. Check-in efficient and heard the staff speaking several languages, they were certainly fine with English. They also were helpful in assisting us with a choice of markets and travel advice. Recommend the Welcome Berlin card as this allows 2 or 3 day travel on any form of public transport plus reductions in several museums (and they were ones you might actually want to visit such as the Jewish museum and the DDR museum), just don't forget to validate your ticket ! Room pleasant and we felt large.I think it was in the old side but didn't see a new side so not sure. Bed very comfortable but 2x single duvets which was different- stopped the husband hogging though so might think about it at home!! We didnt have a suite but there was a hall way of sorts with separate door to bathroom and bedroom. Old style TV with vast choice of channels for all languages. Only news and sport in English but as we were there for culture and the Christmas markets it was not a problem. Bathroom clean and serviceable with toiletries. Usual weak hairdryer situated i the bathroom.Towels thin and definitely not fluffy but this suits me. Bathrobes had also not been washed with fabric conditioner but were a nice touch. Only complaint was that the walls were thin and we were woken on 2 mornings by our neighbour's alarm/phone vibrating on the table and then him running a bath. Didn't think this was right for 5* hotel hence only 4 stars. Our deal did not include breakfast but you could have an American b'fast for 25Euro each or continental for 16 each. We did not bother but if you want anything other than McDonald's b'fast or coffee with bread variety you may struggle finding something in the immediate vicinity. We went for a swim in the hotel pool which is relaxing. Towels and robes provided as is locker key. Pool area clean with loungers and refreshment area. Sauna is mixed but beware it is naked. There is a dry and wet sauna with showers and cold plunge area. There are no showers in the changing rooms (which are single sex) which would have been useful. The first bar was quite open and we felt lacked atmosphere but the second bar further down the corridor was more intimate and allowed for a relaxing drink and chill out after foot pounding various markets. Area around the hotel is quite upmarket with other guests arriving in chauffeur driven Mercs/BMWs with fur (and I think they were genuine) coats and designer clothes/shoes. We felt quite scruffy in jeans and jumpers with walking coats and boots but the hotel staff did not appear to mind.

We had a junior suite in the \"old\" part of the hotel. The room itself was very spacious with slightly dated but comfortable furniture. The walk-in closet off of the entryway is ideal for storing luggage and clothing and was a real plus in making the space feel less like a hotel room. The one thing that was really dated was the television, a boxy non-flat screen. The new part of the hotel has flatscreens (I asked). The bathroom had a tub hand-shower combo, which worked well. Just a word to anyone with physical disabilities: you have to be agile to get into the tub and it requires just as much balance to get out. We had a corner view onto the Kudamn which was a nice touch. The type and location of the room makes a huge difference at this hotel, as it is an older non-cookie cutter property. Some singles are tiny while others are spacious. Dining: We had breakfast at the hotel each of the days that we stayed there, as it was included in room rate. I suggest trying to get a rate with breakfast included, otherwise full breakfast is 25 Euros. We did not tire of the breakfast selection, as it was fresh, with an ample selection of fruits, cereals, cheeses, breads etc. Nice selection of juices, teas and coffee. Staff was very friendly and attentive. A solid A. Other dining: We ate dinner here twice and once had afternoon \"kaffee und kuchen.\" Good selection but pricey, so look at the menu prior to make a reseravtion. Overall: Staff at front desk was spot on, conceirge was also very helpful, as were the bellmen. Pool is large by Berlin standards, also a touch dated but very relaxing to lounge by. Small shops in hotel are a nice touch and my mother used the hairdresser and was impressed by the professionalism and quality. Location really gets an A+.

No information was given, at the time of booking, no information was given at the time of check in, and there were no information in the room about the closure. So it was a little hard for me to explain it to my son when we stood in our \"speedos\" infront of a closed pool. It was really poor service from the hotels side, and I was really surprised over the lack of information. I travel alot around the world with my job, and I have never been mis-informed in that way in even a 3 star hotel. When I asked in the reception about the lack of information, the guy at the desk just started looking at the internet and tried to see if there were any information on the webside, - which is still today not the case!!! then he called the sales dept. to find out why it was not there. Then he claimed that it was on my booking confirmation, which again was not the case. Only after this bla bla bla... he offered us to go to the pool at another hotel, 15 min. away. Well, it was an fine offer but just not what you are after with a small child, and absolutely not what I had booked and expected. The room - a superiour - was of a good size, but the smell in the bathroom was unbelievable. It smelled like there was a direct connection to the sewer, and only after complaining 2 days in a row, they managed to do anything about it. So the smell changed from sewer to an Over dose of mouth wash. The Breakfast buffet at the price of 25 Euro was OK, but not more than that, compared to the service and food offerings you can get at other 4 and 5 stars hotels arond the world. And 25 Euro is absolutely in the high end. So in conclusion - will I go back to Kempinski in Berlin?

On the 29th November, 2010 the undersigned booked 3 hotel rooms through Metglobal for the weekend 3rd to 5th December, 2010. The 3 rooms were for my twin sister and her husband, my parents and the undersigned with wife \u2013 to celebrate our 50th birthday party in Bristol Kempinski Berlin, which was a long standing wish/dream for all of us. On the 2nd December my father was urgently taken to the hospital in Aarhus, Denmark for immediate surgery. After having checked the situation with the hospital and my father, the rest of us decided still to go to Berlin, as this was the wish from our father. Subsequently we cancelled ONE room repeat ONE room out of the 3 reserved rooms on the 2nd December in the evening through Metglobal through whom we had booked the rooms In order to avoid any unexpected last minute surprises, and to make sure everyone were informed properly, we furthermore sent a separate email to Metglobal and called the hotel to advise about the changes the very same evening. We were informed by the hotel that no cancellation was received from Metglobal, but in any case everything would be taken care of, i.e. the 2 rooms for us were fine, and the one room for my parents would be cancelled. After a 650 kilometre and 8 hour drive through heavy snow, we were all looking forward to a well deserved rest and comfort in a nice 5 star hotel. To put it mildly big was our shock to be informed on arrival, after having been given the preprinted check in formulars from the very same gentleman, who informed us the evening before that all ok, that now suddenly for some sort of reason Bristol Kempinski was fully booked and all 3 rooms had indeed been cancelled. A 50 minute phone conversation with Metglobal (in USA) didn\u2019t bring any solutions whatsoever, apart from even more costs, this time telephone charges \u2013 after one hour Bristol Kempinski eventually gave us a proposal to get two rooms for an additional euro 260 per night, which would then go on top of our euro 450 cancellation fee, i.e. a total of euro 372,50 per room instead of the booked fee of euro 150 per night. Needless to say Friday late afternoon in Berlin on the 2nd Advent weekend no great chances to get a decent hotel room, so having stayed one night only in another hotel next to the rail track at own costs on top of the euro 450 cancellation fee, which we had already paid for not sleeping at Kempinski !! we packed our suitcases Saturday morning and drove back 650 kilometre on our 50th birthday, as the Kempinski experience didn\u2019t leave much interest and mood to celebrate further in Berlin.

Upon arrival at the front desk, I gave my reservation number, clearly saying that it was for a superior - non smoking room. When we got to our room (609), we noticed right away the cigarette smell. We also saw an ashtray with matches on the desk. So we went back to the front desk asking for another room. When we got to the 2nd room (525), we immediately saw that it was much smaller and older. We went back to the front desk, telling them that they had made a mistake, giving us a standard room. They said that we were wrong but nevertheless gave us another room. We showed them a picture of a superior room, taken from their web site. They laughed and said \"oh, you want a room like on the picture? If it's what you want, sure we can give one to you\".

In particular, the Maranello one block away is a good choice for authentic, good value Italian food with attentive, welcoming service. Unfortunately, we also witnessed the other end of the spectrum at Capones on the Ku'damm. We sat for 40 minutes without having as much as our drinks order taken. Our waiter was a caricature, attempting flair and charm but not managing the most basic things such as taking a drinks order or asking if we wished to order dinner.

The room was also very crowded with the usual German double-twin set-up and both a desk chair and easy chair taking up most of the available space. Mirrored entry hall and a large window kept it from being claustrophobic, though. And the towels and bedding were lush and up to five-star standards.

The second room was bright, freshly renovated, and everything you could ask for. On our second stay - same story. First room assigned was sub prime and we immediately asked to move.

OUR ROOM. Was on the 5th floor and by the time the elevator door has opened a terrible smell[--] hit us.We thought that this would be only in the corridor but boy we were so wrong.Our room had the same horrible smell and espessially the toilet.The misfortune did not stop here.The decoration of the room was shoking, the firniture were 60 years old, some of them broken, and by the side of the window there were vitrines with scaring statues inside. We were so disappointed but we could not go anywhere else because these were the only 5* rooms that we found in the internet for these dates. So we started to joking about this with our friends(we were two couples) and late at night we went to sleep. Around 8 in the morning we wake up from the noise.So long my sweet sleep. We thought that the housekiping ladies had a fight and shouting to each other but after this continued for two hours and the other couple told us that the same thing happened to them(their room was far away from us) we realized that this was the staffs attitude problem and lack of respect.Around 10.30 i went down to the lobby to tell my beefs and ask for another room.But the girl in the reception was not polite at all and seemed not to understand me.At the end they gave us a new room same as the other but not so smelly on the 4th floor.

Beware - this is not a luxury hotel, however it might describe itself. It may have been once, many many years ago, but it is most certainly not one now. If you normally stay at budget hotels you\u2019ll doubtless be very happy, but if you\u2019re used to better standards you\u2019re likely to be very disappointed. The standard rooms are very very small indeed - certainly not what you'd expect from a supposedly 5 star hotel. Think in terms of a budget hotel chain such as Travelodge in the UK and you'll have an idea of what to expect. Furnishings are OK, but nothing special. Best description would be adequate and tired. Light fittings were very worn, for example, and needed replacing. No room safe. No coffee making facilities. Space to store only one small suitcase, and very limited wardrobe and other storage space too - would have been OK for a single traveller, but not for two of us. Beds were also small: again I expected better than this from a supposedly 5 star hotel. Bathroom was OK, but nothing special. The shower was a basic \u2018over the bath\u2019 type, with a weak flow rate. It was not even thermostatically controlled. Old-fashioned stuff, this. The heating was either on or off \u2013 again no thermostat to control the temperature of the room. Even with the heating off, though, the room stayed far too hot unless the window was open (this in November too). Trouble was, once you opened the window there was even less space in this tiny room. Our view was of a ventilation system (see photo). Check out the required standards in Germany for a five star hotel and you\u2019ll find that there are certain minimum standards. For example: * Double rooms 26 m2 * Personalized guest welcome with flowers and/or sweets in the room * Second service in the evening We saw no sign of either of the last two, and the hotel\u2019s own website says that the standard rooms are only 21m\u00b2. This is in line with UK budget hotel room sizes \u2013 draw your own conclusions. If you\u2019re happy with that, fine. If you\u2019re expecting a luxury hotel you\u2019re going to be very disappointed. Oh, and if you take a look at the guestlist on the website, you might initially be impressed. You\u2019ll see names like Walt Disney, Ronald Reagan, Gregory Peck and John Wayne. Fine, but this was many years ago \u2013 where are the stars staying now? Not here, I guess. Then there are the Famous Quotes, also on the website. The last ones shown are as follows. Draw your own conclusions. Ronan Keating, singer, 2002 \"All the best and thanks for everything\" Armin Mueller-Stahl, actor, 2003 \"Yours loyally...\" Uwe Ochsenknecht, actor, 2003 \"A little like at home\" Melanie C, singer, 2003 \"Thank you for a lovely stay\" On the positive side, and to give a balanced picture, the breakfast was very good. All the usual fare for a decent international buffet breakfast, eggs, bacon, sausage, cheeses, meats etc etc. You wouldn't go hungry! And the croissants were fresh too - highly unusual these days. Pastries were good too. It will cost you 25 Euros, though, so maybe it should be good. Staff were pleasant and very helpful, particularly at breakfast. The big problem remains the rooms. Which is a shame, because that's what you're really paying a hotel for, and if they can't get that right............ The standard rooms are budget rooms dressed up as luxury. Luxury they are not.

Having got a good deal on Expedia (\u00a3266 for three nights room only), we were not expecting huge luxury and boy, for the first night we did not get it either! Our room was tidy and clean and on the first floor. We later discovered it was directly above the 'Bristol Bar' and that there was a private function that evening. The music was so loud in our room that glasses on the bedside table were vibrating and you could actually hear the words of each of the (cheesy) songs. It took 4 calls to reception to speak to a manager and, as the hotel was full, we could not be offered a different room. As it was so bad, the manager sent out for earplugs for us, which arrived an hour later (around 1.30am) and the music stopped around 2.30am. So far, so poor. However, as guests were checking out on the following day, the hotel did move us to a much nicer room higher up in the building for our remaining two nights, which was very pleasant. A complimentary bottle of champagne also eased the trauma of the first night. So overall \"null points\" for the first night and probably 4 for the last two. The hotel generally is in a great location and has a super pool and spa for relaxing after those long days around town. The service is unexceptional (slightly uninterested, but you get what you ordered.....eventually) and all of the public bars and restaurants are smoking areas. The Grill Restaurant is an enjoyable 80s throwback experience and I noticed that many of its dishes also appeared on the other Kempi restaurant's menu at about E10 less... The buffet breakfast is delish, but not great value unless you eat your main meal first thing. Head round the corner to the Uhlandstr \"Rosti\" cafe for breakfast and fantastic fresh coffee. You should assume you won't be able to get the English language Film channel at busy times of the year as this has extremely limited availability.

My son really enjoyed the spa area, even though he is a teenager.

We got it at a great price and as we were there as tourists and really did not spend that much time in the hotel so if that's your plan then it's a good place. It is not worth spending big bucks on though - I would certainly not put it in the plush or deluxe category, more 'comfortable tourist'. The lobby is quite elegant, but the bedrooms are small and furnished in cheap looking wooden furniture. The soft furnishings did seem clean, but quite dated and not luxurious at all. The bathroom was standard, again no touches of luxury there i.e. no body lotion, no toothbrush, but there were robes.

Facilities: We got a great deal on a junior suite for \u20ac199, well worth it. Room was big with a great walk in closet, nice bathroom and large dining table as well as coffee table with couches. They offer 6 different types of bedding and are only too happy to accomodate with these requests, or any others at all. Leisure: My fiance took advantage of a massage and found it excellent. The pool area is very relaxing with a bar. The hotel also offers a salon and sauna - al fresco! Food/Drink: Large selection at the breakfast buffet, but the hot food was luke warm at best. The formal restaurant looked very nice but we really aren't into the artsy menu. A fillet steak was \u20ac34 which I seldom will pay and didn't. The hotel lounge was large, comfortable and great for champagne by the fire or afternoon tea. The hotel has the Bristol bar located at the back of the lounge but if you didn't wear a dark pinstripe suit and had celebrated at least 65 birthdays, you got looks! Staff: All staff was top-notch, extremely helpful. Overall: Having stayed in various 5 star hotels, I would highly recommend this hotel and I would not be one to do so without good reason.

We placed at the first floor at the 147 no which was a smoking room, without being asked when checking in. Therefore smoke was penetrating from the connecting door from the next room, which was completing annoying especially at the night sleep.
