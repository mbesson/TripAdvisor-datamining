Great holiday. Great hotel. Close to Metro and easily accessible from everywhere. Also close to the airport. Friendly staff. Wouldn't recommend their restaurant though as it is pricey with very little choice. However, there is a very conveniently placed supermarket just up the road which stays open till 10pm and also serves baguettes and sandwiches etc. Aristos Hotel is just in the right place for easy access and convenience.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ballymena", "Title": "\u201cExpensive and disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Nana077", "ReviewID": "UR21058494", "Content": "Unlike the previous reviewer we found the accommodation very disappointing and very expensive - 160 Euro for aroom for one night , breakfast not included. The reception area was pleasant enough and the staff very helpful but the stair carpet was cheap, shabby and dirty and our room (401 ),beyond the reach of the lift, was in need of redecoration and refurbishment. We had a couple of grubby easy chairs and a neglected, rusty bacony with broken tiles and cigarette butts. We would NOT recommend the accommodation to anyone. The food in the cafe was much superior to the accommodation.", "Date": "October 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cResumen\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR645753", "Content": "I stayed three nights in august 2002 at this hotel.
