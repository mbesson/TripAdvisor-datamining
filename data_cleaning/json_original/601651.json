The hotel is spotless and all of our contacts with staff have been positive. The suites are clean and comfortable with magnificent ocean views from the bedroom as well as the balcony. The balcony is clean and furnished with a glass table and 2 chairs. Housekeeping is done in a very timely fashion daily. I brought Clorox wipes just to freshen up the kitchen, but they were not necessary! The pools are clean and the children's lovely private water park is sparkling clean and well staffed with diligent lifeguards! There are plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas at both the adult pool and the kiddie water park and fresh towels are available at the pools. The adult outside pool has a swim- up bar and servers are available at both pools for food and drinks. The beach is clean and well cared for. There is a Starbucks in the lobby. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the more formal restaurant is not very good, but with all of the choices in the area it didn't bother me.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Throop, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Oceanfront Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jooheaThroop", "ReviewID": "UR140148722", "Content": "This is the 4th time we have stayed at this hotel and we can't wait to go back again. It is the perfect place for families to stay, especially if you have children! The Hilton has a beautiful location that gives you the perfect oceanfront experience. The hotel offers two outdoor heated pools, one meant for adults that includes a swim up pool bar and is next to the sandwich and burger stand. Prices are not cheap but are what you expect at his type of facility. it also has a fantastic kids pool with water slides and spouting water geysers which the children love. The kids pool is shallow and is about 4 feet at its deepest point. There is also an indoor pool for any rainy days. The hotel also has a restaurant which offers breakfast and dinner as well as a lounge for some evening relaxation. Prices are fairly high during the summer but start to drop after Labor Day which is a great time to visit due to the smaller crowds and more open beaches. The suites offer everything anyone would need. There is a kitchen area with refrigerator, microwave, stove, and all the necessities. There is a living room area with a flatscreen t.v. and a pull out couch that serves as another potential sleeping area. The bedroom offers the most comfortable beds and pillows anywhere. It also has a flatscreen t.v. and a balcony that offers the most beautiful views of the Atlantic Ocean. I would highly recommend the Hilton to anyone looking for a nice stay in beautiful Ocean City, Maryland!", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAwesome family vacation!\u201d", "Author": "Kim8888", "ReviewID": "UR139854036", "Content": "My husband and our 2 children 17 months and 3.5 yrs old just returned from a post labor day vacation. We had a fantastic time. The suites are perfect for families we had breakfast and lunch in our room most days. The staff we came in contact with in every location of the hotel were fantastic. Everyone was very polite and welcoming. I really have no complaints at all. I would advise to get the best bargain go just before or after peak season for rates that are 50% less. While I do love this hotel, I will not return for $500+ a night. I will be back however next year the week of labor day! The pool is the best around for small children. Our kids had such a great time! The water slides and shallow depths made for hours and hours of fun. Our first night there, to my horror, we returned from the boardwalk and looked outside and found that the pool had been emptied! OMG, this could have ruined our vacation. I called the front desk and they assured me that the pool will be fun and warmed for the kids in the morning. I was shocked to find that the pool really was full and the heat was going all day long. They kept the heat on for the kids to use the pool all week long, very impressive. The indoor pool could have been a bit warmer. We did use the indoor pool the day we had rain. It seemed they did run a hose with hot water to the pool but it wasn't really helping. The food is excellent in the restaurants and at the pool. The drinks are fantastic, happy hour prices are $3 for any beers and the wait staff was always nearby.

Plenty of places within walking distance to buy take out breakfast or lunch including all your fast food chains. Although it has great rooms, very good service, very nice pools I still think rooms rates around Labor day are grossly overpriced but because we are member of the Hilton club and get at least some of the nights as part of rewards program the cost ends up to be reasonable.

The rooms were spacious enough. We had a standard oceanview suite. You enter to a LR with pullout sofa, dresser/TV and small table with 4 chairs, go through a galley kitchen with a full bath with jacuzzi tub into a BR with 2 queens and sliders to a balcony overlooking the beach. We had 2 adults and 3 teens/preteens and faired well with the amount of space for 4 nights. Beds were super comfy.The suite is cleaned daily but most days it was late in the day when we were coming back from the beach so it wasn't ready for us to shower but they were quick about finishing up. There are 2 outdoor pools. One for adults and families with a swim up bar, and one for families and smaller children with sprinklers and a small water slide. The outdoor pools close at dusk. There is a very good size indoor pool as well and that is open until midnight. There is a game room for the kids and a restaurant and bar. It's a big hotel so the pools were pretty crowded. The hotel is right on the beach so you go from the lobby down some steps to the sand. There is an OC lifeguard station right at the hotel in season. The beach was clean and well kept. Note: When the wind was blowing from the east, there were hardly any bugs. Apparently when the wind blows from the west, there are tons of flies on the beach. We had 2 days like this and they were nasty and bit us all until we had to leave the beach late in the day. I don't think this is the norm but bring strong bug spray to be safe if you plan on being at the beach. Ocean City is definitely a coin operated town and there isn't much to do that doesn't cost. We ate at a few local places and the checks were about 25% higher than I typically pay for the same meals locally or on the FL coast where we spend a lot of time. The boardwalk was very busy but not terribly noisy so it was tolerable. It's good to take a walk and see the sights at night. Our favorite thing we did was pack a lunch, bathing suits and towels and headed to Assateague Island. The wild ponies were right there on the beach with us and it was very cool. Most of the staff at the Hilton except for the front desk and bellmen seemed to be seasonal staff mostly eastern European women. I learned that they come and work for the summer and send $$ home. As noble as that is and maybe they were all worn out because it was the end of the summer, but most seemed to be phoning it in and not really into their jobs. This is not what I typically see at Hilton properties. I was staying the weekend on HiltonHonors points not cash so it didn't pain me as much. All in all I would recommend the hotel for anyone who wants to go to OC. The beach is beautiful the rooms are nice, but manage your expectations.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "pocomoke md", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon stay.

This was the worst mistake we could have made. The people who left the good reviews must not have very high standards. I will start off saying the lobby of the hotel was nice but that is the only good thing I can say. We got to our room and the room was filthy. The bed duvets had stains all over them as well as the sheets. It looked like they hadn't been washed in months. We then checked the bed and found evidence of bed bugs to include eggs. They moved us to another room and the supervisor of housekeeping was waiting for us and told us that they were going to remake the beds becuase she herself found that those sheets were unacceptable. The mattreses looked ok in that room so we agreed to stay. After wasting two hours of changing rooms and having them reclean we decided to just have dinner in the hotel at 32the Palms. The food was disgusting and wait staff was rude and never even brought refills we asked for. My two yr old daughter got a grilled cheese and it was like a brick. Ridiculous! When we got back to our room we went to get a bath and found that none of the jets in the tub worked. Then we went out to the balcony and found that it was infested with ants so they had to send maintenance to spray out there at 10 at night. After all of that we decided to just check out and go to another hotel the next morning. At first they were hesistant about letting us cancel the remainder of our trip without charging us, I could not believe that. After arguing the managers response was well it appears we don't meet your expectations so you can leave. They were so rude about everything. I have never been treated so badly at a hotel. I am truly appauled by this especially because it is a Hilton and the price they charge. Even the pools were not kept clean, there were dead bugs and sand everywhere. If just once they would have apologized and offered to make the situation right I would have no problem staying at another Hilton in the future, but they did not. I would not ever return to this hotel and now no other Hilton eithetr because if this is how they train their staff to treat people then no thank you.

Having said that, the hotel is very nice. The rooms are very clean with pretty decor. The big sliding glass door in the bedroom with 2 awesome queen beds overlooks a gorgeous ocean view. We were only given the choice of floor 2 or 4 and we picked 4 so we would be higher. We would have preferred even higher as you seem so close to the pool, music and ALL the activity and noise that goes with that. Every need we had was promptly met. Example, our room had not been clean yet by 3:00 PM, we called down to the front desk courteously and someone was sent up within 5 mins. We needed a cot one evening, made the courteous call and received a cot promptly. Continental breakfast - we were offered it but were confused as to where we could get our food, drinks, etc. Maybe the staff could have been a bit more clear. Not sure where the fresh fruit I heard about from previous reviewers was. Laundry- was complimentary, no quarters needed, and was an absolute wonderful perk. 2 washers and 2 dryers per floo. Ordering a movie - was outrageous @ 16.99 for 1. It was something we normally wouldn't do but it was a rainy day and we had a few hours to kill. Wish the prices were more competitive.

The rooms are well appointed with two separate rooms a decent size kitchen and large bathroom with a jacuzzi. I heard from other guests about various problems they encountered but our stays have been spared any headaches with this year being maybe somewhat of an exception. Nevertheless, I rate it five stars for everything that it has to offer. Excellently spaced rooms, three pools, access to a very large beach, a gorgeous view from any floor above the first level, many free kids activities from arts and crafts to cooking classes and daily movie nights, concierge services, a really decent poolside food service (that could stay open a little longer) and Coffeshop (with some Starbucks products). The staff is overall very courteous and helpful. Is it perfect? No, but what on earth is perfect. The high cost of a room is not that unreasonable if you consider the two two room with two queen beds, a queen pull-out sleeper sofa and plenty of room for kids air mattresses or a hotel-provided crib. We book every year at least 8 months ahead to not run into any booking issues. I would have plenty more to say about the logistics of getting these large rooms ready for customers trying to check in earlier then 3 PM while allowing other to stay later than 11:00 AM at the same time keeping the rooms to a standard of cleanliness that is necessary. Needless to say, there is lefty of room to complain if you have a hotel full of Hilton Diamond and Gold members who play their membership level trump card quite frequently. I love this place and would not consider staying anywhere else while in OC. I consider it a home away from home. A few ways to improve would be to train staff in the following: - No bellman bs stories necessary if you don't want to share your carts at 8:30 PM. I doubt that 2 of 3 carts have flat tires. The bellmen are mostly very senior, so train the rookies in proper conduct. Keeps the tips flowing in the long-run. - I should not have my floor neighbor open my room door with his key. What was that all about? I call my own customers personally for something less important. - If customers voice concern about some clearly offensive hotel guests who need to show their white hoodie confederate flag pride shirtless (not making this up), a call from the hotel manager would be OK to calm down some nerves. This is America and freedom of speech is key and people can ink whatever they please. At least you asked for a cover up. - You need to figure out a way to get the rooms serviced while working around your other constraints and guest personal schedules. Why not just ask a guest what works for them during their stay?

By far the best thing about the hotel is the location. It sits directly on the beach with great views of the ocean from the room balcony and access from the first and ground floors. It appears to be a private beach for hotel guests only; and, although it does fill up, there was always a spot to put down towels or beach chairs and be fairly close to the water. There are two chair and umbrella rental kiosks down at the beach for those wanting to spend the whole day. Also, the hotel is located quite close to a number of shops and restaurants and is within a half-mile or so of the beginning of the bordwalk. We walked down and took the tram for $3.00 a piece (each way) down to where all the action is further down....very convenient. The suite itself is a small living room area with a pullout couch, a galley kitchen, large bathroom with two sinks, and a large bedroom with a balcony overlooking the pools and beach area. The living room is small and dark because of the way the room is situated with the windows at the back toward the beach. The pullout couch was not comfortable and my son ended up sleeping directly on the couch. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom had decent toiletries and plenty of towels. Service was good. My one complaint is that the entire property, which is fairly new, seems a bit worn already. The pool had a constant film of sand in it from people coming in from the beach. It never seemed to be fully cleaned out. The bar area down by the beach was grimy and our table was not cleaned when we sat down (only plates and drink cups were removed). The carpet and walls were a bit stained in the room. The whole place seemed like it was in need of a good cleaning and paint job. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay.

We're Hilton Honors customers, so we expected nothing but the best. We arrived at the Hilton and were promptly checked in. The room was gorgeous. Everything was meticulously clean, so we were very excited about being there. The view was AWESOME!!! We were on the top floor and since it was off season, the entire city was rather quiet. We had 2 complimentary vouchers for the breakfast buffet Friday morning. When we got to the restaurant, 32 Palms, we were informed that there was no buffet that morning. We were then told that our vouchers were worth $15. We were displeased, but we had to eat, so we ordered breakfast. My husband found hair on his steak. We called the waitress over and she apologized profusely. She went to get her manager. The manager didn't come out at all. The waitress then took the steak off of the bill. As she was leaving she informed us that her tip wasn't included in the bill. I was a little irritate by this time, so hearing her campaign for a tip wasn't exactly what I needed at the moment. We paid the bill and went immediately to the service counter to let the Manager know what had taken place. My husband then asked that the package price be adjusted to reflect the fact that we had to pay for breakfast. We were assured that it would be rectified.

I looked at the reviews and found the Hilton to have the best review of all OC hotels. It was a bit pricey, but decided to shell out to make sure we had a good time. The hotel itself is excellent. From bellman to the cleaning crew, the staff is extremely friendly. We had a first floor room by the adult pool side and it was so convenient to go to the pool/beach right out of our balcony. Initially I thought maybe the noise would be too much, but the doors and curtains do a great job of keeping a lot of the noise out. I loved the fact that there is a separate sleeping area (living room). We set up my kid's pack n play there and shut our bedroom door and it was perfect. We were able to watch TV and talk without having to worry about waking him up. The full kitchen is also amazing. Fully stocked and a full fridge. We brought our own breakfast and made them each morning. If you leave your dirty dishes in the sink, the cleaning crew will load them up in the dishwasher and run them for you. The towels are soft, bathroom is clean, the jacuzzi is awesome, and next to our own bed, probably one of the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in. My wife has a back condition (we have a special bed made for her at home) and normally she can't sleep in hotel beds very well, but she actually didn't complain the entire 5 days we spent there. The beach was clean and it was literally a minute walk. The kiddie pool was a HUGE hit with my son who loved every minute of it. I have to admit, the kiddie pool is excellent. All equipment is soft/padding so even if kids fall on it, they don't get hurt as much. It even had a lazy river! We ate out most of the nights but had couple of dinners (including room service) from Palm 32. Food was excellent and so was the service. Starbucks right in the lobby was a huge hit and their lunch place next to the adult pool serves great wraps with a friendly smile. We walked to the boardwalk and it wasn't bad. Probably about 10-15 min walk to the edge and another 10-15 to where the restaurants were. We took the shuttle back, but on a nice day, it's totally doable and not tiring at all. I could go on and on, but basically the price is on the high range side (~$500/night peak months) but if you have a family and looking for great service and amenities, this hotel is worth every penny. Our last day there it rained so we couldn't go to the pool but they had movie and art class for kids and we spent time there coloring and watching Finding Nemo on the big screen. Worth every penny.

The swim up bar is definitely a plus and the duo that played was good. The location is great. You aren't on the boardwalk, but yet only 2 blocks or so from it, where you can jump on the trolley for a couple of bucks. Cons: I had mentioned before that there are a lot of chairs by the pool, well be warned, people put towels on them very early. I watched people do it at 730am. They will \"claim\" all the chairs by the railing which over looks the ocean. I sat next to 4 chairs that had towels on them from 11am-3pm and the people who put them on the chairs NEVER even sat in them. I think there should be a stronger policy that no claiming of chairs for more than an hour is acceptable. Especially when the chairs haven't even been touched. Please enforce a rule that there should not be children by the swim up bar. I watched kids splash water in to peoples 9$ drinks. Luckily not mine. There's a great kiddie pool area with a waterslide. Seriously folks, the kids don't need to be by the bar. The other issue I had, was breakfast. It wasn't very good and pretty darn expensive. 14$ for eggs and bacon is ridiculous, especially when your beverage is served in a plastic cup. There are many other options for breakfast. Unless it's included, skip the Hilton's. Also, I ate by myself the one morning and I was the only person in the restaurant. A table of 8 (screaming kids included) were sat directly next to me. WHY?

Its maybe two star places then this nice 4 star hotel. There is a new Hampton being built but its not on the ocean and beach side. The Hilton is shockingly expensive, We've stayed in Ritz Carltons, Intercontinentals, Westins across the world and have only once paid more for a room....ugh. That aside its a really nice place with ample service. The Rooms: Are HUGE! You walk into a living room with a pull out couch and a table and chairs. Past that is a galley kitchen with almost full size appliances and fully stocked with everything you need. Next to that is a very large bathroom with dual sinks and a deep large soaking jetted tub with rain shower. (watch your step in and out of the tub, its tall) Next is the bedroom, we had a king bed that made the room feel very large. Bed was soft yet comfortable. Other travelers pics on here are true to what our room looked like. Room was well kept, it should be, the hotel is not that old. The bummer is that you can't leave the door open to the balcony and have any part of the air unit working, not even the fan on to move air around. We like to sleep at night with the sound of the ocean waves and have the benefit of some cool air over us, oh well. The towels and robes are SUPER soft, very much enjoyed having them. Amenities: There are three pools. Wow. An adult pool, although officially I don't think they kick kids out. It has a swim up bar and another bar in the area. We had a different band playing daily in that area which is ok, not great since they weren't very good, but the idea is nice. The other option is a kids play area with slides and tons of fun things for them. Thirdly there was an indoor pool which was warm and chlorine smelly as usual. The pool towels are a shame. I suppose most people bring their own beach towels since most people visiting drive in from a few hours drive. We came with carry-ons only for a week stay from Phoenix, so, they sucked. Location: On the beach with ample parking for people staying, either covered or uncovered. Nice beach out front. The boardwalk is probably a half mile to the south, so if that is important to you look elsewhere. Easy to find the hotel anytime since all you have to do is look up, its the tallest hotel around. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance, and the same cheesy stores every tenth of a mile so no reason to drive everywhere. Hints: -Ask for a high room on the side of the adult pool. It gets really noisy on the kid pool side very early in the morning (we found out the hard way). -The coke machines on each floor are a deal, $1 for a 20oz, not bad and convenient. We didn't have any security issues, or problems with staff, we didn't really care when they came to make up our room since we were not in it very much. Maids do have to clean the rooms where people are checking out first you know, so that when you arrive early at 1 and expect that your room is ready hours earlier then the posted check in time, it actually is ready. Sorry to hear others had troubles. This was my first trip to Ocean City, not really my style, more of a east coasters paradise I guess.

Even if the front desk says that they do the rooms anytime between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., our experience was after 3:00 p.m. only after we asked that the room be freshened. Second, we struggled with our entry door and its key. We could not get the door to unlock after we had the keys replaced. We showed our problem to a maintenance person on happened to be on our floor and he agreed that the internal battery needed to be replaced. He stated to us that he would arrange to have someone look at it. We decided to inform the front desk as well as a backup request. Well as you can imagine, it was never fixed. We would stand outside of our room for several minutes before we could get the door to open. Third, some may think the rain shower in the oversized bathtub is wonderful. Well they will change their mind once they use it. The majority of the nozzles are clogged so water barely comes out. My wife and i struggled rinse our hair or body after soaping up. While we are shower issue, the tub is too high to step into. For my wife who is 5'4\", she struggled to step into the tub. In my opinion, one should be very careful to not slip. Other then the three items above, our experience was just okay. Lisa at the front desk is not the sharpest tool in the shed.

No doubt the location is fantastic - beach and pool options (indoor & 2 outdoor). The rooms have great amenities. Full kitchen with fridge, 4-burner stove/oven, microwave, dishwasher, and dishes/utensils - but bring your own kitchen knife and cutting board because these are lacking or not useful. (Given the reviews of the hotel food, we bring breakfast and lunch, eat in the room or at the pool/on the beach, and save our bucks for dinner since dining options are dodgy anyway - Liquid Assets is a rare treasure). Bathroom is spacious (though the deep whirlpool tubs are a challenge - you could throw your back out bathing a child and getting in and out is best done gingerly and soberly). There's an exercise room and business center (probably underused). That said, I noticed increasing signs of neglect - hall floors not vacuumed for days; black oily hand (not just finger) print on bathroom door; no robes in the rooms anymore (this was a perk that I really enjoyed - now, you have to call down to the front desk and housekeeping will bring one for you...not sure how long that will last); and, inconsistent housekeeping (missing soap one day; missing dishwasher detergent the next - and front desk said housekeeping would drop some off which didn't happen - and so on, all despite the tip $ I left since I get that housekeeping is a thankless task). Perhaps petty, but given the cost, excellence should be expected. Some parting tips: Rooms ending in 1 to 10 are on the kids' pool side of the hotel, which can be loud. My husband could hear a wee screamer with the slider closed on the 6th floor (which met with some disbelief from the front desk) - ask for a higher room or stay on the opposite side of the hotel. As the sun goes behind the hotel, the pools are completely shaded by about 3:30 and the beach by about 5:00 or 5:30, which can be good or bad - just be prepared. King beds are few - book early or call to see if any are available; the queen beds were so soft that I would roll toward my husband or he feared rolling off. Yes, I'll return because I love the location and convenience of all the amenities, but I'll keep staying during the shoulder/off seasons to get a better bang for the buck and may stay less often.

We've stayed here at least three or four times since they opened. The suites are well sized and we really love the large ocean front balcony. We also appreciated the topper that they put over the mattress on the sofabed. It made it much more comfortable for my kids to sleep on. The two oceanfront pools are great. They also have a large indoor pool and a nice game room. We split our time between the pools and the beach. Honestly, you don't need to leave the hotel for much. We had lunch poolside and then walked down to the boardwalk one night. It's an easy walk to the end of the boardwalk (less than 10 minutes) and then you can catch the tram if you don't want to continue walking. Alll of the staff were very friendly and attentive. I called several times for extra pillows and towels and they brought them right up. I also called to have someone come fix the squeaky door to the bedroom and again the maintenance staff came up within 10 minutes to take care of it. I noticed that someone in an earlier review mentioned slow housekeeping staff and having to wait until late in the day to have their room cleaned. I prefer an early cleaning so I can use the room later in the day, therefore each morning I simply called the front desk and requested a morning cleaning. The staff was very accomodating and my room was cleaned by noon. Quite honestly, that is the type of service one would expect when paying top dollar for a hotel room and I feel that I got it at the HIlton. There were just a few negatives that I think the management is probably aware of at this point, but I want to mention them. As nice at the property is, the hotel rooms are getting to the point that they need some refurbishment. Some of the furniture in the room was dinged up quite a bit from several years of use and the beds were much too soft. I think it's time that the mattresses be replaced because they are past their prime. The table on the balcony also had a broken table top. I also agree with other reviewers that the shower/tub is difficult to get in and out of because the sides are so high. I could do without the tub (which I never use in hotels) and go with a nice shower. I think that most people who stay here know that it is a pricey property and are willing to pay the price if the amenities and condition of the property are there to support it.

Both nights this weekend we went up between 4 and 5 and the room still wasnt clean. I had to walk down and interrupt the cleaning service and ask her for fresh towels. I find this unnaceptable for a major hotel chain in a prime location like this. How hard is it to get rooms clean and towels refreshed by early afternoon? Secondly, the WiFi is non-existant in a lot of areas, especially the bedroom. I gave up on trying to check my email about halfway through this stay due to the lousy WiFi reception. I know it's free, but I guess you get what you pay for in some cases. Finally, the parking here is a mess. This weekend was the Ocean City airshow, so of course people go out of there way to park as close to the beach as possible. the Hilton has free parking and doesn't do much in the way of policing their garage and main parking lot.

Again, rooms are comfortably furnished with nice bedding but not worthy of a 4-star rating. This is typical beach-front hotel property. We were fortunate that the weather cooperated and the children's pool was open. It was quite nice with two lifeguards, water features and well-behaved children. The beach is beautiful and well-groomed. The greatest feature of the hotel is the oceanfront location and the ability to take the children to the beach and back to the room easily when naps are needed (both for the adults and children). Housekeeping service was probably the biggest disappointment of our stay. Minimal cleaning was provided-i.e. no wet mopping of dirty kitchen or bathroom floors, no changing of dirty linens (even though a note was left to make sure to change the linens, they just ignored it and re-made the bed). On the second day, we had to call three times to request that housekeeping staff clean our room over a 1/2 day period. When she arrived with a surly attitude, I mentioned the need to change the dirty linens and mop the dirty floor (and provided a tip). Unfortunately, when we returned later in the day, the dirty linens were not changed and she just re-made the bed, but floor was mopped. I decided not to pursue further given the negative impact it was having on our visit and the uncaring attitude of front desk/guest services personnel. Overall, we had never been to Ocean City before and it was a pleasant surprise in terms of its family-oriented atmosphere and cleanliness. We chose this hotel because of its ratings on Tripadvisor and AAA. It is probably one of the better hotels in the area but is lacking in front desk customer service and professionalism as a Hilton brand, in addition to minimal housekeeping services. Since we stayed here during mid-week and off-season, we secured a reasonable rate. However, I don't think I would pay the asking price for in-season rates. This hotel is just an \"o.k.\" beachfront property, very clean, but nothing special and certainly not even close to luxurious or upscale.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great place!\u201d", "Author": "vandpstewart", "ReviewID": "UR129770091", "Content": "We took our 2 grandchildren here (3 and 6) and had a really terrific time.

My husband and I usually stay at Courtyard by Marriott because he has a bad back and the Courtyards (if renovated in the past 2-4 years) have decent beds that do not aggravate him. We go to the ocean annually at the end of October to celebrate our anniversary and we decided to visit O.C. this trip as my daughter is very pregnant and it is the closest drive in case we needed to be with her sooner than expected. So, we made a reservation at Courtyard a while back. Courtyard's rate for Fri & Sat night was (is) $199.00 + taxes, then, on weeknights other than Friday, $149.00. About three weeks ago a friend mentioned check Hilton for off-season, so we did and were pleasantly surprised to find the rate was $144/00/night all through the week. We contacted them and were able to make a reservation for a 2 Queen suite (i is ALL suites)...we were a little apprehensive about the beds but they seemed to be rated as comfortable. Additionally, this is the #1 rated hotel in O.C. here on TripAdvisor. I was delighted to read that there was a basic full kitchen and jetted bathtub, too. Service was excellent throughout our stay - bell service was pleasant coining and going; front desk staff were polite and courteous (and welcoming)). There is a concierge with good advice (by room phone or lobby desk). The kitchen is equipped with nice basic dishware. I broke a mug making coffee (oh - best in-room coffee to make - caff & decaf - ever) and called for housekeeping and a young lady arrived virtually immediately and cleaned very thoroughly and had a great attitude. Although all he king bed suites were taken, the hotel was not full and they accommodated our upon-arrival request to be near the elevator (my husband can walk but not far at times and weather was very cold so he was stiff & sore). There was a full fridge, microwave, blender, dishwasher, 4-cup coffee-maker and electric stove/oven. There were some wine glasses and a wine opener! We brought ours but nice to know for next time.; It's equipped for a family stay...we used the coffeemaker and microwave and fridge (we had leftovers at two restaurants and happy to have a fridge to keep them in nicely. They provide quality shampoo, conditioner, soaps, (body massage bar & facial), shower caps, etc. The shower is within the jetted bath (large) and is overhead (comes don like rain). There is a double sink (love that) and all as sparkling clean. Lots of thick towels,plus two thck robes in top of the closet should you need them, etc. The balcony is large than average and a nice round patio table with 4 decent patio chairs fits nicely on it. In nice weather it would be a lovely place to at breakfast - the sun rises directly in front of the shore, so I did get up two mornings to photograph the sunrise and drank coffee out there ... There is a small living room upon entry and it has a nice LG TV (32\" or little more?) as does the bedroom. The wi-fi (free) is strong ... The beds are lovely; firm with some bounce - about equivalent to the ones we like at Courtyard, so we slept excellently. The only thing bad I have to say is the breakfast we tried one morning was so awful (and they handled that so we did not pay for it) and I do not hold that against them as far as rating them on the hotel accommodations - there are quite a few decent breakfast places, so that was not a big deal in the end....stay here, especially off-season, and eat elsewhere.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cOff-season Winner\u201d", "Author": "Decklid18", "ReviewID": "UR119960572", "Content": "After futzing with various hotel booking sites, I asked a friend for a recommendation for our Ocean City stay.

It's a nice way to turn a 7 day vacation into a 10 day one, and as nice as the condo we stay at may be, it's not the same as staying in a nice hotel with all the amenities that a hotel can offer. This time we were upgraded to a King Corner Suite. I had alwasys thought that all the rooms were the same, but the king corner suite was amazing and much bigger than the regular suite. We had plenty of room for a roll away bed along with the pull out sofa in the living room. My kids do not like to share a bed so this was great. The full kitchen is really nice as you have the option of making breakfast and lunch in the room if you want. The kitchens have a pretty respectable offering of appliances, pots and pans, plates, etc. We choose to go out for dinners, but if a family wanted to eat in, that would be easy to do. As always, the service was great from the front desk staff and the bellhops to the servers and bartenders at the pool. Everybody is always so friendly and accomodating and really do make the guests feel like they are on vacation. This year my kids did not want to participate in the arts and crafts program or watch the movie as they preferred to stay on the beach, but we have taken advantage of these in the past, and when they were younger, it was a great \"kid free\" break for us. Another really great service that the Hilton provides is changing rooms for use on the day of checkout. Not only are guests allowed to use the facilities on their day of checkout, but they are given access keys to a changing room with showers, which makes staying and enjoying your last day to the fullest so nice; something that is very important on a beach trip.

I read many reviews before going here and this place definitley was as good as many people have said. The rooms were very clean and the beds were some of the best I have ever slept in at a hotel. The only complaint I would have is that the wireless internet signal was a little weak and did not work on the balcony from my tenth floor room. I took the advice of many reviewers and stayed above the 6th floor because I had a baby and was worried about noise. This was a good choice especially since we left the balcony door open all day and the noise from the pool could be loud. At night we could here the ocean waves which was very relaxing. All the rooms face the ocean at this place. What impressed me most was how soundproof the room was. Even the balcony doors were very soundproof once closed. I used the gym at this place and it was adequate with an extensive dumbell set, two benches, physio and medicine balls and a varitey of Cardio equipment to include three treadmills, two eliptical machines and a stationary bike. All the cardio equipment had personal screens to watch TV, just bring a set of headphones as it appears they only have two in the gym. The three pools were also great. The kiddie pool gets crowded quickly. I saw one parent from my balcony walk to the pool by herself at 8am, place 8 items on 8 chairs and walked away. People do this as chairs run out and they have nowhere to sit when they come to the pool. This is annoying but understandable when you are traveling with small kids but taking 8 chairs and leaving seemed wrong. This hotel is expensive but if money is not a problem it is the way to go. We went here as we had an infant and it was right on the beach with a full kitchen. It was convineient and if the baby was a problem or needed to be changed by my wife or myself we could simply walk back to the room while leaving the rest of the family at the beach. I saw one poster complain about the distance to the beach and the long staircase that leads to the beach. This person must be either really out of shape or elderly as the stair case is not as bad as they describe. It could be difficult if you have a few small kids and many things to carry but this could be solved by taking the elevator to the ground floor and taking the sidewalk around the block to the beach, avoiding all staircases. Another poster described a bellhop named Val who was very friendly and helpful. We met him on our arrival and I noticed his nametag. This guy lived up to the bill and was very friendly and actually played with and talked to my kids whenever he saw us. I told him about tripadvisor and the post which he later read, He was so happy about it and thanked me the next day for telling him about it.

The lifeguards and hotel staff do thier best to keep order, but a sandy, wet kid running through the lobby is the fault of the parent. Then again I saw plenty of adults doing that as well. At night things do quiet down as pools close early. If you are looking for a nice quiet stay, wait til the kids go back to school. Having a 7 year old,we are used to this so it was no big deal. We found the location to be perfect - about a 4 block walk to the end of the boardwalk where you can jump on the tram - (keep in mind all the rides and games on the boardwalk are about 35 blocks away).

It rained a few times when we were there - but the Hilton provided indoor activities twice a day for children 5 and up - crafts, cooking, movies - you just needed to sign up in time. Also had an indoor pool. Our favorite pools, weather permitting, were the outdoor pools - the kids pool and the (non-kids) pool - the pools were one floor above the ground & you could set up the hotels lounge chairs for beach views. I would recommend bringing a cooler and some food from home (or from along the way) to cook with (except for the times you wish to splurge on some seafood) - the hilton has a good kitchen - full side fridge, range - microwave & pots/pans, utensils (and dishwasher!). Wish sofa bed were more comfortable - next time will likely get 2 Queens (instead of one King) so the kids can have a nice best to rest on. Kids LOVED the beach & we were only a short distance from boardwalk (which didn't seem that great for small kids anyhow - except for the playground sets on the beach) - and also we were across the street from an amusement park that my kids had a blast on at night.

Ate dinner at the restaurant one night-it was 'empty' except for a couple of celebrations, it was ok, abit pricey for the quality, but the staff were all very good. The 2 pools (adult w/swim up bar & kids' slides) were separated by a walkway, both gated w/attendants to check wristband (black rubber bands w/Hilton Suites stamped), then you had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the beach.

Beach was lit up at night and the oceanfront balcony was very comfortable w/2 chairs & regular height glass table. Newspapers delivered weekdays. What a life, drinking your AM coffee, reading the papers by the ocean in your PJ's! Took the public bus to the tip of the boardwalk, then one short block to the boardwalk. Saw entertainment along the way, eateries and lil shops. Ripleys is on the boardwalk. Beach volleyball & soccor matches, beautiful sand scultures and playgrounds were on the sand.

Hilton pretty much manages only two luxury oceanfront properties close to DC, the other one being in Virginia Beach (a much longer drive), and the HSOC is by far the best. I have never seen the Hilton Suites concept anywhere else but in Ocean City, and it is very convincing step up from what you get at an Embassy Suites. Amenities include a full kitchen and a suite where you can very comfortably entertain for 6 or more, including a dining room table. Our bathroom included an impressive jacuzi which was quite wonderful. The bedroom was charming, the poster-perfect picture of what a beach hotel room should be, with pastel colors, vacation-themed pictures, quality furniture and very comfortable bedding. Everything in the room expressed the owners' desire to provide quality products so you can in turn have an exceptional time in Ocean City. And of course, the best part: the view from a balcony the same length as the room itself. The balcony included a well-made table with glass top and four chairs, as well as a separation from the balconies next to you for total privacy. Cooking breakfast in the well-appointed kitchen and enjoy it while watching the endless ocean and listening to the waves was worth the price of the trip, and brought us to a state of relaxation that never departed us for the duration of the weekend. Staff was very friendly and unpretentious, and we felt that they went the extra mile in appreciation for our loyalty to the Hilton chain.

Many times during the night (seemed to follow a regular pattern), we would hear a rather loud, high-pitched groaning noise that would last for several seconds-- enough to wake people up, although two of our three children slept through it. The maintenance guy told us this noise was from the \"chillers\" (related to the a/c) and nothing could be done except change rooms (he said the noise was only a problem on the \"adult pool\" side where we were). Even though I am a gold member and regularly asked the front desk, evidently due to the peak season, upgrades were not generally available. (The other problem with the first floor is there is only a limited view of the ocean). They did offer me lunch vouchers for the last day to help make up for the noisy location, but we would have much preferred a quiet room.

The hotel is all suites so you have a living room and dining table, kitchen, large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub/shower and double sinks, separate bedroom with a great balcony.

The room temperature does not go below 65 degrees and for most people that is cold enough but my fiance has a medical condition that he has to have it colder. During several stays the management was able to come up and override the temperature and make it cooler but after those couple of times we were told they are not able to do that and actually got quite nasty about it. Also, between late June and early September the rates are extremely high! I just recently checked for a weeknight stay in August and it was over $500 a night! The hotel is nice but not worth $500 a night!

One outdoor pool with kids' activities: fountains, long slide, running river with no tubes, tepid jacuzzi. Other outdoor pool billed as adult is NOT adult: Kids in pool. Pool bar drinks splashed with pool water by ball-throwing tikes. The beautiful atrium indoor pool is perfect for lap swimming. Rent chaise lounges and umbrellas on the beach or bring your own gear. Parking is close to the beach. The boardwalk is 5 blocks away.

It is by far the priciest of the hotels along the beach front strip. It cost my family $500/night not including taxes. The view from the room is tremendous, but I was dismayed by the frayed furniture throughout the hotel room and the hotel as well. The game room sucked - a tiny room with about 10 games for the kids - half of which were broken. I would think that a hotel that got 4 stars and is supposed to be fairly new would look better. The staff was all young and not at all polished and the food at the brunch was awful - not even close to being 4 star food. Luckily we only ate at the hotel restaurant once so we did not suffer too much. The location is wonderful with a Jolly Rogers theme park right across the street - boardwalk is just a few blocks from the hotel, but you must know that the really active part of the boardwalk is a good 30 blocks down. It's a pleasant walk and we were able to do it even with two kids in tow. All in all I would give Hilton 2 1/2 stars, but not 4 - no way. The pool needed work, the food was awful and the staff, even though nice enough, were not 4 star polished.

Saw pictures of the pool on Hilton's website and figured it looked pretty decent and was worth a shot, especially since the Hotel seemed to be sold out on almost every weekend and it was listed as the top most category 7 on Hilton's site . Booked the weekend of June 16 (Fri and Sat night). Stayed here using Hilton award certificates that I got for free as a promotion in Q4 2010 when I was on company travel so glad I didn't burn up my precious Hilton points as a Category 7 is 50K points a night. I know pictures always look more appealing but this was actually quite disappointing for a Category 7. I know it's right on the beach and in a popular town (even though it's about 30 blocks from the heart of the boardwalk), but a Category 7 rating for the Hotel itself is quite flattering (a 5 would be more appropriate) especially when you compare to the Hilton's of Hawaii (Waikoloa or Honolulu) that are of the same rating. Guess though all oceanfront properties have been upgraded to this category, but parts of the hotel should reflect the quality too. So here's the scoop Check-in -------------- - The girl that checked me in (maybe she was new) didn't really know how to handle my award reservation and called over the manager when I handed over my printed reward certificates. - Manager was actually quite nice. Didn't get an upgrade to a King suite (got two beds - was told they were Queen, but think they were fulls) but did get a room away from the elevator - One good thing as a Diamond member was that they gave all the perks - usually some hotels either give you bonus points or breakfast coupons or a room upgrade, but manager told me that they give all (since this was a reward stay I just wanted the breakfast). - Hotel has free internet which is a nice added benefit. Usually hotels like to stick you with a wifi charge, but thought this was decent though not sure how many people bring their laptops to Ocean City (but it is neat if you have an iPhone or similar smart phone that you can use) - Free water (a nice big Pellegrino) bottle along with a couple of small packets of Milano cookies comes to your room with the nightly turn down service Hotel pools ---------------- - There are actually three pools (a outdoor kiddie pool, an outdoor adult pool and an indoor family pool). The outdoor pools are actually on the 2nd floor (or 1st floor if you account for a ground floor which there is at the hotel, i.e. not at street level). Guessing this is to alleviate any risk of flooding and damage to the property since it's right on the beach. - Only went to the outdoor kiddie pool, but the adult pool has a swim up bar (nothing spectacular in terms of design/layout but just a lowered bar that is on the edge of one side of a rectangular pool). - The two outdoor pools are separated by a walkway that runs through and has stairs going down to the beach (there is a rudimentary hose there to wash yourself off before you come back up). There is also a rectangular hot tub on the far side of the kiddie pool. - Only the kiddie pool has somewhat of an imaginative design to it. There are also some fake palm trees to add some color but easy to make out they're fake since the tops are black. - There are two slides in the kiddie pool - a short one for the little ones and a bigger kind of curved \"L\" shaped white slide. The small side is nice for toddlers and while the bigger slide is more fun it probably needs to be upgraded as it looks a bit old and kind of sticks out (would be nicer if they had some hardscaping instead of just sticking out a piece of plastic tubing over the pool). - So while the kiddie pool has some design, it is usually always crowded since most people staying here bring their families. - Also there is a bit of a current going in a clockwise direction at the right end of the pool so if you have a little one be careful or you might find them getting pulled away towards the exit of the big slide! - My rating of the kiddie pool was 6/10. Basic enough but nothing special. Hotel Rooms ------------------- - Good thing about the rooms is that they are all suites with a separate albeit small living room with a couch and chair, a coffee table, a small round dining table and a separate TV, so it's big enough for a family of 4. - I expected the bedroom to be a bit bigger, but the other good thing about the rooms is that they are they are all ocean facing with a decent sized private balcony with a small round table and chairs overlooking the pool area . - Room includes a fully equipped kitchen with refrigerator, microwave, cooking range and dishware with pots and silverware if you're bringing food or get takeout - Bathroom is quite decent with two separate sinks and I believe they all have a jacuzzi which was fun for our 3 year old when it rained on one of the mornings. Wierd thing is that it is a jucuzzi/shower so you stand in the triangular jacuzzi if you need to take a shower which is firmly fixed to the ceiling and not very powerful (or warm) in my opinion - the hot/cold lever takes a little fiddling to get the temparature you need but I lost my patience and settled for what it would give me.

Restaurant ---------------- - Possibly one of the most disorganized hotel restaurants (esp for a Cat 7) that I've been to (only went for breakfast). - Used our free breakfast coupons (which was for continental breakfast worth $9 - i.e. breads, pastries, cereal), but upgraded to the full hot breakfast on the 1st day for an additional $10. Spread is standard and there is a made to order Omlette station with a lady that has her tip plate blatantly right out in front with likely some of her own cash - Beware though this restaurant has some really funny policies with regards to the breakfast to try to nickle and dime you. Apparently, if you get the full buffet ($20 if you're paying full price), juice is included but coffee/tea is not included (you have to pay for that separately)!!! But if you get the continental breakfast, which we did the 2nd day, it includes coffee/tea but not juice or fruit (again you have to pay for those separately), which I declined since I was irked - They also have a bunch of foreign summer students working at the hotel restaurant and not professional employees so things were forgotten at times and staff had to be reminded more than once. Not to mention they are not properly organized so half the time they are scurrying around and don't get to your table for a while. - Seriously think the catering/restaurant needs an overhaul .. might just have to put a call into Hilton (but don't think anything will happen since this location is a franchisee) Check-out -------------- - Check out is at 11am, though hotels have a tendency of pushing the checkout time up in busy places such as this, even if they're not full. Even so they really give you an extra hour (i.e. until 12) to give people enough time to checkout (was told they keys would work until 12). - So when asked for a late checkout they politely turned down due to the above reason that they are full (which I think was the standard response even though I could tell they were not). - However the plus is that they let you use the facilities, including the pool after you check out and was offered the use of a common changing room/shower on their main floor (which actually looked quite decent even though we didn't get to use it due to the weather and instead headed out to the boardwalk) - Other good thing is that parking at the hotel is free. Was a pleasant surprise given how crowded OC gets. In addition to the outdoor parking lot surrounding the hotel, they have a single storey covered garage at the back (both of which get full by late evening), and in fact even have an additional overflow uncovered lot across the street solely for hotel guests. All in all the experience was ok. Only reason we came was for the pool for our little one, that it was a 3 hour drive from where we live in Jersey, and I had some free stay certificates. Likely won't stay here in the near future unless I get some certificates again (if I had to use points or cash would rather find a bargain airfare to Florida and go camp at the Embassy Suites Deerfield Beach that has a better feel to it even if it does only have one outdoor pool)!", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampstead, MD", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, would definitely stay there again\u201d", "Author": "sladerer", "ReviewID": "UR114581740", "Content": "Stayed over Father's Day weekend.

It would have been nice to be contacted about this as Friday night was in an accessible room and our Sat/Sun reservation was not, but the intent and consideration was appreciated. The hotel was clean, bright and well maintained. Two outdoor pools between the lobby and the beach were very clean. The hot tub could have been a little warmer but it was a cooler/overcast day and it would have been nice if the pool bar had reopened after the rain stopped. The kids enjoyed the game room. The lobby was very open with a coffee/danish stand. All staff we interacted with were professional and friendly.

What matters is how a hotel deals with those imperfections -- and how you deal with them yourself. This trip was our second to Ocean City, and our second to this Hilton. Last year, we arrived to find the room we requested not available. After a bit of waiting, the on-duty manager went above and beyond to compensate us, not only juggling things so that we could get the room we requested, but also compensating us with free breakfast for the length of our stay. After service like that, the Hilton was atop our list when we returned to OC this year. (We came slightly later this time, to see if we could find the sweet spot where the temps are warm and most businesses are open, but the crowds still haven't arrived. Alas, the first week of May isn't it. The weather was spotty and many establishments were still shuttered. Next time we'll aim for the middle of May. Anyway...) We checked in quickly and found the room -- a Terrace Suite on the top floor of the hotel -- exactly as we'd hoped: clean, available, and with everything apparently in working order. We dashed off to Anthony's on the corner to pick up beer and wine before my wife's parents arrived to join us for the one evening, had an utterly awful meal down by the Inlet (Harrison's Harbor Watch...no thanks) and came back to turn in for the night. That's when we discovered the first problem: The outdoor jacuzzi, which is the main thing that differentiates the Terrace Suites from the standard room, was nonfunctional. I called down to the desk immediately, and they assured us they'd send someone up in the morning to take care of it. (It was late enough that we wouldn't have wanted to wait up for maintenance anyway.) Unfortunately, the next morning we discovered problem number two: The water in our room didn't work. At all. Called down to the desk again and was informed by a very apologetic staff member that a water pump in the building had failed and they were working on it. Within an hour or so the water was back -- the only trouble was, due to the delay in not being able to shower, we had missed the window for breakfast at the in-house restaurant. Now, here's the thing about stuff like this: It happens. No hotel can keep a perfect eye on the functionality of every item in the room, and no hotel can predict something like a pump failure. The important thing is what they do about it. And what they did about it was absolutely perfect. My father-in-law spoke briefly with the manager, who immediately gave us a $70 credit (the difference between the Terrace Suite and the regular room) and gave my in-laws a $50 credit to compensate us all for having missed breakfast. And by the time we came back to our room that afternoon, the hot tub was working perfectly. This is service. And all it took was a polite (that is the key word, though: *polite*) statement of the situation and a reasonable request for compensation. Of course, the best service in the world probably wouldn't have drawn us back if the hotel itself weren't excellent. But it is: The rooms are spotless, the views spectacular. The in-suite kitchens are fully equipped. (Full plateware and servingware, pots and pans, microwave, range, oven, dishwasher, blender, small coffee maker -- though bring your own filters if you want something other than the mediocre house pouches -- wine glasses, cutting board. Pretty much everything. Oh, except ice trays; bring your own or plan to buy or fetch ice.) The location is great if you want to be near -- but not on -- the bustle of the boardwalk. Sure, there could be more quality restaurants and bars in walking distance. Sure, the outdoor furniture could be of better quality. But there's really very little worth complaining about with this fine establishment. One note about rooms, though: Rooms on the 4th floor and below get both light and noise from the pool area; if you're looking forward to gazing at the stars and listening to the waves, ask for a higher floor. Also, the Corner Suites (where we stayed last year) are excellent, but avoid the ones on the north end of the hotel; they look out to an ugly property next door, while the south-facing rooms offer a much nicer view. And finally, about the Terrace Suite itself, I would definitely stay there again. However, be aware that the room itself is no bigger than the regular rooms; you're paying extra for the open terrace that adjoins your balcony -- and the jacuzzi, of course. (Which, in case you're wondering, is screened but not completely private due to points-of-view from the hotel and floors above.) That may not sound like much, but the addition of lounge chairs and sunshine made the room even more comfortable than the Corner Suites. Do note that these rooms also face north, but since they start on the 6th floor (possibly higher), the ugly hotel next door is much less of a problem. Still, I'd recommend asking for as high a floor as you can get. Finally, a few notes about dining options in the immediate area: First, room service: Though all we've had was breakfast, it's been excellent every time -- far above what I've come to expect from room-service breakfast, at a shockingly low $9.50 for the full \"American.\" As mentioned, Anthony's is a great place for beer and wine (found a rare favorite wine of ours there!) and also offers deli sandwiches, deli meats and a fair selection of cheeses if you're looking for something to go with your wines. In the same plaza as Anthony's is OC Wasabi, a small but excellent sushi restaurant. We've dined there twice now and both meals were quite good -- not the best sushi I've ever had, but reasonably priced and quite authentic. South a bit on the main drag is Coins Pub and Mother's Cantina. We found both of these to be satisfying for what they were, but nothing remotely exceptional. Similar sentiments can be said for Happy Jack Pancake House, just a bit south of the above. The pancakes were somewhat above average, but everything else was entirely mediocre. A short drive north is Horizons at the Clarion, which was, in a word, gross. Not the food -- the food was fine...or at least it was after I sent back my inedible hockey puck filet and its accompanying slimy lobster tail. (To be clear and to be fair, the replacements were really quite excellent, and my wife enjoyed most of her meal.) But the place was simply disgustingly dirty, and I'm not the type to normally notice such things. We sat by the window, which should have been a great view over the ocean, but instead I found myself distracted by splatters of what I fervently hope was Alfredo sauce covering a good portion of the floor-to-ceiling window. Ew. One other dining note: Closer to the hotel but still north is Reflections, which is a charmingly over-the-top fine-dining place festooned with brick, brass, and statuary. Expensive, but worth it if you want to have a special night out like they did in the mid-'80s. Great food, solid wine list, and just a great ambiance. And I believe I've gone on for long enough. tl;dr: Hilton good. Location good.

I advised the front desk clerk I had changed my reservation to one night for Saturday. The clerk said their system did not show this change. I asked to speak to the manager and explained what happened. She told me unless I could provide \"proof\" of the change, she could not make any changes as they had a two night minimum. I asked to speak to her corporate office and she handed me a card with an 800 number on it. It took me over an hour to get to the right person--a Ms Celeste Willis--who saw that my reservation should have been changed but was not. She then spent an hour on the phone with the manager of the hotel getting her to credit me back for one night's stay. The manager was rude and did nothing to confirm my story, It took her a very long time to adjust my account. All in all we spent several hours of our vacation handling what was Hilton's mistake. After the manager knew it was their mistake she did not do anything to make things better for me. Offering a free drink in the bar would have been nice or a free coffee at Starbucks in the lobby would have been appropriate. I lost several hours of my vacation time while standing at the front desk waiting for the manager to make the appropriate adjustments to my bill.

We usually stay at our family shared condo, but decided we wanted to enjoy the amenities that the Hilton has to offer. As we entered the lobby we were very impressed by how clean, and fresh smelling the hotel was. Check- in was quick and easy, and it was wonderful to have a friendly bellman load up and take our luggage to our room. All of the Hilton's rooms are ocean front, and we had a lovely suite on the 10th floor. Our room was spotlessly clean (and I'm very picky). The balcony and our view of the ocean was amazing! The room had a fully equipt kitchen and the bathroom had double sinks and a very nice make-up mirror. It also featured a corner Jacuzzi tub with a rain shower. The tub was large enough for two. The tub could be problematic for some as the sides are rather tall (I'm short!) and would it probably be difficult for an elderly or shorter person to get in and out of. Another problem with the tub is that the bottom of it was rather slippery when using the shower feature. I stood on a towel while showering to prevent slipping. The bedroom area was decorated beautifully and there was a great view of the ocean from the bed. The beds are very warm with both a down pillow-top mattress cover and a down comforter. If you are a person who \"runs hot\" you might be a litte too warm in bed. The mattresses are of medium firmness and we slept very well. The rooms are also extremely quiet. The hotel was fully booked and we didn't hear noise from anyone all weekend. Because it was the off season, many of the restaurants in Ocean City were closed for the season. Our first night there we ate at The Embers, a buffet-style restaurant. Both of our mornings at the Hilton we ordered room service breakfast. The food was wonderful and the portions were plentiful. Although the hotel was fully booked, I don't think we waited more than 20 minutes for our food. We also had room service for dinner on our second night and it was equally as wonderful. The indoor pool is another nice feature at the hotel. It is fairly large with a nice lounge chair area. There is even a window where you can order drinks from the bar. This hotel is very kid friendly, so there were lots of children in the pool, but they were all very well behaved. The staff at the Hilton is super-friendly and well trained in hospitality. It was truly a fabulous weekend! For first time travelers: The outlets that are just before the south bridge are nice, but rather small. Drive on to Rehoboth to the Tanger Outlets there, if you enjoy outlet shopping. Also, while in Rehoboth eat a Jake's Seafood House.

I have been a Hilton Diamond member for 5 years and have been hoping to find some time to stay at this place as we are only a couple hours drive away. I like to do most reviews by doing PRO/CON comparisons. But this hotel didn't have much to complain about. Anyway, here goes: PROs Free Parking - You just don't find that at many Hilton brands anymore. I travel a ton for work and Hiltons always charged $10-$25 a night to park (even higher in NYC) Full Kitchen - All suites are set up like Embassy Suites with separate bedroom and living area, however the suites here come with full sized refrigerator, full sized oven and 4-burner range, microwave, toaster, blender, pots, pans, dishes, silverware. Pools/water park - we are here in the fall so pools outside and water park are drained, but they have a huge indoor heated pool which the kids loved hitting each night before bed. Also have full sized beach towel type towels available in the pool area. And did I mention that the bar has a window service at the indoor pool area? Perfect design all the way around. Jet tub/shower - loved the huge jet tub/shower and double sink bathroom. With a family of 4 the huge bathroom makes a difference! Balcony w/table and chairs - how cool is it to have a balcony with table and chairs overlooking the Atlantic. Oceanfront location - no crossing streets and no boardwalk to contend with. The hotel is literally on the beach. Flat screen TV's - not only do they have flatscreens in the br and living area, but they are wall mounted and have the on-demand movie and game channels. Our room also had a DVD player. Next time we will bring DVD's. Guest laundry - big laundry room on every floor and free to guests. Starbucks - yes!! a Starbucks right by the front desk. We brought coffee and filters and used the pot in the room one morning but it was nice to have Starbucks there for an evening latte. CONs Breakfast - breakfast buffet is expensive, and Diamonds are not comped here but then again with a full sized kitchen and all the appliances, we made breakfast ourselves.

It could just been that we came at the end of summer, when in previous years we visited in June. One thing that ticked me off was the lack of supervision on the small slide, so easy for a kid to fall off. Kids were going up the wrong way, pushing on top, surprised no one got hurt. Not really the lifeguards fault, the parents of the kids could care less. Good 6' drop from the top of the slide right onto concrete. We went to the usual places to eat (Dumsers, Thrashers, Fishers).

Hilton would be a nice place to do a quick three day beach trip without having to rent a home for an entire week. With what amounts to $600 per day, you would think that you would get 4-star service all the way around. There were a few bright spots, but after only two days here I must say that I am very disappointed and sorry we didn't travel to the Outer Banks and take a partial week vacation. We booked a Corner Suite online. When we arrived at our room, we found out we were just one floor above the bar area complete with bar noise and view of the bar's roof. After having to wait until right at 3 PM to get our room (which happened to be the actual check in time, but isn't it nice when your room is ready for early check-in?....not in our case!) we were reluctant to move, but knew we had to. The problem is, there are only 5 double queen corner suites and I believe that many kings on the other side of the hotel. That fact greatly limits your ability to move into a like room on a different floor. We transferred to a \"regular\" queen suite which actually saved us $50 per night. Without going into needless detail, I think what you will find here is a lovely hotel for the most part, but simply not worth the money. It was peak season when we stayed, which makes everything crowded, almost laughably so at times. The beaches at Ocean City are so packed and noisy, at it is not relaxing for one liek myself looking for a \"quiet vacation\". The children seem to love it though and that's really the only reason to come here. Both doors in our room rubbed on the upper side which seemed to result from poor installation. The jacuzzi in our bathroom was difficult to start, and I found it wasn't blowing bubbles because the adjustment knob was broken. When I told them about it, the desk said they would tell maintenance. I have yet to see anyone come up. Very surprising given the service and quality you pay for here. It rained for about two hours this morning so seemingly everyone piled into the indoor pool. It was surprisingly chilly, more suited for exercise swimming than playing with your children in it. The outdoor bar never reopened despite the pool reopening after it stopped raining. We used the fold-out bed in the \"living room\", but found it not to have any sheets. There were none in the closet either. After we asked the desk to bring some up, they replied, \"Check again.\" None magically appeared. After quite some time, a staff member brought some up. Somehow like we were asking for a big favor or something. In general the clientele are more upscale than you typically see in OC. They are also sometimes rude. Men striding through the lobby in nothing but skimpy bathing suits is not uncommon here. I will say the ocean views from the 7th floor (and I'm sure above) are lovely, as is the constant sound of the surf. Things actually do quiet down after about 9 PM. The boardwalk is only 4 blocks away. The cleaning girls (some Hispanic, some eastern European) were pleasant and efficient. We had a very nice breakfast at the hotel and our waiter (from Cameroon!) was very nice. My eldest daughter seemed to enjoy the arts and crafts which I believe runs for a few hours evey afternoon. A couple of hints: if renting bikes, try the place on 20th street, not 27th. As the boardwalk ends on 27th, every Tom, Dick, and Harry north of there hits up the place on 27th. They had surprisingly fewer bikes when we fell into the same trap. The concierge seemed very nice and knowledgeable. If thinking of dining in, try the 32 Palm restaurant but order directly from the hostess and have her call your room when it is ready. You'll save a bundle on room service charges, have a better selection, and tipping would be optional not expected.

It's not spotless like a business hotel in a downtown area, but its very clean for a hotel filled with kids coming and going to the beach. This property is very much geared towards families who want easy access to the beach.

This is our second year at the property and its a great hotel. We look forward to coming back. As mentioned in the title we were traveling with a 2 year old and 2 month old so keep that in mind when reading my review. The Pro's Suites Hotel - you have a kitchen, living room, and bedroom. The kitchen is fully stocked with microwave, blender, full size refrigerator, wine glasses, toaster, etc. The hotel provides diswasher detergent and dish detergent. There are also laundry areas on every floor which are free. Location - you are located right on the beach. Its about 5 blocks from the boardwalk but its the quiet end of the boardwalk which is 3 miles long. We drove to the end where there is more action in terms of amusements and restaurants. Pools - hotel has an indoor pool, kiddie pool with lifeguard and slides, family pool with swim up bar. It was open until 8 pm daily. Around 7 pm the hotel shades the pool and the beach. This was a great time to bring our 2 month old out to see everything. Room Service - Great! We ordered a lot. Ask about the specials. View - all rooms have an ocean view. Starbucks - is located in the lobby in season. They also sell popsicles. Parking - We parked right at the hotel. There is also an overflow lot down the street which is a block away. Con's - Very minor Trash Cans - the size of the bathroom trashcan is super small and the kitchen can is also small. We brought extra trash bags/ziploc bags for all the diapers. Remote Controls - the tv remote controls need replacing. The up down buttoms are worn out and need to be pushed hard to work the tv. No Spa - It would be nice if it had a spa onsite. Key cards - We both deactived our key cards. In one instance I had to go to the front desk twice in order to get into the room. We have both traveled a lot for work and have never had this issue before. Can be Pricey - We were using points but the hotel can be pricey in season. We had talked about next year renting a house but we feel the Hilton offers a lot that houses can't (pools, arcade, room service, location on beach, etc). Other Items: During our stay we also ate Papa John's Pizza - 2 blocks from the hotel but they will deliver. Also Bagels n Buns for breakfest which had good bagel sandwiches and delivered if you spent over $25. Fish Tales at 22nd and bay was very casual open air restaurant. There is a shaded indoor portion. Fish tales also has a pirate ship children could play in. It seemed to be for kids 3 +. McDonalds is also located 2 blocks from the hotel. There is also a store called Anthony's which sells beer/wine but also sells milk. As we were traveling with a 2 year old and 2 month old we brought our own pack n play, outlet safety covers, extra trash bags since small trash cans, ziplocs for dirty diapers, boppy pillow, some dreft detergent for laundry. We also noticed a lot of children had swim vests on in the kiddie pool.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Allentown (PA)", "Title": "\u201cThis is a high quality \u201cresort\u201d, not a typical \u201cshore\u201d hotel\u201d", "Author": "bbmss", "ReviewID": "UR72715678", "Content": "I have stayed several times before at the Hilton Suites in Ocean City (MD).

You pay for it \u2013 summer rates are $500 per night (but I paid using Hilton rewards certificates). All the rooms are ocean front (directly oceanfront, not ocean view on the side) suites: living room with pull out sofabed, small full kitchen (full size refrigerator, sink, micro, range), one full bath generous size, and bedroom (two queens or king). There are two outdoor pools: one children\u2019s (slide, mini-lazy river, sprayers) and an adult pool in a separate area with nice swim-up pool bar. A separate bar & food service area is adjacent to the adult pool. There is also a hot tub in the children\u2019s pool area. Inside is a nice sized indoor pool (but the water was cold), small arcade room, and gym. The lobby has small sundry store and a quick service snack bar (drinks, fruit, pastries, ice cream). A full service restaurant and bar is also inside. There is a children\u2019s activity room with daily afternoon arts & crafts project and a movie at night. Breakfast room service was very good (food & service). You walk out directly onto the beach where rental umbrellas are readily available. Parking was adequate \u2013 I always found a spot. Overall, it is very clean, well maintained, and in great physical condition. The location is ideal: oceanfront (not on the boardwalk), but a short drive to the boardwalk and everything else in Ocean City. You are within walking distance to liquor store, a few restaurants, mini-golf, and Jolly Roger amusement park.

We had never stayed at the Hilton before, but from pictures & reviews it seemed like a great place. My mother took care of the accomodations (mom's treat!), so I cannot say if the value was equivalent to what we expected and received, but I will say it was a wonderful place to stay, and my mother was very pleased! We had 5 people in our party total - varying in ages from 55 to 17 years old and stayed for 4 nights. The hotel and location was accomodating for all of us. I am 6 months pregnant, so I really wanted to \"just relax\" and thats exactly what I did. The pool and beach are steps away, and the views from the balcony are serene. You can rent beach chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards on the beach as well. We ate at the hotel restaurant \"the palms\"... it was average fare but pricey. I found it difficult to select something on the menu and ended up ordering chicken tenders from the kid's menu. Others in our party were not very satisfied with their meals. We also ate lunch at the pool grill... it was average as well. One thing I wish I had done prior to the trip was research places to eat. We ate out every night but never really had a satisfying meal. I am not very much into crab legs or rockfish so I probably should have done some homework beforehand. We tried 2x to eat at the Greene Turtle but unless you get there by 4:00pm, forget it. They have at least a 1-2 hour wait every night after 4pm. My favorite dining experience was lunch at Seacrets. What a neat place! I would suggest going to Seacrets during the day if you are not into the nightclub scene, just to see the place... it is crazy! I hear it's a lot of fun at night as well. The hotel is approx 2 blocks from the boardwalk - an easy walk. The boardwalk is fun for all ages and gets a bit more crowded at night. We walked the length of the boardwalk and would then take the trolley all the way back. I would not want to stay in a hotel on the boardwalk. The hilton is in a perfect location. Regarding the room - it was spacious, modern and luxurious... just what i was hoping/expecting. I will say that if you are traveling alone or with a spouse and are looking for a \"break from your kids\" or don't like to be around children, I would not stay at this hotel. It is very children-oriented. They have a children's pool (play land) and an \"adult pool\" (I guess you could say it's \"adult\" mainly because it gets deep), but children play in the \"adult pool\" as well. Twice during our stay the children's pool was shut down for the day for cleaning because of someone getting sick in the pool, which meant ALL of the children and their families came into the adult pool. The children were doing flips, jumps, etc into the pool, literally taking over, with no regard for the adults who were enjoying the swim-up bar, sunbathing, reading, etc. The lifeguards did not seem to care. It was not a BIG deal, but if I were there to enjoy time away from children and to have a few drinks at the swim-up bar I don't think I would have appreciated getting splashed, kicked, etc. Also many people were very territorial over reserving lounge chairs. This happens at hotels everywhere, but a few people were obnoxious about it. By 2pm there would be single wet towels all over chairs to the point where you didn't know if chairs were actually taken or not. I guess that can't be avoided. Also, by mid-afternoon the clean beach towel supply was usually out. All very minor things though. Service was excellent and staff was very warm and friendly - from the bell-hop, to the reservation desk to the maid service, they all contributed to a very positive vacation. All in all it was an excellent, enjoyable vacation.

THe sofa bed needs to be refurbish since now you can feel every spring and it makes for an uncomfortable night sleep. The beds sleep well but the pillows are a TRAVESTY.

And we were also able to make our dinner reservations right there/ on the spot (which was also included in the Romance Package). Loved the suite. We ended up having to get a double queen as that was all that was left but didn't bother us much. The layout is really what I really liked. The sitting room, and then the fully stocked kitchen, the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, and then the room and the balcony facing perfect ocean view. Flat screens in both the sitting and bedroom areas of the suite. The kitchen is fully stocked and all of the utensils, silverware, glassware, pots and pans, appliances and the like are very clean and it great condition. Dinner was one of the best parts which was also included (full/ 3 courses). I wasn't expecting much from the hotel restaurant but was pleasantly SURPRISED. We started w/ the lobster bisque it was very rich and creamy, great flavor. He had the crabcakes which were okay. And I had the stuffed rockfish which was topped w/ some type of hollandaise or imperial sauce. It was very good, baked tender but to a golden brown, fresh full of flavor and very filling. For desert my husband had the bourbon pecan pie and I had the mixed berry shortcake (both very DELICIOUS!). Our waitress was very attentive, answered questions/offered suggestions and was very attentive to our needs. Afterward we enjoyed the pool for a little while wasn't crowded at all and very clean plenty of towels.

The weather at Ocean City was perfect, the boardwalk was hopping, the skies blue and sunny. The hotel exceed my expectations. The suite was large and nicely furnished.

All full sized appliances in the kitchen including dish washer and blender. Wi fi in the rooms to surf the laptop. Two flat screen TVs in the room with lots of great channels.

We stayed from the 16th-18th of March. We did not want to leave! Everyone there was really nice and accomodating. The indoor pool is very clean with unlimited towels, you can have walk up service from the window that connects to 32 Palm and bar. Just walk up to the window and ring the bell service where you can order anything you want from the 32 Palm menu and eat it poolside. The one day the pool was warmer then the other. It also stays open til midnight and I would recomend adults to go down after 6. We were very lucky and both days we had the pool to ourselves. =). The game room has a nice variety of games to keep children and inner children occupied and the fitness center is very nice and clean. They have tables outside in the hallway you can sit down and relax.They have a mini gift/toilitries shop that pretty much covers everything you may have forgotton or need. Be warned on off season the Starbucks is only open on Fridays or the weekend. We were sad we didn't get our starbucks fix, but the coffee was very good in the room. We stayed on the top floor room 1212, it is right by the elevators but far away enough to not hear much. Complimentary Laundry and vending machines on every floor. Our room was very very clean. When I travel I always use chlorox wipes to wipe everything down just incase something was missed. The living room was very nice with a table with four chairs, a couch and another chair and a flat screen tv. The lighting in that room was very nice and relaxing. The kitchen is a good size and a nice kitchen at that. It sets you up with everything you need. The bathroom was clean, the grout could of been a little cleaner looking but it was fine. The jacuzzi tub is wonderful and can accomodate two people without being cramped. The jacuzzi jets are great and the water gets really hot so it is a nice little hot tub going on. The rain shower head is very nice and big and big enough for two people to use at once. The pressure was perfect for us. There are two double sinks. Amenities include toiletries, make up mirror, hair dryer and lots of toilet paper. They also supply lots of towels which we loved and didn't have to call down to get extra! The robes were very comfy and we wore them the whole trip! Turn down service you get fresh ones with chocolates! The bedroom was very clean and comfy. The king sized bed was sooooooooooooooooo clean. The sheets clean and crisp and soft. The matress was perfect as were the pillows. We slept great!! The balcony is a great size, with a good size table and chairs. The view is amazing. The balcony was also VERY private considering we were on the top floor. You are very close to the ocean, so the ocean waves will put you to sleep. With the exception for a light lunch at Fager's Island one day (do not recomend there offseason menu, it was lacking and service as well) we had room service the whole time for our meals! I would recomend going to Superfresh and getting drinks, snacks and forgotten toilitries/meds but the food at the Hilton delivers and is very tasty! Getting room service especially for breakfast and sitting out on the balcony is a must, so relaxing!!! All of our meals we recieved were fine and delicious! All the food came very hot and fresh! You could tell they just made it! From other Hotels/Resorts that are in the same price range, I found that the Hilton O.C. really delivered in terms of you get what you pay for. The room service were very prompt and friendly! Everyone that works there is very friendly. Our only \"con\" would be we felt that at the front desk, they needed better training at being sociable or more friendly when greeting guest. For example when we checked in and walked toward the check in, the employees SAW us, but did not greet us with a \"Hello Welcome\" we actually said Hello first and after we friendly greeted them was when they friendly greeted us back. That is a pet peeve of mine. So I would say to the manager to tweak his employees greet etiquette a little better especially have it ready for the In season when the prices range from 300-500+. Other then that everyone was very friendly and helpful! As for O.C itself for this time of the season, everything is pretty much closed. So if you are bringing children, there really isn't much for them to do with the exception of indoor golf by 70th street which also has food and a little arcade. The boardwalk was dead and most the restaurants good shops and rides/games were closed. So we decided our best bet was to eat at the Hilton the whole time because we knew the food was good and fresh. If you are going for romance and privacy this is the best time to come and get holed up in your suite and go swimming and feel very vip! Pets are welcome also! All the pets there were quiet,well behaved,friendly and clean! It was very cute watching them play on the beach from our balcony! My bf and I talked about bringing our dogs down this time next year! This pretty much sums up our stay! If we could suggest anything, we would say add a spa, tennis courts and have late night dining open til midnight instead of 11! =)", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spotswood, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWe LOVE Ocean City, MD\u201d", "Author": "Paulsgal916", "ReviewID": "UR57533854", "Content": "My husband and I have been to OC, MD 4 times in the past 6 years.

It turned out to be a memory pleaser as we found 6 inches of sand on the boardwalk the next day. So memorable, that we thought this hotel was going to be an annual tradition as many make Ocean City an annual tradition. As a preface to place this hotel in perspective of my following opinion... a) In all my stays at Hilton OC, I used Hilton Honors reward points for a free multi-night stay. I was their first member to hit a million points as they shut my account down for 3 months when I hit this point because their systems stopped b) I have travelled the world and I stay at some of the better to best hotels c) My previous career included studies, apprenticeships, and management of hotels for an exisiting hotel chain. The Hilton Ocean City stays were easier with a Diamond membership and more difficult with a Gold membership, but possible if you book early. In the 3 of the 4 years, most requests were handled for a high floor, non-smoking suite. This brings up another point. If someone smokes on a balcony below or next to you, be aware that smoke will get inside your suite. This has happened everytime we were above the 1st floor. Every year, we have had to ask at least once during our stay to get our room cleaned. This last stay, we came back from the pool for a few minutes at around 4pm, and the maid was entering our room. We placed the turndown service card for after 6 pm service - the day maid removed it and we missed the service as we returned at 9pm. I have seen other complaints about the late day or lack of cleaning, and the hotel has NO excuse. The Executive Housekeeper knows they are full for most of the entire summer - this is no surprise as they can plan accordingly with their staffing levels, their linen supply, etc. Again, there is no excuse! In addition, MAKE SURE TO PLACE THE CARD FOR SHEETS TO BE CHANGED on the pillow as advised on the card. If you place it only on the bed, and NOT on the pillow, the maid will not change the sheets. I know this because I suspected they really do not change the sheets in this hotel. So, the first night, I placed the card on the sheets. They were not changed because I made a 'L' mark with a pen on the inside corner of the sheet. When we returned to the room, I found the sheets to be clean. However, the maid did not change the sheets because the one sheet still had the pen mark. I did not complain to the hotel. The next day, I placed it the card on the pillow, and the sheets were changed. I am also not sure why the maids do NOT place their carts to block the suite door. This is not only for thier safety, but also for the safety of any items you leave in the front part of the suite. Without the cart blocking, one can easily walk intot he front part of the suite and grab anything without the maid's knowledge. also, ALWAYS make sure to pull the door shut on the way out. After the 1st year, the hotel has seemed to settle or the expansion from the heat in the summer prevents the door to close and lock properly. Pool area.... I give a lot of credit for the design of the pool for the kids - this is a great hit! It was also a wise management decision to not allow those under 16 in the outdoor jacuzzi - this adult area is usually ruined by kids in other hotels. I would advice them to make the sign about this bigger. In the last 2 years, I suspect the hotel is cutting back in pool cleanliness. in 2008, both of my daughters came down with swimmer's ear immediately after their stay. This year, my brother-in-laws 3 kids at the end ofg July, my wife's friend's family two children who stayed at the hotel in the beginning of August, and my 2 daughters and myself all came down with swimmer's ear immediately after our stays. All of the above were in the kids pool at one point. My wife was only in the adult pool and ocean water. My one older daughter and all the other kids in the two other families never went into the ocean water as they were all scared. This year, I did not go to the indoor pool. The conclusion is that swimmer's ear comes from the childrens outdoor pool. The above 2 families were recommended this hotel, and this swimmer's ear made it a disappointment. The indoor pool is great for those rainy days. The gym was satisfactory for my wife. The game room as well as the business center sufficed. The hotel does offer activities from children aged 11 and under. Not so much for those 12 and older. the hotel really does not have a great location other than the nice beach in front and a short walk to McD, BKs, the liquor store, a small breakfast place. It is away from the hustle and bustle at the south end of the boardwalk. Lots of things require some sort of vehicle. The hotel does offer free fruit at the front desk, but they should also send someone out to the beach to pick up the green guest towels which end up in the dump bins of the nightly beach cleaning crew via city owned tractors. More waste.... For a free suite, I would not complain as much, but I do expect to be treated the same way as a paying guest because HHonors does pay $380 for the suite. So, if you are a Diamond/Gold member, remind the hotel manager that they are still getting paid a good dollar for the suite. However, if I paid the exhorbitant rates of $450+ per night, I KNOW I am better off saving up and going to Hawaii or the Carribean. This hotel is owned by a local parent company who owns several other high end hotels. I learned in hotel school that a hotelier can make a property exceed on a pricing category. This parent company has truly succeeded at using this pricing strategy to make the Hilton successful. The value by each reviewer here makes their own jusgement. As stated, this year was our last stay at this hotel.

Our Hilton Honors preferences state that I prefer a high floor, away from the elevators. Upon check in we went to our room on the 10th floor which satisfies the first preference. The problem was our room was right in front of the elevators. I immediately called the front desk and they apologized and said that they see our preferences and they don\u2019t know why we were issued that room. A manager come up and immediately moved us to room 1113 which was high and away from the elevators. No big deal just a minor inconvenience. What happened next is inexcusable. We started to unpack and my wife and kids removed their shoes while in the room. About 30 minutes later my wife yelled that something cut her foot. I got on my hands and knees and saw a small rusted fish hook in the carpet. I put the hook in a plastic bag and took it to the front desk. I handed it to a host at the front desk. He said, yes, it happens sometimes and that\u2019s why \u201cwe\u201d recommend wearing shoes in the hotel rooms? Really? I have to wear shoes in a $500/night hotel room for fear of fish hooks?

The manager a apologized and came to room and took a formal report, offered some bandages and the location of a medical center and left. We contacted our family doctor and he instructed my wife to get a tentus shot. We contacted the medical center the manager referenced and unfortunately they didn\u2019t take our insurance. I went to the front desk and asked in Hilton would cover the $120 tenus shot; they did. At no point during our stay did Hilton contact my wife to see how she was doing.

I agree with all of the great reviews about the hotel that i read on this website. My 2 year old LOVED the kids pool - the waterslides are great and appropriate for kids from age 2 to adults! This hotel is super kid-friendly. I think that we saw kids come out of every room on our floor - even the \"adult pool\" had tons of kids in it - even sitting at the swim up bar! This was fine wtih me given our situation and the type of vacation we were aiming for, but just a warning to couples who may be looking for a romantic getaway. The music at the adult pool was nice too. The balcony and ocean views were awesome. We ordered room service one night and ate on the balcony - not sure if you would find a view like that at any restaurant in OC- and the food from the hotel restaurant (32 Palm) was excellent as well. The beaches were very clean and it was convenient to walk onto the beach from the hotel. If you have never been to OC, Maryland, don't expect much from the town. We did some exploring but if we went back, would not leave the hotel. Most of the other hotels we saw were very old and run down and the boardwalk was nothing special. Same to be said of the Jolly Rodger Amusement park across the street - rides were old and kind of gross. I would go back and just enjoy the hotel and the beach and save the amusement parks for somewhere else. The only thing negative I can say is that I wish the pool bar/restaurant was open later.

We've stayed at the Carousel, but finally lost patience with the old, musty, worn interior that is the standard in this resort town. We were about to abandon OC all together for the DE or VA beaches until the Hilton opened. We wanted an experience sort of like a resort where we really didn't have to leave the hotel. We wanted the room to be as fun and relaxing as any other part of our get away. Overall, the Hilton delivered. We stayed for 3 nights and paid an obscene $600/night including taxes for a corner king room. We arrived 3 hours before check in and were given immediate access to the parking garage and the pool areas. They took our cell phone numbers to call us when the room was ready. We were physically in our room 2 hours before check in. Love that! The room was very spacious, clean and well maintained, decorated in predictably modern hues of aqua with dark woods with free wi-fi. The view was great, but not an L-shaped balcony as I had expected. In fact, it was a bit on the small side. For a spectacular balcony view with a hot tub, book a Terrace Suite. The regular rooms are laid out exactly like our room, but they are smaller and you don't have the bay views. The bedroom area was large with a comfortable and clean king bed (with good sheets!), flat screen TV with plenty of channels and movie options, a sink and a jacuzzi (with pretty weak jets) with a window southern view of OC. There was a door you could shut and lock to keep out the kiddies. Next to that was a full size galley kitchen with the basics. From a decor perspective I do not understand why the appliances were white. They didn't look like they belonged at all. At this price point, the lack of attention to that detail was curious. Still, I appreciated having a full kitchen in a hotel that is clearly geared towards families. The bathroom is off the kitchen. It's a dark room, but nice, clean and modern with two sinks and a large shower with 3 shower heads. Personally, I'd rather have one good shower head than three with relatively weak pressure like this one. On the other end of the kitchen is a living space with a table, desk, flat screen TV and pull out couch. This room had a view of south OC and the bay. The pull out was very uncomfortable but our exhausted 9 year old did not notice. The pools in the hotel were fabulous and a big reason why we splurged. The kids pool in particular is a lot of fun with a shallow beachy looking area for smaller kids and a deeper, more aggressive area that featured a slide, a lazy river and whirlpool for older kids. WARNING: if you have younger kids who are not fully independent swimmers, don't expect this pool to be relaxing, even if it is fun. We opted to be in the water in shifts with our 3 year old. The lazy river and the whirlpool are fine if you're tall enough to stand or a decent swimmer, but a lot of smaller children were left by unknowing parents to fend for themselves in this area only to be plucked out by one of two VERY OBSERVANT lifeguards. Unlike many pool guards these guys were on their game, and in my opion they were the most conscientious employees at this hotel. I also appreciated the restaurant service in the pool area. The wait staff was very attentive if you indicated you wanted something and they even threw in a free cup of fruit garnish from the bar for our tired and cranky toddler. In the adult area, the bar is swim-up. The indoor pool looked big and nice, though we had no need for it on this trip. We didn't eat at the hotel, though I would have liked to try their lunch menu. Their dinner menu is ridiculously priced (though you do get a 20% off coupon as a guest) and nothing really even caught my attention. They should offer their lunch sandwiches as dinner options if you ask me. The bottom line is that there is nothing bad to say about this hotel except that I expected more for my money. There was an UMPH missing. I'm heading to St Lucia in February and my $600/night room there comes with my own butler! How about free beach-chair and umbrella rental, for example? How about offering masseuses at a discount to patrons?

The bathroom centrally located was beautiful with a walk in 4 head shower that felt amazing. The kitchen area was also very nice with kitchen utensils and pots and pans for those cooking. We also liked the Jacuzzi in the main room and the girls got in it together with their bathing suits on while watching a movie at night. The 2 flat screens on the wall in both main living areas were great to watch and added a real high end feel to the rooms. The balcony was large and we spent a good deal of time listening to the ocean and relaxing. At sunset we went to the other window and watched it set over the bay, another great treat. The location was great and we walked and biked and enjoyed the convenience of being situated so near to the action. The beds were very large and comfortable and it could easily sleep 6 people in the large 2 rooms and pull out couch. The high speed internet and corner wood desk was great for checking email and web surfing for OC events and activities. The fitness center and indoor pool were great, we spent a good amount of time at each.

If your not eating breakfast on the great ocean front deck than this is a good place to eat. The really nice part of this hotel suite is the kitchen with full size fridge, stove, sink and dishwasher. Unusual for most suite hotels. Although we ate all our dinners out we were able to have a quick breakfast and pack a lunch to take down to the beach.

Fred the bellhop was very cordial and goofed around with my son while unloading our luggage. I was dissapointed to have to wait very long for a room when I thought we were guaranteed a 3pm checkout. It was worth the wait. Very nice and clean except our backs needed realignments after the beds. I'm so glad to be home on my mattress after their's. Great fruit in lobby every day. The best oranges, bananas, apples and even kiwi. The front desk addressed me by name every day. Big turnoff was kids craft activity. I saw a note at desk that said 2pm the kids can make pinwheels. My son really wanted to stay and make one so we changed our plans around that day to wait for 2pm. When we went down Joann who was working the desk in the craft room said it was booked. We never saw a signup sheet or a note on calender that said it was full. She told us we had to wait at least another half hour to come back and see if he can get it. Very UNaccomadating for a Hilton. She was very rude and uncaring and really should not be employed in doing crafts with children. Another parent told me a little girl was crying in the bathroom because she got turned away. Not very nice to upset the kids! I as well as other parents complained and Nicole did accomadate us and even noticed that the room could easily fit more children to take 15 minutes to make a pinwheel. We did not eat at the restaurant since we prefer the all u can eat buffet and crab legs at the Bonfire and the fabulous crab bisque at Captain's Gallery off of 50th street. The weather was not that nice but it didn't matter in this hotel. Heated outdoor pools and indoor pool that was open until midnight and big comfortable rooms with balconies to read a book on. Been to Ocean City Md for 20 years and this was by far the best hotel we stayed in, esp. if you have small children who would enjoy the pools and slides and whirlpools. Our last day we usually check out and head home but they have great changing rooms with showers and shampoo so we stayed on beach until after dinner and was able to shower and ride home fresh and clean. That gave us a whole extra day that we don't ever get at other hotels. One thing to note was I thought I heard fire alarms in distance but didn't really know what it was. As we went down hall to go to town, I smelled smoke and looked out back window to see throngs of firetrucks and people in streets looking up at our building. Other people on our floor were panicked and could not get an elevator. I realized that our building was on fire. We ran down the steps to lobby thinking the alarms did not operate on our floor. The firemen told us the fire was on second floor and contained so they only evacuated first and third floors but this had us shaken up since we did not know this was the policy. I later could not find that listed on emergency information in room so good to know for future.

Our trip started off by arriving three hours earlier than planned and we called the hotel and they told us that early check-in would not be a problem. We had a room ready for us on arrival. Fred greeted us at the car and brought all the baggage to the room for us. What a pleasant man! I know it is his job, but he went above and beyond expectations. The suite was spacious and elegantly decorated. The hotel is situated off the boardwalk, but within walking distance. The Jolly Roger amusement park across the street was a huge disappointment. Three major rides were not working (flume log, ferris wheel and gravitron). Seems like they were all cable and mechanical issues. Not worth the money at 33rd street, but if you want to experience the amusements I would advise to go to the one located at the Pier. The hotel kiddie pool was AWESOME. The pics on here do not do it justice. Very warm and relaxing! Well supervised by lifeguards too. My kids (5 and 2) must have done the slides 70 times! I even did it a few times. Rooms were very quiet and did not hear neighbors in rooms next to us. The hotel was clean, beach was beautiful and stay was lovely. The beds were amazingly comfortable. We cooked in the kitchen for all meals which kept costs down. Also, i would highly recommend going to Fishtales for dinner. It is located at 21st street on the bay.

This year we decided to save the airfare- and give the Hilton OC a try since it's only 4 hours from home. The hotel is very nice. I won't say I was completely WOW'ed by anything specifically- but you won't have any complaints- and there are definitely some nice touches. In early June- the prices haven't yet gone completely through the roof- and the pools are generously heated. My boys ( 8, 11, 13) all had fun in the kiddie pool. There are no tubes for the lazy river. The area would really be too congested for that. We all cut our feet at one time or another in the lazy river area. The water circulates quickly and can knock you around-although there are plenty of areas in the pool that are not rough- and easy for little ones navigating around. The adult pool has a swim-up bar and had outdoor entertainment the one day that we were there. My tip would be to bring along a sleeve of plastic cups. You may bring your own drinks to the pool as long as you don't bring in glass. And there's a blender in the room. This pool is open until 8pm. The indoor pool is open until midnight. The rooms were VERY clean. Comments about it being a little dark...yes- in the living area. But they do provide you with lighting options galore, so you could get it really bright if you wanted too. The sacrifice in natural light comes with the bonus of knowing that EVERY single room is ocean front. We were there during Senior Week, but you would never know it while you are at the hotel. It's expensive and doesn't attract kids coming to party. Another guest did tell me that she was heckled on the boardwalk for wearing her blue band while walking around. I personally wouldn't wear the band outside of the hotel area- just in case. But if you do- sure you'll be fine. Other nice touches....Crabtree & Evelyn products, fresh fruit in the lobby every day, laundry services free to guests. We were even surprised when we got a soda from the vending machine( which is one of the newer ones and entertaining all on it's own - if you've not seen it yet!!) Coke was $1.00 a bottle- or .40 a can. I had expected to pay $3.00 a bottle in this place. My family liked the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom , but the reviews were mixed on the rainfall shower head. Looking for some complaints???? The toilet paper is a far stretch from the toilet. My 8 year old couldn't reach it and needed help. That's about it. This hotel is very service oriented. By the 3rd day, I was kind of annoyed that our room wasn't getting made up until 4:30 pm- but I'm positive this would've been addressed if we had complained. We had a beautiful morning and saw dolphins galore around 6:00am. If you don't see dolphins, I'm convinced it means a storm is on the way. That certainly held true for us- at least. You are about a ten minute walk from the Boardwalk, but there aren't a lot of restaurants at the end- so be sure you aren't too hungry when you get there- because there's a walk ahead of you to hit the bulk of the restaurants. We didn't eat there but heard that Peppers is a 5 star Mexican dive and well worth it. You are right across the street from Andrew's Subs, Burger King, McDonalds- and Jolly Roger Amusements. Additionally, it's a short walk to Fractured Prune (yummy!) doughnuts and Happy Jack's Pancake House. Nothing fancy, but the pancakes were good. There is a Starbucks kiosk in the hotel, but they aren't full functioning and can't make frappucinos there. As for Ocean City dining....Our boys were excited for seafood buffets- which they'd never experienced. The Bonfire was rated high. Not impressed. It's fine. Some things were better than others. Nothing will blow you away. The $19.99 special with a drink doesn't advertise that the drink is going to cost you $3.00 . Not a big deal- but a surprise. Phillilps food - by and large- was better. HOWEVER, I left feeling we'd been completely had. The experience starts when you walk up and must decide on the street if you are doing the buffet or traditional, which has separate entrances. The buffet people are hustled up the stairs - where you are forced to remain smashed up against the wall like a herd of cattle. It's expensive- so obviously you want to eat. The food was SOOOOO salty. I appreciate good food but am not picky by any stretech. There is no doubt in my mind that they oversalt the food to keep you from eating as much. It worked!!! And the ultimate kicker - causing the steam to rise to my ears.....your plate is a salad plate- not a dinner plate. The crab legs are \"handed \" to you. Portion control??? There is almost no room left on your plate. And the absolute best part????? It's EXTREMELY tight in there. There are lines with no beginning or ending...and they ( STRATEGICALLY???ABSOLUTELY!!!!!) place the plates in the middle of the buffet areas. Let me tell you , you have to REALLY want your food to be willing to wait in line to get to a plate...then back track along- injecting yourself in lines- making people mad. Then ..just try to get your crowded plate back thru the lines to your table!! Good luck!!This had the feel of being in a crowded bar- trying desperately to fight the crowds to get to a rest room. I gave up. It wasn't worth it. I would NEVER EVER let myself be had like this at Phillips again. We met friends at Fish Tales. The kids will love the pirate ship and the sand. We weren't impressed with the $6.99 hot dog kid's meal- and should probably have just ordered our son a cheesesteak. The food was ok. The atmosphere is great to sit and talk- drink by the bay. I can see that they try to get you out of there quickly- since it would be easy to spend an entire night there taking up a table that they could be turning. My husband liked Piezano's Pizza on the Boardwalk. I thought bang for buck Wrappers was good. Yummy pretzel stuffed with real crabmeat....$6.00. The Polish Water Ice was watery. We liked Dip N Dots. Th Candy Kitchen no longer carries chocolate covered gummy bears but they have great sales bins on their Webkinz!!! All in all-if you're going to be in Ocean City, MD for some reason....by all means stay at the Hilton. The hotel is fine. It's just a shame that Ocean City is such a rat hole.

The staff immediately greeted us on the way in and again at the top of the steps. The rooms were very, very plush with flat screens, a king size bed with topper, high quality furniture, a full kitchen and a very modern bathroom w/ sunken tub. The balcony view was just awesome and although it was winter time, the grounds were kept up. So, I could only imagine that the swim up bar and the outdoor waterpark in the summer would just be a kids and parent's paridise.

A relative insisted that we \"HAVE\" to stay at Hilton. He had stayed there during the fall. He is a seasoned business exec who has traveled all over the country. His exact words were \"one of the best hotels I've ever stayed\". He was right. We arrived Sunday at 2:30. Parking was convenient, very close to the main entrance (it is the off season). We only had one over night bag a piece along with a small bag with snacks and wine so we did not require bell services. Check in was quick and smooth. We headed up to our 7th floor room. The elevator and halls were very clean. Upon room entry, we were immediately taken back by the breath taking view of the ocean, the room decor and ammenaties. It was almost a sensory overload. We entered a sitting area that contained a pull out sofa, flat screen TV, 4 seat dining table, and coffee and end table, and chair. We then entered the kitchen area that was absolutely immaculate with no grease or food stains. Pots/utelsils/ dinnerware/ appliances all in perfect condition. The bathroom was a dream, containing a jacuzzi tub and Crabtree and Evelynn ammenaties. The sleep area was extremely comfortable with 2 queen beds, another flat screen TV, closet, and chair. The closet contained 2 terry robes. Our oceanfront balcony was well appointed with a patio style table and 2 chairs. We had not had lunch so we ordered room service. Very fast service, and delicious. Not extremely outrageous at $34. Very generous portions. We couldn't eat it all. We stayed in and watched the game. At 8:30 we decided to have a snack in the pub. Our cheeseburgers were very good. Morning and the 11 am checkout came too soon! We stayed until the very last minute to take it all in. As soon as we are able , we will return. Our only regret about the Hilton was that we didn't book another night.

Can't beat the hotel property with two pools, and steps to the beach, we didnt have any issues finding parking when we returned at various times of the day.

Did not eat at the restaurants except pool bar and service was ok. Kids pool is really nice with the waterslides and a type of whirpool which is really fun and a lazy river. Unfortuantely they only had one hot tub even thought they have a kids pool and adult pool. Both pools are very nice but generally you have to get there early to get a good seat. Pool is mostly in the shade after 3. All staff from the maids to check in were very friendly. The room was nice and spacious. They have down comforters and fluffy white robes which they change regularly. They also give you as many towels as you like which is nice as some hotels can be kind of chintzy with towels. Also had nice hot pool towels. Some days the pool was warm where as other days it was not as hot as it should have been. I did not find the lifeguards that nice. Room had nice flatscreen tvs and the maids were very nice and did a good job of cleaning and always came back if you were not ready to leave the room. Did not love the CrabTree and Evelyn products like Aveda or a similar lesser fragrance brand than Crabtrree which is too fragrant for a mass tyoe of place. Starbucks coffee was always good. For some reason they do not call them grande but small medium and large. Never saw that at a Strabucks before but in any case it was nice to have good coffee in the morning and and ice coffee as the day went on. Great location. Right on the Ocean and Ocean area totally clean. only had one hose to wash feet for the whole hotel after coming back from Ocean which made for long line ups!!!!

I returned twice more and was told to return in 15 minutes. On the fourth try we got our room. It was almost 4:30 PM which is after check in.

The rooms are great because you have a small but very useful kitchen fully stocked with anything you would need while on vacation. We eat breakfast and lunch in the room and dinner out most nights.

I chose the 5th floor and was given my keys and information, which included coupons for free continental breakfast or $9 off (each) our breakfast bill instead. They also gave us wristbands to be worn at the pools. ROOM \u2013 In the living room area, there was a sofa, chair and small table with chairs. There was a large flat screen television and DVD player. The kitchen was between the living room and bedroom and had a full size refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, microwave, toaster and blender. The bathroom was a good size, with double sink and a large tub with a \u201crain\u201d showerhead. The toiletries were Crabtree & Evelyn and consisted of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, mouthwash, soap and shower caps. The bedroom was a good size and also had a flat screen television and DVD player. We had two queen beds that were very comfortable. There was a fairly large balcony that overlooked the pools and beach. The balcony had a small table and four chairs. There was a safe in the closet. DINING \u2013 There was a Starbucks coffee stand in the lobby that also sells muffins, yogurt, cookies, etc. The cookies are very large and expensive but were good. We used our coupons to eat in the restaurant for breakfast. The food was good but expensive. They had a kid\u2019s menu for breakfast, but the prices were also high. There is a grill by the adult pool that is open at lunch, but we didn\u2019t eat there. RECREATION \u2013 There is an adult pool, indoor pool, and a family pool. The family pool is great. It is heated, has a zero entry area, two slides (one big enough for adults), a small lazy river, and splash areas. We spent most of our time in this pool. It got crowded by late morning but never felt too crowded. Lifeguards were on duty whenever we were there. Towels were available at the pool, and there was a bathroom right off the pool area. The adult pool seemed empty most of the time. There were people sunning by the adult pool, but I never saw more than two people in it at a time. The hotel is right on the beach. The beach was fairly wide, not too crowded, and there was a lifeguard stand right near the hotel. There is also an exercise room and a small arcade in the hotel.

The boardwalk is about 3 miles long and ends at 27th street. It is a short walk from the hotel at 32nd street, but the more commercial part of the boardwalk is approximately 1 mile or so from the end near the hotel. There is an open-air tram/shuttle that runs from one end of the boardwalk to the other and costs $3 each way. The cost is the same even if you don\u2019t take the entire trip but get on/off in between. There are ticket counters at each end, but if you want to get on in between, you need to have exact change.

The hotel is right on the beach with only a few steps separating you from the two outdoor pools and the sand. The kids pool is an amazing amenity which kept our kids playing for hours. The \"adult\" pool has a nice swim-up bar but we saw more than a few intoxicated folks making the pool less desirable to swim laps or just hang. A nice indoor pool completes your water options. If you're still eager for more water, there's a large water park across the street. Go in the afternoon for discounted rates. My only con comment is that around 3pm the sun falls behind the hotel and none of the pools get any sun, also cooling the temperature significantly. They have an awesome (free) kids activity program where they do arts & crafts, cooking classes in the afternoon and movies almost every night. Food is a little overrated and costly but as long as you use the kitchen in the suite, you can save some $$$ there. The rooms were very spacious, clean and up-to-date. Room service every morning along with a newspaper by your door. Amazing ocean view from virtually every room balcony. The service was mostly great with plenty of smiles and helpful hands like always getting you an elevator as you approach the door. The only negative we experienced was during checkout and we asked for a late checkout. The lady at the front desk was adamant that they do not allow this with no if, and, but or any exceptions. The policy would've been easier to accept had she taken the time to explain the rule but instead she was very short, and stern. Suggestions: If you're driving, bring a sun umbrella and chairs to sit at the beach. You can also rent from EDs beach service. Park your car underneath the hotel by the entrance to the beach.

This is the perfect place for a family, room was great, kiddie pool was great. This was my first time in OC and there is so much to do. PROS on the Hilton: Room: Great view of the ocean - really setup nicely for families, kitchen was great - although we only utilized the dishwasher and frig. Pools: Kiddle pool was great for our kids. The adult pool \"looked\" great as well, although all of our time was in the kiddie pool. The slides and everything was perfect. Location: I really enjoyed that this hotel was not on the boardwalk. Don't get me wrong, we liked the boardwalk, but having our room on the 9th floor away from the noice was very nice. Beds: The beds were very comfortable, the kids slept in cribs, which was no problem at all. Beach: Great location, although I wish the Hilton provided beach service as in drinks and lounge setup. CONS of the Hilton: Room service - typically good, although they missed a turndown service, not a huge deal, but still. Restaurants - we ate at 32 Palms, not the greatest, although not the worst. The service was good, but the food was somewhat of a miss. We also ate poolside, which was ok, nothing great. Pool Staff: They only had two girls working both pools, which was tough to order drinks, etc. They did a great job for the area they covered, just would have been nice if they had more people. Overall a great hotel and one that I will stay at with my family in the future. My wife and I have stayed at the Four Seasons in Maui, and many Hyatts along with Ritz Carltons.

There's a sitting area with an attached full kitchen and bathroom and a seperate sleeping area. The living room area has a flat screen TV and a couch which I think is a pull out. Theres also a table w/ 4 chairs. The kitchen has full sized appliances and was extremely clean. The bathroom is great. Double sinks w/ granite countertop and we had a jacuzzi tub which I\"m not sure if its standard in all rooms or not. It easily fit 2. Only downfall was it was a little difficult getting in and out just because it was deep. The shower was \"rain\" style with the showerhead coming out of the middle of the ceiling if that makes sense. I'm not a huge fan of those but it was nice. My only complaint with that was the shower water didn't seem really hot, but it may just seem like cooler because of the standing room in the tub/shower. The jacuzzi was definitely hot enough. On to the bedroom---a king sized bed that was very comfy, an additional flat screen TV and a balcony overlooking the pools and ocean. The pools looked great---especially the kids pool. However, it was very cool and windy so we didn't get to hang out out there. The service was great overall. We stopped by the lounge for a drink and the bartender was very friendly. Drinks were a little on the pricey side, but we kinda expected that. There was a restaurant, however we didn't eat there---that was pricey---$38 for filet mignon. Overall, this place is awesome. Granted we went in the off season, so prices were affordable.

We had 5 people in the room and had adequate space. The room floor plan has the same footprint, as many Embassy Suites- other than the bathroom is larger with upgraded fixtures and a Jacuzzi tub, the kitchenette is complete with a regular stove, full size refrigerator, dishwasher and plates, silverware etc. The balcony is sizeable, 4 chairs and a table and plenty of space. We traveled with 2 vehicles, the one parking pass per room is firm, however we never had to park the 2nd vehicle on the street any further away than the block that surrounds the hotel. The 1st floor rooms open directly to a patio balcony that opens directly to the pool deck- so there is no daytime privacy from the pool, the ocean view must be quite obstructed. Something important we did not get from previous reviews- those staying on the lower floors (we were on 5) over the kiddie pool- it can be quite loud with the sounds associated with children playing. We requested a room change to the other end over the \u2018adult\u2019 pool, they accommodated the change and it made a world of difference. Perhaps it was the week we were there but there was a strong majority of families with pre school age children with healthy lungs. The little things that made it nice- free laundry on each floor, free fruit at the front desk, free parking, a small business center to keep track of Emails, towels for poolside, the newness of the hotel, the Serenity beds are awesome, two flat screen TV\u2019s each room and a newspaper each morning. The rooms are kept very clean; the hotel staff is over all very friendly. The 32 Palm restaurant generally has very good food (I sent back a cold steak, but had 5 excellent breakfasts); service is good, but a little soft during the morning rush for breakfast (they get a bit overwhelmed assigning tables and getting people seated- we learned to go early). We had never been to Ocean City before and were pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and \u2018tame\u2019 crowd. The boardwalk ends at 27th; the hotel occupies the entire block between 32 and 33rd. There are lifeguards at the ocean most days. We stayed on Hilton Points so it is hard to comment on value. The poolside restaurant, Manana Mode, is convenient with prices one might expect being served food poolside/ ocean side. The majority of the guests were from NJ, NY, MD and some VA.

This hotel is only a year old and it had all the amenties as if you were on vacation in the islands. They have three pools: 1 kiddie (very kiddie, 2 ft) which is usually crowded. The hot tub on the kiddie side. The adult pool across the walk way with the swim up bar. There is also a grill (food delicious, but pricey) I bought a burger fries and a mud slide and paid almost $20. There is also an indoor pool which has bar access too. This pool closes at midnight. There is always something for the kids to do. The hotel was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The beds were comfortable. All the rooms are suites, so they had a kitchen area.

We booked the terrace suite with the jacuzzi on the terrace. Checkin was fine-we got there early so we figured it wouldn't be ready. Finally ready at 3 which was a bummer, but happens. Had a major problem with parking. The room sleeps 6 and that is how many we had. We even had to pay extra for those 2 people despite the fact the room was already 1200. Hilton only gives you one parking pass per room...no matter how many it sleeps. We could not possible have driven with 6 people and all our bags, beach chairs, etc so we took 2 cars. This was a major problem as there was no parking spots to be found down the entire strip. We drove up and down for over an hour. The hotel would not help us out at all and they were unfortunately very rude about it. Having stayed at a different hotel the previous year for less money and getting 2 spots per room, I was aggravated. I complained to the manager who could care less. We finally found a parking spot and left that car there for the entire weekend. Suite was really nice and in great condition however we had to stalk the front desk to get our room cleaned, get extra towels, even toilet paper throughout the weekend. One morning we found we were out of toilet paper and called down. After 4 more calls (it was 9am and with 6 people-it was urgent), we actually had to go find one of those housekeeping carts and get it ourselves. This was often the case with towels as well. Remember there were 6 of us. Pool bar and pool dining was great-what nice people working there! However, we would get there at 8-9am and most of the chairs were covered in towels. After 2 hours of no one sitting there, we would take them off and sit where we wanted to. Beach was great-can't beat the location! Restaurant for breakfast was good but service was so slow. We saw atleast 8 tables ready to go and yet had to stand with other people waiting outside the restaurant for 15 minutes. Once seated, it took an eternity to get a coffee refill or a straw for my juice. Food was good! Overall, nice hotel. But the staff at the front desk, including management are not concerned with making your stay a positive one. We really felt like they had our money (and a lot of it for 2 nights) so they really didn't care what our stay was like. This was very frustrating and for that we would NOT stay here again which is a shame b/c the hotel was beautiful. The management and staff are not concerned with you once you have paid.

The rooms are Ritz Carlton quality, one-bedroom mini-apartments that have granite-counter kitchens with stove, full refrigerator and freezer and a deep bathtub-Jacuzzi that comfortably fits two with a center, overhead shower. The location is a few blocks north of the boardwalk. Easy walking distance is a water park, a younger child amusement park and miniature golf.

The water is perfectly heated, \u201cahhh\u201d as soon as you step in, and it allows your kids to play comfortably in shallow water or on cooler days. There is an adult pool, large by shore standards, plain vanilla, four-feet deep. The other is a sizable children\u2019s pool and, perhaps more than any other feature, the reason this hotel is worth the premium price. The kids\u2019 pool has two water slides. One is small for the little ones dropping into one foot deep water. The kids climb up a pirate-looking boat that squirts water near the top. Water pours down the slide giving it just the right speed. My three year old was grinning non-stop the first hour. The other slide is long and not too fast, perfect for kids four and up as it drops them in three feet of water. Features for toddlers include a zero depth entry with ten water jets squirting up from the ground and a side pool area with a rubber whale that is six-inches deep. The hotel advertises a \u201clazy river,\u201d but this isn\u2019t really accurate. This lazy river is small, and it goes only half-way around, 180, not 360 degrees, so your float is short and then you\u2019re back in the main pool where you must swim over to the other side. There is nothing lazy about it. The river channel is too small for an adult tube and the Hilton doesn\u2019t provide the small $1 tubes that would allow your kids to float. Bring your own. Same with chairs for the beach. Ocean City does not permit the Hilton to provide them. You can rent on the beach from a vendor. In the middle of the lazy river area is something I\u2019ve never seen in any pool. There is a walled off whirlpool of water perhaps 12 feet across that spins the kids around in a circle, the water moving very fast. Kids seemed to enjoy it. The Hilton was sold out when we were there, and the pool was crowded during periods of high sun, but not overly so. There was little wait for the slides. There were two lifeguards sitting high up on chairs. There were lounge chairs available any time of day, and you can from the Hilton pool deck sit and watch the ocean. There is a high-end game room and fitness center. Our housekeeping experiences were very good (ignoring the half-eaten candy from a prior guest left on our refrigerator for two days). With a three-month season, your room is cleaned by college kids from eastern Europe. The negative (least you think I\u2019m a shill for the Hilton): Our air conditioning wasn\u2019t functioning properly. The room at night was 75 degrees, not uncomfortable, but we wanted 72. We complained on a Monday afternoon, but nobody showed up to repair it until 11 am Tuesday morning about an hour before we left. (Checkout is 11am, they gave us until noon). Three degrees may not seem like much, but at $400 per night you should be able to put ice on the walls. The swim-up bar was unattended. There was waitress service at the pools, but they didn\u2019t have ice tea, lemonade or bottled water. I had to walk to the Starbucks in the lobby. We didn\u2019t eat on-site, but I can tell you to avoid the Restaurante Antipasta across the street: bad news, and I paid $24 for a plate of mediocre spaghetti. Comment on the price: Online the price was $429 (Sunday) and $409 (Monday); after June 28 that jumps to $459. Knowing the NJ to VA shore does not sell out Sun-Thurs nights in June and early July, we just showed up. No reservation, and while my kids watched \u201cFinding Nemo,\u201d they have a kids movie at 6:00 each night, we got rates of $349 (Sunday) and $329 (Monday), no minimum stay.

The Hilton is by far the nicest hotel in Ocean City. Although its pretty much a newer version of the Holiday Inn Suites on 17th Street, the Hilton is very clean and elegant. Since it opened last year, it seems brand new. The rooms are some of the best hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. First of all they are huge! When you walk through the door, there is a living room with a flat screen TV, couch with a pull out bed, and a dining table and chairs. The next room is the kitchen, stocked with silverware, dishes, pots, etc. It has a stove, oven, microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, coffeemaker, etc. The bedroom is also large, with two queen beds or one king. It has a decent sized closet, a small safe to keep valuables, a flat screen TV, and a dresser. All rooms overlook the ocean. Rooms on higher floors have excellent views of the beach and ocean. We stayed on the 10th floor this time. The bathroom is huge compared to your average hotel bathroom. It has a jacuzzi tub and shower, two sinks, and plenty of counter space. The hotel itself is amazing. There are three pools- an indoor pool, a kids pool outside on the deck overlooking the ocean, and an outdoor pool with a swim up bar on the same deck by the ocean. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, where we went for breakfast a few mornings during our stay. There is always fresh fruit in the lobby. The hotel also has a small gym, a business center, and a game room. I've never been to the hotel restaurant 32 Palm, so I can't comment on that. The service at the hotel was excellent. The moment we arrived, around 10:00 pm on a Wednesday night, a bellman came to our car and put all of our belongings on a car. He waited with us in the garage as my mom went upstairs to check in, and then took us to our room. When we were ready to check out, on a Sunday right before 11:00 check out, we called downstairs and got a bellman with a cart immediately. Throughout our stay, there was always someone downstairs to greet you and get you an elevator. All staff members I met were very friendly and helpful. The only downside for me, which could actually be considered a plus for others, is the hotel's location. I prefer to stay on the boardwalk, and this hotel is quite a few blocks north of the boardwalk. I like the boardwalk because you can go to a variety of stores, restaurants, and attractions without a car. There is not much within walking distance to the Hilton. But to families with small children, the location is great because you're away from the noise and excitement found in downtown OC. I love Ocean City, and I love the Hilton. But next time I'm in Ocean City, I'll probably be staying at the Holiday Inn on 17th St. because of the location. But for families and people who are looking for a quiet and relaxing time in OC, the Hilton is absolutely perfect!", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "central pa", "Title": "\u201cLoved it again!\u201d", "Author": "Brianaerin", "ReviewID": "UR7927254", "Content": "We just came back for our second stay at The Hilton.

The hotel rooms at the Hilton were much smaller than they appear on the website. The resturant was slow and overpriced. The free continnental breakfast was a joke. You couldn't get a seat because the resturant is so small. A two hour wait doesn't work when you have small children.

All of these towns have lovely family beaches and have a 5-10 minute drive to an amusement boardwalk. If you go a trip to Island Beach State Park is a must.

We have never stayed at a Hilton before. We are Marriott rewards members and have always stayed in their chain hotels, but I wanted to see what the Hilton was all about. I booked a terrace suite with balcony and private hot tub. The only reason I booked this particular room was for the hot tub and for the duration of our stay.....the hot tub did NOT work. When we got to our room, we went outside to check it out and look for directions on how to use it....well, there were none to be found. I noticed pieces of rubber and plastic rings laying on the edge of the tub and had a feeling those pieces belonged to the drain stopper. My fiance decided to fill the tub up later that afternoon and could not keep the tub full, so he called the front desk and they sent a man to help us. He confirmed that the drain plug was broken on the tub and he would need to get a temporary stopper to close the hole. This would mean we would have to get all the way into the tub with it full of water to drain it. Well, we would have been able to do that, had the temperature risen above 75 degrees!! We had it set to go up to the highest temperature which was 104 degrees. After waiting for an hour and a half, it never reached a temperature above 80. So we assumed the heating element was broken as well as the drain and both of those things made it impossible for us to use it in 30 degree weather on the top floor!! The following morning I went to the front desk and complained about the hot tub situation and the lady adjusted our bill to a \"regular\" room rate. I thought all had been taken care of until today when I recieved my credit card statement showing an additional charge of 150.00 billed to my card. When I called and asked about the charge, the girl tells me the charge was for 2 bathrobes. Bathrobes???? There were NEVER any bathrobes IN our room...believe me, we looked all over for them when we decided to go and check out the hot tub! Now I am being charged for something I have never seen or asked for or used!!!!! When I asked to speak to a manager, the girl tells me everyone has left for the day and someone would get back with me tomorrow. I told her this was unexceptable and she went to look for the front desk manager. ( I thought no one was there?) When she got back on the phone, she tells me he is busy and will have to call me back when he gets a \"chance\". I am absolutely FURIOUS about my entire Hilton experience and I have called the corporate office. I am awaiting response to an email that was sent to the general manager of this property.

They are not hot tubs; they are jacuzzi tubs that you fill up every time you want to use them w/hot water from a spout, then you can set the temp to what you want and turn on the jets. No chemicals which is nice, fresh water every time, and you can wipe out the tub when it is empty. Very nice. I paid $379 by booking AAA rate soon after they opened in June; my stay was August 28-31. We were there the day of Storm Ernesto's fury and rain water came into the oceanfront patio door although it was closed tight, soaking the carpet about 5 ft. into the room.

We were told that there is no place to park bikes if you bring bikes w/you, that we'd have to take them into our room so we didn't take our bikes. Wrong- there is a bike rack in the underground parking area. There were no instructions for using the outdoor jacuzzi (where is the switch to turn it on, where is the plug), and no one at the service number knew either.

I suggest going across the street to the little hotel's breakfast place, inexpensive good food and great service. Also, the indoor pool had a lot of nasty bubbly foam in it. We were reluctant to use it as it looked wrong to us. Service man told us it was fine but coudl not say what it was.

It had a large bath which was perfect for the wife and kids, and though we did not use it, since we were afraid to leave the room and get groceries, the efficieny kitchen with full size refrigerator, stove, microwave, and dishwasher The flat screen TV s and jacuzzi tub were icing on the cake. The seond thing you notice is the staff's eagerness to please. They all greeted you with casual smiles and it seemed that they were genuinely happy to serve their guests. The bellman were friendly and helpful, the desk staff were very nice, and even room service was cheerful when you spoke with them on the phone. I especially was impressed by the concierge service, who not only were willing to provide excellent suggestions on eating establishments and activites, they also seemed to really know what OC was about and was more than eager to chat it up with you. During the Storm, we noticed that we lost power, but the generator quickly kicked in to keep everything moving along. This was very comforting, considering that the hotel was quite booked and there were many children present. Quite a few properties in the main island lost power during the sttorm and were not as quickly able to recover. While I thought this was a great hotel, it did not come without its challenges: 1) Restaurant staff were overburdened. We felt sorry for the waitress who was helping us at the Bar restaurant, as she was the only one there and the kitchen seemed to be understaffed as well. Many patrons were waiting well over an hour and a half for their food orders. 2) We all know that hotel food is not an economical dining option. However the Hilton Suites was out of control. Two burgers, two kids meals (no dessert or coffee), and 6 drinks wound up costing me $105 (and that was with the hour wait). While the food is very good at the Hotel, it was not worth the price. I would not recommend eating at the hotel if you have a choice. 3) The Kids Activites were a nice touch (and needed especially during the Storm) however it was very disorganized and frankly a little dangerous, as it seems that the staff does not yet have the experience in doing this. Many supplies ran out quickly and there was no organization in handing out supplies or managing the activities. The dangerous part came from the fact that the Kids Activites were basically meant for that -- an activity for kids, not a babysitting session. It is unfortunate that many parents do not watch their kids as they should, and many parents simply left their kids in the large conference room alone when there was not that much supervision by hotel staff. Kids could (and did) leave the conference room unsupervised. Other kids, who were looking for their parents who skipped out on them, wound up sitting there and waiting for their parents, and come of them started crying. If your family vacation plans include dumping your kids somewhere, you may want to review the meaning of the word 'family', and not bring the kids at all if you do not want to be with them. 4) The phone for whatever reason kept ringing at random times throughout the entire stay. No one knew why this was happening, though I think there was a glitch with their telephone network. i wound up having to disconnect the phones in the room to make it stop. All in all, it was a good hotel and I would definitely go back again. The hotel simply needs to augment their staff and require a little more training to make it a truly exceptional place to stay in Ocean City!", "Date": "September 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cMaybe not worth the price.....\u201d", "Author": "travelswith2", "ReviewID": "UR5717489", "Content": "We booked this hotel with our kids in mind (5 and 3) because we expected to have breakfast and lunch in the room...

Also, we woke tuesday morning and our stove wasnt working - we called at 7:30 am and they didnt send anyone until well after nine. We were offered free breakfast (in the restaurant only) and anyone with kids knows sometimes you are better off in your room.
