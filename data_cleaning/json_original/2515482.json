Free Breakfast was above average (fresh fruits, chinese food, made to order ommelette etc.) to similar \"breakfast included properties\".

We called the front desk, they said they would work on it and we could call them for a wake up call the next day instead of the automated system and they would be happy to give a call to the room.

Expedia gave us the best rate for a 1 bedroom King suite, full kitchen, $130 per night. For the price we paid and the suite we got, it was a case of good value. The suite was about 560 square feet and had more than enough space for a family of 4. The pull out sofa bed was adequate for the kids. The full kitchen made breakfast and snacks easy. There are restaurants and grocery stores about 3 miles away (10 minute drive). The Woodfin is nestled in a business district with a couple of hotels and a Chili's restaurant all within walking distance. Woodfin appears to have opened in 2000. In high traffic areas in the rooms, the carpet needs a major shampoo cleaning. Trimming in our room needed some work (missing some floor trimming when going from tile to carpet, baseboards needed some cleaning, dusting). In one part of our suite, the wall was sticky - most likely from pop spray/spill. Our washroom was relatively clean however, the staff should have been more attentive in the corners. We used the pool a couple of days and a suite overlooking the pool area. It did not appear that staff was attentive to pool maintenance - even the changing of the used towel bin. Overall, the Woodfin was an okay stay. It is a good long term alternative to most hotels. For the same price you will get a smaller place to stay with maybe a mini-fridge and a mike. Woodfin staff should be more attentive when cleaning suites and pool maintenance. It was not a bad start to our 2 week vacation in California.

Small salt & pepper, sugar packets, coffee. Awkward layout for groceries. Master bedroom: large king bed, microsuede duvet cover, very comfortable. Plenty of TV channels, but NO DVD player (only in main room). Bathroom: nice soaps, large layout, medium shower pressure. Main area: fold out couch was good for one kid. Enough room to add a cot. TV seemed small in the space, but was fine. Awkward placement for the TV behind the desk, so anyone working on a computer there would block the TV (fine since there was another TV in the bedroom). Internet: rooms only have a plug-in connection and a charge for this service. The Internet cable barely reaches into the bedroom and the hotel should consider longer ones. Free Internet is available in the lobby and restaurant areas. Restaurant: happy hour was fun; mini Kobe beef burgers half price ($7) and tasty. Located next to the pool area. Surprised that breakfast was NOT included in the price of the room -- we did not try it. Chili's was the nearest walking distance restaurant. Other: Laundry service expensive. $7.50 to launder a shirt. Cheaper to go to Target/Old Navy and buy a new one. Also, they do accept pets. Pool was very warm, but the kids loved it. Some seating is still in the splash zone, so watch your laptop. A variety of DVDs to rent (a deposit is charged to the room, but removed when DVD is returned). Small store near lobby but expensive.

Having a living room and separate bedroom made is ever more better. One can sleep while others can watch TV or stay up in the living room. I love having the kitchenette, it saved us on time and money. We shopped for breakfast items and every morning we would eat from our room. Dishes, glasses and utensils are provided. There is a toaster, coffee maker, microwave and some microwavable containers, but no stove which is fine beause who has time to cook? There is a full-sized fridge and a small table for two.

The bath towels were not neatly placed on one occassion; no big deal but liitle things like this can help keep customers satisfied.

There was a king size bed in the room which we thought was really comfortable and a seperate lliving room with a sleeper sofa, 2 tvs and one with a dvd player. You can borrow dvd's downstairs in the lobby for free, 2 at a time but the dvd selection is very limited. There was only about 30 dvds to choose from and they were mostly the old movies like forest gump, charlie's angels and a few kids movies as well. They do have the disney channel which was nice for the kids so we mostly watched that instead. You can also request a crib which we did for my youngest son and you will get an evenflo portable crib. For some reason we had some trouble getting one into our room though. I had asked for one when I first checked in but an hour and a half later I had to call down to the front dest and ask them to bring one up. An hour later still no crib so this time I actually went down stairs to the lobby and told them that the crib has still not been delivered and this time finally they brought one to me about 10 minutes later. That was probably my only complaint about the hotel. The hotel was only about 15 to 30 minutes to all the places that we visited but it is located in a hotel/ business area so there is nothing within walking distance. No stores or anything nearby. I had to buy milk for my son and the closest place that sold it was at a shell gas station which was about 4 - 5 lights away. There is also a food court next to the gas station as well but most of the restaurants were closed on sunday. Only 3 were opened which was a japanese, thai and indian restaurant. In the other direction though which is about 1 or 2 lights down the street is a chili's restaurant and by the 805 freeway entrance is a mc donalds. The hotel does have a restaurant by the lobby but the menu is very limited. I wished that they had more items to choose from. Only a few items and nothing seems very interesting. Just salads, sandwiches and a few other things. We did order breakfast though, I had the omelet and my husband had the two eggs with bacon, and potato. Breakfast was alright but costed us about $20. On the internet it stated that the hotel has complimentary breakfast but they do not have one. I think they got rid of it because of the new restaurant that they have added to the hotel. They also have a small rectangle size pool and a hot tub. They also have a small area next to the lobby that sells drinks like champagne, beer, soda, snacks, and other stuff. Oh, and we had a room that faced a launching pad for hot air balloons. We had no idea and then on Sunday all of a sudden we looked out of our room and saw 7 hot air balloons. The kids got excited over that. I also thought that we got a great deal on the room too! We had payed $149 each night and that was on a holiday weekend! I had spent so many nights searching for the best deals on hotel and I was so happy to have found this one! It pays to do your research on prices because I had checked about 10 websites and they all had the same price for this hotel at $179 but only one website had it for the price that we payed.
