The service is ok, but not spectacular and certainly less than expected from a 5-star hotel. I would avoid the restaurant as the food was not special (or warm for that matter). There is nothing to do around so avoid this hotel if you want to do something outside the hotel. It is far away from the city (20 km to the airport and 45-50 km to the city centre), so be careful about that. Walls are so thin that you can hear the conversations from neighbouring rooms. Couples beware!! We made the mistake to book a room over the weekend with my wife and checked out a day early and booked another hotel to get over this one.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade, Serbia", "Title": "\u201cI got much better than I paid for it !\u201d", "Author": "Zvezdan M", "ReviewID": "UR121396664", "Content": "I just came back today. I was there for 3 days, attending exhibition in Tuyap exhibition center. Perfect for that occasion. Hotel offers transfer to the Fair center by van. It's 5-10 min. of driving. I got very good price on www.booking.com and what I got is much better than what I paid. Breakfast is good enough. Room is almost perfect. Only remark is too small bathroom. Hotel stuff is professional. Buyukcekmece (the suburban of Istanbul) where actually hotel is situated is great place. Looks like touristic town with a plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops. Hotel is about 100m away from the seaside (Sea of Marmara). You can walk alongside the sea for kilometers. It was very pleasant and there were a lot of people walking. Istanbul city center is away more than 40km and if you go by taxi you would probably pay more than 60 EUR. There is better combination of transportation, if you have enough time - you catch local bus (100m away of hotel) no. 76c, get out on station Avgilar and catch metrobus 34 to station Zeytinburnu, there catch metro no. 1 to Aksaray and after that tramway going directly to Topkapi. You need 1,5-2 hours (it costs 4 EUR). Not good if you want to visit Istanbul everyday.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade, Serbia", "Title": "\u201cOK for conferences, lousy location\u201d", "Author": "Ana_na_putu", "ReviewID": "UR121125035", "Content": "Stayed for three-days conference, dacilities are decent, so are the rooms.

There's a nice sea view and it seems like the hotel is situated in a small town near Istanbul. I didn't get to try to the spa although I was told it was the biggest in Istanbul. However if you are using this hotel as a base to explore Istanbul then forget it, it's far and will take you too much time to get there. This is a strictly business type hotel in my opinion. Hotel offers good breakfast, rooms are good, staff are helpful, all in all a good experience but nothing special.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "apoplous", "ReviewID": "UR117352646", "Content": "Clean,nice area to stay,quiet,nice breakfast,clean", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiev, Ukraine", "Title": "\u201c5 star? it felt more like a 2 star plus hotel !\u201d", "Author": "urmilgohil", "ReviewID": "UR79464736", "Content": "Good price for the stay, the service was average to poor, the hotel is trying to be a high class 5 star hotel, however its more a 2-3 star hotel, with locals and Middle Eastern guest., very few westerners. do not book your airport transfer with the \" airport and tourism and travel agency\" the first one after arrivals for car rental, i paid them 70 euros for back and forward transport from Eser hotel, i had booked and paid for the transport from eser to the airport at 5 am - they never showed up and i had paid an extra 35 euros for the taxi,", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antalya", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, great service...\u201d", "Author": "rmdplzgm", "ReviewID": "UR79461102", "Content": "We enjoyed a lot...

I have been to several fairs in Tuyap Expo Center and stayed at several hotels. They were either expensive or lousy hotels. And don't get the idea that by paying much you get better service. Dedeman is a very well known hotel chain in Turkey (not so much by outsiders), this specific one is new in the chain. The new blood brought quality to the area, will book again in my next visit. Ask for upper levels so you can have a great sea view, also try fine dine roof restaurant. Fantastic view and great food. If you travel there in summer, the public beach is 50 meters walk, but it can get very crowded. Be sure to have a walk in B\u00c3\u00bcy\u00c3\u00bck\u00c3\u00a7ekmece Bay, sunset is exceptional. Several shopping malls, one historic bridge made by \"Mimar Sinan\", an aquapark with nice rides, some fish restaurants by the bay and some restaurants that serve local food from different areas of Turkey is all to see. I have heard of a complex with jeep driving ranges, water sports, picnic and BBQ facilities by the lake but never been there.
