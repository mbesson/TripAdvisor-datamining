Once you open the door you cannot get in the room is tiny and toilet even smaller. No hot water at all. I think they run on solar, when you ask they go rude. The breakfast was horrible, eggs come in by 8 or 8.30. I actually saw a small cockroach on their coffee machine. Did not even bother to complain as the guys were tight lipped. You go to their restaurant and the waiter there, smart looking with long hair things he is the customer he knows english very well but does not speak and talks in italian, hence i started talking in my lingo as well. My suggestion is guys please stay in the mainland and take a boat to san marco which is the only square nothing much to see as well. Please note there though you book your room as air conditioned, no ac is allowed until 01 april 2012. so had to open window and sleep.

It was my second stay at Albergo San Marco. The previous was in November 2009 for 4 nights with two friends ( rooms 208 and 406). This time I was with my daughter and we stayed for 3 nights in a superior room (114) on the first floor, overlooking the canal. I am always surprised when I read bad reviews of places I have enjoyed, and this hotel seems to have a few of those. However my experience is not at all negative. The personnel of the hotel were always very courteous. They speak different foreign languages quite fluently, but enjoy your trying to greet them at least in Italian, which I always do. I was able to print my travel documents ( free of charge ) on the printer attached to the computer in the lobby, and the receptionist helped me when one sheet of paper stuck in the printer at one point. Breakfast is good, plenty of choice: hot croissants, eggs, ham and cheese, different sorts of bread, cereals...etc....I have never been to Venice in the high season so I cannot say what it would be like then, in the frenzy of summertime; best avoided, probably. The room was large, very clean, furnished with period furniture, a good bed, and good heating. The bathroom was well equipped and spotless. Impeccable linen changed daily. I can imagine that it could be noisy. Despite our double glazing windows, we heard the workers in the street one morning. But when in Venice one wants to be up and about, visiting, not staying in bed all morning, so it did not disturb us. In conclusion, this second stay has convinced me that this hotel is a good choice; its location is superb, next to San Marco square, it has reasonable prices for Venice, and I would definitely stay there again on my next visit. I have stayed at two other hotels in Venice -Marconi on the Rialto - and Al Sole in San Polo- both were ok, but this one is equally good, in my opinion.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Innsbruck , Austria", "Title": "\u201cVery Good hotel just in the Heart of San Marco\u201d", "Author": "mehilba", "ReviewID": "UR121904383", "Content": "Overall a very good hotel , nice service , good breakfast.

Reception staff are not friendly nor helpful. A Continental breakfast is included. It is more than coffee/tea, juice and toasts. There is yogurt, scrambled eggs, fruits, cold cuts, cheeses and dry cereal. But quality of food is mediocre. The dining room is understaffed.

On our last day the flooding was so high it was up to our knees, all over the city. The hotel staff came to the apt with wellies, allowed us the use of the apt till we left in the afternoon, and staff could not have been more helpful. Breckfast was included in the price \u00c2\u00a3135 per night, and was great. Fruit/yougur/toast, cheese/ham/omlet. Tea, coffee, ask for hot chocolate if you want it. I really cant think of one reason why anyone could complain. St Marks square and Rialto are signposted wherever you go, so I would suggest either of these areas to stay in as no matter what time you came home, its possible to find your way back. We had bilinis at harrys bar as it was my birthday. 70euro for 5 drinks, 2 of which were non alcoholic versions for the kids. Delicious drink, but barely worth it other than to say youve been there. The bottled version is nothing campared to the original though I have to say, much as it agrieves me! This hotel was perfect, but we did have an apt and were not in the main building.

A canal and bridge is always 3 minutes walk and most hotels have a view of one. Yes - the shuttle bus does takes time - about 30 mins from Piazza de San Marco to the rlwy stn.

It's perfectly located, just a few steps from San Marco, the Vaporettos and the Vaporetto from the aiport - See below for some hints on some things - We got a good deal with Expedia, for 3 nights we got a room at 211euros, non refundable. A few days later the best price was something like 386euros for the same dates. Room (212) was a good sized room for European Standards, bathroom good sized also, an old fashioned hanging closet with normal hangers (not the wire kind !) with a valuable digit coded vault in it (this is good to have for your passport and things you don't want to carry around) plus a view on a small street. Breakfast is included, with croissant, pain au chocolat (chocolat like croissants), wrapped cakes (good to have for the munchie hour while visiting !), juices, cheese and cold cuts, bread, jams, butter, nutella (yum), etc. No eggs (darn). The bad part was that the windows were thin (pigeon flying would make it shake - am serious ). You could hear people talk (Italians can be loud), pigeons crooning, the bar downstairs, if you are a light sleeper (my husband heard nothing-lucky him-). But that's the only withdraw that I can think of. Personnel not very smiley, and say only what they have to say, not one word more ! If you want internet access, it'll cost you 10 euros for 1 hour- if you only need it for 15minutes, well, that's tought noogies on you ! OK things that are good to know while you are in Venice : From the airport, you can take the Vaporetto. There is a stand that sells them when you exit the customs area on the left. However they don't take Credit cards, only cash. For two people, two round trips cost 50 euros. BUT there is another ticket stand right by the Vaporetto and they take credit cards - had we known...The people that sell them aren't very happy-goers nor know how to smile. It's like they won't make an effort to help you, they are probably tired of all these tourist sand havent yet realized that it's a part of life....A taxi wil cost you an arm and a leg. You can alos take a bus, I think around 1 or 2 euros (had we knwon...) that take you to a Central station where you then take the Vaporetto to bring you closer to where you want to go...The Vaporetto is like their subway/bus system...When you are \"set-in\" you can walk to everything, takes time as you sometimes keep walking around in circles, easy to get lost. We bought a 12hour Vaporetto ticket in order to visit the islands: Murano, Burano (loved it the best) Lido (beach there)...wanted to do more but didn't have the time and the weather was wet and cold. Go tto Florian for coffee, capucino or hot chocolat and pastries...it's been there since the earth was created. Restaurants are to avoid : tourist traps. A must are Trattorias and Osterias - there are so many. Avoid, however, the ones where the waiters are waiting for you outside. On the bill you'll see that the bread is charged - can't avoid that unless you refuse the bread basket when they put it out it on the table. No tip necessary- already included - unless your waiter was really exceptionnal. You can go listen to Classic concerts, sometimes they sell ticket outside of churches, or around schools, or main areas such as San Marco place. You buy a ticket earlier that day or right before that night show (if space still available, that is). A good Venice cocktail (to my taste) is the SPRITZ has a little of sparkling wine, mixed with sparkling water, Campari and a zest of lemon or orange. Delicious Gelati - all over - 2 big scoops cost 2euros. For lunch, you might want to grab a sandwich \"Venitian style\" and eat while walking around (not on San Marco place: eating, loitering not allowed ) alot of Venitians do that for lunch - lots of varieties, and also pizzas (if you want it hot, you can ask) cost is around 3euros50 a sandwich, and the prices are the same everywhere, whether you're at San Marco ro lost in the middle of nowhere. A good place to munch in is in a Wine Bar - they have varieties of food (a bit like Spanish Tappas) and you can nibble on everything (you pay of course ! ) while having the choice of wine (sweet, strong, white, red, rose..). Don't buy mask or souvenirs with street sellers, you can find much better in the shops. There are good Murano glass items such as rings, pendants, glasses, vases, ashtrays - everywhere also ! Good visiting, eating, drinking, shopping. We'll go back when it's dry and warm !", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cBig rooms, great beds and BEST location ever\u201d", "Author": "Pereira01", "ReviewID": "UR24165035", "Content": "Its really easy to get lost in Venice, and i can assure you maps are no big help in this unique city.

A little hard to find from the vaparetto and, as with any Venice hotel, be prepared to schlep your luggage up and down over the steps of multiple canals. It's easy to get lost, but you never get bored going the same way twice. The hotel was clean - not cheap, but it seems like all hotels in Venice are expensive in the summer. It was worth it to stay right in Venice as opposed to a nearby place like Mestre. It's nice to walk or boat around throughout the day and into the night. What I wanted to specifically point out was something that the hotel offered, more so than something about the hotel itself. When we checked in, the front desk staff asked what we wanted to see in Venice. When we told him that we planned to go to Murano to see the famous glass blowing and glass items, he said that the hotel offered a FREE tour that meets at 9am the next morning in the lobby (not sure if this is offered everyday, but it was on the Thursday we were there). So we went downstairs the next morning at 9am and we were the only ones there. The front desk guy assured us that the tour would go on with just us. A nicely-dressed guy from off the street walked into the lobby to pick us up and walk us to a private water taxi. He found the right guy in his water taxi, hastily dropped us off, and we never saw him again. We got into the water taxi and we had concerns, because we had been told how expensive water taxis were. However, our experience was perfectly fine, as he was able to cut through some narrow canals that the vaparetto can't fit through and we got to Murano island in less than 10 minutes. He didn't ask for any money - we gave him a few euros as a tip. As soon as we got to the glass blowing factory, a representative of the factory met us and whisked us into his factory - we never saw the water taxi guy again. After we watched a demonstration, we were toured us through a very fancy gallery with very expensive pieces. No pressure to buy, but if we did, you could be sure that the water taxi guy, the \"walker\", and even the hotel front desk guy would all get a kick-back. When we finished there, we walked around Murano and took the vaparetto back to San Marcos on our own. I'm sure if we made a big purchase, they would have gladly sent another private water taxi to bring us back near the hotel. While the hotel was fine, I thought that it was most important to comment about this Murano tour, since many people might be interested but might be concerned. In the end, it was all above-board, it was FREE, and we enjoyed it despite our concerns as we saw it all transpire. Other than saving a few euros for the vaparetto, it absolutely got us to Murano much faster than any other method of transportation. Go to Murano!

We found the charm and convience of this hotel delightful and would definately stay here again, but would always email ahead for a larger ,or again, a corner room as some of the rooms can be rather small,as a lot are in Venice.On the whole I would thoughly recommend this hotel, if you want to be staying in the heart of Venice you could find no better location.", "Date": "October 19, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Best Western Albergo San Marco", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d202709-Reviews-Best_Western_Albergo_San_Marco-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$237 - $522*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piazza San Marco 877</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30124</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "202709", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a7/a0/a7a0f3adf1edad06aa1f1d5d5420cfb42large.jpg"}}
