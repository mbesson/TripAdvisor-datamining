We were not able to find any hotels online, anywhere near the Taksim, for a reasonable price...so we booked at the Conti. Here are the facts: -Conti is located in a side street that is semi-residential -Conti is 2 metro stops away from Taksim square. -The front desk staff are OK, but not very helpful and their english is very basic -A previous review mentioned A/C not working....and sure enough, our room A/C did not work...it blew warm air out, in July!. They gave us a fan and appologized. -Rooms, are very very small. The bed takes most of the room. So when we went to taksim square I saw a bunch of very nice hotels, that were not listed on travelocity, expedia, or tripadvisor....and they were at the same rate at the Conti!!! We checked-out immediatly and moved to Takim square. Lesson learned: Look hard online for hotels in Taksim square and you will find something at the same rate, if not better, as the Conti.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cConti spectacular\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5465285", "Content": "I stayed at the Conti for 6 nights with my girlfriend. We can both agree that this was a spectacular surprise. We got more than we had hoped for. The rooms were slick, clean, modern, and comfortable. I recommend asking for a room facing the Football stadium as it is a quitter than the other side...if your window is open. AC in every room. Breakfast was on the top floor so we were able to start our day with an amazaing view of the Bosphorus, even better was having dinner up there, it looked as if Istanbul was one big Christmas tree. The room service was quick, and everyone spoke or made an effort to speak english. Everytime we left the hotel, we were offered a taxi, water to bring with us, maps, directions, anything at all. The location was really good, it is really close to malls, and not far by taxi to the markets. I would recommend this hotel, to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, quiet stay in Istanbul. Even buisness travelers, as they are fully equiped for fax/conference/email/ and all that jazz.", "Date": "July 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel,Bad service would not stay again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4103405", "Content": "ive stayed in this hotel once before and the service we recieved was fine, however this time the service was inaqdequate for the price you pay for the hotel, i would recommend anyone who wants a hotel in this region to go to the surmeli hotel which is5 star and 5 minutes walk from this one. They gave us a room which was alot smaller and basic than the last one. the reception did not have a clue about what they were doing,could not sleep due to the work going on and the noise, they moved us later to another room which they had not booked correctly, so we again had to move over to the surmeli hotel. Room service takes 1 hour to recieve a meal..which arrives cold..breakfast is very very basic. Overall would never go again there are many hotels in taxim squeare which are great location,and many other 5 stars that will cost you same price. very unproffesional approach to customer, you recieve service according to your nationality. not recommended.", "Date": "November 10, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Istanbul Conti", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d296629-Reviews-Istanbul_Conti-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$81 - $263*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Ortaklar Caddesi 30</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Mecidiyekoy</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">80290</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "296629", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5e/ca/5eca84f97db983020b3e7b97a6d79b2e3large.jpg"}}
