A few minutes walk from Kings Cross and a short walk to Woburn Street with all its busses to all parts of London. Staff could not have been friendlier. It is a no frills hotel so we had to borrow (at no extra cost) a hairdrier, and there was no lift which may or may not be a problem.as the hotel only had three floors.

I've used it on a number of occasions, most recently in May 2011. It is conveniently sited within 5 minutes walk of King's Cross Station - though taxi drivers sometimes grumble because it's only a short \"fare\". The major hurdle for me, as someone who is mildly disabled, is the absence of a lift, but a request for a ground floor room for that cause is met without question whenever possible. The rooms vary in size and outlook, which is unavoidable in a building of this age, but I've never found it to be anything less than spotless and the staff are always professional. Though the standard of their friendliness does vary, I've never met anything approaching rudeness, and most are very helpful. Breakfast is a mixture of buffet and cooked, though the breakfast room could be a little bigger and can get a bit crowded sometimes. The biggest issue in finding somewhere in London is price, followed by and linked to locale and facilities. The kind of hotel that has a lift and room service is in a different price bracket; if I were staying in London for any length of time, I'd probably go to somewhere with more facilities and then grumble about the cost. If one's stay is no more than one through three nights then this is fair choice. For the price bracket that the Mentone is in, then it has the level of facilities that are usual, and overall is significantly better than average. I've stayed in places in this price-range that were nowhere near as pleasant. In the end, your experience will come down to expectation. If you expect a three or four star hotel, you'll not find it here; but if a one-to-two star guest house will meet your needs, then you will be more than satisfied.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cCosy friendly spot at a superconvenient location\u201d", "Author": "indipendente", "ReviewID": "UR119160375", "Content": "This is a small hotel 5 min. from St Pacras, which is great if you are coming to London by Eurostar.

In all, the Mentone is a no-frills establishment that isn't terrible, but it seems to have lost its competitive edge compared to other budget hotels on the same street. Rooms were generally in good physical condition (nice paint, redone bathrooms, recessed lighting), but there is a lack of attention to small details. Rooms come with just one flimsy towel and one tiny soap bar. There is no luggage rack, no guest information book, no Do Not Disturb sign, no pen and paper, no fan or A/C, or any other small amenities that you've come to expect from a regular hotel. If you aren't on the top floor, then be prepared to hear lots of creaking overhead at night from the people above you. Beds were firm and in good condition. The Wi-Fi worked in two of the rooms we were in but there was zero signal in another room. The hotel consists of 3 townhouses with very steep stairs joined together on the ground floor. The decoration in the rest of the hotel is minimal and the hallways are dark at night. The depressing basement breakfast room is too small so you'll need to wait if you go right before breakfast ends. The staff wasn't rude but was generally apathetic and they clearly weren't professionally trained in hospitality. Thus I can't say that our stay was necessarily bad, but I highly recommend checking out the other budget hotels that also share the same row of townhouses on Carthwright Gardens (the George Hotel, the Euro, the Harlingford, the Euro).

They said they would \"look at it\". Maybe they did, but they took no action , even though I was there for a week. They turn off the heating in the daytime, which made matters worse. It was unbearably cold between breakfast time and early evening. Speaking of breakfast, the breakfast room was inadequate. People had to queue all the way up the staircase outside to get a table, as breakfast was only being served for 90 minutes a day. Having said that, the food (when you could get it) was acceptable, and the workers did their best to cope with the crowd of irritated guests. The walls of the rooms are paper-thin, which provides no privacy and makes them very noisy. I could hear every word my neighbours were saying in their room. Also, the hotel's website says it accepts credit cards, but the agency I booked through told me I had to pay in cash when I booked. But I guess that, since they had the \"hotel full\" notice at the entrance up all the time I was there, they do not care about their poor quality. In summary, I read the reviews before I went there.

Firstly, the beds are extremely uncomfortable - very hard and unyielding. The sheets are clean but show signs of wear. The other bed linen (duvet, quilt) were clean but worn and stained. The bathroom does not have an extractor fan and the knob on the cold water tap kept falling off. There was no bar fridge provided. Finally, while the meals staff were lovely, neither of the two Reception people we encountered were particularly friendly or helpful.", "Date": "November 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201ccan't go wrong for the price\u201d", "Author": "AJP-Tokyo", "ReviewID": "UR6013358", "Content": "Free wi-fi, breakfast included.

I would never go back - the walls are paper thin and the noise in the hotel is dreadful. Our first room stank of smoke and was a bed and a half rather than a double, so we asked to be moved. The second room was only slightly better - there was no hand towel in the bathroom and nowwhere to fix the shower handle to, so it meant bathing all the time or trying to hold the shower handle. The bed was terrible - I could feel the springs in the mattress and the pillows were lumpy. The breakfast wasn't great either, and on weekdays they only serve until 9, 9.30 at the weekends. It definitely didn't seem like a 3 star hotel to me, and for \u00a3250 you should be able to get something better.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, England", "Title": "\u201cCheap, Cheerful and Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "JackRoy", "ReviewID": "UR5511124", "Content": "Good location with easy access to Kings Cross/St Pancras Station or Russell Square.
