We had a 6:45 AM flight out of Montreal to NYC and needed a hotel close to airport. When leaving hotel to airport the next morning the whole hotel had a smell of VOMIT. I liked the free parking form my rental car. Otherwise their Holiday Inn a mile down was probably on par or maybe even better. The had to check out the pool after seeing the photos on Tripadvisor. What a let down! It really looked much smaller in person. I paid $79 and that may have been a bit excessive. The room was small and probably worth more like $59 per night.

This was our first time visit to Montreal (me and my girlfriend), so we thought we cashed in the voucher before it expired. What we loved: - We were worried when we got there that it would be tough finding someone who spoke English, but from the girl who checked us in at the desk, to the banquet porter/room server, to the bartender, everyone spoke perfect English and delivered exceptional service. I requested a drink from the bartender on Friday afternoon, and though he did not have one ingredients for my drink, he found a clever substitute which made for a tasty drink. - we loved the room we were placed in, a king room on the sixth floor. The art style was excellent (though i know some who may not like it), not a single imperfection could be found on my part. The TV, the bed, bathroom, chair all top scores with us. - The peace and quiet was what we were looking for on this trip, and we got it throughout our stay. The lobby area was perfect for catching up on reading, the gym was peaceful for a great workout, and though we had an adjoining room any noise from our neighbor we could not hear (Were not saying that walls are soundproof, just we had a quiet neighbor). Minor issues I found: - When we checked in we found multiple cups in the hallway that would remain there till the morning. The room service tray we put out one night was next to our door early in the morning. I think the room service staff should remove trays and cups each night. - Location near winding and confusing roads in the area turned us off, not on the Crown Plaza, but to that part of Montreal. Didn't help we were first timers who spoke no french though. Thank god I had my GPS or we would have been lost for sure. - Wanted to get some chips and a KitKat from the gift ship there but it was closed. Went to speak to the guest services representative to ask when the shop would open, and she said the woman who runs it keeps unusual hours so she did not know when it would open again. We ended up waiting about 5 hours until it opened in the evening to get some snacks. Setting regular hours for the gift shop would be something to look into.

They said a shuttle would be there in five minutes and it was. Shuttle driver also spoke fluent English. I realize that I am in a 'foreign' country as a guest, but it is really nice to be accommodated by EVERYONE in my own language. No problems at check in, very helpful. Everything I saw was in tip-top shape, if anything I would say this place is underpriced. The room had all the little touches that make the difference between just a place and a nice place. (I see that someone commented about the view ... you are in a city, a few minutes from the airport. Sorry, there aren't mountains, water and trees) I don't see the restaurant listed on Trip Advisor so I'll include it here. I had the lasagna, it was good ... I ate it all including all the sauce and all the bread with no room for soup, salad or deserts. The restaurant looked more like an event center with the high ceilings and rows of tables.

Nice soundproofing of windows; on the 4th floor, I could not hear any of the steady traffic on Cote de Liesse. Efficient check-in and check-out. Free parking. Easy access to highways 40 (east/west) and 15 (north/south). Fantastic pool area; loved the slide. The young bartender Francois at Bar Connexion was terrific. Cons: For rooms with connecting doors, expect to hear every word spoken on the TV or in the room next door due to poor soundproofing around these doors. Alas, I had some obnoxious women next door who were clearly inebriated by 8pm. No fridge or microwave in the room; I presume the locked cabinet contained these.

A Dorval Airport property. The first thing I look for, once I've gotten past basic safety, cleanliness, and decor, is the availability of a convenient electrical outlet for my laptop. This renovated room fails the test -- no electrical plug by the bed, none along the wall beside the bed. Fortunately, I brought an extension cord and was able to jerry rig some power from the electrical plug built-in to the desk light. I'm using it to write this review.

Not what you usually associate with the Crowne Plaza brand. The only chair in the room is the desk chair -- the room is probably too small for an easy chair, so it's not great for curling up with a book, or watching TV from a comfortable chair. For those of you bringing your earthly treasures, there's an in-room safe. There also appears to be a locked honor bar. And, there's a bottle of something on the bed. Inspection reveals that it is a bottle of linen mist, presumably for inducing some kind of aromatherapeutic state prior to slumber. The carpets in the hallway are a strangely disturbing red-grey combo with some circley things along one side only. Do not attempt to navigate the hallway while intoxicated or on strong medications. Perhaps the in-room linen mist helps overcome the disorientation caused by walking the hallway. In the elevator waiting area, there's a blast of air from a vent in the wall that easily equals the ones used to dry a car in a car wash.
