Having visited more than a few similar places through my work over the years, I am delighted to share the Melia Castilla evolved as one of the real stars for mid-sized conferences. First, the hotel is highly accessible, being located only half an hour taxi away from the airport. Yet is has a inner city location. The initial impression was that the interior is perhaps a bit aged, indicating the hotel is not in the luxury league where everything has to be (or at least look) brand new. For the purpose of a good business trip, however, and certainly for a smaller conference, the hotel is still elegant from top to toe and absolutely superb in its category. It is also a pleasure to note that the high professionalism of the staff I met harmonised with the same high standards. Details which caught my attention included the excellent cleanliness everywhere, quiet (although small) rooms - in which you can even open the window to ventilate. However beware of traffic noise outside. The great breakfast buffet especially the meats and fruits section, and availability of elegant armchairs and couches in public areas. From a meeting point of view the plenary room for some 500 people was sophisticated and well equipped - all seats had microphones and own spotlights. The overall basement architecture (i.e. the meeting area) had the same elegance as the rest of the hotel, including top service. I personally liked the compartmentalisation of the meeting area, making it interesting and enjoyable to walk around between meeting rooms. Best of all, after the conference day you just take the lift up to your room. Anyone who has been to major congresses, with sometimes miles to walk from their hotels, will love this asset. Last but not least, there are multiple stylish board rooms in well secluded sections for confidential and undisturbed team meetings. Again, if you have experienced team rooms in venues with background noise from next door ongoing lectures, you will really appreciate this place.

We were staying at Melia for a conference and I did love the place--the room was beautiful, if a little small, the bath amenities very nice (not quite L'Occitane, but very good), and prompt service from anyone and everyone. The conference facilities were great and very convenient. Water on the tables, pens, paper--all the usual things you expect. We really did love the breakfast buffet. I stay at many hotels whose prices include breakfast, and this was one of the top ones anywhere. Station after station with fresh breads and pastries of every sort; a vast array of cold meats and cheeses and smoked fish; many types of fruit; hot dishes of all sorts; and fresh omlettes to order. Fresh squeezed oj and Cava if you wanted a mimosa. If you are accustomed to \"pigs on parade\" at buffets, where everyone scarfs all the food and there is none left, you can forget about this malady at Melia. What was most astounding was that regardless of how close it was to the end of the meal time, the staff kept refreshing the platters. The most expensive cheeses and jamon were always replenished and you could not begin to try everything available. Now, to my two complaints. First, every hotel that rips off its patrons for Internet needs a sound smack down. I am still seeing this at many high end hotels and it has got to stop. Internet is now as ubiquitous as ironing boards in rooms and business hotels should quit dumping on the patrons for this. Second, I did not appreciate that the price per night shot up for the days of the conference by 45 EUR additional. I have to say that this practice of not extending the lower rate to the conference attendees for the duration of the stay is not something I have seen anywhere I go. I travel all over the world for conferences and there are never two prices. Also, while many hotels do complimentary upgrades, if you wanted a larger room, you had to shell out yet another 30 EUR per night. Other than this, the distance from the action was not particularly troublesome since the Metro was close by.

The coffee bar in the lobby and it's staff were helpful and served good coffee. They serve a very good buffet breakfast (though you should order real coffee separately). On the down side, few staff spoke English, the location was not ideal for sightseeing but as this was a conference venue, the metro was only a short walk away and easily commutable. Taxis are easily available outside the hotel and throughout the city. This was my first visit to Madrid and I would highly recommend it as a wonderful relaxed and walkable city with excellent bars, restaurants and some notable cultural sites!

I was fortunate to have a first floor room which was super as the wi fi from the conference halls extended up to this level. Thus I did not need to buy the ethernet cable in the minibar. With the strength of the euro the minibar prices are pretty awful. 15 euros for three cokes is really outrageous but every traveller should know to go out and buy snacks in the nearest seven eleven. This hotel is central but Madrid is a big city. It is a long walk to the Prado although the metro is very good. In the area of Melia Castila the main buildings are apartments or banks. There are very few places to eat or any obvious supermarkets. Spanish is a dominant language even in the capital and you need to speak to someone below 30 if your main travel language is English. Madrid is a typical Mediterranean city witha very long part ofthe day where every facility closes. Unlike France it tends to last longer and most businesses and the traffic only pick up again at 5pm. The traffic is horrendous and I wouldn't hire a car in Madrid. You only need to look at all the dents and some of the driving! For Madrid in business or pleasure this is a great choice.

I treated us to a 5 star hotel in Spain; but the hotel is NOT 5 star quality. I had let the hotel know by email that we would be late and needed another bed and 2 twin beds, not a king. When we arrived, there was no one to retrieve our luggage and I had to park my own car (another insult was the $27 euro charge for 10 hours at the car park). I was traveling with my 26 year old son, 16 year old niece and me, a seasoned over 50 traveler. When I went to the desk, the staff ignored me (I'm a woman in Madrid after all). The room, although large and having a nice bathroom, had a king bed, not 2 twins (none were available) and the rollaway was much to small and very uncomfortable. But nothing compared to the bed of granite, it did not move when you sat on it. That might satisfy the monk or some one who travels with a bed board, but my back was in great pain the next day (my niece as well). Then, when we went out to dinner, there were hookers at every corner, yes they were upscale hookers (not scantily clad), but still I did not enjoy having to expose my niece to that experience (my son was approached by one the next day and they must have thought my niece was competition, since one of them told her to move on!). There is a great fish restaurant right down the block, however, where we had a lovely meal. When we returned, it was to discover that the internet is locked in the 20th century and there was no possibility of logging onto any sites (this was a common topic of communication with almost every english speaking guest). The next morning, I spent over 1.5 hours trying to get the staff to change our room, they kept on ignoring my requests, hanging up on me and then not answering the phone when we called the manager. I had discovered on the 2 minutes that I could get on line that the hotel had a newly refurbished area with latex mattresses. I finally had my husband call from the states and he alerted us around 1:00 pm that they had agreed to move us to the newer section of the hotel. We then enjoyed our day in Madrid (but with those painful backs), only to discover when we returned that not only had they not moved our room, but that they had done nothing. I must say that I lost it in the lobby, announcing to all and sundry that the hotel mistreated its guests. The manager finally then came up to me and sneering, he basically told me that nothing could be done (of course, it was now over midnight and too late to book another hotel). I wanted to leave but my son reminded me that it was only for one more night. What the hotel then did was give us around 15 pillows over the bed to sleep on. I will say that the pillow menu was nice. The manager had been sweating because I reminded him that having hookers across the hotel is not 5 star quality. He offered us drinks and we parted cordially. Overall, don't go if you enjoy the Marriott, Sheridan or Hilton type beds, comfy, but supportive. The beds in most of the hotel are major under par, as is the possibility of having to view hookers; on the plus side, the rooms are very large, well lit, clean, the bathrooms are very large, there are good toiletries, and the breakfast (included in the booking.com cost) was very expansive, delicious and they also made eggs for you on request. Do not park in the underground parking next to the hotel, it is rip off city. You can park on the street overnight, but have to get up early and move the car or feed the meter. If you rely on the Internet and don't have a fancy plan where you don't have to rely on the hotel supplied internet, this is not the hotel for you. It is about 10 minutes by car (I am a veteran NYC, Naples city driver) to the center of the city, in a generally good area. The swimming pool is an added plus (outdoors, not heated), but it is only open for a few hours and there is no fitness room. Booking.com got me a good rate, but in retrospect, I should have booked at the Hilton, free parking, free internet and great beds. Also, if your trip to Madrid will involve tapas, late night eats, shopping and museums, there are much better, but more expensive hotels in the centro, like the Westin Palace or the Urban.

I have developed friendships and have a bit of an allegiance to this hotel. Pros: We are fortunate to stay on the 15th floor, also know as their Servicio Real. It is an additional 30euro per night over the rack rate. Included in the rate is an open bar at night on the floor, breakfast on the 15th floor and a dedicated receptionist as well. If you prefer, you can dine at the ample buffet downstairs, which is included with the price. The service is amazing. The staff is attentive, housekeeping is prompt, and everyone greets you. I don't know if this is a function of the 15th floor, but it seems consistent throughout the hotel. The beds are in good shape, fairly comfortable. Cons: No gym. I stay here a lot, and that is a huge frustration. You can walk one block to the Hotel Cuzco and use theirs for 7euro. I also have found a nice park to run in with chin-up bars fresh air not too far away either (run away from downtown on Castillana, past the new skyscrapers just built, and turn left at the hospital. In two blocks you will find a park entrance.) It is getting pretty tired; the luster is fading on this jewel. The carpets are showing wear, the decor and design are circa 1972. There is enough gold and mirrors in the lobby and restaurant to give you vertigo. To their credit .. the gold and mirrors are polished and spotless. The location is pretty removed. I don't mind the walk downtown, but it will take you 45 mins to get to the Plaza Mayor. On a nice day, there is nothing more relaxing ... and it is all downhill, but it is a hike.

We checked in and everything was great , we got a nice room and our bags were delivered to our room within 10 minutes. From then on unfortunately the stay in the hotel went down hill. We were only staying from the 5th until the 9th and to be honest we were happy to leave then as we did not feel comfortable at all staying there. We were on one occasion screamed at by pool staff across the pool. I had left my sunbed to go to my room and get something, as my towel had blown into the pool the life gaurd and pool attendant must of put my book between the mattress and the sun bed to make sure this did not blow in also. When i came back they saw me looking for my book, both of them proceeded to scream at me in spanish trying to tell me where the book was. Unfortunately i do not speak Spanish so i couldn't understand, they stood at the other side of the pool and screamed at me for a good 10 minutes, getting quite annoyed because i couldnt understand what they were trying to say, if they had simply walked around and showed me where they had but the book this would of be fine but at this stage the gentleman behind the bar started to scream also in spanish. It was obvious i couldnt understand and i was mortified as everyone else around the pool was looking at me, i had to leave the pool area. Eventually a guest with very little english in the pool told me that the meant the book was under the mattress. I was very embarrassed as they made me feel quite stupid, for a 5 star hotel this is not really they way i expect to be treated. On another occasion my friend took out grapes to eat on her sun lounger and another life gaurd came over and told us very abruptly to put them away as there was a sign saying \"no eating\". There was no sign anywhere around the pool first of all, no sign anywhere outside and i had seen 2 other Spanish people eat beside the pool, and i would be quite sure the pool staff had seen them also. He again had very very little English so i could not explain this to him. From then on the pool staff did nothing but stare at us and point at us throughout the time we sat around the pool. When we were leaving , a security gaurd hovered around us in reception while waiting for our taxi and walked beside my friend right through reception as if she was being ascourted out of the building. When i got outside with my bags, it was obvious we were struggling and my case fell down a few steps and i lost control, my friend dropped her bags to help me but not one of the 2 porters who were standing there beside us even tried to help. I wouldn't say i was expecting to much off the hotel and the fact it was 5 stars i would of thought they would of gone over and above to help or assist there guests. I found that the fact i didn't speak the language was a hindrance and this is why i could not point it out to management because i had no energy to try and have a conversation where they couldn't understand our language or point of view. I was a bit upset leaving , it was if we had acted quite rude towards them that they were doing the same with us. I am aware it is hard to communicate when you do not know the language but this was really not the problem. I really don't know what to say about this, i did find the hotel expensive but i fully understand this goes with a 5 star hotel and i wouldnt complain about that even though a can of coke at the pool was 6 euro and a mixed salad was 19 Euro.

The staff may be multi-lingual, but their arrogance and rudeness translates into any language.

When we called the front desk looking for an iron the night before conducting a formal presentation, they simply said no, with absolutely no effort toward problem-solving. As for the touted offerings of the Melia's various restaurants, we found them to be completely overpriced, at fully three times the rates of nice restaurants we had eaten in nearer to Madrid's city center. (The minibar offers $5 cans of soda!) From the Melia's location, Madrid's museums and evening-terraza fun are completely inaccessible without involving a 20 min. ride on the Metro subway. The local restaurants/tapas bars are not worth mentioning, which forces you to partake of the overpriced hotel-centered services.

It never deserved the 5 stars, more 4 star standard. The hotel is something from 1970, at least the rooms look like. The staff is very arrogant and not very helpful. Already in the first night one tupe broke down and the whole bathroom was under water. At least we could say that the breakfast was very good, plenty things to choose. It ssems that this 1000 bed hotel is being filled up with tourists during weekends to make it more rentable. Even as members of the Sol Melia Mas Program we felt being treatened like that. We had been in a lot of other Melia Hotels, mostly 4 stars. Each of them were much better than the Melia Castilla. For us the location was not that problem. Public transport ist very good, bus and metro stations very close and within 20 minutes you are in downtown. So, price is not everything! Better choose the AC Hotel 100 meters away.

If you're in Madrid for the weekend though have a look at Melia and Trypp's other hotels nearer to the city centre. Good pool in summertime although its a bit cold.
