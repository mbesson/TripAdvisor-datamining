This is not a 5 star hotel and if you know that already - then you will be pleased. Please don't expect 5-star service like bell-hops or people waiting on you. The breakfast was really filling: quite enjoyed them! Juices, cereals, yoghurts, fresh buns, meat, cheese, etc - very nice - even with table linens and linen napkins!

We are usually lower class travelers, frequenting (nice) hostels and budget hotels, but due to our late plans and lack of available rental cars, we had to take the cheapest option in Venice (other available options were 300+ Euros). For the price, and according to the reviews, we at least expected a nice hotel. The location is not bad, a short walk from a waterbus station and in a central area with an abundance of restaurants and bars. As most (probably all) Venice hotels, it is in a tight and very old building without an elevator, which could be expected. The room was tiny with hardly any room to open your suitcase, but even that was expected. Our complaints come from the rest of the amenities/facilities. Starting with the cleanliness, the room was way under par. There were cobwebs on the lamps, it was dusty, and there was a bar of soap (not far) under the bed. The bathroom wasn't cleaned well on the second morning of our stay. Even the sheets were less than perfectly cleaned. The bathroom was spacey (almost as big as the rest of the room) but there was no shower curtain, so taking a shower flooded the floor. At first there was no water pressure, because the hose from the faucet to the showerhead had numerous holes. After complaining, it was changed, fixing the pressure problem, but it should have been done before we came in. I'll remark that this is a 5 euro hose, nothing fancy, and it was obviously broken long before but never replaced. The bathroom problems continued the second morning when after showering we found out we were given tiny towels instead of regular bath towels like we were given the day before. There was a television in the room - actually a computer monitor - but there was no remote control and I was unable to turn it on manually, making me suspect that it too was dysfunctional. Being in Venice we didn't need tv, so I didn't complain to the receptionist. The beds were two singles pushed together with separate sheets and douvets. They were on wheels and so separated when lying in the middle. \"luckily\", the room was too small to have the gap wide enough to fall into :). And then comes the breakfast. It was horrid. Terrible coffee (in Italy!). You actually had to pay an extra 3-4 euros for an egg! The night before we payed 65 Euros in Verona (hotel brandoli) and had a great breakfast. Why can't they at least match the quality when charging over 3 times as much? I forgot to mention that the ancient plumbing meant you had to wait 2-3 minutes between toilet flushes. We complained about this and were told that that's how it is in Venice. The staff was okay. The lady there on the first night was nice and recommended places to eat, etc. But the guy there on the second night was very unhelpful. To summarize-choose a different hotel when staying in Venice. This place would have been acceptable at 50 euros a night, but for 200 euros this was a dump!", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canterbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHotel Pantalon is a disaster -a health disaster! Do not stay there!\u201d", "Author": "workaway26", "ReviewID": "UR104471533", "Content": "My work sent me to Venice for a week, and the hotel seemed nice from the photos and suited the budget allowance. I read some negative reviews about the small room sizes but was positive to not let this ruin any free time around work, that I may have. HOWEVER- the reviews failed to mention the following points which I had to endure during the weeks stay and feel it essential to mention the following: 1- Fleas in the bed- I was eaten alive during the night and woke up almost every hour itching. I thought perhaps it was in my mind but my legs and arms and tummy have the bite marks and red swells to prove it. It was not mosquitos either because the bites were different and I wascareful to not leave windows open etc. 2- Ants all over the floor- there were a large number of ants coming through the cracks in the walls at the base of the wall where it meets the floor. I couldnt walk around the room without rolling my trousers up. Nothing could be left on the floor i.e suitcase because there were so many everywhere. 3- the staff were very unfriendly and unhelpful-despite what other reviews say 4- I have travelled a fair bit, and I have never been to a hotel where you are not allowed to take the room key out with you. every time you leave the hotel the staff ask you to leave the key with them. Ok fair enough thats their rules, BUT I returned one day to find there was no one on the reception or door, AND all the room keys had been left on the side within easy reach of anyone passing by wanting to raid the rooms and steal items. It was a security nightmare and I did not appreciate this. 5- NOT ONCE was my room cleaned, despite the fact I did see cleaning staff everyday. I asked them to clean my room , but all they did was \"make the bed\" in a fashion. They did not change the bed sheets ALL week, or provide clean towels or toilet rolls. I had to raid their cupboard which was near my room to get clean towels. 6-The hotel is located in the back alleys which are lovely to explore during the daytime but as a female traveller I did not feel safe when it got dark. There were lots of fights and arguments between the locals during the evening as the hotel is not in the main tourist strip. The noise is echoed by the alley location. 7- There is no lift and no one helped with bags (although this is not a major issue compared with the other points) 8-The rooms are very small. I was lucky in that sense as I could at least walk around my bed, but another English couple could not. They stayed just one night but because I had paid for the week up front, I was stuck. 9-There was a terrible smell from the hallway and breakfast areas which to me smelt like wet dogs. Pets are allowed in this hotel so bare this in mind when visiting. Overall the experience was dirty and a complete waste of money. I am not a stuck up traveller by any means, but this was certainly not average standard. It served a purpose and is cheaper than most places, but if cheap equals fleas, ants and rudeness, I would have preferred to pay a little bit more! The only positive point is that it isnt far from the bus station and the continental breakfast is edible. Take into account everything before visiting this place.

The Pantalon is a very short walk from the San Toma Vaporetto stop which is served by the express (#2) line from the train station. YOU MUST, ABSOLUTELY MUST print off the map on the hotel's website if you want any chance of finding the hotel easily from the vaporetto stop. This is Venice, after all, so it's not because this hotel is any harder to find that any other place in the city. Everything in Venice can be difficult to locate! There is no elevator in the Pantalon (not unusual for Venice) and all of the rooms are located up a long, high flight of stairs. The rooms were extremely small, definitely the tiniest of any of the three hotels that we stayed in during our trip to Italy. We booked a quiet double, and while the room faced the interior, we still heard plenty of street sounds, so ear plugs are a must if you're a light sleeper. The bathroom was bare bones, with no shower curtain and pretty low water pressure. Just put a lot of towels down and you'll be fine. The key to the in-room safe and the remote control to the television could be had for a 20 EURO deposit. Breakfast was a selection of juices, cereal, and cold rolls with a variety of spreads. For a few extra EUROs, if you were so inclined, you could purchase a selection of various hot foods. The location of the hotel was fairly good. Venice as a whole is fairly tiny, although it can take a long time to walk from Point A to Point B because there are very few streets that are direct and unimpeded by a rio.

The morning and nighttime desk clerks were fairly unfriendly but were helpful if you needed assistance. The afternoon clerk was excellent though, recommending some incredible places to eat that were definitely known and frequented primarily by locals, and giving us some shortcuts to help us navigate.

I could have shook the neighbour's hand as we smoked on the tiny balcony. This is real Venice. There is a church nearby and it does ring it's bells every day. Again, if you want to sleep away your time in Venice, that's up to you. The room was tiny but had everything we needed for a four day stay. Plenty of wardobe and drawer space. I don't go in for cat-swinging whilst on holiday. The only real problem was if one person is trying to enter or leave the bathroom whilst the other is stood at the wardrobe, but how much of a problem is that? The bathroom was funny as well. It had the obligatory bidet but everything got soaked as there was no shower curtain. It was obviously not designed to be a wet room but that was how the owners had it so no use worrying about the possible damage. I just spread all the towels around after I had finished with them and let them soak all the water up. The walls were paper thin but people did seem to realise this and kept the noise down. This will be the same just about everywhere in the world except airport hotels.The safe in the room was a laugh, I could open it with my nail, but, hey-ho, nothing got stolen. For those needing regular tea/coffee, take your own kettle and this will save you a fortune. There is a small food shop around the corner on the way to Sa Toma Vaporetto stop with a lovely Trattoria opposite. Sorted. This does exactly what it says on the tin. For those not wanting anything more than a clean and comfortable bed for the night, somewhere to shower, a light bite before facing the world, then this is it. The next time I go back to Venice, I will check this hotel's prices first.", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cA genuine Venetian experience\u201d", "Author": "SirPeder", "ReviewID": "UR18819717", "Content": "I visited Venice with a friend in mid-June and wanted a centrally located, but still reasonably priced hotel, and decided to try the Hotel Pantalon - a decision we never regretted. The hotel is situated a short (and straight) walk south of the Piazzale Roma, where the airport express bus terminates. You have to look carefully to spot the hotel sign, as the building itself is an old Venetian townhouse which merges beautifully with its surroundings. Walking to Rialto or Accademia will take you 10-15 minutes at the most, and the neighbourhood provides lots of opportunities to explore and \"get lost\" in the narrow streets. As the rest of Venice, the area felt completely safe, even late at night. We occupied a room on the top (2nd) floor with a view of the rooftops and terraces nearby. The room was small, but charming, decorated in a charming and unmistakably Venetian style. Everything was clean and the towels were changed daily. The attendants spoke the necessary English and were always pleasant and willing to help. Breakfast - included in the price - was very satisfactory and was served in an intimate dining room just off the reception. I rate this hotel 'excellent' because the only drawbacks were traits common to all of Venice: mosqitoes and small rooms. Considering the price and marvellous location, I don't see how you could do much better than Hotel Pantalon, and I would definitely stay again!", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiblerfaeri", "Title": "\u201cQuiet but central location\u201d", "Author": "Kiblerfaeri", "ReviewID": "UR10169335", "Content": "By far the best aspect of our stay was the hotel's location. Initially it looks like a hole in the wall, but there are tons of nice little restaurants up and down the street. Fantastic pizzeria down the street. The owners speak little to no English, but they managed and serve up fabulous pizza and gelato.Just a 5 minute walk from the San Toma vaporetto stop, it's easy to get to all the main attractions. Front desk personnel went above and beyond with all our questions and concerns. The breakfast was ok, nothing spectacular but decent. The room was small-ish, as was the bathroom. Pretty standard for Italy, but for those with American sensibilities it's a tight squeeze.

Sure it's no 4 or 5 star but it's in a great location. Just off the \"St. Toma\" stop on the vaporetto and a small walk. Great area to just \"get lost\". Night/Weekend Desk lady was AMAZINGLY nice! Breakfast wasn't bad, except the service lady had an attitude. Another fantastic part is a GREAT Pizzeria a couple spaces down with awesome food. We'd nightly get something to eat and head back to the hotel. Only bad things we experienced was the first night the water heater was broken so we had to take a shower with cold water. It was promptly fixed. No Shower curtain so it made a mess, and we had 1 bug visit us... we're still trying to figure out what it was!! Overall i'd definetly stay in the hotel again mostly because of the great location, awesome desk lady and great pizzeria and bakery just down from the hotel!!", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood base for walking central Venice\u201d", "Author": "DrJohn72", "ReviewID": "UR8750579", "Content": "We know Venice well [10th visit] and had no difficulty finding the Pantalon - 13 min on foot from Piazzale Roma, with wheelie luggage-bags. Newcomers should probably take the vaporetto to San Toma - note that the express #82 stops there, as well as the \"stopper\" #1. Room comfortable enough, not small as some have complained; some headroom issues over the bed, as a result of being under the eaves, but a bonus of a view of the top of the Frari tower. Even better view from the roof terrace - key free on request. But it's true there is no shower curtain over the bath - so the floor gets wet no matter what - but that's their problem, it just uses up the towels, which were always changed. And it is a bath, unusual in Venice. Reception staff were consistently excellent. Breakfast basic but OK. Our main problem was a curious one - stale cigarette smell coming in through the aircon, only on the last 2 nights out of 4, so it wasn't the previous occupants. We didn't realise how bad it was until we unpacked at home and everything, clean or not, had to be washed.
