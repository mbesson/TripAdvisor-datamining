We are frequent international travelers and found that while this hotel was very basic, it more than met our needs and was a great deal for the money. We will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Amsterdam, as it gave us a great location in which to be based. We were able to see all the usual attractions, but also got somewhat of a taste of being a local. Hotel Central Park is tucked into a small upscale residential area next to the far end (away from Centraal Station) of the Vondelpark. In late March/early April, we were not able to see the park in all its glory, but bulb flowers were in bloom and trees were beginning to leaf out, and many walkers, runners, and bikers were using the park. During the summer, the hotel's proximity would be an even bigger positive. And don't be misled by the \"residential area\" of the hotel - this means peace and quiet but it is still a two-minute walk from two major streets, neighborhood restaurants, cafes, shops, and a small Albert Heijn supermarket (great if you choose to save some money by buying some of your food at the grocery store.) As we travelled on a transatlantic flight, we arrived in Amsterdam in early morning and got to the hotel around 8 am, very tired, and well before the usual check-in time. Unfortunately they did not have a room for us yet, but we dropped off our luggage and then were finally able to check-in at noon (6 am our time, after no sleep.) This was still before the usual check-in time, and being unable to check-in and having to wander the city like a zombie is pretty much par for the course after an overnight flight, even at some of the largest hotels. We were fortunate to be so close to the park, a good place to relax (as long as there is no rain.) If you are able-bodied and love walking, you can walk to pretty much anywhere in central Amsterdam from this hotel. I recommend walking to the major museums, as they are just a short walk from the other end of Vondelpark. However, if you plan to do a lot of sight-seeing, walking all day every day can take a lot out of you. This hotel is just a few minutes from the stop for Tram 2, which is a very central line, taking you all the way to Centraal Station, as well as other to major spots like Dam Square, Spui, Leidesplein, Koningsplein, and Museumplein. We arrived in Amsterdam at Schiphol Airport, took the very easy train from Schiphol to Centraal Station, and then took Tram 2 to the hotel. No problem, and not confusing. The tram is easy to use and very efficient. With the new OV-chipkaart payment system, it's even easier to use. Just note that Tram 2 from Centraal Station stops on one side of Amstelveenseweg, and the return tram stops on the other side of the intersection, and on the other side of the cross street (meaning, at a diagonal across the busy Amstelveenseweg.) This is no big deal but you can be confused until you figure it out. The room itself was small - if you're used to paying $100 a night and getting a huge American-style hotel room in minor American cities, the size might come as a shock. But, it's pretty much what you get for a similarly-priced room in New York City. The room is not that much bigger than the bed, and the bathroom is small, but it was fine for two people. Just note that the bathroom is REALLY small and in a double room it is pretty much right next to the bed. Every little sound right down to taking toilet paper, or rustling a plastic bag can be heard through the door. The bathroom also has no fan although it does have some sort of ventilation system. This was all no big deal since I was traveling with my husband, but for two people who don't know each other very well, this could be uncomfortable. The room was not equipped with a refrigerator or microwave, but it does come with an electric hotwater kettle and some instant coffee and tea bags. I bought my own box of teabags at Albert Heijn and some breakfast foods and had a great breakfast in-room each morning (convenient and much cheaper than what the hotel was charging.) The window in our room was an old-style floor-to-ceiling set of French doors, and while we did not have a full balcony, the doors were operational and there was about a foot of space where you could stand (and a protective iron gate to keep you from falling out.) This made the room seem larger. We were at the front of the hotel so our view was of the residences across the street, but some of the rooms have a park view. The bed as also incredibly comfortable as other reviewers have noted. One great perk - the hotel now rents bikes! They have a rack right in front of the building. Rates seemed just slightly more than what we would pay elsewhere, but the convenience couldn't be beaten. And, these bikes were much more understated in appearance than is the case with Mac Bikes or Yellow Bikes, or most of the other rental bikes in the city which scream \"tourist.\" The bikes are white and do have a sticker with the hotel name (the new logo as seen on their website) but it is not highly visible. We rented bikes for 48 hours and found it a joy to ride in such a bike-friendly city. We left the hotel by bike and almost immediately entered the Vondelpark, which acts as a major bike thoroughfare, but is also big enough that you can do a lot of recreational biking just in a the park. We rode all over the city and were able to see areas we wouldn't have seen on foot or via tram. We found the Albert Heijn at Museumplein to be more well-stocked than the smaller one near the hotel, so we started shopping there, and we were able to transport our groceries easily on the back rack of the bike. I highly recommend everyone rent a bike. Overall, a great experience. If you are the type of traveller who wants to see the major sites but also wants to get a sense of the city outside of those sites, this hotel is a great place to be based.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA quiet palce to stay in a vibrant city\u201d", "Author": "lumponmyhead", "ReviewID": "UR127901290", "Content": "The hotel is situated a stones throw from the Western end of the Vondelpark.

The bathrooms are more or less an en suite but well styled and clean. I had one of the best nights sleep I've had in a hotel here, the bed comfy and there was no noise either from the other rooms or from the street. The staff are very efficient, you can buy tickets for the museums here and the advice the staff gave us on how to get around the city very useful. Vondelpark is an amazingly peaceful place, if you made a loud noise in this area you'd stick out a mile. I would say this hotel suits couples more than families, although my family were very happy here. Apart from the TV there was nothing here to amuse kids, so if your kids need amusement, you'll be doing it. My kids made their own amusement buy treating the beds as a trampoline and recieved a phone call asking them, very politely, to stop and be a bit quieter.

Check in and out was simple and speedy. We paid the city tax when we checked in (5euros) and were given a gorgeous room with double bed as requested, it was on the 3rd floor and there is a lift for convenience. The room was compact, modern, clean, well kept and the bed was soo comfy and bouncy. The bathroom was lovely as well, compleley tiled floor to ceiling in modern beige with nice fittings and clean with a fab double shower with perfect water pressure. We left a sign on the door to not be disturbed by the maid which we were not but she left fresh linen outside the door for us which was much appreciated.The room was a perfect size for two,we didnt spend much time there but if we had we still would have been happy with the size. There is a flat screen t.v. with a few english channels and also a travel kettle with a few bits and bobs for hot drinks on a tray. When I asked for an extra pillow for my boyfriend it was given to me promptly at reception. When there was a problem with the room card not letting us in, again this was dealt with quickly without fuss. I do not have a single complaint about the service here and appreciated the laid back but efficient style. We did not have the breakfast so cannot comment.

To be fair, if we'd actually asked I'm sure they would've sorted it out, but we were just too tired to make the descent to the ground floor.
