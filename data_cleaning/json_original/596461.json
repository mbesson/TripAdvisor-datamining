{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved it We stayed for a total of 10 days and loved it. But there is a caveat: The hotel dates from the 1980s and is quite faded and the food awful. You will be richly rewarded though by the location and the serenity of the place, and above all, by the friendliness of the staff. With a little tipping and patience, they will go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant as can be. Also if you stay longer, they'll lower the price considerably.", "Date": "Aug 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR765533098", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Texas-Tamu"}, {"Content": "Nice setting While the setting is nice, this place is not appropriate for people with a disability or for small children as there are steps everywhere. The spa and lap pools are a long (150+ steps) down the valley. There is a complimentary afternoon tea with fried bananas served. Staff in the restaurant is friendly and the food is good. In general, the level of English is not great, so there can be misunderstandings when orders are passed. There is a shuttle bus to go to Ubud but one has to book the return or call the hotel otherwise the bus won't be there. People are not necessarily warned and we heard several people had to get a taxi to get back to the hotel as they had waited uselessly for the shuttle at the Ubud Palace. The main problem is that the hotel is right next to a village, separated only by a wall, that hosts thousands of roosters and dogs. Earplugs are a must or you will not sleep at night. Maybe if you are in one of the more expensive villas further down you are away from the noise, but if you stay towards the top, you will get tired. I had a massage (advertised as $ 35) and signed the bill in rupiahs. At check-out, we noticed the spa bill had been typexed and numbers had been changed. When asked about it, the receptionist said they had made a mistake and corrected it. We told her they should have told us about it and we would have signed a new bill but that they should never change the amount on something already signed. She did not seem to think it was a matter of importance. Check your bills.", "Date": "Mar 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR458499841", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "roudoudou"}, {"Content": "Nice resort This resort is actually a fair way out of Ubud in Laplapan, but the regular free shuttle is good.It is a very nice, almost formal resort - a little fancier than we usually stay - and probably a little less friendly. Staff keep to themselves and don't talk much.It seemed almost empty when we were there - had a free evening meal and were the only ones in the restaurant. Had breakfast on our own also - and had the pool to ourselves.The setting is lovely, the villas very nice - as were the outdoor shower and bath for 2 (which takes forever to fill).", "Date": "Feb 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR600338101", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Placebo"}, {"Content": "Natura(l) gem Natura wasn't even on our shortlist. But our local agent recommended it highly, so we decided to give it a try. And she was right! We're almost too reluctant to share the secret.The resort hugs a steep and lush valley, overlooking the Petanu River. One can see that the resort has been built to blend into the environment, not impose on it. The villas are well spread out, offering utmost privacy to guests. We stayed in a one-bedroom villa with a plunge pool filled by spring water. A true treat after a sticky day out! Another gem is the outdoor shower. There is a bathtub big enough for two, and a shower head for a quick rinse. We also loved the day bed which overlooks the river valley. At night, the silence is broken only by the gushing sounds of the river below and the romancing cicadas. Breakfast was amazingly good, especially the fresh breads and Balinese coffee! It is served at the restaurant perched high on the valleyside overlooking the tree tops. Service is efficient and friendly without being intrusive. While the resort offers hourly shuttle to town, it is still a good 10-minutes ride over hilly terrain. There is no way one could walk or cycle to town without turning it into a major workout. So if you want easy access on foot, this would not be suitable. However, as a tranquil place to chill out, Natura would be perfect. We'll be back, naturally!", "Date": "Jul 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR339372668", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jung11"}, {"Content": "The resort was great..
