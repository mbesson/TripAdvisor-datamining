We also did Vatican City which was nice and St. Peter's...be aware that on Wednesday's the Pope makes a speech so you cant get into the basilica until late afternoon so we went back the following day and that was worth it. We also climbed the duomo and be aware that it really is hard and narrow but worth it for the view of Rome. The Pantheon was great and a quick 20 min tour.

Watery coffee, Tang-like juice, a croissant wrapped in plastic like they were purchased in bulk for the week, a hot dog bun roll....cereal, yogurt (in a rotating, slushee type cylinder), two pitchers of milk for the cereal (one warm and one warmer), some packaged biscuits, along with a biscuit with yogurt inside.

The best thing about the hotel is the location, I came in on the train from Florence and left on the Leonardo Express train (11 Euros) for the airport (FCO) and was able to simply walk from the Romi Termini station with my luggage with no problems. The hotel is also near a Metro (subway) stop that will get you to the Vatican for only 1 Euro. The hotel itself is small, only 27 rooms on 3 floors (the top 2 floors are regular apartments) and is very safe and secure in that the front desk must buzz you in whenever you return. I found the front desk people to be very helpful with whatever tourist-related questions I had. The room itself, in my American opinion, was small but neat and clean, it had a safe in the closet and a stand-alone air conditioner. I thought the price I paid (110 Euros for a single) was a little high but I've never been to Rome before and all rooms might be expensive. The only negative was the breakfast, it was lacking quality and selection but was included in the price so fill up and save some money where you can. I also felt the street noise and church bells were annoying so if you are a light sleeper ask for a room facing the interior courtyard which, by the way, was a welcome retreat after walking around Rome all day. The hotel did have an Internet PC for 5 Euros/hour but there are many Internet Cafes that only charge 1.50 to 2 Euros per hour in the same neighborhood. There is also a good self-service laundromat 1 street over if you're like me and need to do laundry while on vacation The good parts were by far the location, air conditioning, front desk personnel and security. The bad, smaller room, some street noise and a sub-par breakfast. If you can get a good Internet deal this is an acceptable hotel.

We even walked 50 min up to Vatican City because the map was that easy to follow! Or, conversely you can take a hop-on, hop-off bus (number 110) and see all the sites.

It was a typical, small European hotel, but the owners and workers were so helpful. Our train arrived late in the evening and the owner had stayed late anticipating our arrival. The rooms were nice with air conditioning and very nice furnishings. It was located very close to the train station (just a few blocks away) and near Metro stations, too. The staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions, directions to nearby attractions, and anything else we asked of them. Definitely a place to stay when you're in Roma!", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, USA", "Title": "\u201cGood and recommendable\u201d", "Author": "GradguyAtlanta", "ReviewID": "UR3416579", "Content": "I just got back from Italy and since I got such great help from this site I decided to write my reviews. I stayed at the Montreal 3 nights. In general I would say it was a good place to stay. However, I think that for the money I pay (95 euros a night) I could have gotten a nice place somewhere else. However, I also have to say I was in Rome in the middle of the Pope election and it might have been hard to find a single room. I had booked this a couple months ahead so I decided just to stay there. No matter how you book it, the pictures are a bit enhanced. The rooms are spacious and clean, the staff was friendly. The breakfast is adequate. The location is great, only a 5 10 minute walk from the train station. There is a grocery store almost around the corner, and plenty of places to eat. I walk from it to the Coliseum and all the attractions, however it was a long walk, but I like that. If I have a choice, for the same money I would try another hotel, just to try. However, I can stay there again especially if I get a better rate. I do recommend the hotel; I just say do your research before booking.", "Date": "April 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cRate Switching\u201d", "Author": "West-Coast-Travelers", "ReviewID": "UR3102484", "Content": "Used the hotel's email address to get a rate quote which was 115 Euro/night.

Hotel had clearly taken extra steps to make security a priority, which was a nice touch. Room was well-sized and quiet, overlooking the small courtyard where we enjoyed a take-home pizza one night. Breakfast in the cramped eating area was below average for Italy, with few fresh items and micro-sized cups of poor orange juice that were dispensed slowly by the staff, as if from a Pez dispenser. Easy walk to Termini and the Metro. Generally felt like a safe location, but at night we did see a few homeless on the hotel street's sidewalks, and the dimly lit walk from the Metro would have seemed more uncomfortable later in the night when the tourist crowds thinned out. Coloseum/Forum was easily walkable from hotel, and those in decent shape could continue walking on to Trevi, Pantheon and others from there in a single day - but might take Metro or taxi back to Montreal. Vatican is an easy but very crowded Metro ride, and even then requires some walking. The supermarket on a corner near the church (the only one we'd stumbled upon in Italy!) was a nice find for inexpensive water, wine and other essentials.", "Date": "October 24, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Montreal Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d228921-Reviews-Montreal_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$86 - $166*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4 Via Carlo Alberto</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "228921", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8b/4c/8b4c2b0085bbd3e7257af8598d9e271c1large.jpg"}}
