This saved us lots of headaches and money as we parked for free and used the subway to get around.

I was there with my 2 teenagers (12 and 14 years old) and my wife. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my first visit at this hotel; I have been there few years ago, when Montreal had a pro baseball team (\u00c2\u00b1 4 years ago), the Expos; it is located at 5 minutes walk to the Olympic stadium. The hotel rooms are as I remember; nice, large, clean and bright. As all the rooms are located in the back of the hotel; no street noise. The lobby is large, but a little bit boring. The room I got had a mini-fridge, microwave, free wireless internet (average hotels speed) and 2 double beds really comfortable. I would have appreciated two queens but it was OK! This hotel is not downtown as mentioned by Expedia (I knew it before!) but it is a really nice location for a family with at walking distance: Olympic installations, Biodome (nature museum), Botanical garden, Saputo stadium (pro soccer), movies theatre and many restaurants. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also at less than 10 minutes walk to a subway station: in 8 to 10 minutes you will be downtown Montreal thru the subway. But as the parking is free at the hotel, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay the expensive downtown parking price! The hotel have also a large indoor pool with a sauna (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it this time), a restaurant and a bar.

The operation hours of the restaurant are variable; when I was there it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open at night and for lunch. But you can go at the restaurants located near the hotel (2 minutes by foot) like Score (family style with an impressive salad bar) or Madison steakhouse.

I was staying for 3 nights on business and I tagged on 2 extra nights for leisure at the end. I wanted to have the charges go to my business credit card for the first three nights and to pay separately for the second two. I told this to them when I called to extend my stay from 3 nights to 5. Then I told them this when I checked in. Then I told them again when I asked for a room upgrade after the first night (I'll get to the reason for this in a second). After all this, I ended up with 4 nights on my corporate card and 1 night on my personal card. Was this really so complicated? More significant was how uncomfortable the beds were. I originally booked a standard room. I don't need to have anything fancy, just a comfortable place to sleep. The mattress might as well have been made of rock. I had a lot of trouble sleeping and my lower back was really sore the next morning (which made my first day of work a lot harder than it had to be). The next day I had to ask if they had anything more comfortable. I know it wasn't just me being picky since I had a friend along with me for the trip and she was just as uncomfortable as I was. We got upgraded to a deluxe room at no extra cost, but they had already booked all the deluxe rooms for the last day of our stay so we had to go back to a standard room. The deluxe room was really pretty basic. I think the beds in those rooms should be the \"standard\" ones. The standard room we got for our last night was pretty atrocious. In addition to the super uncomfortable beds, the toilet was running (though it was pretty quite), turning the air-conditioning down seemed to turn the heat on, and the sound on the tv was really fuzzy no matter what the volume was set to. On top of all that there was a constant swishing sound like we were beside their washing machines or something. The location was good for my work, but I should have moved to a hotel downtown for the rest of my stay as it wasn't terribly convenient for the leisure side of my trip. It was walking distance to a metro station, but it was a good 10 minute walk. They had a shuttle bus that would take us to the metro for free, but that doesn't help for the trip back to the hotel after a long day of sight-seeing or a night out. The metro ride itself was a good 25 minutes to get downtown, of course depending on where you're going downtown. The outdoor pool was nice. The first full day we were there the hot tub was out of service, but it was back up and running for the rest of our stay. It was good and hot. The indoor pool didn't really look very nice but I didn't personally use it so I can't say how good it is.

Strange, suspicious looking characters walking the halls looking like they are robbing rooms too. Did not feel safe and slept with a chair holding the door handle. Horrible experience...never again. Not even if it was for free. Restaurant food gross and expensive. If there was one positive thing, I'd have to say the free parking.

And that's the only really positive thing I have to say: it was close to my meeting. The building exterior is a 70's-soviet-block-style concrete bunker. Once you're inside the lobby area is relatively nice. The hallways are drab with low ceilings and institutional feel, as are rooms. All the basic amenities were there (TV, minifridge, etc.), but the decor and ambience were depressing, the bathroom and vanity area was very small, the ironing board was the flimsiest thing I have seen in the hundreds of hotel stays I've had in the last decade and so forth. Service was OK, but indifferent. No 'automatic' checkout that business travelers expect, had to stop at front desk to check out. I did not eat here so can't comment on the restaurant. Everything in the room was basically clean and serviceable, but I feel the 4-star / AAA 3-diamond rating is off by at least one point. The other other hotels I've stayed in Montreal have been fantastic in comparision (Le Saint Sulpice, Auberge Bonaparte).", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Douglas, MA.", "Title": "\u201cThe lobby is nice, that's the only part\u201d", "Author": "dbfluke", "ReviewID": "UR5447962", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights. It was a softball tournament. The lobby looks nice for the money spent, still a little expensive for what they have. The rooms are small & need to be updated years ago. The beds are uncomfortable (hard as the floor ) The a/c didn't work well either. In the morning everything had a wet feel to it, which when we left the hotel your clothes would have a odor to them. Our bathroom sinks water did not turn off completely, so you had to be careful using the blow dryer, the outlet was right next to the sink. We had a few issues with our room, the fridge & tv didn't work. we notified the front desk 3 times over a 5 hr span, nobody came to fix them. So they just switched our room. The indoor pool is small compared to the pictures they have advertised. The so called hot tub is not that hot, only reached about 90 degrees one time durring our stay. Another inconvience is that they only have 1 main elevator for the 7 floors. So you always had to wait for the elevator. The hotel gift shop will convert money for you but I suggest that you go down the street to the bank. The gift shop would give you 1.05 can for 1.00 us the front desk would give you 1.08 can for 1.00 us . On the way home @ the border they will change 1.10 can for 1.00 us . be careful check the exhange rate.

Yet, it does not have security cameras in the parking lot or any secutiry guards. Our Chevy truck was parked directly in front of the hotel next to large dark color windows where the bar is located.

The token is then used to open the gate to leave. We noticed plenty of tokens are sitting in a bowl on the desk. We went to a police station to file a report with a family from Michigan who had there plates stolen. A few months back Montreal police were assigned to watch the lot until the lefts trinkled done to a few now-and-then!

While the executive suite seemed nice and luxurious, many things are broken and the stained-glass doors barely open. The bathtub no longer had many of the installed features but at least the suite wasn't as dark as regular rooms.

Everything was in good working order and my room had a fine view of the Olympic Tower (also the Pom Bakery next door...) The hotel bills itself as being across the street from Olympic Stadium, which technically is true; it is across the street from Parc Olympique, and one only needs to cross the street once to get there. However, the stadium is a ways south in this large park from the hotel, and if you're seeing the Expos, and need to go in the one place where tickets are sold, it's really the equivalent of at least a five-block walk. Still, the location is very useful; this probably is the closest place you can stay to the stadium, and likewise it is very handy to all the attractions in that area, like Biodome, the botanical gardens and insectarium. (It's also across the street from the large Olympic Village apartments). It's not terribly far from the metro either if you want to go downtown. Free parking (they give you a ticket to come and go at the front desk) and a reasonable rate give it a leg up on the pricier downtown hotels where parking can be very costly. There are several large restaurants within a few blocks going up Sherbrooke away from the park. Externally, it's grey, cementy looking construction--which fits in kind of well with the Olympic era things built a decade or so before the hotel. Not a beautiful hotel from the outside by any means, but the area is clean and safe.
