I was in a standard room and thought about upgrading but honestly it is really enormous for one person so didn't bother. Peeked into a one bedroom as it was being cleaned, absolutely ENORMOUS and spotless. If you are here as a couple or family hard to beat it. Poolside breakfast is really nice. I found the distance to town a plus quite frankly. Playa del Carmen is so boisterous at night, and it goes ALL night, so this is such a welcome respite. Who wants to listen to all that while trying to sleep? this is perfect, 15 minute walk or $5 cab ride. They booked all my daytime excursions and the frontdesk is very attentive. They called each evening to ask if everything was alright in my room. The one thing I did tell them, that the showerhead was only facing down and I'm tall, was fixed immediately- actually replaced. If you are looking to be in the center of it all and don't mind the noise then you may not like this, but if you want to have a buffer zone between you and all the mayhem this is perfect.

As we would be leaving after a month in Mexico the next day I thought it would be nice to stay at a hotel with some nicer amenities and pay abit more than normal so we could enjoy a relaxed morning in a pleasant local prior to a long afternoon and evening of traveling. We arrived early afternoon, taking a $7 taxi from the ferry terminal to the hotel located in the playacar complex just south ( a pleasant 15 minute walk) from Playa's busy 5th avenue. The management at the desk located our reservation and as we were early understandably asked us to wait 20 minutes for our room which we did in their pleasant lobby overlooking the pool and a view of the adjacent golf course. We were given water and were surprised to find our &70 dollar standard room had been upgraded to a luxurious deluxe suite- what a treat. Marble floors, a gorgeous balcony with view of the beautiful grounds, full kitchen, modern, bathroom and bed room. The staff as we have found throughout Mexico was professional, polite and dedicated, their pride in their work and their obvious contentment in their jobs creates an atmosphere that makes your stay all the more enjoyable. On top of everything described included was a wonderful buffet breakfast by the pool with multiple choices native and european choices from papaya and motelenos to hot cakes and coffee cake.

I know the work involved in providing an excellent customer experience. This establishment does it in spades. My suite was larger than most apartments I've lived in. Full Living room, Dining room, Kitchen (I like to cook, and could have used more cooking equipment, and there was no coffee maker, but most people don't cook on vacation, so I get it). Huge bedroom with a fantastic bed. I slept better than I ever have on a vacation. A nice bathroom with seperate shower and jacuzzi tub, 4, yes, 4 balconies on the 1st floor, and an enormous wrap around balcony on the rooftop, with a private hot tub, which, fortunately, was not heated at the time, and I used as a plunge pool. A hot tub seems out of place anyway, considering the temperature in Playa. 85 degrees every day. The suite has beautiful vaulted brick ceilings throughout. A very nice touch. And the view of Cozumel from the roof deck was a nice surprise. The staff was very courteous, and in spite of a booking snafu, handled things efficiently, and professionally. I was upgraded to the large suite, which is only slightly more expensive to begin with.. and even at twice the price, the upgrade is well worth it. Honestly, spoil yourself a little. Breakfast was delicious, plentiful and varied each day. So nice to start the day by the lake on the golf course. It really set the tone each morning. The grounds are well kept, and the neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and very, very safe. The downsides (which really had little impact on me) that everyone talks about are as follows: 1) It is difficult to find the place the first time, and for me, the second time. Once you get your bearings, all is good. I would suggest printing a Google Earth shot of the neighborhood before you leave for your trip. it will help. 2) It is a 20 minute walk to the commercial district and the beach. I liked the walk, and even lost 5 lbs on the trip, so I'm all for it, but I can see where people could get tired of it. I rented a car, and suggest you do, as well. Free parking on site. After spending 10 nights, I was so sad to leave. I walked into town (Playa Del Carmen) daily, and saw some beautiful hotels and complexes, but the noise, and crowds, for me, were a huge turn off.

A car is helpful and here are DIRECTIONS!\u201d", "Author": "ArtTeacherAmy", "ReviewID": "UR125397233", "Content": "We just got back from a week in Playa Del Carmen and stayed 6 nights at the Hacienda Vista Real. We LOVED the hotel. It is SO quiet, I always slept well. Buffet breakfast was great, different everyday, eggs, potatoes, juice, toast, fruit, a mexican dish, coffee, tea. And eating by the pool and lake every morning in the warm sun was lovely. The beds were comfortable, rooms were big with high ceilings, granite tile bathroom, cavernous shower. I thought the staff was great, always friendly and ready to help. They give you fresh beach towels everyday and FREE water bottles. I suggest for $20 more a night upgrading to the larger suites, which we took a look at. We stayed in 2020 which had 2 double beds and a balcony overlooking the gardens (not a suite, just a room). The suites are HUGE; living room, dining room, full kitchen and bedroom. I would get one of these if we went back with our daughter. The place had a few families, but not a lot of kids running around. Mostly couples. Nice pool area too. Downsides: if you do not have a car ( I really suggest it! We saved a ton of money not buying tours of the ruins and the car was only $10 a day!) you will have to take taxis ($4-5) into town which is a 5 minute drive to 10th AVE which has all the shops and restaurants and nightclubs. You could walk into town, 20 mins. We walked 15 minutes to the beach one day, but I would not want to do that everyday. With a car you can drive to the different beaches, we had a great day snorkeling at Akumal ($12pp for mask and life jacket from Akumal Dive shop. $2 to park in lot across from it.) Other downside is finding this hotel! We got in at 11pm and drove around 30 minutes to find it! HERE ARE THE DIRECTIONS! TAKE the highway, 307 from Cancun airport south about 40 minutes to Playa Del Carmen that part is easy. Then as you come near the end of town, you can tell you are going to start heading into nowhere again, big sign for TULUM, you want to take a Retourno and head back NORTH on 307 STAY in the right 2 lanes. Then look for the HUGE PlayaCar sign in stone. You want to turn into the second one. (If you miss it take the road on the right by Holiday Inn.) The streets are not marked. Come past the security gate, and look for the hotel signs in the middle of the road. First right is for Vista Real and Pakal. Pass the OXXO, and look for the BIG PAKAL golf sign, it is BEHIND PAKAL. Of course we did not have a clue where this place was so we drove all over Playacar. OK, go through security gates of Pakal, and now head to the left as you drive down. Go all the way down and the hotel is at the end ( no sign! They need to put up a big sign!) Free parking in the lot. If you miss the Playacar entrance, take the street by Holiday Inn which goes all the way down, and then turn right into the Playacar development, and then another right by the traffic circle. Take that up.) We had a great time, we saw a lot with the car: Tulum, Coba ruins, Akumal beach, and snorkeling in a cenote and ziplining at AtkunChen. We went to the beachclub at PLaya Mamitas ( $40 pesos for a lounge with umbrella) but got there too late for one. And we drove into town everynight for dinner on 10th AVe. FOUND PARKING ON 20th AVE between 6th and 8thNorte everynight! We had great food on the Ave. Liked most restaurants we ate in. Lots of fun shops. Great place to visit. I heard Playa Del Carmen is better than Cancun. And one night we went out for a drink, stopped in Mandala ( says $12 cover but they let us in at 11.30pm free) and we went to the club across the street on the beach.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTwo star...at best\u201d", "Author": "Davidsf2012", "ReviewID": "UR125160551", "Content": "We arrived late at night to fun a largely abandoned hotel at the end of a dead end street.

Playa del Carmen seemed to be a good central location but we didn\u2019t want stay downtown or at a big, noisy resort. The Vista Real really fit the bill. The hotel sits on a large pond in the center of a golf course. After going through 2 security gates in the quiet golf resort community of Playacar, we felt extremely safe indeed! As you can see by some of the photos, the hotel oozes Olde World Mexican charm. We\u2019re suckers for places with character and Vista has it in spades! There\u2019s local flavor and detail around every corner. We chose the ambassador suite because of the full kitchen and the balcony views. It was a wonderful room and almost too much space for just two people. The kitchen could have been cleaner and wasn't exactly fully stocked but we enjoyed making our own fresh guacamole and preparing our lunches for the days\u2019 outings. Per Mexican standards, the beds were very firm. We just borrowed the mattress from the sleeper couch in the living room and had great sleep. The hotel atmosphere was very calm and quiet. However, like many of the hotels and haciendas in Mexico, everything is made of colorful tile, stone, plaster and concrete that makes things \u201cecho-y\u201d. That\u2019s part of the experience. The bathroom was quite small compared to the size of the suite, but the shower was huge and hot water was plentiful. Although some reviews complained of bugs, we did not have any problem. Perhaps having a garden-level room might add to the likelihood? And hey, this is the tropics! The in-room safe was easy to use and we left our passports and most of our cash there every day without worry. The breakfast buffet included in the price was better than I had hoped - lots of variety and freshly made right there in the outdoor kitchen by the pool. It definitely catered to more of the Latin/European tastes and there was plenty to choose from. We really looked forward to the quiet mornings eating outside and watching the ducks, coots, herons, and egrets around the pond. The grounds of the Vista are lovely and well-maintained. There is a Mayan-themed building attached to the hotel that used to be a spa back when the Vista was a time-share. (The main photo on this sight shows the old entrance with the large pool in front - it's now a garden area). The spa building is no longer in use, but it\u2019s fun to look at! The staff were exceptional. We initially got a room on the ground floor, but asked to move to an upper room for better views and more privacy. No problem. The pool was cool, clean, and lovely. There is free internet for use in the soaring, palapa-roofed lobby. We never once saw a time-share shark. By car or taxi, downtown Playa del Carmen is just minutes away. A stroll will take you 25-30 minutes but it is very safe and quiet. We tried to drive once. If you\u2019ve ever tried to drive in a Mexican city, (especially at night on the weekends) you\u2019ll understand why we chose to walk instead! There is a restaurant in the hotel, but we never tried it. Right outside the first security gate there is a little mall with a convenience store (with an ATM) and several restaurants. On a couple of rainy nights, we drove there and had both excellent empanadas and thin-crust pizza. Once you figure it out, getting on to the main coastal highway 307 is very quick and easy. Driving south to Akumal or north to Puerto Morelos took only around 20 minutes. The Vista is not a 5-star, luxury hotel. It is a nod to the romantic elegance of a time gone by and the new owners seem to be trying to return it to its former glory. It would not be the ideal place for families with young children, party-ers, or beach bums. For our needs and travel style it worked very well. It was a lovely place to start and end our days. We also got a very good deal online that gave us all that quiet charm for the same price as a budget box hotel in the States! If we had to pay typical Mexican resort rates, I'd have found more to complain about.

I already knew we would have a rent car, and the photos online showed a lovely hotel. This is by far the best deal in Playa del Carmen. I knew its location inside Playa Car and studied the google map so I was able to drive right to the front entrance of the hotel with no problems. The staff is very personable and caring. The room was just lovely. 2 queen size beds overlooking the pool. A/C was great. If you are an independent type of traveller, like to have a rent car, go out for lunch and dinner and eat breakfast at your hotel, this will be a great home base to discover Playa del Carmen. The hotel is like a hacienda. Just big enough to have lovely grounds, pool and entrance, yet small enough to feel like you are at someones personal hacienda. We enjoyed the buffet each morning served around the pool area, and explored all day to return to the pool to refresh ourselves before going out again. The hotel sits inside a 2nd gaurded gate entrance inside Playa Car. We felt very safe, enough to stroll in the evenings way after dark. The corner stores provide several types of quick foods, a convienence store, laundry, and hair salon. We used all the stores while at the hotel. Easy in and out. The grounds of the hotel are amazing, photos do not do it justice. It is true some of the \"normal\" hotel things are lacking, however, we did not miss any of it. For example, no bar. We are not drinkers so it did not matter to us. The restaurant closes at 3 each day, not a problem for us, we left early and ate out each day. The staff makes up for anything you might think you need by just asking. A point that someone might find useful is that parking is very close to the lobby, and easy to get to your room and pool without walking forever. The rooms are designed so that you can have a 3 bedroom villa with a full service kitchen in your room. The rooms have separate entrances, and a large family gathering would be ideal here. We stayed 11 nights, and I wish I could have stayed forever.

There were some strange issues on the hotel grounds which I will mention, but this place was so beautiful and peaceful that I came home missing it. The staff is very nice and friendly. The strange issues would be the hot tub--- they have a huge hot tub that is filled with water but no jets running and when we asked they said it didn't work. When I asked about the gym, she said it was over in the spa area (which is closed down) and she also said there was no air conditioning at the gym. We walked over to see it and found it upstairs...it was so hot we would have passed out from the heat within minutes so we kept exploring the Spa area. On the rooftop we found a beautiful pool (clean and full of water) not being used by anyone (weird). The breakfast buffet wasn't the best food ever but it's free and that was a nice surprise to us ~ they had a lot of food to choose from for a free buffet. It seemed odd that the bar was only open til 3pm but you learn to survive :) ~ buy a six pack and keep it in your room fridge! The air conditioning was okay but could have been a little cooler. The pool is perfect and very relaxing ~ since there are not hundreds of people staying here, you will have the pool to yourself a lot of the time. I took hundreds of photos of the place. I was grateful that they allow you to print your plane tickets before you leave...it's just nicer than the huge resorts for many reasons like that. All of the workers were friendly. There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby area. We found that in the heat, it was much better to get a cab than walk. We took a cab at least once a day.....it's a quick trip and well worth it.---Just a little inconvenient at times.

Those who envisioned it as a luxury resort on a golf course and a spa, obviously have not reached that goal. However, I have not seen the entire place, every room, so my impression may be biased. My room (Imperial 302-1) was a Super Value at Orbitz. Booked for just $72 it was worth at least a couple hundreds dollars if it was at a hotel at a good location. Large room with marble flooring, heavy wooden doors, dome ceiling made of bricks, good linens, and other luxury attributes were a nice surprise. Complementary breakfast could compete with what you may expect at a luxury hotel. But here come some but(s). As some people have mentioned, the place feels empty. There were guests checking in, but there was no activity for them besides the computer with Internet in the lobby that would keep them around after breakfast. Located at the end of a gated residential area, it has no entertainment near by, so you either walk about 15-20 min to Playa del Carmen or ride a taxi for about $5 to get there. The building next to the hotel, the spa, is not functioning for the primary purpose. Some areas in the hotel show a sign of neglect, but they are a bit off sight. So, if you like to get better room for less, like to play golf and have access to the course nearby, do not mind getting out for dinner and seeing some neglectaway from the main path, you should like it. I met someone who has rented a scooter so he and his wife could ride to the beach so that he would not have to carry his kite surfing equipment. He liked the deal as staying on the beach would be too costly. We stayed one night because we arrived one day early due to a coming winter storm at where we live and needed a place to stay.

As an independent backpacker on this trip, I cannot state how bad the location is if you don't have a car. I took a bus from Tulum and they dropped me off at Playacar. With backpack on my back I approached security and they had me walk literally two hours in the wrong direction. I then had to get a taxi to go in the other direction. To walk into Playa del Carmen proper it will take you about 30-40 minutes and I walk at a fast clip even with a major backpack on. This started my experience off on a very poor note. The hotel is actually located at the end of a residential area thus I was passing kids playing outside and neighbors socializing. This is not what I wanted from my stay in Playa del Carmen. The hotel was extremely isolated from anything else thus I had to take taxis back and forth into town at 10us per trip. Upon checking in the guy tried giving me the room behind the front desk. The room had no windows and smelled of mildew like you would not believe. I refused to stay in the room and almost left without even asking for a refund. When I asked for a different room he said they were filled but that was that a blatant lie as I was on the internet that afternoon and saw they had plenty of rooms. In the end, there may have only been a few people staying at the place while I was there. There were only a couple of cars in the overnight parking which I assumed were the employees cars. The breakfast buffet was great as long as you didn't order eggs from the 'chef'. He mixed up my order two mornings in a row and on the third morning I decided I would just go with the buffet eggs instead of fresh ones. The staff stood around talking and were basically not doing anything with people sitting with empty dishes in front of them or tables with empty dishes where people had left. The breakfast buffet staff were the epitome of what one does not want in a restaurant or in the service industry. The man that checked me in at the front desk who lied to me about them being filled was actually quite accommodating as I was in a very foul mood after having walked so much and finding the hotel was so far in the middle of nowhere. The wifi did not work in the rooms thus one has to go into the lobby. Even the lobby for 2 of the 3 days didn't have it thus you have to use their old desktop. A very nice property but without people around it was somewhat haunting. The rooms were decorated in a style I would associated with the a 1950's Las Vegas hotel. Very cheap furniture/furnishings/television. The bathroom was large and very well appointed. I got the room for 60US per night which i think is worth it only if you have a room with a patio, if you are looking for peace and solitude, you have your own car to get into town, and you are sharing it with someone.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful and quaint\u201d", "Author": "Michiepoo", "ReviewID": "UR83474726", "Content": "My parents as well as my sis, her hubby and me and my hubby.... all loved this place.

THIS location, however, is different. First, the initial room we were given had one window that let in NO light. Literally, with the lights off in the middle of the day it is BLACK. After discussing my concern with the front desk (and having them tell me there is nothing they can do for me today unless we want to pay extra for a suite upgrade- unapologetic staff was the norm here), we stayed there for the first night (of 4). We went to sleep at around 10 or 11 and were woken up at midnight when our neighbors returned for the night. I would have been annoyed at them had they been screaming or doing something terribly disruptive. Sadly, they were just talking in their room and due to the terrible (lack of) sound insulation it sounded like they were sitting on my bed talking to me. I could have easily taken part in their conversation without moving. SO- the next day we got moved to the one studio room with a sliding door (that did not lock properly!!! but we picked our battles). Yes, the lighting was better but you give up the spa tub in this room. That night, all of a sudden it smelled like someone was smoking in our room. It turned out that was due to the 2inch gap around the door between our room and the adjoining room. When we asked to be put in any room where there was no adjoining room no matter what the price (this was after two terrible nights sleep due to neighbor noise) they told us that ALL rooms have adjoining rooms. I suppose if you are traveling with friends this is not a terrible problem BUT for us, it was a deal breaker. If you are a light sleeper at all, BRING EAR PLUGS. Really!!! On the positive (not that this mattered as the BONES of the place ruined our stay), the breakfast was nice and the walk that people complained about is really not that bad. The weather is generally great and its an easy walk 15-20 minutes max to the start of downtown.

This means that it is always gloomy in your room and have to turn the lights on during daylight. Second, the paint was coming out of our bathroom ceiling, leaving white chips on the floor. While we were showering, the damp made it worse and we would have paint fall on our heads. The worst part was when we enterred the room, there was an awful smell... like ultra humid and stinky. The manager recognized this smell was not normal, but she just said that it was due to the fact that so little air comes in the room, as their ventilation system does not work properly in that room. We told them they should change our room, but she said they were booked (then why the heck are they selling this room?). But she said she would do something about it. She called a house keeper, told us to wait in the lobby. We came back 20 minutes later, the house keeper had spilled all over the floor and in the bathroom this artificial cinammon oil meant to camouflage the smell - but she had put so much the whole place was even worse and it was hard to breathe because of the chemicals! So then we had to bring in extra fans to fan the place for 2 hours - and try to get this awful cinammon smell out. We finally managed to get the smell out and go to bed. The next day they put us in another room that was ok (no smell) - but the windows were still tiny.

When checking in, the hotel had messed up all the rooms. After an hour of figuring everything out we were taken to our rooms. One room was a 2 bedroom suite that was very spacious and somewhat nice until we went into the back bedrooms that smelt so terribly of mildew it was hard to imagine sleeping there. After getting over the smell we realized that the windows are directly off the lobby so you can hear the staff and all the people milling through the lobby every 15 min. it sounded like some drunk teenager just walked into your room. After checking in we went down to the pool cafe and and had some drinks and appetizers. The drinks were weak.... so weak we had to order extra shots on the side and add them ourselves. When the food arrived (Nachos, tacos, ceviche, guacomole) it was tasteless and terrible. The ceviche was made of frozen fish and smelt terrible we could not eat it. After the drinks and appetizers we headed up to Jazmin the fine dining restaurant. We were very excited to eat hear as the other revues raved about the food. Entering a very beautifully designed restaurant I was excited until the food came. We could not imagine the food being any worse then the pool cafe, we were wrong! I ordered seared yellowtail which later led to food poisening that evening. All 8 of us could not finish our food or take more then one bite. After a uncomfortable night sleep in rock hard beds we were ready to soak up the sun and swim in the caribbean ocean. The hotel said they have a beach club a short shuttle ride away that offered towels, lounge, chairs a restaurant and a bar with service. When we inquired about the beach club they told us the shuttle only runs twice a day and that there is no beach club or food but they would provided us with drinks and a lunch box. Before heading to the beach the front desk informed us that there is no lunch boxes but they will provide us with drinks. We headed out on what was suppost to be a 15 min shuttle ride that ended up to be 45 min. long trip almost to Tulum. The beach was stunning but with no food and only two 2 liter bottles of coke and some cups provided it was unbelievable and really ruined the beach day. A long story short the service the location and the food were terrible. I have never ever stayed at a place this terrible and it was so bad it almost ruined our trip.

Let us start by saying we tend to be more independent travellers, and this was thef irst time we actually did an entire week's worth of an all-inclusive type of vacation, so we obviously have no standard to compare to. However, we have visited other AI resorts on day trips, ( Palace, Iberostar, RUI,Sandals, etc) We had orginally booked our 1 BR timeshare at the Mayan Palace, ( (which was not AI) just outside of Playa Del Carmen, but were overwhelmed with the size and how busy the resort was , compared to how much smaller, quieter and peaceful it had been 5 years ago when we had last been there. We had booked the promo \" timeshare\" tour of HVR at the airport on our way in, and got a sunset cruise for 2 with lobster dinners for $64.00 US, which was a good deal . We had some problems getting there, as we were actually hijacked and taken to another similar named resort first... but we insisted on going to what we had booked and they eventually put us in a cab which brought us there. By then it was 11 AM and we were obviously late for our 9 AM breakfast meeting. The people at the resort who run the sales promotions were appalled at what had happened to us and refunded all the money we had paid, while still giving us the sunset cruise and dinner for free. Bonus! this gave us an excellent first impression of customer service, although it was probably just good business.- I think they were happy that we still showed up. Needless to say, we had breakfast, toured the resort, and found it to be the perfect kind of small, intimate resort that we prefer. And that is the key to this place- it IS small, and you have to be able to amuse yourself, or you will definately not find it to your liking. Bring a book, your walkman, and if need be your computer and own DVD's to amuse yourself as there is nothing offered at the resort. There are no pool activities, no shows, no entertainment of any sort- for that you would have to either go in to Playa or Cancun itself. The service is laid back and very Mexican- nothing happens in a hurry, so if you are an \"A\" type it might not be to your liking unless you are trying to slow down the pace for a week. Everything was clean, and we thought it was well maintained overall.. We thought the room was nice, although a bit small ( we had a studio, and our window did open to the outside, although we did meet other poeople with inside rooms who did feel it was 'dungeonlike' ), but since they allowed us to move from the MP we felt that we should not be overly cirtical as they basically offered us what they had available. We did have to purchase the AI plan, and felt that it was worth the money. However, I do agree with other traveller's comments that bit more variety in menus would have been appreciated. We found the overall quality of the food to be very good - they claimed it was gourmet, but for that distinction they have to work a bit harder( food & beverages/alchohol selection at RUI Palace RV and resorts of that qaulity still better by far, but then you also pay more, there ).The staff were always ready to try to honour any special request ( one morning we asked them to cook up some quaker oats we had brought with us, which they did). Unlike some other travellers here , we found the personnel to be very friendly and helpful. I found it interesting that someone said they paid $ 10 for the van to take them to the beach club-we missed the shuttle as I was late coming back from a spa appointment, and I had to pay $ 25 US to get them to drive me one way ( my husband decided to stay by the pool up at the spa that day). Be warned that the shuttle only runs at specific times... both there and back. The beach is beautiful, but with the exception of about 2 small places everything else has been destroyed by recent hurricanes and not rebuilt, so there is really nothing to do there except swim & tan. There is small eating area, and I had no problem as they had my favorite lunch item of shrimp , so I have no complaints. My only reservation was the washrooms, which were out of commission- and had to be ' pail flushed'- they definately need to be attended to! Beware there are no change rooms on site that we could find. My husband really enjoyed the salt water jacuussi pool and the pool upstairs by the dining room , although they could use more shade up there as it is sweltering during the day. I preferred the beach, although it was nice to come back and warm up in the salt water pool & heated chairs. after the beach which was cooler and very windy this year compared to previous years at this time. The spa treatements I had were great, although pricewise they are about the same cost as here, so don't expect any bargains.( about $ 130 for an hour & half massage) Several people told me they went into town and found much cheapoer massages etc., but iIconfess i liked the ambiance at the spa itself, and I guess that is built into the price. Plus I could walk back to my room, or the pool, or wherever afterwards and continue relaxing, so for me it was worth it. Overall, we feel we got our money's worth, and are already looking forward to coming again next year, although we will try to get a 1 BR room with a balcony rather than just a studio next time , as the studio room does become a bit cramped feeling after several days.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "cleanse", "ReviewID": "UR14566151", "Content": "As RCI members this was the only hotel available during spring break. I didn't want to be in Cancun with the rowdy crowd so Playa seemed a better pick. I was nervous because it is not on the beach. We were picked up at our hotel in Cancun where we arrived the night before. The shuttle was free to the hotel but is not on the way back. We were pleased when we saw the lobby. It is open and truly unique. You will also notice the mayan style pyramid spa. Our room was wonderful. We had a one bedroom with a pull out sofa for our teenage daughter. Two double beds in the room for myself, husband and son. The room was large and well furnished. We loved the verandah and front balcony. We actually spent some time in our hotel room and usually never do because they are so small or unclean. They drive you to the beach with a shuttle van which is a 20 minute ride. It goes by quickly and the beach is very private with your much hoped for white sand with clear blue water. We had the all-inclusive and enjoyed lots of food anytime we wanted. There isn't anything to do at the beach but swim, walk, eat and tan. Both our children enjoyed it and weren't bored. We would go to the pool at the hotel afterwards to hang out till dinner and eat there in our cover-ups, very nice to not have to get dressed if you didn't want to. Our 5 yr. old could swim while waiting for dinner and sat down at the last minute to eat. Great for moms who want to relax while the kids swim... you eat. At breakfast my son made friends with the turtles and iguanas by the golf course lake and we always enjoyed the food. Walking to town was nice and we went several times. It's about 15 mins. We liked feeling that we could come and go and not be stuck at some huge hotel. I really liked the area and town. We found a dive shop there right next to the public beach, can't remember the name. Julio was our dive master and there were only the 3 of us on the boat. I wasn't expecting much, not like Cozumel anyway but it was a good dive. He took us to Tortugas and we sure saw lots of them. About 6 or 7. I touched 2 and they seemed so docile. One big turtle just let me rub his shell for quite a while. We went on a reef after that and saw tons of fish, schools of grunts, eels, a huge crab etc. We rented a car for 2 days and wished we had added a day. They packed us a lunch that we put in a cheap styrofoam cooler we bought at the super. We drove to Tulum, Akumal (visit Yal-Ku lagoon here) and snorkeled in Dos Ojos cenotes (north of and cheaper than Hidden Worlds cenotes). At Dos Ojos check out Yibran Aragon, tell him we said Hi! (Sherrie Hellickson and family from Houston) He has a little hut there where he can download the pictures he takes of you and your family snorkeling or diving. He also guides the dive trips. I have to mention the spa. Although we paid nothing for any spa treatments, just using what was free as part of our all-inclusive was fantastic! Everynight I would go to the sauna, steam room , thalsso therapy pool etc. to relax and unwind. My husband who is not usually into jacuzzi's and such even enjoyed it. My 16 yr. old climbed the rock wall and we all loved the restaurant on top. Do take advantage of it. We would go back and loved the quiet atmosphere, spa and town close by.

We were booked for a week at another place in Playa, but we decided to come a day sooner and they didn't have a room available, so we were just looking for a place to crash the first night. We found this place on Orbitz with a deal that sounded too good to be true: $189 a night for All-Inclusive! Well, when we got there, we found out that it was, in fact, not true. We're positive it said all AI when we booked it, otherwise we would have found something cheaper, but looking over my confirmation I saw that I didn't have it in writing. Oh well, lesson learned. It was still a decent price just for the room. The property is nice, new looking, clean and well maintained. Since we were only there 1 night, we didn't go to the beach club. There are 2 pools, however, that we did visit. The main pool was average and there weren't enough chairs, but the pool on the roof of the spa is fantastic. It is on the 3rd floor with a great view, and comfortable beds (better than the bed in the room) instead of lounge chairs. There are also 2 restaurants. We had lunch at the poolside grill, which also overlooks the golf course. Pretty decent sandwich and fries. We also had breakfast there. Good but kind of pricey-you could do much better for breakfast in Playa. We tried the Jazmin restaurant for dinner. They describe it as International--the night we were there they had Asian and Italian. We had Italian selections which were very good and reasonably priced (about $15 per entree), and the service was very good. Overall, a pleasant stay, but if we were staying longer we would probably have wanted a place on the beach for convenience (the shuttle only runs out 2 times in the morning and back 2 times in the PM). Also, the bed was VERY firm-I wouldn't have liked that for many more nights.

Be remembered that this Hotel Property is 5 star Property. The armchairs in the hotel lobby are almost all broken and to say the least in a very poor condition. Maintenance issues from paining problems to electric cables to broken are damaged furniture. The Housekeeping department does not use service trolleys (at least not while we were there) and do place their new towels, bed sheets and so on directly on the floor. The Guest room is of a good size however the 3 we saw were in poor conditions in respect to Quality Standards expected in a 5 star hotel. The front desk (you can look in to it from the upper floors) was pretty messy and all in full Guest view, from papers, cables and other items to the way the Front desk was set up. The Employee Attitude was ok but for sure not out going and need improvement. The F&B service was ok, but nothing very special. Overall we both were not impressed at all with the Hotel Property. We then took a close look at their Spa, the building from the outside is very impressive, a copy of an old Mexican Pyramid with different design concepts in the inside over 3 floors. Please note that this Spa is not only for hotel guest you have also quite a large number of Guests on day tours coming to the place. In principal the idea with having different design concepts within one spa if fine, however it is not fully implemented in the Spa property. Further the place need urgently a full renovation since it is very much run down in almost all aspects. The Garden area is not kept up; the waterfall is a good idea but has many damaged parts. The locker and relaxing areas are also not up to the First Impression. I am sure once a renovation took place and the Spa property is put back on track, the Spa would offer a nice experience, however at present for sure not.

Any negative review of this resort is completely misguided. How anyone can come away with anything but a love of this place is completely beyond me. We have been to Mexico on vacation at least 7 times in the last nine years and for adults looking to relax in a romantic, beautiful, quiet setting it does not get much better. Point One- The rooms are wonderful. the suites are spacious and the singles are quaint and clean and wonderfully maintained. I like a firm mattress and that's what they are. The pillows are excellent and the rooms are beautiful with mexican decorations, marble baths and excellent soft linens. The complaint about noise from the hall is semi valid. But I have never stayed in a hotel that was full to capacity with travellers from wedding parties, to families, to couples that has not had hallway noise. Most places housekeeping is knocking by 8am. here they were not starting until at least 10am. One more item here. In every hotel I have ever been to in Mexico i have wound up with bed bug bites on my feet or every where else. I came back with not one bite. Point Two- I arrived on the 12th and my wife arrived on the 14th. Claudia and the front desk was wonderful in helping me with sending a driver to pick up my wife upon her arrival. This is just a microcosim of the professionalism and service that you will experience. Polite, considerate and gracious. For gods sake tip these people and you will not have an issue. Most of service folks work for about 10 pesos an hour. Don't be cheap. When you tip on your bill the tip is split 100 different ways. Tip individuals based on the service they perform with dollars or Pesos and you will not regret it. Point Three- The grounds are beautiful and the private beach is heaven. The beach is something out of a tropical dream. Do not miss the pool on top of the spa you will feel like you are on the Mediteranean. Point Four- The All Inclusive is not really all inclusive. If you plan on eating all your meals at the Hacienda you will not be happy. The All inclusive is basic. But do not let this deter you. The Hacienda is in Playacar which is totally safe to walk around. Playa Del carmen is a 15 minute walk or a 50 peso cab ride ( 3 min ). You can eat until you are blue in the face and ready to explode in Playa. Restaurants in town can range from inexpensive to very pricey but you are on vacation so explore and enjoy the food and especially the drinks. Point Five- The breakfast service is very slow. If you are in a rush you are in trouble. this was really my only complaint. we ended up walking into town in the morning where you have multiple breakfast options that are less expensive and better tasting. Do Not miss the breakfast buffet in town at $7.40 US and it is the best deal around and fantastic. One other point. take your time i town and walk up and down 5th ave and the beach. the beah is public and the views are great and all the lttle beach hotels serve cold beer great drinks and wonderful food at very reasonable prices.

I usually look at a number of different rooms before I except one but at this hotel the first room I saw was great. Pillows and sheets were great but the bed was hard but all hotels in Mexico are known for there hard mattresses. The beach was a 20 minute ride but well worth it once you got there breath taking. The hotel food was good and the beach food was good and service great. Don't be cheap when you tip they work hard and put in long hours and deserve to be treated fairly and for a little extra they will go out of there way to please you. Hotel is a 25 minute walk to town or a $5 taxi ride your choice but save your walking time and take a taxi to 5th Avenue because you will do alot of walking there. So many shops on 5th Avenue and so many eating places our favorites were La Parilla for lunch, Blue Lobster and Resturante de Bruno for dinner. Different experience from Cancun you have to try it.

The actual buildings were extremely well done, with the architectural theme being Mayan. The hotel is 20 minutes away from the beach, and they only have a bus that leaves twice in the morning to go there. The staff is very unprofessional. There are two restaurants, the Jazmin and the Iguana Cafe. At both the waiters would forget or misinterpret orders, and the first thing they asked was your room number, so they could charge you an outrageous tip being in the neighborhood of 20%. The meals themselves were expensive, with a simple plate of fruit costing $8.00. The staff could hardly speak english, and this made communication difficult. I can speak a little spanish, and the first night there, I saw our waiters mock us behind our back. The staff in general seemed lethargic and unresponsive. Often they would just stand around talking amongst themselves. Being 15, there was nothing at all for kids to do. No activities, no events, and no other kids. If you are reading this and your in high school, DO NOT GO, THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. I might recommend the hotel if you are going for a honeymoon, or if you are elderly and want to play golf in a nice quiet atmosphere. The all inclusive is a bad joke. You have a bevy of other fees to pay, and the enforced tipping will cost you probably more than the meals in the first place. At the Iguana Cafe, it will take at least an hour and a half to get your food. It is slightly less longer than the Jazmin. The pool and hot tub are nice, I just never saw a single person use either one in my entire 6 day stay their. On the plus side, the beach is incredible. Our bathroom did not have a door handle, and they replaced it after two days. Also, the shower had only cold water for a day, because they had \"run out of propane\".

First of all, with only 73 rooms, they overbooked by no less than 7 rooms, so I spent my first night at the Holiday Inn which looks like a hospital. This is the first time it's ever happened to me, and I had already paid for the room for 8 nights! But misery loves company, and they overbooked/ displaced many other people. When I checked in I was given NO information. There is room service available but they don't tell you. The room has no instructions for phone calls and they don't tell you anything. The second restaurant (which is only open for dinner, not lunch) is actually in a different building, the spa which is next door (spa entrance is NOT included in your hotel stay and it's $50 just to go In). They have no activities, they don't tell you when or where meals are, nothing, nothing, nothing. The rooms are beautiful, and have great acoustics -- meaning you can hear everything!!! I was kept up by people in the next room -- the studios are not actually separate, they are bedrooms which are closed off from the suites. I got no peace, even after having the security guard knock on the door and asking them to quiet down. I was woken up every night either by them, or by a baby howling somewhere else. There is no rest to be had in this hotel, though the room was gorgeous with 20 foot arched ceilings. Food: boring,tateless. Orange juice pasteurized and watered down. Steak tasteless, all shrimp was mushy and nothing ever came hot even though most of it was cooked on a outside grill. (Even when it rained they did not open the dining room to let people inside to eat, they had us outside in the rain eating, and no I am not kidding and yes, I did ask them to open it). Every meal I had outside of the resort had more taste, although every meal I had outside the resort made me sick. Service: None existent. The head receptionist, Jessica would not even book a shuttle to the airport for me. (The hotel has their own shuttle which costs $60, a private taxi is $45 and other shuttles are $18). When she called and the hotel's shuttle was not available (she had not told me the price!!), she refused to help me any further. She and the other receptionists spent most of their time on the phone, it was nearly impossible to reach an operator from your room. Tour desk: They booked me on a $39 tour, where the entrance fee was only $2, and taxis about $7 each way. They booked me on another expensive tour where you have to be up at 5:30 a.m. and I waited and the bus never came. When I came back to the hotel, she got angry, called the company but I had to ask and go back twice for a refund and she never apologized. I asked to be referred to a time share and they wouldn't do it, but I recommend everyone else to go to a time share, because you get several expensive tours for free when you do go. Waiters: They invented the word greedy. I am a very good tipper, and at an all inclusive I would normally leave a large amount at the end of the week. The waiters instructed me to put it on the tab at each meal -- and a particularly greedy one -- his name started with an \"O\", instructed me to give him cash so he wouldn't have to split it with his fellow waiters. All of the waiters hover and stare at you as you write out the tip on the \"checks\" that you have to sign after all meals and drinks. If they don't see what you wrote, they open it as they take it off the table. But don't expect a \"thank you\" even if you tip 20 or 25%. Everyone at this place is not just out to put money in their own pocket, they are out to have you leave all your money in Mexico. There is really nothing to do at this hotel. The gardening staff refused to turn on the hot tub for me, there are no activities posted. There is certainly nothing to do here in the rain. The good part is that it is in a beautiful wealthy suburb (you have to pass through 2 guard posts to get into the area, which tells me it's not so safe), and it's only a $5 ride from the downtown area. I would not want to stay in the downtown area because aside from one street, Avenida Quinta, the rest of Playa del Carmen is squalid and rundown. I see no reason to recommend this hotel to anyone. Go somewhere bigger with more activities, better food (there were 3 meals a day, no snacks at this \"all inclusive\"). They take the cheap way out wherever possible here. They only have one small swimming pool, and only about 12 lounge chairs so that on sunny days it is still a challenge to get out early enough to get a lounger. Thumbs down.

I'm travel agent and we stayed with friends who are \"V.I.P.'s\" with HVR (something about points packages or RCI) I don't know their specific deal. We got a deal on the room and stayed 1 week. This being my 4th trip to Mexico, I am always open to trying new places/things. However, I can say that either I have become extremely spoiled from past visits, or my expectations are just too high. I have generally stayed within the Palace chain and this could well be the issue. Yes, it is very secluded and quiet. Only 1 pool, and 2 restaurants. The only thing that would cap off the quiet and seclusion is no kids, or at least making parents maintain their kids. Instead of there being 200 or 300 people at multiple pools, as with larger hotels, it was nice to be on of only 6 or 8 people at the pool. 1 of the restaurants (Jasmin) is INCREDIBLY expensive ($11 for an omelette, $8 for a fruit plate) - it was nothing to spend $35 USD for breakfast. A bit steep to me. The service was EXCELLENT. With the staff at HVR, guests want for absolutely nothing at any time. Sebatain, Flavio and Charly especially work very hard at keeping guests happy. My room was what they call a studio. Small room with a bed, bath and closet. No dresser or any where else to put clothes. Our friends were in the Monarch. They were a party of 8 and had a full service kitchen with basic utensils provided. Nice suite. The staff even cleaned up their dishes if they left them in the sink. A few things with our room. We could not regulate the temp in our room to save our lives. It was either freexing, or on the border of raining in the room from the moisture. No happy medium. The honor bar (fridge) was well stocked with $2 cans of pop and $6 tiny bottles of booze, etc. We moved this stuff to put items in for our week long stay only to fin the fridge was absolutely filthy. We had to literally peel items off the bottom of the fridge. I'm also used to the noise levels at hotels. Like hospitals, they are notorious for not allowing you to get any rest. The HVR takes this to an entirely new level. The windows in our room, which was on a corner, might as well have not been there at all. They were a slide style window similar to one in a Dr office reception area, just as thin, and rattled in their track when anyone talked or walked by. Folks might as well have just been standing in our room. We will definitely go back to Mexico, and would return to HVR if for nothing else to see the staff. I would definitely select a different room type/location though. For the most part, I will be returning to the Palace chain resorts that offer adult or couples only visitors. Yes, there can be a TON of people on these resorts but their service is unsurpassed on every level. Next stop, Moon Palace.

Two restaurants, Jazmin (sit down a la carte) and Iguana Grill (by the pool and also a la carte). In our opinion, the food was very good, healthy, very well presented and appropriate quantity. This is not a \"stuff your face\" style buffet. This is a classy sit down restaurant. The food orders would take longer than what one is used to in North America, but that was the same in all other restaurants that we went to. This is Mexico, not USA or Canada. Embrace the culture, lower your expectations and you'll have a great vacation. I would not recomend it for families or young couples looking for activities. There are none.
