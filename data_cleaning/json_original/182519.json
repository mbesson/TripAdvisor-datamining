What more could you need?! Moda Hotel has quickly become my home base when I'm in town for a concert at the Orpheum or Commodore Ballroom. My only complaint is that whoever looks after their email correspondence isn't terribly concerned with replying to inquiries. Ever. I made a couple of attempts to contact the hotel via email but never received a response.

Then we parked and rolled our luggage to the hotel. It was pleasant, priced well and close walking to everything. We walked to shopping, walked to the restaurant we had dinner at, back to the hotel and then to breakfast in the morning. That was great. The room was very nice and large. The only two negatives were the TV in the bedroom did not work. There is another TV in the sitting area. And the placement of the hair dryer is inconvenient. On a wall where the toilet is in the way, so it was hard to dry my hair. Other than that....no complaints. It was priced well and great location. I would stay here again.

When I got to the room the temperature was only 14 degrees celsius and the window was open. It was noticeably cold as soon as you walked in, but the front desk staff said nothing. I cranked the heat but took forever to heat up. This must be a common problem because there was a portable electric heater in the room. Being a suite, the heater was too small to heat the room. Next morning I plugged in the iron and must have popped a breaker because the electricy for the entire room shut down. When I went down to check out and the front desk girl asked how my stay was.

The worst part was the floor had a very steep lean into the centre of the room which meant that it was impossible to sit at the narrow skinny desk without the feeling of sliding of your chair. After of couple of hours putting up with this I decided to raise it with the gentleman on the front desk who was very empathetic and decided to find me a better room. After reviewing 2 other rooms it was clear that they all had the same problem (well at least on the 3rd floor) and this all related to the age of the hotel apparently. Eventually I was given a corner 'King' room which was identical to the other rooms I viewed with the exception of a larger bed and larger floor area - other than that everything was identical. In this room the desk was located in a different part of the from and didn't have a ridiculous slope. The bed however sloped from the back to front which proved to annoying when I went to sleep because I could feel all the blood rushing to my head - the easy solution was to sleep with my head at the tail of the bed which now cause the blood to rush to my feet and resulted in a similar sensation of sleeping in one of those old business class beds on planes that 'don't' fully recline. Apart from my bad room the restaurant on the ground floor was fantastic with excellent service and apparently the chef had worked at the famous 'River Cafe' in London which I could believe as the food was very good and they served a great selection of wines from the Okanagan Valley (which I love). The more casual dining restaurant were I had breakfast on each day was very hit and miss in regards to serve. On the first morning I wasn't offered water and after the waitress delivered my coffee and granola disappeared and never came back to offer more coffee, water or maybe a glass of juice. The next morning the service was the exact opposite and worthy of a 10. Just goes to show how service is key and had not been for my $10 breakfast voucher I wouldn't have given them a second chance. So would I stay here again? Only if there was nothing better available. I will definitely come back to the restaurant when I visit Van again.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and neat vintage building!\u201d", "Author": "Michelle W", "ReviewID": "UR122189564", "Content": "Could walk everywhere from here...Stanley Park, waterfront, Gas Town, and Yale Town.

The rooms don't have a fridge, which isn't big deal for most, but we like to bring a few drinks and snacks with us. The sound deadening is minimal.

They do not give you easily-found instruction on their website regarding their own parking arrangement in this parkade. Even with instruction, it is quite a hassle. You must first check in in order to get access to their section. Which means that you must somehow park your vehicle somewhere first in order to check in. There is no valet parking, which poses a problem because they are also situated on a busy street. Thus, you cannot just pull up in front of the hotel and park for a few minutes while you hop out and check in. It's extremely inconvenient. When I mentioned this to the lady who checked us in, her attitude was nothing short of rude. I had to tell her to watch her tone, which then got us the cold shoulder and even more attitude while she checked us in. She was no warmer the following day.

We very much appreciated the free wi-fi, and we used it quite often. We also made use of the breakfast vouchers that came with our rooms. We had breakfast every morning at UVA. It was never crowded and the service was friendly. Our rooms also came with discount cards for the properties restaurants. We had dinner at Red Card one night. I wasn't a huge fan of the soup I had, but the pizza was great. Our waitress noticed I didn't love the soup, and took it off our bill. That was really nice of her! The parking for the hotel is actually 1 block down. After checking in, we were directed to the parking ramp and we were able to find it without a problem. We were happy to have in/out privileges. The location of the Moda is perfect! Everything is within walking distance - including a grocery store, coffee shops, Robson Street, fancy restaurants, fast-food restaurants, etc. We would 100% stay at the Moda again.

I had high hopes for the Moda given the great info and photos on its website. Our check-in was fine, albeit a little frazzled. The room was quaint and pretty much as photographed. Things started to go downhill later that night when we asked the front desk for some ice with which to chill a bottle of wine. The gal at the front had trouble with her English and just could not understand what we needed or why (she eventually told us to ask at the hotel bar). So, relatively minor. We then discovered - in the middle of the night - just how thin the walls were as we could hear every detail of the partiers coming and going in the hallways, upstairs, and next door. At 6am the following morning our neighbour's cellphone alarm started going off and didn't stop. At 7am (it was a Saturday), city construction started TEARING UP THE STREET right outside our window! There'd been no notice or warning from hotel mgmt, though they claimed not to have known themselves. We should've requested a room change, but thought surely the next night would be better. It was worse. Our neighbour turned on their TV - loud - and left it on all night. Apparently they weren't even there. At 5:30am we finally called the front desk and the man basically said we'd have to deal with it because he was the only one there and we'd have to wait until someone else showed up for work. I suggested he CALL the room and he said he would. After 45 minutes we called again to follow up because the TV was still on and we hadn't heard a phone call next door. He insisted that he'd called several times and that there was no answer. HE LIED. The walls are paper thin, and when he eventually did call the ringer was twice as loud as the TV. Believe it or not, he actually CUT THE POWER to our suites to get the TV off. Rather than knocking on the door, announcing himself and using a key to enter, he cut the power!! So our room had no lights and we had to call down to the front desk later that morning to ask them to TURN THE POWER ON in our room. The whole thing was like a circus - totally ridiculous. We left Vancouver that morning annoyed and exhausted. I couldn't possibly ever recommend the Moda to anyone. And PS - they don't provide Skoah toiletries as advertised on the website.

Well I arrived as I thought at 2:30pm and the lady at the desk informed me my room was not ready and the housekeeper just went up to clean my room due to a late check-out. She was very friendly and very nice. She took me up to a different suite which was inside the hotel (I had booked the room I booked because it was in a building across the street and I like not feeling like i am in a hotel). The was very nice and it was a good enough size considering I was by myself. When we arrived on the floor I was on there was plastic on the floor and other construction materials. She told me they would have it all cleaned up and nothing will happen on the weekend. They did clean everything up except for the plastic and some mattress' and stuff on the other side of the hallway. It never really affected my stay though... just pure vanity factor considering the price you pay you would expect it to present a little better. My room was nice and the bathroom was amazing and the bed was extremely comfortable. The only thing I have to complain about the room was the fact it did not smell very nice at all... It kind of had a cat litter smell or something and I opened the window before I invited friends over before a night of going out because it was kind of embarrassing. But it was not a nauseating make me complain, and cause a scene type of thing. You can tell it was just because the building is old and probably didn't help with all the renovations going on in the other rooms on the floor. Because the hotel is old the walls and floors are very thin. I never had issues myself because I was on the top floor but I did receive a phone call from a noise complaint because I guess my friends and I were to loud hanging out and chatting in my living room before we left for the night. When I came back from a wonderful night out my two friends came back with me to wait for their ride. The lobby door was locked and the guy at the door was very slow at opening them and it was very cold outside. We started walking up the stairs and he informed me that the hotel does not allow guests in my room because I only have one bed. I had never heard of this before... I work in a hotel and we don't have such rules. So I questioned it and he got very rude. He started to get angry and say they had to wait outside because they aren't guests of the hotel. I informed him... I am a paying guest of this hotel and the fact of how he is treating me was very rude I haven't encountered such rudeness. He continued to repeat himself saying my bedroom only has one bed so im only aloud one extra person. I told him they arent staying the night but their ride isn't expected for awhile because we left earlier than what we thought and they have to use the bathroom and such and didn't want to sit in the lobby. He continued to be very rude and \"called the police\" and threatened to kick me out because I was not going to my room and because they were not leaving the lobby. I found this very shocking and very rude because working in a hotel myself I don't like dealing with this kind of stuff at other hotels because I know what it is like but he just continued to pick a fight. I asked for his name so I could talk to someone in the morning and he said it doesn't matter what my name is sir because it won't matter. At this point I was getting extremely angry so I gave my friends money to take a cab home and I went up to my room. Even though I had this unfortunate event I would stay here again. The location was wonderful and the rooms are great. I never even had to take a cab to the hotel as there is a sky-train from the airport directly there with only a blocks walk. I did take a cab to the airport as I was running behind and it cost me $30.00. If you do stay here I would suggest staying in a Moda Suite as that is the one I stayed in and I saw into other rooms and they are way to small for the cost and for the mere 20.00 difference or whatever the money is worth it. Their symphony vita suites are across the road in a apartment building and they have a cocktail area. If you don't want the trouble of a vacation rental but still want to be segregated I'd stay there. Though they must be limited on them because I was not able to stay in the one I booked.

Walking in, I was impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the front desk. The lobby is nothing much to look at and getting on the tiny elevator I noticed the carpet was dirty and the metal on the walls had not been wiped down. Based upon my initial impression, the room was a pleasant surprise. I love the decor, minimalistic, red wall, black and white art, nice big picture window, flat screen TV, wireless internet. The room itself I would give an 8. However, there was so much noise from the street and the late night carousing outside I couldn't fall asleep at all. I should have gotten a clue from the sleep mask and earplugs on the bed when I first walked in. In addition, the walls seem to be thin as paper because I could hear the man in the next room clearing his throat all night long. I can't wear earplugs, so I just had to suffer through. Hope I can sleep tonight! In addition to the noise problem I was put off by the construction on my floor. Yesterday I couldn't even find the elevator door because it was blocked by shelving units. I literally had to squeeze around them to reach the button. And I don't know what kind of room the previous poster had, but I had no cookies or bottled water in my room. The area around the hotel is not very upscale. In general things seem a little run down. The theater, although it was restored in 1977, looks shabby from the outside (the inside is nice however). There are alleyways I would not want to venture into. I was surprise at the amount of litter on the street and the number of homeless camped out on the steps of public buildings and on every street corner. The concert, \"Music of the Night\", starring Eric Kunze and directed by Bramwell Tovey was fabulous and was the highlight of the trip so far. Looking forward to another performance tonight!

It is also the most reasonable of all the boutique hotels in VanCity. There were quite a few flaws with the hotel, but the staff was very apologetic, compensated us adequately and treated us well. There is hope that they will soon work out the kinks. We at first booked the Moda hotel at a rate of $219 for Saturday night and $199 for Sunday. So when I saw the same room on Expedia for $120, I grabbed it and called the hotel to cancel my direct reservation. Woah - big mistake. Upon arrival, they were discounting all the rooms to $99 because the promised air conditioning was not working. I was aware that the A/C might be an issue from previous Tripadvisor posts, but apparently they were promising the new system to be working by this time. The entire place appeared to be half finished, with such charming features as missing ceiling tiles and huge industrial fans failingly attempting to blow cool air into the halls during the day. The biggest annoyance was that the one slow elevator was out of order for the entire duration of our stay. The room was very hot the first night, even with the windows wide open, but the second and third nights were sufficiently cool that the lack of A/C was not a bother. After I complained that the Expedia rate was higher than the rate they were quoting, one of the staff members attempted to make amends by trying to cancel one of the nights with Expedia, allowing the hotel to charge me the lower rate. She really went out of her way to do this, spending over an hour on the phone with Expedia. She also wrote us a breakfast voucher for the difference in rates at my suggestion. Some reviewers also complained about street noise - if you request a room facing the back, you should not have a problem - there are large HVAC units from an adjacent building that will drown out the loud streets. It's also nice that the windows actually open. I imagine it is a rare day in Vancouver when you need A/C anyway. The staff also duly discounted our rate further upon checkout due to the continued problems at the hotel. All in all, we liked the place, and felt our final rate was very fair given the troubles.

It got really annoying, and frankly, made us wonder if there should be some sign up informing us of how many people can be on one floor at one point. Service was awful. The receptionist was cold and snobbish and that attitude was consistent, even though the person attending the reception changed.

The motel was Excellent surpassing all our expectations of fabulous. The staff was super friendly and helpful providing with the best service. The accomodations at the Moda were SUPERB, Clean, and trendy. The hotel 's location is in the heart of downtown, we bought a 2 day pass $35 Red Trolley and had no parking worries. The motel is just across the front door of the Vancouver Symphony Concert Hall. We were able to literally cross the street and buy rush tickets for $15 to see the philharmonic orchestra's finale performance, then staff recommended and printed out a fabulous pizza eatery (Lombardo's) just a block away. The Moda Hotel is in the heart of downtown, we were able to hop on the Old Red Trolley just one block away and visit all main sightseeing attractions and more (Aquarium, Chinese Gardens, Stanley Park, Chinatown). I was debating wether to stay at a bed and breakfast, but this hotel/motel wons hands down. There is a wonderful place for breakfast 2 blocks away (The Whitespot) that was delish.

The other reviews mention the noise level from the street, we roomed on the third floor towards the back and yes during the week there is trash pickup/dumpsters.

It's a great atmosphere professionals getting together for an after dinner wine,not a loud obnoxious bar!.

The Place - The Hotel itself is smaller than the site, but i think that in itself created the intimate feeling i was looking for. I felt like i was valued as a guest, and that the entire hotel had time for my personal needs. The noise around the hotel was quite loud, but it is in the dowtown core of Vancouver and the crowds and construction are merely the experience. ( I don't see people complaining when they go to New york or other huge cities.) The People- I absolutely loved the staff at the Moda. I can't remember the last time i have gone to a hotel and had a personal conversation and remember the names of the entire staff. Chris, Ivanah, Andrea, and the latest hire Ryan were amazing. Their knowledge of the city and the 'in's and out's' of Vancouver amazed me.

It's more fashionable than a Holiday Inn yet less expensive than a big chain property, and for that alone it deserves 4 stars. I did have two complaints about the hotel. The first was that our room (434) was always quite hot, often much hotter than it was outside. Vancouver did have a bit of a \"heat wave\" this past weekend (relatively scorching temperatures in the upper 70's), but I think that our room was located next to some kind of heat source that made it mildly uncomfortable. There was a nice fan in the room (which I prefer to air conditioning), but even my fiance who is always cold was complaining that it was toasty. My bigger complaint was with the staff. They were perfectly polite, and in all fairness they do seem overworked. When we were checking out on Monday morning there was just one person working the front desk who had to deal with everything - luggage, incoming reservations, checking us out, etc. There's no reason that the hotel can't have two staff at the front desk at all times. It was even more frustrating that the already small lobby had a concierge booth yet no concierge, so why waste the valuable and limited space with the booth???? My two specific complaints about the staff involved a woman whose name I didn't get and a front desk agent named Philippe. I had asked the latter for advice on how to get from the hotel to Gastown by public transportation. Well the first thing that he messed up was not telling us that it was in walking distance - really only about 10 minutes and less than 10 blocks. The second problem was that he told us that a taxi would cost about 10 dollars which was also ridiculous. We did take a couple of other cab rides over longer distances for less money. But the most annoying part was that he took almost 15 minutes to go online and get us relatively simple bus directions and then get us change for the bus. While we appreciated his efforts, by the time he gave us our change and directions they were for a bus that was scheduled to arrive at 4:55...and by then it was already after 5:00. My bigger complaint was about an obnoxious woman who I assume was the manager, hence no point in complaining directly to the hotel. When we arrived on Saturday morning she was working there along with 2 other staff trying to handle some customer service issues (which in their defense seemed to definitely be the faults of the customer, not the hotel). Anyway she was just condescending and passive-aggressive to the other staff. At one point she asked one of them (it actually might have been Philippe) if they were busy, which he clearly was.

A boutique hotel with minimalist and classy decor. Ultra clean. Coffee maker in room with Numi green tea. Standard hotel room blanket..that icky fuzzy one, but nice bedspread and sheets. The Queen room is very small, but the decor and cleanliness compensate. It is indeed noisy, and the view is not a plus, but that will only bother some. I couldn't quite figure out if the room has a heating system. Our heat was not on and it was a bit cold. For the summer they seem to have a fan... For a short stay, it's just right.

The location is excellent - walking distance from shopping and going-out area. Rooms are not as small as I expected from previous reviews, I found the room perfectly fine and stayed in smaller rooms in boutique hotels - but they are probably smaller by North American standards. With modern furniture, great colors, flat screen etc the place has a stylish feel and (despite being not very expensive) does not have a boutique-hotel-on the-cheap feel. Only negative I found was that there is no air conditioning and the heating is controlled for the whole floor. When we arrived the room was somewhat cold, but then they put the heating up and it was no problem. Windows can be opened which is a plus. Regarding noise - we had a room to the back and it was okay. However, windows are not double-glazed and I imagine rooms to the main road can be noisy.

The hotel is clean. The staff is incredibly nice, helpful, friendly and went out of their way to be accommodating! The location is perfect for downtown Vancouver -- within walking distance of several theatres and a block away from the bars, restaurants, Robson, shopping and clubs of Granville Avenue. The hotel is within several city blocks of most of the major downtown attractions, including Yaletown, Gastown, the arena and Chinatown. The bus service in downtown is a bit pricey, but runs everywhere and often. Moda Hotel doesn't have WiFi, but has great free high speed internet by ethernet. The hotel has been recently renovated and I love the new decor! The rooms are stark, modern and clean. Some might find them a little small, but this is an old building. The beds were firm and very comfortable. Even the pillows were better than average. Previous comments have mentioned the noise from the pub that used to be downstairs. For our stay in Oct 2007, the pub had been closed for a while and club noise wasn't an issue. Unfortunately, there is A LOT of construction in Downtown Vancouver, which is fairly loud starting around 8:00 am (except Sundays) or so. Not a problem for us as it made an excellent alarm clock.... I suspect this is a problem all over downtown. The price was among the lower of the hotels we looked at, but this hotel was by far the best value within any price range. I'll be recommending this hotel to my friends and it will definitely be our first hotel of choice when we return to Vancouver.

When checking out after several days we wanted to leave our luggage as well before moving on, we had to hear numerous complaints about how everyone wanted to do that and how inconvenient it was for them!
