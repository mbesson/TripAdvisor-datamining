We wanted a reasonably priced hotel in this part of London and had a two night stay. Our room in the extension was a good size, very clean and comfortable and the bathroom, which had a shower but no bath, was modern and very clean.It was very quiet with no road noise. I liked the fact that the long passage to the room was wood look flooring rather than carpet which can soon look dirty in some cheaper hotels. The cooked breakfast which you order when you arrive at breakfast was freshly cooked and the bacon delicious. It arrived very quickly and the breakfast staff were very efficient. The continental breakfast is a bit dull,(boring cereals and not very nice yoghourts and only white bread) but the rate for the hotel was so reasonable you cannot expect gourmet food. We used buses to get to every where we wanted to go as we had our bus passes and we enjoy the journey to town even though it can be slow in the traffic. However if time is important then it is very near the railway station. Niggles - only one towel and one pillow each provided - perhaps could have asked for another but didn't try and no bath mat and I found it slippery on the tiles. There is no telephone in the room and the hotel one was out of order but since most people have mobile phones this is not really a problem.
