Smoked salmon on the breakfast buffet is also a nice touch.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBasic, but terrific breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "sagethyme", "ReviewID": "UR42747430", "Content": "This hotel is old and has some really queer decor going on inside!! But don't let it put you off , the rooms are just fine, maybe just a bit worn. It's clean, tidy, things work, and the breakfast spread is a great way to begin your day in Berlin! Location maybe not the best, but metro is efficient and reliable.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cfine\u201d", "Author": "Joanie881", "ReviewID": "UR20867094", "Content": "I called the hotel to make a reservation and they didn't require credit card info which made me nervous. I reconfirmed the reservation before we left and they said we were fine but it seemed a little weird esp. since their English wasn't very good. It was just one nite and it was fine but seemed to be more of a hostel in much of a hotel. And there must have been some big groups cuz you couldn't even deal with the crowd at breakfast. The room itself was very clean, shower was decent altho small and hard to maneuver in. I was worried about being in the first room on the first floor but it wasn't noisy at all. Maybe I was just a moron but couldn't make a phone call from our room and the semi morose receptionist wasn't much help. The location was good for that part of town there and it was just a 10 min walk to the Zoo station for the bus to the airport.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Arrival", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d631583-Reviews-Hotel_Arrival-Berlin.html", "Price": "$56 - $118*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Lietzenburgerstrasse 30</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10789</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "631583", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/49/f2/49f28695cea913344e1d64c2644765833large.jpg"}}
