There are wonderful shops near by, of different types, as souvenir shops, leather shops and various restaurants! Again I assure you that the best thing about this hotel is its great location and its reasonable price. You can spend nice time till late at night in the area around without worrying about the late transport. The hotel can be reached easily by metro as it is about 2 minutes walk from Gran Via metro station. Its proximity to the metro station facilitates transport to farther visiting touristic places. You can also ride the tour bus from the near Gran Via street and enjoy the tour.

The hostal is located on the the 5th floor of the building and has a great patio which is nice if you pick up food to go and don't want to sit in your room. The staff is very helpful and I really liked the system they have of requesting that you leave your key behind when you go out - good to keep track (esp in the evenings) of who is yet to come back. When you pickup your key and head to where the rooms are located - there is a door which the front desk will buzz you through - makes a solo female traveller feel at ease. The room itself was spacious (at least for myself as one person) and came with clean towels, a luggage rack, a safe, a desk (nice addition) and was comfortable but don't expect luxury. Also for both of the nights that we stayed I noticed there was a lot of noise from outside at night which without earplugs would have made it impossible to sleep - so make sure you bring some if staying here.

We got ourselves a quad room, which was located at the end of of the corridor (perfectly out of the way). I really like the room because it feels as if the person who designed and set it up really put in lots of effort and thoughts to make the room sweet and welcoming. There are a window, side tables, mirror, wardrobe, chairs, luggage rack, a safe, 2 plug points, a small tv, a 1-horse power air-cond and free wifi (get password from reception). The attached bathroom is superb- again, kudos to the designer. Packets of shampoo, soap bars, towels and toilet paper are provided. There is also a toilet just outside the room, so it can be used during emergency when the attached bathroom is occupied. Being on the fifth floor means you need to take the lift up and it can only accommodate 3 people at a time. There is a small but nice reception and the guy who welcomed us was very friendly. He explained the security features: a locked door before the corridor towards the rooms (reception will open it for you). Walking along the corridor from the reception to the room leaves you with a sense of being at home because it's very thoughtfully decorated and nicely laid out with flowers, paintings and chairs. After being out the whole day, it's great to have such a homey place to come back to.

There are several internet cafes and ATM's close by. I had drinks two nights at the Stop Bar down the street and got to practice my Spanish with a visiting businessman who was astonished that a single American girl could stumble upon his favorite watering hole. There are plenty of great inexpensive restaurants and bars within a few blocks. For the price this is a wonderful, clean, safe place to stay just 2 blocks from the subway. The room I stayed in is tiny but has a nice small bathroom and large window and was plenty of space for me to sleep. At first I was concerned that the hosts didn't want me to take the room key with me but on the first night I was there I realized that it was so they would know when all of their guests were in for the night and they could lock the door.
