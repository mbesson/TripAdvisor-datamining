There is a tourist bus circuit which stops outside for those who want to see the sites. The staff were helpful and polite. There are trolleys for your bags to take to your room as they dont have a doorman, which i personally are happier with than having somebody else do it for me.

The huge disadvantage is the lack of wireless network, there's only cable internet which also wasn't working very well and also not with all computers. This shouldn't happen in my opinion. Also the staff at the reception weren't very interested in their clients...lovely and super friendly cleaning ladies though! Also try not to get a room next to the elevators, as walls and doors are very thin and sleeping, especially during the weekend is rather a challenge.

I saw a rate of $99/night for a 1queen bed room online & called in to get more specifics. I told the guy I'd call back to book it & when I did I got a different girl offering me their regular rate. When I said I was told $99 earlier she said she'd book it for that price. So, check online first! I'm sure if I didn't bring it up she wouldn't have mentioned the cheaper rate. Parking is $15.. $20 after taxes + fees, but it's reasonable considering you can leave your car parked till 3pm the next day (even after 11am check-out). When we arrived we were told they required a pre-auth of the total room charge + an extra $200 pre-auth. I wish I had known about this beforehand because I didn't have enough credit on my card, but luckily they accepted cash. While they are not actually charging anything they are still withholding money that I would've liked to have during our night out. We were booked into a room on the 11th floor. The view at night was great, though in the morning we realized we were looking at a building under construction. Behind it, though, was the beautful city. The rooms are VERY big & spacious. They look exactly like the pictures on the website & the traveller photos available here. The closet is amazing; it has a built-in storage unit with shelves & places to hang your cothes. There is also a desk, a flat screen tv, a fridge, & a coffee/teak maker. The bathroom itself is fairly small, but the entire room is very clean & polished nicely. The walk-out balcony is great for getting fresh air too. The service was great.. the front desk staff was extremely nice even though I showed disappointment at their pre-auth requirement. The weekend after I booked two rooms with 2 queens each ($109/night). Though I was told the hotel can't guarantee requests, I emailed & spoke to a rep about getting the highest rooms available at our rate & side by side. I was quite happy that I got exactly what I wanted- 2 rooms on the 14th floor right beside each other. Rooms up until the 14th floor are considered standard regular rooms, & anything higher is considered deluxe & more expensive.

We arrived at about 9 PM on a Sunday night and I was slightly surprised that the receptionist asked for my credit card before even say 'hello' to me. However, my request for a room on a high floor had been satisfied (I had emailed in advance) and we were given a room on the 27th floor. The room was huge and impeccably clean, with modern decor and the most comfortable bed one could ask for. The bathroom, as some have commented, are a bit small but nothing out of the ordinary for us Europeans who are used to this. I would imagine that maybe a person of a very large size might struggle a bit. For us, it was absolutely fine. The views from the 27th floor are nothing short of spectacular, as you can see from some of the photos that I am attaching. That, in itself, is the main reason why you should stay in this hotel - because at that price, I don't think you'll be able to find anything better. The restaurant/bistro closes really early, at 9 PM - that includes the 'bar'. I think that's really too early for a hotel. We arrived at about 9 PM on a Sunday night but couldn't get anything to eat. That night we tried the 'Shenanigans' Irish Pub which is also part of the hotel, but walked straight out as it was just too depressing (it reminded me of the bar in the Simpsons) and smelt of stale beer and dirty carpets. The food at the bistro was ok - we had breakfast there every day and lunch and dinner on a couple of occasions. The staff were very attentive and friendly; the food was ok, although on one occasion in my salad I noticed that a tomato had some kind of black mould - not so good. The biggest disappointment with the Blue Horizon is that THERE IS NO WIFI. Yes, on their website they say 'Free High Speed Internet', but it's 'wired' i.e. Ethernet and it still doesn't seem to work. I had taken an old Mac laptop with me, as well as an iPod Touch and iPhone. I tried to connect the iBook to the Ethernet but it just would not work. The instructions provided were useless, not only based on Windows XP but also incomplete. I am fairly computer literate and normally, with an Ethernet connection, you just plug in the cable and it should work. But didn't. I didn't bother asking Reception because they always seemed really busy - the reception area is very small and queues seemed to be quite long. Luckily there is a Starbucks round the corner so I was able to get online from there, but I cannot believe that in 2011 a hotel still offers no wifi - making most devices like tablets pretty useless. The 'Business Centre' consists of ONE DESK with an old looking PC which at one point had a sign saying 'out of order' taped to the monitor. Although to be fair, it was then removed. The 'Business Centre' is on the narrow corridor leading to the bistro, offering no privacy whatsoever. We did not use it. Location -wise, we found Robson Street an ideal place for our stay, because it has shops, restaurants and everything else you may possibly want/need and it's within walking distance of the rest of the city. I get the impression that The Blue Horizon should be marketed more like a 'residence' or a 'motel', because you do get the impression that it is run by ghosts. You never see a housekeeper or any members of staff outside of the reception/bistro area. It shows that it used to be a block of apartments. If you are looking for a hotel that offers plenty of amenities, room service etc, this is probably not the right place for you. The bedrooms however were extremely comfortable. We went at a very quiet time of the year so we experienced little noise, except on our last morning, when some 'neighbours' were having a shower and - I swear - it sounded as if the water was coming down inside our room. But I have yet to find a hotel room that is really quiet. I would recommend this hotel for price, convenience and, above all, the absolutely fantastic views of Vancouver.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel and great location\u201d", "Author": "sportsdad1967", "ReviewID": "UR120277870", "Content": "Spent a week in Vancouver at a convention at Canada Place.

It was not her fault - she managed somehow! She even managed to sort out a foul-up by 'management', in that our two rooms were on different floors in spite of requesting close-together rooms. She managed to get us together with only a couple of minutes delay - well done! Management need to seriously look at what they expect from their staff. All the 'managers' we saw seemed to be swanning around doing nothing but harrassing their staff. That apart, we had a pleasant visit; the rooms were large clean and comfortable and as with virtually everywhere we stayed in Canada, the beds were extremely comfortable. In spite of being on Robson Street and only 14 floors up, we were njot in the least bothered by noise, either from within the hotel of from the street. On the first night, we ate in the hotel's own restaurant, Inlets. We enjoyed it so much that we went back there on the last night (only stayed 2 nights). The food was excellent and the waiting staff fast and friendly. Breakfast was good too, well cooked and presenteed.On the last morning, Wilson had the fruit because he didn't want to eat too much - mistake!! he was given so much that he couldn't finish All in all, a comfortable stay in Vancouver and we would be quite happy to return to the Blue Horizon.

Oh well we thought inconsiderate but we were soon asleep again. On our last night we were woken again by the same people who ended up in the room next door to us. We were awake from 3.30am to after 5am because these people continued to \"party up\" both in their room and outside on the balcony where they were smoking (in a non smoking hotel) I was so frustrated that I complained to reception twice. The first time they sent security up and although we could hear the security guy knocking on their door the inhabitants of the room were making so much noise they couldnt hear the knocking. Security did speak to them twice regarding the noise but they took no notice and were making as much noise again before security would have got back to the elevator. I mentioned our disappointment at the front desk early the next morning when checking out, they were appologetic and could see that the night staff had noted that security had been sent to that room twice. I understand it wasnt the fault of management that these rude people chose to ruin our last nights sleep but I did think that the security staff member was very ineffective. I felt these people should have been told to shut up or pack their bags and go. It doesnt seem fair that we paid good money and certainly did not get a good nights sleep!

My first few experiences were very nice and there was great potential for this to be a great part of my trip. My room was very clean and had a nice view of Robson Street (a major shopping and restaurant area of the city) from both the view from two walls of windows and a balcony. The pool was a short lap pool (for two people at most), but there was a sauna and jacuzzi -- nice perks, even if the pool was a bit smallish. I was checked in by a friendly clerk who told me I could ask the front desk at any time for any concierge-type questions, they would be happy to help me out. I wish I could have found this same clerk later on as my experiences soured from that point on. I had done a lot of my own research before visiting Vancouver, so the few questions I had were brief and to-the-point -- they could have been answered quickly. However, only two of the five days I stayed at the hotel could I get someone to help me. The first was from the clerk on the first day (as I previously mentioned) and the second was from a porter after a desk clerk decided it was more important to assist the tour group couple in line behind me. Luckily the porter saw my dropped-jaw reaction and offered to help me before I stormed off -- this wasn't the first time I had been ignored, but I was still shocked by such behaviour and I was tired of being treated in that manner. Other than those two helpful hotel employees, the staff was very rude to me by either ignoring me outright or talking to me in a dismissive manner -- they were very short with their answer (I imagine in hopes I would just go away), negative, and not at all helpful nor even made any attempt to help me out/point me in the right direction so I could get an answer to my question. I didn't expect them to have all the answers, but I did expect a friendly attitude and to at least be pointed in the right direction. Let me provide an example. While I didn't think the noise from outside the hotel could be heard at night, the noise from both the hallway and the adjacent rooms could be (significantly) -- I had to use earplugs to help me get to sleep. However, one night I awoke to a fire alarm and a lot of commotion in the hallway. As I got up and ready to evacuate the building, the alarm turned off. I wasn't sure if it was a false alarm or not, but I could still hear lots of people in the hallway trying to get down the steps. I went out onto the balcony and saw two fire trucks. The second truck was leaving. Another person was out on her balcony and asked me if it was a false alarm or if we should evacuate. I said I didn't know. I called down to the front desk to find out what should be done. No one answered. So, I started down the steps to evacuate -- I figured better safe than sorry. I made it most of the way down when a couple coming up the steps told me it was a false alarm and that there were throngs of people waiting for the elevator to get back up, so they had decided to take the stairs. I walked up several flights of stairs with them and they commented that they were not with a tour group and having a bad experience at the hotel as well and wanted to know what my experience was like. I told them it was souring. Once I got back to my room, I tried for another hour to contact the front desk (I couldn't get back to sleep with all the noise) and still no one would answer the phone. I had been able to put together that it was most likely a false alarm, but I was still a little shook up after having been awoken in that manner and wanted some confirmation. I tried the next morning to ask the front desk what had happened, but again, like what had happened to me so many times before, once it was my turn to be waited on in the queue, the front desk person decided the tour group people behind me were more important and completely ignored me (as if I wasn't even standing in the queue). If the couple I talked to in the stair way hadn't mentioned they had had the same experience, I might have been a bit paranoid and thought I was in an episode of the twilight zone or something! I found the way I was ignored to be that bizarre. My best suggestion to the hotel management would be to get a dedicated concierge. Maybe that will help alleviate some of the burden on the other desk staff and they could better do what they seem to want to really do -- check in and cater to tour groups.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires, Argentina", "Title": "\u201cNO WI-FI.

This is actually our second visit to this hotel. We visited last summer with our son and were upgraded from a 2 queen bed room to a family suite which was awesome. This time we had a regular room with a king bed. This is a very nice, centrally located hotel. It is right on Robson Street downtown Vancouver. It is very reasonably priced for the area that it is in. We are from British Columbia, so we had our car, but you can walk to many great shopping areas and Stanley Park very easily. We also noticed there are free shuttle buses that stop in front of the hotel that will take you to various attractions. Capilano Suspension Bridge, and Grouse Mountain were two that we saw. If you do have a vehicle, parking is both underground or above ground right on site for 15$ per day. It seems to be a safe area, and there is a security guard in the parking area during the day... not sure about the night. There was no valet service and you can come and go as you please. I would recommend requesting an upper floor as this is a downtown area and is very busy and bustling. We were on the 28th floor and it was fairly quiet, but you do still hear traffic noise. The hotel itself was very quiet. It is not a fancy upscale hotel, but it is kept spotlessly clean. There was no wireless internet in our room, we had to plug into an ethernet connection. The internet was a bit sketchy, had a few problems getting online a couple of times, but it did work. The only other complaint I had was the fitness room is small. One treadmill, one elliptical and one exercise bike. The machines are in the same room as the lap pool, so it is VERY hot while exercising. This is a very nice place to stay if you want to be in the heart of the action, and don't expect fancy decor. One other tip I can offer is you may wish to bring your own shampoo and conditioner . There is a body gel/ shampoo dispenser in the shower but no separate bottles of shampoo. There are bottles of body lotion, hairdryer, and bathrobes in the room. Also a coffee maker.

The only sour note we had was with the check in itself - the front desk manager demurred and repeatedly queried the scanned and reprinted (to 2-a-page format, since we had several rooms) hotel booking emails we presented, even suggesting outright that we might have typed the quoted pricing in them ourselves. The suggestion however was rather absurd as by then the hotel's system itself was showing lower prices for our rooms than we had in our printouts from months before. We didn't appreciate the condescending treatment and the attendant delays by this one manager, but thankfully all the other staff (including another abashed front desk staff at the time) we'd encountered were friendly and pleasant.

My only complaint is the decor; it seems like the hotel was decorated in about 1992 and has not been redone - blue wallpaper, pink bathtub, old flyers in the elevator, etc. However, if that is indeed the case, the decor is definitely not as bad as it could have been, and for me this was a minor consideration.

I booked it through Hotels.com and paid for a superior room which meant I was on the 21st floor and the view from the balcony was amazing. As a single traveller I had loads of space. The safe in the wardrobe was great peace of mind to keep my laptop, passport and valueables. Free cabled internet connection was great and was quite speedy too. I had read on Trip Advisor that peole had complained about noise from the street below but that worry was put the rest once I got there. Yes, there was a bit of noise from the street below but only when the balcony door was open, and besides the hotel is located in the heart of downtown on Robson Street so how people can't expect to have some street noise is just not thinking sensibly. The location was perfect for exploring the city. The SkyTrain station (to get the train to and from the airport) was only 5 blocks away which is walkable but I had loads of luggage so got a cab and it was only $8! I would recommend renting a bike to explore Stanley Park - there is a rental shop just a few blocks away from the hotel too. Cycling round the entire sea wall was an amazing way to spend 5 hours. There is also a free shuttle bus from the hotel to Capilano Suspension Bridge which I would recommend as another trip out. I ate at the hotel restaurant only once and the food was very good quality and reasonable priced. Plenty of places to eat surrounding the hotel and a convenience store (London Drugs) the next block over if you want some snacks/drinks/fruit etc for your room. I made use of the coffee filter machine in the room each morning which was nice.

The location is excellent. Our room was very large, and had big windows, nice views, and a tiny balcony. The beds were very comfortable, and we slept well. The room was well cleaned every day. This hotel was clearly built in the 60's. It has been mostly but not completely updated, in a style consistent with the original construction. The air conditioner was a bit loud and had a funky old (but perfectly functional) pneumatic thermostat. A stretch of heating baseboard was out of position, revealing a few pipes behind. The fan in the bathroom was also a bit loud. We had some problems getting the sink drain stopper to stay in place, but it was promptly fixed when we mentioned the issue. There was always plenty of hot water, at a consistent temperature, regardless of time of day. So overall I would say maintenance was fine with a few quibbles. We were staying for 10 nights and they gave us a room on the 24th floor, which I suspect reduces street noise considerably. The lower floors might be noisier. There are only 8 rooms per floor, which keeps corridor noise to a minimum. The elevators were very slow around 9:30 AM when people tend to check out; otherwise they were good. The pool is small but OK, and there is a jacuzzi (not the hottest, but fine). Internet is free, but is not wireless -- they provide a short ethernet cable and that is it.

They use a power-line based system, which is a bit slow, but frankly faster than I have experienced in some higher-priced hotels. Towards the start of our stay, there were a few hour-plus internet outages. Later on, outages seemed limited to a few seconds. Self-parking is available for a reasonable price. We tried the restaurant only once (for breakfast), and it was good. The exercise area is very small. The \"business center\" is a single PC and printer in the lobby for which they charge $3 for 10 or 15 minutes.

We paid a premium for a room above the 15th floor expecting a great view of Vancouver, but all we could see was the nearby, surrounding taller hotels. Save your money if you're expecting a view and go for a lower floor at a cheaper price The shower here was superb - we'd just completed a long motorcycle tour of BC and Alberta and had stayed in quite a few hotels and guest houses, but this was by far the best shower. No breakfast included in the room price here but they do have a restaurant on the ground floor that serves a very good, reasonably priced breakfast on the ground. The location of the Blue Horizon is perfect for exploring \"downtown\" Vancouver. It's on Robson St, one of the main shopping thoroughfares so there are plenty of places to eat / drink here. It's also handy for walking to Coal Harbour and lots of other Vancouver attractions. We stayed here for four nights, and I'd booked the hotel because it stated that the price quoted included taxes - something to be aware of in BC as the HST tax can raise the price of goods / services dramatically. When we came to pay the bill on leaving, the invoice showed an additional HST tax. I commented to the (quite rude) reception clerk that the price included taxes. He then pointed me towards the small print which said that \"additional taxes\" could be charged. Aparently the taxes that were included are \"Hotel Taxes\", we still had to pay the HST which added a fair amount to the bill - far more than we''d budgeted for. For that reason alone I wouldn't ever stay at the Blue Horizon again, they should make it crystal clear just what taxes are and are not included in the price.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaufort, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cConfirming the Other Good Reviews\u201d", "Author": "caromex13", "ReviewID": "UR75482516", "Content": "Many others have detailed the reasons for their positive responses, and I'd like to second them.

The room that we had on the 25th floor faced east onto a side street and we later realized we wish we had requested a room facing west. This would have helped us see the fireworks on English Bay. The balcony was awesome (except for my husband who is afraid of heights). The room was not only bright and beautiful from the walls of windows and doors but also it was clean, comfortable and spacious. We were extremely pleased. We also went to the patio restaurant out front after a long day of sightseeing including a 6- mile bike trek in Stanley Park, a 4- mile walk to the water taxi, browsing through Granville Island (loved that), Gastown and Chinatown! We were exhausted and happy to be back at the Blue Horizon.

If you want to be in the middle of a Western shopping area, then it is well located. If you want a bit more character, head to Yaletown or other neighborhoods. Now, for the cons: The website advertises a fitness center, which is one of the reasons I chose this hotel. This is a gross overstatement. There are two, old treadmills and an old bike in the corner of the swimming area, where it is humid and stinks of chlorine. It was absolutely not conducive to working out, and four different front desk employees all admitted they would never claim their hotel has a fitness center. BUT, nobody offered me any compensation for this misleading advertising, and the hotel manager even defended this ridiculous excuse of a \"fitness center\". Noise: This is not the hotel's fault, necessarily, but the hotel was very noisy. I was on the 30th floor and was still constantly woken up by sirens. I live in DC, but I have NEVER heard police sirens that loud! The walls are also paper thin, so be prepared to hear every word your neighbor says. One more thing that I think is misleading: these are not all \"corner rooms\". Yes, the rooms jut out a few feet so you have a view from two sides. But \"all corner rooms\" implies only four rooms per floor. I was right in the middle of the hall, not in the corner at all. In a nutshell: this hotel is fine if you are not a light sleeper and are looking for a centrally located place with no frills.

What a fortunate turn of events. The Blue Horizon is a 31 story hotel, featuring very large suites with balconies. Each has a commanding view of one major segment of the city, especially from the upper floors. The spectacular views from our room were over Robson street and English Bay, stretching amazingly over parts of West Vancouver as well. We were once residents of Vancouver but have never experienced such a dramatic view. You are within 10 minutes walk of all the major downtown attractions, including great shopping and restaurants. There is a pool, hot tub and restaurant on the premises. For coffee addicts, Starbucks is 50 feet away. The downside of choosing the Westerly suite orientation is the noise. Vancouver is a big city and Robson street is likely the busiest place in it. Despite our 30 story elevation, we followed police and ambulance sirens, among other entertaining noises, into the wee hours. Once we figured out that turning the air conditioning unit on and shutting the balcony doors and drapes helped considerably, we had a reasonable night. The room is exceedingly large for a hotel, suggesting it had been built for apartment/condo dwellers. Well and comfortably furnished with a modern if small bathroom. No hand grips on the tub area but the hotel has some rooms with these features on request. The hotel does supply shampoo, despite statements from other reviewers, but it is in a dispenser in the tub area so might be missed. The queen bed was comfortable but missing a night table on one side. This was easily rectified by moving a table initially placed between two comfy chairs in the room. The staff was friendly and helpful. Parking was convenient and reasonable for Vancouver - perhaps one of the most unfriendly places ever for autos. It's impossible to beat the combination of features this hotel offers, and it's THE bargain in Vancouver.

He issued me a room on the 17th floor, The room was clean, Had a blue feature wall, bed was comfortable and i had a beautiful view of the mountains and ocean, The balcony was dirty and littered with cigarette butts, I immediately went back down to report the balcony as they clearly state there are fines for smoking on balconies and i didnt want a charge going onto my bill for something someone else had done, Also gave me an indication on how well they clean things. The bathroom was average, Had a wall dispenser with shampoo/shower gel, and a little body lotion. Finally got onto family who wired me money, and my bank who by then had explained the situation so i knew what was going on, Once the money had been transferred i went down and immediately paid the other 2 nights, Didnt really use the facilities for the rest of my stay, They had a small gym and pool, When i was checking out the girl asked me if i could wait whilst they checked my room, never had to do that in any other hotel including 5 star that i have stayed in, Vancouver is a fantastic city with very friendly people, Unfortunately the staff are clearly not from vancouver!

However, motorcycles apparently with no mufflers were racing up and down Robson St. all night. Our room had single pane windows and no blackout drapes, so I did not sleep very much at least the first night. When I filled out a comment card at checkout, I suggested double pane windows and blackout drapes to deaden some of this excessive noise.

The staff is awesome and were extremely responsive for requests like extra towels and pillows. I think they brought those things to our door within two minutes after we called! Talk about service! Our king size bed was very comfortable and a main reason why we slept in a couple mornings and they did include a mini-fridge in our room which was really needed. I also really liked the balconies that were outside every room. Really nice touch. The hotel does lack a few areas and one of those is a free breakfast. Hello guys, this is 2009; even the cheapy interstate hotels offer a free breakfast. They also charge $.50 for local calls! What's up with that? Also there are no microwaves in the rooms. This would have really helped us out as we had a few items with us that required a microwave for us to enjoy those things. Also the TV, while having an extensive selection of channels, has no local channels and if you want local TV, you have to watch Seattle stations! I know there are TV stations in Vancouver, but you could not watch any of them at this hotel. Parking is also an expensive $14/day plus taxes, but at least you get a covered garage onsite.

The hotel is also an easy 10 minute walk to Canada Place and Coal Harbour, and perhaps a 20 minutes walk to the English Bay Beaches.

I also believe that the hotel does not have a fitness center, but that it has an arrangement with a local health club. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel, but we did not eat there. (There is a great crepes restaurant - Le Bretanne - about a block away.) One of the local hop on- hop off tour busses stops in front of the hotel.

The front desk recommended a very good Chinese restaurant very near the hotel. It is called Hon's. Don't be put off by the large open room and lack of ambiance. The food is good and it seems always to be crowded. My only complaint is the many taxes imposed at checkout. They add a government tax, an accomodation tax and they even charge tax on the parking.

Bar soap for sink only. Body lotion. Free internet access, safe and refrigerator. Free coffee, tea and hot water maker. Rooms were extremely spacious.

Ask for a room facing Stanley Park. Contact hotel directly for best rate and room location. Access to ice is limited to just a few floors. the 14th floor is highest before paying for an upgrade to superior room. But ask for an upgrade. We didn't have to ask, they just gave it to us but if they don't, ask. Parking is convenient, and bringing your luggage in and out is no problem. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The morning we left for the airport, we ate breakfast in the hotel cafe. We told the waiter we were trying to make a plane and we couldn't believe how fast our food arrived. It was inexpensive and good value. All in all, we would definitely recommend this hotel. Note: if you are interested in using the trolley to get around to the sites in the city, it stops in front of the hotel. You can print a $1 off coupon from the internet and print the schedule.

We used the indoor pool as it opened early one morning and enjoyed the experience. But it must be the smallest pool for a hotel of this size ever! A family of 4 would fill it! We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, prefering instead 'La Bretagne Creperie' which serves the most delicious filled crepes at a good price.

It seems to be reasonably priced for the area. The location is perfect, right on Robson Street, which is the main drag for restaurants and shops downtown.

There is a restaurant/bar in the lobby which was convenient, we ate breakfast there and it was pretty good. The hotel has a parking garage attached, which was nice since we had a car. It is $14 a day, so not cheap, but parking is at a premium downtown so relatively speaking it is not a bad value. The staff was very helpful and friendly, though my husband and I are pretty \"low maintenance\" and didn't ask for much other than for directions a couple of times. The absolute best thing about our stay was the balcony off our room. The view was GORGEOUS! We were out there every night of our stay with cocktails to watch the sunset. There is a liquor store a few blocks away, so we bought some beer and were able to keep it cold in the room since the minibar had plenty of room. Other reviewers have mentioned that they had a problem with street noise; our room was on the 19th floor and we had no problem, couldn't hear a thing! Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Our friends had 2908 which was on the opposite side, and while lovely, could not match the dramatic harbor view that we had. I think the hotel tries to make up for the lack of a view, though, in those \"lesser view\" rooms as it was somewhat larger than mine, with more floor space and two chairs, compared to our one. The rooms are somewhat dated, you can really see how they've updated somethings (new bathroom vanity) but not others (bathtub was shallow and pale pink, with a damaged finish). This aside, the \"'datedness\" was not so dramatic that I had that icky wonder-how-many-thousands-have-been-here-before-me feeling, if you know what I mean. Good stuff about the hotel was the room, the view, and the location. It was very quiet, and for a busy weekend I had no complaints at all about noise. Negatives, which are more inconvenient than anything else: tiny elevators -- more than once on the way down we were too full to take any more passengers; the very small lobby means check-out is a zoo, and lastly, I'm not sure how the hotel handles room assignments but it seemed a bit odd to me -- when they made the reservation my friend got the impression they were assigning us specific rooms right then, and she was told we would not be on the same floor (you can't reserve through the hotels website and have to call directly). Then they arrived before us, and were told their room wasn't ready, so when we arrived about 20 mins later and were immediately checked in (same room type, same floor) I found that a little odd, and potentially frustrating for guests traveling together.

We went there one evening, were shown a table but ended up being ignored and never got to order etc. After being reminded the waitress promised she would be with us in a few minutes but failed to turn up so needless to say we left!! But that was the only bad experience we had in The Blue Horizon. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody. It is very reasonable and in a great location. The staff are so professional and made are stay very relaxed.

It was easy to walk to most destinations, and the ethnic restaurants in the area were outstanding -- everything from French crepes to Japanese sushi to Chinese noodles to Indian curry.

You could select synthetic or down pillows, too! The room was fairly large, with a chair, desk, full closet, and in-room safe.

I've stayed there more than ten times since first discovering it in a AAA guide in 1997. My room at the Blue Horizon always feels more like my private Vancouver apartment rather than a hotel room. I'm always pleasantly welcomed by the staff, and the rooms have always been very nice. The Blue Horizon is located in an ideal spot in Vancouver, directly on Robson Street. The major sites of Vancouver are within easy walking distance: Stanley Park, Canada Place, Coal Harbor, Granville Island, the Seabus terminal, etc. The Blue Horizon is designed so that all rooms are corner rooms. Depending on your room, you might look across Burrard Inlet to the North Shore mountains, down Robson Street all the way to Mt. Baker in Washington, toward Stanley Park, or to the northwest overlooking English Bay with Vancouver Island in the distance. All rooms are large and provide wonderful views regardless of the direction they face. Facilities at the hotel are well-maintained. Superb dining choices are found throughout downtown Vancouver, but it's always pleasant to enjoy a few meals downstairs in the Blue Horizon's restaurant, Inlets Bistro. Sidewalk dining is provided during the warmer months of the year. Transportation to and from the hotel is ideal. I usually take the YVR Airporter, which stops one block from the hotel. After spending a few days enjoying Vancouver on foot, I pick up a car rental from one of the nearby agencies. Afterward trips further afield, such as drives to Whistler or Vancouver Island, are possible, plus rental costs are far less with downtown agencies than at the airport. My most telling endorsement of the Blue Horizon: a booking agency once placed me in a downtown five-star hotel. After one day of disappointment, I cancelled the remaining days and booked the rest of my stay at the Blue Horizon.

My only negative with the hotel is that the balconies don't have furniture and the railings are not even half walls, but open slats about 10 inches wide. Made me nervous! Would definitely ask for a lower floor if staying with very young children. The sliding glass door that leads to the balcony would be easily opened by a child and the child could probably slip through the railing openings. Just a caution that if you have young children and stay here...you must be fully watchful!

On the morning of the 3rd day, I turned on the faucet in the bathtub to take a shower, and what appeared to be feces came out of the faucet. Ewwwwwww! We called the front desk and told them that we needed a plumber. They had 2 staff member up there within 5 mintues to find out what was going on. We showed them the problem and requested a new room, and they told us that someone would call us soon. Within another 5 minutes, a manager called and told us that they would be giving us a new room, and upgrading us to a superior king room at no extra charge. We told them that would be fine. We were seriously grossed out, but I guess plumbing problems happen, and they took care of it promptly. Overall, we were impressed with the service and would call it a good experience.

It is right on Robson Street, which is a good location if you like upscale clothing stores. We stayed on a Saturday and Sunday night and were able to receive a small AAA discount only on Sunday's stay. The room had lots of windows which allowed for a great view. We were overlooking English Bay and could see part of the mountains, although they were somewhat blocked by other high rise hotels and condos. It was a hot weekend and our air-conditioning did not work properly the first night, so they moved us to a room across the hall. It still had great city views, but I'd definitely request a room looking over the bay if you have a choice. Also, because Robson St. is busy and noisy on the weekend nights with party goers, request a room on the 15th floor or above to avoid noise. We didn't have any problem on the 21st floor. I was a little disappointed that our room didn't have a refrigerator, but the room was clean and the hotel staff was polite. Note that Robson is a long street, so plan on doing a lot of walking if you want to see it all. The hotel is towards the north end of the street. Granville (another main street) is a good walk from the hotel, as is Stanley Park, Gastown, etc. The city bus is a cheap alternative to walking. If we went back to Vancouver, I would choose to stay in another neighborhood to try something different. Also, I got a good tip from someone who used to be a resident of Vancouver. If you take a car and drive from place to place, make sure you park in a secure parking garage with an attendant or just leave your car in your hotel's parking garage. Do not park on the street or leave anything visible in your car, as theft is a big problem in the city.
