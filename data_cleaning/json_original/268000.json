{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Basic but cheap Well, the hotel is easy to find ! with a large sign for it giving directions as you approach Berga.It's very basic - as per the price - but when we stayed there (September 03) there was no hot water when we arrived. We complained, when we returned after eating it was hot, next morning it wasn't - so not overly happy, as hot water an essential. Was given free breakfast to compensate.If you have the budget for it (100 for two) go to the Sala restaurant up the road from the hotel, as the food there was absolutely superb.", "Date": "Sep 10, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR356444381", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "xtrapnel"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d268000-r1278194-Hotel_Estel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "268000", "Price": "$74"}}
