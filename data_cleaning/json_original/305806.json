Facing the main entrance of hotel, on the left hand side, walk towards the traffic lights, Across the street, there is a building where they sell all fashion clothings, shoes etc etc. It may cost a little bit more than those you buy in the Ladies Market but the quality is better and more designs. This building only open late in the afternoon till 10-11pm. On the top floor of this building, there is a restaurant which have one of the nicest DIM SIM. As you walk down, you can find the gold fish market where they sell lots of fishes and also pet's products. If you are an explorer, you can walk to Ladies market, Fa Yuen Market, Flower Market etc. This hotel is at one of the best location in Hongkong but it do need an upgrade. I stayed in a Deluxe room.

First time (2009) I was with my wife; this time it was the two of us plus our 2-year-old son. We immensely enjoyed our stay at Metropark Mongkok both times. The first thing that attracted us to Metropark was the location-- just across the street from Prince Edward MTR Station and in the heart of Mongkok. If you've been to HK before, you know how important it is to be in very close proximity to an MTR station. The hotel is located in a residential/commercial area of Mongkok, meaning most of the people you will see around are locals rather than tourists. Few restaurants have English-speaking staff and you will see none of the swanky/cosmopolitan feel of Hong Kong's central business district. Which suited our travel preferences perfectly since when we travel we want to feel the local colours. If you want to be pampered in 5-star luxury (with a tiki bar), I suggest you skip this hotel. The rooms are fairly clean and the bathrooms are decent. Don't expect modern furnishings or swanky fixtures. Don't expect a room with a view either (see picture). We never tried the hotel restaurants since some of our favourite restaurants in HK (i.e., those with almost no English-speaking staff) are a stroll away. Again, recall that this is a budget hotel-- USD 100/night including taxes is pretty cheap by HK standards, especially considering its proximity to the MTR station-- so manage your expectations. Now for the service. Many other reviews say service is terrible, but I beg to differ. Although there weren't much smiles or friendly banter to go around (as is commonly the case in HK, or Singapore for that matter), they were very accommodating. We arrived at 11 AM on a Saturday, and even if check-in was 2 PM they gave us a room. Ok, so we were lucky that rooms were available, but still they made an effort to check us in. Other requests-- e.g., for extra linen, or to heat leftover food-- were also promptly taken care of. The clincher for us was when my 2-year-old son's finger got swollen due to an injury (not in the hotel, to be clear). We asked the hotel staff to help us locate a doctor-- on a Sunday afternoon. As soon as I relayed our request, first-aid staff went to our room to check on my son's finger and one of them said they will immediately look for an open clinic.They found a clinic and not only did they give us directions to the clinic, but staff even accompanied us to the clinic and made sure we knew our way back. The following day, the staff asked how my son's finger was doing every time they saw us in the lobby. Smiles were still a rarity, but the concern was there. On this trip, the staff went beyond our expectations to help us out. In 2009 it was the location that brought us to the hotel, but it is the service this time around that will ensure we will come back.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAverage, clean but outdated and rather expensive\u201d", "Author": "T1ramisu", "ReviewID": "UR131239181", "Content": "Stayed here 2 nights.

It was last February 2012 and it's still a peak season so the daily rate of Php 4,500+ is much like accepted. Though the building is a bit old, I can still say that we were satisfied with their service, food and experience. The Prince Edward MTR station is just less than 5 minute walk and Mongkok Ladies Market is very accessible by foot. And because of its central location, the area is crowded. Unfortunately, after three times in Hongkong, it's only then we have experienced that someone is after us. It was our first night and we got to the hotel late (I think, 1 AM) from our tour to Avenue of the Stars and Ladies Market. We walked from Ladies Market going to the hotel and when we're almost in the side entrance, I noticed that a man in black jacket with a cap (a typical goon-looking guy) is following us. I have this instinct that he's after us. After few more walks, I saw him exchanging hand languages with another man who is about to approach us. My heart beat so fast and the next thing I knew is we were running going to the hotel lobby and we stopped at the reception. To our surprised, they also got in but after looking around, they went out to the side exit/entrance. The elevator of the hotel does not require a keycard and the people are coming from everywhere. They just look so suspicious. Thank God nothing happened but it took a while before the shivering of my legs are gone. I think the hotel needs more security, at least some lighting around the vicinity during the night or someone checking if the people are really guests of the hotel.

Obviously they're different cities and space is a premium in HK, but it wasn't the size of the room, it was more the tired standard of the fixtures and fittings. The view however was completely aamzing and this was the real treat of the room. I agree with everyone suggesting to pay the extra for the harbour view room.

Our booking was for a standard double non-smoking room (no breakfast) and cost \u00a3890 via exped\u00eda. We were extremely happy with the location of the hotel. It was very easy to get to (the A21 bus from the airport took about 45 minutes, cost HK$33 and dropped us off right in front of the hotel (stop 5 if you refer to the electronic signboard inside the bus) though not so easy for the return journey. We found the best option for us was a taxi to Kowloon station (approx HK$40) and then the airport express train from Kowloon to the airport (HK$140 for 2). The hotel has a shuttlebus but this was more expensive and took longer. The hotel is situated just across the street from Prince Edward MTR station and almost at the end of Nathan Road. Ladies Market and Fa Yuen Street are within walking distance. Spaghetti House and a number of fast food restaurants including a branch of the Caf\u00e9 de Coral (where you could get a tasty meal with drink for under HK$40) were all close by. A 7-11 was just across the street and bars such as Delaneys (HK$100 for 2 pints of cider) and Bahama Mamas (Knutsford Terrace) offering drinks for less than HK$40 were not difficult to get to. We found a cheap internet caf\u00e9 close by but there were also a limited number of free computer terminals for short-term access available at Central metro station. We made use of these as we used the station on a number of occasions. Hotel check-in was fast and painless and we were issued with 2 card-keys for a room on the 8th floor. The room was quiet, a good size with good lighting and mirrors. The bed was comfortable and the air-con worked well. There was sufficient hanging and drawer space for our needs. There was an electronic safe, complimentary slippers, hairdryer, writing desk (stationery provided) and a reasonable sized mini-bar/fridge. A kettle (with 3in1 coffee and teas (no sugar or milk)) was provided. The TV had a few English-speaking channels but not BBC world or CNN. 2 complimentary bottles of water and a newspaper were provided daily. The bathroom was clean, modern with a (full-sized) bath/shower combination (good pressure), toilet (good flush) and washbasin (with large well-lit mirror.) Bath sundries (shower gel, shampoo, soap, toothbrushes, comb, shaving set, sewing kit, shoeshine shower-hat, and tissues) were replenished daily. Bathtowels, handtowels and facecloths (all good quality and like new) were replaced daily. There was an extendable washing line over the bath which we found very useful. A typhoon limited our movements for one day of our stay so we had the buffet dinner in the hotel (HK$228 less a room discount but plus tax) and drinks in the bar (2 beers for HK$45 during happy hour). The hotel security guard made visible patrols and staff were generally helpful (offering an umbrella loan as required!). There was a luggage storage area (together with weighing scales) by the lobby and a small bakery on the ground floor provided a selection of breads and pastries. Overall, we were very impressed with the Metropark Hotel Mongkok and thought it good value for money. We would certainly have no hesitation in recommending it or staying there again.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakland, California", "Title": "\u201cVery good value in convenient location\u201d", "Author": "benz37", "ReviewID": "UR120683156", "Content": "I've stayed at many hotels in Hong Kong, both on the HK side, and on the Kowloon side.

Toilet looks very old pattern but still consider clean. Check Out by 12pm, no grace period even though website stated late check out at 3pm which is more like gimmick.

Checked in quickly & efficient bellboy quickly got our luggage to our requested & pre-assigned non-smoking room on 4/F, wasn't too noisey facing back of other buildings on side street (but no view at all, it's travel agency prepaid & no upgrade option offered) We had 3 rooms among 8 adults of same size, too small for 3 adults to share with very limited space for luggage, tiny round coffee table moved inside bathroom under the sink to make room. All of the rooms had a dampness feel to it, likely the result of HK's high year-round humidity and hot days (temps between 80 and 95 degree in mid-Sept.) Air condtioner & mini-refrigerator will only stay on when guest key card remained inserted so we go out only to return to a very warm room & nothing cold in the frigerator. With 4 guest elevators, it's still slow but okay, ate breakfast buffet once in the cafe - not included @ $10 USD each with 10% service already, decent choice & variety but could be better - too warm for us to go out. Vent ducts will carry the kitchen's cooking odor into all 3 of our rooms (and all other hotel guests' for that matter) each morning as they prepare & cook breakfast, smells of garlic & other flavors would travel into the rooms - not sure if it's a filtering or reverse flowback issue, it's not something that we usually deal with in the US. Housekeeping does a good job of detailed cleaning our rooms daily & changing ALL the sheets, towels & replacing needed items - including free toothbrushes, soap & shampoo. Just bring your own hand lotion & leave other 3-1-1 items behind to leave room in your luggage to pickup inexpensive souvenirs in town. Bathroom is basic, functional but water pressure & flow of showerhead could be better (no pulsing/turbojet) - tap water isn't recommended for drinking (not even after broiling) and no free bottled water, we brought our own at cheapter price across the street at 7-11's (also at supermarket below McDonalds - great breakfast) using our Octopus Card (without scrambling for loose change or coins) Hotel catered to mostly mainland Chinese visitors short staying in town with bus \"terminal\" depot around the corner, often filling the small but busy lobby. Security does patrol & check the floors & room at all hours, good & reassuring since hotel has multiple entrances/exits. Small Chinese bakery sell good variety of fresh bread & westernized pastries and coffee from 7 am to 7 pm in lobby, next to small luggage store. We used the hotel's 24/7 accessible mini-safe deposit next to the reception/front desk to keep our passports & things, it's better than leaving them inside our locked room's luggage since mini-safe isn't available in the room. Internet access isn't free & over-priced for its posted rates/charges, I purchased a China Mobile prepaid Sim across Nathan Road inside the mall for $120 HKD ($15 USD) for very cheap local calls plus unlimited internet access for about $1 USD daily that tethered my laptop, problem solved & the CM people even helped configure my US-branded HTC smartphone for online access - highly recommended. Old style boxed TV in our standard/superior room was slow with the remote, but at least had CNN/BBC & stock info channels, but it made the small room tiny. Cabinets & closets hasn't been freshened or upgraded in probably 20 years and hallways/carpeting are on the darker side (to better hide wear & tear with less cleaning). There aren't any decent restaurants to eat within the immediate vicinity that I would recommend for the average non-Chinese visitors staying here, need to walk across Nathan Road into the larger shopping mall for great Dim Sum at discounted prices before 11 am or evening meals, or further up Nathan Road toward Mongkok MTR station (Lady's Market) for more variety. For a quick sightseeing ride on upper deck of air-conditoned bus, take the A21 toward Hung Hom and you will ride along Nathan Road toward TST, exit & walk the Golden Miles as the MTR or subway below ground is quicker but no sights/sounds/smell for you to see. Location-wise, it's fairly good with MTR Prince Edward Station just 1 block away, and you will find bakery, gift shops & micro electronic stores, ATM & 7-11's below in the concourse level as you come & go. Across the street on Lai Chi Kok Road, there's a Foreign Currency place where you can easily exchange between USD, RMB and HKD with no service fees or charges, very good rates & no passports needed. Next door to them, an inexpensive laundry by the pounds, same day 2 hour service if dropped off before 6 pm - we did 5 days' worth of dirty clothes for under $10 USD, neatly folded & smelling fresh at a tiny fraction of what hotel laundry will charge by the pieces - ready for our onward journey. Departing for the airport is a challenge since the closest A21 bus stop for the trip back to HKIA is several blocks away and dragging 2 loaded suitcases plus carryon 2 blocks & down the stairs to MTR, plus transfering to the airport line aren't fun. We opted to get bellboy's help to move our luggage & pre-booked a taxi, ride was quick & with tolls and tips, etc. took 45 minutes for $300 HKD total or about $12 USD each x 3 people in the taxi. I've stayed at smaller size hotel rooms in HK before but they are newer & better value for the US dollars spend. This is aging hotel in need of a major upgrade to stay competitive with demanding oversea travelers. It's supposed to be a 3 star property but I would rate it no higher than 2.5 star for its existing & overall conditons and price-to-value vs. other nearby hotels in Kowloon. On our next non-tour based trip to HK, we would look for a different place for our weeklong stay & pass on MPHM.

Check-in have been generally hassle-free, and the rooms are reasonably large in size compared to many other hotels in Hong Kong, which is rather infamous for its small hotel rooms.

Well, it all depends on what you're wanting. Getting there is sooo easy. I found it first time. Just get off the airport and get on the A21 bus for about 45 minutes... The bus stops, bang outside the Metropark, Mongkok! It's not the most luxurious hotel. Saying that, the staff are polite and the hotel is clean. I'm not a smoker and I originally requested for a non smoking room and a double bed. They only have the 11th floor as a non smoking floor. This I didn't mind (as I wanted to be as high as possble to avoid any noise from the traffic outside) but all the rooms on the 11th floor have twin beds only! I found the room rather cramped, small and tight... For example, I had no choice (of space) but to put my suitcase laid flat on the spare twin bed. The desk next to the bed was small and smaller still was the space around the chair behind the desk. I found it exceptionally annoying that the waste bin was sooo small! Everytime I tried throwing something in the bin, I kept missing as the wastebin wasn't wide enough! There is air conditioning but you can't set it at the room temperature that you really want! More often than not, I found myself more cold that just right! The choice of TV channels were rather limited. If your cantonese is poor then you a total choice of 2 english channels. One was OK but the other one was mainly business orientated talking stocks and shares. Hmmm... What other things can I think of? Oh yeah, there no personal safe, the lighting was very poor in the room (I found the lighting to be more creamy dark coloured than pure white) and the view I had through the window, well, it was one massive messy block of flats! The bathroom was small and had no shavers mirror, for checking out those spots and so on... ;-p Shower was not pressure powered - It is certainly a lot weaker than I would have liked! I didn't seem to find an ethernet connection, as I wanted to try my new portable wireless access point with my iPod Touch... Which brings another point up, there is no free wi-fi connection there! Oh, even worse. There is only one wall plug socket available! This was bad! I mean I had to charge my PSP, iPod, use the hair drier etc... Why only one wall socket spare??? All these negative things sound so bad... The REAL plus point about Metropark, Mongkok is location!!! :-) It's in the middle of Sham Shui Po and Mong Kok both which are about 10 minutes walk away and is only one stop away from Prince Edward MTR. Prince Edward MTR is literally just across the road from the side entrance of the hotel. Mong Kok is great for shopping and Sham Shui Po is good for games and computer stuff. All in all, you get what you pay for. I found myself shopping so much that it's really convenient for me to just to do my shopping then come back to the hotel and drop my bags off, relax an hour and start again. If push come to shove and my budget is tight, I would stay at Metropark, Mongkok again. For what I paid, \u00a3520 for 11 nights accomodation, I think it's one of the better value hotels in Hong Kong.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "eJovi", "ReviewID": "UR14155983", "Content": "Stayed there for 5 nights.

The views are typically of nearby apartments and the shopping precinct. But very very good value for money in comparison to what you would be paying in other areas of Hong Kong.

The location: wasn't the typical tourist area in comparison to the other side of Nathan Road in Kowloon or places on Hong Kong island, however, it was great area because it is where the locals shop and reside so is generally cheaper and is very close in proximity (in walking distance) to the markets (such as ladies market) and popular shopping areas.
