MY REAL COMPLAIN IS : The room do not look as nice as they seem on the picture and it really look like a low class hotel in the lobby.

Although modest, accommodations are fully adequate. I had single room with a queen size bed comfortable bed with box spring. The room is equipped with night tables to either side of the headboard, dual light switches at the door and the beside the head board for the overhead light and the headboard lights, a desk with a large mirror and a chair. A large closet shares the wall with the large bathroom. The windows are large and open with drapes colour coordinated with the carpeting and the bed covering. There is a frosted vented window in the bathroom. All fixtures functioned well. I did not have to wait long for the hot water and the pressure was good in both rooms. Both rooms ( and baths) were very clean. Housekeeping staff do a very good job. I would recommend one of the interior rooms facing the courtyard over those facing the street. There is no view but they are quieter and larger. In the former, the TV is mounted on a wall bracket which I kept bumping with my head. In the latter, the TV is mounted on a table. The bellman and desk staff are excellent. They are all friendly, efficient and helpful. Most speak very good English but were patient when I tried to practice my very limited Espanol. Taxi rates to most relevant destinations are posted at the reception desk and hotel staff will arrange for taxi service on request. Drivers often try to charge above the posted rates, but relent when challenged. The hotel has a very good restaurant. The service is good, prices very reasonable and the food is tasty with a wide menu selection. I noticed that many people that worked in the area or lived nearby were regulars at breakfast and lunch. There is good security, as all entrants to the hotel must pass the bellman and the front desk. The hotel is well-located being two blocks from the Christopher Columbus monument on the Paseo de la Reforma. Centro Historico is readily accessible on foot. Even with my sore and wonky knees, I did not require transportation. The neighborhood appears to be safe and several mercados with a wide range of merchandise are nearby. The Turibus - a tour bus service with two routes that uses red double-decker buses - can be caught at the Columbus circle. The stop is not marked nor obvious but it was easy to ask for directions from passersby in front of the Fiesta Americana. For first time visitors, in my view, the Turibus is a must. It provides you with an excellent overview of the major sights and neighborhoods. With the day pass, you can get on and off as you wish.

Had a very simple check-in process (I had booked through Travelocity). Almost everyone I encountered during my stay spoke some English, and they managed not to laugh at my Spanish - both of which were greatly appreciated. Some of the decor in the rooms is a bit outdated and worn (think Motel 6), but for about $35/night (through Travelocity) I can't complain about a thing like that. What was most important to me was that it was VERY clean. The restaurant has good, tasty food at very reasonable prices. Lunches I had were between 4-6USD, dinners were in the 6-8USD range - even room service never cost me more than 9USD (depending on what you order, of course). The maid only leaves one bottle of water per room per day, but I simply left a note asking for two bottles and 20MXN/day as a tip (for both the water and the cleaning). There were always two bottles waiting for me when I got back to the room. Everyone on the staff was VERY friendly and helpful at all times. I would be glad to stay there again anytime. Only slight complaint .... The wifi in my room was slightly dubious - never above 25% and often dropping out. Which is fine for checking e-mail, but can be annoying when trying to skype people back home. There is also a public internet access computer in the lobby (which I didn't use). You can book tours through the hotel, and on someone else's advice that it was cheaper that way, I booked two of my tours through the hotel. The hotel uses an agency (based in another hotel) called Monopolis. I found the tour guide to be a nice person, but seemingly bored by her job. On our tour of Puebla she even left us alone for 30 minutes of \"free time\" while she sat in the Zocalo and smoked. And then, rather than being dropped off AT my hotel I was dropped off a block away (in the dark) with erroneous directions (if I hadn't already been out enough to recognize some of the buildings nearby I might have gotten seriously lost). The reason for this abrupt drop-off was that the road was supposedly closed. It was NOT closed, it was jam-packed with traffic moving at a snails pace and they just couldn't be bothered since we were already late getting back. As a single female traveler I didn't really appreciate being dropped off in the dark by myself, and so I canceled my subsequent tour with that company.

Arrived at airport and took taxi to hotel. Cost about US $20. Hotel check-in was no problem. Hotel room was very, very basic, with two double beds with minimal toiletry amenities. Had to ask the maid for more bottled water, since room only had one small bottle. Rooms are not air-conditioned. Room door is paper thin and has very skimpy doorlock, had to keep a chair against doorknob at night. The room was very noisy due to evening hotel lounge entertainment ( I was on the 4th floor) and club next door. But who cares, I did not stay in room except to sleep, which was a bit tough due to nightclub noises and late night tourists arriving by bus at hotel. Location makes this place great. Only a few blocks from the main LA REFORMA boulevard, and also a stop for a (MUST DO) \"TURISMO\" red bus tour stop. If you have your own laptop, internet access code can be asked for at check-in desk, otherwise they had a PC setup sitting in the hotel lobby. I think they charge to use it, not sure. There is a very helpful and US speaking tour office guy right in the hotel lobby. He was from Boston, and was very helpful with any questions. I did not use the hotel restaurant for any meals, there is a small diner just down the end of the street. Make a right turn outside the lobby door, go across thestreet past the glitzy funeral parlor (with classic hearses parked in front) and go to end of street. Good food, cheap. There is also a \"WINGS\" (a Mexico version of a DENNY's) located a few blocks further on LA REFORMA. Ask anyone at the hotel how to get there. Good food, also fairly cheap. Only problems encountered at this hotel was on the first night. My wife and I went into the hotel lounge where there was live entertainment going in.. The sign on on the door said there was a 40 peso surcharge, so I asked the guy at the the front desk if this applied to hotel guests, and he said \"No.\" After we sat down and ordered some drinks the lounge manager came over and told us that there was an 80 peso service charge, so I argued that the sign said \"40\" and he said that \"was before 8PM.\" Not that big a deal, the cost of three beers, 2 good size wines for the wife and the 80 peso \"lounge charge\" came out to less than US$17. Can't even drink that cheap in New York City. But watch out for this \"bait and switch\" at this hotel. The maid service on our floor was not up to par. We had to ask them for extra bottles of water several days. Oh yes, if you need a hairdryer (which are not is the rooms), they ask you to leave a 100 peso deposit at the front desk. The location of the hotel is great. You are within very short walking distance to the famous Mercado Artesanal La Ciudadela (1 block south of Parque Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Mar\u00c3\u00ada Morelos, Col. Ju\u00c3\u00a1rez,). Open every day about 10-5, the bustling Mercado Artesanal La Ciudadela bursts with the widest range of wares and the best bargains in the capital. The public park just across the street hosts public dancing on the weekends, and also go there during the Sunday afternoon to see Mayan cultural dancers. Free, and worth the trip here to shop till you drop. There is also a great sandwich (Tortas) shop about 5-6 blocks ( 10 minutes walk) from the Mercado, and DEFINITELY worth the trip to eat cheap. Located in a neighboorhood featuring plumbing/lighting stores, find the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cafeteria El Cuadrilatero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a very small place located on Luis Moya # 73, Col. Centro Historico. MASSIVE Tortas (sandwiches), very small price! The place is owned by a Lucha Libre Wrestler, Super Astro, and is easy to spot mid-street by the many masked wrestlers painted on the sign. Go here, and don't be afraid to walk from the Mercado , the neigborhood is safe. For a review with a slideshow, see web site: http://jesuschairez.blogspot.com/2008/11/lucha-libre-tortas-yes.html (Use Google Maps to see exact location). The closet METRO station near the hotel (name \"BALDERAS\") is also located at the far corner of this Park, about 4 blocks (10 minutes walk) from the hotel, and is THE BEST WAY to get around ANYWHERE in Mexico City , CHEAP ($0.35) and SAFE. However, being from New York City, I know what to keep my eyes open for. First rule: don't act like a tourist. Act as if you know exactly where you are going. Rule #2: Don't travel during rush hours or after dark, and keep your wallet in front pocket , your eyes open and your antennas up. You can go anywhere in the city very easily, and SAVEa ton of cash in the process. IN fact, my wife and I were traveling with carry-on luggage, so we decided to use the METRO back to the airport, which was fast and efficient. Just make sure you go to the \"TERMINAL AEREA\" station on the Number 5 line, and NOT the \"AEROPUERTO\" station on the Number 1 line. The $20 saved on taxi fare went a long way to buy some cheap eats at the many food concessions at the airport before we departed. Get a great METRO MAP to print out at this link: http://nanotube.msu.edu/nt04/img-var/MEX-metromap.jpg All in all, the HOTEL PRIM is a basic \"Motel 6\" type hotel that offers few amenities, but location and price can't be beat.

Believe me you NEED it during this month. I gave into the comments that it gets chilly at night, so I thought I wouldn't need a/c during my stay. Well this is true if you stay in a room that gets a breeze through the window. Otherwise, you will be miserable with no cool air flowing. The hotel did not offer any fans either. I asked repeatedly. I didn't like the way the hotel was laid out. Think of a square. The rooms are lined along in a square shape and hollow in the middle, with the window facing the hollow area. Yes, there is only one window in the room and one in the restroom. Guests from across my hotel room and the floor rooms above could see through my window, which was also directly in front of my bed, so I had to keep my curtain closed. This didn't help with the whole cooling situation. My first impression of the room was...oh no. Many of the guest were young rude kids that stayed up every and all night yelling from outside their windows to other guests at either the same floor level or lower level rooms. During my first night, a Chinese foreigner was up yelling at them for about 30 minutes. I finally was fed up and called the front desk to ask them to stop shouting. They continued on for about another hour whistling, and making vulgar noises. My family came into town to spend some time with me, but I didn't want my them to stay at this hotel and experience what I had on the first night. I put them up at a different hotel that cost $35/night. I was paying $45/night. The second night, everything happened just as the first. I got up around 1a.m. and walked to my parent's hotel to get some sleep. The third and final night I was there, the some of the male guests kept eyeing and following me around. They made me feel unsafe. I waited four hours, before I went into my room because I didn't want them to see what room I was staying in. I couldn't sleep, worring if they had figured out what room I was in. They did knock on my door a few times and called my phone, but I didn't answer either. The hotel offers internet service, but it cost $10 to use. I recommend you take an iron for your clothes, alarm clock, plug adapter for your appliances, and extra toiletries, and fan. These aren't offered by the hotel. The front lobby of the hotel is misleading to what the actual rooms look like. It would have been nice to have marble floors. If you do choose to stay here, the cab ride is only $4.00 from the airport. The taxis at the airport will try to get $40 out of you if you don't purchase a ticket at the booth. The hotel itself offers this service, but it costs $14 each way. It is more economical to take the red and white taxis. That is what I rode in for all my rounds. To the Zona Rosa, I walked. It would have cost less than $1.50 in a taxi. For eating out on Saturdays and Sunday nights, I recommend \"Wings\". They have half price menus after 8:00 p.m. The arrachera steak is excellent and costs $6.98 dollars for a 10oz. I don't know why anyone would pay more than $10 per person to eat in Mexico City, even if it is a buffet. More than that you are getting ripped off. This was the only restaurant I ate at. The other times I ate from stands along the street. Birria (goat meat) stands at La Basilica are excellent and so are the Gorditas. I bought the meat by the kilo to make my own tacos with flour tortillas that are sold at a store down the block. This tortilla store also makes these great jalepeno tortillas and also ones made out of wheat. At La Basilica, I was able to see the Virgen Mary of Guadalupe, but I went at a bad time. I went during the pilgrimage of the entire state of Querretaro. There were thousands and thousands of people there. I went on a Sunday because I read online that the Basilica is closed on Mondays. This is not true. I also went to the Teotihuacan pyramids. There is a museum that closes at 5:30pm on Sundays. Take sunblock, shades, and a hat. You will need them. Xochimilco was awesome. Take a picnic basket and ice chest on the boat and have a party. Be careful of some of the shopping districts in Mexico City; they are not all safe.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Prim", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d154676-Reviews-Hotel_Prim-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$36 - $62*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Versalles 46</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
