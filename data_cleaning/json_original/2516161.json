When we got to the hotel a couple hours early, we had been driving all night, were exhausted, & badly in need of showers. The girls at the front desk were incredibly snooty & in no way accommodating. They told us there was no possible way we could check in then, but that if we came back around noon, there would probably be something available, since that was check out time. Turns out we were lied to about when we could check in. We came back at 12:45pm & there was absolutely NOTHING available still. Once again, the girls seemed put-out by us asking for our room. They told us we could wait at the bar for a little while & they would come & get us when a room was available, making it sound as though it would be very soon. We still needed to shower at this point. FINALLY, at 1:30pm, they let us go up to our room. When we got there, it was not the room we had reserved. It was a handicapped room. We figured that was not so bad, since it meant a bigger shower & balcony. However, looking inside the shower, the nozzle was ZIP-TIED to the bar, making it impossible to move up & down or remove at all. Also, the room was clearly not built level because without a lip on the shower, the water flowed out of the shower & spread all across the floor of the bathroom, making it slippery & treacherous. & they gave us no rubber mats or anything of the like for the bathroom floor. We looked in the mini-fridge & there was no mini bar at all. Not that we planned on using it, because they are always ridiculously expensive, but when we reserved the room, it said there would be one. & when my reservation tells me I will have something, I expect it to be there. When we got into bed that night, the sheets were scratchy & uncomfortable. the bottom of the COMFORTER was softer than the sheets, so we ended up stripping the sheet off & sleeping with just the comforter on the bed. The buffet in the morning was an absolute disaster. The room they used was way too small for the massive amount of people who attended. There was absolutely no organization in terms of lines or hotel staff present to indicate where to go or in what order. So people were shoving in front of us & being very rude. It made breakfast very unenjoyable for us. When we called the management to tell them all of this, they offered us no additional amenities or any apologies. They simply said, \"Thank you for informing us of the situation.\" We have never stayed at a hotel of this stature, coming so highly recommended, & had such horrible service in all of our travels.

We reserved and pre-paid for a high floor golf course/pool view room. This hotel has 6 floors. When we checked in at 3p, not only were there no high floor rooms in our room type available, there were no rooms ready at all in our room type. We we're told the 3rd floor was the best they can do or we can have a parking lot view higher up. No apology....just very matter of fact take it or leave it attitude. I reminded them of my pre-paid rate that I booked on their website and was told that this sometimes happens....again no attempt to apologize. If anything, he seemed bothered I was asking at all. We chose the 3rd floor room as we really wanted the golf course/pool view. We then were told that they were still cleaning our room and to take a seat in the lobby for about 20 min. We were also told we would be advised right away once the room was ready. Thirty minutes later, I went back to see the status of the room. He said that it's been ready for a while and gave me the key with no apology for having us just sit there. I then asked him when a higher floor room would be available. He said that tommorrow, some higher floor rooms would open up and to speak to the front desk in the morning. In the meantime our 3rd floor room balcony overlooked an overhang that goes out to the pool. The top of the overhang was littered with trash. The next morning, I went back to the front desk and spoke to a manager, who advised me that the guy the night before never should have told us there were higher floor rooms available the next day as this was not true. He said we'd have to wait until tomorrow. We were only there 4 nights, and 2 of them were in a room type we didn't want and hadn't pre-paid for. Again, the manager was very apathetic and acted like I was irritating him. Furthermor, there was no offer made to refund the rate difference or compensate us in any way. Half way through the trip, they did indeed find us a higher floor room (6th floor) and moved our stuff for us (after we had packed it all up). That was greatly appreciated and made all the difference in the world! The hotel itself is very nice! The suites were clean and comfortable with excellent housekeeping services. The breakfast was ample and pretty good....especially the made to order omlettes. The evening manager reception was great. It's basically an open bar from 5:30p - 7:30p. As other people have said, the snacks are nothing to write home about, but certainly fine. The pool and hot tub area was nice, but the pool itself is not well taken care of. There was a brown film around the inside edge of the pool from the waterline up. It's obviously not cleaned regularly and kind of gross. The views from this side of the property are wonderful. The golf course driving range is literally 50 feet from the pool deck. Beyond that are beautiful hills and mountains to enjoy all day long. The hotel is very close to the Paradise Valley Mall and there a lot of nearby restaurants. Would we stay here again? You bet we would, but we'd go in knowing not to expect much from the front desk folks and that we may or may not get the room we reserved. I see that a manager writes responses to these reviews. I certainly hope he/she is noticing the trend in most of these reviews......nice hotel....lousy front desk service.

It faced the clubhouse, but that wasn't a problem, although you can hear the loudspeaker and there was a wedding on Saturday evening. The strong positives for us: comfortable suite hotel in a good location for touring around Phoenix and Scottsdale with full made to order breakfast. And, the hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport. The room was fine; very clean and the bed was comfortable. The view of the golf course is lovely. We didn't have time to hang out on the property so I can't comment on the pool, etc. but the common areas were clean and comfortable.

He did not tell us when breakfast started or when the manager's reception started. He did not even bother to show us the general direction of either event. We did not know where the elevators were and had to hunt around to find them. We asked to be contacted if a dust free room came avaialble and were never called during our 4 day stay.

The sofa was frayed and sagging and needed to be replaced. As said in a previous review, the furniture in the lobby and throughout the hotel needs to be updated. The hotel was a very nice experience on Thursday and Sunday and the weekend was another story. Several large groups took over the hotel on Saturday. The pool area is very small and they had half of the area. They were wheeling in coolers and carrying in 12 packs of beer and being rather loud. Finally, management came out and told them they can't have their coolers and their own beer. I wish they would've come sooner because it was hard to enjoy a beautiful Saturday afternoon at the pool with all the chaos going on in such a small area. The area is nice around the hotel, not as nice as Scottsdale, but many different choices of restaurants nearby. We enjoyed walking the trails through the neighborhoods.

My buddy and I stay in room 4012, which is an end room. It was clean and kept in good condition. Very roomy, comfortable beds, nice size balcony overlooking the pool, golf course and mountains. The bathroom was directly off the bedroom and laid out in sort of a strange way. You entered from the bedroom into the toilet and tub/shower room (it was poorly lit as well) and then through another door to a room with a sink/vanity/mirror. Then exit through a door into the foyer by the hotel room door. Btw, the shower was very good. The \"kitchenette\" was to the left and then opened up into the living room area. Bedroom and living room both had TVs. As usual, the ES breakfast was fantastic, as was the Manager's Happy Hour!!!! The pool and whirlpool were clean and towels offered poolside. Didn't get a chance to play golf but other people we were with enjoyed the course. A few other couples rented a SUV and did a day trip to Flagstaff and Sedona. We did a day at Talkingstick casino but I wouldn't recommend going there unless you want to lose your money. Didn't look like anyone was winning in that place!

The hotel sits adjacent to a golf course in a nice area. However it\u2019s nowhere near the restaurants and major malls of Scottsdale. Here\u2019s the deal: Positives: \u2022 Large parking lot \u2013 with free parking for the hotel \u2022 Service was very good. Check-in was quick and easy and the clerk was friendly and helpful. Bartenders, cooks, and maids were pleasant and accommodating. \u2022 Great breakfast with excellent hot omelets and eggs, wide selection of breads and muffins, fruit, etc. Again above average for an Embassy Suites. \u2022 Evening reception was very good as well. Name brand beer, decent liquor and wine. A step up from the well junk booze served at some Embassy Suites. Snacks were somewhat limited with nachos and hot cheese each night and one hot item (quiche one night and skins another) which was ok but nothing special. \u2022 The golf course offered excellent discounts for hotel guests and the course was in excellent shape. Slight Negatives: \u2022 Rooms were clean and spacious but a little dated. The couch and the carpeting could use a refresh. It was worth it to upgrade to a golf course view. \u2022 They still charge for internet access which is ridiculous in this day and age. \u2022 The location was convenient to the highway (51) but not really Scottsdale as the name would imply.

We chose this hotel because the conference was located here and we did not want to rent a car and drive each day to the conference. However, if you choose to rent a car, parking is free. The hotel is located a 20 minute drive north of Sky Harbor Phoenix airport. Taxis run about $35 one way. You can also use the Desert Coach service, which is a $40 flat rate one way. Super Shuttle is another option for $19 one way, but it's a shared service and you might end up going to other hotels first before reaching your destination (your hotel or the airport), which might mean that transportation time will be longer than 20 minutes. The hotel recommends Desert Coach service because they are the most reliable, according to the hotel. The front desk will call Desert Coach to arrange transportation for you, but if you want to take a taxi or the Super Shuttle, the front desk will give you phone numbers for you to call. Two of the front desk members said that taxis might not arrive on time and be reliable, but I called the taxi myself the night before and the taxi was there, right on time. The hotel is located in Paradise Valley, and I do not know Phoenix well, but this area seems nice. Paradise Valley Parkway is a loop, and in the center is an indoor mall, as well as a Target and REI. It is easy to walk to Paradise Valley Mall, and it took us about 15 minutes to walk to some of the restaurants on the outskirts of the mall, which is great because we did not have a a car. The hotel lobby is clean and modern with a large lounge area. Check-in and check-out was efficient. I noticed 2 elevators, but since my room was on the second floor, I chose to take the stairs every day except for moving luggage. The stairs are located at the end of the hallways, and sometimes, they will lock you out. Someone had left a towel stuffed in the doorway to prevent that from happening. Our room overlooked the front entrance of the hotel. The hotel is located in a residential area that is quiet, so there are not clubs or bars or restaurants unless you walk towards the main road. The hotel has its own golf course that is shared with condominiums that also overlook the golf course. The view is fabulous from the lobby because you walk into the pool area and then you seen the golf course that is green with a beautiful backdrop of mountains. The pool is nice, not designed for lap swimming, but fun for families. The deepest section is 5 feet. There is also a hot tub. Towels are not provided. Every night from 5:30pm to 7:30pm, there is a manager's reception where they serve free drinks by the outdoor pool and snacks by the indoor lounge area. There are numerous flat screen TVs, so sports fans will be quite happy here. Embassy suites is known for their breakfasts, especially their made to order omelets, and they are great. There is also a hot food section with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and oatmeal. There is also fresh fruit and yogurt as well as pastries and English muffins and bagels. There is also milk, juice, tea, coffee, and soda. The chef who made my omelet every morning is so pleasant and she remembered me because I ordered the same thing every day. There is usually someone greeting you at the entrance of the restaurant where breakfast is served. They will ask for your room key and then cheerfully say, \"Enjoy your breakfast.\" Our room was nice and modern and spacious for 2 people. As per the usual Embassy Suites room, we had a sitting area with a couch, chair, and desk. We had 2 TVs, one for the \"living room\" and the other for the bedroom. There is also a desk, as well as a fridge, which is great for storing drinks. There is also a coffee maker, and they provide you with a bottle of water, but according to the tag around the bottle of water, it costs $4.95. It was also nice to have 2 closets, which allowed plenty of space for 2 girls. The interesting thing about the desk is that the socket doesn't provide electricity to charge your phone or other electronic equipment, so make sure you check that when charging electronics. The beds were comfortable. You can hear hallway noise sometimes, but fortunately that didn't bother us too much. Our room was by the staircase, which made it easy for us to go to and from the lobby as long as the towel was stuffed in the door. The bathroom was standard, slightly small, and the bathtub looked a little rusty. Water pressure was fine, but the tub wouldn't drain as quickly with the shower on, so you would be standing in a little bit of water while showering. The good thing is that the sink had a lot of counter space and is not in the same place as the shower, so that one person could be showering while the other was brushing teeth. There is a business center with 3 computers and a printer. The computer is a little bit slow, but there are direct links to airlines to you can check in and print out your boarding passes easily. There is also a small exercise room with about 3 treadmills and 1 elliptical machine. Each has its own Cardio Theater, which is great. You have to bring your own headphones. There are also a limited number of weights. Most people, though, chose to go running outside, swim, or play golf because the weather was quite nice this time of year. Overall, this was a good place to stay for the travelers who are here for a conference and have limited time to explore Phoenix because they have to be at the conference. The golf course and swimming pool are located behind the hotel. The hotel is quiet and in a residential area of Paradise Village. It is a 15 minute walk to some of the nearby restaurants. If you stay here and wish to go other places, you will either have to take a taxi or drive a car.

They put a hold on a significant portion that can take up to 3 weeks to get released; I found it interesting that when I commented on the wi-fi charge, the person at the front desk later tracked me down and gave me an article on hotels charging for wi-fi. The basic premise is that since people now use cell phones, hotels have lost a big source of revenue from the use of in-room phones so thay make it up with wi-fi charges. When I stated that many hotel chains and mom & pop motels provide it free, the person argued with me and said he had worked in a number of hotels and they all charge for wi-fi.

The room was nice and clean (one door handle was crusty & sticky), well decorated and comfortable. The views from the room overlooking the golf course and mountains in the distance was very beautiful. We had a couple of issues with noise resulting in loss of sleep. The first was that a large convention was in the hotel for the same weekend and the participants were mainly younger teens to young adults. They were everywhere in the hotel in full costume at all hours and were very loud. We heard them loudly laughing, talking and running thru the hallways at all hours of the days and night, Maybe the hotel could have booked non-conference guests into a separate floor(s) to separate us a bit. Also contributing to the lack of sleep was that the grounds crew starts to mow the greens on the golf course at about 4 am. The convention participants completely took over all the public areas of the hotel during the weekend and we noticed that the elevator (very smelly!) and hallways got a bit dirty. We too experienced the long delay in getting hot water that another review commented on. It seems like a large waste of water to have to run it for many, many minutes before getting water hot enough to shower in. The other complaint I have is one which is generalized to all hotels but this one is also guilty of. All the rooms we have stayed in over the past many years all have messages in them about how they are committed to environmental issues and ask guests to support them in their practices to reduce the use of water and detergent by reducing the volume of laundry. They ask guests to clearly show the housekeeping staff if they want new towels by either putting them on the floor or in the tub. This never happens. All towels are replaced every time they come in the room even if they are hung on hooks/towel bars or folded neatly on the counter (as was the case in this hotel as there were no hooks or towel bars in the sink area of the bathroom). We find this very irritating and frustrating. Lastly, our impression of the complimentary breakfast was that it fine. It was very busy during the weekend and the line for omelettes was long but the cooks were really amazingly organized and efficient. We enjoyed the fresh fruit, oatmeal and pancakes. The coffee was good. We tried to be there early rather than later.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cFine choice\u201d", "Author": "lindaraj1962", "ReviewID": "UR26662067", "Content": "Chose this facility based upon the reviews on Tripadvisor. I normally prefer the service/amenities of a four or five star hotel but on this particular trip I knew we would basically just be sleeping here and not spending a great deal of time at the hotel. We ordered room service for dinner all three nights and not only was the service quick, but the food was actually very good! We were on the fourth floor and it took a good seven minutes before any hot water made it to the shower. I was quite concerned and thought I would have to move, but I learned to just turn on the shower and go brush my teeth and take my meds while the water was arriving! The only real negative was the free breakfast. Nasty! We only tried it once. The scrambled eggs were very cold and spongy. Literally. They had little tiny air bubble holes and felt like a sponge in your mouth. The potatoes were also cold. Although this part is not the fault of the hotel, it still annoys me. The people there for breakfast were rude! Good grief....why does \"free\" make people forget their manners?

The GOOD: My father, brother and I booked a 2 bedroom suite with a view of the golf course. I called this hotel the day before our arrival and left a message for the hotel manager, Jessica, confirming ourselves into a good room and upon arrival she greeted us and had us reserved in room 6013 (possibly the best view of the golf course and on the top floor). The room was clean, spacious, updated and as previously mentioned had a spectacular view. The shower was spacious and never had a problem with not having the towels restocked. The cleaning ladies were friendly and efficient as well. There are a lot of stores and restaurants surrounding this hotel and within walking distance (Olive Garden, Subway, McDonalds, Outback Steakhouse and Target among others). The pool and hotub area were well maintained and set to a perfect temperature. We were also able to walk the golf course and enjoy the scenery as the fairways and greens were in pristine condition. Every morning they held a make-to-order omelet breakfast that lasted from 6:00am-9:30am which also held a wide range of breakfast items from muffins, bagels, toast, coffee, juices, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, fruit, yogurt and pancakes. Each night the hotel had Managers Reception which allowed all guests of legal drinking age to enjoy complimentary drinks from 5:30pm-7:30pm. The BAD: When booking this hotel a big advantage this hotel had over others was the complimentary full breakfast it offered. Unfortunately the hotel staff did not seem ready for the amount of guests it had booked during the long weekend. The seating area was not able to hold the amount of guests booked at this hotel and had guests venturing out to the bar area and lobby in order to have breakfast. Ontop of this, it was rare to even see one bus-boy clearing tables leaving guests to set dirty trays wherever they could find. The line-up to get an omelet averaged around 15-25 minutes and getting to the other types of food in the chafing dishes was always a challenge as well. I have been to the Embassy Suites in San Diego and LA and both had bigger and better lobby areas as well. Don't get me wrong, a lobby does not make or break a hotel but I just remember being \"wowed\" in San Diego when walking into the main entrance and seeing fish swimming in the indoor pond and being able to walk over the bridge having the fish swim directly beneath you compared to walking into the E.S. in Scottsdale and seeing... a normal lobby. The Ugly: What I still am scratching my head over is the fact this hotel just underwent renovations to update the rooms and hallways yet decided against renovating the elevators. Such a small cost yet it was left untouched. They were the only thing in this whole hotel that looked dated. Again, an elevator doesn't make or break a hotel but if I were the owner, I'd reconsider that decision. All in all we enjoyed our visit to Phoenix and had a good time at the Embassy Suites. It was a nice place to come back to after a long day of doing tourist activities. I think if I visited this hotel when it was not a long weekend the breakfast service would not have been an issue. I would recommend for the owners of the hotel to invest some more money into some minor renovations to possibly turn this 3 star hotel into a 4 star.

I would say its above average for Scottsdale hotels unless you go the resort route and I don't count this place as a resort. The hotel was very nice... the staff very helpful and courteous. Breakfast was typical embassy suites fare, but for the rate we paid, a nice asset. Our room was fine, not dirty (and I am a dirt freak) in the least. The bed was rather soft and yes the sheets did not fit and the door does slam rather loudly, but none were dealbreakers for us. I should mention that the hotel was only about 50% full so perhaps that made things more tolerable in terms of the noise, breakfast, etc. Not sure what it would be like during spring training which is the busiest time of year. The only real bummer was trying to get my cell phone charger back that fell out of my bag in the room. Lost and found there was kind of lame... They had to charge me with a cc# for packing it up and shipping it even though I offered to give them a fedex # and ups #.... Charging for putting it in a fedex envelope? While in Scottsdale, be sure to try Don and Charlies. YUM! A great place for steak lovers and baseball fans.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria", "Title": "\u201cProbably Won't Return\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4230554", "Content": "Husband and I had a long stay of 12 days. We had to wait a little over a hour for room to be ready, so no early check in here. I had asked for a quiet room with a view. There was no gaurantee that we would have a room with a view unless we paid $20 more a night, so we choose to pay. I ended up with a room over the swimming pool which was all but quiet.The carpet was so stained and dirty that you did not want to walk around bare footed. The couch was stained especially on the arms. The dining room menu had very little selections but with high prices. I don't think there was much help in the kitchen. The bed was uncomfortable, not because of the mattress but because of the bedding that did not fit. Small gift shop for a hotel this size. We had made reservations to eat the Thanksgiving Buffet. There were not many names on the reservations when I made reservations for 3. Our table was the worse in the whole dining room, right in the isle so people had to pass our table. We asked for another table but was told the tables were already assigned even though there were other empty table with 3 place settings and chairs. The doors of the rooms closed loudly so each time someone near you left their room you would hear it. Unfortunately a family with 4 or 5 children ran up and down the hallways and in and out of their rooms slamming their doors each time. It would actually shake the wall. We complained to management but it didn't help and there was no follow up by management regarding the complaint. If it wasn't that it was holiday week, we would have tried to move to another hotel. The free full breakfasts and the free drinks at Manager's nights are some of the nice amenities. The personnel was very friendly and attentive. Overall I would not return, for what we ended up paying for 12 days and what we got we could have paid an extra $50 a night and got a 4 star hotel with cleaner, more comfortable room and it would have been worth it.", "Date": "December 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monroe, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cElegent Style and Friendly Service\u201d", "Author": "scott104", "ReviewID": "UR3696666", "Content": "After a nightmare at Day\u2019s Inn my wife and I decided to stay at Embassy Suites. All rooms come with a separate bedroom. Our early check in was greeted with a warm and friendly smile. They had plenty of rooms (off season) and we had no problems getting a room well before the check in time of 3PM. Our room was extremely clean. Our balcony on the 6th floor overlooking the golf course and the majestic mountains in the distance only fit two people. You can enter in the bathroom from the bedroom or the living room. The kitchenette provided us with a coffee maker, refrigerator, and a microwave. The bedroom closet included a room safe and ironing board. All the essentials you need while traveling. The high speed internet provider is waypoint. With a $10.00 a day fee you can retrieve your emails. The desk was situated between the kitchenette and the living room and included a nice leather swivel chair. I had to say, this arrangement was quite stylish. They had complimentary cocktails at happy hour between 5pm and 7pm which we could not enjoy. We did, however, enjoy the complimentary breakfast. The friendly staff had eggs, home fries, pancakes, omelets, and plenty of coffee to start your day. It was absolutely delicious. If you take into account how much you would pay for breakfast and happy hour, take off the $129.00 per night stay and you will realize that the rooms are really not that expensive. The other reviews here stated that the elevators were slow. In agreement that you do have to wait 30 seconds to 1 minute longer than average, I cannot possibly count this as a negative towards my review. If you are on vacation or on business, and you come from the east coast as I do, the slower pace in the southwest is refreshing change from high stress of the east. This slower life style is integrated in every aspect of Phoenix, Arizona. So relax or take the stairs. Every detail was taken care of at our stay at Embassy Suites. Located near the mall in Scottsdale, and just 10 minutes from highway 51, I don\u2019t think that you can stay at a finer hotel.", "Date": "July 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flagstaff AZ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "eslkerry", "ReviewID": "UR3576363", "Content": "We stayed at this Embassy Suites after staying at the one near the Biltmore last year for our yearly Girl's Weekend Out!. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were in Room 5012 at the end of one wing, overlooking the pool and golf course and driving range. The extra few dollars we paid for a guaranteed view room was worth it. We sat on the balcony after dark when it cooled down and enjoyed the lights too. The view was great and we did not hear any of the dreaded tee time calls. Without repeating what others have said, we did take advantage of free drinks by the pool from 5:30-7:30 with some snacks available. In contrast to others, we were glad that drinks were in plastic glasses as we were by the pool. We noticed that some folks were ordering snacks from the restaurant at the same time. We also enjoyed the breakfast (also free) and never had a hard time finding a seat or waiting too long in line for omelettes. The pool is indeed a little small for the size of the hotel, but surprisingly, the pool itself wasn't terribly overcrowded on the Fri, Sat and Sunday that we were there and I understand they were close to being full this weekend. It was a little hard to find lounge chairs, but mostly because we wanted one in the shade and two in the sun. Picky picky. The two beds were double and seemed short - not a problem for me, but someone tall might have a tough time. I didn't think they were overly hard either - slept well. We ordered room service on Friday night after more drinks than were advisable to drive for dinner and the food was fairly good, plentiful and no more expensive than usual. It is close to shopping - Paradise Valley mall is an older mall, but we certainly didn't have trouble spending money. There are also many other stores nearby. We had little interaction with the desk area after check in which was easy and the clerk was courteous. Towels were quickly supplied as was room service.", "Date": "June 19, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Embassy Suites Phoenix-Scottsdale", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d224250-Reviews-Embassy_Suites_Phoenix_Scottsdale-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$92 - $193*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4415 East Paradise Village Parkway South</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85032</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516161", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/72/5f/725fa723ce7e1ce28f1a9b60a6cd11ec4large.jpg"}}
