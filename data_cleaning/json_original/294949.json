The room was clean and cosy, but probably would be a bit too small for 2 persons, especially the bathroom, which from the standpoint of ergonomics was rather uncomfortably designed. Another grouse is a fairly limited selection of English-language TV channels, not even the CNN. Otherwise, the hotel is quite good and very conveniently located in the heart Pera -- if one is in town to enjoy the night life, or to visit some consulates on nearby Istiklal street, the cab station is right round the corner too.

We had a very nice time in Istanbul and in the hotel despite some small hitches. First, the pluses. This historic hotel has undergone a great restoration and breathes olde worlde athmosphere and charm. Lobby is great with little nooks with seats. Tea served in the afternoon is great. The drinks are good and the bar also has this olde worlde thing. Their breakfast is really great. Rooms are decent, clean and comfy. Bathrooms are pretty with a smallish but comfy tub. The hotel has an Ok fit center and a nice hammam and relax area. They have perfect concierge people. However, the reception staff lacks behind. When I was booking, I was drawn by the picture of the deluxe (=basic) room balcony overlooking the Golden Horn. I asked for my two rooms to be on the highest floor with a balcony. I also asked to have tea and coffee facilities in the room. I informed them that these were my conditions for booking. The answer was - yes, of course, we'll do our best. Well, it seems that their best was to \"accommodate\" these request as available at the moment of checking-in! If I had known that, I would have booked a different hotel. So they'll promise anything when booking without regard to what is actually possible. Later I found out that the photos are actually from a suite, not from a room at all, and the big premium you're paying is for a view of a small sliver of water but mainly of a four-way motorway and a football stadium. Well, at least we were not staring into a wall for 250\u00e2\u201a\u00ac... And they had the chucpe to offer me an upgrade \"only\" for 100\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per night, if I wanted to have the room I actually wanted to book in the first place. The other unpleasant thing was that the drains in the bathroom smelled badly. They have a separate drain for the tub and for the water that splashes out of the tub. But evidently the cleaning ladies do not pour enough water into the second one, maybe they wash the shower walls only once per stay, so every time I got into the tub / shower, there was this smell of unused drain. Of course it helped to pour some water out, but it should not be the guest doing it. The third little unpleasant surprise was the price of drinks in this place. Not quite the remortgage level, but surprisingly hefty compared to the area and Istanbul in general. Well, it didn't keep us from ordering them... Just keep these things in mind when you're booking and you won't feel such discrepancy between the price and the value as I did.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDon't bother\u201d", "Author": "RAWELondon", "ReviewID": "UR128335197", "Content": "Frankly, you can do a lot better in Istanbul for a lot less money.

Few hotels can boast the range of roles in fiction than the Pera Palace, showing up as it does in Agatha Christie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Murder on the Orient Express, Ian Fleming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s From Russia with Love and Alfred Hitchcock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Lady Vanishes. As I arrived in the colonnaded marble hall, a group of greeters in crisp grey tails and black foulard pounced on me with alarming servility, purring 'Welcome to Pera Palace. Let us help you'. It was an introduction that sums up the time-honored traditions of old Istanbul, and this legendary pearl first opened in 1892 in the twilight years of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey's first Western hotel has recently undergone a four-year $30million much-needed facelift to restore it to its old school splendor and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 'museum-hotel'. First opened in 1892 of the Ottoman Empire to serve European passengers of the Orient Express train, the hotel had the city's first elevator (still working) and was the first building in Istanbul, other than the Ottoman palaces, to have hot water and electricity. Eminent guests included Greta Garbo, Mata Hari, King Edward VIII, Queen Elizabeth II, Emperor Franz Joseph, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Sarah Bernhardt, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Alfred Hitchcock and Ernest Hemingway. It was not by chance that it attracted Agatha Christie, who is said to have written some of Murder on the Orient Express in Room 411, although in the novel she has Hercule Poirot check into the now demolished Hotel Tokatlian once located nearby. The soaring lobby leads to the majestic, domed Kubbeli Saloon and Tea Lounge with its soaring domed ceiling and bold striped walls and 'Arabian Nights' ambience; the Orient Bar and the Patisserie de Pera have a nostalgic charm. A new basement level features a spa and Turkish bath, as well as the refined Agatha restaurant (named after Agatha Christie, the hotel's most famous guest), run by the buoyant chef Maximilian JW Thomae, who fashioned the menu to reflect the notable stops on the Orient-Express: Paris, Venice and Istanbul by mixing French, Italian and Turkish delights including a heavenly chilled artichoke soup with quail kebab served on a steaming bed of Asian risotto. Also, I had one of the best breakfasts of my life at the hidden away Patisserie de Pera, a charming in-house patisserie which serves French pastries, macaroons, amazing healthy omelets and pots of strong, steaming coffee in grand hotel style. a delightfully nostalgic setting for breakfast, The restoration have preserved the hotel's orientalist d\u00c3\u00a9cor, strongly evocative of fin-de-si\u00c3\u00a8cle Constantinople, faithful to the original designs and color schemes in the public spaces, but the 115 rooms have been completely reconstructed to make them uber comfy including all the latest tech gadgets. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, they still highlight original nineteenth-century features like white Carrara marble and gorgeous Murano glass chandeliers My room boasts a comfy French balcony with stunning views from Galata to the Golden Horn, from the slopes of Eyup to Tepebasi. Inside, antique paintings, classic furniture and rich fabrics convey an aura of fascination and elegance. Also with Golden Horn views are the two Presidential Suites. Liberally sized at 115 square meters, and located on the fourth and fifth floors of the hotel, the living areas include dining room, living room and study, as well as a huge dressing room which would make the Housewives of Beverly Hills jealous and separate guest bathrooms. Nothing beats the jetlag of a long transatlantic trip like a scintillating spa treatment and the Pera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 380-square-meter spa facilities (managed by Spa Soul in cooperation with world famous Swiss Spa brand After the Rain,) offers an indoor jet stream swimming pool, steam bath, Jacuzzi, sauna and a fully equipped gym, and a traditional Turkish hammam. Treatments are named after celebrity guests like Greta Garbo, the Divine or Hemingway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Choice treatment for men. If first impressions are anything to go by, grande dame of Istanbul definitely captures the bygone glamour days of the Ottoman Empire.

It is situated on an elevated part of the city and one side of the hotel has views of the city and sea. Not far from a major pedestrianised shopping area with multiple taxis available close by. From the moment you arrive one notices the genuine friendly and hospitable attitude to guests. Turks are naturally friendly, proud of their identity and welcome you to their country. The hotel is immaculately clean and well maintained - in the old fashioned style. They even have a working elevator from 1892 - the first in Istanbul. Yes, they also have modern elevators. You can feel the history of this hotel where famous people have stayed. The public rooms are beautiful with impeccable service. Their food is excellent if you want to dine in and there is a swimming pool and gymnasium if you want to work off the calories. Everything is beautifully presented and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Service with a capital S. Ask for a room - if possible, with views and imagine yourself whisked back in time to the 1920's. The downside? Only one that I noticed. The walls of the rooms are paper thin and so one can hear everything from the adjoining room. Conversations, footsteps - everything. Not a problem if the adjoining room is empty but a major turn off if you are trying to sleep and the person next door is operating on a different time zone!

Thankfully, the original elevator has been preserved, as has the d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the Kubbeli Saloon, and the Ataturk museum room (open to the public by appointment) remains as it was during our original visit years ago. The renovation of the Orient Bar had not yet been completed during our late July, 2011 visit. The rooms and suites have been fully modernized and are spacious and well furnished, though without much ambience that would invoke the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ottoman history. My overall rating for this property would be above average if this were the only factor considered. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s implementation of a modern, customer-oriented service component has been less successful than the physical renovation. Individual staff members were, with a few exceptions, extremely pleasant and eager to oblige, when able to do so. For example, the concierge desk, having recommended a restaurant a few blocks away, sent along one of the young bellmen to walk with us through the area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confusing maze of streets. That was nicely done. On the other hand, the concierge desk, when asked for restaurant recommendations, pushed several that have been identified in other reviews as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concierge favorites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at several of the big hotels, and which offered indifferent food at exorbitant prices. Yet they did not mention a very fine restaurant just ten steps away. (We found it ourselves on Tripadvisor!). Unfortunately, the front desk did not measure up to what should be expected in a first-class establishment. Interactions ranged from cold to hostile. Our rooms weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready at checkin and we were upsold to what they called suites, though one of the two rooms certainly was not a suite. We were cheerily informed by one staff member that our room rate included breakfast, but after being presented with a bill at breakfast the next day we inquired at the front desk and were told no, the room did not include breakfast. When I said that we had been told it did by the staff member (who was then standing right next to the receptionist) the reply was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153she made a mistake.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The breakfast charge was there at checkout, itself a very confused process entailing three separate credit card charges. Overall, the front desk operation was not customer-friendly, and was a weak point. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this hotel for a tourist visitor. The areas worth seeing are open to the public, and in summer a walk through the lobby and Kubbeli Saloon, followed by a cool drink on the outdoor terrace, might be worthwhile. A visit to Ataturk's room offers a rare chance to glimpse the private life of one of the 20th Century's greatest political figures. For a business visit on an expense account, it would be a good choice if the business to be done is in the vicinity.

It is a couple of blocks away from istiklal street, one of the main attractions of the city. In order to give other future travellers to IStanbul some hints, during the mornings it is wise to go see the Blue Mosque, Aya sofia, topkapi palace and other landmarks of istabul. They are all located in on area and very easy to travel between the attractions on foot. Spend the day in Sultanahmet area as there is a lot going on there. however, there is nothing in that area at night, hence istiklal road becomes the main attraction with all the bars and cafes that it offers.

Kaan from the Concierge is the most amazing guy we met in Turkey. he was very helpful, made some wonderful restaurant recommendations, and i highly recommend the Istanbul Balik restaurant under the Galat bridge for the best SeaBass ever! However, excpect to pay exceptional amounts for this! Word of advise though! Turkish people are very nice in general, they would love to help although there is this language barrier that might be a bit of a hassle. They love their culture and language that's why they stick to it and i personally like that about them. However, please watch out for the cab drivers!!! These are the slickest, most sly living things on earth! They will do ANYTHING to get the max out of your pocket. DO NOT go for the meter if you are travelling in a cab for a short distance! We had to take a cab once for a 10min drive that usually costs less than 10TL bacause it was raining. Upon our arrival to our destination, the meter MAGICALLY showed a horrendous figure 43TL!!! Although i was screening the meter every couple of seconds. I tried telling the driver nicely that i will not be paying that amount since i knew it was not correct. He tried convincing me that this is the meter and he can't do anything about it. I told him i don't care what is going to happen, i am not paying even if we had to have an arguement infront of everyone in the streets of Istanbul. I stopped one of the passersby and asked him for the number of the police. He offered nicely to interfer and talk to the cab driver, who finally surrendered and said only this time he will accept half the money since we are tourists! inorder to cut it short, agree witht he cab driver the fee BEFORE you get in, make sure you ask your hotel how much it will cost!

Other than that, it was a pleasure to be at the renovated Pera Palace, which I remembered as a faded grande dame in the 1980s.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "emekli", "ReviewID": "UR18828294", "Content": "I think you should take this hotel off your list of available hotels;since it is and will be closed thru 2010 due to renovations, resulting from transfer of ownership.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cLovely old hotel\u201d", "Author": "Wereldreizigster", "ReviewID": "UR11214744", "Content": "We stayed here when my husband had to do a presentation in Istanbul.

Had a huge room with views, was once quite opulent, but now faded (as is the whole hotel) but still was amazing charm and beauty. Got a great deal on the room, by booking directly with hotel - and thought it was absolutely worth the price (we stayed a WEEK there!) Location is actually fantastic, you are right in the hippest part of Istanbul with tons of cafes, restaurants, bars, and shopping withing a five minute walk (plus one of the most architecturally distinctive parts of the city). Great neighborhoods all around it, and it is (thankfully) AWAY from the tourist hustling of SultanAhmet - we found that to be extremely tiresome to be constantly harrased by touts in Sultanahmet. Taxis are $4 to get to Sultanamhet during the day, and at night, you are already in the heart of things. Can't recommend it enough - thought it really made our stay in Istanbul fabulous. Oh, we first booked three nights via the hotel website (cuz we were not sure we would want to stay there the whole time), and then we went to the front desk and got an even better rate for the last 4 nites - something to think about. If you're looking for more upscale rooms/environmen, the Marmara is right across the street (great bar, great views) - but is three times the price (but also has a rooftop pool that we were dying to go into!). From the elevator, to the lobby boys, to the large room, to the cool neighborhood, we loved it.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pera Palace Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d294949-Reviews-Pera_Palace_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$263 - $573*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "294949", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/34/b9/34b907bcb88bd297e64938d82cf50d467large.jpg"}}
