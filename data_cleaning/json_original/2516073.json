The hotel is two buildings, the first being roadside and the second overlooking the pool. We had an executive king room in the roadside building.

We are from San Diego so we know Hollywood is a little rough but we wanted to walk to the Kodak Theatres and see the sites on the way. So we read TA reviews and booked this hotel. I don't think the parking is free anymore but we found a parking spot right next to the hotel. We were planning to pay for parking but this spot was literally next door. So I think we saved 12.00. The lobby has many pictures hanging of famous actors and was going for the old Hollywood Vibe. The hotel is in rectangle shape with the pool in the middle. Our room was on the bottom floor and when we entered the room we were surprised with all of the art they had up. It was similiar to the lobby but they had even cooler pictures, some were even new like Harry Potter and old like the Beatles. We were able to walk all the way to the Kodak Theatres from our hotel and see everything on the way and get some good food. Maybe a mile or two. It was a little seedy until we actually got to Hollywood Boulevard, which is funny to say because the Boulevard is a litte seedy. What I really mean is unlike the Boulevard where there is traffic and stores, where we walked, it did not have alot of pedestrians walking around. If my husband was not there, I probably wouldn't have walked by myself (even though I know I would have because I would convince myself not be a wimp). I didn't get to eat at the restaurant because we were going to try out this awesome breakfast place down the road. If you want to cheap hotel close to Hollywood Boulevard this is it. I am more of a people watcher person so I would probably stay more on the boulevard if I had too this again but that would also cost about about $100 more.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, RI", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel\u201d", "Author": "kafkirk", "ReviewID": "UR124805323", "Content": "We stayed here for five nights in Feb 2012.

It was my first time staying here so I did not know what to expect. The hotel does a wonderful job keeping everything clean, from the lobby to the bedrooms. I stayed in room 124, which is on the first floor across from the pool. The room was spacious, clean, and very modern looking. The bathroom was big too. The room had a coffee maker, refrigerator and microwave. I was able to get the room for $108 a night. I believe if you have AAA it may be cheaper. The air conditioner worked well. The only problem I had, was that you could hear everything. My sleep was interrupted many times because I could hear the people who were hanging out by the pool area. I could also hear the TV in the room next to me. Room 124 is right by the ice machine. A plus and negative at the same time. Unfortunately, I could hear when people were getting ice. Which kind of stinks when it is 3AM and your trying to sleep. I believe it took us about 15-20min to walk to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Do yourself a favor, and walk over to the W hotel which is about four blocks away from the Best Western Hollywood Hills, and go to the Metro station and buy a $5.00 subway pass. You can use this all day. Take the subway to Hollywood and Wine where all the action is, and it will drop you off right by the Kodak theatre within a matter of minutes. There is also a outdoor mall. This was very handy when I did not want to deal with the many people laying on the street asking for money. Attached to this hotel is a GREAT place to eat. I highly recommend ordering the chocolate brownie waffle, which comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup drizzled on top. A wonderful dessert, enough for two people to share.

However once inside the Hotel we were very impressed. The Hotel staff were welcoming and were very helpful with excellent knowledge of LA and its attractions. Our twin double bedded room was clean, comfortable and very roomy, we were particularly impressed with the large television and the spacious en-suite bathroom. Initially we were concerned with the road which our room overlooked but found that the little noise pollution wasn't a issue at all especially during the night. Quite possibly the best thing about the hotel was the amazing '101 cafe'. The cafe was reasonably priced- especially for the enormous portions of food and is open pretty much 24-7, it always had a relaxed atmosphere and a cool retro interior. The hotel is situated about a ten minute walk from Sunset Blvd and a twenty minute walk up the hill to the Hollywood sign, we both found the hotel excellent value for money and would certainly stay there again in the future.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "nocturnalgirl72", "ReviewID": "UR64333512", "Content": "Lobby was very small and non exciting but check in was fast.

However upon arrival this Hollywood charm was what I found. The reception staff were very helpful upon check-in, they upgraded me and my friend to a Double Queen and it was absouletly huge. The room had a seating area, 2 queen beds, a kitchen, a desk with wireless internet access and the biggest hotel bathroom I have ever seen. We even had his & her sinks with a huge shower. It really did impress me and I think the majority of the reviews on this website are just from people expecting a five star hotel at low prices. If you want 5 star pay for it! The location of the hotel was fabulous right on the doorstep was Hollywood Blvd, the home of The Walk of Fame, Manns Chinese Theater, Kodak Theater and close to transportation networks. However if you are planning your L.A. trip and you are over 25 I highly recommend hiring a car, the roads are easy but public transport is awful! Everyone drives in L.A. so there transport system doesnt have to be great. However if you are not keen on driving out there the bus is cheap however ask reception for the right route you need and they will direct you to the bus stop. Or use the Metro subway system compared to London's Tube and New York's subway it is a small system with only 4 networks within the system. But again is extremely cheap! Also my top tip:- book a tour to see the Movie Star homes, many visit the homes of Hollywoods biggest celebritys on Mulholland Drive and also the sights of Bel Air and Beverly Hills including the oh so glamourous Rodeo Drive (take your credit cards if you plan to shop there just to warn you prices normally start from $500 for a small garmet and can go over $50,000 for evening dresses and shoes!). Tours are around $35 roughly 3 hours long. Also another tip: - DO NOT TAKE A CAB FROM THE AIRPORT in high traffic it can cost you up to $70 from LAX, so try and arrange a private car from the hotel or a respected company which will cost you around $55 excluding tip. This will save you money. I think L.A. would appeal to adults however young children Hollywood may not be suitable. If you are planning a holiday to California with the kids, try Anahiem or San Diego were it is more family friendly. Overall the hotel was fabulous, the location extremely convient and L.A. is just incredible!! P.S. eat at the popular celebrity hangout Coffee 101 one lunchtime.

There was a small refrigerator, along with a microwave and coffee pot, behind a sliding door. The large bathroom was really nice: beautiful tile all around, with a walk-in, 2-person shower. The staff seemed professional and responsive. I usually avoid hotels with exterior corridors, but the doors and key system seemed secure. I'm very picky about hotels, and I think this was a good value for the Hollywood area. I should mention that another guest's car was broken into one night while I was there, but that comes with the territory. I also spent 2 nights in the nearby Rennaissance on this trip, and I'm not sure the $200 per night difference in cost was worth it, unless you include the celebrity sightings at the Rennaissance.
