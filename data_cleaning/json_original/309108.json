{"Reviews": [{"Content": "beautiful hotel we got married at the Bali Hai, Tuban, in September 05 and it was fantastic, lovely food and a beautiful day, Rani weddings the company that deal at the Bali Hai were so helpful and accomodating, flowers were great, although don't sign any bar bills from the night until the next day when your not intoxicated as there were a few extras on our bill which we had removed before signing. The hotel was lovely and clean. Happy hour is great!!!!! The themed food nights with entertainment were quite expensive although food was tasty. Lots of great nightlife in Kuta some posh bars and be sure to hit the bounty club, lots of nice restaurants although make sure you get out early as they shut around 11ish. Everything is so cheap you can't spend your money, we wouldn't go to Europe again unless it's all inclusive. For a lovely cheap day and gorgeous beach head to Nusa Dua theres a great little beach shack next to where the Bali Hai drop off for Scuba Diving. For great waves head to Jimbaran Bay. Sanur beach was quite dirty although there is a fab Japanese restaurant. You can get some bargains at the market but be prepared to barter away don't except the first price half it and more before buying. Bali is such a lovely island a great holiday where you can do as little or as much as you wish.", "Date": "Apr 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR277017341", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "garkell"}, {"Content": "Beautiful The resort was just beautiful. We stayed in a garden room facing the pool and it was good, clean. Loved the swim up pool bar- happy hour was at 5 then we were able to go to happy hour in the other indoor bar from 6 all ready for dinner.They have a gorgeous beach eating area where a band will walk around for entertainment. All entertainment in the resort was fantastic- it was a great relief from the busy Bali streets.Don't book your tours before you go- Balihai has a great tour desk which was a fair bit cheaper than our travel agent.", "Date": "Sep 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR568392942", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cheesy_jo"}, {"Content": "Bali Hai was great Having stayed at the Bali Hai Resort, this is a perfect hotel which caters very well for families and couples who enjoy an immense range of facilities and lifes luxuries.With regards to the room which we booked included two superior rooms as this would accommodate my wife and two teenage children. However we were quite disappointed with the room in which we were allocated. It was located on the bottom floor and was located towards the from of the hotel. It was obvious that these rooms were quite old and were often given away first. I would highly recommed avoiding the room we were given which was rooms 1134 and 1135. Whilst these rooms were adquate our expectations of our room were not exceed, however they were functional. In my opinion guests should be asking for the standard rooms which are closer to the beach, these rooms are usually no more expensive. Rooms 1109 - 1116 / 2209 - 2216 / 3309 - 3316 1149 - 1159 2249 / 2260 / 3349 - 3358 1100 - 1108. These rooms are all the normal standard room type, so ask for these. Rooms with the number 1 in front are located on the first floor, rooms with 2 at the front are located on the second floor ect.", "Date": "Jun 15, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR390930077", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Superbe h\u4e48tel       Piscine et bar", "Date": "Aug 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR165261108", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Fred_611"}, {"Content": "Sympa !
