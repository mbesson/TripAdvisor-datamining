It was evident the place was short of staff as there were a lot of people waving or raising their arms to catch the waiter\u00b4s attention. We even witnessed many guests getting up and going inside to place drink orders. When the waiter finally came to our table, he asked us what we wanted but we requested to see the menu first. Our request seemed to be quite unusual for him as he gave us a look of surprise. He came back a few minutes later with a dirty menu which was a real let down. We ordered two different brands of gin listed on the menu and they were not available (5-star?). Drinks were delivered after a long time so we started to be a bit impatient as it was getting late for our appointment. It was a real struggle to get the bill and pay as staff were under a lot of pressure to serve so many people. Before leaving, we spoke to a gentleman in a suit, who seemed to be the Supervisor on duty. We told him that we were disappointed with the service and he said that the management were aware of the situation but didn\u00b4t apologize.

The room was lovely - huge and very comfortable bed and a very luxurious bathroom. Lots of posh spa products and dressing gowns are thrown in which was nice. The spa is small - the swimming pool is tiny and you are at one end before you have done more then 4 strokes, but as long as you only want to use it as a hot tub rather than proper swimming it is lovely. It also has a small gym with a couple of treadmills and a bike which we used and was perfectly adequate (in any event, the hotel is right by the Retiro park so you could go jogging round there if the gym was full).

Well when there is no steam and low temperature it can't be working properly. Still she thought about it and said maybe in one or two days they can have somebody come and look at it and then left. So that was lovely.. Had one very nice receptionist help me try to book a table at a nearby new restaurant unfortunately to no success and she was helpful with some relatively local spots. The hotel in general has an aging look, which is strange since it's only been open for 3 years. She showers in the rooms have these large tiles but in the gaps you can see they haven't been cleaned for probably 3 years. Red/orange stains everywhere.. Not a pretty sight. To claim this hotel 5 stars.. not sure who did the evaluation or maybe in the beginning when it opened it was nice. But going downhill fast. The room was a good size facing the back of the building but the walls were thin, could hear, but not over the top bad at all. It would be a nice 4 star place to stay in a chill neighborhood which is next to the metro and walking distance from gran via and all the places. But they should fix some of the small things that you immediately notice and probably stop you from come back like myself and my girl.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "Givemeaholiday", "ReviewID": "UR123308450", "Content": "Not the ultimate in Luxury, but very very comfotable beds, nice baths and ok shower, but mind the floor, the tiles move !!! there is no swimming pool ! it is a large bath, you cannot swim in it, but it is lovely to relax in it, and they let you in 24 hours a day. all in all a pleasant hotel, with free internet, my big bug ! so not a Luxury 5 Star, but nice all the same.

We stayed in the Dreamilne room. The Hotel is located at the main entrance of the El Retiro park at Plaza de laIndependencia. I believe that this is the best location to stay in Madrid unless you prefer to stay around Plaza de Sol which is actually the ground zero of Madrid. The area around Hospes is of high class, tranquility and at the same time with easy access to everything a tourist or business traveller might need. Salamanca area, El Retiro, Museums are in walking distance whereas the city center, is only 10 minute away by car. You can find a taxi instantly any time outside of the hotel and also Buses, Tour Buses station are just outside of the Hotel. Metro station is just a few meters away and the airport is maximum 20 minutes away. Moreove beside the entrance of the Hotel sis an 24 hour operating cafe/restaurant/bar (Ramses) which seems to be a hot point of the area. The Hotel itself is hosted in a classical old-Madrid style building fully renovated and well maintained. The decoration is bery modern and relaxing. All the personell we met spoke perfectly English and they were capable of providing high class services. What we love however about the Hotel was our room. It is one of the best rooms we have ever visited, perhaps the best in a city hotel. The room was quite big and it looked bigger as it is an open space room that combines, a very large twin bed, a sofa, and an open space marvelous marble bathroom. The WC was at a separate room also spacious. The furniture were modern but with a classic feel and the colours were very calm and relaxing. We did not taste the breakfast as we did not wake up early enough but it looked also of high standards, Overall we definetely recommend this hotel for everybody and for the price we got it, it was also great value for our money too (apart from the breakfast which is a bit expensive).", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLovely place to stay\u201d", "Author": "AlistairHurst", "ReviewID": "UR122146133", "Content": "Fantastic location, very nice rooms but an Englishman needs a kettle!

I also picked this hotel based on location (since I didn't really need to be in the middle) and ambiance of the hotel. Granted, I was a student the first time I was there so your experience and expectations are quite when you're 20 then when you're 33. My boyfriend and I stayed at Hospes Madrid in early November and had a wonderful time. Firstly, the location is amazing. It's right by the Retiro Park on the Puerta de Alcala in the Salamanca section of Madrid. It's a fairly chic residential area and near the high-end shopping area so if you are looking for something smack in the middle of the tourist stuff, this may not be for you. However, if you're looking for a chic little hotel in a nice neighborhood that is still in walking distance from the sites (Prado, Puerta del Sol, etc) this is a good alternative. The people at the desk were extremely helpful and nice. There is one guy, I can't remember his name, who did most of our reservations and planning and he was excellent. He recommended a great restaurant that was close by on the last night. We also got upgraded to a room facing the front with a balcony which was cool because the MTV awards were happening at the Puerta de Alcala that weekend. We live in NYC so noise isn't a major thing for us but if you're not used to street noise, I can see where a room facing the street could be annoying. The rooms themselves are quite spacious and well appointed. Agree with someone who said the rooms could definitely use desks! I had to do work on the trip so it was weird having to do it on the bed. The first room we had was an interior so we didn't have a lot of sunlight - we couldn't tell if it was sunny or not outside. However, it had a huge bath (I like baths) and the bathroom was nice. Yes, the closets have no doors but that didn't really bother us. The new room had plenty of light since we faced the street and the weather happened to be amazing the days we were there (sunny and 70s). No bath tub in the new room but that was ok. Again, I loved the location since it was in the residential area (similar to staying on the Upper East Side versus staying in Times Square or Midtown) and near the shops and the park. It was also easy to walk to the museums and everything (we live in NY so all we do is walk). The hotel was small and there wasn't much of a scene happening which is what we like. If you are looking for action, there is a hip bar/club/resto called Ramses next door. They were hosting an MTV party the week we were there. We also didn't eat at the hotel but apparently the restaurant there is very good. We were only there a few days and had already picked restaurants we wanted to eat at. We ate at Iroco, La Terraza del Casino (amazing!!), El Tomate, VIPs, and one more I can't remember). Food is amazing in Madrid! Another plus is that the wireless is free!

I want to share my experience so that you have an idea of what to expect. I stayed 3 nights, used all services including the SPA so I have a good idea of what this hotel can offer. 1. Check-in: quick and courteous, \"we'll send your bag right up sir\". I had half an hour to have a shower and go to my business dinner. After 20 minutes I came back down to get my own bag still in the lobby!! 2. The room: room is small, as in many European hotels, but critically there is no desk. Not a place where to use your laptop but in the bed. I immediately complained and asked to speak to the manager. The manager was \"busy\". Ok I'll talk to her tomorrow I thought. In the meantime I found the cover of an electric plug on the floor. I pick it up and leave it on the bedside table. Weird that the cleaning staff did not notice a plastic piece clearly coming from the plug on the floor. 3. Design: when you open the door a half closed safe welcomes you and some empty hangers. Yes the door opens onto the closet which has no doors. After 3 days of stay you need to use the closet so what welcomes you is your dirty shirts hanging, used ties or a bag with your dirty laundry and your empty luggage. I come from Milan home of the design and the first thing welcoming you is a closet with no doors is a big mistake. Even worse the bathroom is in plain sight from the bed (of course the two sinks not the toilette). Under the sink is a waste basket (the only one in the room). If you throw away the newspaper in the morning it will still be there saying good morning to you the following day (the turn down service at night does not empty it). Final negative note on the design: the lou is in a separate area with a door (finally :-) and there is the bidet to wash yourself. There are also towels to dry up but NO SOAP. Maybe the designers thought you just need water??? I put the soap there and the cleaning service took it away and put it back in plain view at the sink. 4. Cleaning staff. Remember the piece of electric plug I had picked up and put on the bedside table when I checked in? Well 3 days later it was still there on the bedside table!!! Maybe they think guests should repair the electric plugs themselves, I am no engineer so I did not do it, maybe I was wrong. On top of that I had moved the waste basket so that it was not in plain view when I woke up in the morning by putting it near the shower. All 3 days it was put back where it was in plan sight!! Maybe they think it adds to the visual experience to see not only your shaving cream, used razor, open soap, toothpaste when you wake up (remember no doors on the bathroom) they want to make sure you also see the waste basket in case you love it !!! 5. Manager: I have asked again on the 3 day to see manager and guess what?? Yes she was \"busy\" again. I tried one last time the morning I left and she was, again, \"busy\". When a manager has no time to see an unhappy customer for 3 days it already tells you a lot about the kind of hotel. 6. SPA. It was ok but with only one person as staff so you had to adapt to her schedule because they could not bring someone in from the outside. 7. Lobby: very small, derived from a corridor, not a place where to have a meeting but the coffee shop on the first floor is welcoming. Overall if you like some poor design, managers ignoring you, no place to sit down and work, a bidet where you are not supposed to wash yourself with soap and to look at your bathroom or closet from your bed than you have to stay here!!", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, NY", "Title": "\u201cDo not trust the front desk\u201d", "Author": "christiebeach", "ReviewID": "UR82990730", "Content": "I am sorry to say I never stayed at this hotel, although I paid to stay here.

The hotel location worked out well for us since we're tourist we're planning to hop on the Madrid Tour bus which stops right in front and across the street. The taxi ride from airport was less than 20 minutes about $25 euros and the taxi ride to the train station is less than 10 minutes about $10 euros. In addition the Retiro Park and Plaza de Independencia was right in front on the hotel. We also took some sight seeing tours from Julia Travel which is located next to Plaza de Espana and it's about $5 euros taxi ride from the hotel. The hotel entrance is a bit hard to notice, in fact our taxi driver almost missed it so be in the look out for the sign (also look for Cafe and Te, it's right next to the hotel). There are may ATMs near by the hotel which was convenient. We only used 2 services from the hotel; breakfast and laundry, both services (variety of food and laundry delivery time) were mediocre for the price. However the servers at breakfast are great. There is a Cafe and Te right next to the hotel, decent alternative to hotel food/price. Our room (307) is right next to the elevator, obviously we're a bit hesitant about hearing all the noises but we never did. Overall very comfortable room didn't have any problems with the exception of the pillow (it's quite soft per our preference). The bathroom is an open design with a separate toilet and shower (love the shower!) stall with glass door. It may or may not be ideal for business travelers as it does not have a proper desk to work on and the complimentary Wi-Fi signal was quite weak in our room. Iron and ironing board are available upon request. During our research for hotels in Madrid we read many comments (in general) about hotel receptionist being rude or not helpful. It depends on the individual, we flew British Airways to Madrid and BA lost my wife's luggage, we asked one of the receptionist to help us contact BA/Iberia to track down the luggage for us in Spanish. The individual we talked to was quite helpful and tried her best to assist us however a few others doesn't speak English that well and noticed it would be difficult for them to help. Overall it was an enjoyable stay, we paid about $150-$160 per night (discounted rate that is none refundable).", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, but major issues with the rooms\u201d", "Author": "DQC76", "ReviewID": "UR74867001", "Content": "Positives: - Great location ... very nice neighborhood and great access to everywhere you want to go - if you like boutique hotels, this hotel is along those lines ... small number of rooms, modern design, etc Negatives: - layout of the rooms is a DISASTER ... there are NO DOORS on the bathroom! i had a suite, and bed was directly facing the wide open bathroom (meaning stepping out of the shower directly facing the bed as there is no door) ... and of course, the shower door was glass, meaning that you can lay in bed & see reflection of the person in the shower - after changing rooms, the 2nd room was marginally better b/c the large headboard faced the wide open bathroom ... but only a marginal improvement - carpet on the wood floor was absolutely filthy (think a college dorm room) ... stained and worn - hotel on the verge of needing a refurb/upgrade as many of the pieces in the room are a bit worn - bar was like a morgue ... absolutely not a place to spend any amount of time i would like to be more charitable, but even the staff wasn't that helpful (though they tried & were friendly) ... given this place advertises itself as a 5-star, i expected a lot more so i cannot recommend", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGood location, very nice rooms.

The area is generally a business district and is quiet in the evenings, so if you are looking for nightlife and atmosphere on your doorstep this might not be the place. However a 15-20 minute stroll and you are in Old Madrid with its narrow streets, small bars and cafes. The hotel is very nicely decorated and is extremely comfortable. The rooms are open plan and the bathrooms are wonderfully kitted out with marble tiles, his and hers sinks, huge oval bath and a separate 'rain' type shower. One slight criticism is that there are no English speaking TV channels available in the rooms, although the TV brochure does advertise these. The staff are very pleasant and will go out of their way to help. We had two problems, both of which were resolved by the staff in a professional and very accommodating manner. A very good sign that they care about customer satisfaction and service. The hotel does lack a certain buzz, but this is maybe because it is still early days, but the hotel restaurant (Ramses) is a place to be been and was very buzzy all weekend. Overall a good stay and we would return if we were back in Madrid.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cStylish but needs to up its game\u201d", "Author": "Globaladventure", "ReviewID": "UR14519383", "Content": "Certainly if you are looking for a stylish, boutique hotel in Madrid - you would not go far wrong with the Hospes. It is in a great location, overlooking the city's main park and close to the key art galleries. The intimate environment has also been beautifully designed. Our bedroom was very nicely laid out, with an open plan bathroom (which is only fine, if you are on your own, or with someone you truly love....). The finish of the room could have been a little better (especially as the Hospes is not cheap) and the sink looked beautiful, but was a nightmare to use (shallow and not good for shaving). There was also a very nice intimate bar and restaurant, along with a lovely courtyard (which I am sure is great in the Summer). The staff are very friendly and helpful. However, the main fault of the hotel is it lacks the five star polish it markets itself to have. Tea trays that were delivered to the room had great crockery and glasswear, but were thrown together. Breakfast lacked polish - as did the bar (which also had a slight whiff of drains). There was also a lovely plasma screen in the room, which only had Spanish channels. If the hotel wishes to attract an international, well travelled clientele (especially business travellers), it is going to have to up its game. Not wanting to sound too negative - it is certainly a wonderful choice for a weekend/leisure break in Madrid. A bit of standards and training and it will be a great option.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, very fine hotel\u201d", "Author": "PortoTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR13840020", "Content": "Hotel Hopses Madrid is located in Plaza Independenzia, also known as Puerta de Alcal\u00e1, Madrids own \"Arc du Triomphe\". The outside architecture is typically early 20th century Madrid. The hotel is very close to the museum triangle, at the end of fashionable Serrano Street, Madrid's main shopping artery, and right across the entrance to the wonderful Retiro Park. You can easily stroll around on foot for a whole weekend, but taxi drives are inexpensive. The hotel experience is very pleasant. The staff is very friendly and attentive, the public rooms, although still lacking any patine, are charming and carefully thought, but empty and lacking in atmosphere. This will probably improve with time, as the hotel is still new, and relatively unknown, at least for cab drivers. The decor is a bit too glamour-urban-chic for my personal liking. Period furnishings painted white, black, silver or gold, combined with medium glitter fabrics seems to be the standard decor for fashion boutique hotels. Neighboring social mecca restaurant Ramses, by Philip Stark himself is of course a prime example of the genre. The room was lovely and luxurious, with stucco moldings in the ceiling, big comfortable bed with very smooth linens, large LCD TV, and a wonderful bathroom, with a big white marble shower cabin. The breakfast was excellent, with a big variety of spanish smoked hams, cheeses and delicious pastries. The bread was superb. You could order a variety of hot dishes, omelets and vegetables. At 30 Euros it's a bit expensive, so beware as it is not included. The spa was small but effective. A 40 room hotel would hardly have use for a big spa, and the small pool was the ideal for relaxing after a long saturday afternoon museum and shopping spree. Massages were unavailable, as the therapists were booked for the afternoon. At 190 Euros a night for a standard room, the hotel delivers a fair deal, and I would recommend it.", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan", "Title": "\u201cLuxury at the Hospes\u201d", "Author": "MJJRJ", "ReviewID": "UR13311331", "Content": "The Hospes hotel was a peaceful oasis in Madrid.

The hotel is graded as a five star hotel but as it just opened in Oct'07 it is not fully up and running. So, if you don't mind having the comfort of a 5* hotel but the lack of the facilities you would expect in a 5* hotel then book here before it fully opens and take advantage of the good deals which are available. Be warned, there is no mention on the web or when we checked in that the spa or pool facitlities are not open yet or the bar and restaurant has a limited menu available. We asked for a white wine and were told that sherry was all that was available until we insisted and evenually a - very nice - glass of white wine appeared. Advise you to book a restaurant near by in advance, which hotel staff are happy to do. The rooms are very well decorated and spacious with large walk in marble showers and double sinks. (shower was not very powerful though). Hotel staff very accomodating but felt they were still trying to find their feet and no-one seemed to have the experience or authority you would expect from a five star hotel.
