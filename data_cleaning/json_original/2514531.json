The staff at the hotel are unfriendly and just don't want to be bothered and certainly don't care about any problem you may raise. When you ask if you can leave your luggage somewhere, they tell you to put it in a room down the corridor which is unguarded and where anyone can just walk in and take their time in picking what they want to steal. The staircases are extremely narrow and steep, so if you get a room on the third floor you have to drag your luggae up any way you can.

To get to your room we had to navigate through extremely narrow hallways and stairways. The room itself was extremely tiny, with just enough space for a small 'double' bed (more like a super-single), 2 suitcases and maybe a chihuahua, and that's all. Toilet was even smaller, you won't be able to clean your butt without damaging your elbows. Oh, there was a small TV. Yaay! The sheets were clean, although the bed itself was slanted and did not provide good sleep. Towels changed daily. Window pane and ledges were dirty. In fact, most of the room looked dirty except the bed due to the weird dirty-blue color scheme and the dull yellow lighting.

When we checked in we were not given our keys until the owner had contacted the travel agency that our company had booked with just in case we dedided we wanted to stay the night for free, despite the fact that both the travel company and our company had provided him with payment details many times over the previous week. This meant we had to wait in the tiny small reception whilst he confirmed (for the umteenth time) the payment details with both our company and the travel agents. My collegue then had to change rooms as they had allocated her a room that had clearly been slept in and not cleaned with dirty sheets, rubbish and pill boxes on the floor and dirt all over the bathroom. She was then moved to another room that wasnt much better, this had snails and spiders on the wall and plaster was hanging off the wall. I would like to say that my room was better and that she could share with me, but it wasnt. Not only was there not enough room to swing a london alley cat, as soon as the window was shut in the room it smelt worse than a public toilet. The room smelt strongly of urine so bad that it hit the back of your throat when you breathed. Also the \"clean towels\" were grey, and the sheets had holes in them. Unfortunately... as we had just dropped off our cases and dashed out it was almost eleven oclock when we realised how bad the rooms were. You can live with a spider but i have never known a hotel to have snails on the wall or to smell worse than a public toilet. we then had to call to find somewhere else to stay and luckily was rescued by good old travellodge... this was only 5 mins down the road and for the extra ten pounds was far superior! When leaving the friendly receptionist told us we would have to pay for the room as there was nothing wrong with it.

Really, the only redeeming quality about the Wardonia is it\u2019s location in the lively King\u2019s Cross area, which is not nearly enough. You can really tell the bottom of the barrel establishments such as the Wardonia from the more respectable hotels by the attitude of the staff and management towards the guests. The girls at the reception, who were Russian, were helpful enough. The real problem with the place seems to be with the people who run the place, who I think are Irish. The first shock was the smallness of the room. The room was en suite but you could not open the door to the bathroom properly because the bed was in the way. It was just plain cramped, like living in a closet. The second shock was the bathroom itself which was just tiny and when you took a shower the entire bathroom floor would within minutes become flooded because there was no partition separating the shower area from the rest of the bathroom. It also became quite comical that when I stepped in certain parts of the bathroom floor, simultaneously in other parts water would actually squirt up from the space in between the tiles in the floor, since the adhesive had worn off. The floor needed to be repaired, lol. The hotel was also very noisy. If you stay there, (which I hope you have the good sense not to) you\u2019d better pray that the people in the neighbouring rooms choose to sleep at night, because every activity in one room can be heard by the neighbours because of the thin walls. One day I requested a new soap from the person at the reception (one of the people in management, I think) because the one in my room didn\u2019t look fresh (something that I didn\u2019t say to him). \"But you already have a soap, sir.\" He responded, and he proceeded to start an argument over a 3 by 5 centimetre bar of soap. Obviously the old adage: \"the customer is always right,\" meant nothing to him. Eventually, he gave me a new bar of soap and then he came with me into the room, took the old bar of soap from the bathroom and then he stuck it under my nose and said: \"this bar has definitely not been used.\" I would, needless to say, not recommend the Wardonia to any fellow travellers.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cAlways clean and safe\u201d", "Author": "abc001", "ReviewID": "UR24515117", "Content": "I stay at the Wardonia several times a week while working in London.

We never really heard our next door neighbors, but we did hear people walking around in the room above us. Nothing bad, at all. There is not an elevator at this hotel, that we know of. (-)There is no breakfast available, but there is a small convenient store/post office about a block from the hotel, where we bought fruit and croissants. LOCATION: The hotel is a stone's throw from King's Cross/St. Pancras Station. This means it is very close to the underground and train station where the chunnel arrives/departs . I was told that this area isn't the best neighborhood, but I never really felt threatened or uneasy. The hotel is not \"centrally located,\" but I felt it was near enough to everything we needed to see. Getting to Kensington did take a little while, though. THE ROOM: We were given a small room with a double bed, two towels, and a small TV. The room had a very small bathroom: toilet, sink, shower. We had a very nice, tall, screen-less window, which offered a nice breese when opened. This room might get very hot in the summer, but we were there in September, so it was just fine! There was *just* enough room for the two of us and our two suitcases. This was all we needed, because we were out seeing sights all day, so we were only in our room sleeping at night.

It is quaint, with a small reception area and 24 hour reception. There are no elevators and only narrow stairs in this 3 level building, but that was not an issue for us. The rooms are very small but that was also not an issue for us as we were only sleeping there and didn't require space. The room was impeccably clean, the bed was fantastically comfortable and the shower had lots of pressure and made you not want to get out. We didn't hear any noise during our stay and we were in and out at various times of the day and arriving back late evening/early morning. The only downfall is the shower shares the same floor as the small bathroom so once you have a shower it is tough to get dressed because the floor is soaked, but it is doable. For the cheap price of 55GBP per night for a double bed (no breakfast) it was an amazing deal for London. I will definitely stay again and highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dunkin143", "Title": "\u201cNice place, so cheap for what you get.\u201d", "Author": "dunkin143", "ReviewID": "UR12547998", "Content": "Polite, efficient staff.

I found the staff efficient and polite throughout. The place was spotless. The mattress was really comfortable. The sheets and towels were very well laundered. The multi channel tv worked and the shower and toilet looked brand new, with great water pressure. The location was excellent. What more, could you want ? It is true to say the rooms are compact. They are well designed though and their form follows function. You do not get a suite, bell boys, glass elevators or room service at this hotel. You do not get a restaurant, business centre, swimming pool etc. Which suited me fine as they wernt charging for any of these either. If I was to compare it to a \u00a3300+ a night room Boutique Kensington Hotel, it would come off very badly, being substantially smaller and without the luxuries of room service, mini bars, plasma screens etc but then at a 1/6th of the price, one must make concessions. All in all I would stay there again happily, when my budget dictates. At this price level, clean, safe and functional is all one can expect and it satisfies these criteria and exceeds in some respects.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cSteer clear\u201d", "Author": "Deadmoony", "ReviewID": "UR11978074", "Content": "Didn't actually stay there but went through a hell of trouble when trying to book the room and then cancel it because of some dreadful reviews of it I found on the internet.

However, when people say this room is small... they mean SMALL! I couldnt believe it, the room was so depressing too, the receptionist seemed annoyed that she had customers, i was seriously annoyed that i had to struggle with a heavy case through narrow corridors and steep stairwells. the bed was nearly the entirety of the room and even it wasnt big enough, for a single person it would be fine but for a 'double'...! you are having a laugh! we both teatered on the edge of the bed, ridiculous. there is a tv and a bedside table. the ensuite is very cramped, not only is it tiny but the door is spring loaded so you have to get hit by the door just to sit on the loo, when you sit on the loo you can rest on the sink!! the shower (particularly stupid) is on the same level as the rest of the bathroom so if you have a shower the whole bathroom gets wet... very safe... For the price of \u00a365 for one night i would have rather stayed anywhere else but if you need St.pancras thats where the hotel excells, if you dont need the station - get a travel lodge!", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart, Germany", "Title": "\u201cStrongly recommend - clean and quiet\u201d", "Author": "Aneeshka", "ReviewID": "UR11099629", "Content": "I have very good feelings about this hotel. It's important to read on their website, what you shall expect. It's a low budget hotel, so the expectaions shall be reasonalbe. What I found very important is that it is clean, also bathrooms are very well maintained. (Also it's great that each room has its own bathroom). A very big advantage is location - hotel is 1 minute walk from King's Cross underground station. Although it's a busy place, the street with hotel is quiet and safe. I'm a young girl and safety was important for me - I felt really comfortable walking in the late evening back to hotel. Also staff in reception is very friendly and I felt as a welcomed guess. If I shall think of disadvantages, maybe narrow corridors, stairs and very tiny rooms. My room was actually just a bed and space to walk in to bed ;) So if it is just to spend night, then it's ok, otherwise, could be claustrophobic. But there is TV, which can distract you from thinking how tiny it is ;) One more minus is that walls and ceiling are very thin - so you feel having a group of elephants above you, and I was awoken during night by neighbours who were moving out. But in general I recommend and I think I will sleep there next time I'm in London.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Wardonia Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d637234-Reviews-Wardonia_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$79 - $164*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">46-54 Argyle Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Kings Cross</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">WC1H 8ER</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514531", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e0/39/e0396d5e5374e8e01024090a6e5f49eb4large.jpg"}}
