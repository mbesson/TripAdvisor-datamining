Aunt and I stayed at Pension San Juan for six nights in January 2012. The location can't be beat! Located on fifth avenue between 6th and 8th, with the beach just around the corner. Lovely little hotel and my second time staying at PSJ. Our room was king room that sleeps 3 and had a cute private courtyard. The communal patio/kitchen on third floor overlooks fifth avenue and is great for people watching, relaxing and having a bite to eat. If you want to purchase some food at a local grocery and make breakfast or lunch or have a cup of coffee, then this is a great option. The staff were all very friendly and professional and did an excellent job keeping everything very clean. Beds and pillows were good and our room was fairly large and quiet. Bathroom was clean, functional with a large walkin shower. We also had an outdoor shower in the courtyard/patio that was handy to rinse off after visiting the beach! Would not hesitate to stay here again!", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lillooet, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat people watching and Good value right on fifth ave\u201d", "Author": "colindaco", "ReviewID": "UR59976081", "Content": "After they tore down our favourite place we had to find another. We have tried many other places in Playa, but for $49.00 this place is hard to beat. The rooms have a fridge and air conditioning and there is an upstairs deck that has a fully furnished kitchen. Not that we ever cook there but it is nice to have some plates and utensils in case we pick up a roasted chicken or pizza. Also there is a water cooler on every floor so you can refill your water bottle if need be. Also a coffee pot on the top deck for you coffee hounds.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "xoiesomah", "ReviewID": "UR55419238", "Content": "We stayed at the Pension San Juan because I loved the looks of the outside of the hotel on previous trips. We had the front room on the 3rd floor with domed ceiling. The room was spacious with plenty of storage. We had a king sized bed, a fold down couch with drawers under it, a vanity, large closet with plenty of hangers and shelves, an in wall safe and small fridge. Everything was very clean and in good condition. It was great to sit on the blacony and watch people. The shared kitchen veranda was a nice addition with all the cookware and appliances you needed to make a snack or simple meal. The staff were helpful although there was a bit of language barrier as we speak very little spanish, but eventually we understood and found what we were looking for. The only negative was night noise. Our first three nights it was not a problem, but Saturday night even ear plugs did not help.

First major positive point is the price in regards to the location. 5th avenue, close to the bus station/a lot of conveniences/restaurants... well the 5th well known action :) For those who want a very quiet place though, this might not be the best spot as the 5th is very noisy, even during night time. Service was great, the staff was very helpful and polite. The little terasse with the kitchen was very convenient and it gave us the opportunity to enjoy a drink so close to the 5th it gives you the feeling you are in any of the other bars on the street but right next to your room in your hotel. Our room was comfortable. Only negative point is probably the bathroom where we lacked some water pressure for the toilet... But the room in regards to the price we paid was very comfortable. I would also like to underline the honnesty of the people working at the Pension. We had no problems regarding prices/fees. During our stay, we had an emergency and have been forced to leave our room before the established leaving date. Everything was already paid and the staff agreed to refund our nights there which was our own fault. I strongly recommend Pension San Juan for a nice stay/trip in Playa!", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGet another hotel, if possible\u201d", "Author": "sptl", "ReviewID": "UR15645302", "Content": "First of all, making the reservation gave us quite a lot of trouble. We were a group of 8 and we got 4 rooms, each very different from the other. All the rooms were very small, very small bathrooms as well.

We opted for a premium room (~$60/night) and stayed in room C5. This could be considered either the best room or worst room in the hotel. Postives: large room, king sized bed, neat domed ceiling, decent bathroom, balcony with chairs for people watching (only room that has this), close to the kitchen. Negatives: directly across from El Pica Pica bar which plays mostly bad disco music until 2am and has a very obnoxious street hawker trying to lure unsuspecting tourists inside, next to Bourbon Street bar, which has live bands almost everynight (but generally good blues), and next to the kitchen, where people are up cooking breakfast at 7:30am. If you are a light sleeper, this is not a good room. Some of the other rooms near the back are probably quieter at night. The \"free\" coffee offered is instant coffee, and not very good, but there is a Starbucks 2 blocks to the north, and 7-11 1 block to the south. Our room had a safe, but it was non-functional. The overhead light burned out, oh well. Location is great as the beach is one block away, and there are dozens of bars and restaurants within a few blocks. El Fogon Restaurant (calle 8 north and 30th avenue) has excellent reasonable authentic Mexican food. Alux restaurant/bar is an underground cenote/cave, and is definitely worth the $5 cab fair to go for a drink (opens at 6pm). Our best meal was probably at Babe's Noodle bar (calle 10 just west of 5th), which has good Thai food and seafood. Watch your stuff! I had my nice digital camera stolen out of a zippered pocket on my backpack while I was walking down the street in broad daylight a block from the police station. Definitely a professional pick-pocket. Overall, a really nice hotel, and you can't beat the weather (80s and sunny everyday), cold beers, and tequila!", "Date": "February 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mexico", "Title": "\u201cnice and cozy\u201d", "Author": "alits", "ReviewID": "UR7543070", "Content": "It\u00b4s a nice hotel, .

I found Pension San Juan on the web and was attracted by its prices (US$35 and up/night per room) and its claim of being right at the main street. They were right about that! The hotel is centrally located at Quinta Avenida (Fifth Ave.), one block off the beach! I stayed with my wife, 2 children (9 and 10) and their nanny (20). Since we needed at least 4 beds, we had to take their biggest room which faced the boulevard. The room has a view of the street and people watching will entertain you for hours, as thousands and thousands of people start walking up and down Quinta Ave at about noon and don't go home until past 3 AM! We had literally hundreds of restaurants accesible within a 2-3 minute walk. No car is needed or recommended, since you cannot park in or near the busy streets leading to the main street. Service was great and friendly and the rooms were clean. The AC was C-O-L-D and there is a mid-size fridge and a full sink. There is hot water, which you do not need because tap water is not that cold and we needed the cool water on our backs after 6-8 hours at the beach or after the day-long tours in 90 degree weather. Beds were double or queen, and very comfortable. There was a TV with cable, but all channels but CNN were in Spanish, so the kids will have to watch Dora the Explorer in her original language (how kool is that!) There is a full kitchen (sanz microwave) up in a nice balcony facing the boulevard on the third floor where you can cook and sit while looking down at the people walking below. If you are a light sleeper, take a room on the back side of the hotel; otherwise, be prepared to be awakened by singing flocks of \"happy\" locals and visitors roaming the streets until wee hours of dawn. But this should not be an issue the rest of the year. You HAVE to have breakfast at the HOT restaurant about 5 blocks away; ask the desk person at the Pension. Tour buses will pick you up right at the Pension doorsteps and they can give you names of reputable guides. Must see: Chichen Itza Mayan ruins, TULUM ruins and XCARET water park with its underground river. There you can swim with dolphins for 45 minutes but must call ahead and pay US $115/person. The exchange rate was around 10.50-11.10 Mexican pesos for a dollar and everyone will take dollars....plenty of banks and ATM's around. Do not waste money on overpriced Cuban cigars; go to the cigar shop kitty kat corner from the Pension, and ask for Don Mario; he is there every night \"torciendo\" (rolling) cigars and you can get a freshly made Mexican cigar (just as good or better than a Cuban; trust me, I know, I used to sell Cigars) for US $2-5 or buy a box of Veracruz-tobacco cigars to take home withour the hassle of US Customs papework for Cuban cigars. Speaking of Cuban, treat yourself to Mojitos and the best food south of Havana by having dinner at La Bodeguita del Medio, an official Cuban-government owned restaurant which E. Hemingway made famous on his books, and has several franchises in Mexico. Stay for salsa dancing after 9 PM at La Bodeguita; they have their own Cuban salseros! If the ropa vieja, moros y cristianos and the other cuban plates make you tired,, go for a capuccino a couple of doors down. You will also find sushi, stores and others in a very modern strip mall right past the Ferry piers, about a mile from the Pension. Bottom line: if you are looking for anything above 2 stars, look elsewhere...but if you want to have basic accomodations and save a bundle while spending all day at the beach and coming to a comfy room with AC and nice beds for less than $50-80 per night, then this is your place. Overall, an awesome experience.
