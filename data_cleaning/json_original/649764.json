As for the frontdesk clerk, he was merely laconic.There were snack vending machines right next to the elevator. The room was better than expected. My room had a wonderful view of the coast and a little balcony. Coffemaker, coffee, fridge, mugs, glasses were clean as was the bathroom. I cannot say the same for the beds, as one of them looked like it had not been changed into clean sheets, it smelled a little too; the other bed was fine.

We travel to Puerto Rico pretty regularly, and normally stay closer to Old San Juan/metropolitan area, but we were going to a wedding in Camuy, and it was just more convenient to be close by the nights before and of the event. It was a fantastic hotel for the price - we had a fridge (NOT a minibar, an actual regular little fridge), which was great to have some cold beer available in the room for downtime and getting ready. There was also a microwave which was super handy when we wanted a light midnight snack of popcorn the night before the wedding :) The desk staff we encountered were all very friendly, super helpful and spoke both Spanish and English fluently and happily. Folks who wrote negative comments in their reviews regarding the fast food joints and the graffitied adjacent building...sounds like either a bit snobbish or just not too familiar with the island. When you're on a main strip, the abundance of fast food places is everywhere, and once you skip a few blocks down to the beach, you never even know they are there. Our room had an ocean view, and I personally thought the graffitied building off to the right added a bit of character. Bottom line, for the great service, comfort, cleanliness and convenience of the room and the very reasonable price, I'd definitely stay here again if I needed to be in this vicinity of the island. On a past trip we visited the caverns with our at the time 3 year old daughter, and I definitely would have grabbed a night in this hotel for convenience sake rather than trooping back and forth in one day in the car with a little kid.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton, California", "Title": "\u201cBeware of Noisy Banquet Hall and Unsympathetic Staff\u201d", "Author": "Phds2", "ReviewID": "UR123356438", "Content": "We stayed here in December for two nights.

However, the main problem with this hotel is the fourth restaurant/banquet hall which is frequently used for parties. If you are any of the floors on that side of the hotel, you will not be able to sleep a wink. We saw a guy in the elevator bringing up mega speakers that afternoon. From 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., the music was so loud that our walls shook. Earplugs do not work here! We were on the third floor and party hearty revellers were even in the stairwell and down the halls, adding to the noise. The hotel's priorities are clearly with renting out their banquet hall rather than to their overnight guests.
