Not only that, since we had to start shuttling out at 3:30 and check-in time was 3:00, she asked Sarah to call us Monday morning to find out which rooms were in our wedding party so that those would be cleaned first, allowing us to check in by 2 o'clock and ease the time crunch.

Afternoon shuttle driver was extremely friendly and informative. Check-in at 4pm included two women at the front desk (maybe one was learning?). They seemed more concerned with themselves then pleasing us. When asked what time breakfast was, the one gal pointed to three carafe's and said coffee was in the morning. I asked (as well as another customer who came in after us) what about the waffles/juice/etc they still were advertising on their website (one of the draws for us to stay there) and she said that stopped two weeks prior. She seemed put off that I didn't \"understand\" that things change; that's the way it is! And besides, the hotel no longer says it has breakfast (I pointed out that the website still advertises it and the manager should at least be aware of it and please let him know). Several customers complained and we felt we should have received a break in the fee we paid to stay there based on that broken promise. Got to room, and it was dirty. We were a family of four traveling with another family of two. They gave the bigger room to the family of two (go figure). Toilet stopped up and heater wouldn't put out heat. Maintenance came (front staff seemed annoyed that we had to ask to have our heater fixed!) to fix the heater. The toilet still had issues. The next morning we chose not to have our room cleaned and took towels to front office to change them out (we did this on our previous stay here). The annoyed morning guy let us know he can't do that. We asked how to get clean towels. He said to contact housekeeping. I asked if he could do that (he apparently was on his phone with someone and hung up the cell phone to contact housekeeping). House keeping came to our room immediately with a smile on her face (what a concept!). We encountered the male desk clerk once more with his same non-chalant attitude. We asked to speak with manager. He said the manager was off for the weekend and gave us his card. Another employee told us not to waste our breath as the currently manager was not easy to work for and was more concerned making cut-backs than to please customers. I have to admit, our last stay here was wonderful, nothing like this time. Rooms are older and quite small for more than two people, and some upgrading has been done.

(3) Mattress was encased in crinkly plastic - OK once I got to sleep. And the sheets were too small... (4) Parking in the central courtyard was an EXTRA $14 per day. On the plus side, we paid only $73 including tax and parking, which is very, very cheap for San Diego.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cSlated for demolition\u201d", "Author": "chloeandjake", "ReviewID": "UR11411593", "Content": "Here's the deal on this Rodeway Inn...it's either owned or managed by the people across the street...Holiday Inn Express, which used to be Comfort Inn. One of the front desk people tell us it is slated to be demolished next year and a Hyatt put in its place, so don't expect any great improvements. We booked it as the Comfort Inn...how we got the Rodeway Inn is still a mystery to me. Shame on the San Diego tourism website for selling this room as Comfort Inn. We paid $126/night. As other reviewers described, early check-in not possible, but they were very accomodating storing the luggage so we could get out and about. We were told room would be ready \"well before 3\" but it wasn't. Someone from Holiday Inn Express must \"inspect\" room prior to our check-in. Here's what the inspector missed: 1. Non working light next to bed. Tried to fix this ourselves, discovering a USED condom behind the nightstand (really nice, huh?) Turned out a circuit breaker had been tripped and maintenance fixed it. \"Inspector\" never checked lights. 2. Non working safe. By the time it could be fixed, we were checking out. DO remember the $2 charge per night if you use the safe. Sure could have used it, but alas, the inspector \"missed it.\" 3. Don't expect a bathtub. You get a shower pan about 42\" long with a faucet like a tub. Prepare to be cramped. Ask about this before you check in. 4. Don't expect windows to properly close (sort of negates California's idea of being a \"green\" state when most of the a/c cooled air goes right out the window. Fortunately, we were on the third floor and didn't have to worry about someone climbing through the non-closing window. 5. Expect an odor to the non-smoking room...STALE would be a good description. 6. Worry about the elevator inspection certificate that indicated the elevator was long overdue for inspection. This has probably been fixed by now but it was not a \"comfort\" to see an expired inspection certificate. On the plus side: 1. Expect a decent breakfast...the lady tending the food area was very efficient and kept up with the mess left by many people. Enjoy the free USA today. 2. Enjoy Jose, the gentlemen at the front desk who tried to answer any questions we asked and was apologetic about the delay getting into our room. 3. Enjoy the complimentary airport transportation (taxi drivers can charge as much as $12. to go to the airport.) Budget hotel?

The hotel is acceptable, generally speaking. The rooms were, for the most part, clean. However, the bedding/pillow cases smelled musty of cigarette smoke, and I had a non-smoking room. I guess people smoke in these non-smoking rooms? The room was very spacious and quiet, which was nice. I did not feel cramped at all. The bed was a queen sized bed and it was comfortable. The TV was a 24 or 26 inch model, with lots of channels. Bathroom was clean, no bad surprises there. Room had an ironing board, iron, in-room coffee/tea maker, which was handy. Some upgrading is in order, for example, fixing the windows, which don't close properly, getting new rugs in the rooms, new lamps, etc. But this is a hotel for budget-minded people such as myself, so I guess they will get extra-mileage out of the furniture and fixtures, for sure. I used the free/complimentary transportation from and to the airport , which was handy and service was prompt. Also, the complimentary/free breakfast in the morning was nice. You had a good selection to choose from, ie., fruit, cereal, coffee/tea, juices, water, waffles, toast, bagels, etc. It was clean in the breakfast room and the food was good. (No eggs, bacon, sausage or things like that were there). Overall, the place is okay for the budget traveller. Nothing really bad to say and I would recommend it on that premise alone, for the traveller who doesn't want to spend big bucks on a room. The place is basic, simple and nothing splashy. And it is in a nice area, just directly north of downtown, and just south of the Zoo and Balboa Park. Very ideal location. The staff at the Rodeway Inn were not that friendly, they looked bored in their jobs, they weren't friendly as such. No smiles or hello from them, but that is unimportant, since you only have to deal with them for a few minutes on check in/out. The guy driving the courtesy bus to the airport was extra surly. Last note... this hotel charges you for the use of the inroom safe, which is automatically calculated on your hotel bill when you check in. If you don't use it, let them know when you check out and they will deduct the daily $2.00 charge from your bill !

Free parking.). The facility itself is in serious need of renovation. Our first floor, one queen bed, room needed new carpet, new floor in the bathroom, new furniture, new windows, new shower (no tub in our room) and new lights. Mattress was so-so.

The best feature of this hotel is its proximity to the 6th Ave Bistro (6th Ave and B Street). Great place! Too bad the owner of the Bistro does not operate a hotel. I did discover two of San Diego's 'dirty little secrets' while we were there. First was the large number of vagrants/homeless/demented persons that we encountered on the streets of the downtown area and vicinity. I don't know if any of these persons are 'dangerous', but it did make for some unusual sights and smells while walking downtown. Second was the relationship of the airport to many of the near-northside hotels. The airport seems to have one runway, and the near-northside hotels are always in either the landing or takeoff pattern from the airport. Fortunately there seems to be a noise ordinance and planes do not seem to operate between 11:00PM and 6:30AM. But flights begin promptly at 6:30AM.

The hotel is only five blocks from the trolley stop on Fifth Ave & C Street, and another five to ten minute walk to the Gaslamp district. The walk back to the hotel is up a couple of steep hills and in the evening the area can be deserted and on some blocks, a bit scary. The parking was free for the two nights we had a rental car.

After winding our way from the drop off point in the basement garage to the elevators in the poorly lit area, we found the lobby of the sister hotel. The woman at the desk told us to walk down the stairs outside the lobby and cross the street. That was not fun carrying luggage. At the Comfort we entered the office only to be met with a young woman sitting behind the desk,who failed to say any to us until we said that we had a reservation. We had used the Comfort internet site to make the reservation; requesting an upper floor facing north or east. The woman at the desk gave us a ground floor room facing the south. At that time I knew we were in a strange hotel. The room itself was o.k.; but not worth the amount paid. The first night I went to set the alarm clock on the side table only to find it broken. It was 10 o'clock at night and since our room was near the office, I took the clock over to see if I could get a replacement. The man at the desk wasn't able to replace it but he quickly offered to set the phone system to give us a wake up call at 6 o'clock and another call three minutes after that. Nice. The following morning I checked at the desk to see if a clock radio was available only to encounter the young lady who was at the desk the previous morning. There she sat staring blindly until I asked her about the clock. Once again it was a big effort for her to reach under the counter and hand me the clock. What a creep. When we check out of the hotel, another man was at the desk and asked us how our stay was. Well I told him about the shuttle and and clock incidents. He was appalled. He asked if we need the shuttle to get to the airport and I told him I didn't want to take a chance with that again but that we wanted to leave our luggage at the hotel for a few hours as we were going to have lunch in San Diego before our flight. He was very happy to do it. A few hours later when we came to claim our luggage, yet another man was behind the desk and once again we told him of our stay after his inquiry of our visit.
