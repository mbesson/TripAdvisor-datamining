The motel is not new and is not a premiere resort property by any stretch of the imagination.

I can only imagine trying to maintain carpets, bedding, and bathrooms in an environment with sand, salt, and humidity is a big task. The staff here does a great job in maintaining the rooms in an acceptable state. The staff were all very friendly. From the time we checked in until we departed we were greeted by staff members anytime we saw them. This included the desk staff, housekeeping, and maintenance personnel. Each and every one of them extended a greeting and a few words in passing. There were minor cosmetic issues with the room, but at this price and with a property of this age that can be expected. All in all, we got a suite with two double beds, a sleep sofa, and kitchenette for a very reasonable price within easy walking distance to the beach. The biggest complaint was the mattresses. They were very soft and offered little support. We did not get the best nights sleep for the two nights we were there.

Five floors, located right on the ocean side of the Coastal Highway, and only two short blocks to walk to the beach. With five of us, it's hard to find enough space in a regular hotel room and all other suites are way over-priced. You get two decent sized rooms -- one \"living area\" with sleeper sofa, table/chairs, flat-screen TV, DVD player, kitchenette w/fridge & m-wave, nice-sized bathroom with good shower with nice hot water (actually maybe too hot for little kids!) and hair dryer, and separate bedroom (with door you can close) with two double beds or one king bed (this room faces the highway and you'll hear highway noise) with TV and DVD player. Always a fantastic value and clean (most importantly, NO BED BUGS!). Indoor, heated pool is small but adequate. Nice extras are that they give you two beach towels and two beach chairs per room -- this saves packing chairs and towels and is a plus! The front desk has DVD's you can sign out and watch for free (not a huge selection, but nice for the kids). Our only complaint this time, which is a first, was that the housekeeping staff was not as good as in year's past -- and that our housekeeper actually wrote \"tips, please\" on her tip envelope.... we know what the envelope is for and we don't need to be asked for a tip... I was disappointed in this and found it to be quite rude.

Although the staff was very helpful and friendly, every piece of furniture in the room was extremely uncomfortable. The couch, the pull out bed, the chairs... all fairly hard and uncomfortable. The king size bed in the bedroom was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on in all of my travels. It was hard as a board and extremely unforgiving on my middle-aged body. I tossed and turned all night, every night, and got up in the morning with pain in my back, neck, hips and legs. Additionally, the sheets were very thin and uncomfortable- they felt like a cotton/poly blend- yuck! The toilet also gave us problems- it was loose on one side, and everytime we slightly leaned, the toliet came up off the floor like it was going to fall over. The toilet also took a long time to refill after flushing. The balcony was nice, but located directly facing coastal highway and the brutal afternoon sun rendered it unusable. On the plus side, we could see 4th of July fireworks from our front door. We purchased a 5 night package, but we checked out after 4 nights because my back just couldn't take another night in that bed. We did not get a refund for the unused night, but we didn't ask, either. We got home today, and my back hurts whenever I move. My young son was looking forward to the gameroom, but it was filled with 20 year old rusty games that cost .50 per game. They even had an old, rusty PacMan game!

The indoor pool was well kept although a little small so I was glad we were here on a slow weekend. I don't have any major complaints just a few hiccups that were resolved, like there was only one DVD player in the room, when we asked for another one the front desk clerk first told us we would have to wait to see what was available the next day, This was a little confusing since there were only a few other cars in the lot so no way could they be near capacity but I guess after some second thought the clerk decided to call Tom at home and make sure that is was okay to loan us a DVD player from another room (which he okayed) and the DVD player was brought to the room within the next hour. The other small issue was that on our way to the beach we grabbed four beach chairs and the clerk informed us adamantly that the rules are only two beach chairs per room.

We were originally booked to the 25th but found ourselves on our first visit to Ocean City during natural disaster week and we were chased out by the hurricane. We did get to experience the earthquake though\u2026our first! I mean this is a tongue-in-cheek way because seasoned travelers know that events can be planned but not outcomes. It is worth noting that this is a great time of year to visit this area because the rates are reduced and the weather is warm with plenty of vacationers still about. Finding affordable accommodations in Ocean City can be a challenge but this little gem of a place makes it an easy choice. We took advantage of one of their vacation packages which can be found on their website and provided us with a free night in addition to rates which were all ready running some 30 to 50 percent below the average. Cayman also provides an attractive beach bag, bucket of tasty caramel popcorn and a kite with the package as welcoming gifts. There is probably no better place to fly a kite than on the beach, so if you stink at it, now is your chance! Located some 100 blocks north of the boardwalk we were concerned about the location but after acclimating to the area we realized that this was perfect for us. With three of us, including mom, this stretch of strand is a little more on the quiet side, which we like. The drive down to the boardwalk is a snap with ample parking there and you get to see what businesses and attractions that you might like to visit on the way there. An affordable bus line can be accessed outside the front of the hotel if you are so inclined. In addition, a lovely park is located right across the street as well as a beachwear store, a few restaurants and ice cream shops including OC\u2019s beloved Dumser\u2019s. A pizza carry-out and a liquor store is also nearby which can come in handy when adult children vacation with their mom. The Hotel is also a hop and a skip from the Delaware border which affords a lovely and easy 20 minute drive up to Rehoboth Beach with it\u2019s artisan community of lazy tree-lined streets, upscale shopping district and boardwalk. Beach access from the Cayman is short, safe and simple and with OC\u2019s spacious sandy expanses three are no complications with overcrowding. A life guard was also stationed there. The hotel itself is bright and cheery, well maintained and clean. All appliances worked fine as did the shower, sinks etc\u2026 A street view balcony affords a repose for some people watching while the room entrance faces the sea and other properties. The area itself is laid back and put us in mind of North Myrtle Beach or any of those places where one stays in the U.S. in the beach condo district. Cayman has one indoor pool which can be viewed by the front-desk clerk. The kids seemed to be having a great time in it and it was almost always busy as Mid-Atlantic Oceans have cool waters. There was always someone at the desk who often greeted us as we would come and go. The place sports a rather nice arcade and fitness room. Vending and an ice machine were located on the floor below us and were in good working order. As stated earlier we prudently left a day early prior to evacuation due to the onset of Hurricane Irene as we did not want to get caught in heavy traffic on the drive back to Pittsburgh.

The suites are a nice size and include a small kitchen w/ a microwave, refrigerator, small stove. There is also a separate bedroom, which we really like. However, the suite was not clean AT ALL, esp. the bathroom. The floor tile grout was black, there was sand caked in the corners, the shower floor mat was filthy, and the toilet rim (underneath) was visibly dirty. There was a small bottle of complimentary lotion sitting on the bathroom counter the entire time we were there that had a small hair sticking out from under the label. Obviously we had no intention of using that. Also, I would find single strands of dark hair on the side of the shower, on the shower curtain, etc. The kitchen was also not clean (the counter) and the sink didn't drain properly (gross). When we went to move the nightstand or dresser in the bedroom to plug things in, or the TV stand in the main area, we were disgusted by how dirty it was behind them, and when we lifted the bedskirt to look for something, we found pieces of food (cookies?). Even something as simple to fix as the small pad of paper left on the table in the kitchenette was not addressed - the top sheet was dirty & sticky (housekeeping could at least tear that off before the next guests arrive). We found an open bag of Q-tips sitting on the tray on the kitchenette table. Definite lack of attention to detail. The worst part of this experience was the owner's attitude when our concerns were brought to her attention. She had a \"smug\" attitude and was not willing to offer anything to pacify a clearly unhappy customer. I was told that I should have brought this to their attention sooner and that changes to reservations are only allowed 5 days in advance (we asked to check-out a day early & to receive our money back for the 3rd night we weren't going to use). I was told: \"leave whenever you want to, but there would be no refund for the last night.\" Of course, one would never know until they actually arrive (certainly not 5 days in advance) that the property is not all that it is cracked up to be on their website. Pictures can be deceiving. Take it from someone who's seen it in person. The property is definitely in need of an overhaul (and a thorough cleaning).

There were 3 bikes, all not working1 seat cannot be adjusted, 1 the pedal fell off and 1 did not pedal at all. Oh, the treadmill worked, but first I needed to get the 'key' from the front desk.

The walls are a little thin but lets be honest nothing much the staff can do about that. Once entering the room, I was in the living area which has great amount of space.

My family arrived here on August 19, and spent two nights and three days for a end of the season beach getaway. First off if you want quick access to the boardwalk, this is not the place for you. The boardwalk is about a mile away. That being said it\u2019s a mixed blessing. The closer to the boards, the higher the rates. More noise. More traffic. The boardwalk and for that matter all of the main strip of Ocean City is easily accessible by a clean safe bus service that runs all day and well into the night for $2.00 all day access. Definitely the way to go. The beach however is just one block up. The hotel provides two free beach chairs and an umbrella. It was very easy to set up first thing in the morning, come back and forth for bathroom trips or for lunch. The four of us stayed in a king suite which had a separate bedroom for the king and a twin pullout sofa in the living area. A small fridge, microwave and two burner stove top as well as silverware, cookware and dishes are supplied. The hotel also has a small heated indoor pool which we didn\u2019t get a chance to use. The room was neat and clean, but was starting to show some age. Also the walls in the living area are thin. We fortunately had neighbors that were respectful of this fact but I could see where this may become an issue. The one thing that makes this hotel stand out was the staff. From the folks at the front desk to housekeeping, everyone had a friendly hello and were more than willing to help. All in all it was a good value for the price. We were near to the beach and in a nice part of town. No complaints, just a nice place to stay. The Good - Price was reasonable Room was clean and well appointed Beach just one block away with no streets to cross Many restaurants, food and beach supply stores within walking distance Service was above average Free use of beach chairs and umbrella The Bad - Far from boardwalk Thin walls Clean room but starting to show some age", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGood room...Bad attitudes\u201d", "Author": "well-traveled32", "ReviewID": "UR18818921", "Content": "I had read some undesirable reviews about the Cayman Suites but decided to go ahead and stay there anyway. From the moment we got there, we were greeted with bad attitudes from the people at the front desk. We had asked if we could possible check-in to our room some time before the 3 o'clock check-in time (which we have done at every other hotel we've stayed at in OC, MD) and the front desk clerk insisted that was not an option. He insisted that it took till that time for all the rooms to be ready. He also went as far as to say that other hotels are starting to have check-in times as late as 4 or 5 (guess this was his way of saying 3 was good). He just rubbed us the wrong way. So we said fine and went to the beach for a couple of hours. We came back at 3 to check-in and there was a long line at the front desk. Many people were commenting on how rude the front desk personnel were and couldn't understand why they couldn't have been let into their rooms 10 to 15 minutes early to avoid the crush of people checking in. I guess in their minds dealing with a big crowd of frustrated people is better than letting people in a little early than 3. So that was that, as for the room, it was fine. It was quite spacious, but very outdated. It was clean enough, but there was mold in the shower. Mold can be quite unhealthy and it just doesn't give you the feeling that the place is well attended to. A simple bleach solution would probably remedy it. All in all, we had a great time, but wouldn't ever stay at this place again nor would we recommend it to anyone.

The best thing about staying at the Cayman Suites over the fourth of July is that you have a front row seat for the fireworks just across Coastal Highway at the park. This year the fireworks were cancelled due to weather conditions, however we were not let down. On July 5th we witness a spectacular display from our balcony. No driving, No bus riding, No setting in the rain waiting for the fireworks, just walk out on your balcony and your ready for the show!!!! Also, if you have children, on July 4th at the park(just right across coastal highway) they have games for the children, entertainment, and a great playground. The Cayman Suites is your usual hotel.
