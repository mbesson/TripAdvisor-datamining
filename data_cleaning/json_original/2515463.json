The resort is set up as a series of small buildings that have two units each. It appears that some of these units have full-time residents and others are used as a hotel. As such, there is an odd vibe of full-time residents and vistors in the complex; this is not a bad thing, just a bit differnt from the usual hotel. The resort tries to give an exotic feel to the location by making it a walking experience, with staff in golf carts always willing to lend someone a ride. However there is very bad signage, and it is easy to get lost; half the time I flagged down a staff member on a cart was to get directions. Geting lost due to a lack fo signage, especially at night with limited street illumination got tiresome quickly. The rooms themselves have an \"island like\" flavor with hardwood floor, however due to the first level location, I did have some ants in my room, which was a bit unwelcomed. There is a casual and a more formal restaurant in the complex. While I only ate at the casual restaurant, it was not very good. Overall I felt that the resort was lacking something; it seemed like it did not know what it wanted to be, and as a result, it did all things a bit badly.

Found a not bad discount price for Paradise Point, and the website pictures and description sold us. I came here with quite high expectations. We stayed for 8 days. We stayed in a \u201cJunior Garden Suite\u201d which is a large room with a king bed and a fold-out queen sofa bed. A small kitchenette is at the end, with a fridge and microwave only. A large bathroom with two sinks, a separate room with toilet, tub/shower, and a separate walk-in closet with a dresser and coat rack make up the balance of the room. We had a nice patio looking out over a small pond with ducks, and a view of the ocean lagoon between two adjacent buildings. The room was very clean. The beds were not that good. The king squeaked and rocked every time someone moved. The sofa bed was likewise noisy. The room climate control worked well, but was too loud to leave running over night (when the compressor kicked in it was like sitting next to a large diesel truck). The resort grounds are very nice, a small army of landscapers are working non-stop to clean up palm branches and the like. There was never plant debris on the paved paths. Lots of flowers and trees make up the very nice grounds. Likewise, there is a ton of beach space although it is not really swimming worthy. The resort is surrounded by an ocean lagoon, and the shallows are weedy and green. Lots of sand for digging, suggests this would be a great place for young families looking for quiet beach time. The rooms are average, and the place is showing its age. I spotted a number of rotted lintels or California roofs on rooms, and there was lots of wood in need of fresh paint. I know this humid climate is tough on wood. We were shocked when we finally figured out that the deep blue colour of the pond water is because it has been dyed that colour\u2026along with the feet of many of the ducks (a real surprise for California). The staff were all wonderful and eager to help. I did get a bit tired at the excessive apologizing when I complained, but maybe that is a US thing. One apology is good, then do something to fix the problem \u2013 apologizing six times and doing nothing is just frustrating. Nevertheless, everyone I encountered was eager to help out. We ate several meals at the Barefoot bar and grill, and found the food quality quite good if a bit pricey. The service was very good. I have some criticisms, which may seem picky at first. Considering we\u2019re paying something like US$250 per night, I didn\u2019t think my expectations were unreasonable. I\u2019ve stayed at much cheaper places that had much better facilities. The facility charges an added $17 per night which is intended to remove the incremental charges for recreation, well, for some recreation. One benefit is internet access. Problem 1: after 45 minutes on the phone with their tech support people, I still could not get wireless access in our room. When I complained I was told I could get wireless in the lobby, and they gave us a $30 credit. 2: after being out all day (8 am to 8 pm) we returned to find housekeeping had not been through our room. I phoned for extra towels, which were brought by in 30 min. When I asked the next day that housekeeping please stop in as they had missed us, I got multiple apologies but that was it. 3: Looking to print out boarding passes on our departure, I discovered that the only guest printer requires a credit card swipe, with $5 charge for 5 minutes internet plus $1 per page printed. That last one really got me, as I can\u2019t recall ever being in a place that charged for internet use and printing. 4: (a small one) housekeeping made up our room and threw out the one bar of soap without replacing it. 5: I did not check to see if the power was on, but found an exposed outlet and in a different location a light fixture in the gardens with bare wires exposed just adjacent to the path. 6: one day we rented bikes for 4 hours to take a trip down the ocean-side. Cost was $12 per hour ($36 for 4 hours). I was surprised to find similar bikes for rent along the beach for $16 for 4 hours, which reflects the overall high price of everything on the resort. 7: The water taxi to Sea World is a great bonus (for a $9 round-trip ticket), but you need to have pre-purchased tickets for Sea World (we didn\u2019t but had San Diego Go Cards which got us full admission). After being told that was fine at the store the night before, a rather patronizing ex-pat brit boat captain the next morning said we might have problems. He then apologized profusely to the Sea World person that met us while we were standing next to him, leaving us feeling rather embarrassed. They should get their story straight and remember that the customers are the ones riding on the boat, not the Sea World staffer. We made the decision to not rent a car, which was our mistake (trying to really get away from it all). You are very captive to the resort. Public transit passes by every 20 minutes or so (except on Sundays), with the alternate being a cab ride into Old Town for about $20. If we had a car we would have purchased most of our daily use supplies (drinks & snacks) at a local grocery and saved over the much higher costs at the local Island Market (like $12 for a six-pack of Bud). If we returned I would either opt for a downtown hotel, or rent a car for the whole period. A rental car would allow for accessing cheaper activities like bike rentals off-site. Public transit worked well, and we met some really neat locals while riding. Overall I would rate the place as average, but would consider staying here again (with some better preparation, like renting a car). If I did it would be with downgraded expectations, that would not set me up for such disappointment.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muscatine, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cGreat family place\u201d", "Author": "53reba", "ReviewID": "UR127065672", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from a week at Paradise Point Resort.

We had a room on the bay and it was very calm and not very windy so it was nice to sit out and enjoy the sun. One afternoon we had lunch at the bare foot restaurant out side, they had heaters to keep you warm which was nice. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad ($15ish) and it was awful, tasted like instead of making a dressing they just used straight mayo. Sick! My husband ordered a burger which is hard to mess up and he said it was fine nothing special. The other two couples we were there with were also not impressed with the quality of their meals in comparison to the cost. When our bill came, we asked our waiter to split it between the three couples, and he then asked us to total up our own bills and just give him cards to charge. Sorry but isn't that HIS job? Overall for expectation of high quality, fine dining at the resort you would think that they would make sure to hire ONLY the most competent people to assist their guests. That was very clearly not the case. In the gift shop there were people all over the store and a huge line of people to pay for items and only ONE person checking them out.... Since when is standing around your most important job? You are in the service industry. The gentleman who was in charge of the bike rentals was very friendly and helpful and actually seemed to have knowledge about his job. Refreshing. One day we decided to take the water taxi over to sea world which was great, and a fun way to arrive at the park. Only downside to that is that if you want to use the shuttle to come back it only comes back at 5 &6 pm, so you have to be there all day. Which was fine, but it would have been nice to use it to come back earlier.

I have to admit like others after reading some of the negative comments that I was unsure about my choice BUT please remember everybody has different opinions! I have to say I was mesmerized as we drove onto the grounds and found such beauty! We were greeted by Ben who was super!! Diego at the front desk was amazing, great comps, again Thank you!!! When we arrived in our room, which were upgraded to, we opened our patio door the the view and had ducks waiting for us (ok I am a sucker for furry friends.) We also had a very nice card and a basket of fruit waiting for us. We enjoyed our first evening by the pool and hot tub, right outside our room. Again amazing! The next day we grabbed our coffee and scones at the coffee shop and again, staff superb! Headed off for a road trip to Joshua Tree..long drive but beautiful, despite the wind and extremely windy road on the way back, but what and adventure! when we got back to our room we had a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of wine waiting for us, courtesy of our daughter and son in-law! Called the front desk for a cork screw, not realizing one was laying on the table...arrived in 2 minutes! Cannot ask for better service. So if you are ever in the area I would highly recommend Paradise Point. The amenities as super and the staff are just as awesome. Yes there is a resort fee of $17 and there is a parking fee of $32 a day, but have you checked out some other places? Our original plans were to go to Vegas, hmmm, can you say resort fees...I will take these fees and get an awesome stay, great beaches, at a very classy resort!!

Knowing that San Diego was our destination, we started looking around for properties to spend our 5 nights and 6 days. To be honest, we also were a bit apprehensive by the negative remarks made by some reviewers, so we looked for a bit at the Hilton by the Bay, and a couple of others. However, after some discussions, we decided to go with our instinct, realizing that there will ALWAYS be unhappy people out there, quick to nit-pick every last detail, and those whose standards are just ridiculously unattainable. THANK GOD we listened to our inner voice. From the moment we turned the corner on Vacation Drive, we knew we had arrived at our home for a week. Pulling up to the valet, we were greeted by the main man, Marc Garner, who quickly became our SD guru of all things. We cannot say enough amazing things about the staff at PP, from the valet, cleaning crew, grounds keepers, room service, spa staff, bar and restaurant crew, and management. The GM of the property has a kind, compassionate group of extraordinary people working for him, who go out of their way to make the guests at this resort feel as if you are the only people they are there to take care of. But we MUST give extra props to our guy Marc..... He's a gem.... We will certainly come back and he is one of the main reasons why. Our bungalow on the beach was a sweet little apartment, very clean, with a immediate beach access and a fire pit steps away. We ended up meeting some incredible people the first night we were there and met up a few more times throughout the week.... A nice community feel if you're up for that, but no pressure if you're not. The grounds themselves made you feel as though you were on an island of a combination of Tahiti, Figi, and Hawaii. Bikes to ride, mini golf to play, multiple pools to swim in, (including an adults-only pool), spa to relax in, bars on the water to let loose, a phenomenal restaurant to dine at, trails to walk, and beachfront to get lost on. And this is all just on the property. Rent a car if you'd like to get our and explore. Head to the San Diego Zoo and be sure NOT to miss Balboa Park. Go to Ocean Beach, Pacific Beach, Mission Bay, Belmont Park, head down to La Jolla and see the seals, then make a reservation at either George's and have the carrot cake for dessert or stop in at Crabcatcher.

We were cramped by big vans and SUV's on both sides of us, and sometimes it was a challenge getting our baby into the carseat. The rooms were smaller than I expected, and we got a free upgrade to the \"Garden View\", which all that meant to me was you get 2 chairs outside to sit and see your neighbors, but there was no view. We stayed 3 nights and after the first night we noticed tiny ants crawling all over the desk, even though the only food we had was in the fridge. So on the 2nd day we told the FD about it and asked if they would also change the lightbulb outside our door as it was burned out and very dark when we arrived at night. We also wanted housekeeping service this day. But when we got back after a very long day at the Zoo, we found ants still all over the desk, and they didn't change our sheets, just remade the bed.

We had a good stay but I just find that it doesn\u2019t deserve the 4* when I compare it to some other 4* properties (I have Westins and Hiltons in mind). The staff at the reception is pleasant, the ladies from housekeeping are adorable but the valet was not so helpful. We were supposed to get a map of the resort from him but we never did, so I\u2019m sure we missed out on a lot of areas of the resort. When you arrive at the resort, you definitely feel somewhere exotic, the landscape is really nicely done. The room. We got room 146 which was garden view\u2026 well it was more of a neighbor\u2019s view. Our bungalow was facing another one and there is not so much space between them so if you keep your curtains open, you can see right inside your neighbor\u2019s bungalow. In order to keep our privacy we had to keep our curtains closed at all times: quite a shame when you come all the way from Canada to see the sun! We could see that the room had been updated, but in a very superficial way: the furniture is nice, the colors are contemporary but when you look closely, the drywall was not updated as it is uneven, the windows are very old and don\u2019t do well with condensation and the worst part was the bathroom. The sink area is ok, with its granite counter but the bathtub/WC area looks as bad as a Motel6 bathroom. The white tiling and grout looks really dated and they put a very cheap shower curtain, the same kind I had in a Motel6. If you want to be a 4*, have glass doors to the tub and nice fixtures\u2026 I did appreciate the soap/shampoo/conditioner dispenser, as it is way more environmental friendly. The towels were horrible: when I go to a 4*, I like to think I will get nice white plush bath towels in which I can just curl up after a bath, well not here. It almost feels like you\u2019re getting a body scrub when you use them! The bed was great, we slept very well, it might be on the firm side, but we didn\u2019t mind. There is a ton of storage if you are going to stay there several days and you have an actual walk-in closet. The mildew smell is very unpleasant at first, but if you turn on the A/C, you\u2019ll forget about it after a while. We did start having runny noses at the end of our stay, so that would be another reason for us not to stay there again. The resort. I can\u2019t say much about the resort itself as we didn\u2019t really hang out there. We went once to the hot tub behind our bungalow. We first wanted to go swim in the pool, but ducks were already swimming in that pool and it kind of grossed us out. The beach seemed ok, but we went to other beaches (Coronado and La Jolla). Food I cannot comment on the resort\u2019s restaurants, as we never had a meal there. What I REALLY DISLIKED were the fees. For 2 nights, we paid $97.78 in fees ON TOP of the room rate. That includes the parking fee of $32 and the resort fee of $17 plus the taxes. I usually never complain about the parking fee, especially in a city center; but here, you\u2019re definitely NOT in a city center and every single room has it\u2019s own parking space right in front of the door. So if the room is empty, that space will not be used by anybody else. I think the parking fee should just be included in the room rate. The resort fee is ridiculous and they probably know it because at check-in, they give you a whole booklet dedicated to justifying the resort fee and what it includes. It includes: internet, phone calls, fitness center, basketball, tennis, ping pong, croquet, horseshoes and bocce ball. It\u2019s probably a great deal when you use everything but we didn\u2019t and would have appreciated the possibility to opt out of this service. All in all I wasn\u2019t that disappointed because I did not have high expectations AND because we only paid $70 for our room through Priceline. It\u2019s maybe worth the $70 + $35 parking + $17 resort fee + tax but I\u2019m not even sure. It\u2019s definitely NOT worth the $200+ official room rate (on top of which you will add the fees). I would not recommend that place but if you really do want to go there, please find some way to get your room cheap and you\u2019ll be less disappointed.

The Paradise Point was what he came up with... boy did he regret it! This place is SUCH a dump! I don't know who rates these hotels, but it was rated as a 5 Star. Well, apparently the Motel 6 has jumped in it's rating as well. If this is a 5 star, then is the Four Seasons a 12 star?? My husband had booked a King room. We have a baby, and luckily I had called ahead to ask about cribs. Well, this \"luxury\" hotel does NOT have cribs, so I brought my own. Thank goodness, because if they did, I can only imagine the condition that it would be in. So when my husband went to check in they told him they \"only had queen rooms available.\" He said, \"I booked a king!\" They said, \"Yeah.. whatever.. we only have queens.\" Disappointed, we headed over to the room. They also charge you a fortune for SELF PARKING right in front of your room. Ridiculous. When we walked in, I could BARELY breathe because it smelled so bad. When I walked into the bathroom, it was covered in mold, and there was a cultured marble counter top, with a plastic toilet and shower. NOT the \"marble\" bathroom pictured and described in the ad. It was so disgusting there was no WAY I would go into that bathroom. And it said \"Walk in closet?\" Perhaps a cockroach could walk in there! Then our room was on the street, as it was advertised as a \"Garden room on a private island.\" Yeah, so private that we could hear the songs people were playing in their cars as they drove by, and their headlights shined into our room. We called and spoke to the manager and demanded to be moved. Meanwhile, I went back out into the car because I couldn't even stand the smell. Suddenly 4 King rooms became available. How did that happen?? So the manager moved us. When we arrived in our new room, it smelled almost as bad, but was so humid I couldn't stand to be in there. Same bad bathroom, and there were dried drips of semen on our brown bed cover. The floor was so dirty I couldn't walk on it, and the bathroom was covered in the same mold, and paint was peeling off of the walls. REALLY?? This is 5 STAR?? I don't think so. It was so disgusting. My husband was mortified because I was so upset and he was trying to do something nice for me. The manager offered to move us again, but I said, \"I'm starving and don't want to waste any more time waiting to be moved to more of the same.\" This had already taken over an hour and a half. They came and cleaned our room to try and make it better. The manager said that he would call us and bring a dehumidifier... he did neither. He did not offer to comp us dinner or anything, only to refund our money and send us back home. After driving 4.5 hours, that wasn't really an option. The grounds are VERY sub par, and when we checked out, the girl seemed totally put out that we received a SLIGHT discount. I couldn't sleep because there was a heater from 1969 that was in the wall and kept turning off and on very loudly. Honestly, the property looks like it was built 50 years ago and hasn't been touched since then. The pools are horrible, and it smells awful. The only thing good I can say about the place is that the restaurant was really good. But seriously, RUN for your lives. This is a 2 STAR property.

It was so peaceful and green with ponds, waterfalls, birds, ducks, and herons everywhere. Flowers bloomed all around. The grounds were beautifully maintained. Our room was perfect, a garden bungalow with a view of the bay and a few steps from the beach. There was a large closet/dressing room for hanging clothes and suitcases. The bathroom was a little older but spotless, had two sinks separate from the shower with plenty of towels that were replenished daily. The bed was a bit hard but there were plenty of pillows.There are two restaurants on the premises but The Barefoot Grill was closed for renovation for most of our time there. That created some confusion at Baleen (the main restaurant) as they were picking up the slack. The staff was fantastic at both places (Barefoot opened the outside patio the last two days) and the food was very good except for lunch our first day. Every staff member we encountered was pleasant, helpful, and courteous, from the wait staff to the groundskeepers. We had a massage at the Spa and it was wonderful. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was airport transportation was included in the package. Our decision not to rent a car, in part because there was an additional daily fee to park, worked great for us. When we wanted to leave the resort we called the front desk and a cab was waiting for us in 10 minutes. There are set rates to many of the usual places one would want to visit, e.g. the zoo, the old city. The only criticism that we have is we wished there was a microwave to warm our morning coffee or re-warm left over food and to have better lighting in the bathroom.

A huge part of our enjoyment was due to the fact that we LOVED our room!!! We had a Bayside Bungalow in Paradise Cove and the room was smack on the sand looking out on the beautiful bay with a fire pit right outside our room for nightly s'more making! The water on the bay was very tranquil, which allowed my husband and I to actually be able to sit on the sand and relax without worrying about our 2 year old running into the waves. It was a dream! The girls had so much fun playing on the beach and we loved that we could put little one down for nap, and we could sit and read on the waterfront patio and watch our oldest on the sand playing on the beach. We also loved that there was so much to do! There were 4 pools that we could use (5 total on the resort - but 1 is adult only). My daughters loved picking a different pool to use each day, and to our surprise they actually liked going to the small ones vs. the big main pool, which was fine by us. All the pools had a graduated entry, so my two year old could wade and splash around, which I loved. This is a truly FAMILY-FRIENDLY resort. One day we rented a surrey bike and cruised around the property, which was a ton of fun, and we just had so much fun exploring the grounds. It is the type of place where once you check in, you don't really have to leave! But the great thing is that if you want to go \"off campus\" for an outing, the location is phenomenal as it is close to a ton of San Diego family attractions. The room itself was amazing. It had a kitchenette, dining table, and separate bedroom, so we could put the girls down to bed early and stay up later without disturbing them. The bathroom was also fabulously designed, as you could shut off the door and be able to use the bathroom without disturbing little ones as well. It was clean and beautifully decorated. Again, the Bayside Bungalows were AMAZING! We drove to the resort so we were able to pack our girls' scooters in the car, which was fun to let them cruise around on. And one night we played a little mini-golf which was close to our room. If you are looking for a family-friendly resort, this property had a ton of activities for all ages.

We were impressed at first, but there were a few surprises and disappointments. The Good: Very pretty grounds with lots to do and 2 restaurants Large rooms Pool and jacuzzi were nice The Bad: *Parking fee (for us it was $32, but I heard another person get charged $27. This was on top of Priceline fee.) *\"Passport\" Fee (this is $15/day per person on top of our Pricelined charges... would have been fine if we had arrived early enough to use the services or if we had just known that was a charge on top of the Priceline fee.) This fee is for using the grounds, like playing tennis/etc. The Annoying: When we arrived, we instantly liked the hotel and decided to ask them if we could stay another night for around the same price that we got on Priceline. We weren't expecting to win a bid on a hotel with so much to do (spa/tennis/ping pong/pools/etc.) so we thought we might like to stay another full day so we could actually enjoy the hotel instead of just sleeping there one night. The woman at the front desk was friendly but said she wouldn't be able to let me know until later that night or when the manager came in the next morning. I didn't hear from them in the morning, so I called the front desk. A different woman told me that she would need to check, but no matter what, she would call me right back. She did not. I finally decided to pack up our stuff and check out. We were disappointed to leave, and wondered why no one ever got back to us. The hotel did not seem very busy, we only saw a handful of people during our stay... an extra night seemed like it would work well for everyone, especially if we kept the same room. Upon check-out I was told that we couldn't have the room another night because there was a conference coming in and all the rooms were taken. I didn't believe this last-minute excuse because if all the rooms were booked, then why didn't they just say that when I first inquired? The woman at the front desk said she was sorry, but whenever I wanted to come back, she would make sure we were taken care of. Sadly, I don't think we'll be going back. It was a cute place and we were excited in the moment about spending the day in the spa and using the Passports for tennis, etc., but we wouldn't go out of our way to return. Tips: Ask for the parking fee to be waived. I just happened to read the reviews on Yelp and a few people mentioned the ridiculous parking fees. A few people said that if you asked about it, they usually would waive the fee for you.

Just finished my stay at PP with my wife. We stayed for 5 nights in a Junior Bayside Suite.

He loaded our bags for us on his golf cart while we went into the lobby to check-in. Check-in complete, we followed Tony in our rental car to our suite on the bay. He put our bags in our room for us and gave us a tour of our outside space as well as inside of our room. Tony's attitude definitely welcomed us to the more relaxed California lifestyle. The room was very nicely decorated and very clean. I feel bad for the reviewers who wrote a bad review because of a spider or a bug, this has nothing to do with the housekeeping, they are not exterminators. Who doesn't have a spider in their personal residence? Give me a break. Room was very clean. Other vacationers do decide that the chairs behind your room are open to whoever needs them because they are too lazy to carry their own and they did not even have the decentcy to return them, but this is to no discredit for the resort. The reason I titled this review the way I did is because of the few amenities they offer they are all extra charges outside of what you have already paid for your stay. I think for the price you pay to stay there that the parking for your one vehicle should be free. Firewood I also believe should be a free bundle per night per room if you even want to start a fire which not everyone even does. Anything outside of the first free bundle can be charged. Also to bike around the resort for an hour for the two of us was another $25, not too pricey but should still be part of your stay, still keep the time limit, and maybe a penalty fee for a late return, but free for an hour to begin with. There is only two restaurant choices and one of them is more upscale and we both brought vacation clothes, so maybe that is our fault. Our stay was nice overall the surrounding area of the resort is BEAUTIFUL and the area is easy to navigate and the resort is very close to Sea World which is nice. I would also recommend going to Ocean Beach and experiencing a true beach community. The people and the vibe at \"OB\" are very welcoming. It also has a wonderful pier and you can catch some surfers if you are lucky.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Esher, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cParty of 11 had a great stay.

PPR bills itself as AAA 4-diamonds, but the AAA tourbook only gives it 3. It was vastly overpriced for the quality: - The much-touted multimillion dollar renovations had the feel of being done on the cheap, just enough to be attractive at first glance, but actually pretty shabby upon closer inspection (chipped paint, unpatched drywall dents, falling-down mirrors, cheap mismatched door knobs, etc.) - The heater in 1 room was a very noisy wall unit from the 1970s (not central air) that roared loudly all night long - Only 2 pools were heated, the other 3 were not. - The main pool\u2019s hot tub was filthy \u2013 filled with brown, cloudy, murky water. - One of the first rooms we tried (we switched it to an \u201cexecutive suite\u201d at a significant upgrade fee) had broken curtain rods and many other cosmetic issues - The living room furniture was unmatched, and dirty (sofa cushions) - The furnishings included a broken mirror leaning (not hanging) against the wall, a rickety lounger that rocked when sat upon, and a filthy sofa (once green seat cushions turned brown with dirt) without any throw pillows to relax on. - The only shampoo was in a wall-mounted dispenser in the standalone shower, but no bottles for those using the tub (when we asked the maid, she said sorry, there wasn\u2019t any) - The bath towels were very uncomfortable \u2013 not soft and fluffy, but hard and uncomfortable, with weird, \u00bd\u201d wide \u201cribs\u201d that were annoying to the touch Think of an older, time-worn resort, with a superficial coat of make up.

We were charged $28 per day for parking and $15 per day for a \"resort pass\" on top of taxes not covered by my Priceline bid. These are non-negotiable so add $45 per night to whatever price you may find online. If you're expecting 4-star rooms like Hyatt, Westin, etc... be warned. This is 3-star quality.

My 3 yr old had a ball feeding the ducks at the pond but beware, those ducks are not shy..they will take food out of anyone\u2019s hand, so don\u2019t let them get to close to your children in case they get nipped. We also enjoyed the fire pit on the beach.. we didn\u2019t pay an arm and a leg at the store on the resort..we bought firewood at a nearby gas station and the rest at the local shopping center (had to make our own sticks out of wooden kabob skewers & tape which my son really enjoyed that project). We went to the zoo, seaport village (really neat place-highly recommend), at at Konos for breakfast a few times.. cheap, seat over looking the beach, and great food. Also enjoyed eating at the Fish Shop and Fat Fish grill. We also very much enjoyed Barefoot grill on the resort. Our waitor was awesome. Cute little bridge that connects to the marina..lots of fish and two little sharks on the water. Had breakfast there as well and then rented a paddle boat. We really enjoyed our vacation there. Not sure if I persobally would go there on peak season.. we were able to enjoy anything and everything without a crowd. I did not like the bed.. but my hubby and son didn't complain though. It was too hard for me because i'm a side sleeper. Room was clean but floors get very dirty when tracking in the sand.. they really should provide a matt for the doors that opne up to the beach.

We were initially pleasantly surprised when we checked in as we were told the room we booked was oversold and we would be getting a complimentary upgrade and in fact it was 2 levels (We booked the Lanai room and ended up with a Lagoon View). The room was pretty out dated. The easy things to upgrade (TV/alarm clock/internet) have been upgraded but the core structure of the room is in great need of attention. The heater/AC wall unit made a large amount of noise making it impractical to use when sleeping, the paint on the bathroom door had peeled in about 50% of the area and they simply repainted it (leaving behind all the markings where the paint had peeled and looking very lazy/tacky). In addition, the walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors TV prior to going to bed and were again awaken by their TV at 5:45am. The package \"included\" breakfast at their bar. The inclusion is really a $36 credit to your room for breakfast. For 2 people, you can exceed the $36 cap quite easily ordering a plate and juices (we only had coffee which was a little cheaper). So depending on what you order, breakfast is really \"mostly included.\" Finally, the resort charges $28/night for parking. This happened to be included with our package but is astronomical! Not to mention there are plenty of spaces (one space reserved for each room plus a large general parking area). Our room charge for 1 night was $260. We will most definitely choose another location next time we vacation in San Diego as we were sorely disappointed. For that rate, I expect more modern, more private (not hearing the neighbors noise) accommodations. Quite honestly a Hampton Inn or similar would have likely been much better at roughly half the price (breakfast still included).", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cAmazing resort on it's own little island!\u201d", "Author": "Jeweltravel", "ReviewID": "UR121574171", "Content": "Paradise Point is indeed paradise.

Unfortunately we were only there for one night, when going to check out colleges in the San Diego area. Paradise Point is an easy spot to stay when touring UCSD, USD and/or San Diego State. WOW. Paradise Point really is a stand-alone destination. You get off the freeway, and wend your way (five - seven minutes?) to the long driveway that takes you onto the island, then wind around to the reception area/lobby.

IF one can negotiate the room charge, even with this additional cost of FORTY-THREE DOLLARS per night, this is still an outstanding value. Because we were occupied during the days and evening with college tours and family visits, we did not avail ourselves of any of the shops or restaurants or room service, so can't comment on the quality/value of those resources. Despite our bargain basement room charge, the very nice front desk clerk upgraded us (do they do this for everyone?) and we had a lovely lagoon-side spacious room with two queen-sized beds. The bathroom was a little dated, but clean and good-looking. Plenty of towels, good shower. Shower gel, shampoo and conditioner provided in stationary pumps in the bath, but no bar soap - only outside in sink/vanity area. Hardwood (or laminate) floors looked new in our room, with tropical/primitive wall art - kind of weird but added to the ambiance. We were awakened in the morning by the ducks and/or other birds squawking nearby, outside our room. Kind of cool, but stay away from the lagoon if you want to sleep in.

Some are overlooking the bay & are probably more appealing but ours was basic, the bathroom was very small, the heat/air conditioning is from a wall unit, the tv wasn't a clear picture & the menu function option didn't work. The room had the odor of an old hotel room although it appeared clean. There was a sitting area with a couch & coffee table so other than the bathroom the size was fine. The hotel itself is motel style in which if your room isn't facing the bay you will have cars driving past to get to their rooms. I travel to SD frequently to visit my college age daughter and I've tried many hotels in the area. The rooms here are definitely Holiday Inn quality although the grounds far surpassed the ordinary hotel. The rates are incredibly reasonable so the room quality was not a huge surprise.

I purchased a 3 day package in one of the Ocean Front Villas. It was very spacious and beautiful. The TV's were massive, but lacked quality picture. I purchased a film to watch one evening and I could barely see what was happening since it was a dark film and the TV was already super dim. Management sent over a tech guy to look at it, he showed me how to change the channels and was very friendly, but let me know that there was nothing he could do about the brightness of the TV. Yes, I tried the menu, and everything else, nothing worked. Every channel was dim and pixelated, but I think this was an issue with the TV service they use. For the price I paid on a room, I would have loved lotion, which was sent over it two little plastic cups when I called reception and asked for lotion. It was a little tacky in my opinion, and so were the shampoo/conditioner dispensers in the shower. I can understand that part, but lotion in a cup? The location is breathtaking, everyday spent there was very relaxing and beautiful. The firepits were great, the ducks, geese, and everything else were calming and non abrasive like they can be at other places. I must say though, the staff was top notch. I'd come back here just to see these people, they were incredible. The food was enjoyable and fresh, and my favorite part about it was being able to take my drink with me anywhere I went.

We put on are reservation a request for a room with the best view possible for the room we were getting. Paradise point did a great job, we had a bayfront view steps away from the sand. At night we sat on the patio drinking wine and listening to music while watching the beautiful old fashion big paddle boat float in the bay, beautiful scenary especially sunset. The adult pool was great we practically had the jacuzzi to ourselves the whole time. I love that you park very close to your room. Did I mentioned we had just got married and this was our mini honeymoon, well paradise point had a staff member bring complimentary wine with chocolate covered strawberries to our room with such a nice card congratulating us on our marriage, i thought it was so nice of them. I loved that you call for a ride to get around the resort and can call from everywhere from the resturants, the pools, the island store etc. The rooms were very nice as well, we got a junior suite. You dont need to bring shampoo, conditioner or body wash ( unless you prefer a particular brand) because they dont supply you with those tiny bottles most places do, they have decent size refillable bottles in the shower, nice touch. the food was decent too. very nice atmoshere here cons: sooooo expensive!!! the prices are so ridculous, we spent alot and it as just us two and we didnt even do much, cant imagine a whole family.The resturants are extremely expensive $20+ plates, I suggest bringing snacks/drinks and microwavable food so you dont spend so much on food there, the room had a frig and microwave. The bike rentals our expensive as well, we paid for two hours but were tired by 30 minutes lol so returned it at 1 hour, they were very nice and refunded us back 1 hour since we didnt use that hour, with no hassle. Other than pools, bikes and food, not much do to there, but it was relaxing doing nothing for us both. I think the passport to paradise was a waste of money other than pool and parking that was included =/ You have to leave a $100 room deposit, but you dont get it back right away and it takes 5-10 business days after you leave to get it back =(..

Unfortunately, the checkin desk did not give me a map, nor did the room have any book about the property... like room service menu, etc. So I had to go search for a bar/restaurant.

They should try to do more to help travelers with signage. The staff was extremely friendly, and cheerful. The food in the restaurants (both dining and bar) were great and for our meetings, the same. The only disappointment was we had one fair day (the weather all week was a real bust - cold and overcast). We sat by the pool in hopes of some sun and wanted a drink. Everything was closed! We called the front desk and were told they close during the week after Labor Day! It would have been nice to tell us.

After a great day at Sea World, with the kids ready to grab a second wind at the resort, our positive outlook took a quick turn south when we got to our room. It was tucked waaay back into a little corner by the banquet facility, well away from any of the pools or amenities. It felt like we had been relegated to the forgotten step-child suite. If it was up to me we'd have complained and left that nite. Thank goodness my better half\u2019s cooler head prevailed. After a long wait and hold with a busy front desk, plus a plea to help our family's collective frown be turned upside down, we were moved to a nicer suite, between a pool and the bay!

Placing our reservations a month in advance, I decided to splurge and reserve the bay view junior suite. We arrive with an exhausted, nap-ready kid at 2PM; we were told that our room was not ready yet, we're given pool keys, and told that we could visit any of the resort's pools while we wait. I ask for our room # so that I we could park and visit the pool closest to our room... we're told that they could not disclose our room #. Huh? Things got worse from there. At 3:30, we were given the go ahead to check in. We picked up our room keys, opened the door, and discovered that we had been given a garden view suite, not the bay view I had reserved. Strike 2. Going to the front desk and requesting a new room at this point is untenable...our child is exhausted...we decide to speak with the front desk the next day. That night, after the boy went to sleep, my wife and I decide to enjoy a glass of wine and some quiet time. We discover that we're not alone...another tenant, a 2 inch long cockroach is sauntering across the floor. This roach was so big, that I could have either smashed him with a shoe or put a leash around him...he does go very well with the three spiders in the ceiling. Strike 3. The roach successfully dispatched, our wine drank, we decide to call it a night...did I mention that we had to go to the store to buy plastic cups to drink our wine because the wet bar in our suite had no cups, no plates, no silverware, nothing? We crawl into bed and discover a blood stain on our duvet. It's not an OJ Simpson sized blood stain, but large enough that the maid should have caught it...we feel the benefit of the doubt slowly shrinking away. Morning. Surprised the coffee maker works, I have my morning cup and climb into the shower. When I get out, I reach for a towel to dry myself only to discover that it is as soft as a roofing tile. Seriously some free beach towels we got at dodger stadium that we use to dry our dog are soft as silk compared with ones. After a big day we return during naptime (1:30 PM) only to discover that the maid hasn't made up our room yet...so, off to the pool we go while we wait for housekeeping. Strike #?? I've lost count. My lovely bride stays with the boy (and her cocktail) at the pool while I visit the front desk to discuss my first day at PP. The guy at the front desk promises the maid will be earlier tomorrow, to report the insect infestation, and that the OJ duvet will be replaced. And the bayview room? He tells me that we got a free UPGRADE from a Bayview Junior Suite to a Garden View Suite. How thoughtful. It would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted this generous upgrade. Day 3. The towels are still exfoliating me, housekeeping had finished by the time we returned from Seaworld, and no signs of any other 6 or 8 leg co-tenants...maybe they're turning this thing around? Fat chance. That night we ordered an early dinner so we would have time to make smores at the fire pit in the main pool area with our son. We arrive at the fire pit at 7:30 PM. No fire. A couple sitting nearby tell us that they have already put in a request to have the fire lit. Not taking any chances I go to the front desk. The woman behind the desk tells me that she'll \"put in a request for the service.\" When I ask her what that means, she tells me that she punches in the request in the computer which will cause someone to show up \"soon.\" Not very reassuring. 7:45 PM. No fire. I return to the front desk. This time there are three parties ahead of me checking in. The woman at the front desk knows why I'm there, but she pretends she doesn't see me to make me wait. When I get to the front of the line, she explains that she doesn't know why the fire hasn't been lit yet. I suggest, impatiently, that perhaps she should pick up the phone and call someone. Her manager beckons me, promises she'll have someone there right away. 8:15 PM. Still no fire. My son is doing his best at waiting patiently for smores. I am no longer patient. So I bring him and his marshmallow laden stick to the front desk. The women there still have no answer for the delay, and seemingly no empathy for my problem. Exasperated, on my way out, I tell them to \"light the damn fire pit.\" The manager behind the front desk threatens to evict me. Unreal. 8:30 PM. We talk with a security guard walking through the main pool area. He gets on his radio. The fire pit is lit within five minutes. Was that so hard? 10:00 PM. We decide to crawl into bed for our final night at the hotel. We pull down the sheets and see the familiar blood stain on the bedspread.

The room furnishings were okay, but not outstanding. The pictures on the hotel website make it look a lot nicer than it really is. There were two flat panel HD televisions; however, neither had HD cable, so the TV images were fuzzy. Oh, and there were only 7 or so channels to watch. We stayed at Hilton and Marriott properties later in our vacation, and both had better television images and channel options. We don't watch a ton of TV, but it's a nice option when you're traveling with young children who have early bedtimes. The bathroom was mediocre. It lacked basic amenities, like a towel rack. For $600 a night, I expect to get a room with a towel rack in the bathroom, so that I don't have to lay the towel on the floor while I shower. Gross. The bathroom also just didn\u2019t feel very clean. Our room had a microwave and a small fridge, but we weren't provided cutlery, plates, glasses, or even a wine bottle opener. Thus, neither the fridge nor microwave was terribly useful. We ordered room service our first night, and set aside the unused cutlery to eat leftovers with the next day. The \"helpful\" room service took our cutlery when they cleaned the room, leaving us with uneatable leftovers. The pools were fine, but not really warm enough. Honestly, the other two hotels we stayed at during the rest of our vacation had nicer swimming pools and room amenities and were substantially cheaper. I think my biggest gripe about this property is that they don't provide complimentary coffee in their lobby. There's a stand in the lobby to buy coffee, but it costs $4 per cup. But, seriously, when you're charging $600 a night, the least you can do is provide guests with coffee. Yeah, there was a dinky coffee maker in the room, but they only provided enough coffee grounds for about 1.5 cups of coffee. The property is very close to the bayside of the beach, but I\u2019d never dream of getting near the water. It was very muddy close to the shore and smelled vaguely of sewage.

We did receive a free upgrade upon check-in to a bay front room, which was nice. The view was great from there. We rented a car, which was good considering that this hotel is completely secluded from any other businesses. The problem was that it was hard to get around the grounds in the car. There are very narrow roads, which are also the walkways for people. There are constantly DOZENS of golf carts with resort staff driving around. It was just really congested with all of the golf carts, vehicles, and people walking around in such narrow pathways. Some of the paths were one way, but some people seemed to completely ignore these signs, as they were pretty confusing, and there were people driving every which way. I guess I'm trying to say that a rental car is needed if you want to eat, shop, or see any actual beaches; however, navigating a car around the grounds can be quite difficult! The first night we went to the adult pool, and it was not heated. I called the front desk and was told that all pools were heated. We decided to go back two nights later and it was heated that time. The hot tub in the adult retreat was the only one that we could go to because the one in the main pool area was super dirty! We happened to be staying at the resort during the blackout in San Diego also. This was no fault of the resort at all, but they seemed very ill prepared for such an emergency. Food was made available for a short time. But while we were waiting in line to order, they announced that they wouldn't be serving any more food as it was getting \"too dark\".

We have previously stayed here twice before and it is one of our favourite places to visit. We are always a bit wary of going back to places we've loved before, in case they've changed (for the worse) since our previous trip. However, aside from a couple of minor niggles, we had another great stay here. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we love the resort feel. The location is very handy for all the San Diego attractions, and whilst you do need a car to get around, you can tell this from the location when booking. San Diego is also much nicer and easier to drive around than LA (for us Brits at least!) The rooms had been renovated since our last trip in 2007 and whilst the comments about the dusty floors did have some validity, overall we were very pleased with the standard of accommodation - after all, you're walking about in flip flops/sandals or barefoot, so you're bound to bring in a certain level of dust and dirt. We were given 'adjoining' rooms which basically meant that we had a bungalow to ourselves which was an ideal set up. The beds were huge - and high! Having fridges in both rooms and a microwave in one was also really handy. We loved being able to sit out on our patio and have breakfast overlooking the pond. It's a shame that they've changed the toiletries, as the old ones were lovely, although they've obviously wised up to everyone taking them home! The new ones are still really good though. We never had a problem getting sunbeds by the main pool, even if arriving in the afternoon after going out for the morning. Part of our Virgin package meant that we got free parking (always appreciated - especially when it's right outside the room), didn't have to pay the 'Passport to Paradise' fee and got $25 per room, per night resort credit - which equated to $350! It seems ironic that they are trying to introduce the mandatory 'passport' fee, but none of the staff around the resort seemed to know what to do with the slips of paper for mini golf, bike hire, etc. We were however able to enjoy two meals at the Barefoot Grill (including two free desserts for one meal) and two lunches by the pool with our resort credit and still had some leftover to treat ourselves with in the gift shop! The food at the Barefoot was delicious as usual, although we were slightly disappointed to see the menu had changed - we loved their Philly cheesesteaks and pulled pork! Nevertheless, the relaxed atmosphere and beautiful bayside location were perfect for that San Diego feel. If we are to return to San Diego again in the future, we'd definitely look to book here again.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CT", "Title": "\u201cLarge property with many great amenities for families.

The employees are so friendly from the wonderful bellman, Ben, to the bartender at the pool, Bryce, to the great people at the dock where you can rent boats, boards....whatever you like. Matt Quick, the Rooms Manager and Priscilla Garcia, the Front Office Manager, helped make our stay perfect by clustering our family in rooms all together. I stayed in one of their wonderful rooms on the bay and my family was right behind me! We all had the best time and now want to do this every summer. Even my nephew and his wife and their daughter and son-in-law came over from Arizona and stayed at Paradise Point and loved it. Paradise Point is perfect for the old to the very young. Beautiful surroundings, many pools and spas to choose from. We started coming to Paradise Point in the late 1970's when my children were little and just wouldn't stay anywhere else. Now my grandchildren are coming and having the best time ever. If you want to have a wonderful vacation and be treated royally, come visit Paradise Point. Great place for a family reunion!

My experience is near on identical with many of the previously posted bad reviews. The grounds are indeed quite impressive - from a distance. They have this distinct \"Fantasy Island\" feeling about them. However, upon closer look at for instance the lake area, you will see tainted blue ducks swimming along, because the have some horrible fluorescent junk in the water. There was electrical equipment lying arund everywhere. A hazard for small children - and my inquisitive son. But the rooms - they have been refurbished? That's the biggest joke. They are sooo small and the bathrooms are absolutely disgusting. Decor could have been quite pleasing, but most of the furniture was broken. The worst thing about this resort - I will have to repeat - is the cleaning! It started upon arrival: beer and coke cans directly next to the patio. Dust and undefined dirt under the bed. This however carried on and I had to complain twice about the cleaning. Reception did not seem in the least interested and it hardly got better. We had no hand soap in the bathroom, I had to wipe out the drawers before putting some clothes in. Mostly we ate breakfast outside the property, but before going to seaworld we tried out the breakfast at the resort. Good that was horrible and exceedingly expensive. But finally there is the safety issue. We hired one of their bikes to go around the property with our son. We realized that our bungalow was probably even in one of the better locations. Some bungalows border directly onto a public park with large car park and are literally situated next to the public toilets. No walls, bushes, fences or even guards to protect the property from trespassers or whatever. The bike ride for me was horrifying, knowing that anyone could reach our bungalow by beach access. This was particularly disturbing because at night we had to sleep with the patio door open, as there were no other windows. After that I could hardly sleep at night.... All this is only a fraction of why this property should not be so expensive and in my opinion should be shut down.

I instantly thought how it reminded me of our trip to Hawaii, and how perfect this place would be, being right on the bay and with a room feet away from the sand. It did not disappoint for a second. The pools were great, the bike rentals on sight, the restaurants, quick room service, other activities, ducks and fish all around the property, but most importantly the fire pit on the beach 10 feet from our door and water another 10 feet, this place provided such a wonderful time for us and our 2 year old, that it quickly became one of the best places we have ever visited, and we travel extensively. As a side note: we wanted to come back to San Diego the next month for a quick getaway, and this place was a little too pricey being that it was June. I found the Hilton, across the street almost, and thought it was similar in features. We had such a terrible experience there that we checked out the next morning and I called Paradise Point. We were upgraded all the way to the Presidential Suite, and they saved our vacation which had so been nearly ruined by the Hilton. I can not say enough about this place, and with all that they have done for us, and how we were treated both times, this is my FAVORITE place to stay in San Diego, and should not be missed. We are going back in September. My only mistake in June was not going with Paradise Point to begin with. Don't second guess this place.

The floor in our room was very dirty, as someone else has stated. The first night I walked around the room in my socks and the bottoms were black after 2 hours of walking on the room floor.

It is very relaxing. We walked everywhere and used public transport. We had no car and found this not to be a problem as the public transport is excellent. One word of caution, watch out for hidden charges. We were charged for the passport to paradise, even though we did not use any of the facilities. When I enquired about this, it was removed from the bill. However I was warned by the young lady at reception that if I return for another visit I would have to pay th $15 charge each day. Not really a recommendation to return. I cashed travellers cheques each day and heard people complain about hidden charges every day. We did not have a car but they charge for that as well.

We had not planned on staying in San Diego or Paradise Point. My family and I were booked for a trip to Cabo San Lucas and once we got to the airport we found out that my daughter's passport had expired two weeks prior. After all of us were very disappointed we couldn't go to Mexico, we went home and I immediately checked online to see where we could fly out to that same day. We decided on San Diego and after several reviews on tripadvisor we decided to go to Paradise Point. I called and spoke to a wonderful lady at reservations and explained our story. I think she felt sorry for us, and booked us into a wonderful oceanfront room. After a very long day filled with disappointment, long plane rides, and a daughter who got motion sickness on the airplane(s) we finally checked into Paradise Point. What a pleasant surprise we had once we checked in. The room was large, with a beautiful view of the ocean, and great sand beach. Check in was quick and painless. I traveled with my Husband, 6 year old daughter, and 2 year old son. The resort is large, but doesn't feel so. They have several pools, although we spent our time only at the large main pool, there were plenty of seats, the service was excellent, and the food was good at the pool. I would rate this hotel more of a family resort, however, we only went to the main pool and there were several families here. All of the other pools were very quiet and more adult friendly. I think this resort does a good job servicing everyone. We had dinner once at Baleen, the food was very good, a little slow getting out, but a beautiful view, and a little pricey. We ate lunch & breakfast each at Barefoot Bar & Grille, the food is very good, however, the food is VERY slow getting out. Each time we had to wait over an hour for food, keep this in mind if you have small children or if you're in a hurry. We also ordered room service several times, this is also slow. The location of the resort is perfect, you are literally across the bridge from Sea World and about 10-15 minutes from the airport and Gaslamp District. You can actually see the fireworks from Paradise Point. They offer a ferry from Paradise Point to Sea World, this is really nice since you get to come in the back way, no lines. Although, the last ferry leaves at 7 pm which is unfortunate. I believe the fee is $9 round trip. If you are concerned about staying at Paradise Point don't be. I read some of the negative reviews and was a little concerned. It's a beautiful resort, that has been completely remodeled. It is well appointed, relaxing, and the service is excellent. My only complaint is the wait for food. We travel frequently, and like to stay at nice resorts typically 4-5 star.

We are frequent travelers, taking around 3-5 vacations per year (please see my other reviews) we stay at the most luxurious hotels so I have a lot to compare to, and let\u2019s just say I wouldn\u2019t even recommend this hotel to my worst enemy, that would be too mean! Airport: The airport is very small, around 20 minutes from Paradise Point. We rented a car from enterprise, it was quick and easy. They had a bus waiting to take us to the nearest Enterprise location, and we were able to pick out our car. We had GPS so it was easy to get around, and the traffic is not bad at all in San Diego. Check-in: Our check in person was Gino, wasn\u2019t he pleasant\u2026.not. He first started with asking us to upgrade to the beach suite, I thought he was giving us a free upgrade for my bday, so I said is this for my birthday? And he goes No, we only have 1 left and it would be $150 extra per night (which we passed on). Also the Lobby smells like Mold, you will notice the entire resort smells like mold! We had a room right next to this filthy lagoon; this resort would be pretty if they kept it clean! Our room had a Full bed (which they call a queen), sleeper sofa, tiny bathroom, and a desk, the run and table were missing for the couch, what a basic room for 350 dollars per night, not microwave even! The next morning after sleeping in this tiny bed, I looked at my fianc\u00e9s travel documents, to see that he actually paid $30 extra per night for a king size bed. I called to speak with the manager Matt Quick, he apologized and said that he would switch us to a new room, and not make us pay for a parking for our 3 night stay. We switched rooms, the new room was bigger about 100 sqft or so, with the worst smell ever, it just hits you as you enter. The air conditioning was broken, the refrigerator did not work, our bathroom was covered in rust and mold (I took the quickest showers of my life there because I was so disgusted), but the bed was a king! We called about the air conditioner, and they replaced the entire thing right away. We actually left that day to LA and Disneyland so we did not have time to change rooms again, but there are no windows that open to get fresh air, just a patio door with no screen. There is Shampoo, Conditioner, Body Wash, Hair Dryer and Coffee Maker, no other amenities offered in the room besides the wireless internet that you will pay for when you check out. LA/Disneyland: The road trip was beautiful, we took the Pacific Hwy all the way there. It was only a 1 hr 45 minute drive to Anaheim where Disneyland is. We love Disneyworld, and we loved Disneyland just as much. We started at downtown Disney, $15 dollars to park there and only a short walk though to Disneyland. We ate at the ESPN Zone, which is our favorite. Disneyland also had a park called Adventure Park that we did not go to, but they have Tower of Terror, and a lot of fun roller coasters. The lines at Disneyland were very long, 80 minutes per ride; we only were able to go on 4! But the experience was well worth it. After Disneyland we met with a bunch of our friends that live in Manhattan Beach. We went to Hermosa Beach to have drinks and dance, The Shore was so much fun, great music and great crowd. We ended up staying out late, so we got a deal at a near Wyndham hotel for the night to sleep, even that hotel which was $100 dollars a night was nicer than Paradise Point; at least they had a microwave, working fridge, living area, and clean! Downtown San Diego: So beautiful! I wrote down a few hotels that were there that looked nice, Marriott Marquez, and the Omni. We ate at Lou & Mickies, the food was excellent, the service was good, and they had a wonderful wine list. And the price was not very high, for the two of us with wine our bill was $68 without tip. Next time we visit San Diego we will be staying downtown. Barefoot Grill: The first night of our trip we ate at the barefoot grill in the Paradise Point. What a disappointment. It was a 30 minute wait, and when we were seated we waited another 20 minutes for our waiter to come with our drinks. After we ordered, it was like he forgot about us, never came back for another 45 minutes, all we ordered was a burger and turkey wraps. We had to ask the bus boy to find him because we thought he might have gone home. Finally when he came back with our food, which was all seasoned with something that tasted similar to Dill, I ordered my free dessert that the hotel gave us tickets for. I had the S\u2019mores Chocolate Cake, and I must say that it was beyond delicious. Beach/Pool: The Beach is quiet, and it was nice to have right at the hotel, but it was filthy, there was trash, glass, sand flies everywhere. We decided to sit there for an hour, then head to the Adults only pool. We had a Friend who lives in San Diego come visit us for the day to lay by the pool, we are between the ages of 25-27. When we arrived, the \u2018security guard\u2019 asked for our ID\u2019s, we don\u2019t look like we are under 18 so it was ridiculous. Then I had my room key, since you need that to get into their gated pools and she still asked for my room number. Then when she saw that we only had 2 people on our reservations, but there were 3 of us, she told us our friend could not use the pool. So we were told to leave! I didn\u2019t even know what to say at this point. We just went back to the beach. Check Out: The day before we left I called for a late check out, and Stephanie informed me that I need to call back the day of our departure (our flight did not take off until 6pm). Typically this is not a problem for most hotels, they will give you an extra hour or two, especially if they do not have the facilities (shower, etc) to use. When I called the day of our departure, Stephanie answer, and I started asking for a late check out, literally before I finished my sentence, all she said was \u201cNO, we are booked, sorry!\u201d I said all we want is until 2:00 pm (check in time isn\u2019t until 4pm and It doesn\u2019t take over 30 minutes to clean a room and half the people arriving aren\u2019t arriving at 4pm anyways). After telling her all of the things we dealt with on this trip, the moldy smell, the broken air, fridge, and given a downgrade in the room, she said sorry you are disappointed but we don\u2019t make exceptions. I asked for her manager, and she was eager to get him on the phone. Matt Quick was the manager I spoke with again, and he did end up accommodating me 2:00pm request. So if you call, do not speak with Stephanie, she was horribly rude. I did inform her I would post her name on Tripadvisor for her rudeness and she said \u201cgo for it.\u201d At check out, we knew we would be charged the $15.00 fee for absolutely nothing, but it is not just $15 it is $15+Tax. They also charged us $25 per day for parking which Matt Quick said we would not be charged for. I did have her take that off the bill, we were just happy to check out! Overall, our experience was horrible, I read reviews before we left, but the resort looked so beautiful online and was so deceiving I ignored the bad reviews, I know better then that. Just take my word for it, choose another hotel, you will be disappointed in The Paradise Point, this hotel makes Motel 6 look nice.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cNot what it appears\u201d", "Author": "rwhitson", "ReviewID": "UR115053940", "Content": "When I called to book a San Diego vacation with your company, I went with the advise of your attendant. So I am writing this review so you may know the real dealings behind Paradise Point so more formative information can be conveyed to your clients. The only Paradise in this place is to the owners and stock holders. There is nothing free in this place and if you do decide to eat, lounge or use there facilities it will cost-not just a fair amount but they gouge you. A smoothie at the pool restaurant is $6 served in a small cup, bike rental for one hour is $25 and to play putt-putt in their make shift little course was $10 a person. I have stayed at many resorts and I don't mind paying a reasonable amount to play but that was ridiculous for what you got. Now let me tell you about the room, the room was very small and the bathroom was made at an angle which shortened one side. It was also connected to an adjoining room, you could hear everything that was going on in the other room-not very restful. The refrigerator barely worked and if you wanted a microwave it was an additional $25 a day. They tell you at check-in that you have this so-called passport which offers many free services compared to other resorts-its bogus. Once you check out, a hidden charge of $15 dollars is added to your bill for each day of your stay whether you used them or not. They also charge $25 dollars a day for parking which I new about but that is crap-there is parking every where available, just another means to rip you off. Now let me tell you about the service. My son and his girlfriend ordered a grill cheese and tomato soup entree from the Bare-Foot restaurant (it was a little cold outside) and it took a hour to receive their food, then instead of soup they gave him a cup of marinara sauce (spaghetti sauce). I questioned the waiter and he just blew me off like I didn't matter. The whole 5 day stay that I was there the pool was never cleaned. When I arrived, the bottom of the pool was covered with dirt and during our stay, it only got worse. Paradise Point is a big resort; however it only has 4 washing machine to accommodate hundreds of families-they are not even centrally located. they were located way on the other side of the resort and the only way to get there was by foot unless you were staying in that section. I was in San Diego for 9 days, I stayed at the Holiday in Express and the Sheraton by the Harbor. I got way more for my money- which by the way was half the price- at both these places. Free internet, refrigator, microwave, breakfast. The sheraton even had activities for the kids to do-we loved movies every night by the pool. The food at the Sheraton was reasonably priced with good portions. One last thing, I charged a plain coffee to my room one morning. it cost $4 and some change. When I checked out, I questioned a charge on my bill, they said some one charged $43 to my room from a coffee cart or something. They were accusing my kids of doing it. I assured them they didn't and I wanted to see the receipt. It took awhile but they found the receipt, they charged my room $43 for my regular coffee.

The grounds are beautifully landscaped, with tropical flowers and blooming trees everywhere; kids will enjoy feeding the ducks and fish that populate the ponds and streams throughout the property, and there are bikes as well as 2-person and 4-person covered surreys available for leisurely pedaling. The resort is located on an island in the middle of Mission Bay, fringed by a beautiful mile-long sandy beach and calm waters perfect for small children to play and swim in. Mission Beach is located a 10-minute drive west for those who want wave action. Sailboats, jet skis, and kayaks are available on site for rental, and a 15-minute water taxi ride will take visitors to Sea World, circumventing the need for parking and waiting in long lines to purchase tickets (tickets for the park as well as for Legoland, the San Diego Zoo, and the Old Place Trolley can all be bought at the centrally located resort shop adjacent to a small mini-golf course). The fitness room is well-equipped with a couple of treadmills, exercise bikes, ellipitical trainers, free weights, and 8-10 weight machines; we didn't try the spa, so can't comment on that. There are five pools on the property, ranging from small and shallow for the kiddies to a large and occasionally somewhat crowded main pool adjacent to the lobby, resort shop, and fitness center / spa. Staff were uniformly friendly and very responsive to our requests throughout our stay. The Bareback Grill has excellent food, a nice view with indoor and outdoor seating, and an entertaining but occasionally somewhat annoying resident egret (?) named Harold who'll definitely make a go for your lunch if you turn your back once too often. Ask the staff for the Tabasco water sprayer if you plan on sitting near the edge of the patio dining area (!). About the only (slight) negative was that our room appeared darker than the online photos and could have used some updating. Nevertheless, I'd hasten to add that it was clean, the decor tasteful, and the beds comfortable. We were hoping to book a suite with kitchen facilities, but weren't in time to manage that; our room had a microwave and refrigerator, though, which enabled us to prepare simple meals from time to time to keep down costs. Keep in mind that parking is $25 extra per day - not sure why the resort does this, since most guests seem to have cars, but so it is. There's also a $15 extra per day resort fee, necessary to access the fitness center as well as certain other things which I can't remember, but this doesn't seem unreasonable.

The room itself did have a little bit of a musty/humid smell and feel to it but nothing that was really much of an inconvenience. The resort was very nice. There was a ton on the resort itself to do.

Pools were adequate/small, and all the \"recreational\" activities included a sky-high deposit. Parking was close enough, but the roadways in the different villages are worse than a bumper car course! In truth, Paradise Point Resort reminded my family of an older Hawaiian hotel - insanely high rates for the ambiance, but no real substance or bang for your buck. A few times we took advantage of the water taxi to Sea World, which was fun and convenient enough, but honestly overpriced as the park tickets were sold at face value so there was no real 'savings' by buying from the resort. The nightly Sea World fireworks are fairly visible from the entrance to the resort and from the observation tower by the lobby. We also ate at the Barefoot Bar and Grill three different times (for breakfast, for drinks and appetizers, and ordered room service). This place is.... again, adequate. Serves a purpose, but you better bring your patience along with enough money to pay the bill. Food is subpar and service is slow, but it IS all delivered with a smile. My group of 7 people (ranging from ages 2 - 70) stayed in 3 adjoining rooms in the Hibiscus Village (where you see and hear EVERY car that enters and leaves the resort). Each room either had plumbing that leaked, tile that was uneven, missing door screens that let in huge mosquitos; and ALL the rooms had phones that didn't work right, hotel tv menus that never functioned (we couldn't even check out from our room!), and old fridges and microwaves that should have been replaced 5 years ago. Rooms were cleaned daily, but at various hours, and we never had the same maid twice. However, there were plenty of times when other cleaning staff dropped by to chat while the maid worked (while we were sitting outside with little kids, waiting for the room to be done!). Cleaning staff also drove their carts way too fast, all while chatting on their phones. The bathrooms were also very small and sparce, almost like a motel room bath (in fact, one of our rooms didn't even have a door closing off the bath/toilet area from the sink!). For as much as the grounds staff mowed the grass (which we could hear for hours and hours in the afternoons - NOT at all a quiet and tranquil resort!), there were huge spiderwebs everywhere - on the flowers, all over the patio furniture, along the gates, etc. Seriously? THIS is what the resort is charging almost $400 a night for?!??! If you're still going to book at this resort after reading these reviews, do yourself a favor and make sure you snag a good deal from Priceline or Expedia.

The food was above average, as well as the service. The only aspect that we could offer some constructive criticism towards is that there seems to be some lacking in the attention to detail. For example, doors were difficult to open, fireplace in room had very low flames, beer can left on linai from previous guests filled with ashes and cigarette butts, somewhat non-thorough room cleaning.

This place used to be called Vacation Village which were (and still are) a bunch of brick boxes situated in tropical-style landscaping. I wish I knew this; I was expecting an actual hotel especially because of the pics, rating, and price. The rooms were \"renovated\" but that only means a new coat of paint and furniture. We reserved a bayside room but upon check-in they said they didn't have any available and that Orbitz overbooked it (I've never had that happen before). Therefore they gave us the executive suite that was large but had a slow-draining sink, 30 year old fridge, a microwave from the 1960's, slow-flowing shower, smelly sheets, hair & crumbs on the carpet, creaky bed, squeaky door hinges, thin walls, and a slight musty smell. Had I known this was a bunch of brick boxes from the sixties that had a new coat of paint I would have gone elsewhere. Ya, the grounds are nice and there are a bunch of pools and some activities for the kids but those are the only redeeming qualities but definitely not worth the price. I don't know how so many people can give this place such high ratings. Maybe they think brick-box rooms and superficial renovations are luxurious, but it absolutely does not justify the price. If this place was going for $100 - $150 per night and if I knew these were brick boxes instead of an actual hotel I wouldn't complain. Oh ya, parking is $25 bucks per day to park next to your room and there is a $15 per day mandatory resort fee (when you check-in they hand you this \"passport to paradise\" showing how the pools, internet, gym are free but they didn't tell us about the $15 per day fee, but it's not like you have a choice).

One of the appeals was that this was not a traditional \"box\" hotel. Each room is ground level and in singles and groups of two and four rooms, bungalow like. The property sprawls over 44 acres and it is VERY easy to get turned around. I got lost several times, especially at night while driving, since some of the signs were not well lit and obscured by foliage. I had a large bungalow facing one of the lagoons. It had a bedroom, walk in closet, full bath, separate sitting room, dining table and chairs, and a kitchenette with a microwave, sink and mini-fridge. My biggest disappointment was the bathroom and the bath amenities. For as much as one is paying for the stay, having shampoo, soap and conditioner on wall dispensers is kind of gauche. Housekeeping did a decent job although it was not as consistent as I would have liked. I didn't have issues with bugs, although there were a few flies and moths that got in while I had the door open. The rooms open directly outside, so this is going to happen. This is truly a resort hotel, not necessarily one for a business traveler. The wireless Internet was hit and miss and the wired connection was next to the plasma TV. There wasn't a desk, so I had some challenges taking care of business while I was here. The restaurants are a hit and miss on service. Baleen is expensive but has a decent menu. I recommend eating outside if the weather is pleasant, especially when the sun begins to set. Again, higher prices but the quality is there. The bar/lounge is OK and where I had the most issue with service. It took a while to get seated. The first time I was there, the waiter seemed to forget about me in favor of a larger group. The second time, I ate at the bar and it was much better. Again, this is a resort hotel. You pay for everything, including parking, which can be wonky with the numbered spots. This is away from San Diego proper -- about 15 minutes from the Gaslamp District -- but there are a few restaurants close by that are good if you want to take a break from eating at the resort. The biggest drawback is that the property is spread out so much and it's easy to get lost. Some of my group were concerned about walking alone late at night. The biggest plus for the property is the bell staff who have golf carts to help you with your luggage and to direct you to your room.

We were urged to be quick by the hostess and server they were eager to leave on time. THe server was impatient taking our order and kept clicking his pen and sighing. THe seat cushions,( without any cushion whatsoever) were absolutely filthy! My tomato bisque soup tasted like pasta sauce and we paid $78.00 for two kids mac and cheese a bowl of soup and an fish entree. 3. The shower still had hair from whomever used it before us and the showerhead had very low water preasure. 4. The entrance door to the room is glass with a very thin white curtain that you can see through, so you will be wakened every morning by the blazing light. 5. The walls are not sound proof! We could hear our honeymooner neighbors getting busy every night!

Other than the fact that the hotel is located right on the water and is a great location for a wedding, everything else about our stay was an absolute disappointment. To start - our arrival experience was sub-par. We arrived somewhat late at night (around 10pm) -- and we were checked in extremely quickly and given almost no information by the front desk. Key things that were omitted included: 1) We weren't given a map of the property or told what was on the property or available for us to use 2) We were led to believe that the \"passport to paradise\" services (internet, phone, fitness center, etc.) were free when in fact they are not - you get charged $15 extra per day whether you use them or not! How outrageous is that? Then we were told to \"wait outside and the bell staff will be right with you to take you to your room.\" We ended up waiting for almost 30 minutes with no updates from the front desk on where the bell staff was or when they would be arriving, we weren't invited to wait inside where it was warm - we were standing outside in the cold because we thought the bell staff would arrive any minute to take us to our room. It sucked. Then - our room: The main issue we had with our room was that when we arrived, the body wash in the shower was basically just water -- and when we alerted the housekeeping staff of this issue they said they'd refill it but they never did. I ended up using the shampoo as my \"body wash\" for our entire stay. Also it's clear that the facilities are old and only parts have been renovated -- case in point: the shower water pressure was pretty bad and the shower head was not adjustable at all and super high up and kind of crooked which was frustrating for me as I'm only 5'0 and the entire shower went right over my head. Also - the drain in our bathtub was really gross looking - it had rust all over it and was clearly part of the \"original\" pre-renovated room. Now the random added fees. I already mentioned this before - but let me reiterate what a rip-off this hotel is. First - the room itself costs at least $220 / night. And this is just for a basic room. Then - the \"passport to paradise\" - we weren't told that we'd be charged $15 per day ($45 total) for these services whether we used them or not. We were led to believe that they would be free when we checked in. We didn't bring our laptops so we didn't use the internet, and we only made one phone call during our stay. We didn't use the fitness center or any of the other amenities as we were there for a wedding and didn't have time to use the facilities. This was completely misleading and unacceptable - and we felt totally ripped off. There are also random \"resort\" fees that get added to your bill every day that you don't know about and aren't told about when you check in. Room service is pretty slow (and as with all room services, totally overpriced). One morning I just ordered tea for two people - and it took 35 min to arrive at the room. I was also slightly annoyed that when I requested milk instead of cream with my tea that I was charged extra for it ($3.50 extra) Also - as with all room services - the service charge & additional fees applied to the bill are way too expensive. Next - the location. This hotel is in the middle of NOWHERE. We were staying at the hotel for a wedding, and we were there for 4 days. The hotel has basically 2 restaurants on-site - and for 4 days, you really can't just eat at two restaurants the entire time. All food options are a $25 cab ride away (or you have to rent a car - which we hadn't - so we ended up forking over the cash just to get a meal that was different from the two menus available to us at the hotel). The hotel doesn't really give you any helpful transportation tips on how to get to the downtown area of SD without spending a ton of money either. Overall I wouldn't recommend staying here. There are a ton of other great hotels in San Diego that will probably give you much better value for your money.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Bridgewater, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Property\u201d", "Author": "ArtandNancy", "ReviewID": "UR111189801", "Content": "The resort was full of beautiful gardens and waterways.

After 6 hours on airplanes, we arrived at the hotel just ahead of the 4pm check-in time. The front desk told us their computer systems were down, and they were unable to accommodate us. They did not offer to hold our luggage or invite us to relax by the pool; it was \"Sorry, come back later!\" When we returned after 4pm, there were lines of frustrated guests in the lobby waiting to check in - plenty of people were as unimpressed as we were. Previous reviews are correct about the outrageous parking fee - it is $25 per night. This would be reasonable if Paradise Point was within walking distance to anything in San Diego and we could leave the car behind, but it's not. The hotel is set back quite a distance from downtown or the beaches. The fee was a surprise to us. We had booked the hotel through Orbitz and thought we were paid in full, so we weren't happy. There is also abundant parking - every room has an assigned spot, there's a large general parking area, and a large parking lot for the banquet hall. Parking's not at a premium so it just felt like a big rip-off. Speaking of ridiculous fees, this hotel charges for EVERYTHING. Internet has a fee. LOCAL telephone calls are $1 for the first 30 minutes, and $0.10/minute after that. Fitness center is $12/day (but it's free if you spend $75 in the spa!). It even costs money to play basketball. We joked that we wouldn't turn on the TV because they probably charged for basic cable. To add insult to injury, the room is stingy with extras. We had no soap in the bathroom, no lotion, no water bottles, and no robes. Housekeeping didn't show up until 5:30pm on our last full day (and didn't collect our neighbors' dirty room service dishes for 2 full days. Gross.) The most deceptive fee of all is the daily resort fee of $15 per day. Upon check in, you receive a \"passport\" that says for $15/day, guests receive internet, free use of the fitness center, free outdoor games, free local phone calls, and a few extras. It's worded to make you believe that you need to ASK for this bundle, so my husband and I purposely avoided all of those things to avoid the fee. We had already paid for the room once and were annoyed by the secret parking fee, so imagine our surprise when our check-out statement had the $15/day fee, for an extra $90. When my husband went to the front desk to complain, the girl admitted that lots of guests were surprised by the extra $40/day (parking + resort fee), but there was nothing she could do. In all fairness, the hotel is very pretty and well-manicured. The pools and spas are nice, Barefoot Bar & Grill is a decent place to eat, and the beds were very comfortable. But we just couldn't get past the feeling of being nickel-and-dimed to death. Basically, a very pretty, very overpriced, and borderline deceptive resort.

The rooms were large, the bathrooms nice with 2 separate vanities and closets. Furniture was first-rate. Free internet and iPhone-friendly alarm clock, and OK TV on large screens - signal quality varied by channel. Each suite had a tiny kitchenette and a large dining-room table that easily held 4 adults and a toddler's high chair. The master bed was extremely comfortable and the overall impression was almost bucolic. Ducks wandered in the grass, there were fire-pits and the sand. Even the Heat and A/C was not the usual railroad-train quality, but were quiet and even had a fresh-air option. The rooms were very quiet. So quiet that we didn't even know that a prom party with over 80 people was just next door until a HS Senior asked if they had kept us awake! The staff was very friendly and helpful, all the staff, not just the front-desk and wait staff. Even the landscapers and cleaning staff smiled and said hello. We used room service for breakfast a few times. They were friendly and fast, the food was good and delivered hot. Did I mention that it is within walking distance of Sea-World? My son walked it with ease. I downgraded the resort for its restaurants of which we tried two, a casual one with a beachy theme, and a white tablecloth starched-napkin variety. Both feature extremely-high prices. The casual restaurant is in serious need of updating. The bench seats on the booths are padded with worn-out paper thin cushions that might as well not be there. The menu was dull as was the actual food. The drinks were watery. Apparently room service comes from the same kitchen - it is 10 times better. Also, there's a live band on Saturday night. The other restaurant is very much a mixed bag and almost seems to depend on the waiter. We ate there twice. The first time were were served by Brent and the experience was worth every cent of the $100 each we spent. Drinks were strong and well prepared, the appetizers arrived quickly and were delicious. Same goes for the main and dessert courses. Our second experience there was the dinner from hell. The drinks and appetizers went fine. Then we were forgotten. Really. After 3/4 hour my son had to take his toddler son back to the room. I finally managed to attract our waiter from the night before who brought over the manager. He really didn't seem to get it saying that my grandson's food was brought quickly (true). We did eventually get our main courses and the bill was discounted but I would not recommend eating there if they're busy. We didn't try any of the many other amenities. This is a great place to bring the family. Kids can play in the sand, the bay is smooth a glass most of the time, and Sea World is nearby.

We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at the Barefoot Bar with outside dining and were entertained by the locals....birds, all types of birds. I'm not sure what Harold is, but he must get out of the wrong side of his nest each day. He was so grumpy while protecting his turf from the numerous sea gulls and egrets and ducks galore. It was a circus. Wish our grandkids were with us. Then the fishing boat arrived back at the dock and the men fed the leftover bait to the fish cruising the surrounding pond. What a commotion in that water! Several types of huge pond fish raced some birds for the biggest treats. All got their fill. The longer we were there, the more we enjoyed the place. The room was great, we had a Bayside Jr. Suite, but save some money and get the Bayside Lanai - I think they are identical, except the Jr. Suite is a bit bigger. Ask about the difference if interested, it is confusing. We did have a \"wet bar\" which used to be called a kitchenette. Still has a small microwave and mini frige and sink. No more burners. Have to ask and probably pay for utensils/dishes or bring your own. Walkilng around, we spotted some Garden View rooms that were really nicely oriented, too. They are all bungalow style. All one floor with patios. Lovely linens. but too firm of a matress. Didn't think to ask for a topper? We played the 18 hole putting course that runs along the entrance drive - and it is really a fun litlle course, white mini-bunkers and all - much nicer than it looks as you are driving in. Altho don't expect regulation greens. Even hubby liked it. Didn't try the Spa, or Baleen, the fancy restaurant - it was closed the 2 days we were there, but next time perhaps. It was our anniversary, and I mentioned that. They gave us a very nice red wine and fresh fruit. Thanks! This is a wonderful place for families..lots of activities....and honeymooners. We loved the \"adult\" pool after trying the others. So quiet and the setting is lovely with that secluded woodsy feeling. New owners just took over the place. There is some deferred maintainance - at least the main hot tub/spa needs replastering.

First off let me start by saying our son has Asperger's (high functioning autism). We were really wanting a vacation since it had been over five years since we'd taken a \"real\" vacation. Our son likes places that are nice and quiet and not too noisy. After doing some research on the Internet I thought that Paradise Point sounded like a perfect fit for our family. I had read some negative reviews on here before we left so I have to admit I was a tiny bit apprehensive but let me put those fears to rest for you. Paradise Point is the ultimate resort! They have everything!! They have five amazing pools, two awesome restaurants (with gorgous water views), and a beautiful private beach that stretches all around the property. They have firepits all along the beach as well and you and your family can make schmores there at night. The room we had was absolutely amazing!! We were steps from the beach and we had a beautiful room equipped with a fridge, king bed, computer table, nice dressers and two big screen tv's! We were thrilled!! We had a beautiful deck equipped with patio chairs that we sat in every day. Our son loved the fact that there were ducks wandering all over the property and was ecstatic that the same group of three ducks came to our door everyday!! You can buy some food at the gift shop and feed them. Very reasonable price at only $1.50 per bag. Now I mentioned before that our son has high functioning autism so we found this resort to be perfect for children with special needs because of the serenity of it all. Definately not overstimulating and noisy. I have to also mention that I believe this resort is perfect for ANY family!! I think kids of all ages would love it! We are already planning our next trip back!! The customer service is impeccable and all of the employees go above and beyond to meet your needs. They can pick you up in golf carts at any time to take you and your family to one of the pools or dinner..etc. Did I mention there is an awesome store there with everything you could possibly need? My husband and son bought me a beautiful bracelet for an early mother's day gift! Oh and so many activities.... Bike rentals, mini golf, basketball and more!! Not to mention the onsite marina with boat and jet ski rentals. This was the most awesome vacation we have ever been on and I want to spread the word!! Go to Paradise Point for your next vacation!! The location is perfect too!! Two minutes from Seaworld!! Last but definately not least the manager Pat is really awesome! He makes sure everything is running smoothly and that your happy.

We stayed in a Lanai Garden Bungalow and it was GROSS. Extremely dirty - in fact there was dirty tissue stuck to the bathroom wall and previous guests shaving gel on the shower fitting for the entire 4 night stay. There were dead flies stuck to the ceiling of the bathroom too which was very unpleasant. My partner left a pile of coins - mixed currency on the side the first day when we were out - and out our return we were surprised to find that the maid had taken it! Fair enought it wasn't a huge amount of cash, but surely by the sheer volume of coins that were there was (50+) and the fact that we had not left would make it clear to the maid that this was NOT a tip? We would certainly not tip the LACK of cleaning anyway. Additionally - watch out for the refrigerator in your room. Ours was very loud, so much so that we needed to unplug it in order to get to sleep. We let the maintenance team know and they simply came over the necxt day and replugged it in. We left it unplugged for the remainder of our stay. The walls are also paper thin - if your neighbour runs their tap you'll surely be woken up - you can hear everything that it going on around you from the room which makes for some poor nights sleep and very little chance of a lie in.

There are several fire pits on the beach, which we enjoyed using on a few occasions, but we found on the weekend that the locals also wandered over and used those too (dragging scrap wood from their trucks in the parking lot) and there is no security or anyone even bothering to check whether beachgoers are guests or not. I have nothing against locals, but we were spending a lot of money to not have at least first dibs. Lack of security, in general bothered me, especially with kids.

Their response was that the kitchen was learning a new menu and could not handle a busy crowd. Huh??? How can an established business not be prepared to seat their guests. i could understand this with a small business but Paradise Point has a conference center on premise.

Located across from the Mission Bay Beach & Sea World, and 15 min to La Jolla (north), and 10 min from downtown (south), Paradise is very conveniently located in San Diego. Here are the pluses: 1) Parking is right in front of our suites (5 yards). 2) beachfront view, peaceful, with walking/running trail 3) fire pits in the sand--we roasted marshmallows (and if your room is beachfront, perfect five star camping ground:) 4) plenty of activities to be outside: running/jogging, pedalling around the complex, kiting and segway renting along the Beach (across from hotel). 5) swimming or picnic-ing. 6) contemporary decor, marble bath, just as the photos on website. 7) the hotel staff waived our parking fee 8) free wi-fi! 9) one level rooms, no one is above you, and no noisy hallway like other high rise hotels. 10) we got free upgrade to Garden View! we were thrilled!

It was easy to get to, easy to find. even-though it is tucked away on an island in the Bay. There is a feel of openness as well as a feel of being well maintained just upon entering. After taking a leisure walking tour of the grounds I am glad that we did not get a room facing the beach. Though it has it's 3 pluses, 1), not much of a walk to get sand between your toes, 2), fire pit is practically yours (though it is 1st come 1st serve) and 3), if you get a West facing room, the sunset is yours from your cozy comfortable room. The reason I liked our grounds facing room was 1st the grounds are amazing (like you are in a manicured jungle though it won't look that way from the front entrance of the room), the breeze from the Bay is VERY gusty, and 3.) the view of the bay is, well... Boring, almost desolate. The grounds are very Disney World like in as much as the planing , care and cleanliness. We found it very relaxing and special. As for the rooms. we had some pleasant surprises, one mildly unpleasant one and 3 confusing ones. Confusing.... Parking spaces very tight ( I had to let my girlfriend out before I parked because in order to leave space for the guest parking spot next to me I had to let the leaves from the plants brush tightly along the side of my truck and we both thought it was odd that we had to enter into a shared (card locked) foyer before using the same card lock key to get into our room. Imagine after entering trough your front door, you are now in a hallway that only goes left or right (kind of like when you go to a larger theater and you have a choice to go the left side of the theatre or the right) and that there one room at each end. Thankfully the beds where not on adjacent walls. The last confusing part was that parking is an additional 25.00, but thankfully they waved this and gave a 36.00 voucher towards a meal at one of their restaurants. Not sure why, but my guess might be because of the booking problem I had when I booked on the net (I had to call to get it fixed, and they were extremely nice. Very efficient and all about fixing and pleasing) or maybe because we went in the middle of the week (Wednesday). Not sure, but was VERY appreciative!! The mildly unpleasant surprise was once we entered this hallway it smelled like there might be a pool in the next room. I am guessing that is what the other reviewers are refereeing to when they say \"moldy\", but to us it really smelled like we just entered into an enclosed swimming area. The best surprise was after we opened the drapes and saw the grounds from our own patio. You could not tell at all even after driving around or when we parked, that this was going to be part of our experience. Though the patio was was ours it was not exclusive ( we could see other rooms on the other side of the narrow lagoon) It was still quite nice, the breeze was perfect and once we were in our room, access to my truck was easier then going through the sudo foyer. We did not encounter the same experience other reviewers had in reference to un-cleanliness in the room or hearing our neighbors. Though we weren't really looking hard, everything seemed clean. Nothing jumped out at us and made us think ewwww that's gross. the other really nice surprises, were no bed bugs and the comfort of the bed was heavenly. Two last things... the food at Baleen's (on site restaurant was not only perfectly prepared and the best tasting it was visually pleasing as well. The Barefoot Bar & Grill (the other restaurant on the grounds) had so many great choices for breakfast that we ended up splitting our food. The coffee and the OJ wasn't the best and were the only disappointing parts of the breakfast. TIP....Ask for a resort specialist to see what deals they have going and not all grounds facing rooms are equal as far as view, some are amazing and more private and some are no frills.

The suite was spacious and provided plenty of room. Housekeeping was inconsistent. One day they didn't show up at all and I had to call (because the rooms are very humid when you are running the shower and it tends to stay that way all day we went through a lot of towels wiping up the bathroom floor). The curtains had mildew.....a result of the humidity of the room I am sure. Our floors were not (as far as I can tell) vacuumed. There was debris under the couch. We had a kitchenette...but there were no glasses ever provided to our room - and we saw them on the housekeeping cart so I know somebody gets actual glasses. We made do with paper coffee cups. The hotel grounds are beautiful and the staff is very friendly and helpful.. We had a wonderful trip. But overall we were disappointed with the housekeeping at our room. Oh - the pool bar service was a little disappointing too. I spent 3 different afternoons there and not ONCE did the waitress come and ask if I wanted to order anything. I'm fully capable of walking to the bar and getting my own drink, but still - I assume she was working for a reason. There was also a huge event at the hotel Saturday night and I wish we had somehow been informed that this was going to cause traffic and parking issues at the lobby/restaurant side.

She told us one of the rooms was ready but we had to wait a while for the second room to be cleaned. We went to the room to unload our luggage and take a peak at the room. No mold smell this was good, went to wash my hands and noticed the counter was dirty so I took one of there pretty white wash cloths to wash it down with and it turned black along with hair it picked up. Then a problem we could not live with: no connecting door for the kid\u2019s room. So off we go back to the front desk, they were so nice and right away gave us another set of rooms. We are now loaded back up and head for the new rooms, we walk into the first room to be greeted by the smell of MOLD (they must have known this was a problem since they had the bathroom fan on) so off we go to get another set of rooms. This time a gentlemen helped me, he took off our parking charge and gave us a resort credit for the incontinence and offered to upgrade us to a nice room on the beach but we would be sleeping with the kids on a roll-away (give us one room instead of the 2 that we paid for). I declined since I didn't want to sleep with the teenage boys, so he gave us two rooms in the back 40. (We got to listen to the work crew cutting stuff up and trip over the extension cords left out across our walkway). By this time I was just done changing rooms and ready to get on with the vacation. The room was fine except they were so dirty, at first I thought well these just must not get used so it will be better tomorrow after they clean it. After returning the next day from our outing I noticed that nothing had been wiped down and they even left us with dirty glasses. We all were walking around that night in bare feet after showers not thinking the floors would be dirty, our feet turned black! So don't forget flip flops for everyone if you don't want to shower twice before bed. It was like this everyday, on day number 4 they didn't leave us clean wash cloths so I stopped by the front desk to ask for some explaining the reason about black feet. The supervisor talked to me telling me it was not expectable and she would have our room cleaned in detail the next day including getting those floors mopped. I then went to the spa to have a pedicure and manicure done for $258 why not since my floors would finally be clean (it was worth the cost Jennifer was amazing). Needless to say the cleaning we were told would be done WAS NOT. Dirty floors, dirty tub, dirty glasses, dirty counter tops, dirty chairs, and they never wipe down the tables in the rooms. Six blissful days of a dirty room, I'm just keeping it real. Love the fact too that a moldy butter knife set outside the front door on the ground for 6 days (it was there when we got there), you would think the housekeeper would at least pick it up after walking over it everyday.

The only reason we continued our stay is because we were gone all day at the SD zoo and SeaWorld - otherwise we would have changed hotels. I can't believe American Express recommended this place. The furnishings look like the pictures but the rooms we stayed in smelled of mold and animal urine, the carpets were filthy and the travertine tile in both our suites had not been mopped and had hair throughout the suite. The rooms we stayed in had stains on the walls that could have been easily wiped up. The rooms has very poor ventilation and moisture builds up at night which intensifies the poor smell. You won't find a telephone book or a clock in these rooms or any kind of utensils other than the two tiny dirty glasses in the bathroom.

One day they brought coffee and one day they didn't. One day they forgot soap and then gave 2 soaps the next day. They made the bed and gave new towels but didn't clean the floors or vacuum the rug. Also - the beach on the side we stayed on is sad. The bay is not the ocean. Right outside our suite was some kind of concrete runoff gone amuck.

She was always there for us in directing us to the best places to eat and things to do, and would follow up with us to make sure we got there and enjoyed it. One time we were walking lost trying find a restaurant North of Paradise Point when Elizabeth called to check on us and helped get us directed to the right place. She and the staff at Island market helped us daily mapping out our adventures for the day . Elizabeth's skills and knowledge were most helpful, but most of all she did it all with a smile and personal touch. Thank you Elizabeth, Island Market Staff and Paradise Point for the most wonderful vacation stay! Mary, Ann, Mary and Judy (Our rooms were magnificent!

It was perfect, and everything else from that moment on was perfect. Awesome room, lots of privacy, excellent food, very clean room and great maid service.

Went in having read all the reviews, so I didn't want to get my hopes up...got a great deal on Hotwire, so we didn't really have anything to lose...just wanted to get a place close to Seaworld and this place was right across the street. Check-in was a breeze.Lobby area was welcoming. ROOM: Yes, it was a little strange having our\"beach-style\" bungalow right next to the road where the guests would drive by. The view outside of our door was the road and then the lagoon. So not much privacy if you open the shades. Speaking of which, the shade covering the door was too sheer and the lights of the cars would shine really brightly into the room, which was a minor annoyance. The decor was tropical island inspired and modern. The flat screen was nice, the refrigerator worked well, bed was firm and comfy. No dresser for clothes. Like other people said, the renovation on the bathroom was a quickie one. Coat of paint slapped on. They should have replaced the showerheads. Looks old and outdated. The water pressure is awful. It took forever to take a shower. Killed some bugs each day. Not a big deal though. GROUNDS: The landscaping and lagoon was so lush and beautiful. That part really felt tropical. We loved walking around with our little one, exploring the resort. They have many little pools scattered around (some for adults only and some for the family) and fire pits. You can make smores and stuff on the fire pits (they sell kits at the gift shop for $25, along with firewood...really expensive....byo). They have bikes for rent and a miniature golf area....very family friendly, but everything is expensive. LOCATION: Very close to Mission Bay, Seaworld, LOTS of great restaurants. All of the places we ate at nearby were good. We just looked on Yelp for recommendations. Also ate at Barefoot Bar for breakfast both days and had no problems. DO NOT feed the birds. They are VERY aggressive and we saw this other guest who had left his table outside for a second and the birds swooped in and started eating his food. Baleen is the higher end restaurant, right next to Barefoot. Didn't eat here during our stay. We also went to Balboa Park which was only 15 minutes away. So everything is very convenient. CONS: Yes, parking is $25 a night. They charge for internet too. The items at the gift shop (Island Market) are expensive. Lots of activities cost something. Our experience overall was a really pleasant one. I think this place is great for families and I think I would come back when my kid is older.

My only complaints would be that ther isn't a normal coffee pot in the room, they have the type that uses the little pouches to make single servings and they charge for internet $10 per day which I was not willing to pay but would really have liked to have.

I was a little nervous because when we normally book trips on-line, we are somewhat familiar with the city and hotels. For this trip we had to total trust customer reviews and the hotel website pictures because neither of us had been to San Diego before or heard of Paradise Point Resort. We got a great rate, and upon arriving at the hotel, the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. When I happen to mention in passing that it was our honeymoon, they upgraded our room (even though we had pre-paid through travelocity). Throughout our stay they were accomodating of our needs and extremely helpful with suggesting restaurants, local attractions, etc. We enjoyed our guest room and found it very comfortable and cozy. We had a suite that you walked directly into from the driveway, and it had a private patio with a little creek behind it. It was very relaxing and very different from a traditional hotel experience. The location was great too. We rented a car and found it very easy to get around San Diego and its surrounding areas. It would only take between 2-10minutes to get anywhere, even downtown. And, our room had a parking spot right next to the door, so parking was extremely convenient. Although we were spending our honeymoon there, we were also impressed with how family friendly Paradise Point is (yet, we didn't feel over run by kids- definitely a plus for newlyweds just wanting to spend some quality-quiet time together for their honeymoon). We feel as though when we have a family we would definitely go back and stay there. Overall, Paradise Point was a great experience that I would recommend to family, friends, colleagues and anyone else. The pictures that you see on-line are a true representation of what you see and experience when you get there. I would go back in a minute and as my husband says....that means/says a lot considering that I am a picky traveler when it comes to cleanliness, comfort, and quality :)", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay\u201d", "Author": "IslandGrl74", "ReviewID": "UR94787271", "Content": "Hotel was beautiful, excellent service- note that this is a large resort- the nicest rooms are farthest from the restaurants/meeting rooms and lobby, but you cannot beat the bay view rooms if you can stay in them.

Sea World is located about a mile from the hotel and if walked would only take around 20-30 minutes. Staff are genuinely friendly and don\u2019t seem at all pretentious.

I was totally unhappy with my hotel when I arrived in San Diego. At midnight I called a couple places and had a hard time finding a last minute room.

We were astonished that the winter rates were so low and how much we got for our money. The decor was excellent, the bed and bedding were excellent and the service was top notch. We started each day with breakfast in bed and loved everything but the weak coffee. We thoroughly enjoyed the 40 plus acres of resort, they have everything you could ask for from a vacation resort. Even though the resort is on an island, we found it very easy to drive up Interstate 8 to lots of food and shopping. My son had a great time playing in the sand just outside our room. We enjoyed the sunset each night from our little porch and we had full view of hundreds of sailboats, wind surfers and people kayaking. The atmosphere was full on recreation, vacation and fun. They had all sorts of spa services, equipment rentals and pools/water features. I can see coming back to this place for many years to come as my children grow up. It's perfect for all ages and anyone can find something they like even if they like doing nothing. It's around the corner from Sea World and many other San Diego must see's. I enjoyed my stay so much that I truly did not want to leave. This place far exceeds all the other places I have stayed in San Diego in room quality and cleanliness. The tile floors and pretty wooden Balinese style bed made me want to stay for a month. It is a huge resort and they have plenty of room during the winter, I am sure they fill up in the summer months. My complaints are minor. The shampoo smelled good but was watery. There was an unfortunate rust spot in the bathtub that kept leading me to think it was a huge spider. As I mentioned, the coffee from room service was more like tea, very very weak. Otherwise this place was perfect.

Wouldn't recommend it for others with small kids. Read on for a, hopefully, nuanced description of our stay. We are currently at the hotel and leaving this morning after a 4 day night stay. We rented a very expensive bay-side bungalow which has a \"kitchenette\" (more on this later), separate bedroom and living area. The porch opens out onto the bay beach. This is a family trip and we have two small children with us. Pros The location is right on Mission Bay with great views day and night. The beach is good for small kids to beachcomb with 19 fire rings for a late night smores fest with the kids. There are five pools and multiple hot tubs that are heated. The ambience of gas-lit tiki torches down the main drives is beautiful. You're within easy driving of restaurants/bars in Pacific Beach and not too far from La Jolla with a huge range of choices. Great location for seeing the sights in San Deigo and environs. Cons It's very irritating how the hotel nickles and dimes you on everything. They charge a $25/day parking fee (which they'll waive under certain circumstances) for parking in front of a $400/night bungalow. There is a fitness center, but that's an extra $12/day/person. There's a village store where you can buy a small wood pile for a beach fire, but, oh, did you want a starter kit for that. It's extra. Need matches or lighter, more yet. Did you want a late checkout? That's $50/hour. The service is horrible. The first night we needed extra blankets (none on the pullout in the living area) and had to call 3 times over more than a half hour. We had similar experiences later in the trip. However, the room cleaners were good and eficient.. The bungalow \"kitchenette\" consisted of a microwave and a small cube refrigeratot. No plates, no cutlery, nothing. The doors on the kitchenette are hanging badly on the hinges and wouldn't close properly. Hard to describe it as a kitchenette. The bungalows are in serious need of being refurbished. It's clear that someone made an effort and slapped a coat of paint on everything, but things are old and dated. A sink spigot in the bathroom was so broken that it was hard to shut off.

I also wanted to make sure the room had 2 beds. It has happened in the past where I have reserved a rooms with 2 beds and still received a room with only one. I was on hold for 20 minutes and when I finally got through I was told that there was no way to connect me with reservations or the front desk as it was after hours. The person on the phone informed me that I had been on hold for so long because no one was picking up at the reception desk. My call finally rolled over to her and she was at a different location. Upon our arrival, we found driving around the property a bit confusing. The small signs indicating where the check in location was, were not lit. In fact, the entire resort was not very well lit at all. I\u2019m all for ambiance but I would still like to see where I\u2019m going. During my reservation process there was no mention of the fee for parking, which adds $25 a night. I would have rather paid a little more for the room ($10 at most) then be charged for parking. San Diego is a place where vacationers have cars. That being said, pretty much everyone will be paying for parking. Separating it out is only beneficial to a small portion of guests. When we went to park our car in our \u201cassigned\u201d parking spot, there was already a car parked there! In addition, the $150 a night for incidentals was a lot. The receptionist had to reduce the amount by $100 as the total amount was higher than my credit card\u2019s limit. The room was lacking in some conveniences. A coffee maker would have been nice. There was a coffee \u201ccart\u201d on the other side of the resort. I am sure I\u2019m not the only person that does not want to have to get dressed to drink my morning coffee. The first morning I tried ordering coffee through room service. There was a fee for \u201cdelivery\u201c AND fee for \u201croom service\u201d, as well as a 20% auto-gratis that the attendant told me was pooled so I gave him an extra tip. This brought my total for coffee and 3 small pastries to almost $40. I ended up buying coffee and a coffee maker at a local CVS. I also bought myself a mug at the store, which room service took when they cleaned the room the next morning. I called the front desk to let them know but it was never returned. A pair of sweatpants that I had bought for the trip was also taken. The room was nicely decorated however I would not consider the room all that comfortable. The mattresses were lumpy and one bed had a cheap blanket while the other had a down comforter. Of course I was the unlucky one who picked the bed with the cheap blanket. The heating/cooling system only seemed to operate on hot or cold (no in between). There was hardly any pressure in the shower, even with the adjustable head. These things were aggravating however the problem I found the most frustrating was that there were ants EVERYWHERE. They were in the bathroom, under the bed and worst of all in the bed. I woke up with ant bites all over me, even after they came to spray twice. Honestly I think they should have either moved our room or compensated us somehow. The last night we were there we went to have drinks by the pool. Apparently the pool bar closed before the sun even set. We used the phone near the pool to order drinks through room service. It took almost 2 hours for 2 drinks to come. Everybody by the pool was ordering drinks through room service so I\u2019m not sure why the bar was not staffed later. There were several amenities such as WiFi and a Fitness center however all were a significant additional price. The restaurants were decent but not great. If I am paying $70 for breakfast, it better be more than decent. Overall I would say I was disappointed. I would have rather stayed at any number of chain motels that has comfy beds, free parking and coffee in the room. I would have saved money and been more comfortable. My experience left me wondering exactly what makes a resort 4-star? I looked it up and the rating is somewhat subjective, however Paradise Point did not even come close to meeting the 4 star rating standards. Perhaps they have not been reviewed in a while? Maybe they were tipped off to who the reviewer was? Or maybe... they give service according to how much one pays for their room? The hotel emailed me and asked for a review and when I sent it to them, I never heard back.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, California", "Title": "\u201cParadise Point is my mini heaven!\u201d", "Author": "gusbeever", "ReviewID": "UR89209606", "Content": "This was my first trip to San Diego.

We were quite upset we still had to pay $50/day for parking and the food there was quite expensive and the quality just wasn't that great. Needless to say we expected more. Having to still pay for internet access seemed pretty frugal for the price too. I happened to need my eyebrows waxed so I figured the spa there would be a great place to get it done. Needless to say I ended up getting my money back because the beautician waxed off half my eyebrow. I wish I was joking. Needless to say the $30 wax wasn't worth it. Oh and gratuity is automatically added to whatever you get at the spa. You don't have a choice. The resort isn't very easy to get around either, lots of one way streets and confusing turns. Just look at the map. Our room was nice, not super clean though. The set up in our room was very awkward too. Our bed faced windows and the T.V. was on the left wall. Therefore, we had to lay in bed or sit on the couch and look over our shoulder to watch T.V. The bathroom was beautiful, until you got to the toilet/shower part. Marble around the sinks and then the toilet/tub was super small and awkward to say the least. Definitely expected more from first walking in the bathroom. The windows in our bedroom were also well covered, but our room had two doors each which led outside. The doors had curtains, but didn't cover any of the edges. And both doors were by the bathroom or closet, where you had to walk past. It was definitely awkward to know someone could be walking past and could see you. We also had to report our shower head when we got there because it was spurting water out of the pipe instead of the head. They close the 'Adult' pool at 10pm, which is a little ridiculous for any hotel I think. Never experienced it closing that early at any hotel we've been to. Overall, we expected more.

We were also able to walk along sidewalks across the bridge to restaurants and stores in Crown Point. (We found the restaurant good but expensive.) We could have continued to Pacific Beach if desired. Comfy bed with perfect pillows. The room was inviting and clean with a back patio to view the bay. Lots to do -we didn't have time for it all. We mostly enjoyed a pool & hot tub reserved for adults. (There were 3 or 4 more pools for families.) The staff were very helpful and pleasant and made us feel that we were valued guests.

We paid $500 a night for \"Bayside Bungalow.\" When we were taken to our room by one of the staff, we were told that the resort had recently been updated. If that is the case, I would hate to see what it looked like before. Here is our pro/con list and keep in mind the cost per night when reading the list. Pros: -Very good food. We ate several meals (including all of our breakfasts) at the resort. Everything was very good. -Helpful, courteous staff. Everyone was very nice and they went out of their way to give us excellent restaurant recommendations. -Location next to the bay with easy access to sand and water. This is helpful when you are traveling with a small child, especially one who likes to play in sand! Cons: -Poor quality physical environment. For the price we paid, we were VERY disappointed with what we got. It simply looked like they redecorated rather than refurbished these rooms. We have stayed in far nicer hotels for about half the price. Even our honeymoon at a luxury resort in Anguilla was cheaper and far superior to this one. -Poor quality amenities. Towels were hard and uncomfortable. Not many extras in the room. No notepad and pen. No lotion/mouthwash. One phone. These things don't sound like much but when you pay that much money, they had better be in the room. Even the Days Inn has a notepad in it. -Paper thin walls. We could hear the baby crying next door to us (as I'm sure they heard our son crying as well). Wasn't expecting an exclusive Bayside Bungalow to be connected to another one (perhaps this was my own fault). -Everything was extra. I know this is common for resorts, but parking was $25 per night. The gym was $12 per visit (hence we didn't workout) and internet access was $12.95 for 24 hours (also didn't use it). -Location is not the best. It wasn't bad and not hard to drive downtown but there is not much going on immediately outside of the resort. If we were to do it again, I would have either stayed in La Jolla or at a hotel downtown.

Plus side Great location, Easy driving distance from the airport, Sea World, Old Town San Diego (great restaurants in Old Town), parks etc. The resort feels very lush with many pools to choose from, and the fire pits are a nice touch. Staff was helpful with directions and at check-in. (your on your own getting to your room) The Negatives: Stayed in room 158, the beds are the worst I've ever slept on. The beds in the room need to be replaced, they are saggy, and every time you moved the springs creaked like a cheap motel 6 bed. (Wife and I had the worst sleep ever on a bed here) As mentioned from a previous reader, resort is quite large and when we checked in, we got a map and basically had to fend for yourself to find the room. It was kinda funny watching people wander around looking for their room especially at night when its dark at the resort. Not cool. Their high end restaurant (Baleen) is way over priced and average food. Wife ordered the steak and I had the halibut dish. Both were very salty. This is to bad since the location is lovely and the waiter was nice. Their other restaurant (Barefoot) has okay, breakfast food nothing special, their dinner wasn't great. Again nice location. The waiter/waitresses were average Paying $25.00 per day for parking and $9.95 per day for slow internet is ridiculous. Isn't the rooms expensive enough?? My one major recommendation if you stay in their garden view rooms is request a room that isn't facing the road around the resort.

From my understanding this hotel has recently been taken over by a new company which has begun/ already completed some major renovating. The grounds are pretty and very well manicured (reminded me of Hawaii) and the hotel is unique because it sits on its own island right in mission bay. The location is good if you're looking for a relaxing , resort-like feel, and want to be close to the beach. Although I would not advise you swim in the bay, it is very close to the Pacific side beaches and other San Diego attractions. There are tons of pools and water activities The hotel's unique setting is about the only thing I found charming about this place. The rooms LOOK nice but a closer look would reveal that it is a small facelift on a VERY old hotel. The rooms all seemed to be a good size and have neat outdoor lounge areas (some with great views). However the beds are not very comfortable and the bathrooms still seem to have the \"original\" hardware. I would guess the original hotel must have been built in the 60's-70's and it shows. Many of the exterior buildings, pools and facilities show hints of their age which just made it feel.....old. The service seemed to be average. Nothing above and beyond. We did eat at the more upscale restaurant between the few that are on the property and it was a very good dinner but it was a bit on the pricey side. A lot of nickel and dime-ing (25$/ day to park!!! = ridiculous) Basically, I feel like this hotel is pretending to be something it is not. I give it credit for trying to be some sort of 5-Star resort, but unfortunately the pools, rooms, structures, design, service etc. just are more of a 3-Star which makes the room pricing a bit ridiculous. I would NEVER stay at this hotel if the rooms were anymore than $150/night (for the more standard rooms anyway). Overall we had an enjoyable average stay. Good for just a weekend trip. I have stayed at MANY 4-5 Star hotels and this just is not one of them. For the prices they command I would really look into staying other places.

Beautiful trees, shrubs & flowers, birds everywhere. Kind of like being on your own island! There were 5 pools to choose from and they seemed to be all kept up well.

We told her that my husband and I were there to celebrate our 30th anniversary and she had a bottle of wine sent to our room! Thanks again Elizabeth! The restaurants were all good, especially the Baleen, although spendy but so worth it. One thing we didn't like about this place was how far we had to walk to get anywhere. We did see a lot of other people getting rides from the hotel staff on golf carts, but we didn't know how to go about doing that and never asked or were told, so we just walked. At least we got our exercise! If you stay there, and don't have your own car or rental car (we opted not to since we were told there was a $25 per night parking fee), you do have to pay dearly for taxi's or the trolley. We liked the trolley and took that 3 times during our weeks stay. It took you to many places around San Diego (Little Italy, Gas Light District, Old Town, Balboa Park/Zoo, Midway Museum, Coronado Island) and you could get off and on as many times as you wanted providing you got back on at a certain time and it would take you back to your hotel. There was just one thing that made us kind of mad is that there were no phone books in the room, and when we called and asked for one they said they didn't have any. We feel that the reason for this was so you didn't call for food delivery from somewhere else, but we called googles free 800 # and got Pizza Hut delivery one night anyway!

This is an older established resort so don't expect everything to be perfect or completely pristine. Go into it with an open mind. It is a little pricey for the quality of room, but I found the grounds and location more than offset for the difference. The dinner we had at the restaurant was second to none. Great service and excellent cuisine. The full course special they had along with one entree was more than enough for two, and they have specials on bottles of wind daily. Look for specials and discounts on the rooms from travel dealers online. For me and my wife we able to spend three days there for around $600 dollars along with spa treatments.

An awesome family vacation - can't wait to return!\u201d", "Author": "timberrex", "ReviewID": "UR78003878", "Content": "We are grandparents (ages 49 and 53), daughter and son-in-law (ages 31 and 34) and three children (ages 3, 6 and 9). Our stay was for three nights. We had two bayside bungalow rooms (adjoining.....may want to re-think that as the grandkids had \"easy access\" to grams and gramps at 6am! haha) that had \"awe-mazing\" views of the bay, were clean, quiet and beautifully decorated. Bed was comfortable and linens were crisp and clean. The kitchen and bathroom were great - good water pressure, plenty of storage and lots of towels. Our plan was not to have to leave the facility at all and to enjoy all the resort has to offer and we had great success! We rented tandem bikes, played the mini-golf course, went to the main pool several times and spent a lot of time on the bay's beach. The lagoon area was a huge hit with the kids, as they have hundreds of ducks and birds that the kids can feed (the cranes were amazing to see!). We rented two jet-skis one day and a large motor-boat another day so the entire family could experience Mission Bay together. SO much fun! The marina staff were knowledgeable and friendly, the vehicles were in great shape and the prices were reasonable. We ate at the Barefoot Bar & Grill three times and ate at the Tropics Poolside Grill once. The food was good and the prices were reasonable (there were 7 of us and the tabs ranged from $70-$100). The staff at each were very nice. We loved the fire-pits on the beach and had a fire going every each night. We made s'mores each night and cooked hot dogs one night. A GRANDPARENT'S DREAM: We hardly had the TV on at all during the trip and the kids never asked to play Nintendo DS or video games - there were SO many things to do, it was great! As for the bad online reviews that were somewhat scary to read before we left....... a few things: 1. The $25 parking fee. Your parking space is right by your room - super convienent. The fee prevents \"non-resort\" people from coming in, using the facility and clogging up the roads and the beach area. It was worth it and seems fair - would you want \"Joe Blow\" parking next to your room? No. 2. Ants, bugs, dirty floors and old rusty fixtures. This is a beautiful tropical, sandy beach setting - you can not help but track in some sand (the grandkids did a great job of that! haha - felt sorry for the housekeeper!). I saw one spider - the horror! (LOL) and a few ants...big deal. The room was recently re-modeled, so did not see any old rusty fixtures, but even if I did, c'mon this place was originaly built back in, what? The 1950s or something? They have done a great job keeping it current. 3. \"Nickeled and Dimed\". Not really! We paid $20 an hour for the tandem bikes, $8-10 for the mini golf, $95hr each for the jet-skis and $150hr for the large boat. ALL REASONABLE. The ONLY bad thing to say is that there were one or two lagoon areas that needed some TLC. We could understand why some people would not appreciate having their room facing them. It seems like they are upgrading the lagoons though, as the ones on the west side of the property looked great. We all had such a good time that we are thinking of coming back next Summer.

The entire family was looking forward to this vacation. The web page for the resort was breathtaking. It made it seem like we would be on a tropical island. As we drove up the drive way it seems tropical. But as we pulled up to the lobby there was no bell man to help with the luggage. That should have been the first clue that this was not a 4 star resort. I walked into the lobby while my husband waited in the car with our kids. The lobby was small and looked a little out dated (clue number two). The gentleman at the front desk told me that we would be charged $25.00 a night for parking, that we had not been told at the time of booking. And if I wanted to park for free that it would be a 15 minute walk outside of the resort grounds. Once we had been given our room number we got back into our car and headed out to find our room. As we drove around we noticed the flat roof style huts with one door but two room numbers. They don't show you this at all on the web page (clue number three). At this point we don't like what we saw but hoped that the inside of the room would make up for the exterior of the buildings. We open the door to our hut and notice two more doors. One to our room and that of another room in the small hallway that connected us, the foor was discustingly dirty. It looked like it hadn't been swept in weeks. Cobwebs all along the walls with dead bugs in them. Once we walked into our room the smell of mold over powered us!! The beds where new with nice headboards and a new flat screen TV, but that couldn't block the smell out. The shower head was rusted and half falling out. All along the tub we could see the mold, crack and rust. The tropical view from our room was one of a fence with dried out plants that gave us a view of the busy street outside the resort. I couldn't believe this was the same resort I had seen on the web. I felt robbed and cheated. Who rated this place more then 1-2 star was crazy.

The public parks that border the resort are equally lovely and offer endless places to just sit and relax and gaze at the bay. For half our stay we were joined by our extended family.

We didn\u2019t have to pay for parking, internet or the gym as they were included in this price. I found the internet speed to be VERY slow and am very happy I didn\u2019t have to pay for it. Room: The room was nicely decorated but the bed was hard as a rock. The bathroom had paint peeling off the walls and the toilet was way too close to the door. I\u2019m not sure why it was placed so close to the wall when there was plenty of room to in the bathroom to move it away from the wall. We had a small fridge in the room that wasn\u2019t working when we arrived. We called to have it fixed and maintenance was there quick to fix it even though we called at 10:30 pm. View: Our view was supposed to be of the \u201cGarden\u201d however we had a view of vehicles who parked in front of our door or the building across the street. We asked about an upgrade and were told we could pay an additional $100 a night for a bigger \u201cGarden\u201d view, we decided to stay with the room we had. Location: They will tell you Sea World is a 10 minute walk, this is NOT true. It was more like a 30+ minute walk. It\u2019s a $20+ cab ride to anywhere (Old Town, Downtown, Balboa Park, etc.). They don\u2019t offer any shuttle services so a 6 day trip got expensive quick. Pools: There were multiple pools. The only ones we visited were the main pool (to eat at the diner) and the adult\u2019s only pool. The main pool was very loud and crowded. The adult only was nice when there were no teenyboppers running around. There was no hotel staff there to enforce the adult only rule. Restaurants: There are 3 restaurants on site. Since everything else is so far away you pretty much have to eat there. We visited all 3 of the restaurants over our 6 day stay. They are all over priced with slow service. The food was descent but not worth the price they charged. We paid $15 for a burger and $13 for a salad (with no meat) on a regular basis. Spa: I did visit the spa one day to have massage. It was probably the best part of the resort. It was a little pricey, but not outrageous. I paid $210 for a 90 min hot stone massage (price includes 20% tip).

We had paid more than $750 per night for a room on the bay (after getting a group discount). We had two people in front of us in the check in line. It took us more 45 minutes to finally get to the counter to a rude and arrogant clerk who also informed us that we would be charged an additional $25 per night per vehicle. We got our room keys and we were guided to our room by another clerk who opened the door and let us in. The room seemed okay, but not the high-end, $995 per night resort room on the bay we had been dreaming of. We left the room to have dinner and drinks at the bayside bar in the resort for a couple of hours. When we returned to our room that night the keys refused to open the door to our room. We took the dreaded LONG walk to the lobby in the dark to have the keys reprogrammed. Again with only two people in the line in front of us, we waited another 50 minutes to get to the counter. We were told that we were staying at the wrong room and we would have to move. They gave us a new set of keys and sent us out with yet another clerk to show us the correct room. Needless to say that we had to repack our stuff and move to our assigned room under the supervision of a suspicious clerk. Our new bay side room opened to small body of water and a beautiful noisy freeway bridge. From this point on we felt that this place was an absolute rip-off and not a high-end resort we had expected at this price. Two cheap paper cups for four people (no glass cups), loose screws on the door locks with multiple- trial- screw holes, a wrong size shower curtain that was too short and too wide (too many holes for the number of hooks) causing the bathroom floor to be flooded with every shower, a noisy bathroom fan that shook the bed posts in the next room but did not suck the bathroom air, a hungry ant colony in the kitchen that immediately covered the complimentary two-day old cookies and the leftover food from our dinner of just an hour earlier, a highly over-priced nacho chips plate with a dab of cheap frozen imitation guacamole and a few drops of SqueezeIt imitation cheese, $12.99 for an in-room movie, $4.50 for a 95 cent bottled water.

I hope you find this review helpful before you book your trip. I have vacationed at a Sandals Resort in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, a resort in Cancun, Mexico, and the Hyatt Hill Country Resort in San Antonio, Texas. Paradise Point in San Diego does not come close to any one of these other resorts and the San Antonio resort I mention doesn't even have an ocean, lake, river or any type of body of water around except for their excellent man made lazy river that runs around the entire pool area. First of all - It is over priced. The grounds are not gated and while enjoying a nice quadracycle rental in the property we noticed what appeared to be a local police officer talking to a guest about what looked like a car break in. We also had someone run through our patio that hotel security staff was chasing. The pool area was not impressive at all - its a little larger than the average hotel pool but no slides or diving boards or anything really unique like you would find on other resorts. The room was old - averagely cleaned - we had purchased some food for breakfast one night to find ants crawling all over it the next morning. After complaining to the front desk - received a $100 credit at one of their restaurants - the food was bland and very average for the price - we tried to use the credit at the restaurant but we chose to eat out the rest of our trip. Also - cheap pergo flooring and knock off scandanavian furniture does not make it a 4 star room and the old noisy window units....really? We took a drive to La Jolla about 15 - 20 minutes away. We saw the real paradise in La Jolla. In La Jolla - you can really enjoy the beach - \"not\" the bay. The bay at Paradise Point is nice but you really don't want to swim in it - kayaking and fishing are fine but actually putting your body in there - at your own risk. We have concluded - our next trip to the San Diego area - will be in La Jolla. Anywhere relatively near the beach is fine - Wow - what a beach! You have it all in La Jolla including the aquarium and the zoo and Balboa Park are only 20 minutes away. In conclusion - Paradise Point should be called Motel 6 on Paradise Point.

As we were refugees running from our other hotel, we all agreed, we were now in heaven. The property was beautiful. We drove in the the lobby, the staff was very friendly, and we followed Tattoo in his golf cart to our room. Our little half a duplex with garden view was updated, clean, comfortable, quiet, even with a putting green right behind it. The grounds were beautiful. We spent most of our time running around San Diego as when we travel, we go to see other places, not other hotels. We did use the pools, gift shop, laundry, and have fun walking around the grounds. We agreed if our kids were smaller, they would have been able to occupy themselves for hours with the putting green( all the resort kids were playing mini golf on it!), riding the rental bikes, playing on the private beach, hanging out. The common area in the center has ponds, ducks, herons, and an observation tower to climb. You can see the fire works from Sea World nightly from many places on the grounds. We generally stay at hotels, not resorts, so maybe I am easy to please, but I've payed as much in San Diego in high season and gotten much less. The only negative was having to pay for internet connection, so we went without. We over heard a couple of women in the gift shop snottily discussing the clothes ($50-200 items). \"They are soo ugly.

It makes you feel as if you at a resort rather than just a hotel - Very large rooms with kitchenette and living room (if you stay in a beach bungalow ) - you never need to leave the resort if you don't want to. Stores and restaurants on site. - new modern designs of rooms (stayed in room 544) - spa treatments were some of the best I've had (they add 20% gratuity and the treatments are pricey, but worth it) (try the hot stone massage!) Negatives- - the rooms do not have blackout shutters so when the sun comes , up so do you - the bay is not really private so boats can drive up it all night making for some noise (I am a light sleeper and was awakened several times where as my husband never heard a thing) - they charge you for EVERYTHING extra. Parking is $25 a day, mini golf costs, etc (even Internet) One last tip- we decided to walk to sea world from the resort as there is no shuttle. The front desk lady said it would be a 15 minute walk. It was more like a 35 min brisk walk so if you are with kids you may want to f skip this walk Still the place makes you feel as if you are on a tropical island rather than in San Diego and it is a great place. -service at the Baleen restaurant was less than amazing but the food was great!! -", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAn island, for better or worse\u201d", "Author": "mehudson1", "ReviewID": "UR70447799", "Content": "Super fun to be on a resort on an island.

Here's what you need to know: The Bayside Bungalows are located on a public, not private, unmanicured beach. These are by far the best rooms on the property, but they are dual unit buildings, meaning you are not getting a private, quiet bungalow, and you share the fire pits they mention with your bungalow neighbor, the other bungalows, and the general public coming to use the beach. That said, our room, 541, was in a nice location on the beach, definitely one of the quieter sections, and just what we wanted as far as being able to go right out our door to build sand castles and find shells. The room is not fancy, but it was clean, bright and had a cute beachy feel. There are very few ammenities-the beach bungalows do have a coffee maker, microwave and fridge, but no lotions, soap, etc., that you would expect-so you feel like you are staying in a condo, not a $450 a night hotel. But AGAIN, I thought the room was fine for our family (the bed and pull out couch are super comfortable!) on a beach vacation. For our children, the highlights of this hotel were roasting marshmallows poolside and swimming after dark (there is one pool with two giant fire pits which they light at 7pm: skip the beach pits and come here, then swim in the 85 degree pool or the 104 degree hot tub!), followed by feeding the residing ducks and checking out the shark and other cool marine life swimming in the lagoon at the Barefoot Bar and Grill.

YES, this place is great for families. Lots of things to do, but we never had an opportunity to try any out as we LEFT after one night stay. We were at Disney all day and knew that we would be arriving late. Upon arrival we were directed to a Presidential Room (the 800 buildings). I thought we were lucky to have gotten this suite. I wanted to check out the room before unloading the car. I went in to find only a king bed (we are a family of 5). We reserved a 1 bedroom garden view. Called front desk and she informed me that our room is having maintenance issues and that we would have to change bungalows (tis was NEVER mentioned upon checking in) We explained the room would not accommodate all of us and she stated that she could put us in a one bedroom bungalow with a bayside view, but we would still have to change since this room is reserved for another beginning the next day. After some discussion with her, she agreed to find something else for the other party and let us have this room the entire duration of our stay.

I thought the kitchen are would have more than a microwave and tiny refrigerator...no utensils, stove, plates, coffee maker...not a full kitchen! The window treatments were faux wood blinds that were not working. Our particular bungalow was the last in the row with a beautiful hedge on the side. Since we arrived so ate we were not able to see the grounds, but in the morning my husband walked out side, popped his head over the hedge to fine that there were public restrooms on the other side with HOMELESS people sleeping of the floor.

Coming from the north, as we entered the Mission Bay area I noticed a sudden change from busy city surroundings to a quiet island setting. Part of this quietness, I think, is due to efforts by the city itself: we witnessed the bay patrol stop a speeding jet skier on the bay and asked him to slow down. This reduced both noise and possible hazard to vacationers who were using leg or wind-powered craft on the water. We ate primarily at the bar & grill, where the food was impressive (presentation as well as quality) for a simple family patio restaurant. It made me want to try the main dining restaurant, but we had no time during our 2-day stay. The rooms were very comfortable and decorated in an appropriate island motif. One of our friends said that the entire resort had all its rooms recently redecorated. The only comment I would have is that the hotel could do with a better coffee cart service, especially in the morning.

After a fair amount of research and speaking with Annette Ross, the reservations manager, I felt confident this would be a great place to stay with kids for 3 nights, one of whom has a walking disability and daily therapy. We arrived in the evening down a tropical path illuminated by tiki torches and were greeted by very friendly front desk staff and checked in promptly. Upon arrival to our \"upgraded\" suite we entered a room that was dirty (sink with food particles in the drain, bugs in the bathroom area, dirt all over the light switches, paper on the floor, cob webs in the corners... obviously not the clean I am used to even in the most basic hotel. I phoned the front desk and explained the condition of the suite and was moved to an \"executive suite\" within 30 minutes. Upon arrival to our new suite, we encountered some of the same problems in terms of cleanliness and no bedding for the pull out sofa sleeper. The pillows for the second bed were wet and once again debris on the floor, the bedroom door would not close without slamming and putting weight into it making it just as difficult to open, no soaps, a tub faucet that was falling out of the wall with a huge hole above it. I phoned housekeeping and asked for bedding and was informed that they were out of pillows, linens and blankets and had nothing to send us. I again phoned the front desk and then asked to speak with the manager on duty. I was told there was not a manager on duty and that she would send someone to another empty room to retrieve the missing bedding. Upon arrival the linens smelled of cigarette smoke. I gave up and 4 of us, slept in a king size bed - suffice it to say it wasn't a pleasant evening. The next morning I did meet with a manager (not the GM, he was on vacation), who listened, admitted the resort dropped the ball and did not charge us for the room night, and then offered to move us. Unfortunately, there weren't any rooms available, and the manager had the current room cleaned from top to bottom, reduced our rate if I wanted to stay. That said, the property while may have been renovated, it's not the caliber of resort my family is used to. The pools are small, the beach dirty... The restaurant was good. The rooms (2 that we were in) essentially had yellow paint slapped on the walls to cover up the old and a few new pieces of contemporary furniture. The rooms do not look like the pictures on the website, so I opted to move our family to a more suitable property.

Noisy plant room outside (possibly the pump for the duck pond water feature). Housekeeping was terrible - they often didn't turn up till after 4.00pm.

I was pretty worried when I read the reviews, but I figured we weren't really going to be in the hotel much anyway. It ended up that we did spend more time in the hotel than we thought, so here is my experience. To start, we arrived at 12 noon. Check in time is 4pm, but I was hoping we could unload our things and go do a tour and come back. I was told there wasn't a room clean yet, but that she would call me when the room was available. I was also surprised to find out that parking is and extra $25 a night for a 'dedicated' parking space. They take your credit card when you check in for 'incidentals' okay- no big deal, but don't use a debit card, it freezes $300. I told the front desk clerk I didn't have a credit card with that amount on it :) and she said well I can just charge you $150 on your debit card. We left, and by 4:30 were ready to go back and relax after driving all night and doing a tour at the USS Midway. (If you have kids- take them! Very cool.) Noticing I hadn't received a call yet, I called the hotel only to be told that our room still wasn't ready. ? Check in time was 4:00 I thought? Sorry- still not ready. So I arrived there at the front desk at 4:45 and after waiting 10 minutes in line (again) and they \"gave us a new room.\" The room was very nice. I was worried about the remodeling issue after reading the reviews here, but our room seemed to have already been remodeled. It had nice furnishings, a flat screen TV, new flooring, fresh paint and a nice sink area and closet space for luggage. The only part NOT remodeled was the tub, and toilet area. You could tell that was a leftover 70's project they did not get to. While clean, I don't understand why not just re-tile the tub and behind the toilet and finish the job? It was a little odd. We had a private entrance, and a semi-private patio area off the back of our room. We never heard any noise from either neighbor beside us, only from people outside walking by to the pool. I would request a 'cove room' or room on the outskirts of the property next time to avoid people walking by with noisy kids, but overall it wasn't too bad. We were happy to find out there are 5 pools at this resort, all with hot tubs. One pool is heated all the time, and the rest were solar heated for the season. The pool closest to us was very warm, and had two fire pits which they turn on at night. There was also croquet, and a very nice hot-tub. Towel service was great, they have a basket at the pool with clean towels. We would grab a few and take back to the room to supplement the 4 exact towels they left in the room. Pool hours are 9am-10pm. They have tiki torches all around the property and pool at night which was a nice touch. We went swimming at night several times after being out all day, and sat in the hot tub. Nice way to relax after walking all day. The beach was nice, nothing spectacular. It's actually an inlet, so don't think you are going to go surfing or anything. They did have a bunch of things to do at the resort (all at extra charges) but we didn't get a chance to do any of them, although the sailing looked fun. The concierge was very helpful and very nice. The landscaping was beautiful, and the location was perfect. It's literally 1 minute from Sea World and close to everything else. I was very impressed (as were my children) with the entrance. When you drive up into the property, the first impression is that of a 5 star resort. After looking at the menu for the restaurant, we decided to head down to Denny's each morning for breakfast, which was great. It's about 3 minutes away, just over the bridge. We planned ahead and had a list of dinner locations we wanted to eat at based on advice from local residents and reviews on line, so we skipped the overpriced gourmet tourist food. Overall, our stay was really great. I would stay here again, but next time I'd try to get out of that parking $25 sham, (Our 'dedicated' spot changed each night, and while across from our room, there never seemed to be an issue with finding a spot, and the place was booked.) and I'd request a room a little more private. One thing they do need to fix are the road signs. There is one major place on the property where there are two signs, one says NO RIGHT TURN and one says NO LEFT TURN, in the same spot!! The road is supposed to be one way, but I'm not sure if anyone ever just goes one way? For the price, ($98) a night, this was a great deal. One final thing- They do charge you $1.00 for a 'room tax' upon check out. What is that? Why $1.00? Wireless internet is an extra $10 a night, be warned. I didn't feel like taking the time to find out, but I thought it was kinda odd.

The room itself was a big disappointment. Shabby describes it best. It was fairly clean, but other conference attendees were complaining about bugs and mold in their rooms.

The ducks are everywhere - which I don't mind at all - but they've got to stay on top of the poop and feathers, seriously.

Take this review with a grain of salt - we typicallly stay at Ritz Carltons. We picked this hotel because we were visiting a relative who lives very close by - and it was recommended. It was inexpensive - we had some package that i think the room ended up being around 150ish a nite. The room was large - there was a big sofa as well as a king sized bed. Unfortunately the first night the heating/air unit leaked a huge puddle of water and there were ants around the bath tub. I called maintenance in the morning. We returned home late at night (1030 pm) and the heating unit had been fixed but housekeeping had never come to the room. Unmade bed and wet towels. Ugh. I called the front desk (I was furious) and they offered to send housekeeping over. I turned that offer down - we were exhausted and wanted to go to bed. I told the person i would like to speak to a manager. She said a manager would not be in until 3 PM the next day. I said \"have the manager call me so I can express my irritation with him/her. If i dont hear from him/her I will post it on trip advisor so they can read it there\". Obviously I never got a call. The ants remained our entire stay - but they were only in/and around the tub so we didnt bother reporting them again. The restaurant Baleen is nice - we had a good dinner and good servcie there on valentines day. The service at the bar (at Balleen) is BAD. We stopped by one night for a drink. No one else was sitting at the bar. We asked to see a wine list. The bar tender gave us a list and then proceeded to rearrange the liquor bottles and also fill waiters orders (from the tables). I am not kidding - 10 minutes go by and his back was to us the entire time. Finally i say \"excuse me sir - i am sorry - do we need to sit at a table to order a glass of wine?\" I said it very nicely and of course he didnt get the fact that i was being sarcastic. He said \"oh - you can order here what can i get you?\" Whatever. At the casual restaurant by the water - i went there alone for breakfast one morning. I waitied 10 minutes for a menu - 10 minutes for coffee. The omelet was very good. Had to ask 3 people to find the waiter to get the check. There was plenty of staff - i guess they were hanging out in the kitchen talking to each other. The place wasnt crowded - no excuse. The internet service at the business center is afortune. If i recall it was like 9 bucks for 15 minutes . Ridiculous. They charge 25 bucks a nite to park there. The workout room was pretty nice and not crowded. The have a multi -use pass that they dont tell you about - but it is much cheaper than the stated fee of 12 bucks a day.I think it was 35 bucks for 5 visits - and two people can share the pass.

I then requested 1 king and she told me she was going to give us a complimentary upgrade to the king with a view. We were excited!!!!!!!! The bellhop had us follow him over to a room in the 500 block. UPGRADE this was NOT. It was a very dark and tired room with ONE queen bed. I called the FD clerk from the phone in the room and she informed me that this was my complimentary upgrade.....confused by going from 2 queens to one king to a DARK DREARY ROOM with ONE QUEEN BED, I then requested to be DOWNGRAGED. She informed me that getting a king was impossible on the holiday weekend. I told her she JUST told me she was UPGRADING us to a king room with a view. She said she could not help me BUT that she could give us the room with 2 queens. I requested to SEE that room. I asked FD clerk about this room, does it have at least a view. FD clerk told me she does NOT know what the different rooms look like and I was to ask the bellhop. I turned to Keith, the bellhop, btw, who was an extremely nice young man, and told him FD clerk does not know the room and she said YOU would know the room with the 2 queens. He nodded and told me he did know this room (now in the 100 block) was newly renovated BUT no view at all, nothing, just the parking space for our car. We went and looked at the room and yes it was newly renovated. We decided to take this room AS we had plans and were meeting people and had to get going. I tipped Keith nicely as he was very helpful. Upon using the bathoom in our room, the door FELL OFF.....yes, indeed. I went outside to the parking lot and called to a hotel personel driving around on a golf cart and she called for an \"engineer\" to come fix the door which they did! There is nothing in the room. No coffee maker, no hair dryer, no water, no DO NOT DISTURB sign to hang on your door. There is a free fridge in the room, which we loved. The bed was VERY comfortable. The walls are PAPER THIN.

We did not enjoy our stay here at all. Thankfully, we only slept here. We went to OLD TOWN San Diego and that is fabulous. Many shops and wonderful homemade Mexican food.

I saw the resort on TLC's Jon & Kate Plus 8 and given Kate's stated penchant for clean, we had high expectations. The place is filthy. The grounds are neglected. There are potholes in the crazy roads that take you around th resort. The rooms are dark, dingy, old, tattered. We had a ferrell cat sitting outside our door on arrival. It was just yucky. We were taken aback by the amonia/urine smell as we entered the lobby to check in. That was the first clue but we decided to proceed. The first room we were given was in front of the main pool with a sandy beach (why this is necessary given their private beach is beyond me. It just makes the pool a dirty, sandy experience). The bathroom had been updated but the floors were dirty with hair and sand, the rest of the room was painted a brash yellow and the furniture - which they call 'distressed' looked like it came from Walton's mountain. The tv was an old 36\", there was no coffee pot in the room (you have to schlep to an outdoor vendor cart in the morning to get coffee), and the smell of mold was overwhelming. They graciously offered to move us. I have nothing to say about the staff we encountered. They clearly know that they are the only thing that would keep a guest at the facility. So, we felt as another family did that they try hard to be pleasant. The next room was larger but overall in worse shape. The yellow paint must have been a bargain because it is everywhere. We were afraid to walk on the carpets in bare feet so we put on socks. We put a towel on the floor of the tub so we did not have to touch the dingy, dirty bottom. The black on the socks was something I had never experienced anywhere. But it was the hair on the bathtowel and the bugs we found on the bath curtain that had us spend a day of our vacation in Paradise visiting other area hotels. There are great resorts nearby and they were a better value. We stayed in Torrey Pines and LOVED it. The hotel is going to undergo renovation but I would suggest that the housekeeping and grounds staff will not likely be renovated. So, if you get in early ... right after the renovation, your experience may be much different. (Though the pictures of the renovation showed that they were keeping the yellow paint which tells me they will not be truly rehabilitating the place but rather putting in new furniture.)

I will post pictures too at a later date, I took a lot of pictures of the place just for TA. So here's the (long) review: I booked my family (2 adults and 2 children) into the Paradise Point Resort in March 2009 - I came across their website through my searches for beachfront properties in San Diego, and there was a 48 hour online sale ($207 a night for a bayside 1br bungalow suite). It seemed like a great deal, especially with a full bay view, and a great location, so I booked it right away. The website showed a beautiful resort and rooms. Then I started reading the reviews and got worried, but I was still getting a really good price for a bayview room. I called the resort to ask some questions and raise my concerns about what I had read in the reviews. I called the 1-800 number, the reservations desk forwarded me to the concierge (thinking I wanted to ask questions about activities at the resort). The concierge told me that he would get the manager to call me back and talk to me - the manager (Joe) called me within 10 minutes. I expressed my concerns about the reviews I read (cleanliness, bugs, condition of rooms), he told me that while the rooms are older, the rooms were clean. I asked about the parking costs and he reduced it from $22 a day to $12 a day. I asked a few more questions and felt comfortable with his responses. We stayed at Paradise Point Resort from March 12 to March 19. I've tried to put all the details that we experienced while staying in this resort in this review, so it's really long... We arrived in the evening, around 8:30pm. When we arrived, there was one person at the front desk, and the lobby was empty. He was courteous and friendly and checked us into our room. He also gave me a card (it was a birthday greeting card from the resort, I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday when I called to ask questions). The front desk clerk (Jarrod) mentioned that the manager (Joe) had put us in one of the nicer bayside bungalows. The bellman showed us to our bungalow (he drove a golf cart and we followed him in our rental car). He opened our door for us and helped us with our luggage. We had bayside bungalow #542 (3rd from the last one on the street). The first thing the we did was whip out our cameras and take pictures of everything so I could post it in this review :) The 1br bungalow was clean, bright and really nice. The bar/kitchen area had a mini-fridge, sink, microwave, and coffee maker with complimentary coffee. There was a side table and metal ice bucket too. All were clean and ready for use - just note that it was more of a bar area than a kitchen. There are no utensils, or cooking things, or dishes, nor do they advertise it as such - we knew what to expect, so we came prepared with disposable cutlery and dishes and paper towel. The dining/living room area was nice and open, dining for four, with a large patio window overlooking the cove, two chairs and one ottoman in the living room area, storage coffee table with some magazines on top, two side tables with lamps, and a double sofa bed. There was an older but functional tv in a cabinet with drawers in the living room, and a similar set up in the bedroom. The drawers were clean. There was a newer wall air conditioner/heater unit in the living room and in the bedroom. The bathroom was an interesting design - there were two sink areas with large countertops (one in the bedroom, one in the living room) sandwiching the toilet and bathtub which had doors on both sides so that it was accessible through the living room or through the bedroom, and there was a big closet next to each of the sink areas, with two luggage stands - we could have used more hangers, but we made do (I didn't call and ask for more). The bedroom was big, with a king sized bed (nice bedding), and small bench at the foot of the bed, night tables, digital clock radio, phone, and lamps. The sink areas and kitchen areas were well lit, the bedroom was only lit by the side table lamps, the dining room and living room had adequate lighting, and the toilet/bathtub area had dim lighting with noisy fans. Everything was clean, I did check the corners and base mouldings (from reading one of the reviews), and they could have been cleaned a little better, but they weren't filthy. The carpet was clean but older. The distressed furniture style and mismatched furniture style doesn't quite match - it doesn't match the nice granite kitchen and sink countertops, or the crown moulding and chair railing, or the bedroom linens. The toilet and bathtub are old but clean. The towels were white, we had enough for 4 - they weren't very soft and plush because they're the ribbed kind, but they looked newer. There was gel soap bars in the sink areas and an oatmeal soap bar for the bathtub, as well as shampoo, conditioner, and something else (either lotion or body wash). Outside the front door we had a great view of the bay, and we had two outdoor chairs and table. The buildings are older, but we felt pretty good walking into our unit and checking it out. While we were taking pictures, we received a phone call. It was a clerk from the resort, welcoming us and asking whether everything was to our satisfaction. We mentioned that one of the bedroom lamps needed a new lightbulb, and within 5 minutes a maintenance man came and replaced the bulb. The sofabed is not very padded and you can feel every spring in it - it sagged in the middle a little, too - when I had asked the manager about it when I called the month prior (I saw some reviews mention how uncomfortable the sofabed was), he did mention that they could bring something to pad it more for us if we wanted. I would have called to ask for that, but the kids didn't once complain about it, slept well throughout the entire trip, and the only complaining was more about who was hogging more of the bed. I don't know how they slept on it - I tried it out just to see, and there was no way I would have had a comfortable sleep on it - but it worked for them. Our king sized bed was really comfortable, I slept really well all week. Bugs - I did find a centipede crawling on the air conditioning unit in the bedroom on our first evening, but we didn't see any other bugs in the unit until after our 3rd day there. It isn't surprising, though - by that time we had walked on the beach and tracked in some sand, we were using the kitchen area and had fruit and food items there, and we bought firewood to use in the firepits in the evening and they were inside behind the front door - plus, when housekeeping comes to clean, they leave the door open because they leave their cart outside while they clean. All in all, in 7 days, we saw 1 centipede, 3 spiders, and around 30 ants - the first time we saw some ants on the ceiling in the kitchen area (after day 3) - I left a message for housekeeping about it and they cleaned the walls, ceiling, floors, etc (it was pretty evident that they did). the next couple of days there weren't that many ants, just a straggler here and there, but then my kids found a bunch of them crawling on the floor in the closet where we kept all our shoes - which is why I suspect that we tracked them in with our sandals and slippers from the beach. I left a message for housekeeping to please clean the closet areas, and they did. Usually I'm quite phobic about bugs, but these were tiny little ants and they didn't really bother me - the spiders were small house ones. The kids actually enjoyed finding the ants in the closet. Our unit was a short walk to the nearest firepit on the beach in the cove, so it was a bit of a chore to lug the heavy patio chairs to and from the firepits as well as the firewood and supplies, but it was better to be where we were because it was a quieter unit being closer to the end and not being directly in front of the firepits and beach. We bought our firewood from the nearest Von's (the Island Market was selling firewood at just over double the cost of Von's), but we bought the Smores kit from the Island Market for $22 because it included the long wood sticks to cook the marshmallows. We enjoyed an open fire for three of the nights that we were there - the kids had fun playing on the beach in the dark and making Smores. They even caught some tiny baby fish or shrimp (not sure if these were baby grunions) the size of the eye of a needle when they scooped up water from the shoreline. We didn't have a problem securing the closest firepit on all three occasions, even though the entire resort was booked (and the firepits technically are public use). Each unit only has 2 patio chairs, so I called housekeeping and asked them for two folding chairs - the fellow who came couldn't find any but brought me two conference type chairs to use - they were just fine, and we kept them for the entire trip to use out on the beach. Our unit was also directly in front of the tennis courts and bike rental place, so we just walked across and rented a quad bike for just over half an hour and biked around the resort - the kids really enjoyed that. We used the main pool once, in the evening - there's not much lighting, and to me the pool didn't seem very warm, I was freezing, but my kids didn't seem to have a problem and happily swam about for over an hour. We did find one of the filters had come off and notified one of the maintenance crew. I didn't use the hot tub because there were a bunch of young adults using it (being spring break), but it seemed really nice. We got to the main pool by calling the front desk and asking them to send a cart over to our unit - it arrived in just 2 minutes. The walk from our unit to the pool wasn't really far, but in our slippers and suits at night it was better to hitch a ride. We also got a ride back from the pool. When we were dropped off my door key card stopped working, luckily we were able to flag the cart driver to let us into our unit - the next day we got new key cards. I called to ask for robes, and they brought us two large fluffy robes to use (only one size, XL), they were really warm and comfortable but they were really old and showed their wear. We hung out on the beach in the cove for one day for a couple of hours. The kids had fun playing in the sand and exploring the rocks down the way, looking for little crabs. The sand did have a lot of broken sea shells, and my daughter found a piece of broken glass, but other than that everything else was fine - the kids were running around the beach barefoot and didn't seem to have any problems. It was really nice being so close to the beach and cove from our room, we had leisurely breakfasts looking out at the view every day. SeaWorld is just a two minute drive from the resort. We decided to walk the distance - it just seemed so silly to be so close and drive two minutes to pay another $10 in parking and then have to walk in from the parking lot. My kids are 10 and 6 - and with a bag full of lunch, snacks and water, and a bag with warmer clothes for the evening, we walked from the resort, across the little bridge on Ingraham Road that separated the resort from SeaWorld, and up to the front of SeaWorld - it took us 15 minutes door to door each way. The walk was actually really nice because we walked pass Ski Beach and park, took in the view, we got to look down at some boats and fishermen when we were walking across the bridge, as well as some birds, and before we knew it we were there. On the walk back, we chatted about all the things we saw at SeaWorld, and it really made the time pass quickly. There's a view tower near the lobby and pool, we went up there on our last day, you can't really see much through the bars at the top, but on each stair landing you can get a good view of the pond and the pool. The spa is next to the main pool, the treatment costs are really extravagant, we didn't try any. We did not try out their restaurants since we bought food to eat in, and also ate out of the resort. We didn't have time to try out the mini golf, either, but we saw a lot of people out enjoying it. We also saw people enjoying the tennis courts, too. We checked out early in the morning, there was one person at the front desk, the lobby was empty again, and she printed out my receipt and that was it - she didn't ask me how my stay was, but was friendly and courteous. All in all we had a fabulous stay, all the staff were friendly and helpful and met our needs every time, housekeeping cleaned our room well every day and met all our requests (extra towels, extra coffee). I can only comment on the 1br bayside bungalow that we got (room 542) - and although it does show its wear in places, some parts of the room were updated and the overall atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing, and it was very functional for us. I'm really happy that we experienced this resort and even happier that our experience was one of the good ones. One note - as much as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and experience at Paradise Point Resort, I would say we got our money's worth (based on the price we paid) - I wouldn't have stayed there for full price, and after looking at the rest of the resort, I definitely wouldn't stay anywhere but in a bayside 1br bungalow - the whole point was to have the view and the beach, the other areas seemed gloomy and backed onto parking lots, roads, and other units. And I agree that the parking fee is unnecessary and should just be incorporated in the cost of the room, but I was satisfied with a discounted rate, better than nothing! I also think that they should just have a shuttle to SeaWorld, it's sooooo close!", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cParadise it is not!\u201d", "Author": "SL01", "ReviewID": "UR38393375", "Content": "We stayed at Paradise Point Spa & Resort Aug 14-16, 2009. .

The Bay is dirty and is never cleaned, so all the crap from the bay gets washed up on shore and is just left there. There is no way the children could have played on the sand.

The pull out sofa bed in the living room was broken and it was the most uncomfortable night's sleep we've ever had (had to sleep on it with one of the children). The bath tub and bathroom itself were so outdated it wasn't even funny. We had a wet bar in the living room and the sink drain was rusty and disgusting.

If you are looking for more food for your buck or a bigger menu, I do recommend walking over the bridge to the Blue Pearl Restaurant on Dana Landing. The one down point is location. Everything is a cab ride away - restaurant, beaches, etc. But I think San Diego as a city is really spread out in general. Because we were a party of 5, to many to fit in a regular taxi, we had to call for a shuttle every time we wanted to go anywhere. I recommend utilizing the resort's private beach.

The girls at the Front Desk are exceptional. Prior to our arrival I had the pleasure of talking to Renee, I was very concerned about all the negative reviews I was reading and she was very honest and assured me that we would have a great time, and WE DID.... Thank you Renee you're the BEST!!!! We were then escorted to our room, full of all this negative anticipation from the reviews we read we pleasantly surprised. Our room had a King size bed, a sofa with a pull out bed, a desk, Granite Counter tops in the Bathroom with two sinks, a tub/shower with a new shower curtain (not like we read that they were old and smelly) with a cloth interior shower liner which I personally prefer so you don't get attacked by the plastic ones, an in room safe, and iron and ironing board, plenty of closet space, a small refrigerator, and no one on top of us since they are all single story units which is great... but NO COFFEE POT in the room... :-( We had a front patio and the other rooms on either side of us had rear patio's which was nice when you sat outside you had some privacy and so did your neighbors, we did NOT ever hear anyone else from the other rooms and we did have neighbors. We were in the Orchid section which had a nice view of Mission Bay, and we even had the opportunity to see a SKUNK, wow they are beautiful...but then we went in our room :o) We chose to use the smaller pool which was right around the corner from our room, it was nice and quiet with a beach entry, towels are available at the pool for your use, there is a hot tub as well as torches and fire pits for evening relaxing. This Resort is amazing the landscape is something else, the landscapers have some job to keep this place so immaculate, every day they are vacuuming the streets, blowing out the falling leaves, trimming the shrubbery, what a job and it shows, it's truly beautiful. We were very close to Sea World if you were a walker you could even walk it, but we drove it's just over the bridge, we didn't eat in any of the restaurants or got to the Spa, what was I thinking?, so we can't tell you much about them other than they look nice from the outside. We had 2 minor problems, someone took our parking space and since they are assigned we were concerned about parking, the Front Desk immediately offered us alternate parking, the other problem was one day we were not provided towels, let me tell you in less than 5 minutes someone was at our door with warm hot towels. The Staff is exceptionally helpful and attentive to your every need. The one thing that we did not care for was the $22.00 per night parking fee, personally I think that's a lot $10-12.00 would be acceptable to me but every hotel is doing it so you can't get away from it, just hope you don't have a parking spot near the sprinklers. Pack your bags, go and have a great time and by the way, someone posted a photo of a piece of furniture that looked like it was painted and the paint was peeling off, well the motif of the hotel is that distressed look so it's suppose to look like that. I was told the resort will be going through a complete overhaul in the Fall I can't wait to see it after that....

The check-in procedure was easy and everyone was very friendly.

But who stays in their room? and so we decided not to say anything. A couple of hours later after walking the beautiful grounds, I decided to ask for a room switch. They gave us the choice between 2 rooms and we took the 2nd room, as it was the least shabby and the carpet was mostly clean. It actually had a nice feel. When I asked the front desk gal for the switch, she did say the property is due for an overhaul in September. That made me excited!! I'd come back after a major renovation!!! We ended up going to Baleen, the onsite restaurant, for dessert later that night...very good. And ordered room service the next morning...not so good. No flavor to the omelettes, eggs, potatoes, toast. The 35-40 minute window took an hour. Busy because of Mothers Day I'm sure. Bottomline: The resort is in a perfect location and is gorgeous.

After viewing the resort's website, my expectations were high, as we booked an ocean view suite and our brother and sister in law with their beautiful little girl booked a room near the lake. Driving into resort it almost felt like we were in Hawaii. The greenery, the lakes, the fire torches gave perfect touches to this small 'paradise' so close to home. Upon checking in we were given our key to a little bungalow on the beach, Room 541, and a certificate for complimentary desert at Baleen, a restaurant on premises. The room was towards the end of the resort and had an amazing view of the ocean. There were two lounge/beach chairs in front of the door and ducks roaming around. My son definitely enjoyed looking at them. The room itself was average. It had a bedroom with a King size bed that was comfortable and sheets were very clean. There were connecting bathrooms with two sink areas sharing a shower in the middle. The shower showed signs of wear and tear; however, the water pressure was excellent. Clean towels were also provided. The living room area had a pull out couch, two arm chairs, a futon, a small round table with 4 chairs and a small kitchenette with a sink and a microwave. Overall condition was average, but clean. When we first walked in there was a smell of moisture, however, once we opened the door and let some fresh air in and sprayed Fabreze, the smell was no longer noticeable. Our first night there we decided to have dinner at Baleen, a restaurant on premises serving above average priced food. The staff at Baleen were very accommodating, especially with our two babies - high chairs were provided. The food was a little disappointing. I had ordered a salmon dish, but it had a weird BBQ sauce and another flavor I couldn't put my finger on. The server gladly exchanged my dish to Seared Ahi Tuna - it was finger lickin' good. Other people in our party ordered Rib eye steaks, Chilean Sea bass and Lobster Tails - they were satisfied with the portions and taste. We ordered our desert to go and enjoyed it back in our suite. It was chilly that weekend, but the fresh air was very crisp and refreshing. The next morning everyone in our party decided to order breakfast in and enjoy it with the view of the ocean. This was perhaps the worst and the most disappointing service me or anyone in our party has ever received. All of us pretty much ordered egg dishes (how hard is it to make eggs?). It took us 4 phone calls and an hour and 15 minutes to track down and receive our breakfast. When the breakfast finally did arrive it was cold and missing butter for our toast and a large pot of coffee (they did deliver the creamer). We called the room service and spoke with Patricia number of times regarding the condition of our breakfast and the missing items. SHE offered a refund and we accepted. The missing items never arrived and we decided to let them know at which point she stated in a not-so-pleasant-customer-oriented tone that 'were were the ones who requested a refund and shouldn\u2019t be getting the rest of the items\". This was absolutely not true and simply an unacceptable way to deal with customers. Although we did receive our money back, it wasn't what we were looking for. We wanted a nice, relaxing weekend with good service but it was cut short after our breakfast incident. We checked out right away with disappointment. I MAY recommend this to a friend, but definitely not the room service. I have placed a phone call to the Service Manager, but have not received a call back.

The location is fantastic - only minutes from great SD beaches, minutes from Sea World, minutes from the airport (which is noticeable when the planes fly over during the day). But it's an interior part of the bay, so the beaches at the resort itself are a bit stagnant - no waves, and it was slimy when we were there. The concierge recommended the perfect seafood restaurant with a kid-friendly menu. Next time we go, we'll try the miniature golf and the croquet, and maybe check out the bike rentals. We didn't do the s'mores special (the firepits are on the resort's beaches), but even though it's pricey, it was tempting anyway. We ate breakfast at Barefoot, out on the deck, and it was typical hotel breakfast fare at typically expensive hotel breakfast prices. They're pretty good about controlling the birds out there, and hotel staff were feeding the fish in the pond by the restaurant, and let our kids help - which was probably the highlight of their stay. Oh yeah, and they charged us $22 to park there, which I thought was a bit rough considering that the rooms are scattered all over the place, not in one big building. Overall, they try hard and I can't think of a place I've stayed outside of Disney that is more kid-friendly than here.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced and undervalue - beautiful spot, but that is it!!\u201d", "Author": "Annjudith", "ReviewID": "UR26999178", "Content": "Never have I had to pay $22/day to park in front of my motel room!

The furniture looked quite used (even if they're trying to replicatate an antique look) and the walls were dirty and scratched.

Not the case. They tried to charge me 10.00/day for internet use, and when I stated I was supposed to get free internet due to being a conference attendee, I was told this was not the case because I had booked through a third party (Orbitz). I had to go to the conference staff, and they did eventually get me free internet. I had their basic \"garden\" room. My room was OK--I had some trouble sleeping due to the bright light outside my door (covered by a somewhat thin curtain). And noise carried very easily from adjacent rooms, so much so that I could hear other people's conversations. Bring earplugs. The resort itself is pretty with several pools, and you can take a nice walk along the beach around the resort. At night I found the lighting to be poor in certain areas of the resort, which could be an issue for elderly. The food we had for lunches at the conference was delicious. I ate most of my meals after conference hours at the Barefoot Bar and Grill, which had pretty decent food, although somewhat pricey and not a lot of healthy options. I was able to use the fitness center for free (but like other people have said ,their usual charge is 12.00). The fitness center is actually halfway decent, with 4 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, and 2 stairmasters, along with freeweights and some weight machines. I really wonder how much they stick to their policy of charging 12.00 to use the fitness room because most days I just walked right in and no one asked me anything. I did treat myself to an Indian Scalp massage and hand and foot massage at the Spa, which I had heard was good. I was somewhat disappointed--my massage was mediocre at best, and $150 for a total one hour mediocre treatment seemed to add salt to the wound. My massage therapist's name was Jesus, so I would try to book someone else if you go to the spa. The concierge in the hotel lobby was extremely helpful and friendly.

We were a bit suspicious when the bellhop that drove us in a golfcart to the suite simply said that we were in a \"big room.\" Right he was. Their executive suites, as it turns out, double as meeting rooms. You first walk into a big meeting room - with a collapsable wall that separates another \"executive suite.\" In that room, there is a small dingy couch about 20 feet from a really small tv, a very small table and a couple of chairs.

We are a family of 5 with 3 boys (7,5,2). We booked a Garden Suite the day before we left as the rates drop significantly to clear inventory. They were also running a special with increasing discounts the longer you stayed. When we arrived we were upgraded to a larger and newer Executive Suite. Read the somewhat conflicting reviews about it but am glad to say we had a wonderful time. We never left the property.

The main pool has a beach with real sand that the boys loved. And the grounds are beautiful. It really does feel a lot like being in Hawaii. There are plenty of activities and they're all quite reasonable (bike, boat and kayak rentals), and there's a very convenient market on premises for child essentials like milk. Bring your own firewood though, they charge a lot for firewood. The spa is first rate. The beach is great for younger children since it's on a lagoon and there are no waves. It's more like a lake. The Barefoot restaurant is a bit pricey for the kind of food it serves, but it beats driving off property. The fish and sharks in the surrounding pond are a definite plus, especially if you buy the food to feed them from the market. Seaworld is literally right around the corner, but a bit far for walking.

When we checked in with another couple at 3:30pm the suite itself was available but not the 2nd bedroom, which was not available until after 5pm. The 2nd bedroom only had access to the suite via the 1st bedroom. Otherwise, you had to walk around the outside of the building. The suite was not close to the Ballroom, you had to walk the entire length of the row of condos via the drive and then hike through the parking lot. The suite had a kitchenette, but it was not furnished with any dishware or towels or any pots, pans, utensils. I had to call housekeeping to get glasses and cups and dishware. I had to go buy papertowels and dishwashing soap and other accessories. It did come with a small microwave, undercounter frige (no ice cube tray) and coffee maker. Housekeeping was very accommodating but only brought items specifically requested, including 2 hand towels to use as dish towels and wash cloth. I also requested maintenance come to replace the air filter. The dust clogged the filter and hung down from the ceiling mounted air vent in long tendrils. The flow of A/C was hampered by the clogged filter. Maintenance never did come onsite during our weekend stay. The suite fronted onto a lagoon that while quaint did not look well maintained and had newspaper floating in it. After visitors commenting on the newspaper, I found a branch lying on the ground and fished out the newspaper. The room itself was comfortable albeit dated. The bathtub was badly cracked and the porcelain had peeled off the interior, but they tried to hide most of it with a plastic mat. Lights were dim everywhere. No hooks for towels, just one towel bar over the toilet in the water closet. One annoyance was returning to the room at 11pm after the wedding only to find neither my nor my wife's keys worked. They worked at 6pm and were not placed next to any item that would have cancelled the programming. Had to call the lobby via my wife's cell phone to have them send out new keys while standing outside the room. The charge for parking was exorbitant - $22 per night for each car. There is one parking space per room. I had to park the 2nd car in the neighboring parking lot and hoof it to the room. No reason for the charge when parking is free during the day to guests? The suite cost more than $600 per night and the extra bedroom was $400. Far too expensive for the quality of the property.

Overall, it's a nice place and very convenient to Sea World, but the place is just crying out for some renovations. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, but the rooms feel old and dilapidated. We originally had a Lanai Garden room with a King bed and a sofa bed. It felt very run down, old, small and although the room was clean, it just felt a little dirty. Definitely needs some updating. My kids (ages 10 & 7) complained (rightfully so) that the sofa bed mattress was really thin and uncomfortable. It was pretty worn out. I contacted the front desk and they were very helpful. We were moved the next day to a different Lanai room with two Queen beds which was much larger too, but not any better as far as the run down feeling. Nonetheless, we were a lot happier in the new room. Staff was extremely helpful, really went out of their way for us and were very friendly. A few other observations: -We ate at their Barefoot Bar & Grill for dinner and again for lunch. Service was really slow at night and a little better at lunch time. Food was a bit overpriced and the quality was sub-par, particularly for the price. The nearby restaurants in Mission Beach are much better and a lot more reasonable. -We rented a paddle boat and a motorboat from the marina and they were fantastic. Really helpful and the prices were reasonable. -We went to the \"Pro Shop\" to play tennis and found the courts to be pretty run down; the tennis rackets available to be borrowed were a joke. Old, beaten up, too small and in horrible shape. I think they were paddle tennis rackets. Also, the ping pong table was gone, so we couldn't do that either. -The main pool has a beach which is cool and it was pretty easy to get a drink. We were there in August - high season - and the pool was pretty clean and not very crowded. We got 4 chairs for the family pretty easily, which says a lot about the place. Two thumbs up for having lots of chairs at the pool. The other outlying pools were also relatively uncrowded and were great for kids because they are pretty shallow. -Proximity to Sea World was great. If you don't count waiting in line to pay the $12 to park at Sea World, you're no more than 5 minutes from the front gate. Unless you stay in a Beachside room, just try to plan on being away from your room as much as possible, so you're not bothered by the tiny size.

The landscaping is great - beautiful plants and flowers, lovely beach areas, the pools were well maintained and very attractive, the lagoon areas had lots of birds, paths were maintaned well. Our bathroom was great and looked refurbished. The bedding was spotless, but the rest of the furniture was shabby and chipped and the walls were scuffed. There were stains on the carpet, but they had been hoovered and it was generally clean. Our room didn't smell, but the kids room did smell musty. We suffered what other reviewers have mentioned - our rooms were not ready when we arrived at 5pm! The second room was not ready until 6.30pm, an hour and a half after check in - though in their defense they immediately and without us asking gave us $100 on the room to go and have a drink whilst we waited, but it is frustrating when you've had a long journey. As others have said the parking fee is a bit cheeky and not needed when a room is so expensive. The restaurant food ( Barefoot grill place) was fine, but again, they let themselves down. The outdoor furniture hadn't been treated, so the legs of the chairs and tables were rotting and the seats needed sanding and re-varnishing. The second day, all of the waiting staff had dirty uniforms at breakfast - there's no need for this and the manager should be looking out for this sort of thing.

We usually stay at the Hilton Resort and Spa in San Diego. It was pretty booked up, so we tried something new and I don't necessarily think the Hilton is the gold standard in hotels, but it sure beats PP. Paradise Pointe just wasn't our speed. If they're going to charge $400+ for a basic room, they need to step it way up on the condition of the hotel and the details. I gave it a 3 -- some things were above average and others way below. I would stay at the Hilton for the $ before we stayed here again. Coincidentally they're both owned by the same company now. Positives: Location: very close to Seaworld, easy drive to all beach cities. Beach is \"private\" and pretty nice. h20 sport rental -- boats, jet skis, etc. Shark pond for kids. Gorgeous grounds -- very lush. We were given a credit for inconvenience and other issues -- see below. Shampoo and conditioner was very good. Good h20 pressure in shower. Bell men and staff were helpful, gracious and courteous, save for the kids club debacle. Neutral: We were woken up at 6:30 am every morning by maintenance, but hotel tried to make good with a discount. Food at the Barefoot restaurant was very average and expensive -- $15 + for very average eggs benedict. Limited menu. I didn't dare try Baleen for fear of being disappointed. Service was really good for one meal and then terrible the next -- we waited for 50 minutes for a club, burger and some soup and several other tables that were seated/ordered after us were served more complex meals first. $4 for kids pancakes wasn't too bad. We stuck to a couple of our favorite offsite restaurants for dinner, including the Crab Catcher. Rooms were very average for the price. Nothing luxurious and no view -- peeling paint in the shower, but linens were ok and beds were pretty comfy. Negatives: Main pool was disgusting -- we never used it. Dirty bandaids, food debris and ZERO visibility. Lots of extra people at the resort who had families/friends there and hung out on the beach around the firepit. Felt like Simpson family camping. We were looking for something a little more upscale than folks parking their SUVs with jetskis on the lawn in front of our room and inviting their extended families for a beerfest at the \"free\" beach. Kids club -- this is a service they offer and one of the reasons we chose the hotel. It was booked the first night and they told us we could call back the next day to book for the 2nd day. When we called the next morning, we were told we should have booked the night before because they didn't have anyone to watch the kids because we hadn't booked 24 hrs. in advance.

We just finished a two night stay at Paradise Point. It was my husband, our 14 yo daughter and me. First of all, we stayed in a Junior suite. This is a little pricier than a standard room but it is a larger room with a sitting area, a tiny kitchette area and a very nice bathroom arrangement. When I originally booked in early March the Jr Suite were pretty expensive so I decided to settle for the standard room. However I kept checking prices and the suites came down in price so I changed my reservation to the Junior Suite. The main reason I love Paradise Point is because our room backed up on to a lovely shaded green belt. We had a small patio with chairs. There was a pond near us and every morning I would drink my coffee, read the paper and sit on the patio while ducks would meander by. I just found it peaceful, tranquil, lovely and exactly what I look for in a vacation rest. I will agree that the rooms aren't 5-star quality. But this is a very old place and what the rooms are, is clean and comfortable. They are freshly painted and the decor is 'shabby chic' or maybe they are just shabby (?) but I really had no complaints. The room was clean, the bathroom was very nice with double sinks and granite countertops. The bed was comfortable and I slept wonderfully. My only real complaint was there were no instructions with the coffee maker. The first day I didn' use nearly enough water. The second day I figured it makes about 6-8 cups. I probably could have called to find out. We played the 18 hole putting green, ate at the Barefoot Grill and my husband and daughter rented a jet-ski and jet-skied around Mission Bay. We all relaxed a lot and in a very beautiful setting. I am a person who reads hotel reviews religiously, am very picky about where I stay and really thought twice about Paradise Point based on some of the reviews. But I think it comes down to what you really want. I've had San Diego vacations where we've stayed Downtown in a high-rise with all the moden conveniences and walked the Gaslamp up and back and took in a baseball game. Tons of fun. And I had this vacation where I sat on a patio, fed the ducks, did the daily crossword, enjoyed an absolutely beautiful parklike setting and just relaxed. Both were great vacations and both cost about the same. San Diego isn't cheap for any quality hotel but for what Paradise Point is, it is unique and we will definitely go back.

We even left some things in the room, called from home, and they're shipping our stuff right away. (I didn't expect to see that stuff ever again.) Although housekeeping did not make us happy when, on our first night there, we found there was no bedding on the pull out sofa our daughter was to use. Housekeeping showed up 1 1/2 hrs later with sheets only. Then two ladies soon arrived with the pillows and blankets and made the bed for us. Thank god they didn't just drop the stuff leaving me to do their job and make the bed myself. This whole misstep kept our 6 y/o up much later than we'd planned. Not bueno. The room - all the rooms are spread out around this large property, like little bungalows. That can be nice/cute but it results in a whole bunch of walking to get anywhere. And due to the bayside location and inadequate ventilation, there's a severe musty smell which permeates the whole place, especially your room. But the bed was okay and the bathroom clean and adequate. The lovely wife had a problem with the half dozen or so spiders she killed. I think her bigger problem was with the ones that didn't show themselves and take their punishment like good arachnids should. We only ate at the casual Barefoot cafe, for breakfast. Pricey ($3.50 for coffee). After ordering oatmeal w/brown sugar and pancakes, it took us a long time to flag down a server to bring us the brown sugar and some syrup for the pancakes. It's very annoying when everyone at the table has to wait and watch their meal get cold while someone else is waiting for something that should have been there before the hot food was ever served. Ducks and birds all over the place. could be considered cute. But duck poop all over the joint. The lovely took a nap in the room, left the door open due to musty odor.

I thought Sea World would be fun and looked at around 15 hotels in the SD area including Gas Lamp district. When I came across Paradise Point I was excited that they had the duck ponds, as my daughter loves ducks. HOWEVER, I started to read the less than favorable reviews and became very concerned. I called the hotel and asked a bunch of questions. The agent on the phone was exceedingly helpful and I drilled her with questions. She satisfied my interest and I took the leap of faith. Great Decision! Amalie loved seeing the ducks. My schmoozing of the agent resulted in a very nice room upgrade at no cost. I expressed a bit of angst at the $22 car park charge, not that I can\u2019t afford it but one principle, and they did something nice for me with that. There were other unexpected perks at no charge\u2026and clearly no guarantee you will get the same, but I could not have been happier as my daughter loved the place. Also, they have chairs comfortably placed throughout the grounds to sit and relax, nice gardens, very nice staff and a miniature golf course we did not get a chance to use. The beach was nice for all of us as were the pools. The Spa looked impressive but no time for that with the toddler being the focus.

The room next to our hotel room is a HouseKeeping supply room, all night a long squeaky sound would sound off and on. There is no parking option other than the one assigned by your room, but since there is no option the hotel adds $22 a night for parking. (What is the other option????????) The area is very confusing with a even more confusing map. Few signs are posted to even give a person a clue. First night I found out the outside porch light did not work, called the front desk and was assured someone could fix it the next morning. (Thanks for the added security for the first night.) Then I also realized this is the first Hotel I have ever stayed in that does not offer a deadbolt or inside lock, not to mention my door did not even shut securely and since we were at the back of the Resort (in nowhere land) it made me feel very unsafe. The next day I applied the \u201cService Please\u201d sign on the door to receive Housekeeping for the day. (The Housekeepers get there supplies and everything two feet from my room), returning at 5PM my room had not been touched. Day two of trying to get online, called for a computer expert. I was sent a Man who came with a cord for the dataport.

His response was for me to call the front desk, maybe they could help. (Was this ther main IT Man?????) The pool closest to our room was the Meadow pool, night two, it was completely dark, my daughter was swimming, and I could not even see her in the dark to see if she was ok. One of the maintenance men drove by in a cart so I stopped him and asked why is the pool so dark, and if it had no lights why was it open until 10PM. ----No joke ----for the next hour I sat watching four employees walk around the pool with flashlights clueless.

We called a reservation service from a courtesy phone at the airport and were referred to Paradise Point for $149 per night. I was a little nervous because I'd never heard of the place and the rate seemed cheap on the weekend of the Rock N Roll Marathon when many properties were sold out. The property itself is beautiful...tropical landscaping, lagoons, a pretty main pool, a neat observation tower, lots of outdoor seating areas. It felt like Hawaii. Our room was satisfactory. Nothing special but nothing to complain about especially at $149 per night. We had plenty of hot water. I'd agree with others however that the A/C sounded like a 747 about to take off. We stayed in a little bungalow on the bay and we were just steps from the beach. Fire pits on the beach were a nice touch. This was a great place to be with kids. The beach access was super. There were fish and ducks to feed. Walking paths were nice. There was a movie at the pool in the evening. We used an outside pizza delivery service right to our door. Disadvantages: Like so many other reviews, our room was not ready at 3:00 pm when we arrived. They said they'd call but didn't. We didn't get into our room until 4:30. There was no room service menu in our room. Our portable crib requested at check-in didn't come until almost 7:00. The restaurants were expensive and not really geared to someone with kids. Golf carts to get you around were a nice touch but seemed to disappear after dark...and this is a place where you can really get turned around. No ammenities are really provided. I've stayed at Best Westerns that will give you a toothbrush if you've forgotten one. This place will nickel and dime you to death. As I mentioned, we were there because of airport snafus. We had no luggage. 6 diapers, a pack of wipes, two toothbrushes and a mini toothpaste set me back about $24. All that said, this seems like a great place to come with a family if you are prepared. We met many families from Orange County who come as a getaway with the kids. They bring snacks, waters and toys for the kids. They enjoy the pool, movies, beach and walking paths.

This review is for the Paradise Point Resort and Spa. \u201cOh, you\u2019re gonna love San Diego\u201d they all told us as we travelled down from San Francisco. Well I\u2019m not sure that we saw the true San Diego (given that we had a 3 night stay and both Sea World and San Diego Zoo to fit in as part of our Southern California Attraction Pass), but overall we were very disappointed. The journey down from Anaheim was hell on wheels. A 4+ hour crawl like nothing we\u2019d seen on the holiday prior to that. We got to the resort late afternoon and at first all appeared fine. The grounds are large and well maintained. I likened it to an upmarket Centre Parcs (for all the Brits reading this) \u2013 a series of bungalows with a shared front door which then leads left or right to your room. You park outside your bungalow in a number bay. The rooms were pretty weird. An eclectic mix of aged furniture of all different styles and colours, a drab kitchenette and an odd sliding door directly opposite the beds to the bathroom. There was a patio door to a small patio overlooking a large pond (no, not a pool; a green weedy pond \u2013 somewhat of a risk for young kids). Lighting was poor and hot fully functioning and the air con was a beast of a thing in the corner of the room that nearly had the place taking off when it was turned on. Our closest pool was quite small and very shallow: more suited to small kids. There were a couple larger pools on site but not exactly close at hand. The reception building was simply a place to check in and out but the staff were extremely polite and efficient. Eating wasn\u2019t easy. The location, opening hours and offering were not very appealing hence we did our own thing off-site. All in all, the brochure picture looked stunning and this was the second most expensive nightly stay after the Beverly Hilton. What with the journey down to San D and then a nervously early set off to LAX to allow plenty time, we really think we would have preferred 6 more nights in Anaheim (for the same price as our 3 at Paradise Point). If you want to spend loads of cash paying for extra sports activities on site then OK but to be honest, having had such a great holiday, Paradise Point was a big let down \u2013 definitely not paradise for us. As for Sea World, well, after Disney I\u2019m afraid it cannot compare. I\u2019ve done Sea World in both Florida and San Diego and I won\u2019t be going back. San Diego Zoo was also disappointing. Some good areas but also quite a lot of very bedraggled enclosures that were really not what I was expecting. The bus tour is useful to get your bearings but overall, the zoo is quite hard to get round and very hilly in places. Food offerings and gift shops at both attractions are poor.

Yet, the showers as well as the rooms were were spacious, quiet (stay near the adult pool), & cool, with garden views we found to be nicer than the beachfront.

Glorious tropical feel, unpretentious adorable staff, decent pools (especially the empty adult pool), perfectly fine casual restaurant by a natural \"acquarium\" where our 4 year old frolicked within a few feet of our table.

We are a couple whose two children's families also stayed. While one couple professed satisfaction with the resort (they stayed in a beachfront suite) we other two famiies felt it worn and much in need of attention. The good: Rooms were clean and ready upon our arrival. Beds were of very good quality and comfortable. The bad: Arrival: We were greeted at the spartan front reception with little or no sense of care after 'valets' ignored guests while they walked into lobby. At no time were we told prior to our arrival that there was a $21 'parking' fee for our car. When we asked if we could park elsewhere the fee was halved for 2 nights. In our room the blinds did not operate properly on one window and could not be opened. The front door outdoor light was out and we had to ask 3 times for it to be replaced. The resort is surrounded and encased by driveways and asphalt. The foliage is overgrown and borders on dangerous in areas where palm trees are in desperate need of branch trimming overhead. Pool drinks were over $10 for specialties on their menu. The area around the pool was dirty and unswept, irritating when guests were naturally barefooted. The dining room was noisy but most disgusting were the seagulls or other seabirds who were lurking ready to swoop down to your tables, even at night. One was under the table right next to our set of tables. Upon checkout two of our son's bills were placed on our bill, causing a delay while they verified our concern.

We booked at Paradise Point again because of our past great holidays there, however, now the hotel is way over priced for what you get. Over the last couple of years they've let the rooms run down. We were supposedly upgraded to a better room when we got there, however the pull-out bed our son slept on was so uncomfortable that we left it as a couch for him to sleep on the last three nights. Our garden view was of a a big tree with the highway directly behind it. This for just about 500.00 a night?? plus parking fees, plus admin tax...the size of the room was small, the amenities they provided were of dollar store quality and one night, we were given one towel to use for all three of us. We had to wait over an hour for bedding for our son the first night and one of the blankets they brought had holes in it. We travel a lot and have stayed places that were half the cost that had much more to offer. The food in the lounge was over priced, especially for the quality. Want to play on the tennis court? Don't expect to be able to rent a racket that isn't crooked. We must say thanks to the great staff at the court who must have known that it was silly to charge us 10.00 for a half an hour to play with lousy rackets-thanks to him for giving us one positive experience and allowing us to play for free. We were very saddened by our experience there as we'd returned because of our great memories. We'll be staying elsewhere next time and would recommend the same as the rest of our trip to San Diego was fantastic.

The rooms were discounted for the affair for $259.00/night + taxes + parking( $10.00/night)= $ 311/night. The resort is spread out on 44 acres on Vacation Island which is situated in Mission Bay. The cottages are spread out through out the resort and village clusters are named for flowers: Orchid, Hyacinth, Eucalyptus, etc. Some of the pricier ones are located near the water or beach and some face the ponds. There is a tennis court, basketball court, putt-putt golf in some of the villages. The main lobby is separate and located in the middle of the entrance. You pull up to the curb ( if you have your own transportation) and check in, then a bell boy will lead you by golf cart to your cottage. If you take a taxi you will be loaded into a golf cart and driven to your room. Unless there are several lined up there is a wait unti they return. If youare adventurous you can walk with your luggage. The layout is confusing at first with the one ways and turns. The business Center is in the Paradise Ballroom which is in the same area as the Lobby but not connected to it...it is another walk.Near the Ballroom is the Barefoot bar & grill ( expensive) & the Baleen restaurant( open in evening). There is the Island Market for sundries,souvenirs same vicinty as lobby. The Main pool and Spa are located next door to the Market. There are three lawns to do your wedding, the Sunset, Paradise & Lawn point. The Paradise is the nice one with cement squares in the grass so you walk on something solid. It isn't as exposed but you have the Marina view it is more than the Sunset lawn with is on the opposite side of the Ballroom and is all grass also looking out to the Marina, more exposed so a little more windy and cooler( this is March remember and at 4:30 pm). Both are accessible to the ballrooms. Lawn point is smaller and tucked in near the Marina and Barefoot grill. You will do a lot of walking to get to the Main area or call /flag down one of the many golf carts driving around. Ice machines are located in one area of the village so if you are lucky to be near it Great! If not you have to walk to it. The rooms are not that great..we had a double bed so it was slightly larger than the King. I think the theme is distressed/tropical because the furniture looked like it was made to look scuffed and old. The amoire had a decent looking Tv and a small ref next to it, below a coffee maker with just coffee, no tea. and no plug near it..you have to move it to the bathroom to plug it in. The carpet looks clean but please bring slippers or you feet will be dingy.Smelled musty had to open doorwall but was missing the screen so we just pulled it open little so nothing would crawl in. The painted wooden lanai chairs on the patio were flithy we had to scrubb them before we sat in them. We faced the pond, nice with the ducks. Door mat had grass growing from it. The bathroom was marble tiled, pretty clean, had a hair dryer, ironing board was rusty and unbalanced when you opened it. The one thing was there little ants crawling on bed, bath counter, once inwhile the ref. It would have been nice to have complimentary bottled water in the room for the price you pay for the room. There is # parking for each room. We shared a common foyer with the room next door so you had to use your room key to enter and had a doorbell for each room. I got the same comment from the others regarding their rooms. The only room i saw that was nice was the one my daughter was in but she was the bride so she had one facing the water and it was modern, painted nice, clean had a living area and kitchenette, separate bedroom, and bathroom. This was probably a suite so must be pricey. You have to like that kind of atmosphere, but it was really nothing special i must say ...for $ 300+ we could have stayed at a four star hotel and had a better room.

The grounds are beautiful. Extremely spread out. Our room-nice king bed, with couch and two extra chairs, plus a desk and chair. Also had a wood armoire with TV and mini fridge. I liked the bedspread on the bed. It made me think more of home or a bed and breakfast rather than a generic hotel bedspread. Our fridge did not work. It lacked a temperature knob and wasn't even plugged in. There was coffee left for us, but no coffee pot. I'm sure we could have asked about the fridge and coffee pot, but it really didn't matter to us. You could definitely tell that the place was old. The last night we were there, the armoire door came off one of the hinges. It was a heavy door and I didn't want it falling off the other hinge in the middle of the night. We called the front desk and someone came to take the door off completely. It wasn't something that was a quick fix because the wood of the armoire was worn and old. Again, it wasn't something that concerned us cause we were leaving the next day. We did not have a car, but from what I understand, it costs $17-$25 to park your car. ( I don't know the exact number). The bar/grill at the hotel is WAY overpriced. We didn't want to eat there, but we were starving and didn't have a choice. The gym is located in their spa. The gym cost $10 or $15 but we had a reduced rate. Small gym, but they had what I needed. All of the machines are brand new. Each bike, treadmill and ellitical had it's own tv and they gave you water, headphones and a towel. The changing room was very nice as well. The grounds are very extensive and spread out. If you call the front desk, they will send a golf cart to take you to other places in the resort. You really need a car at this resort as there is no other place closeby to walk to. I don't feel as though the prices they charge for this place are worth it. They were charging $185. Considering that you have to pay to park, are limited on the food choices and that it is old, I think you could do better in the SD area. If you could get in this place for under $150, I think it would be ok. The proximity to Sea World is outstanding and that is one positive point. There are lots of restaurants within close driving distance. One other positive point is that the meeting and banquet facilities at this place are outstanding. The rooms and the restrooms are beautiful. Also, the staff was always very friendly. So, I give the 3 circles because we had some good and some bad with our trip.

Always check the signs on the beach as the water may well not be safe for paddling. On the last visit we shared our Lanai garden Room with a family of ants (complained about but not rectified).

Upon arrival, we were taken to our room at what seemed like the farthest end of the hotel, adjacent to a main road (rooms 550-560). As we walked in the door, the rubber door lining came off the doorjamb, thus making it impossible to fully seal the door. Once inside, the room itself was freezing! It was about 63 degrees inside the room, and it was in the 70s outside. We turned the AC off and soon realized why it had been turned down so low. The room reeked of mildew. We noticed that the refrigerator was leaking and making a strange high-pitched squealing noise, so we shut it off and cleaned up the pool of water underneath it. As we were taking the top bedspread/quilt off the bed, we saw two large cigarette burn holes on it (in a non-smoking hotel). We immediately called housekeeping to get it replaced. The woman on the phone sounded exasperated, as if this kind of thing happens all the time. The staff didn't come to replace the quilt for at least an hour. Later that night, we ordered room service for dinner. The staff member who delivered the meal told us to leave the tray outside when we finished and he would be back to pick it up later. The next morning as we left for breakfast, we almost tripped over the tray and dirty dishes that were still sitting outside the door. Everything had been picked over by all sorts of animals, judging by the tracks made on the dishes, and there was trash scattered everywhere. We called room service to come pick it up. It had still not been cleared when we got back an hour later. Last, but certainly not least, there was a huge black stain in the closet. At first, we thought it was spilled coffee, until my mom placed her dirty clothes on the floor of the closet. About an hour later, her jeans were soaked. It turns out the stain in the closet was actually mildew (that explains the awful smell) from the standing water all over the floor. We complained and they offered to give us a new room and clean my mom's wet clothes free of charge. The front desk staff were very reluctant to comp us a night, even when we explained that the mildew smell had given us both sinus headaches.

We would have even settled for a 3-star experience. Not the case. First off, their website clearly states that check-in is at 4 p.m but be prepared to wait. We were in line at least 20 minutes, only to be told by a manager that check-in was \"actually between 4 and 5\" and that checking-in just meant \"checking-in, not that the room was ready\". Our room was ready an hour later and we only knew that because we came back to the lobby to inquire about what was taking so long. Second, be prepared to spend a lot of $$$ on hotel services, some of which are not mentioned on their website. Parking is $20 per night for a spot in front of the bungalow. The \"free\" mini-golf course advertised on their website is actually $10 per person. The fitness center, basketball court, volleyball court and internet are also extra costs. The Barefoot Bar and Grill prices are also extreme ($13 for a drink???). Third, we had not housekeeping during our stay. We were out of our room for at least 8 hours in the morning/afternoon and came back to an untouched room. Fourth, the bungalow we stayed in was not 4-star quality. The room had a bed and breakfast type feel to it except the bed was hard as a rock. The in-room movie would not work and when we tried to check out through the hotel's TV system, we gave up after 3 tries and a call to the front desk. I hesitate to mention the plethora of children riding rented hotel bikes throughout the many parking lots on the wrong side of the road but it is definitely a safety hazard. The hotel claims it only rents to those \"18 and older\" but this was obviously not the case during our stay.

One problem that we did have is that half of the window was not covered by a blind or heavy curtain, only a very sheer curtain, which let in very bright sunlight early in the morning and made it very hard to sleep in if you wanted to. At night you had to be careful where you stood at the bathroom sink area because you could see right in.

This is a very expensive resort $300+ and upon checking in we are told that there is a $20 per day parking fee, are you kidding me? Maybe they park your car and wash it at night? Of course not. It is dishonest for a hotel to add these kind of extra fees on top of the room charge without telling you about them when you book. There is a mini golf on site. My nephew and nieces wanted to play, surprise surprise you need to pay $9 a head for a pathetic little course right on by the road. Want to use the gym? Sure, $15 please. By the way the gym is the only nice thing in the whole property, i.e. it is new and has new equipment but it should be free, as in every hotel in the world. The rest of the place is shockingly in need of a remodel and not just a coat of paint. Our two rooms smelled horribly musty. We asked to be moved, the next two rooms were musty too but not as bad. The furniture is in bad shape, the bed covers very suspicious, the bathrooms drab, the walls paper thin and we found tons of ants in the bathroom the next morning. Our room overlooked a murky pound. The gardens are dull and in need of some landscaping. They do however mow the lawn at 7am, thank you!!

I asked if they had a family package deal for Sea World, and she said she had heard something about a package deal, but said she did not know much about it, so I should just call Sea World myself and see if they knew if Paradise had a package deal with them. She was really starting to bug me. At this point I had been trying to get a reservation completed with her for over 40 minutes but she seemed really confused. I asked her if she could please get a manager for me to speak with to find out more about their Sea World package and she sat the phone down and yelled into the other room to ask someone to yell back and tell her about the passes. I should have just cancelled at this point, but the web site had it listed as a 4.5 star resort, so I chalked it up to a poor employee. She came back on the line and said - OK, its a 2 day family splash package. It is a 2 day Sea World pass pack that includes 2 adult and 2 childrens tickets and it increases your daily rate to $259 per day over 4 days payment. I asked her if she knew what the regular rate for Sea World was and she seemed to lock up at the confusing question I possed. Begining to tire from this entire transaction, I just said OK, yea, lets do the 2 day Sea World family splash pass for 2 adults and 2 kids. About a week prior to our trip, I called the hotel just to check on everything and the long hold cycle started again - I gave it 20 minutes and just called the hotel directly and asked for the manager. Sergio got on the line and appoligized for the problems and checked my reservation to make sure it was what we had thought. Yep, we were all in, including the 2 day Sea World Splash pass. On the day we arrived, we went to the bell stand to get our tickets. He told us that it was only a 5 minute walk at the most to get to Sea World from where we were standing with our 5 and 7 year old daughters. He gave us our tickets and said to come back the following day for the other tickets as they are bar coded and once issued cannot be replaced. That seemed fine - so off we went. While the back side of Sea World is more like about 20 minutes walking and piggy backing our children, to get to the front entrance it was closer to 40 minutes of walking. Once at the gate we gave the attendant our tickets and she said that was only good to get in my husband and myself - the kids were an additional $96 - I was sure that the bellman had made an innocent error, so I kept the receipt so that I could clear it up when we returned to our hotel that afternoon. I contacted the front desk once back in my room and they said that the Splash pack was only good for 2 adult tickets 2 days, not the 2 adults, 2 children that we had been told. I was really bugged, but thought what the heck - we are here now, we'll just get our tickets and buy for the kids The following day we went back to the bell station to get our final 2 adult tickets - we were told that there we no more tickets for us, because the 2 day Spash Pack is for 2 adult tickets only - total. Non of this maked any sense what so ever. 2 days is 48 hours - family is typically 2 adults 2 children To help us through our obvious irritation, we received 4 tickets to use on their property.

Toilet and bath was shared between the two rooms. Space is larger than it looks on the website. Kitchen unit had nothing. We bought plastic bowls, dish soap and sponge, cereal, milk, snacks, and ate breakfast in the room each morning. Maid and front desk staff were excellent. However, the bungalows were old, toilets back up occasionally (water only not sewage) causing water damage to be dried out and leaving musty smell. Decore nice, modern, and comfortable but the unit just smelled and felt a bit old, musty and damp (my husband didn't think it was noticable). I guess I prefer newer construction. But what can you expect from an updated resort right on the water? Water view, beach front, and gardens were spectacular. Great central location. Casual dining on site and for room service o.k. Student thought hamburger awesome. TV channels very limited, no plug in for playstation 2. Pools seem nice. The heated one was too cold but we spent some time in the whirlpool with everyone else. Good resort for families with older kids (7-16 probably ideal), adults on their own or sharing with other couples. Less expensive room options around the site as good as the beach option. Rent a minivan. Driving is easy to all attractions. Ask the resort for a reduced parking rate for longer stays. They are very helpful and keen to ensure you enjoy your stay. Meal Tips: authentic, inexpensive mexican food at Valentinos in Mission Bay; and, fresh Italian take out back to your room at Cafe Bella, Garnet Ave Mission Bay. See all Sea World shows and consider two day pass with backstage tour. Well worth it. Loved Legoland. Both Sea World and Legoland have huge, excellent play areas for young kids. You could spend several hours at these locations with toddlers and preschoolers so bring something to read. Carlsbad shopping outlet is great and close to Legoland. The mall has a Diner that has the best milkshakes! Las Americas is even better shopping south of San Diego (quick drive). Coronado bridge and beach great. Zoo fun (avoid the petting zoo, disappointing compared to local farms). We did not go to the wild animal park. Old Town is very quiet and nice. Great mexican food everywhere. Our four year old could not follow the walking tour (too boring) but my husband and our student thought it was great. The shops have interesting art and pottery, and unique imports.

Outside the slider you have your patio with chairs and small table, then grass, then the sand on the beach, then the bay.

When our cab pulled up from the airport, the bell staff greeted us and loaded our luggage on a golf cart while directing us to check-in. The front desk staff were quite friendly to us, and the bellman who took us to our room was wonderful! We spent the whole first day exploring the resort - jellyfish season runs from February-April, so if you go any time outside that, you won't have jellyfish on the beach. We enjoyed looking at them, really. The harbor on site has rental boats, so we went out on the bay in a kayak one day and a sailboat a different day. The prices on these boats are quite reasonable - the power boats and waterski runs can get more expensive. We stayed from Monday night to Friday afternoon, so we had lots of time to look around this place (we did spend 2 full days at seaworld). The best part for my daughter really was the Barefoot Cafe - yes it is slow and pricey (I expect to pay too much at a resort restaurant, don't you?), but there is a waterfall and pond outside - the birds and fish are great, and there was even a huge lobster in there. I didn't have much company at meals because the girl kept jumping up to look at the wildlife - as did most of the kids there. If you hate kids, this is not a good place for you to eat! The staff was really friendly. I had read many reviews of this hotel before we went, so I was prepared for the grounds to be wonderful (they were) and the rooms to have some cosmetic issues (they did). Our room was really big, and the bed was comfortable. We had a coffee maker and a refrigerator - I never tested the TV as we were so busy. Room service breakfast was really quite fast! The housekeeping staff were not the best - when they saw I had used the coffee maker, they cleaned it, but forgot to leave more coffee and cups. Next day I left a note and there were no more problems. The room was clean, including the bathroom, but there was a bit of rust on the hinges, could use a coat of paint. The pools were not too crowded (this was spring break time and things were a bit more crowded on Friday when we were leaving). During the day there were lots of kids in the hot tub at the main lagoon pool, but there is an adults only pool with another hot tub if you want to avoid crowds and kids. Both of those pools are heated, as is the waterfall pool. There were plenty of towels (you are asked to leave them at the pool, so having a beach towel to wrap up in after swimming is a good idea), and the pools were as clean as any pool you are sharing with other people - better than the public pool in my town.

We could not walk throught the room from our king bed to the bathroom when the sofabed was opened. We literally had to crawl over the sofabed as there was zero floorspace to walk on. The view of the bay from our room was very beautiful; however, lots of jelly fish in the bay and on the beach (act of nature not the hotel). We enjoyed an evening campfire in the fire ring on the beach which was near our room. Campfire supplies (wood, matches, marshmellows, etc.) were pricey at the hotel store. Of the many pools, only the main pool was heated therefore it is very crowded. We had planned to play mini-golf, but it is age restricted to age 8 and older (our 4 year old loves to play). Parking is $20 per night. I found a package that included free parking and a $36/day credit at the casual restaurant. The casual restaurant is convenient, but slow and pricey. Plan to spend $50 for 2 adults, 2 kids for breakfast or lunch. Dinner is more expensive. Basic Cocktails were $10 each. Kids meals do not include beverage. Milk is $3.50. Plan to drive 10-15 minutes to other restaurants off property. Despite the prices and \"tired\" room condition, I was happy with the hotel until the last night. Our room was invaded by tiny ants! After seeing hundreds of ants, I called the front desk. They offered to come spray the room, but I didn't want freshly sprayed poison in our room as we were ready to go to sleep. The person at the front desk said they spray for ants with \"Windex\". I found this to be completely unbelievable. No other rooms were available for us to move to. Furthermore, the front desk person said that \"ants were to be expected.\" For me, the ants were the final straw. I will not return to this hotel. I have stayed in 2 other hotels in the San Diego area and never had ants. We had a great time for 2 nights, but we knew and accepted that this resort was expensive due to it's beachfront, single story accomodations (truly a different experience than staying in a multi-story hotel).

The only good thing about this was that when we complained about the cold water they took the $60 parking charge off our bill! $60 to park in the deserted lot 100 feet from our room. We were also disappointed that there was no wireless internet available. We took turns plugging into the one ethernet cable in the room (remarkably they did not charge for using the ethernet cable; perhaps they overlooked that). The room did have a great big walk-in closet, but only 8 hangers, so it did not do us much good. The decor was rustic country, which surprised me for a Southern California hotel. There was a couch and coffee table, and 2 uncomfortable wicker chairs. The doors of the large hutch containing the fridge and tv could not be opened all the way b/c they hit the footboard on the bed.

The ammenities on the grounds are laughably expensive; the spa, the workout facility, the restaurants... there were too many alternatives in nearby La Jolla to spend money on the resort. There is a parking fee of $20 per day though the front desk charged us only $10 (due to the length of our stay). Other than that we were offered nothing special (which I found a bit odd considering the nature of our visit). We stayed in the \"Lanai Garden\" (base room) for 2 nights, then paid extra the last 2 nights to stay on the beach in the \"Lanai Bayside.\" It was worth the extra $50 per night, and it took only a few minutes to coordinate, though I felt slighted having to pay - the resort was practically empty and again it would have been a nice gesture.

The two breakfasts we ate were very good and eating outside at the Barefoot Bar and Grill which overlooks the marina and the bay was very pleasant. The service was quick and the food was good. Dinner, on the other hand, was not good. The food was poor quality and the inside portion of the restaurant was dated and dingy. The tennis courts were okay. They tended to be wet in places during our stay and the squeegee didn't work properly to soak up the puddles. The net was ragged but not sagging. But the surface was good, no holes or cracks and the lighting system was excellent. The lights were done so that the ball never got lost in the glare. A good stay except for the dinner. (We had tried to eat in Little Italy, no parking. Then we went to the Gaslamp District, again no parking. San Diego needs more parking garages at more reasonable rates.)

The resort is nice, but there was one major negative that caused me to have a terrible experience. When I got to my room late at night, I noticed a terrible smell. I thought that maybe the room was a smoking room and the smell was a deodorant to mask the smell of smoke. I travel almost every week on business, so have dealt with this before. I was too tired to switch rooms that evening, so went to sleep. I had a hard time sleeping and kept waking up with a burning sensation in my throat and a bad headache. I made it through the night and felt better after I got some fresh air the next morning. I also switched rooms. After a full day at the conference and feeling healthy again, I moved into my new room. Within 15 minutes, I had the same burning and headache. It was even worse than the prior night. I ended up checking out and staying at the Hilton at the airport. The management was reasonable and didn't charge me a penalty for cancelling. Also, they told me that they use a number of chemicals in the room. Clearly, I had some type of reaction to these chemicals. It has never happened to me before in nearly 20 years of business travel, so it is something unique to Paradise Point. Be careful, especially if you are bringing young children! Other than this, the place was reasonably nice. The rooms are large, though modestly appointed. The bathroom was adequate, with a nice shower head and good water pressure, but the decor was sparse and showing some signs of age. (I don't think the tubs and toilets have been upgraded recently.)

Housekeeping arrived 10 minutes after our call for more towels and the roll away (comfortable). In room movies - can't pause and no close caption. Room service was quick and well prepared, though remember the 18% gratuity and $3.50 per delivery is added to the bill. Our Garden bungalow was quiet until Sunday morning at 8:00, my 12 year old daughter was woke by 4 screaming children. Bike rental, croquet, ping pong, minature golf ,swimming all available, as well as water sport rental. Bikes ran out quickly. Main Pool was very crowded every day, but it's the only large family pool in the resort. Watch out for extremely fast cart drivers (employees), making housekeeping and room service deliveries! My son was almost hit by one while riding his bike. They need to slow down! Yes, parking is $20.00 per day, but we had our own numbered spot, no searching for a parking spot after a full day at Sea World. We only ate at the Barefoot Grill (room service food comes from here).

The check-in staff were friendly and helpful. The room was a delight -- everything was super clean and comfy. The bathroom was great (two rooms helps) and the king sized bed was so comfortable. We did not pull out the couch as my daughter decided to sleep on it \"as a couch\" and she was fine. That also gave us more room. Breakfast at the Barefoot was really good. Service was quick and friendly. The main pool was a hit with both kids as was the Dive-In Movie night on Wednesday. This is not a hotel for young couples looking for peace and quiet. It really is a family oriented resort. There were many, many children there, and they all seemed to be having a great time. There is a lot to do, and it's not inexpensive, but if you are on vacation, splurge a little and enjoy yourselves. The resort is close to every attraction and the front desk will give you driving directions for everything.

If you are expecting a high rise building with elevators and penthouses, this isn't it. If you are expetcing the Ritz Carlton with contemporary decor and snooty bellhops, this isn't it. This hotel is it's own island located in the best location you could ask for in San Diego. Minutes from Pacific and Mission Beaches, on the same road as SeaWorld, minutes from downtown and the zoo. close to old town, seaport village, coronado island, anything you could possibly want to do in San Diego is no more then 15 minutes away. The hotel itself is goregous. It is HUGE and with exotic plantlife and flowers. There is so much to do here on the resort that you could stay for a week and never leave the hotel. from renting a jetski to lounging at one of the 5 pools, to getting an amazing massage at the wonderful spa, this place has it all. The rooms make you feel like youre right at home. The decor is friendly and inviting, the linens are the best Ive ever slept in- got the best sleep of my life in that bed. The decor doesn't need to be updated- that is how it is SUPPOSED to be. It is rustic, unique and comfortable. The bathroom is HUGE with 2 rooms- one for the double marble sink and the other for the toilet and shower area. The maid service was also fabulous. Our room was steps from the beach (which was sparkling clean despite what other travelers found) even though we only had a garden lanai. At night you could have a fire in one of the many firepits located on the beach. Everyone was friendly (including many of the people staying there) and accomodating- I truly cannot understand what people can find to complain about. I guess some people will complain no matter what. Paradise Point is truly paradise- don't listen to the people who need the toilet to be lined with gold to have a good time. I have stayed in 4 star hotels/resorts and Paradise Point is perfect for people of all ages and I will definitely be going back- it is the only place I woudl consider staying and is definitely the best place to stay in San Diego.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cI would not go back, ever--Don't waste your time or money\u201d", "Author": "jrconti", "ReviewID": "UR5506728", "Content": "Simply, it is overpriced.

Now we know why!! No one would stay if they didn't HAVE to). Recent posts on the site have it right -- Paradise Point is like an old Hawaiian hotel from the 70's. My personal opinion is, don't stay in this area at all. It's a tourist trap with a less than nice beach area. We'll never return. We love downtown San Diego and love La Jolla even more. My advice is, stay away from Mission Bay and away from Paradise Point and you'll hopefully have a better experience than we did.

Unfortunately, it faced the parking lot. We called and asked if there were any other available rooms that didn't face the parking lot (it was my birthday, yada yada...) They immediately rebooked us into another room that faced one of their many duck ponds. I thought that their signature restaurant Baleen was very good, if expensive. Their pool was crowded, but we didn't even try to go to any of their 4 additional pools because we were lazy and simply sat in the sun drinking pina coladas. I popped into the spa for one of their facials and pedicures (great experience for both my 6 year old daughter and myself). Anyway, I really liked Paradise Point. Everyone was very friendly and my family and I had a wonderful time.

The kids loved to look in the rockpool and look at all the fish swimming in it. The pools are fantastic. My kids swam here pretty much all day, and there is sand on the side of the pool, excellend for sand playing. It was wonderful to sit back, relax, watch the kids swim and sip on a (expensive) cocktail. On the downside, during peak summer periods they need to regularly clean the toilets as they get very wet, sandy and slippery. Not a nice combination. On the weekends in summer they have movie night at the pool, which my daughter just loved. Overall we had a wonderful relaxing stay, with resort prices. Perfect for kids during summer. I recommend to save your money and get a garden room instead of a bay view. You will be pretty much in the pool, not in the bay.

I explained everything to the front desk clerk and she said \"sorry..........come on by and we'll buy you lunch... but check in is 4:00. \" Long story short.............they did not charge me the $20 parking every day and they took off a charged dinner on my bill. Would I stay here again? Probably not. It is more important to me to be reassured a room when I am traveling with my family. On top of that, I should have been handled by a manager....but it seems that this happens all of the time at Paradise Point so nothing special is done. The rooms are old, just like many of the write ups say. They are very worn and could use as much attention as the grounds get. We did have a room on a little pond with ducks.

The room, nicely decorated in bright yellow and navy, was larger than most four-person rooms we encountered in California. What really stood out was the service.

Called them (on my cell, because remember, the phone was not working) for bedding for the baby. They brought 2 pillow cases?!? Bed sheets were mildewy and damp. Shivered all night from damp sheets and woke up smelling moldy. Tub was dirty, had hair in it, and tile was cracked and moldy. Furniture old, worn, and broken. No mention of $20 per night parking charge until checkout. What's up with charging for parking? Woke up to complain to the desk staff who argued with me that it was a luxury resort, but would not come down to the room to see what I was complainning about. Would not give me a refund on the remainder of my 10 day reservation as I had booked through Expedia. (Expedia did refund me though). Did not take time to do anything around the beautiful grounds as we couldn't check out of this place soon enough. Can't enjoy what ammenties the resort has to offer if you can't stand to be in the room, much less try and sleep there. Nasty, smelly, awful, horrendous, terrible room with obnoxious and clueless staff. Finally got an apology letter from the management with an offer of a free nights stay, but wouldn't stay here again even with the free coupon. We went to the Marriott on Hotel Circle and were super impressed with the suite, the cleaning staff, the free breakfast and dinner buffet, the cleanliness, new ambiance, helpfulness of staff, kids bunk room.

The good points below make it a great family destination. Wish they would fix the Bad and the Ugly though . . . We agree with the prior post that guests should not expect a fancy spa type of resort. THE GOOD: The pool, the location (near Sea World, Mission Beach, airport and more), in-room refrigerator, bay front rooms, small putt putt course. We had a one BR suite on the beach on the bay. Our daughter loved playing in the sand right outside the room and swimming in the pool. Fast access to area attractions was a real plus. We enjoyed the pool side bar & grill, and the large suite. Also a good family friendly restaurant on the grounds, and a very nice gift shop. Room prices were good for the area. THE BAD: Like seemingly all hotels in the Mission Bay area, it seriously needs to be renovated and updated. The rooms have decent decor, with some newer furniture, but the overall feel is pretty worn. The exterior and landscaping is very worn and not well maintained. The maid service is slow and not so good. Bunch of guys driving around in carts doing nothing. They have an espresso bar, but its hours of operations are erratic, and the grinder had some disgusting looking beans around the top. The coffee was not very good. THE UGLY: Our room (and others) flooded during the rain, with brown water seeping up through the floor and pouring down through the light fixture in the bathroom. Judging by the water damage on the baseboards and walls, this was not a new problem. At least they didn't argue when we asked for a partial refund.

With so many small buildings, each requiring it's own water heater, roof system, and plumbing, it's really tough to manage. It's not built like one huge building with one system to control everything. I'm sure each building also has it's own electrical panel too. The hotel does a pretty good job keeping up considering the challenges. 2. The scale is enormous. It's almost like it's own amusement park with all the paths and vegetation and wildlife. Everyday staff is outside hosing down the bird droppings and trimming the vegetation. The birds are everywhere. They really make a mess. But the exterior is quite clean considering the birds. 3. I don't know how the hotel can charge as little as they can considering the huge staff required to keep the place up. The staff required are 10 times the amount required for a single building high rise type structure. 4. The age of the buildings put them right at the point of being torn down.

He then said the he would waive the $20.00 per night (that we did NOT know about in advance) parking fee for being return customers. The parking spot was right in front of our room. It wasn't like they had to rent a spot in a nearby garage. The bell person was friendly and asked if our daughter would like to ride in the golf cart to get to our room. Being three, she thought that was a good idea. He was helpful. Upon opening our room there was a very musty smell. The room was obviously in an old building. They had redecorated - newer paint over badly prepared chipped walls. The furniture was new. But there were two small cafe chairs paired with a small round and short end table for a \"dining area\"- odd. The bathroom was a strange mix of old and new. New granite or marble countertops. Old bathtub and tile. AND DIRTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dirty toilet surfaces. Mold growing on the walls. An incredibly moldy shower curtain. Hair everywhere. Thick dust on the lampshades. Thin and dingy towels. Mold growing on the closet walls too. We ordered room service that night. It was fine (not remarkable either way). They did not pick up the dishes that were left out all night until after housekeeping came the next day. Breakfast our first morning was pleasant enough. We ate outside and our server was fine. Dinner in the casual restaurant that night was not great. The service in the mostly empty place was terrible. I am a 20% plus tipper and I even said to my husband that we won't be tipping much. Breakfast the day after was ok but with terrible service. We were due to check out and said to post the bill right away.

They were CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, OFFERED A FREE SHUTTLE TO SEA WORLD, GOOD STAFF AND A GREAT PLACE TO EAT WITH OR WITHOUT KIDS. The water main even broke on our way out. We stopped to get a bite to eat in the restaurant and Anna the manager was very on her toes, making it all work out without running water.

They do have a small gym which you can use the day of service, but regular hotel patrons pay $10 a day for. For the price of this hotel the gym should be free! Also the \"quiet room\" I look forward to at spas is next the main pool were tons of kids were playing, so it is not Quiet! The lasrt night we ordered room service, which tasted ok, but took an hour to arrive. It was pricey but room service always is, but what killed me was an 18% gratuity charge PLUS a delivery charge....more added fees! So we finally check out, and are glad to be done, when we get slammed one final time! As I mentioned before there were errors on our bill, but they also charge $16 per day for parking! Usually I can understand this when the fee is told upfront, but from the way it was presented at check in you thought the parking was included. The spot has your room number on it, so if you don't use it no one else will....just another way to bang you out for a few bucks.

You're not on the ocean; the water is still and the beach is not very attractive. We liked the main pool very much, the grounds were very nicely landscaped and the restaurants were good (Baleen is overpriced with no entree less than about $25+).

That added tot he feeling of being \"nicked and dimed\" (so did a poor $4 latte). Also, the observation tower was covered in bird excrement, which reflected poorly on the hotel generally. There's also a slight \"theme park\" feel here as opposed to that of a truly elegant resort (which they represent themselves to be).

We paid an extra $50 a night to upgrade to a bayside view room- 233. To be honest, I was a little nervous about staying here because of the reviews on here, but we had a great time- don't be put off. We found staff to be helpful and friendly. The grounds are really amazing- gorgeous gardens and pools, with blazing torches at night- it was a shame that we had lousy weather as we would have enjoyed it much more with a bit of sun. Having said this, the pools are heated, and we loved the adult pool with the hot tub at night- it is pretty much deserted and very romantic with changing light colours in the pool/tub at night, with clean towels provided at the pool. If the weather had been hotter we'd have loved to have stayed on the loungers there. The bayside view was really lovely too. We ate at the Barefoot Bar and Grill every night and for breakfast one day- we found the prices to be reasonable and the food nice- eg $6.95 for 3 massive pancakes and syrup. Service was very good too. If you feel like eating out one night and don't have a car, take the no. 9 bus into Old Town, where there are lots of nice Mexican restaurants. The bus stop is at the end of the entrance to the hotel. the Baleen was too expensive for us. Sea World is a short walk away. We wanted to visit Coronado, so took the Old trolley Bus tour which can be booked and picked up from the hotel for $30, which was good value. We also went shopping at Horton Plaza and at Fashion valley. You can get on the no 9 and change at the Old Town transit center for Fashion Valley mall, all for $1.75 fare. Alternatively there is a free shuttle that goes from the hotel twice a day except Sunday. We loved the shopping and got some bargains in the Macys sale. On the downside, we were pleased with the room, but found the carpet to be a bit dirty if we went barefoot- probably because of the bayside location. It did smell a bit musty on arrival, but we didn't notice it after that and it didn't affect my asthma at all - think it's its sea location which causes this- we went to mauritius and had the same problem with mustiness but worse. We didn't have ants- and were generally pleased with the size and facilities in the room- not as bad as painted on here. Gift shop was very pricey for essentials, which was a shame ($7.99 for a sandwich). These aspects stop us giving it a 5- if the prices for rooms were a little lower and the rooms refurbished we would have given the resort 5. Similarly, we found the Spa to be very expensive ($120 for a 50 minute facial), so did not use this, when i would have loved to have gone if it had been a bit cheaper.

After reading all the negative reviews, I was a little hesitant to stay here. Our main objective was clean grounds with a tropical atmosphere and walking distance to the beach, all of which were met at Paradise Point. Considering the price difference between a Bay View room or a Lanai Garden View room, we found the latter more affordable for us. Upon check-in I requested a room with a view of the lagoon (thanks to the advice of another reviewer). Our room (123) was clean, very near the lobby and overlooked a lagoon with ducks, which the kids loved to visit on our walks of the grounds. The room did not have a window, so we had to leave the air conditioner on to keep cool. It would have been nice to really enjoy some of those wonderful evening breezes. The front door is all glass, so there is some natural light in the room. The lush landscaping is really beautiful. There are winding paths all throughout the complex, so keep the map provided by the front desk. We requested 2 queen beds and a crib for our youngest. We found the sleeping arrangement comfortable at night, but with 5 people moving around, it was cramped in the morning while getting ready. We didn't spend much time in the room, so it wasn't a huge issue for us. We spent 1 entire day at the main pool. The shallow end is painted to look like sand, but is really concrete. Regardless, it is very shallow for the small kids and gently slopes from ankle deep to approx 5 ft. deep. My family had an absolute blast at the pool. We met a very nice family and spent the day talking to them in the shallow waters while our children played and splashed. The main pool has a beach cafe and provides waitress service for beverages (alcohol & non-alcohol) and lunch items (burgers, hot dogs, chicken wraps, salads), which was convenient so we didn't have to interrupt our fun to shower & dress the children to have lunch. Some of the other reviews noted the restaurants on the property as \"pricey, and not very good\", so we ate off-site for most of our meals.

The bad things: \"Service\" was horrible, and I am not a person who is interested in overly-attentive service, but like it to be decent. It wasn't. The first day we ate at the casual restaurant. We waited about 15 minutes to order (finally went and got a waitress) and literally 30 minutes for a plate of nachos and 2 kids dinners of chicken fingers, and 2 glasses of wine.The restaurant was not crowded and we saw lots of wait-staff come and go from the kitchen. We did not try the other restaurant, so I don't know how that would have been. In general staff were not very nice or helpful. We went there again the second night, basically because we had tired and some jet-lagged kids with us (rather than go find a better restaurant off the resort as others have correctly suggested). The waiter paid more attention to our tables, but that didn't seem to stop him from forgetting stuff and for the whole thing to just took way too long. The room was ok, but just ok. There was a used band-aid stuck to the bed post (how did cleaners miss that??) Our alarm clock was left set by previous guests for 6 am. I wouldn't expect staff to check for that, but it could be a nice thing to think of. I guess we will next time. Our friend's room (with a little kitchenette and living-room area in addition to the bedroom) was downright dirty and run down. She is from NY so when she first described it I thought she meant it was like shabby-chic and maybe she just wasn't used to that Ca. style (which I like) but no, when I saw it I realized it was just shabby. The grounds were pretty, with flowers, ducks, etc. The rooms overlooking the little cove were cute, and the kids enjoyed digging and playing by the quiet water. But again, not terribly clean. Our room had 2 little chairs overlooking a grassy area outside that was pretty, but the trash everywhere seemed to be overflowing, and the whole place just has this run down, rather than resort-like feeling. The parts of it were nice had little to do with the resort which is ridiculously overpriced for what it is. It was nice because we were in San Diego, which is beautiful, and because we were seeing our friends and playing with our kids. Our little trip was not ruined by staying there, because it would take a lot to make San Diego unpleasant, but it did bug us all that we had paid for and expected (nice website) something that this place did not deliver. The bottom line is this place should be either cheaper or nicer. If it was the cost of a normal hotel room (not a resort, which it isn't) that would be fine, it could be a decent family place that is a little worn out but fun. If it was much nicer and shinier and the service was decent and the rooms and grounds more uniformly kept then they could charge what they do and that would be ok. As it is, I would say find a nice hotel room and go enjoy the beaches, restaurants, and attractions of San Diego.

There was a sizable walk-in closet a nice sized vanity area, with the bath & toilet in a separate room.

Room: We selected a garden view that had 2 queen beds. Room was small and had more of a street view than garden. Inside the room was a table with 1 chair, a lounge chair, a TV and small refrig. There was a closet with iron and board next to a vanity area. The bathroom was small in size. There was an area in the back (outside) that had 2 lounge chairs. Depending on the size of your family, you might feel squeezed in as we did. The whole complex is one level, so no one above you! Recommendations: If you want a \"garden view, ask for one away from the street that actually looks over a pond or garden. Parking: You park right next to your room. However, it costs $15 per day! Grounds: Lots of flowers, trees, birds, ducks, ponds, fish and trash. For such a big, beautiful area, it's a shame that the grounds are not kept up better. There were areas of trash in the ponds and even a dead duck. The duck was still there when we left! Some of the ponds smelled due to lack of moving water. Pools: There's 5 pools in this complex. The \"main\" pool area is a sandy, beach like area surrounded by lots of lounge chairs. There's also a food/drink area for kids and adults. The problem here is that the pool is only 3 1/2 ft deep. This is great for small kids to maybe 7. If you want to actually swim, this area won't work. There's also a jucuzzi. The other \"heated pools\" include: >An adults area only. Nice pool and jucuzzi, but not for kids >The \"waterfall\" pool was great for my kids. Heated and 8ft deep. Activities: 18 hole, min golf ($9 per person), bike rentals ($10-$20per hr). There's a marina that has sailboats, motor boats, pedal boats ($20-$80 per hr). The beach area has several \"fire\" pits. One suggestion would be to bring your own wood and have a beach party. The complex charges you $50 for a small stack of wood, some marshmellows and stuff to make smores. Food: Room Service (didn't use so I don't have a recommendation).The complex has 2 places to eat: 1 casual, 1 semi-upscale. We ate 2 times at Barefoot (casual). We sat outside next to a pond area that included sharks, sting-rays...Food was average. There's a kids menu. Adult plates averaged $12-15. They also serve breakfast. Didn't eat at the \"upscale\" place. Didn't eat at the \"main\" pool area. There's also a \"Market/Gift shop\". Prices are way overpriced. We actually paid less at PetCo park than the complex \"market\" Location: From a location point of view, you're within minutes of everything. 10 mins to Belmont Park, 15 mins to Balboa Park/Zoo, 5 mins to Sea World, 15 mins to Seaport Village, 15 mins to Old Towne.

The room was smaller than I had expected but since our room was on the water it made it okay for the time we were actually in the room. The main complaint I have is that they need to have a bay maintanence crew. My son was digging in the \"sand/dirt\" and found a corn cob pick with a very sharp point. The sand/dirt should be kept up since there are firepits along the bay and that tends to add to the problem.Overall, this is a perfect place to stay with kids since there are a lot of things to do and the pool is very nice and warm.

If I had it to do over again I probably would have picked a different resort. Check in was fine- we arrived about 1:30 and our room was ready. Very nice man gave our girls and my husband a ride in his shuttle to our room and I followed in the van. I was immediately disappointed with the location of the room. It was right next to the convention center . This made our view from our room some type of wood fence that was used to hide some of their equiptment. Since I had not specified where I wanted my room, I did not complain. I was also disappointed about the size of the room. There were two queen sized beds and a small desk with two chairs. The TV was set into an armoure that also held a very small refridgerator. If my husband and I had been traveling alone the amount of space would have been fine. The bathroom sink was very nice, but again very small. The shower/bath was also tiny.There was a strong must smell in the room. I decided not to fret as we were planning on spending the majority of the time at the pool and Sea World. We ordered room service that night. Took about 30 min to get our food. I would give it a 2 on a scale of 1 to 5. Not cheep by the way! In the morning we woke up to find we had visitors in the bathroom. Ants! I was not pleased about this. I do not go camping because I like the outdoors to stay outdoors!! We called housekeeping and advised them we would be gone for the day and would appreciate the ants be gone when we came back. Sea World was wonderful. Only stayed a few hours. Did breakfast with Shamu--I highly reccomend this for the kids!! They loved it!! Decided to go back to the hotel and swim. We would finish Sea World the next day. We really enjoyed the main pool. There were many families, but that was fine with us...we had ours with us!! The service at the pool was great. We always had a drink in our hand and the food was OK. Not a very big selection and the prices were high, but it was nice to be able to eat at the pool. The girls had their hair braided poolside. They thought that was neat. I would give the pool area a 4 on my 1-5 scale. The ants did make a return a couple of times and eventually I did not smell the musty smell. Must have gotten used to it. When we checked out we complained again about the ants and the fact that one day we came back and had no parking space--there was something going on at the convention center. They ended up crediting two days of parking which was $18/day. There were many on site activites- boat rental, bike rental, ect. We did not visit the beach at the resort, we drove to Mission Beach.

Our room was clean and nice and the grounds are decently maintained overall. The service was attentive, especially at the pool, where we ate lunch one day. We also ate one meal at the Barefoot Bar and Grill and the service was friendly and the food decent. The only bad thing is there are tons of large birds everywhere at the Barefoot Bar and Grill and one was eating eggs off of a table near us, which I thought was really gross. The family sitting there must have found it acceptable because they just sat there and allowed it. The restaurant should post signs discouraging that because the birds are a bit of a nuisance. I felt safe walking around the resort, even at night, because of all the families and other people around. The main pool is very large and warm and the pool area is kept clean. Some areas of the grounds could use a little TLC, such as a bit of trash in the lagoons and the water is a little funky in some places. Some of the outdoor furniture by the lagoons could also use a cleaning as well (the pool furniture is kept very nice). We stay at a lot of hotels and I felt that Paradise Point did an overall good job of meeting our needs. I am picky and would be quick to point out anything gross or dirty in our room. The curtains in our room need to be replaced because they were torn and worn on top. Other than that, the beds are very clean and comfortable and the rooms are quiet. I guess people's impression of this resort depends a lot on where the room is located and there is a lot of variation. Our room did not smell musty at all, nor was the carpet dirty, as I have read in other reviews. Why some rooms are cleaner than others seems strange to me as well (different housekeeping staff?). This is a nice, family-orientated place to relax. There are lots of kids everywhere, so we felt very comfortable (I was not the only pregnant lady by the pool). I wanted a place to stay with the kids while my husband worked in San Diego and not have to drive anywhere during the day. Our room was right on the bay and we had a lovely view. We walked on the beach at night and enjoyed all the bonfires and other people around. One last thing-the prices for snacks are very high in the gift shop and restaurants are pricey (the resort does seems to nickle and dime you). Since the rooms have refridgerators, we went to a grocery store and stocked up on juice boxes, bottled water, yogarts, fruit, etc. and ate breakfast on our little patio.

After reading several negative reviews prior to my trip, I was very concerned, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the Paradise Point to be the perfect accommodation for our family.

Had a stone massage by Matt, pedicure by Trisha, and facial by Bree. Loved everyone. Not cheap and they automatically add the 20% gratuity to your bill. Ate at the Balleen Restaurant. Wonderful \"Lobster Martini\" for an appetizer and I had the filet one night for dinner and crabcakes the next night. Came with avacado dip which I don't like, so they made a special tomoto sauce. Very accommodating and a relaxed atmosphere. Resort casual dress. Had room service twice. Since the place is so big, food was slightly cool by the time we received it. It was just okay. Only problem, is they don't come back and get the trays, leave it up to the cleaning people. Biggest drawback, no ceiling fans and no robes in rooms. Quite unusually not to have robes especially at a spa resort. Overall, I would probably go back here only for the spa experience. Pool was crowded with families and small children. Too close I guess to Sea World. Beautiful grounds, friendly staff, we did not have an ant problem, but left our door open one morning and in walked three ducks. Quite comical. Got them out with a few Ritz crackers...... Airport in San Diego is terrible, have been there many times, but now is extremely crowded. Had to wait in line 20 minutes to use the restroom. Treated like cattle throughout the airport. Makes us not want to go back for a short weekend. It deinately needs major overhaul. Too bad because it is so convenient to Las Vegas for us.

There were too many little things that taken together raise big red flags. I was in an upgraded bayview room. I walked in to a strong cleaning scent that wasn't extremely pleasant. I opened the patio door to let the room air out while I unpacked. Minutes later, two ducks were wandering into the room. There was no screen on the door (even though there was a track for one), so you couldn't leave the door open without the ducks wandering into the room. There were cigarette butts all over the lawn outside the room. The butts remained, even after the landscapers spent the next morning grooming the grounds outside my room. The security lock on the main door to the room appeared to have been reattached before, like the door may have been kicked-in in the past. The ice machine and pop machine were located a good 5+ minute walk from the room and the grounds are very dark at night. The spa was terrible -- small, cheap and overpriced (they constantly are upselling you -- talking you into additional services and/or products. I had a facial and the therapist insisted that I needed a brow waxing and made me feel like I'd be an ugly fool not to let her do it. Then she wanted to sell me very expensive products for my face...). Back to the spa -- no waiting area, no whirlpools, very small saunas and steamrooms and only two showers in the locker room. And they only gave you one small bath towel. There were no piles of towels anywhere in the locker room -- just one small towel in your assigned locker. The \"business center\" was a joke. I wanted to FedEx some materials back to my office, so I went to the \"business center\" to find an unstaffed room with computers, printers, fax machines and credit card readers for your payment. No packing materials, etc. I went to the front desk and was told to go to the conciege. The conciege couldn't give me a box and waybill, but would take my items, have me fill out a long form and have \"the shipping department\" send them for me (for a fee). No thanks.

That's pretty standard in every hotel here. But, if you're looking for one of those warm weather resorts with a huge pool near the ocean - this is definitely NOT it. I live in Los Angeles and we drove down for a few days with our 6 year-old daughter. This place is a great location if you're headed to Sea World. (It's next door.) And it was loaded with folks from England who we enjoyed meeting. But, it had some kinks that bugged me. When we arrived (a bit before the 4 PM check-in) the computer was down and they couldn't check us in. We had to wait an hour to check-in. The main pool is not very big and the jacuzzi is small and up the steps from the pool. There are three other pools on the property - but the others are much smaller and only one other one is heated. (It was chilly when we were there.) There is only one jacuzzi. This might seem picky - but, this is a huge complex with dozens of rooms. If the weather had been warmer and more people were in the pool and jacuzzi - you wouldn't have been able to move. As it was - I kept bumping into people when I was swimming. Our room was a lanai room - no view of anything except the parking lot in front of our room. Okay, that's what we paid for, but forget about the barbecue pit and view of the water unless you want to pay $300 a night. (Not really worth it.) Our room was conveniently located next to the main lobby and pool though. And it gave us easy access to our car. There seemed to be a lot of hidden costs where you felt nickel and dimed: $18 for parking, $10 to use the gym. The food at the restaurant was not very good and overpriced and the service was poor. And if you want to order one of those tropical drinks while you sit by the pool - it's $9.00. Oh and leave the golf clubs at home - that silly putting course they have is for kids and they charge extra to use it! Our first morning we were woken up by the gardeners at 6:15 AM mowing the lawn right outside our room. We complained and got $50 off the room. But, I would have prefered the sleep. That afternoon we returned from Sea World to find my earrings were missing from the room. We complained again and got more money off - but, again I would have preferred the return of my opal earrings. The rooms are nicely decorated in \"country\" style. But, the maid short-sheeted our beds every night and by morning I was sleeping on a bare mattress. When you go to San Diego you have three choices of areas to stay in: the Gaslamp area downtown which is terrific - you can walk everywhere. But, maybe not the best place for families with young children. There's Old Town which is a must see, another walking area and some nice hotels are there, (Best Western Hacienda is wonderful) but you might get some freeway traffic noise. Then there is the Mission Bay area near Sea World. Paradise Point is really on a point that juts out into Mission Bay. You have to know though that this is a marina and boating area - and you are not allowed to swim at the beach across from the hotel. The other problem with Paradise Point is that you have to drive to get to anything. You can't walk to restaurants or stores or pick up the trolley to Mexico like in the Gaslamp or Old Town area. Still I think if you have kids you might like the space at Paradise Point where the kids can run around. San Diego is a compact city though (unlike LA!) and Old Town and downtown San Diego are only a few minutes drive away. If you stay at Paradise Point, I'd suggest getting your drinks and some snacks at the grocery store. Thankfully there's a small (empty) fridge in the room and if you just drive down the road from the hotel you'll find a Von's and Ralphs. There are some things to reccomend this hotel: the staff at the front desk was courteous, the hotel was clean and well maintained and there was an effort to accomodate the guests. There's some nice touches on the property like the fountains that turn into torches at night. I'm sure the spa is nice - although I didn't have a treatment. But, I have to tell you the $10 for the gym was worth it because it also alllows you to use the eucalyptus steam room in the spa - now that was HEAVEN!", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mammoth Lakes, CA", "Title": "\u201cHow can you not love this property?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3365041", "Content": "I just got back 4/12/2005. After booking I read the reviews which seem to be quite varied, so we simply prepared for the worst of the reviews to be partly true. I cannot recall a more delightful stay!!! We booked a garden lanai but wished we had a room on the bay, once we got there. For $25 more per night we were moved to a room on the bay for our remaining two nights. Not only that, but we were at Sea World, so all we had to do was round up our suitcases and leave them together in the room. The bellman came by when the new room was ready and moved our bags. I was afraid we'd have to check out at noon and back in at 4, but no, they moved us directly over at 3:30. I don't understand the parking complaints, your space is reserved and right at your front door. So $18.00 is a little steep, but the overall cost is not. People that don't bring a car probably appreciate this expense not being \"included\". Food was great at the restaurants, every single staff member was cheery and polite. Every big \"tower\" hotel we drove past we all agreed \"I'm glad we're not staying there!\" My boys 11 and 13 will absolutely NOT sleep in the same bed and in any other hotel I've been in when there are 2 queen beds they do not allow a rollaway.

I think that some of the ant comments were rooms in the garden area, located inside the resort.

The room rate was $297 (incl tax) and it was very nice.. 2 queen beds, tv, refrigerator, coffee maker... the bathroom was very spacious! The only bad part was I felt like I was in a bubble.. the doors were glass and had a sheer fabric for privacy. Behind the sheer fabric was a plastic thicker cloth, so at night I felt fine, but I could see people peeking in while they walked the beach. The check in process was ok. I didn't know that check in was 4:00 and I had a massage at 4. I checked in at 3:00 only to be told my 2 rooms were not ready yet. My one friend decided not to get a spa treatment and said she'd wait til 4. Well by 5 we still had no room. The resort gave us a $30 credit but heavily hinted to use it at the bar. I guess they did not want to \"refund\" any money, eh? If you want a place to stroll or water sports, this is a great place. Plenty of hideaway area to sit and relax... lots of Ducks and fowl walking around... not at all intimiadated by the guests. I wish we had more time to sit around the outside area with a drink... or even lounged in the check in area. I do admit that the service was prompt. We had one of the doors missing a sheer fabric. I called housekeeping and they fixed it in 15 minutes. Their concierge was friendly but not very helpful in suggesting a reasonable priced steak restaurant. They had a stack of menus to choose from local restaurants but they were as pricey as you can get.. well the one she showed me was \"Max's\" and steaks were $30+. She offered making reservations, which was helpful, but We ended up going to a local Outback Steakhouse, off the 8 freeway. It was a bit frustrating that the concierge had no clue where the nearest Outback was when we asked for directions. The massage treatment was wonderful... price was no different than any other resort ($95 for a 50 min sweedish, $145 for an 80 min serenity massage) but I did find their automatic 20 percent tip a bit outrageous. I know I could have adjusted it if I didn't feel it was worth 20 percent, but they should allow the guest to determine, not have them tell you how much. I think the $18 parking was a bit outrageous. You do get to park right near your bungalow (or they call it the Lanai) but the area was so squishy, I felt the car next to me would ding my car. I think if you want to park near you can pay. If you don't mind walking you should have free parking near the Gift Shop. The breakfast at the Barefoot restaurant was tasty and good, but a bit pricey. $8 for oatmeal and raisins, $3.95 for a carafe of coffee (per person), $3.95 for OJ (but squeezed with pulp), and $11 for corned beef hash with an egg & holandaise sauce on top.", "Date": "April 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwish we were still there\u201d", "Author": "oersue", "ReviewID": "UR3346513", "Content": "We stayed for five nights at Paradise Point in the garden rooms, check in went smoothly and there were no problems with the room.

I've stayed at several luxury resorts for work such as the Ritz-Carlton (Naples, Boston, Atlanta, San Juan), Westin Diplomat, The Jefferson (Richmond), Loews Coronado, and several other. Paradise Point is not at that level but I paid at least $200 less per night. I thought the grounds were gorgious and I found the staff extremely nice and friendly. I thought the rooms were comfortable and nice. I really enjoyed the privacy and layout of the resort. All the rooms are \"bungalow' style. They upgraded us to a bay view after I told them about the occasion and because there was availability. The room was a bit musty at first but the mositure we've had in area is probably the cause of that. After we opened the patio door and let the breeze come through the room, it was very nice. We ate lunch at the grill. I didn't find it as expensive as everyone else in these reviews. It's not fast-food prices and the food was good. All and all we both thought the property was nice and well worth the cost. It offers a lot more than a cookie-cutter downtown hotel. The best advise I could give is to take these reviews with a grain of salt. I would definitely recommend this resort if you're looking for affordable accomodations in a great location.

The door to the closet was broken which made it unaccessable. The furnature was warped which made the drawers unable to open without a huge tug that I thought was going to bring down the 25\" TV. The wicker chair in the corner was FILLED with dust and the lamp shade was torn at ever edge. There were ants in the bathroom & on the counters, which given the wet \"tropical\" surroundings I guess it could be expected. The bed mattress was the only thing that was actually nice about the room. The window that looked out on to the \"lagoon\" collected so much moisture we couldnt even see out of it. and that \"lagoon\" turned out to be a small shallow duck pond that looked more like water collected in a rain storm. The heater was so bad, 1 it didnt work that well, 2, it was so loud we couldnt sleep when it was halfway working. there is a small frig on the shelf next to the tv that kicked on every 15-20 minutes with a high-pitched whining noise.

We had to call the front desk and verify we werent charged for a movie we didnt even get to watch, they said we were not charged but that the movie was no longer available because only so many rooms can rent a particular movie at once.

Pretty standard for resorts. We also took advantage of room service quite a bit and found it a better option as we brought our own juice and other drinks and put them in the refrigerator there in the room.

Yes, the prices at the restaurant seemed a little high for family style eating and the spa was pricey as well, and some of the features in the room were slightly worn, but there were so many positive things about the hotel that outweighed any negative marks I've seen written about to date. First of all, the setting is just beautiful. The grounds are extremely unique with the lush landscaping, ponds, wildlife, and so forth. Moreover, the main pool/jacuzzi area is equally beautiful and great fun to swim in for kids and adults alike. While the bedroom we stayed in was a little dusty perhaps at first and had a torn screen door, it is hard to find such spacious rooms with such comfortable beds and linens anywhere. Moreover, any issues we asked housekeeping to attend to were promptly addressed. I also really liked how the rooms all had patios that went out to lovely gardens and ponds. It made for some very relaxing morning coffee sessions with my husband! Finally, I found the staff most helpful. At times, the facility seemed a little understaffed, but we also visited at an off-peak time, so this wasn't a big problem. Once Thanksgiving week rolled around, I saw many more staff on site, so I'm sure it is a function of numbers of people checked into the hotel.

The kids slept out in the living room on the pull out couch. We had a king size bed in a separate bedroom. A single bathroom is shared by all. The toiled is in with the shower so one person at a time had the whole bathroom. The room definitely showed it's age. The Bay outside was ok, but there were signs about the water not being safe after a rain (runoff). We did not feel that the bay water was swimmable and was cold.

Seaworld was great. Our daughter got splashed by Shamu so when we got back to the room she layed her wet sweatshirt out on our deck chair.

Huge walk-in closet and big bathroom. The room looked exactly like the picture on the internet. A bowl of fruit with fancy water was a nice greeting. The bed was very comfortable and I had the best sleep of my life because it was very, very quiet. Anyone who is a light sleeper like me knows the value of a good nights sleep!! To me, waking up to the peaceful view of the bay is heaven on earth. We had our morning coffee in the Adirondack chairs and watched the birds swim and the fish jump. From there we went to the Barefoot Bar and Grill and had pleasant service and delicious breakfasts every morning of our stay. Our children, ages 9 and 11, had the buffet and my husband and I ordered from the menu. If your children are big eaters, go for the buffet. The granola encrusted french toast was a favorite. The grounds are amazing! You feel like you are in the Carribean with the lush landscaping and tropical trees and flowers. The main pool was teaming with children who act like children! The pool is heated and clean enough. It is partly surrounded by a sandy beach so the water gets murky. Lots of clean towels and waitresses serving drinks by the pool. Yes, the drinks are expensive. Nothing that you wouldn't expect at a resort. My husband and I shopped at Ralph's in Pacific Beach and bought wine and snacks which we enjoyed while watching the sun set over the bay again from our chairs. The kids loved swimming in the calm bay and looking for marine life which is in abundance. The only other pool we went to was the children's pool which oddly enough was quiet with few children. This is a perfect family vacation even without the distractions of all the other San Diego attractions. Because it is so family-friendly, I am not so sure it is ideal for the couples seeking absolute solitude. I loved our room, the view, the peace and quiet, the landscaping. I would mention, if you are mainly visiting San Diego for the tourist attractions, it might be better to stay in a cheaper hotel since you won't have much time to appreciate the tranquility of the bay and surroundings. We also had our children go to the kid's club for an afternoon. They were well cared for and had a great time. Even though it was extremely expensive, it was worth it for a little alone time with hubby!! I recommend this resort to families who like to sightsee but also like to relax.", "Date": "August 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cIn addition...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2499299", "Content": "I forgot to include in my review that the room vanity light bulb was out, but was fixed with a simple call to housekeeping.

The own big downside to this resort is the price of food and drink - the value for money is poor and I would recommend eating offsite in the evening. San Diego is a beautiful city, the old town is great for a night out as is The Gaslamp District, two very contrasting places. Del Coronado is picture postcard stuff as is La Jolla. One word of warning - avoid Tijuana in Mexico unless you after bargains on leather and silver. The place is just full of shops selling rubbish and shopowners hassling you to buy their merchandise.

While the property was very pretty, it was not worth the $300 a night! The rooms were ok but nothing to write home about. The refridgerator knob was broken and it froze our drinks. A light bulb was missing over the bathroom vanity (which is very small) and I killed two spiders in the bathroom. The beds however were comfortable. My co-worker had no chairs on their patio. When they called about it they expected they would bring out nice chairs like the other patios had - they brought $5 plastic chairs. They were disappointed for the money they spent and value they recieved. Plus a $16 a night parking fee is rediculous. I was surprised that they charge for every amenity - tennis, fitness, etc. even the USA Today delivered to your room which most upscale hotels do not. The kids club was not geared for business travelers as the hours were 9:30 to 4:00 at a whopping price of $160 for 6 1/2 hours. There is no actual room for the kids like there is in other resorts they basically take the kids around the resort doing activites like playing tennis, walking on the beach, riding a bike, etc. My kids did have fun but the price and the times were not comparable to the other hotels with kids programs. The food was very overpriced and not very good. We ate at the pool and at the Barefoot restaurant - we would have gone out but there is not much around the resort close. I got a half hour massage at the spa and and found out that it is only for 25 minutes and they automatically charge a 20% gratuity! The treatments are all overpriced too - $72 for a 25 minute massage. On the 28th we moved to the Catamaran Hotel for the rest of our trip. The Catamaran has - which had similar type of grounds like Paradise but was $100 a day cheaper. We booked it through Southwest Airlines Vacation Package. We were pleasantly suprised that kids under 12 eat free at the Atoll restaurant, tickets for complimentary appetizers at the restaurant, complimentary cruise on Mission Bay for the family on the Bahia Bell, and tickets for 2 free hours in the arcade per child. Our room was spacious and had a kitchen with a full size refridgerator, dishes and cookware. Which was great to save money on eating out every meal. Plus the hotel had a schedule of activites most of which were free including surfing lessons, movie on the beach with coke & popcorn, kyak lessons, etc. They also didn't charge like the Paradise Point for all of the amenities like the fitness center, tennis, etc. They did charge for parking but it was $9.00 a night and it was covered in a garage.

We spent another 10 minutes making the reservation, returned to the line and waited another 15 minutes to be told that our room was not available until 4:30. We went to lunch at the outdoor restaurant (VERY overpriced with slow service but our 6 year old enjoyed the lagoon with fish and the birds so it was worth it) and then went to the pool. At 5:15 we were notified by cell phone (a nice touch) that our room was ready. Another 20 minute wait in line and we had a room. The room was small and the windows did not open. This left us with a choice of either being very warm, leaving the screen door open all night or having the air conditioner keep us awake. Why don't the windows open? Overall, the grounds were nice and this was a good place for a 6 year old. The bay was nice to explore. The front desk staff was borderline rude and very cold. We had no utensils or plates in our kitchenette and called to request some. We felt like we were putting someone out by making this request. Overall, it sounds like we had one of the better rooms.

We d heard a lot of great things about your hotel and spa and, I am sorry to say, experienced none of the pleasure about which others had spoken.For starters, we arrived at 3:15 P.M. on the afternoon of December 6th. Upon checking in, we learned that out room was not ready. I asked the person at the front desk what time check-out occurred and she said Noon. Why it took 45 minutes (we were finally allowed access at 4 PM) for our room to be ready I have no clue.I was led to believe by the person with whom I d spoken that the room was a suite, and that it was, indeed, separate from other structures. This was not the case. Our room, in fact, was attached to three other bungalows. I was also led to believe that this and another room (no ocean view) at $279 were the only two kinds of rooms left available at the resort. When we checked in, I heard a front desk attendant mentioning there were rooms available for far less. Thinking we were locked in to our $299 per night room, plus the fact that the phone reservation person said it was usually a $579 per night room, I figured What the heck? and we waited the 45 minutes until the room was ready. Upon seeing the room, we were surprised by: its small size; the fact that it was referred to as a suite at all; the fact that it was NOT separate but rather an attached structure -- the nearest room to ours housing a screaming child; the two spiders in the kitchen; the rust on the shower fixtures; the incredibly noisy heater; the fact that we bumped into doors all night, fumbling for the bathroom in the dark; and, in the morning, the fact that there were no flats on the windows, allowing the light to flow in at daybreak.The view, yes, was quite lovely from our windows, but other than that, the suite struck us as nothing more than a glorified Holiday Inn room. I, in fact, have been in Holiday Inns where I felt a great deal more comfortable. I took a walk on the private beach in the morning, only to find a bar-b-que pit with beer cans and garbage strewn about.

This place is absolutely huge but all the cool stuff is towards one side so you could end up having quite a hike to the main pool, spa, restaurants and gift shop. I made them re-assign me to a more centrally located room which they were quite accommodating with. Don't let them put you too far from the action (unless you prefer it). Also, the restaurants are beautiful but don't plan on eating there every night because they are a bit over-priced and the menu (especially at Barefoot) is pretty limited.

We need not have worried at all. It was fantastic. We were on a world trip in july and august 2003 and stayed here last for 5 days. The room was very clean and smart with lots of accessories and it was just a standard room near to Mission Bay. The steaks and food in the Balleen Restaurant are excellent. The portions in the Barefoot Bar and Grill were huge and well presented. Service was excellent although check in at 4pm is inflexible. All told we loved this hotel more than most we stayed in on this long trip. We would DEFINITELY say IGNORE the negative reviews - this place is a tropical paradise and we think the bad reveiws are from people who want to keep it a secret really!", "Date": "August 27, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1258259", "Content": "This resort was just wonderful and I plan on going back next year and staying longer. This resort from the time we arrived, service was A+ and I'm from Las Vegas, so I'm use to good service. The rooms were very clean and private. Great place to take the entire family. I would highly recommend this resort for a wonderful family get a way. The views of the bay are magnificant.

We stayed three nights. What a delightful time we had! No ants. We opened the bungalow door and it was a little musty. We plugged in the deoderizer, turned on the air conditioner, and headed to the Barefoot Bar and Grill for the $11.50 hamburger that is now $12.50. And what a deal it was! We could have spent thousands more for a trip to Hawaii and it would not have been any better than Paradise Island. With that $12.50 burger came a place so beautiful - lushious greenery, a pond next to the Bay so clear you could see the fish swim, a splashing waterfall, a trio of Spanish musicians, and friendly, well-polished service. We climbed the 81 step observatory and watched the 9:50-10:00 PM spectacular fireworks at Sea World (walking distance). I travel for my job and have high standards when it comes to hotels. This resort is not just \"a wonderful room with an elevator ride\" type of hotel.
