I booked a double room, when we arrived we had a room sized about 10' x 10' with two double beds and a single bed. We had to climb over the single bed to get to the wardrobe. We immediately went to Reception to say we thought they'd made a mistake as we'd booked (and received confirmation of) a double room and had obviously got a family room, a room that was only big enough for one double bed and a small wardrobe, the man on duty told us they were full and that was the only room available, despite the 'Vacancies' sign in the window and the fact I'd booked 3 weeks in advance. We just wanted somewhere nice to rest our heads so we thought we'd try and make the best of it and went back to the room. Then we tried to turn the bedside lights on only to find they didn't work, then the switches of the lights came off in ouhands. We decided enough was enough and again went to Reception, this time to complain and ask for a refund. The attitude of the only staff member was beyond belief, he said we had been in the room for half an hour and actually asked my husband \"did you use the toilet?\" - because apparently that meant we'd \"used both rooms\"... He came to the door of our room and said \"So?\", I said I didn't think this was adequate for the price (one hundred pounds) he said there was nothing he could do. He spoke only to my husband, no eye contact with me, the person paying the bill. I asked for a refund, he simply said \"No\". When I asked him to speak to me, he turned and walked away. Eventually (and this took some time) he agreed to book us into their other hotel in South Kensington, The Eden Plaza, I asked if they would pay for our taxi, again \"No\" - He was aggressive, rude and unhelpful to the extreme. Happily though, the Eden Plaza in South Kensington, is a great hotel, in a really lovely part of London, with helpful and friendly staff. We found a great Italian restaurant nearby, Carluccios, and had a great night. But the row we had at St George's was a real blip in what was supposed to be a nice, romantic weekend. We did have a nice romantic weekend - but no thanks to this horrible hotel.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riga", "Title": "\u201cAgree on \"you get what you pay for\"\u201d", "Author": "BirutaRiga", "ReviewID": "UR126280271", "Content": "Stayed there with 8years old kid for 4 nights. I was searching for cheap good location hotel with good enough reviews (most importantly - clean rooms) and this hotel matched these criteria. Overall I was rather satisfied. Location very convenient - 5 minutes walk to Victoria station (underground, busses, trains). It is one of those hotels with paper thin walls.... So huge deal of experience depends on the people living in rooms around you. After first night I was ready to change hotel because our neighbors were very load and I didnt get any sleep. Besides that it is not even possible to close door quietly as hard as you try; so it is rather bad when people next door walk in and out every minute. But other night it was better. I was very glad to see recently renovated wc/shower room - clean and fresh. The towels were changed every day (i just experienced for first time that it was only one towel for person; not other one for the face). Sheets and pillow covers very clean. The room was so tiny that there was no space for the suit case; unfortunately had to put it in the only chair or bed. TV had 3 or 4 channels (I dont care about that). No free wi-fi now; paid 5 pounds for whole stay and it was very slooow; sometimes couldnt get at all. There was very simple breakfast (corn flakes, muesli, yoghurt, orange juice, milk, water, coffee (good), tea, toasted white bread, jam, butter and cheese). And yes - we had a room on the very top floor.
