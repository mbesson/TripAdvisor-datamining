I read some great reviews of this hotel and found it referenced in some guidebooks on the area as well. I was a bit surprised by what was actually offered. It was an excellent area to be in and made the tourist sites of Sultanahmet so accessible! 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque and 10 minutes to the Grand Bazaar! We stayed in the Ottoman room. One of the best things about the hotel is the character. It really felt like you were staying in a place with a lot of history. I used to work in a Victorian museum in Canada and this felt like I was living in a museum...in a good way. It was charming. Also, the hosts were wonderful! Extremely friendly and went out of their way to make you feel at home. Even running to the store because we wanted ketchup with our eggs! The breakfast was very nice and large portions. Lots of bread, cereal, jam, honey, eggs, yogurt, etc. The host gave wonderful directions around the area and had good advice on where to eat and visit. If, like us, you only used the hotel to sleep and spent most of the time out and about - it is a good place to stay. However, there were some cons. The house is old and so there are normal problems associated with it. My main problem is that you had to wait a long time to get hot water in the shower, but if I left it running for 5 to 10 minutes, it did get warm. Also, there were lots of stray cats in this area and they did come in the house. There were some cat hairs on the carpet and stuff, but they did put a lot of effort into keeping the rooms clean. For me, there were more positives than negatives.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery charming, but not without its drawbacks\u201d", "Author": "urbanfoodie", "ReviewID": "UR127408040", "Content": "I went through many, many hotel listings in Istanbul looking for somewhere both affordable (under 100Euro) and with character.

Their breakfast was the best out of the hotels we stayed in too with eggs to choice and cereal and both tea and western style coffee. I loved the muezzin calls to prayer and thought this was a pleasant aspect of the place and certainly the volume was not overbearing at all.

The en suite shower was pretty cramped but we didn't care - the view from the roof terrace was spectacular and it was a short, picturesque walk from the Blue Mosque and Ayia Sofia.

We had booked a standard double room on the 3rd floor (4th floor for us USA-ians). Maria -- the very pleasant concierge -- also showed us the 1st floor Harem room for an extra 10\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per night -- and we took it. The bathroom was far superior -- the rooms on the 3rd floor have cramped bathrooms, and also there were 2 wardrobes/armoirs, making it easy to unpack and hang up all our clothes. Can't comment on the Sultan's or Pasha's rooms, but we liked the Harem room a lot. Breakfast (included in the room price, as is near-universal in Istanbul) includes eggs \"as you like\", a tower of bread, cereal, cut-up cucumbers and tomatoes, white cheese, and coffee or tea. Perfectly fine to fuel up for a day of charging around -- gets a little boring by the end of the week, but no problems here. I see that one previous reviewer complained about breakfast being on the ground floor in a windowless room. Not a real drawback as far as we were concerned. Location -- do NOT rely on their map -- we took a printout of a zoomed in Google map to help in navigating the narrow streets to get back to the hotel. This was essential the first 2 days -- after that, we had it memorized. You can see the map I used at http://goo.gl/jdPSy -- it is a 10 minute walk (at most) to the Blue Mosque or the Burned Column. The location is near the suburban train tracks, so there is a fair amount of noise from this from the early morning to late evening. As usual in a Muslim country, the amplified call to prayer will get you at about 5am. We always travel with foam earplugs, and slept with them most nights in Istanbul (as in Cairo, etc.). Tips -- ask Maria for advice. We went to the local neighborhood bath (Kadirga Hamam\u00c4\u00b1) at her recommendation, and it was great. Only 50 TL (40 + tip) each, and things went really well. The massage I got was very firm, but just right for me. This bath is just across the street from the Kadirga neighborhood police station in the park 2 blocks North from the hotel. On the southwest end of the park, across the street, is a good baklava place.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amersham", "Title": "\u201cExcellent haven in old Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Bruce21Amersham", "ReviewID": "UR99968962", "Content": "Had two short stays in Sepetember.

We planned to stay at Hotel Turkuaz for a week but ended up staying an extra five nights because we were stranded by the volcanic ash cloud. As a result we stayed in two different rooms and both were great. This is a renovated Ottoman house, not far from the Sea of Marmara, with lots of original and authentic features. The neighbourhood around the hotel is residential, where local people live and work and families relax together in the nearby park. It isn't a tourist trap and I hope it will stay this way as long as visitors respect the way of life of the area in which they find themselves. Maria, the manager, was incredibly helpful. She is kind, knowledgable, multilingual, approachable and full of good suggestions. She got up early to see us off when we left for the airport on the first morning that European airspace was closed and told us to come back if our flight was cancelled. She reassured us that she would look after us for as long as it took to get home and she kept her promise. Hotel Turkuaz became our temporary home and it was a very good experience indeed. Maria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff are meticulous, friendly and respectful. This is not a hotel for people who want to know that they will be staying somewhere exactly like every other international chain they have been in before. Hotel Turkuaz is one of a kind, and all the better for it. I've read some of the other reviews about this hotel and I disagree with the negative ones. Sometimes the water pressure was a bit erratic, but so what? Of course you can hear the call to prayer, but so you can all over Istanbul. Yes, there's a railway nearby and it's very convenient for getting to the centre of Istanbul or Ataturk Airport. If you are flexible and open to new experiences then this is the place for you.

Good restaurants very close and the fish restaurants of Kumkapi itself are a must, if a little expensive.

Also, note that the pension is a little bit out of the way, and taxis cannot find the last mile and get you there even with the address! (I don't know who to blame).
