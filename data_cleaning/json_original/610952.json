{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Description over the top, Rooms and location great the Service is very poor It was a great shame, The buildings are great as are the locations but the treatment was poor considering what you are paying it spoilt the trip. The rooms were not made on arrival at 3pm in the afternoon and had advised that we would arrive at 2pm, the refreshments were not left in the room ! The room was made up for two people rather than three. We had a power cut on the first evening and had to knock on the other apartment door to be told they would call the company and let them know to come over ! When leaving the lady was showing another couple and made no effort to say good bye or ask about our stay and seemed to keep forgetting the receipt requested on arrival. Unfortunately a sad experience overall.

I stayed at the new Ponte Vecchio suites and for the most part these expectations were met.I was met on arrival by Larisa, the very helpful manager of the suites. She was always able to help with my requests throughout my stay.The suite was excellently furnished with a sense of taste and quality throughout. The bathroom was better than all the 4* hotels I stayed in - I will miss the monsoon shower-head when I am home!The two LCD tvs were an unexpected bonus, as was the affordable minibar...The only negatives I have were that the quality of the finish was sometimes lacking, but only on close inspection. There were some light switches that seemed to have no purpose, some plug sockets that didn't work etc... but overall these were minor issues that never negatively affected my stay.I would definitely recommend this to anyone staying in Florence; the location was perfect for exploring the city on foot, and the spaciousness and comfort of the suite definitely justifies the expense.I will be staying here again when I come back.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551101945", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ipe20"}, {"Content": "Perfect for some, question marks for others       Bedroom as viewed from living room", "Date": "Sep 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR358107508", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Tashko"}, {"Content": "OK could be better We arrived in Florence late on a Thursday evening. We paid a very expensive taxi driver to take us 10yds from the station to our destination! Janice (the confident American) greeted us professionally and helped us settle in very well. We paid the bill upfront - which was a problem as their credit card machine wasn't working well. The apartment was well kitted out with all the amenities we needed. We expected it to be bigger but we were excited about our travels and looked forward to the weekend ahead!The street we stayed on was the most magical, fashionable one in Florence. We even spied Roberto Cavalli drinking espresso in his cafe at the end of the street!! The only downside was the fact that the cleaner (who was super friendly) only worked until Saturday. Sunday we had no toilet roll! No clean bed or bathroom. Very disappointing. In fairness to the staff, we were offered a night free next time we stayed.", "Date": "Apr 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR254496586", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Nattytravels"}, {"Content": "A gem The Tornabuoni suites are beautifully/tastefully maintained with all modern amenities and in excellent central locations. We stayed in the Belvedere suite which is situated in a beautiful pallazzo on Via Tornabuoni ; Florence's prime shoping street. It is within walking distance from all the main sites and boasts stunning views of the Florentine roof tops.The owner's attention to detail and care for his guests became apparent to us for the moment we arrived.Check out their web site.
