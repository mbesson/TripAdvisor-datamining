The bed was comfortable and clean, tea and coffee making facilities were provided and the TV had a decent range of channels. The room was very small - fine for a solo traveller, but the twin beds were so close together they were almost joining, so not really big enough for 2 adult friends to share a room. The room / bathroom was clean but not spotless. I found hairs on the wall in the bathroom, stains on the table etc. The room was a little run down and could do with an overhaul. I didn't use the facilities, but I noticed there are separate timings for men and women to use the swimming pool. I didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food and beverage.

Booking thru a reliable agent fr dubai is essential for cheap rates & good services.we r thankful that we got both Thereafter the cooperative staff helped us check in easily and we were glad to see the suite. The suite was quite large, around 25 by 25 sq. Ft. The rooms had two big king size beds and were clean and comfortable. The mattresses were quite new and the hotel on the whole also gave a novel appearance with all the modern and innovative furnishings. The sofa chairs though were an anomaly and had coffee stains on it, something which strikingly stood out from the otherwise clean ambience. The bathrooms were nicely decked up with a Jacuzzi and a shower cubicle. There was a wide array of different types of shampoos and conditioners, which my wife enjoyed. However again surprisingly they had only one set of bathrobe and a bathroom slipper in each room. There was a mini bar fridge which was also well equipped with complimentary water bottles. We got free coupons frm operator for the breakfast and snacks, the array of which was quite lip smacking. Snack choices included fruit and nut cake slices, brownies, umpteen kinds of sandwiches and a host of Arabic snacks. There was unlimited tea, coffee and juice on the house as well. The breakfast too had a similar choice menu. Next day we visited the city tour & dhow cruise with barbeque dinner.It was a pleasant experience exploring Dubai in quick time. The Deira Centre Metro Station is located quite close to the hotel and we used it to check out some places in the short time we had.

There's a constant stream of people checking in and out at all hours of the day or night and the dining hall is almost always occupied. For a high-traffic, short-stay hotel, I found it perfectly adequate, The rooms were a surprise. Rooms open off an interminably long corridor. Rooms are small and narrow but quiet and comfortable with a soft bed - all I wanted at the end of a long flight. Amenities were basic - TV, flimsy wardrobe, in-room safe. Bathroom was utilitarian but adequate. The dining hall provided surprisingly good food, although it wouldn't be my first choice for a family night out. Kudos to the staff for keeping the place relatively spic and span, given the high volume of traffic and constant hubub. The lobby area, in the same vein, was utilitarian with guide ropes for queues as an indication of the traffic volume of people checking in/out. There were always people and luggage arriving or departing, so forget about a quiet chat in the lobby area. A nearby shopping mall provides a shuttle service for guests in between flights.

A credit to the hotel its a no fuss cheap hotel in Dubai, rooms are okay, shower is old and a little naff , rooms can be hit and miss, they have a basic standard room and a superior, always go for the superior, its a nice apartment with a balcony, has a little kitchen and a better space (maybe 100 AED a night difference ). Bfast is included in your rate but dont bother, go for the no bfast option and get something in one of the malls, its packed every morning in the restaurant and i didnt like the food. Dinner there is good value though but check the buffet selection first, doesnt deal with Veggies. Its a dry hotel and operates a strict seperation policy in the gym and pool, so you cant swim with your wife etc. basically good value for money, reception can take an age and they are funny about early check in and will try to charge you for that. Good for Deira but as you are near the airport, taxis sometimes dont want to take you there so at peak times they just drive past you ( its 15aed ) try and book one early, the concierges are very helpful and sometimes there is a limo driver but he wants 40 AED, okay its fair enough if you leave it late to go to the airport, there is a nice restaurant across the street from the hotel and the Irish village is 14 AED away in a taxi. good central spot and good for people who will be out all the time during their stay, i have stayed there about 25 nights and apart from doors being knocked 4 times a day ( leave your do no disturb sign on all the time ) and kids running up and down the corridor ad your phone ringing at 3am every morning its very quiet.

The only bad thing about the room was there was no balcony which was requested at the time I made the reservation . Now for the bad! When we arrived the key card holder that controls the lights and A/C was not working properly. My son found that if he jiggled it and held it just so then it worked, soon as he let go everything went off. When we called the front desk they sent someone up. They first blamed in it the fact we had plugged something in that overloaded it. We had not as we had just arrived and everything was still in our suitcases. When he actually figured out that he was wrong he took the entire thing apart and put it back together and declared it fixed (without even testing it). When we put the card in it worked for a minute and then everything went off. He then proceeded to do the same procedure again and once again proclaimed it fixed. Again the same result. He said he would have to replace the unit and I told him that we were going across the street to the mall to get something to eat and would be back in an hour or so but to come in and fix it so it would be cool when we got back. He said he would be back in a few minutes and have it done when we got back. Well, he never returned and it was not fixed 2 1/2 hours later. I called the front desk and they said they would send the supervisor to fix it. Another half hour later the supervisor came and finally replaced the unit after trying to fix it and realizing that the unit was not fixable. Next - when we went to eat we both got sick and when we got back and had to use the toilet found it was not working (would not flush). Once again the ordeal with the workers. The first one came and told us it was stopped up! Actually I think we told him that but it made more sense to him when he told us! He said he could not fix it but would send someone. We waited an hour for this someone and no one ever came. Again I called the front desk and complained. I guess they called \"the supervisor\" and he came after another hour and \"fixed\" it.

If I were to go again, I would upgrade to a \"Creek View\" room, as the one we had overlooked a building site. Pointless paying for a balcony as it would be too hot to sit out anyway. Food.

Deira City Centre shopping mall (one of the best in Dubai) is about a 10 minutes walk away (across some busy roads). There didn't seem anything much else of note in walking distance, but there is a small grocery store 200 yards away (come out of the hotel and turn left). Arrived to find check-in efficient and friendly, and free parking in the basement. We didn't get the free fruit basket other reviews have mentioned, although there were tea and coffee making facilities (and a couple of small bottles of drinking water) in the room. Our room (Deluxe) was big with a big bathroon, effective A/C, and a safe. It had good views of the Creek but no balcony. Note that the hotel did not have a bar, and the district it is located in is very quiet, so you would need a taxi or your own transport to find the nightlife. However this is true of most hotels in Dubai, which doesn't really have a definable centre. Note that taxis can be hard to find in Dubai and we didn't notice many in the vicinity of the hotel. Anyone wanting the beach would have a 20-30 minute drive. The airport is probably 15 minutes away. We didn't try the restaurant but the in-room breakfast was OK. Swimming pool is rooftop on the second floor and looked nice (some welcome shade until mid morning, but some traffic noise). Overall, though the hotel left us underwhelmed. One problem was the wooden floors in the corridors and part of the room - we could hear other guests return to their room at night and lots of sounds of doors slamming. They need to invest in some nice thick carpets to keep the noise down. A further negative was a very poor choice of English speaking TV channels - just BBC World News as far as we could see. No sports or film channels aimed at western visitors. Note sure why this should be as most Dubai hotels have a wide selection of English speaking channels. Check out was below par, as the receptionist and her supervisor were involved in a discussion about some issue with the previous guest and, other than to swipe my credit card, my presence was barely acknowledged.

Not all their meals are listed on the room service menu so if there is something you want you ask and they will be happy to make it. Location wise, the hotel is 5 minutes walk to a huge shopping centre (I wouldnt advise jaywalking) and a \u00a31.50 ride away from the gold souk. The Rooftop pool was always empty and it seems the hotel was empty because I never really saw any other guests. Check in & check out only took 5 minutes and they sent the hotel chauffeur to pick us up from the airport at a cost of \u00a314 which is think is quite reasonable. We had a few problems with the toilet which was leaking but they immediately sent someone to repair it. The air-conditioning also wasn't quite cool enough for us. We tried to reset it and the room service guy tried as well but it just wasn't cool enough. I mentioned this on check out and the staff said I should have said something and they would have immediately changed our room for us. In fairness to the hotel, all other areas in the hotel were very cool so it could just be a dodgy thermostat. On return to the UK, the hotel sent us a lovely letter thanking us for our visit.
