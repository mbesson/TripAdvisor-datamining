Fare from the airport (plus luggage) was $22.50. Check in was efficient. We were in a \"suite\", which unfortunately is on the front side of the building where the highway is. We asked about noise and the front desk clerk said we could move to the back side of the building but the rooms were smaller. We met up with friends for dinner and by the time we got back to the hotel we were exhausted (been up since 5AM flying) so we just crashed in our room. I didn't hear any noise but I know that is because I was so tired. Ordinarily I sleep very lightly so it helped that I was very tired. On checking in we realized our key was not effectively opening the door (it took reinserting it 6 or 7 times before it triggered the mechanism to open it). When we returned from dinner we stopped at the front desk and asked for a new key and the front desk clerk said, \"If it gives you anymore trouble it may be the battery and will need to be checked.\" Sure enough, the second key took 7 or 8 tries but we were so exhausted by that time we just kept the key and told them when we checked out that there was an issue. Water pressure (which is very important to me) was virtually non existent in the shower. That might've made sense if we were on the top floor but we were only on the 2nd floor :P The room is very basic, as you will see in the pictures. The bed was very comfortable but the room was on the small side for a \"suite\". I guess adding the refrigerator makes it a suite. Not sure. Breakfast was very basic, toast, prepackaged honey buns, cereals and fruit. Nothing hot. The coffee was good though. Unfortunately, when we arrived to the breakfast (about 9:30AM) almost all the items were gone. This took a trip down 4 floors (it was faster to go up and down the stairs as the elevator is the slowest on the planet, I am convinced) to ask the front desk clerk to have it checked. After approximately 10 minutes or so 2 of the house keepers came up and restocked the breakfast. It would be helpful if they had someone on that duty the time the breakfast is open.

Bottom line, the price was reasonable. I've stayed there three times now, and the only negative thing I can say about it is that I always get allergies (I'm very sensitive and allergic) perhaps because when you first open your room the rooms are never left with the A/C on... but it has never smelled bad. But yes, I always get allergies. On the plus side, they do have a very conveniently located mini market that's opened late and carries just about everything you may need or may have forgotten back home. There's also a highly recommended restaurant where you can have Puerto Rican food at a great price and superb service.

The local bananas are yummy. Coffee was good. Cereals, milk, pastries, ham and bread for toasting also available. We went to see family and attend the Saborea food festival, which was at nearby Escambron beach. For us, the location was great.
