As I said staff is superfirendly and they help you in every way they can (giving you maps, suggesting you where/when to go...) The B & B is situated close to Trastevere train station and at a walking distance (or at a tram distance if you do not want to walk a lot. The tram stop is just outside the hotel!) to all main attractions in Rome. moreover it is close to the area of trastevere where lots of restaurants are situated and to the famous open market of porta portese (held on sundays)!

It was perfect for what we needed. Coming off of our cruise we trained back into Rome from Civitavecchia...a 30 minute trip on one train (from the port to Trastevere Station). Walk out the front door of the station; go through the parking lot; get to the sidewalk on your right and then walk up the street a bit and you are there. All in all I'd say it was 10 minutes from the train to the B&B doors. I appreciated RJS's review which let me know that the building could throw you a bit. The entrance is quite plain and as you are going up the small elevator if you didn't know, you might would be a bit unsure. Once you see the sign and enter the B&B though it is awesome. Very clean and the couple who were running it were very nice and helpful. Rooms are spacious, clean and yes...newly renovated with a modern feel. TV was great except for I never imagined it would be so hard to find soccer on TV in Europe. This could have been my fault as we were hardly in our room except for late at night :-) The air conditioner worked great; the bed was firm but I slept like a baby. Bathroom was small but not too small with great water pressure...Huge to me as I love showers. We really didn't eat breakfast but did enjoy some nice coffee. We felt very safe and welcomed. The B&B is perfect for getting quickly over into the quaint areas of Trastevere or the #8 tram literally right outside makes it very easy to get over into central Rome for sight seeing within 15 minutes. Don't forget though to check the tram times as we stayed out too late one night and got ourselves a nice little walk back. The location is also perfect for getting to the airport (FCO) as you simply walk back to Trastevere Rail Station and take the train directly to the airport (about 30 minutes). Very very easy...location plus reviews (and pictures...which are spot on) were why we picked the resort and the courtesy, cleanliness, and quality of the B&B were bonus for us. We would & hope to use the B&B again. Feel free to message me with questions.

You go up the front steps, turn right in the hallway and you'll find a small elevator (or staircase) at the end of the hallway. The B&B is on the third floor. I must admit given the age and condition of the rest of the building I wondered what I'd got myself into, however the rooms are fully renovated and stylish, my room had a modern ensuite. The rooms are clean. There is a fair bit of traffic noise so I recommend earplugs. The breakfast was great, and they make you a nice coffee if you ask! The hostess was incredibly kind and helpful, patient with all my questions, even escorting me to a local cafe around the corner and ensuring I was looked after by the staff. The bus stop around the corner takes you straight into Termini, and Trastevere Station is only a short walk away too. There is an internet cafe nextdoor as well. I thought the bed was a bit hard, but discovered that was the case with most beds in Italy!
