This was accompanied by a pot of warm tea & wait for it mould ridden toast! We then ate breakfast for the rest of the week in the local village for obvious reasons. ThIs establishment is more of a hostel than Hotel,tradesmens vans & trucks fill up the small forecourt outside the place,obviously just using the place to sleep at during the contracts they have,probably at the olympic stadium site nearby. It has been given a two star rating by the AA but I doubt whether this was given recently and certainly not to the present owners.I suggest they revisit the premises asap to review this approval rating for their own credibility at least. So if you are either thinking of staying local to the South Woodford area for whatever reason & you happen to come across the Grove Hill Hotel I urge you to stay away & keep looking elsewhere,youll be glad you did,trust me.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scunthorpe, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cif your wanting value for money this is a great place\u201d", "Author": "Sarah503982", "ReviewID": "UR111670851", "Content": "Just got back from staying here. Have to say that although initially the reception was a little frosty, due to the fact that our booking did not correspond with their listing, after alternative rooms were agreed (twins instead of doubles) they were very welcoming. The decor is slightly dated but very clean and had everything you needed. The breakfast was a full english, very nice and they did offer alternatives if you wanted something different. There's a good choice of shops/bars/restaurants within a 2 minute walk of the hotel and it's only a 5-10 minute walk from the tube station so perfect for anyone planning on spending their days in central London.

The only good things that could be said for the room was that it was clean and the bathroom had been refurbished. The new bath however was the smallest one I have ever seen and there wasn't a shower. We stayed two nights and had no change of towels or bed linen (we weren't asked or informed). The furniture in the room consisted of two single beds, one bedside cabinet and a very small built-in wardrobe made from unpainted MDF. Inviting, it was NOT! The carpets on the stairs were threadbare, there was thick dust on the door frames and finger marks around the door handles throughout the hotel. The breakfast was average, but with minimal choice.

Some advices: 1. ring before you arrive to double check if you have your room, as ours was on the system but not in their guest book they are working from!!! So if we wouldn't ring I dont know if we would have a room. 2. When we arrived the landlady and landlord are OK, but not very welcoming - that was our feeling as we stayed in few B&B before and compared. 3. Room was very nice, new and clean a bit small but for us two it was enough as we were only sleeping there. Room had a private bathroom VERY BIG ADVANTAGE!!! As there were rooms with sharing bathroom and WC ... looked inside - not nice very old tiles. But our room was perfect with private bathroom - request when you doing your booking. 3. Provided tea and coffee at room, the kettle didnt work properly but we figured out to make it work :-) not big issue. 4. Breakfast room - very small if you have lots of people staying over, but go early and you will be sorted :-) 5. Breakfast - they put it as a full breakfast but to my opinion it wasn't that great( 1 egg, 1 sausage, 1 warm tomatoe, 2-3 slices bacon, beans) - not a great deal but OK, also cereals and jams. 6.Every room had a old doors and I have to tried to figured out how to lock it but managed to do it - they should update it a little bit also the carpets were a little to much for me :-) 6. Guests in other rooms a bit noisy - no respect that others might sleep but when you sharing a bathroom no wonder :-) 7. Hotel is in a very nice area, we haven't been scared to walk around. Lots of restaurants and take aways around. We have also found a shortcut throught the Sainsbury to go to the Tube Station. The street where the hotel is situated is very nice and quiet, that is what you need. I would recommend this hotel as it is not bad and worth of money and in a nice area. Of course need a little bit of improvment but it's ok for money. If you are posh don't look for cheap B&B if you want to just sleep and get into the London it is a perfect location and hotel for you. Its on central line too, so to get to London takes max. 30 minutes. My review is very honest, because I would like to help others to choose what they want, but go for a private bathroom is nothing worse to share it :-) We are giving a rate 4/5 as I mention before there are things which could improve but I hope they will because its a nice B&B to stay in.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cThreatened with mugging, robbed of my deposit...worst hotel in London\u201d", "Author": "hikmatyar", "ReviewID": "UR37033746", "Content": "I booked a room here in July, and was denied entry, told \"I have a terrible attitude\" and threatened with a mugging on my way out.
