My buddy and I stayed here for one night last week on the first leg of a trip to Sonoma. I wish we could have extended our stay. He's hardly the B&B type, but even he was won over by the Drisco. Parking was a cinch. We found a spot directly across the street from the hotel and didn't have to move our rental car from 4 p.m. until 11 a.m. the next day. We were immediately greeted with hot towels after a transcontinental flight and found our room to be quite charming and comfortable. Plenty of outlets to plug in iPhones, Droids and laptops. Complimentary bottled water in the room and chocolate cookies were a nice touch. The coffee/tea service in the parlor next to the reception desk tied us over until supper. John, the general manager, and the other John and Marti were all very helpful and friendly. They seemed genuinely interested in how we enjoyed our stay. Location, location, location. We opted for the Drisco over Union Square or the Financial District because, quite frankly, those cookie-cutter hotels could be anywhere. Nothing says San Francisco like Pacific Heights, the dramatic vistas of the Palace of Fine Arts and sound of fog horns in the distance. Our friends stayed down at Fisherman's Wharf and it made me appreciate the Drisco even more. High marks for the breakfast: bagels, oatmeal, cereal, fruit salad, hard-boiled eggs, etc. I also appreciated the reminder call I received about my upcoming reservation 72 hours before my stay.

It is also not for you if you don't want to climb a hill or call a taxi. This beautiful hotel is perched up among the mansions of the Pacific Heights, so the coffee places and restaurants, while close, require some hill-descent and ascent.

Perched atop Pacific Heights among the beautiful mansions of this quiet neighborhood, it's a jewel of an old hotel, built in 1903 as a rooming house and impeccably renovated and maintained as a hotel. My husband and I came here with our adult daughter for a one-night visit to the City. I have to admit that my positive experience was influenced by the City View Corner Suite to which we upgraded. They offered us the upgrade when we checked in (maybe because it was the low season?) for only $75 more (which the doorman pointed out was really only a net increase of $50, since we'd have needed a rollaway in our original room which would have cost an additional $25). Anyway, we took it, and the suite plus the view of SF were so beautiful that we almost didn't want to go out and sight-see! The staff were all genuinely friendly and eager to help us. Marty at the front desk was great, as was Bob, the concierge-- what a guy. Special commendation for the mattress and sumptuous linens, the impeccably clean and well-maintained rooms, and lovely bathroom. And they offered so many little indulgences to guests -- evening wine-tasting, 24-hour coffee and tea service in the sitting room, a basket of fruit in our room on arrival, cookies with turn-down service, an ambient sound machine (not that there was much street noise to mask), a nice line of toiletries, pillow menu, etc. They even called me 3 days prior to our arrival to confirm our reservation -- a considerate gesture, since they have a 3-day advance cancellation policy. My only criticisms would be the full breakfast, which was well presented but not very good food with well-meaning but rushed and overwhelmed staff.

(We were there for a long weekend; make sure you check the city parking rules for weekdays when you will have to move your car.) We walked to a different restaurant each evening, down Divisidero Street, enjoying some of the city's classic Victorian architecture along the way. (I think the Hotel has a courtesy car as well, but we didn't make use of it.) Favorite hotel amenities: an elegant and relaxing evening wine tasting, with hot and cold hors d'oeuvres; a generous and tasty buffet breakfast; a pillow menu to ensure the perfect night's sleep; a cozy parlor for quiet conversation over coffee and tea. We've stayed in several different hotels in several different neighborhoods of San Francisco, but no more! We've found our home-away-from-home at the Hotel Drisco.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, New South Wales, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe personal touch\u201d", "Author": "John B", "ReviewID": "UR123728935", "Content": "We loved it.

If quiet sophistication that is backed up with a personal touch is what you\u2019re looking for, then this hotel is for you. The hotel is set in the elegant (but hilly) Pacific Heights area and although you can walk to Union Square (as we did) my recommendation would be to get a cab it\u2019s probably a bit beyond comfortable walking distance. As other reviews mentioned, experience the early evening wine tasting and that great healthy breakfast. I would like to give a mention to Julio, Ann and Raisa who managed these sessions, and without their attention our stay would not nearly have been so complete.

The afternoon wine tasting is a great way to meet fellow travelers. The breakfast buffet has a nice variety of items that should satisfy most tastes. My only criticism is that they didn't offer any egg choices other than hard boiled. I do like my scrambled eggs ! The hotel itself is well maintained and clean. You can see that the staff takes pride in the hotels appearance. One of the things I enjoyed was looking at all of the old photo's that hang throughout the hallways.

Bob also told us about the wine and cheese reception every night and the breakfast they offer daily included in our stay.

We stayed here on our last night in San Fran, we had already seen the tourist attractions in our first week before we went driving around the state, this was a nice haven from the madness, and perfect for a romantic getaway.

The hotel has a lounge where you can get tea and coffee 24/7 and home made biscotti in the afternoons. The breakfast was included and was a nice buffet with plenty of options.

Note that I\u2019ve rated it five stars, but that does not mean it was perfect in every way. Frankly, the full 5-star rating is for the service provided and not the hotel per se. Without a doubt, the service my wife and I received was superb down to the very last person, and I mean everyone \u2013 door man, housekeeping, maintenance, kitchen staff, front desk, you name it \u2013 insanely friendly, helpful, and courteous (and a special thank you to Victor \u2013 thank you so much). That said, the hotel itself was not what I expected. I say that not because it isn\u2019t a nice hotel, but because the photos you see online don\u2019t tell the complete picture. I\u2019m also not suggesting they are misleading, but in total, I don't think they provide a full visual description of the environment. Below are a few examples, with the understanding I mean these to be observations (not criticisms) so you have a fuller understanding of what to expect than I did. 1. The hotel is in a beautiful upscale residential neighborhood. You\u2019re surrounded by houses (many of which are mansions) and no commerce. This can be good or bad, depending on how you see it. In one sense, you feel like a resident of the city (good, IMO); on the other, you have no access to basic amenities (snacks, pharmaceuticals, etc) outside what the hotel provides (not so good). 2. You are literally at the peak of a hill, which, depending on your room, can provide you a spectacular view of either the city or Alcatraz/Golden Gate Bridge. The potential downside, of course, is that you walk up/down very steep hills in all four directions. If you\u2019re using public transportation, be prepared for very steep climbs on return trips because the bus system is one block over and one block down from the hotel. One block over and down doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal until you\u2019ve trekked up and down it several times in a day over a period of days. Bottom line, the hotel is probably not ideal for folks who aren\u2019t comfortable climbing very steep hills regularly but would like to use public transportation as their primary means of transportation during their stay. 3. The hotel is old. Beautiful old building and well maintained (functional, clean), but all the wood floors creak, many areas of the hotel have very uneven flooring, the hallway carpeting is worn down, the room windows are old and difficult to open/close, etc. Again, not a criticism, just an observation. I make this observation because the photos I saw of the rooms gave me the impression HD is a very modern hotel. Simply not the case. It seems more like a remodeled house that tried to retain its original flair. Probably better to think of it like a very large, charming New England B&B than a modern hotel. Depending on your travel habits and hotel preferences, this style may or may not suit you. If you\u2019re more accustomed to (and prefer) business hotels, I would suggest the Hotel Nikko downtown. Although it borders what looks to be a marginal area of town, it\u2019s 100% safe and in a really convenient location for getting around. On the other hand, if you like hotels with character and old-world charm, then I think you\u2019ll love many aspects of the Hotel Drisco. 4. As for the room itself, great mattress and bedding. A hotel for me above all else is for getting a good night\u2019s sleep, and no issues there. Couple of annoyances, though \u2013 the Internet connection worked only intermittently and the front desk seemed unable to sort it out. I don\u2019t spend a great deal of time on the Internet when traveling, but if you\u2019ve got to send an email, find a good restaurant on Yelp, or get bus routes from the hotel to a point in the city (511.org), it gets annoying quickly when you can\u2019t get Internet access as advertised. Another small but relatively annoying thing \u2013 you\u2019re issued a room key and minibar key on a keychain. Again, maybe it\u2019s old-world charm, but I find it annoying. I don\u2019t always carry a backpack or other bag, especially when I\u2019m out exploring, so it annoyed me I had to carry keys in my front pocket. Would much rather have had a room card that fits in my wallet. Again, though, that\u2019s just my preference. 5. Other points \u2013 limited but good breakfast in the morning: oatmeal, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, bagels, pastries, croissants, juices, cereals. Pretty standard fare, but good way to start the day. Apples in the lobby, water upon request, and a wine tasting each evening add to the charm and appeal. In sum, the service at Hotel Drisco was superb, but the physical experience was different than I had originally imagined it would be. Neither bad nor good, just different than my expectations.

In the evening we wanted to go for some dinner, there were a few places in walking distance but we decided to venture to union street as the giants were playing in the world series. It was another big walk to get to all of the bars and another taxi back to the hotel. Our room was pleasant but they had situated us on the ground floor right next to the dining room which we didn't like but as we were only there for 1 night I didn't say anything. The room was lovely and clean and at one point a lady came round offering us cookies and ice! Nice touch! There was also a wine reception in the evening which was again pleasant, but not for my partner and I. We felt the hotel was catering for an older audience than me (23) and my boyfriend (25). Stay here if you have a car and you're not too fussed on being close to where everything is going on.

I wasn't expecting such an old building though. I loved it for the charm, but you definitely hear people in the room above you walking around when the wood floors creek. The same with hallways - they creek loud and since the walls are thin it can easily wake you up. The beds were so comfortable though that it really didn't bother us... but I heard other guests complaining about the noise. The plumming was noisy. You could hear when anyone in a room near you turned on the shower as the walls are thin and pipes run through them. This DID NOT take away from the hotel for us. It didn't bother us and wasn't a bother... but at the price of the rooms I'm sure it would bother some. It's very very nice, offers a good breakfast with more than just pastries and coffee (fruits, cereals, breads/grains, jams, meats, cheeses, juices, etc.), and the beds and rooms are simply cozy. The amenities are great - honor bar (mini fridge where it's on your honor to tell them if you take something from it), nice HDTV with dvd player built in, free tour of your choice (not our style but nice to have it offered), comfortable beds, very nice bathrooms, bathrobes, and the list goes on. I recommend booking online through their website. it's very easy and you can actually find a better rate (deals with AAA, etc. that you can't get on a booking site). This hotel was sold out for our nights there so you should book months ahead if you can. Some ritzy snobby people stay at this hotel... I felt bad for the guy carrying this woman's luggage ordering him around where on the steps and outside she wanted each of her 7 bags for her 3 night stay. We don't fit in with that crowd, but in the dining room for breakfast felt like those were not the majority of people there. Even the staff made jokes about some of the rude guests - ha. This hotel was a splurge for us and if I'm lucky enough to get to do it again I will. The location can't be beat. It's only $10-$15 by cab to the majority of places you'll want to go... and less than that for many others. We chose to walk (yes up those hills) and didn't have much trouble. Such a nice area and so much fun! Despite what people told me here on TA, I didn't have trouble getting public transportation (Muni) from there.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cElegant property, excellent staff, horrible noise!\u201d", "Author": "NorthCarolinaAida", "ReviewID": "UR74494523", "Content": "A lovely hotel. A beautiful, sophisticated, intimate, historical, property in an amazing neighborhood with great architecture and restaurants. My room was perfectly clean and well appointed with nice toiletries and beautiful linens. One of the best rooms I have ever had based on cleanliness & style. The staff was exceptional. Management should be proud, as every single employee was personable, capable, and went above and beyond with recommendations, calling for reservations, advising and arranging transportation options, recommending best days and times for best activities. I especially appreciated tips for finding hidden gems around the city, special local favorites I would have otherwise missed. I was very impressed with the staff. Location on top of the hill is not easy for people unaccustomed to that kind of walking. I found it hard, but worth it. From what I could see, parking on the street was always available, however I did not have a car. Breakfast was nice, above average. Wine tasting was wonderful, and Julio is a great resource on restaurants. My only complaint, which is a big one, is the noise. I was in a street side suite, and the windows are single pane and believe me it is very noisy. The hotel is atop a steep hill, and you hear the loud struggle of every FedEx truck, car, late night taxi, and early morning construction vehicle. Not to mention wealthy neighbors that like to test drive their sports cars at 2 am. I was also disturbed a couple of times by other guests checking out early, dragging luggage in the hallway. My sleep was often disrupted, which is saying something since I was so tired from all of the walking! Overall, I loved this hotel because of elegance and the exceptional staff and strongly recommend with caution: Get a city view room, which are not on the street, and one on the top floor, so as to be disturbed by noise as little as possible. I urge management to find ways to soundproof the property. Only then will Hotel Drisco earn top honors.

A great way to start your evening before exploring SF and its amazing restaurants. The hotel is located in an exclusive area called Pacific Heights. It is a very quiet area with numerous elegant homes. It sits atop the hill with terrific views. Street parking is readily available as we had a car and had no problems parking. We took the car with us every day but if you leave a car there during the day note that there are time limits. 2-3 hour parking zones require that the car be moved. The front desk will move your car for you if you leave it. Just sign a waiver allowing them to do this. This is a great perk to have as an option. Public buses are very reliable and close by.

As a special added feature, the Hotel (along with other Joie de Vivre hotels) offers the chance to connect with a local volunteer guide.

Parking is on the street; you will have to move your car every 3 hours during daytime but otherwise incredibly safe and silent at night. Gorgeous building, elegant traditional design without being stuffy. Every window draped, swagged with rollerblinds that completely cut out the light. Saw ocean AND city from living room. Furnishings in room all top notch, big bathroom, high class toiletries, real size ironing board, good hair dryer, all the amenities right there. Breakfast in lovely dining room was excellent with fresh fruit, fresh OJ, various dairy products, eggs, and hot oatmeal (for vegans like me). Staff is incredibly solicitous and welcoming. The suite was a little chilly at first, but a space heater was brought in and then the central steam heat system kicked in (have that in my own residence, so no surprise, really). The bed was incredibly comfy, great down pillows, comforter, HDTV in both bedroom and livingroom, DVD player, well-stocked minibar - great lighting, great wireless connection - ALL WAS FLAWLESS.

It does seem odd that there are so many rave reviews and so many negative reviews. Unfortunately, my experience there fell into the negative review camp. I stayed in room 302. This room faces a light well, the view being into windows of other rooms and and adjacent apartment building. There is no ventilation in this room and it is thus airless and stuffy. The only way to get air is to open the windows. In doing so, you are now subject to non-stop noise from other rooms, i.e. cell phones ringing/being answered at all hours, sexual relations, conversations, baby crying, toilets flushing, TV, etc. The roller shade on the window was non-functional so light coming into the room was an issue all night. Air quality - around 4 a.m. fetid odors of burning food filled the room and were still present when I checked out at 9 a.m. All of this made for a miserable night and a less than refreshed sense of being for the work day ahead. I am reading a lot of \"you should have told us\" from the management responses to reviews in this forum. What is it that you could remedy in my list of issues above other than perhaps fix the window shade? When one has retired for the evening, there is no interest in taking on issues that cannot be remedied and should not exist in a quality hotel. I would imagine that if you are in an upper floor suite with and outward facing view, the stay here would be pleasurable. Management needs to come clean on the reality of their rooms, i.e. rooms facing a light well, no attached bath, etc. in their online descriptions and let the customer decide if these limitations are worth the price. In my opinion, they are not and as I would not put up with this again, I cannot recommend this hotel to others. The responses I am reading in this forum from Hotel Drisco management are somewhat troubling.

At check-in, Bob provided with us with lots of useful info regarding the bus services in the area as well as the amenities the hotel offered. He was also a font of knowledge for local restaurants as we decided to get takeway on our first night because of the weather! The breakfast was excellent - great coffee, bagels, bread, yogurts, pastries, fruit juices and cold meats and cheeses. There was also a wine reception each evening, though we never managed to be around at the right time. The hotel is in an upmarket residential area, so it's a short walk to bus routes or local bars/restaurants. Parking on nearby streets is free at the weekend, but the staff volunteered to move our car regularly to avoid tickets during the week - a real fringe benefit.

There was a turn down service and lovely high quality chocolate cookie to enjoy. Coffee, tea and iced water and afternoon cookies were freely available in the lounge. You could also take these to your room to enjoy if you preferred. There was also wine, nibbles, cheese and biscuits and some hot snacks available free, for 1 hour each evening. This was served to you in a most friendly manner and it was a nice opportunity to gain some local knowledge from the staff (particularly Julio) and also speak to other guests if you wished. The breakfast was also delicious and something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the hot porridge oats. To sum up this hotel: It is so obvious that the staff all enjoy what they do and are totally committed to providing a high quality service to the guests. It is an extremely tastfully decorated hotel and the cleanliness is an excellent standard. Pacific Heights is a lovely location in SF and it allowed us to explore the Filmore Street area, which we may not have done if we had stayed eg Union Square.

They had a complimentary town car service that would drop you to either Union Square or the Financial District in the morning. We found this very convenient. We got multi day muni passes, which were very economical and very well used. We would definitely recommend getting these, which you can purchase at the front desk of the hotel. We actually loved that this hotel was not in the usual, touristy areas. Not only does it get you away from the hustle and bustle of those spots, but it also allows you to see a part of the city that you may not normally see. Also, the town car service in the morning and the MUNI service will effectively get you to and from the hotel when needed. There are lots of great restaurants within the area, all of which seem to be much more local and much less touristy - which we liked. The hotel does not have a parking lot, but there is lots of parking on the streets around the hotel.

Specifically, upon check in I was upgrade to a phenomenal suite (room 103) that felt more like a private apartment than a room in a hotel. Also, when I pulled up to the hotel in my rental car, I parked in the temporary loading zone as directed. When I came back out to move my car, I found that I had been inadvertently boxed in by a tow truck that was picking up a vehicle to be serviced from a nearby home. The owner of the car and the tow truck driver both apologized and said that they would do their best to hurry, but of course you can't really rush something as important as strapping a 2 ton vehicle to the back of a tow truck! When the bellman stepped out of the lobby and saw that I was waiting, he offered to wait and then park my car for me, and then bring the keys back to my room! Talk about service! The hotel itself is located in historic Pacific Heights, with gorgeous views of the bay amid dramatic victorian homes. If you are concerned about being far from the traditional tourist spots (Embarcadero, Union Square, etc...) don't be - SF is not a very large city and cabs are both plentiful and affordable. Besides, this neighborhood is truly the most beautiful and unique. As mentioned above, I was only in town for one night and as such, was a little worn out from the hectic travel schedule. Hotel Drisco provided the perfect opportunity to relax: after I checked in I was able to enjoy the complementary wine and cheese reception downstairs from 5:00-6:30.

The suite consisted of a living room area with tv and a separate bedroom with a large bathroom and another tv. There was free WiFi! Our friends who arrived later didnt get a free upgrade but were offered one for a cost? We found the basic room a bit tight so when we stay there again (which we most definitely will!) we would book a suite. The complimentary breakfast included wonderful baked goods, toast, hard boiled eggs, cheeses and meats. Cappuccinos are available on request (I only knew since someone was having one). Afternoon wine, cheese and small hors douvres were an added treat. All staff were warm and friendly. The first night we walked to Fillmore Street (about 5 short blocks downhill) for dinner. There are wonderful shops and restaurants there. On our last day we walked a few blocks (major steep downhill) to Chestnut Street for another area of great shops and restaurants.

We were able to get a cheaper rate after joining the JDV members club. This was our first trip to San Francisco and we stayed for a week. I found the reception staff to be very polite and helpful - always greeting us when we were leaving or arriving back and always willing to provide help with directions, transport etc. The housekeeping was very discreet and always respected the 'do not disturb' sign. A special mention must go to Julio, the wine waiter at the daily wine reception. He seemed to take an interest in us and enjoyed hearing about what we had been up to each day and what our plans were for the next. He also went to great lengths to tell us how to get around as we mainly used the buses and cable cars when not walking. He even made a restaurant reservation for us when we asked his advice about where to eat. The evening wine reception was a lovely touch and the complimentary breakfast was welcome each morning and fresh, although it did become a little boring by the end of the week. Our room ( a king deluxe) was quite large as was the bathroom. The room overlooked the inside of the building but this didn't bother me as I had asked for a quiet room and I got just that. Although I know the other rooms had some great views of the bay. Besides we were out most of the time anyway. It was quiet at night and I never had any trouble sleeping, which was important to me after walking so much each day - all hills! The bed was comfy although the pillows were a little too high when using both but too low when using one! The hotel is situated in Pacific Heights which is obviously a wealthy neighbourhood and it was very peaceful at night. But the shops and restaurants on Filmore St are only a couple of blocks away and we got around easily by bus - there are a couple of stops within a block of the hotel either way. We enjoyed looking at the other beautiful houses and picking our favourites as we walked along. The hotel also provides internet access in the small 'business center' but they do charge for this - a bit of a bummer if you don't travel with a laptop. To summarise, I would say I really liked this hotel, it was great to come back each night knowing there would be peace and quiet and the staff were very professional. It was small enough to be intimate but we still had privacy.

When we made our reservation we were torn between booking two separate non-suite rooms or the adjoining two bedroom suite. We ended up going with the two separate rooms because of the giant cost difference. When we arrived at Hotel Drisco to check in, we were told that my parent's room had been upgraded to a suite, however both rooms were located in the basement, down the hall from the service entrance, across from an ice machine and the breakfast room. Our windows overlooked the kitchen of the hotel and the rooms were very dark. Needless to say we were disappointed and considered switching hotels, however the desk staff was able to move us both into an adjoining two bedroom suite on the corner of the top floor. The new rooms had beautiful light, gorgeous views of the Bay and Alcatraz and it was like we were staying in a completely different hotel. We loved, loved loved our new rooms. The adjoined two bedroom suites are great if you're traveling as a group, however one of the bedrooms in these two bedroom suites has no bathroom attached. You have to cross the private hall (to which both bedrooms in the suite have access) to get to the bathroom. If the person staying in the other bedroom is not traveling with you, you could conceivably be walking out of your shower into your room and pass a stranger in the hall. It was a bit bizarre. I would recommend this hotel ONLY if you are given a room on the top two floors. It would be quite loud otherwise, and much less private. The only problem is, you are given no guarantees as to where your room is until you check in. It's a bit of a gamble. Also, beware. The prices of rooms fluctuate. When we were moved to the double room suite, the price we were quoted at the desk was nearly $100 less per night than what we were quoted when we originally made the decision to stick with the smaller, single rooms. That said, bathrooms in both suites and non-suites were beautiful and large, the breakfast were very nice, and Thanh (sp?) the bellhop/doorman was so kind and friendly. We loved the private, neighborhood feel of Pacific Heights. There are some great nearby restaurants (try Sociale) and the buses run frequently if you're wanting to go further afield.

The street parking in our F-250 extended cab ranch vehicle was... well, exciting, but do-able. Google Earth didn't show the degree of slope on the side we parked on (STEEP!). Once inside it was a great experience from check in to check out. The staff was all very polite and friendly. We declined the \"view\" room upgrade (for a fee) we were offered (didn't think work would go for that!), but our inside room was more than adequate. I could hear the gentleman next to us talk conversationally on his phone to someone named Chris so the rooms could use a little boost on the soundproofing, plus the pipes clanked pretty much all night. Maybe this was why we were offered an upgrade? In the evenings we were able to walk the neighborhood unmolested and gawk at the mansions in the 'hood- we probably got the police called on us as we ogled from the sidewalk (hey- they light those homes so you WILL ogle!). We were able to walk to the Fillmore district for dinner one night so it isn't totally far from restaurants, but you WILL burn off the calories from dinner. We also walked down to the waterfront area down the Lyon Street steps and caught the cable car over to Union Square for dinner and a pint at Johnny Foleys. One weird thing about parking at the hotel is that the parking is street parking and therefore under the parking laws- it must be moved every three hours after 9 in the morning.

To my knowledge there is no air conditioning however it's likely not needed there most of the year. We simply opened the windows when needed to let in the wonderful bay breeze (the weather was in the mid to upper 70's, quite unusual we were told for that time of year - and much appreciated!!). We reserved the hotel's town car one weekday morning to go to Union Square along with another guest which was a fantastic service. The breakfast buffet was delicious (hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, bagels, breads, croissants, fruit, meat and cheeses) and our coffee was refilled at our table each morning. We also loved the 24/7 coffee, tea and water available near the lobby , especially after a long day of sightseeing! We were able to order food delivered from \"Waiters on Wheels\" which was very convenient when we wanted to relax in our room (though our choice was an unfortunate one -Gino's Pizza was the worst I've ever had). We would probably have been much happier ordering any of the panini offered by the hotel. The Hotel Drisco is in a beautiful neighborhood (Pacific Heights) and we enjoyed walking around to see the gorgeous mansions and views of the bay.

Also, there is virtually no insulation between rooms so if you have neighbors who like to watch television, be prepared to hear every word. I mentioned the noise problem to the front desk and asked if perhaps there was a quieter room. They informed me that I was in a quiet corner. I think they were right, comparatively speaking.

After experiencing a NASCAR type trip from the van driver thru the streets of SF, we made it and were greated warmly by Elizabeth the front desk associate. Bob (or was it Bill?) the bellman helped us with our overpacked luggage. Since we traveled most of the day to get there (we're East coast, not West), we wanted a quick bite before turning in for the night.. Bob (or is it Bill?) recommended a few places on Fillmore which more than met our needs. The next morning, we had breakfast downstairs in the dining room. A young man (name escapes me but he had a beard that needed a little help -- maybe a few more years might help) was there to assist the guests with more coffee, cleaning plates away and generally being helpful but not intrusive. Each evening, the hotel has a wine social for an hour. It's a nice way to end the day I thought. Strange, but few guests took advantage of this social. Maybe our east coast hours made it feel later than it was? Anyway, it was a great way to end the day. And the older gentleman who was there was more than helpful -- he was entertaining as well. I never did catch his name, but ask him about his 7 week tour of America last year or his reasons for moving to the US ( he's from Central America and came here when he was 25). My wife thought he was adorable. Checking out 5 days later, both Nancy and Thahn assisted with a cordial process. So, where does the NO to Drisco come in?

On the whole we were not disappointed - I would be happy to stay there again - the rooms are good, the neighbourhood very up market (a 10 minute brisk walk to shops restaurants etc.) and the hotel staff extremely pleasant and helpful. However given Drisco's current top rating on tripadvisor, which influences decisions, I feel it's okay to be a little nit-picking on a few points: Breakfast - rather disappointing - almost no fresh fruit (apart from a boring bowl of apples, bananas and oranges) Overall ambiance - the decor throughout the hotel is restrained and tasteful, and generally for an old building, it is well maintained. However it is all rather bland and hotel-like, and creates an atmosphere that is impersonal and stiff. The primness of the breakfast room for example, where very, very subdued generic orchestral music accompanies breakfast, drove the couple at the table next to ours to hold their conversation in whispers! So while Hotel Drisco serves what is probably its target market - middle-class, middle-age middle-everything - very well, it is definitely not the place for non-conformity - though in my opinion that is just what it lacks.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "kj1780", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel-but no A/C\u201d", "Author": "kj1780", "ReviewID": "UR20702726", "Content": "This hotel was absolutely lovely.

We've stayed in several very good SF hotels in the past, and based on the high tripadvisor rating I guess we were expecting a lot, but this hotel was a BIG dissapointment. It was OK at best. Very helpful doorman (not so much for the snooty front desk guy... seemed like new part-time staff). Rooms a bit cramped and LOTS of noise from creaking pipes, floorboards, and adjacent rooms. Also very cold since our in room radiator didn't seem to work despite someone coming to fix it... had to call for an extra electric heater. Mind you we had a discounted rate and probably got a poor room as a result(??). Breakfast was included and although we had trouble finding a seat, the meal was very good. Bottom line is that this is an older property in a very residential neighborhood without a lot of amenities. Decent lodging for the price, but my wife and I can't comprehend why it ranks so highly. We're a bit baffled. We didn't stay here the next weekend on our way home and we will not stay here when we return to SF in the spring. Again, not a bad hotel, but it simply doesn't seem to fit a top pick for SF, a city with so many fabulous hotels. We're thinking maybe top 100 would be more accurate.

We were given that room, which was very large, but it turned out to be too noisy for us since it was off of the main hall, very close to reception, and we were kept awake by conversations of lots of people returning to the hotel in the late late evening. The following morning, we requested a change of room to a quieter location. This request was accommodated quickly and pleasantly. Our luggage was moved to the new room for us. We loved the second room, even though it was smaller than our original room. The beds were very comfortable, and the rooms nicely laid out - with lots of mirrors and good lighting.

The hotel itself is a boutique style and this works wonderfully in it's favour - far too many chain hotels treat you as a number. At the Drisco the personal touch offered by the staff made us feel at home from the moment we walked through the door.

The rooms were very nice and were very luxuriously furnished (we wanted to bring the extremely comfortable bed back to the UK with us!!) Location wise you are about a 10 minute walk from Fillmore street where there are lots of nice places to eat and drink as well as some unusual but interesting shops. A little bit further along is the California street cable car stop where you can easily get around the city (it's also cool hanging onto the side of the cable cars and surfing the streets of San Francisco !!)

As a single woman travelling alone this is a very safe great area handy [by car or short cab] to Marina restaurants, the restaurants and cafes of Union Street and the restaurants on Fillmore Street. The one thing I have to mention is that you really need a car if you are staying at this hotel [or be prepared to catch cabs] as there are no shops or restaurants within an easy walk and the hotel is in a very hilly area. However parking is easy and plentiful on the street so it is no problem hiring a car and parking near the hotel. I just hired a car and was perfectly happy at the Drisco. I am a light sleeper and was able to sleep easily in this hotel. From time to time I would be conscious of a slight noise but it did not affect my sleep. Also I had no problem whatsoever with the water temperature in the shower - it was great. I had always intended to move to a hotel in the San Francisco CBD after 3 nights here as I had things to do in the city.

My partner and I booked two nights at the Drisco for a quick break over the Memorial Day weekend, and completely enjoyed our stay. The room was small (again, think hotels in Paris or London) but well appointed and the bathroom was pretty and clean with some additional amenities that I wish every hotel would offer, such as a toothbrush and toothpaste for purchase if you forgot yours, and some bath salts and shaving kits. The staff from bell hop to front desk was unfailingly nice and polite which made staying here a real pleasure; additionally the hotel adds some choice \"extras\" such as a complimentary wine and cheese reception from 5-7PM, which was very pleasant. They also have a very small gym which though small, has well maintained machines. The only reason I could suggest for passing on this hotel would be if you had never visited San Francisco before and had a very limited amount of time there (for example 24-48 hours) and that is only because of the location, which is not close to any major tourist attractions (Fisherman's Wharf for example) though it is somewhat close to the Palace of Fine Arts.

I was eager to check this place out given the very high ratings on TripAdvisor. Overall, Hotel Drisco did not disappoint. It has old world elegance minus the stuffiness found in some old world hotels. The staff was extremely accomodating and pleasant without seeming overbearing. The location is lovely...on a very quiet, upscale street in Pacific Heights. Our bed was very comfy, sheets soft. Like other previous reviewers, we were stunned at the fact that we were not once awoken by street noise. Honestly, it felt as if we were staying at a hotel in the countryside rather than in the middle of SF. It was that quiet! While this was a lovely hotel...I wouldn't rank it as one of the top places I've ever stayed. * I tend to prefer more modern decor and a slightly more casual environment. * I also like to know if I happen to be hungry \"after hours,\" I can get food delivered to my room instead of prowling the streets looking for a late-night takeout joint. * Our morning shower was unfortunately tepid which does tend to put a negative spin on the day (at least for me). * And I can't say I was that blown away by the continental breakfast--yes, it was good but I personally didn't find it to be anything out of the ordinary (aside from the delicious fresh squeezed OJ). That said, I most certainly would stay here again and we will be recommending this hotel to my in-laws who travel out twice a year from Ireland to visit.

We absolutely loved this hotel! We made our reservation months in advance and were thrilled to receive such amazing service and attention even prior to our arrival. Elizabeth at the front desk generously answered many e-mails with wonderful advice as to car rental, restaurants, and area attractions. Bob gracefully handled the front door greeting duties, welcoming us by name when we arrived. Our room was perfect. Room 406A! It was a two-room suite that had to be about 800 sq. feet. With the high ceilings, plentiful windows on two sides of the room, two flat screen TV\u2019s (one in the living room and one in the bedroom), very comfortable bed, and full amenities, we were most content. This particular room is reached by entering through a door into a private hallway. It was a very quiet room, something that is very important to us when we travel. In fact, we never heard another guest while in our lovely room. The furniture and draperies are simple and nice (not luxurious, but quite cheery and pleasant) and the rooms were immaculately clean. We thought the bathroom was beautiful. For a property as old as this one is, it was impeccably maintained. We enjoyed the little touches such as robes and slippers set out at turndown service along with cookies, bottled water, and the next day\u2019s weather report. We also liked the 24-hour coffee and tea available in the hotel\u2019s sitting room as we were able to take coffee to go when we set out to explore each day. It was a little warm our first night, though with the windows open and the fan the hotel provided, we had a most comfortable first night\u2019s rest. As room 406A is on the back left side of the property (which sat upon a very steep hill-it is San Francisco, after all), it felt like we were much higher up from ground level, providing unobstructed views of the city. If we peered out the living room windows and looked to the left, we could see the San Francisco Bay. We loved the spaciousness, peacefulness, and privacy this room provided. And the walks around the neighborhood (the expensive Pacific Heights neighborhood) were spectacular. In a simple mile-loop (the hotel provides a map), one can walk past mansions worth tens of millions of dollars. So not only can one gaze upon the beautiful San Francisco Bay on this stroll, but you can gape at the beauty of neighborhood dwellings. The Presidio park is also a block from the hotel, providing easy access to walks in the forest. We loved being able to park within a block of the hotel for free and access our vehicle whenever we wished. We also enjoyed the peaceful of this property versus staying within the craziness and congestion of San Francisco proper. Visits to most San Francisco sights were only a 10-minute drive. We would imagine some of the rooms whose windows looked out over the front entrance of the hotel might be exposed to the conversational noise of passing pedestrians or lingering hotel guests, but I suspect it is not a significant problem as it really is a quiet neighborhood with little street traffic. Breakfast is free every morning in the sunny and bright dining room with several copies of The San Francisco Chronicle, NY Times, and Wall Street Journal available to read. Breakfast is buffet-style with croissants, scones, cereal, toast, bagels, oatmeal, and fruit. Breakfast can also be delivered in your room at no extra charge. The service at breakfast as in the rest of the hotel was perfection. The staff was kinder than that at The Four Seasons properties at which we usually stay when we travel. When we visit San Francisco again, we will definitely stay here again for the personal attention of the staff, the privacy, the cleanliness of the property, the peace and quiet, and well, the \u201cbang for the buck.\u201d It was a positively fantastic value considering the level of service and lovely accommodations we received.

Before booking over the phone, we reviewed local hotels extensively. Priorities to us were value, tranquility, and personalized service. The hotel excelled in all. From the moment we arrived, hospitality plus was extended. We were able to check in early, and were given advice where to eat in the neighbourhood. Marti, concierge extraordinaire, suggested that we shop in the Union Street area after lunch. We did, had an extraordinary time with retailers who went the extra mile, and fell in love with Pacific Heights. While our room did not have an ocean or street view, we had two large sets of windows, one of which opened onto an inner courtyard filled with tropical plants. Our room was very quiet and large with a sitting area. Our suite was conveniently located down the hall from the dining room. We visited it two times daily for the wine tasting and incredible breakfasts. Julio and Omar, serving staff, went out of their ways to welcome us and make us feel like family. For example, after our a.m. arrival, Omar stopped me in the hall to ask if I would like some pastries with my coffee which I had been invited to take from the salon area on the main floor. Now that's service! Marti, the Concierge who took our phone reservation, remembered that our trip was in honour of my husband's birthday. After returning to our suite the first day, we found a 1/2 bottle of sparkling California wine chilling in a cooler of ice and a gracious note wishing my husband many happy returns from the Staff. How is that for attention to detail! The front office staff always had the time and interest to listen to our escapades when we returned from our daily explorations of SFO on foot. There was nothing they couldn't do for us. For example, when we came back on our last day and recounted our adventures to Bob the Bellhop/front desk staff yet mentioned we had not seen the Haight area, he quickly consulted the Internet and advised us which bus we could hop on a block away for the Haight.

The room was beautiful, with a small separate sitting area. Light filled the space and bounced off the crisp white linens as we entered the bedroom . We only had a few minutes to spend in the room before heading off to the wedding, but when we returned, the bed had been turned down, and light jazz was playing softly from the bedside alarm clock radio.

The location is a bit far from downtown (10 to 15 minutes by taxi), but the hotel has a free car service downtown each morning. Moreover, the residential local makes for a quiet and relaxed feeling. We even slept with our windows open last night. The view from those windows is the skyline of downtown SF. There is no dedicated parking, but parking nearby on the street has not proven to be an issue so far. There is also no restaurant or bar, so apart from the breakfast, the only food available on site are grilled sandwiches. The room is reasonably sized and very nicely appointed.

After I checked out the deal -- about $700 for three nights, with some minor extras -- I sussed out the hotel on TripAdvisor and at the time it was the top-rated hotel in San Francisco! Not bad. It had \"descended\" to no. 4 by the time we booked (still not bad) and so we committed. Loved it. The Drisco, as a cab driver who picked us up there commented, is the \"incognito\" hotel. If you want a Union Square location in the middle of everything, this isn't the place for you. But if you want to be in the heart of one of the most glamorous, beautiful neighborhoods in any city in the U.S., a relatively convenient walk from key city amenities like restaurants and shops, it's a great place. It felt very European. Cozy. Great service that starts with a call to your home a few days before arrival. \"Do you want to use our car service from the airport?\" For a $15 difference between hiring an ordinary taxi and using a dedicated car, we bit and it was worth it. When the driver pulled up in front of the hotel, on a peak crest of the hills overlooking the Bay, I thought it was a private club. It felt like that the whole time. Scrupulously well-maintained (and in fact they were upgrading rooms and suites while we were there with new carpets, flat screens and DVDs to replace existing electronics). Great bathrooms with deep soaking tubs. Nice amenities. With a quiet and lofty presence above San Francisco (our suite, living room with television, couch, cozy by-the-window chairs, and our bedroom, with a working desk, free Internet, another television, great bed, bathrobes and slippers) had great city views. The whole feeling was of a first rate hotel for those who like feeling comfortable, and even pampered, without pretension. At cocktail hour there was a wine and savories set-up, quite cozy (and we even brought in a local friend and no one batted an eye, only wished I remembered the name of the white wine because it was crisp and delicious). Breakfast was European in nature -- cold cuts, yogurt, oatmeal, made-to-order coffees, croissants. Included in, I believe, all room rates (though check on it). Adored the neighborhood -- with its multi-million dollar mansions, gorgeous greenery (even in February). Service at the desk was consistently excellent. I asked for taxis, for the exact color of the paint in the breakfast room (a very nice yellow, we're buying a new-old house and I love yellow), even asking for a promised-in-our-deal bottle of sparkling wine, which hadn't been delivered, was met with a gracious apology and fixed immediately. Would return to the Drisco, part of the Joie d'Vivre chain (and my first experience with this boutique hotel group) without qualification. The only qualification I will offer is that good news, bad news bit about the location. The neighborhood is gorgeous. But it's a good five to seven blocks (easy) from anything commercial. If you walk over to Fillmore Street, to Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow shops and restaurants, wear comfy shoes cause you're going to experience the hills that made San Fran so famous. Even more challenging: the Marina District below. It's in interesting mountain slog (up and down) to Lombard Street and points below, like Chestnut Street's restaurants and shops (I used to live in the Marina so I was more inclined to head downward this way). FYI, we had a great time at Curbside Two (again, a steep slog down toward Presidio), a fantastic small, provincial French bistro -- the weather was so crystal clear blue and warm weather crisp that I had my burger and fries (awesome) and glass of Syrah at a picnic table outside. It was a favorite off-beat place when I lived there and it was great to see it was the same. We had dinner at A16 on Chestnut Street in the Marina, which is currently a hot place; I was underwhelmed by this Italian bistro. We had a surprisingly romantic lunch at Emporio Rulli Gran Caffe, which reminded me more of the old fashioned kind of department store restaurants (in ambience, a bit\u2026old fashioned). But the food was excellent and so was the wine. A big surprise on the \"strip\". Didn\u2019t' get to Bistro Aix (it was closed on the nights we were there) but wished we had; the menu looked lovely. Next trip. Will just make sure I get a real series of workouts in steep, hill-climbing scenarios. And by the way: though we did have the pleasure of wandering the bay front around the Marina, we never did make it into the heart of San Francisco. Frankly, I felt like I'd found a heart where we were\u2026.", "Date": "February 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA room with a view\u201d", "Author": "BrendaWalsh", "ReviewID": "UR13348388", "Content": "We've just come back home to Sydney after a very pleasant stay at the Hotel Drisco of almost two weeks.

The only thing that I was so-so on was that we had a basement room. It would definitely be preferable to have a room on the upper floors (light/view, etc).

Only it's better than home because you have this wonderful staff to take care of you. Our favorite was Julio, the gentleman who served our wine during the afternoon wine reception. He very genuinely goes out of his way to accommodate your request. On our first night, my husband and I asked him for a restaurant recommendation. He recommended 2 of his favorites by providing menus, reviews and directions (we chose Cafe Maritime). On the second night of our stay, we decided to stay in. We had walked all the way to Fisherman's Wharf, the Ferry Building and back and we were too exhausted and achy to do much more than enjoy a glass or two of wine and climb into our very comfy bed. Julio made up a bowl of fruit for us to enjoy as an evening snack. Honestly, no hotel employee has ever made that effort with us before. We hope that hotel management appreciates what a gem of an employee they have! I've noticed a few reviews where mention is made of the hotel's \"out of the way location\" as if this is a con instead of a pro. To each his own.

Some of the other amenities we enjoyed: free bottled water in the room, the delicious cookies offered at nightly turn-down service, a customized tourist package, coffee and tea service offered off the reception area and the additional amenities offered for purchase in the room. I would suggest the wine reception hour be lengthened to allow travelers time to check in and still have time to enjoy this wonderful amenity without feeling rushed.

I looked forward to walking, and over the 3 1/2 days that we were in San Francisco my husband and I walked about 65 km (40 mi.). Buses are available to take you wherever you want to go (or back towards the Hotel) if you are too tired to walk back. Being on the crest of a hill, leaving the Hotel is the easy part - it is the return trip that can be challenging, and I am always amazed at just how steep the hills can be.

I wanted to commend Julio who presides over the evening wine aperitifs who made us feel like family and gave us some great advice on local restaurants and sights to see. I also highly recommend the Town car airport pick-up and drop-off - more expensive than the airport shuttle but worth every penny in comfort, convenience and conversation with Roberto.

This 3 night trip we decided to learn a new neighborhood and sought out the Drisco because it was in Pacific Heights and part of the same small hotel group as the Petite Auberge. It is located in on of the grandest \"modern\" residential streets in the city, and literally at the top of a very steep hill near the Presidio's east side. Though I was a bit worried that we would be too far away from things, our wonderful experience made up for any inconvenience of the location. There is a good bus line only 1 block away (down the hill) -we walked or used the bus to \"go\" places (especially the Fillmore Street shopping/restaurant area) - then usually got a cab back to the hotel -especially at night (as from the theatre) when we were tired. If climbing hills isn't on your agenda, a car or cab is a necessity. As others have noted, the front desk staff was FABULOUS - even loaning us a copy of a book detailing interesting walking tours in SF. Our \"King\" room was on the 2nd floor overlooking the street, but off in the far distance we could see the city,the Oakland bridge, and a bit of the Bay. We happened to be looking out our window the night Barry Bonds broke the home run record and saw the baseball stadium fireworks celebrating the event - magical. Our room was on a separate short hallway with another (corner) room- if you wanted 2 rooms as a \"suite\", I think (?) the hallway door to the main hallway could be locked. As the room windows faced southeast, our room was really sunny most of the day - VERY bright and cheerful (a white bedspread helped too). There were drawers for clothes under the TV and a HUGE closet (for a hotel that is). Some of the other reviews said the rooms needed renovation, but we thought ours was lovely. Though the usual snacks and drinks were for sale in the room, there was a complimentary bottle of water- nice. The extra \"special\" toiletries for sale were a bit pricey, but tempting (like fizzy balls for the bathtub). The room decoration was traditionally elegant, tending towards the restrained rather than fussy, with the bathroom reminding me of Restoration Hardware/Pottery Barn style. A newspaper is hung on your doorknob mornings in a trim canvas bag - a surprising little touch that indicates the management is really trying to make a stay pleasing. As the hotel is on a steep hill, the breakfast room (more like an elegant dining/living room) is in the \"basement\" but has large windows with view to the street...and a seating area in addition to tables for those who just want a coffee and to read the paper. The breakfast (included in room rate) had cereals/fruits/deli meats/ breads/drinks - very ample for a good start to the day. The only disappointment was that the \"wine & cheese\" in the late afternoon was in a smallish reception/living room and sparsely attended during our stay. In the Petite Auberge, the same event always had tons of people to visit with - exchange travel & tourist hints, etc. Perhaps our experience happened because we perceived fellow guests at the Drisco included families with children (8 yrs or so up- no little children) and under 35's, not the baby boomers / retirees more common at the Petite Auberge....But I wouldn't mark the hotel down for that as it might just have been the mix of guests during our stay. We booked on the Joie de Vivre group website and got a good discount for staying 3 nights. The photos from other guests give a good representation of the hotel's atmosphere. Even thought the Drisco is removed from the main tourist areas, there are many walks to take (Union Street, the Presidio, the Lyon steps, historic Pacific Heights, and close to the Exploratorium and Marina/ Ft.

The hotel is a quiet little gem hidden in a residential neighborhood. Here are some details that we found during our stay: 1. We had a suite on the second floor of the hotel overlooking the road. I was a bit nervous that we would be bothered by street sounds but we were not (I am a light sleeper). 2. The room was tastefully decorated and it appeared that our room had been updated recently as there were not many signs of wear. 3. The walls (or at least ours) were very thin. We could hear our neighbor snoring during the night which was more problematic than overlooking the street. 4. Parking: The hotel does not have parking but there is plenty of on street parking, however READ parking signs, they do street cleaning I think like twice a week and if you park on the wrong side you will end up with a ticket. 5. Breakfast: we were not aware that breakfast was included. I ordered a small pot of coffee and toast to our room and when we checked-out they said breakfast was included. It still seems a bit strange to me but it is worth asking about. 6. If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the tourist area this may not be the best choice.

This was our first trip to SF, and I agonised over hotels for some time, particularly weighing up a central location against one further out. In choosing The Drisco, I have no doubt that we made absolutely the right choice (given that we Brits are also mean, and thus will never spend more than we have to. In other words, its good value, as I do not have the requisite funds to lounge at The Mark Hopkins). While you could criticise The Drisco for being a little way out of the centre, the upside is that it is quiet (give or take the odd dustbin lorry, sorry, garbage truck at 8.00am), and you are in a very attractive (and achingly affluent) neighbourhood. In any event, a taxi ride is simple to arrange (thanks to the very helpful staff at The Drisco, sometimes up to 3 times a day) and the cost is very modest. You also then get to meet some of the miriad of interesting characters that SF has to offer, as the taxi drivers are a mirror of this cosmopolitan city, many amusing and charming, the odd one rude or mad, but always different. In summary for The Drisco - Excellent, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable and clean rooms with neat little touches of detail, modestly stylish decor that struck the right balance between neutrality and warmth, very good breakfast, emminently useable fitness room, and a place that you looked forward to coming back to. My gripe is purely the quality of the television programmes, but then thats hardly the fault of the Hotel. Oh, and more of their delectable free cookies would have been nice, but then thats simply me being greedy. And there are places within walking distance, providing you dont mind a bit of an uphill hike back to the Hotel. This includes a number of good restarants, but none better than Elizas at California Street - Authentic chinese, possibly the best I have ever tasted, and at ridiculously reasonable (or frankly low for us bearing in mind the pound's supremacy over the dollar at present) prices.

We were so happy, too, because the staff was so warm and wonderful with our little toddler, and greeted him with delight (as he did them) each time we returned to the lobby.

It is an old house so everything creaks, this may appear charming but at 4am in the monring if anyone moves it will be heard and wake you up. also the hotel has no air conditioning. Alot of houses in San Fran don't have air conditioning due to the cool weather but most hotels do. Even average hotels here in the UK will have air conditioning and its colder here than San Fran. So if you want some air you have to open the window which ensures you will be woken by the street noise, cars etc. The rooms are very small so they do get stuffy easily so you have to open the window. The location is also not great. Pacific Heights is a very nice suburb but it is not within walking distance to Union Sq or Fishermans wharf so you have to taxi everywhere. There is no taxi stop nearby so you have to ask the front desk to ring you a taxi every time you want to go somewhere.

It's a cute and quiet hotel with hospitable service. The hotel is located in the Pacific Heights section of San Francisco, which is a beautiful neighborhood, but an out of the way location for most site seers. We'd stayed two nights at the Arognaut Hotel prior to the Hotel Drisco and we both liked its location much better. The Hotel Drisco is a fine hotel and I recommend it for the traveler who doesn't mind copious amounts of walking or taking a taxi. The room was extremely clean, the breakfast was good, and it was nice to change hotel locations to see other parts of San Francisco. A jog through the nearby Presidio Park makes for an excellent early morning run. Parking around the area is not as bad as I had read.

I am used to staying at cheap, chain hotels and this one definitely had a leg up on any chain hotel. I had a normal room (not a suite) that looked out on a little courtyard. It was extremely clean and comfortable. It had a closet and a private bath. There was also an ironing board and iron which was great because I was staying in San Francisco for an interview, so I was able to iron my clothes. I had no trouble finding parking. The street parking is free but you have to move your car every three hours between the hours of 8am and 6pm Monday through Friday. This was not a problem as I left for my interview and then went back out for lunch and gas afterwards, so I was out and about anyway. There is plenty of parking within two or three blocks of the hotel. There were plenty of restaurants that delivered to the hotel and I ordered Chinese food out for diner the first night I was there. The food was tasty and reasonably priced. The desk has plenty of menus available depending on your taste. Also, there are plenty of restaurants down on Fillmore Street along with some shopping. I really enjoyed eating at a Mexican Grill that is on Fillmore, I think the name of it was La Salsa or something like that. The hotel is also very near a scenic walk with views of the city and the bay. There is even one point that if you walk down a little embankment near a funny curved driveway you can see the Golden Gate bridge. Just ask the people at the desk about what to see nearby. I also felt that the hotel was in a very safe location and I wasn't worried about walking around by myself during the day. The breakfast was fantastic, it wasn't a typical hotel continental breakfast. They had boiled eggs, oatmeal, toast, scones, etc. and very good coffee. It was served in a cute little dining room and a waiter cleaned up after me. Speaking of which, the staff was very nice and very helpful. One of the guys at the desk checked me in for my flight and printed my boarding passes so that I wouldn't have to pay for the computer/internet they have set up downstairs. He remembered me the next day and even asked me how my interview went. It was a fantastic hotel and I would definitely stay there again. However, I wouldn't trust the mapquest directions, I got lost on the way to the hotel. Call ahead and ask for directions because the clerk at the desk gave me precise directions back to the airport and I had no problem finding my way with their directions.", "Date": "April 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, CA", "Title": "\u201cIntimate, boutique,wonderful amenities\u201d", "Author": "ricardoanddinah", "ReviewID": "UR4823354", "Content": "I lived in San Franciso several years ago and have had the opportunity to stay in and visit a lot of the local hotels over the years.

First of all the Pacific Heights area is really residential, quiet and old world elegant. There are many absolutely gorgeous homes in the surrounding area. One can see the water views standing on the street corner outside. With that said, if you are the typical tourist, it's really not that close to any touristy spots. I would venture to guess that Union Square is a good 25 minutes walk (up and down steep hills, btw), as is Fisherman's Pier. It's not convenient to any of the trolley stops either. There's a complimentary car service to Union Square in the morning, but the rest of the time you have to find your own transportation. The decoration of the room is tasteful and elegant. Very comfortable bed but very stiff robe and slippers for some reason (need fabric softener!). Secondly, I don't know if it's the location of my room, but starting from 6AM I can hear my neighbor walking in his room, getting ready in the morning. The floor board creaks mercilessly and sounded like a herd of elephants stampeding. Needless to say I got no sleep from that point on. Third, there is no central A/C or heat. A/C may not be a problem since S.F. doesn't get that hot in the summer, but the kicker is that when the radiator turned on at 7AM in the morning it gave out such loud pinging noises that I thought someone was doing remodeling work next door. The breakfast, although touted as gourmet, was nothing to write home about. It's the basic starch, plus boiled eggs, although set in a very elegant dining area. The service was outstanding. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly without being intrusive. I was impressed when they called and paid for a taxi cab ride when the complimentary ride was running late. I think in sum this is a great place if you want efficient and friendly service, great for a romantic weekend getaway but I would advise bringing your own car to get around town and a set of earplugs to handle the noise problems (due to the old building's infrastructure).", "Date": "March 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cExtraordinary service at Hotel Drisco!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4715547", "Content": "I had been looking at small, upscale boutique hotels located in a quiet section of San Francisco.

All requests were met with a smile and without question from making restaurant reservations to small room repairs. One of the faucets in the bathroom was not functioning properly and I informed the front desk. I expected to have a washer replaced, but instead received a completely new faucet set. The breakfast that is provided was quite enough to satisfy my needs and very tasty. The only thing that people should be aware of is the only parking is on the street and is restricted during the day. I had no problem finding a space in the evening though.
