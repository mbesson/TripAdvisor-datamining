W used the car service provided by the hotel and while pricey by Istanbul standards (35 euro each way) it provided great piece of mind. The room is ok, fairly similar to other European hotels in Rome, Paris etc for the same price. Th breakfast buffet is ok again on par with other European hotels. The only issue we had was that the room was not swept for the first three days of our stay. A minor complaint really. Overall the staff were exceptional and the service was outstanding. We were skeptical of the tour that veysel told us about - the 70 euro all day boat and dolmbahce palace tour but in the end we were so glad we took it, the palace was amazing (more beautiful than Versailles by far).

The place is also a good 2 hr or more from Sabiha G\u00c3\u00b6k\u00c3\u00a7en airport. We stayed in two separate room during our stay, the first room that we got was cramped but comfortable enough. There was not much of a view and also you can expect noise because of traffic. We got a different room when we were leaving Istanbul, and that room was much more spacious. Breakfast served was good, and the view from the breakfast room is excellent. The breakfast is served at the top most floor in the hotel.

Although we booked through Orbitz, the room assigned us had to have been one of their better rooms. Our room was kept very clean during our weeklong stay. Leaky shower stall (must be under the shower base) meant a wet bathroom floor, and it was of no use asking for extra towels to sop up the water. Our bathroom had a bad odor (not through our doing!) which I think has to do with a lack of traps on their grey water fixtures (such as shower) and the fact that the bath floor drain seems to be tied directly to the plumbing vent stack. But what do I know as I'm not a plumber by trade! Unlike some other TA reviews, we had a desk chair in our room. If you do not, I'm sure you could ask for one. Free promised \"welcome drink\" never materialized. Great location with easy access to the recommended sites as well as the tram line. If you are using the tram, I'd suggest walking up hill toward Topkapi and using the Gulhane tram stop. Excellent and friendly staff. They'll try to sell you on package tours, but just say you are doing them on your own. The short Bosphorus boat tours in particular are about a third the price of the hotel offering. Good restaurants in the area including Imbat and Faros. Breakfast doesn't seem to vary from day to day, but is more than adequate with good variety.

I have just returned from a 4 night stay and I'm sorry to say I could not recommend this hotel. The hotel experience took away from my otherwise very enjoyable visit to Istanbul. It started right at check in when the duty manager mixed up our reservation, saying we had booked twin beds, until I could see nationality 'japanese' and realised he was looking at wrong booking. I felt he was pushing boat cruise and didn't spend enough time with general directions and orientation. Overheard another duty manager checking in guests and it was done much more efficiently and with greater care. First impressions are so important and ours fell short. It took us 2 days to realise just how close we were to the main sights because of his oversight! The 'superior' double room is very small and apart from one soft stool, it doesn't have any seating. Small seating space around check- in desk not conducive to lounging around so not a good hotel to spend time in other than a place to lay your head. I have never had an issue with breakfast before, there has always been something I could eat, but only had 2 breakfasts, and that was 2 too many.... orange drink was vile and coffee unpleasant. Apart from bread and jam, there was nothing I could eat. Cheese tomatoes, olives, hard boiled eggs sprinkled with dried herbs are not foods that i relish for breakfast. I didn't find any of the Duty Managers particularly helpful. I tried and failed to do my return flight check in, on-line, on a laptop in the lobby with a Manager behind the desk in front of me. He offered me no assistance with the very slow, non functioning computer and I had to head down the street to local internet cafe to complete the task! Four star hotel????

Veysel on reception was especially cheerful, helpful and friendly which really made my stay at the hotel even more enjoyable. It was also ideally situated for both sides of the Golden Horn, so going to sights in Sultanahmet and surrounds or Galata and Beyoglu was easy by foot or tram, and walking to Eyup and Galatasaray was also easy to do. There was a great little cafe across from the hotel for a great Turkish coffee at the beginning or end of the day, and a little bar next door.

The staff were friendly and very helpful, looking after everything for us from taxis to printing boarding cards. We couldn't praise them enough. The hotel's location is fantastic if your main aim is to visit the old city, most of the main tourist sites are a short walk away. Our room was clean and spacious, with maybe our only criticism being that it was very warm at night, even with the air con on. But that's only a minor point. The only meals we ate at the hotel were our breakfasts, but there was plenty to choose from and if anything we probably over did it! To cap it all, our transfer back to the airport managed to deliver us half an hour early for check in, through evening rush hour Istanbul traffic. That must be a record.

The area it is located in is pleasant enough and near to a range of good restaurants. There is free access to the internet in the reception area. I would describe the hotel as 3 stars. It lacked the finesse for anything more. The restaurant is only adequate - the food is basic and unvaried. I was bored with it on my first morning, and it did not get any better. This was disappointing given the high standard of food found in the city (it costs 15 Euros if you pay for it). You have to pay extra for expresso coffee and fresh orange juice (come on Gulhane Park - make it free). The mini-bar is typically expensive and the hotel only wants to be paid in Euros. The toilet next to the restaurant has a horrible smell as if the drains are not functioning properly - avoid. Lastly, the air conditioning in the room was not powerful enough - we were too hot even in late October. Perhaps this was an issue just in our room.

Breakfast was excellent, with a good variety of hot/cold items. Nice roof terrace with view up to Hagia Sophia. Very central, only 6 mins walk to Sultanahmet and al the main sights, and about 8/10 min walk to Sirceki and the Bosphorus.

There are works and construction going out directly outside the hotel which can be noisy at times and inaccessible. Inside the hotel the lobby, restaurant and rooms are clean and tidy, befitting a 4 star hotel. We paid and booked for 10 rooms and everything was confirmed by email; but when we arrived to our horror the manager Mr. Sonar said that they only have 9 rooms left and have put extra (portable spring beds - very uncomfortable) into the rooms to accommodate for the additional guests. We were NOT happy about this. Overbooking is not uncommon at this hotel. In the end one of our guests had to sleep in the changing room area of the Hammam and Sauna! After 2 days had passed, they no longer serviced or cleaned our rooms anymore. The bathroom toiletries were not topped up and the rooms were left as they were, resulting in beds not made, tea cups unclean and running out of Shampoo. The sink and shower plug holes are always blocking up! So the rooms are clean and pleasing when you arrive, but soon decay! Wifi is included for free which is a bonus. The Topkapi, Aya Sofya and Sulten Ahmet are all within walking distance saving you taxi fares. There are plenty of restaurants and some may want to visit McDonalds which is around the corner. The hotel also provides a menu for in room service which is not that expensive. We recommend this hotel for couples on a small-average budget. For large groups I would not recommend it due to our experience based on feedback from 29 people. Overall a nice hotel but be very wary of compromise and nitty gritty issues plus additional costs that you may incur at the end of your stay. You may have to chase up room service and toiletries if you want your room cleaned daily. Unfortunately, this hotel has so much potential, let down by the constant feeling that they want to squeeze out of you as much as they can. Compliments go along way with guests.

This is just amazing. Many thanks to the cleaners! Bad things: - Sauna wasn't free. Paying for sauna is really strange for a Finnish person but yes, it's our own fault that we didn't notice the fee before actually going to the sauna twice :) - Our room was the last one on the corridor and the Wifi didn't work very well. Also, the speed wasn't that great. Sure, we did have multiple laptops online at the same time and streaming music from Spotify etc. - Fresh orange juice costs 5 liras in the breakfast when you can get similar stuff with 1 lira from outside. - There was probably something wrong with the air conditioner as even we put the temperature to 5 degrees celcius, there was still like 30 degrees in the night so we didn't really get much sleep. We did turn off the air conditioner for one night and it wasn't hot anymore but then the air got very moist. But, we didn't complain about the air conditioner to the reception so this is mostly also our own fault. - Hotel has the slowest elevator in the world. You can take stairs twice in the same time as it takes to use the elevator. - Water pressure in the shower was pretty low. Ok, there was more things listed in the bad things than in the good things but for the price we payed, I think it was actually pretty good. Also, the bad things are actually pretty small issues.

For example, we sat down for drinks in their bar and found ourselves getting the hard sell about a Turkish Night dinner they could arrange or another restaurant they could book. This went on for 15-20 minutes before we even got our drinks. The worst, however, was on the last night of our stay when we asked if a cab could be arranged for 6am to take us to the airport on the Asian side. The guy at the front desk insisted that the trip was so long that no cab would take us there and that they would need to arrange an airport shuttle for us. They insisted the trip would take at least 1 hour and 15 minutes and possibly longer, so the over $100 we paid to the guy at the front desk didn't seem outlandish.

First of all, you couldn't ask for a better spot in the not-as-touristy section of the tourist district. You're within a five minute walk (ten if you're slow and have trouble with hills) from the Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque, and just around the corner from the Topkapi Palace. Sirkeci train station is around the other corner, and the little side-street behind the hotel opens up right onto the G\u00c3\u00bclhane tram stop, which will take you most places. G\u00c3\u00bclhane Park Hotel is not on the main road, so you don't get the noise from the street traffic, and yet isn't hard to find as it's not very far into the side-street maze behind the station. You'll find the staff are very acquainted with tourists of all kinds, so if this is your first time in Istanbul - or even your first time abroad - the staff will answer even the silliest of questions and help you do things as simple as make dinner reservations, or call a museum to find the opening hours. The staff are a very small group of about six front-desk personnel, two dining staff, and three cleaning staff (as far as we could tell). The staff are all excellent English speakers, helpful, polite and pleasant, though sometimes we felt that the cleaning staff were particularly displeased when we put up a do-not-disturb sign before going down to breakfast. They seemed quite determined to get all the rooms clean by noon, and we preferred to eat first then get ready to go out. They knock on the doors before coming in, but if you're in the shower after breakfast you might want to let them know. The front desk is always attended. Don't be shy with putting money in the tip-box on the front-desk counter, with someone watching, so as to let the staff know how much you appreciate them. We gave a grand total of about 70YTL in tips at the end of our 10-day trip, though we wonder if perhaps one fellow at the front desk would have been a little more pleased to see us if we'd have tipped him earlier in the trip for helping us with bags and getting settled in. Breakfast is a simple but sufficient affair, with a Nescaf\u00c3\u00a9 machine putting out palatable instant coffee (with or without milk) and hot water for plain black tea in bags. The breakfast is mostly the same day-to-day, from 7:30-10:30, and after ten mornings we became aficionados of olive paste and a small range of Turkish cheeses. The yogurt is delicious. The bread is better untoasted. We couldn't identify what the sausage was made of. Every morning everything will be fresh but teh same selection, except maybe a dish or two that's unlike the ones the day before. The breakfast room can get crowded in the later hour of about 9-9:30. We did not eat at the restaurant for other meals, and did not try room service. There's no point - Istanbul has plenty of great food to be had wherever you go, so why stay in the hotel? Very nearby are some good places to get a quick meal or a late meal (Faros Restaurant on the other side of the tram tracks just off the corner of the little street leading to GPHotel is a good place to get some good non-Turkish food and has a kitchen open very late). Generally, the hotel is on the spartan side, with no-frills rooms that are clean and simple, without very many amenities. Nice pillows and warm blankets, though. We traveled in February so we're not sure how sufficient the air conditioning is, but it was warm and cozy through the cold late-winter weeks. (Bring an umbrella if you plan on visiting between January and April.) There is a safe in the closet, which we used, but at no point did we feel unsafe about leaving a computer or camera or cellphones lying about the room when we were gone. NOT SO POSITIVE POINTS: If you are accustomed to a certain level of luxury or have a refined sense of design you will not immediately see the charm of this tiny, beige-and-olive-green hotel. The rooms are very small, and the bed takes up most of the space. The bed is large enough, but can be on the lumpy side. The pillows are plentiful but a little too puffy. The bathroom is clean and well lit but the shower is TINY, and it's hard to turn or move without bumping something. The water is nice and hot, though. The shampoo and bath soaps are not great quality, and they don't necessarily get replenished often. The water is not potable (according to the sign above the sink) but it isn't too foul to brush your teeth with. It is quite chalky. The hotel leaves a bottle of water free of charge on the first day, but does not continue to do so every day. Be prepared to buy at least 1 liter of water (1-2YTL's worth) per day. The hot water boiler is small, and the tea and coffee packets are also not replenished once you've used them. There is only one room that actually overlooks the park, and if you don't have that one, you'll be looking at the carpark. If you MUST have a good view, don't stay at this hotel. If you're not a blob who stays in the hotel all the time you won't care about the ducks on the roof across the carpark or the lack of any greenery because all you really need to do in the hotel is sleep and shower. The good views in Istanbul are plentiful outside the hotel. There is, however, a very good chance of noise from the carpark at night, such as car alarms, passers-by talking loudly, police sirens, angry ducks, angry cats and the like. If you are given a room near the elevator don't be surprised to hear the awful elevator music through the hall and your door. It is quite loud. Also foot traffic and people talking in the hallways is audible from rooms by the staircase and elevator. We did not try the \"hamam\" or the gym, downstairs, but from what we gathered the hotel wasn't particularly proud of them. They are not free of charge. The bar is not worth trying, what with a whole new city to explore right outside. Often there is the smell of cigarette smoke in the downstairs lobby late at night, which comes from the one bar patron who may be someone at the hotel's cousin or brother. IN CONCLUSION: if you're looking for a budget hotel with all the basics covered in a nice location and with English-speaking staff, but are not expecting the Ritz, then this is the hotel for you.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cLovely experience at Gulhane Park Hotel\u201d", "Author": "TravelmateMumbai", "ReviewID": "UR54473960", "Content": "From Alwyn and Lana Dsouza, India We have just returned from a trip to istanbul and ,stayed for 4 nights at the Gulhane Park Hotel.

The Hotel itself is very well located ,close to the Sultanahmet area and within a 7- 10 minute walk from the major attractions like the Blue Mosque, Ayasofya , Topkapi Palace and Bascilica Cistern. Another advantage is the hotel's proximity to the tram station (Gulhane Park tram station is just 200 metres away) from where one can travel (within a cost of TL 1.50 i.e.~ US$ 1.50 per person,oneway), towards Kabatasand the waterfront area for cruises on the Bosphorus or Princes Island in the Marmara Sea. The rooms were decently sized, similar to other European boutique hotels.. sufficient for a couple, but probably crowded for a fgroup of three or more people. The bathrooms however are tiny. The complimentary breakfast included sufficient number of items to satisfy most guests. All in all a very satisfying experience, and we would definitely recommend this hotel to future visitors to Istanbul.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bahrain", "Title": "\u201cI had a nice stay in Istanbul at Gulhane Park Hotel\u201d", "Author": "peralaperala", "ReviewID": "UR54465565", "Content": "After falling in a trap travestied as a four-star hotel in Istanbul (booked via internet), I decided to take a friend's advice and, after visiting Gulhane Park Hotel and getting acquainted with its accommodations, I immediately moved to it with my family.

Its staff is always ready to help you day or night, especially Miss Tug\u00c3\u00a7e, which is even capable of speaking some Portuguese just to make you feel at home.

The location is excellent, tram stop very close, a great bar one street up, plenty of restaurants in the area if you don't feel like a trek. Hotel staff are very kind and attentive, thank you to Erol and Tugce especially. The rooms are small (we decided they were 'cosy') but clean and all the usual amenities. Breakfast was ok, but don't expect 5* dining, coffee and eggs, bread and pastries were all fine and filling. There is no view to speak of - apart from the car park - but I'm sure in the summer months, the roof area would offer a view should that be a priority. (closed when we went). We made use of the bar twice, but no-one else seemed to frequent it, making it a bit flat. I would recommend this hotel if you want to experience Istanbul without spending a fortune. I would not recommend the massage service, it is not worth the money, not very professional and although my husband and I booked different massages, his costing 10 euros more, they were identical. I had bruises on my back and did not enjoy the experience. As someone who teaches massage, I am in a position to comment on this - take note! A final piece of advice - we were ripped off by a taxi driver, he took a 20 lira note and then handed the note back saying it was ripped (it was, but it wasn' t the note we had handed over) then tried to get another 5 lira through confusion in giving change. We ended up with the ripped note which no-one wanted. The journey bback to the hotel cost a third of the outward journey. Also watch out for the shoe-shine guys who drop their brush as they pass you - it's in your good nature to pick it up and run after them, they then 'give' you a shoe-shine, in thanks for doing a good deed then demand cash!!

We still enjoyed the marvelous view and the Mosque soundscape from the rooftop at dawn and dusk. The staff was lovely - helpful with directions and patient with our requests for pronunciation of our very few Turkish words. My only dissatisfaction was with the 'spa.' They have made a very clever use of space downstairs for a workout room, hammam and spa facility.
