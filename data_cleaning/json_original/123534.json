First time we stayed was in 2007 and it was for one night and got upgraded to club level, 2nd time we stayed was in a deluxe room on club level for 7 nights. The most recent was August 2011 for 7 nights in a garden view with club access. After getting upgraded the first time to club we found it hard not do anything else so its club for us any-more :) This is not your typical 5 star resort but its more layed back without being in your face kind of way. Rooms are clean , fresh and suits everyone's need love the coffee pod maker and always got extra hot choc of the cleaner. The only thing there is no set time for rooms to be cleaned and it can be late when they are cleaned but the was only twice out of the 7 days we were there. All staff we encountered were always smiling and seemed happy to be enjoying the job they were doing. From valet to lounge staff each would take time out to chat to ya. Lynn in the club lounge was great booking spa treatments for my mom in the portifino even given her a discount code. My mom and 2 treatments and would not recommend them for the prices they were charging. The hair dresser seemed less interested and was not great. Early entry to harry potter was a heaven given it was peak season though it amazed us at the crowds there at 7am. Club level snacks, drinks, breakfast and dessert got us through our day with very little money spent on food. Pool area is great, loads going through the day and night and there is something to keep everyone occupied. Drinks and snacks at the pool a little expensive but not that bad considering the service and location. Cabanas by the pool are a great way to spend the day by the pool and can highly recommend the Steve wonder one for location and theme. Security by the pool at weekends is strict and your room key has to be shown to gain entry. Express pass is the only way to do universal and its included with your room cost. 5min walk to parks or you can get a boat or rickshaw. It must be good if we keep going back, Thanks again to Kellen and his staff for making our stay memorable.

But, we enjoyed our 2 days at Universal and made the most of our days in the theme parks. Our longest wait was 10 minutes and we got to ride 3 times in a row the Harry Potter Ride with no queue at all...So the price for the room makes for the extra time you get to spend on rides. The park gets crowded around 11AM so make sure you wake early and are the first one at the gate! Also, you may choose to do all the \u00b4get wet\u00b4 rides together and go change at the hotel if the weather is not that warm. If you don\u2019t want to get wet, I suggest you buy a plastic poncho and have it ready to use in your backpack.

We got in the parks 1 hour before openeing with room key and also served as express pass for almost all of the rides and attractions. Having the fast pass was the best part of our trip! Wouldn't ever go without it! Hotel restaurant The Kitchen had great food, but menu was pricey. Wait staff were exceptional as well. We treated ourselves to the buffet breakfast one day ($19 adults, $10 kids) and were not disappointed. An amazing buffet and worth every penny. The convience store/starbucks in the basement was overpriced ($7 for water bottle) so we just didn't go there. The poolside has a large ice cold water cooler with lemon slices filled all day long that we just used to refill our water bottles poolside. Beach Bar was great but also very expensive! Poolside activities, slide and water activities all day long for kids of all ages. DIVE in movies and night beach volleyball were a hit for our kids.

Without early admission, it is difficult to get on the Harry Potter ride. I guess I should also put on the recommendation list all the Rock memorabilia. I enjoyed walking around the hotel and reading Rock history. But the hotel is not very nice. The grounds are beaten and not maintained. I saw garbage in the bushes and dead plants in the beds. Our room had the very smallest bathroom they could design, the kind where the door must have been measured precisely so it just barely misses the toilet. The pool is almost entirely 3- 3 1/2 feet deep so there is no swimming. You basically stand in the pool and drink. Great having a band poolside, though. The waterslide was good, but the water where you dump out is only 3 ft deep! I hit the bottom. It is probably a good place for the 18-30 year old crowd to drink hard at a nonstop party. But, alas, I am too old to enjoy the drinking hard scene. I would rather spend more and stay where the hotel is cleaner and quieter, where the pool is deeper and more fun, and where the food is better. The Hilton Orlando, with its Lazy River pool and clean spacious surroundings comes to mind (and it is probably cheaper), as do the nearby Ritz-Carlton and the Hilton/Waldorf Astoria at Bonnet Creek. The only reason I would stay here again is to get early admission to Universal. I might even stay at a different hotel but also book a room at the Hard Rock so I can claim the early admission.

We went to celebrate my son's 15th birthday and the hotel did a great job of making him feel special including a room upgrade (which we appreciated), a slice of birthday cake and a free sundae (both which he loved!). My family of five (11, 13 & 15 yr olds) loved everything about the resort. The music/entertainment that played in the pool area kept us all enjoying the experience despite the cool, cloudy weather. The Express Pass though was the best (free with hotel stay on site) - we never waited in any lines in the height of March Break on a Friday and Saturday. The equivalent cost of the Express Pass is the cost of the room for one night. We ate dinner at an italian restaurant at Portofino Bay which was recommended by the concierge.

And that is the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. We knew going in how much the rooms were and what was included. Still, after experiencing it, totally was not worth it. It was about $100 more per night for some snacks, a light breakfast, a few drinks and the fitness room. I could have picked up a few snacks from the snack shop for way less. I ended up running up from the pool to get sodas and snacks there. Really at that price, parking and/or internet should be included. Though there was a computer and printer in the lounge to use. The staff in the lounge were all very friendly and helpful though. We did get a garden view room this time and had a much better view than the pool view last year. LOL! So go figure. We could have ended up with a parking lot view. It just depends on luck of the draw. Unless I'm at the ocean, I don't think a view matters much to me.

That being said, I purchased the VIP Access Pass through Hard Rock in the hopes that I might get a room upgrade for my vacation. My husband and I traveled with another couple and arrived prior to check-in. When we registered, we inquired about the upgrade and were told that the hotel was fully committed. We understood but, when we came away from the front desk, the other couple told us they were asked if we'd like adjoining rooms. At that point, I was confused and, quite frankly, upset. If they couldn't offer an upgrade, how could they offer adjoining rooms? If they're booked, they're booked. So, when the rooms became ready, we again asked about an upgrade and again were told nothing was available. Being in the industry, I was expecting to be offered to be put on a list for a possible upgrade during our stay, but got nothing other than, \"We're fully booked, here are your room keys.\" When we looked at the keys, we saw the name of the other couple on the folio. No apology, no nothing; they simply crossed out the room number and wrote the correct one on it...or so we thought. When the other couple tried to call us and gave our name to the operator, she insisted she couldn't connect them because the front desk had them listed as us, and vice versa. When our friends tried to get into their room initially, they had been given 2 sets of keys...one that didn't work (which were actually to OUR room) and their set. Just poor, poor front desk service all the way around. When we got off the elevator, the hallway carpet was absolutely filthy, and I thought we were in for the stay from hell, what with the problems with the front desk already setting an extremely negative tone for the start of the vacation. However, when we opened the door to the room, I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were bright, clean, fresh, large, and appeared to have been recently renovated. Ours was the last room on the end, and I thought the stairway noise would be overwhelming, but we had absolutely no noise trouble whatsoever. The beds were the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on, and I have a Sleep Number bed at home.

A lot of \"I don't care\" attitudes from employees - Rooms (see below) - Pool area too noisy if you're trying to just relax The Awful When we arrived we decided we might do better in a kid suite rather than trying to cram 5 into a standard room. We asked for an upgrade which cost us an $150 extra per night (this is on top of the $375 or so per night we had already paid). The furniture in the room was very worn and dirty. The sofa sleeper had questionable dried white stains on it on the cushions and dried booger looking stuff on the side. GROSS! Would not expect anyone to sit on this, let alone sleep on it. How does this type of thing get by housekeeping? Reported the problem and was put in a different suite. This one wasn't much better. No gross looking stains on the sofa, but still very dirty & dusty. Obviously hadn't been cleaned in quite some time. Worn out upholstery and sagging cushions. Mold in bathrooms, broken shower door, scratched up furniture. Problems are not just wear & tear, but cleanliness. Ended up putting sheets on the sofa & chair so we could at least sit on them. I felt like I should report the issues directly to management (Steve) to make sure they were aware of their housekeeping issues and at least voice my dissatisfaction with the condition of the accomodations. He offered to move us again, but after seeing 2 bad rooms, figured a 3rd wouldn't be any different. He compensated us by cutting upgrade fee in 1/2 for the 1st night, comping the rollaway (it would have been an extra $25 per night) and giving us $200 in hotel comps to use around the property. No compensation was on the bill the night before we checked out so had to go to front desk to get it worked out which involved pulling manager back in for verification. He didn't recall what he had told us two days earlier because he had forgotten to make a note on the account. Took awhile to get it squared away. Hard Rock needs some attention. When I pay $400/night for a hotel room, I expect it, first and foremost, to be clean, no matter what the room cost. That said, if cleanliness is important to you, you might want to consider one of the other two on-site hotels until Hard Rock bucks up and deals with their housekeeping issues and updates the rooms.

Also, it was so much fun, the music at the pool was great, the restaurant outside was very good, the movies at the pool at night were a big hit with the kids, the Emil restaurant where you could just run in and get quick food worked great when you were on your way to the park. That was just the time we spent at the hotel but it is a perfect location to visit the park. You can walk in 10 mins or take a water taxi or get a bike taxi. The hotel in on the park site so you can get in 1 hour before the park opens to the public which allowed us to get to the Harry Potter World before the crowds, we did not have to wait to get on the rides there at all.

The rooms were nice, comfy beds & kept quite clean but not any different than any other hotel. There are no refrigerators in the rooms, unless you want to pay $15 extra to request one. There are public laundry facilities on the 2nd & 4th floors. There is a Keurig coffeemaker in the room with supplied coffee, tea & hot cocoa, which is replenished daily. The bathroom is very very compact. However, there is an additional sink/mirror outside the bathroom so that two people can be getting ready at the same time. My most major complaint during our stay was that there was a noise coming out of a large vent in the room which hindered our sleep, even for my 10 year old. We had to muffle it with pillows but you could still hear it. We purposely did not turn on the air-conditioning for this reason but still had the constant noise. The hotel was packed to capacity so we were unable to change our rooms. Another negative was that when I made my reservations, they would not honor an internet special of 15% off reservations because they said they had reached their maximum number of special rates (even though that was not mentioned in the email or website). I then asked to use my AAA card & they would not honor that either for the same reason, which is really unfair. I have never had my AAA card declined for hotel reservations before for a hotel that typically accepts it. The pool area is nice but not as big as it looks. There were two days in which we walked around for ten minutes and could not find loungers. The loungers are placed so close together that you are practically on top of the person next to you. There is a sandy area of the pool which to me was a negative because when you enter the pool, it feels gritty on your feet from all the sand. There is a Beachclub outdoor eatery & although we normally like to eat poolside, the music there was blaringly loud & prevented us from doing so. The music was a bit loud in general in the pool area. I know it is the Hard Rock but some of us actually would like to relax quietly after a day at the parks. Another negative was that they allow smoking at certain sections near the pool, which I did not like. Sometimes we only found loungers in a smoking area & were stuck breathing in other people's smoke. On the plus side, the location to Universal cannot be beat & was the sole reason we stayed here. It is about a 5 minute walk to both parks & Citiwalk. Water taxis ran approx. every 8 - 10 minutes & were very convenient after all the walking at the parks. The ride & walk there is very scenic & beautiful. They do allow you early access to the parks for staying onsite HOWEVER the only thing open is the Wizarding World of Harry Potter from 8 am to 9am, before the park opens. However, to our dismay, we got up early to go to Harry Potter & arrived at 8:40 only to find non-hotel guests already being allowed into the park at that time. It was not even clear which line hotel guests were to enter, so even though we got to Harry Potter at 8:45, there were already a ton of non-hotel guests there & we ended up waiting 45 minutes just for Harry Potter. Not cool. There is a place on the first floor were you can buy snacks, ice cream, bagels & cereal food, however, it was expensive. A bagel was $3.50, which is outrageous. They have large water bottles for $4.50 and $6, again too expensive. Water at the parks was $2.75. We brought our own mini thermos & filled it with water & ice from the sink & icemaker. They do sell mini pints & half-pints of milk. We ate at the Kitchen restaurant, which was very good. Our favorite meals during our stay were at the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant, NBA City restaurant & Mythos at IOA, which I highly recommend for it's awesome interior atmosphere & food to match. They are usually open for lunch & on some evenings for dinner. I preferred them more for dinner but call ahead to see if they will even be open for dinner. All the restaurants/shops throughout Universal, IOA & City Walk honor AAA so be sure to use it!

We had never been, and I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so my husband humored me for this trip :) We had a blast! We booked a room at the Hard Rock specifically because of the off season deal prices, and the fact that your room key doubles as a fast pass for all the rides. This alone is worth staying on property, it saved us so much time and it was great being able to ride things as many times as we wanted. There are a couple of rides it doesn't apply to but we didn't have a problem anyway (although it WAS off season, as I said). When we checked in, we mentioned to the desk staff we were there for our anniversary and they upgraded us to a club level suite at no charge. This was completely unexpected and so appreciated! It totally made our stay. Being able to enjoy free breakfast, free snacks/water/soda, free alcohol at happy hour, and free dessert/snack every night was such a nice perk. Even if we didn't get this free, I would say it was worth the price for next time. The day of check out, our flight didn't leave until later in the evening, so we checked our bags. One of the perks of staying here is that anything you buy in the parks, you can have sent back to your room so you don't have to carry it around all day. As we were leaving our room, they brought us some bags of things that weren't ours. It ended up being a mix up with another guess miswriting their room number as ours, but as an apology for the \"inconvenience\", the staff gave us 2 free buffet breakfast vouchers for the Kitchen restaurant downstairs. Since we were checking out we asked if we could use them for lunch instead, and they couldn't do that. Instead, they offered us drink coupons for the restaurant or Beach Club. This was more than enough for us since it was such a minor inconvenience, so we got to enjoy a delicious lunch at the Kitchen, and then some free drinks. I read someone else's review that the mixed drinks are poured lightly and I have to disagree - ours were quite strong (and very good). Overall this was a wonderful stay for us.

It is perfect, however, to treat yourself and stay there for one night for the parks I can't imagine going to the parks and not staying at one of the onsite hotels. . Having that express pass, and the ability to walk back when you want is priceless. My kids got to go on rides 4 or 5 times each. You basically get 2 days for the price of one.

We liked that not only did the bathroom have a sink, there was also a sink outside the bathroom which made getting ready in the morning more convenient. It takes only 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to Universal Orlando and 10 minutes to walk to Islands of Adventure.

The pool is very large, and has a 260 foot winding water slide that is built into the landscaping. I especially loved that the pool is 4ft deep at its deepest point so that I didn't have to worry about my youngest daughter having difficulties playing in the pool. There were always at least 3 lifeguards on duty at all times. My only complaint about our stay was the loudness of the hallways at night.

The first night I did not sleep well at all, the other nights were a bit better ( I think exhaustion had a part in that!) A few tips that I would love to share from our trip are: 1. Eat at Mythos in Islands of Adventure - the food is great and the prices are comparable to the restaurants in City Walk. Our favorite items were the panini and bacon cheeseburger. 2. Harry Potter's Forbidden Journey ride made my son and I nauseous. It is a fantastic ride - I loved it, but I could not walk straight after getting off and felt a little ill all day. If you are prone to motion sickness - beware! I have heard that wearing a motion sickness patch that you can get from your doctor helps. 3.

I used the Do No Disturb sign the entire 1st day and received a phone message informing me that if I needed anything they are there, I just need to call. I used the luggage service, all of the transportation options to the park, and ate at the restaurants (The Kitchen & Emelios) and everyone was helpful and chipper, for lack of a better term.

Nice hotel, and the Fixx (the real band) was even playing in the lobby when we checked in which was very cool. It seems like all of the highpoints are touched on in other reviews, but from our perspective: The Good: Fun atmosphere. Close walk to Universal and City Walk, although given that our room was in the wing closest to City Walk it would have been nice to have exit/entrance doors on that side of the hotel so that we didn't have to walk back to the middle of the hotel coming and going. If the doors were there we couldn't find them. The Kitchen restaurant is one of the best hotel restaurants I've eaten in, and very kid friendly. Great food. The fast passes worked great in the park. And the free internet worked well. The bad: It's not a quiet hotel. I was awakened several times by voices in the hallway, in adjoining rooms and by nearby showers turning on. There is also an anti-Disney bias, which makes sense to some extent given that they're competition, except that it hurt the overall experience. Kids after long theme park days want to watch a little tv, but of course there are none of the Disney channels on the tv lineup. There's not even NickJr. So really disappointing viewing options for kids. Also, even though the concierge said that she gets Disney questions all the time, she said that she knows nothing about the Disney parks. Really? And you can't buy Disney park tickets at the hotel - \"everything but Disney\" was how they put it. Because really, who comes to Orlando to go to a Disney park? Also, although the band was great, it made it very difficult to check in. We had to shout back and forth with the girl at the front desk. And I may have missed something because I thought that she said that there was a 10% discount at Hard Rock Cafe with our room keys/charges. So we went there late our first night and had a mediocre meal only to learn that there was no discount, and worse, it took almost 10 minutes to pay using the room key card because although it is supposed to be a seamless charging option throughout the parks and at the cafe, apparently it is a complicated process. It would have been far faster just to use a credit card. The sleazy: when I quickly glanced over my bill at checkout, I noticed a $60+ charge for long distance to some foreign country. I had receipts showing that we were shopping/dining at Downtown Disney at the time, and they said that they would remove it from the bill. It may have been some random mistake, but more likely is that a hotel employee came into the room while we were out and made a long phone call. Not cool. I'd definitely stay here again given the location, but I'll check my bill carefully, I won't try to use the room card to charge anything, and I may move to a Disney hotel the days that I'm planning to go to Disney parks.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cIt's not just about the hotel, it's also about the parks\u201d", "Author": "crzzzr", "ReviewID": "UR123812652", "Content": "We decided to stay here because it was the mid-priced hotel within the park, because you got free fastpass access, and for convenience. We stayed for a week and got a great 7 night rate. We were hardly in our room there is so much to see and do. Riding rollercoasters at 7.30am was certainly a different way to wake up! If you are a Harry Potter fan, do yourself a favour and stay inside the park at the Hard Rock or one of the others, you will save yourself some serious queue time. Go straight to Harry Potter using your early park access - do the more popular rides then leave. Go back 1 hour before closing time and do a few more attractions there. Using the hotel supplied fastpass access - we waited only 10 mins for rides showing a 45 minute wait time - i can't imagine doing these busy parks any other way. We also bought a 6 park 14 day unlimited park ticket which was around $300 and well worth it as you can jump between parks whenever you want. This hotel has a Hertz rental car counter which was very handy - though their walk-up prices seemed quite high. So I recommend pre-booking if you need a car. Easy 7 min walk to the park from this hotel. No need to wait for the water taxi to the parks. Garden View rooms good enough in my view - you are hardly in your room anyhow :) Breakfast was around $20 plus service charge for a good buffet service. We ate at various other restaurants within the parks/universal city and had a great experience every time - the Hard Rock Cafe (restaurant, not hotel) meal was particularly good too. Another plus is that you can charge in-park purchases to your room and have them sent back there (the next day) so you don't have to carry them around with you. Guest laundry facilities were great and very useful to us as we were travelling for 6 weeks. Would definitely stay here again. Negatives: 1.

Inside there is a great lobby area and the place is extremely clean. The staff are all very courteous and a great many of them have quite unique looks (fans of 'hard rock' music I would guess), lots of spikey hair and cool jewellry (makes a change from the 'Disney-Look' you'll be seeing for a lot of your stay in Orlando no doubt). We stayed in a standard room but it felt like pure luxury. The rooms are spacious and have framed pictures of various rock legends on the walls which adds that cool touch. We didn't have much of a view because we had palm trees right outside the window, but who can complain about that? \"Ooh! This exotic plant of paradise is preventing me from seeing the pool!\" The bathrooms are also very spacious, very clean and to add to that extra bit of 'star treatment' you have some huge vanity mirrors over the sinks (the ones with all the lightbulbs around the glass). There's a few different restaurants (my favourite of which is called 'The Kitchen') and you can get a good variety of food. I can't remember though what the vegetarian selection was like, sorry. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all good here. There's a hot tub and swimming pool available to guests too. One of my favourite features included underwater speakers for the pool! It was quite a strange sensation to be floating along listening to a favourite tune and then dunking under the water and not having it interrupted at all, but it was awesome. Scattered around the hotel is various 'hard rock' memorabillia; if you're familiar with the Hard Rock franchise you'll know what I'm talking about. In cabinets all around the hotel you'll find famous outfits worn by rock legends, instruments and all sorts. I'm sure they probably rotate but while I was there I saw outfits and instruments that were previously owned by Elvis, Madonna, Jimi Hendrix, Kiss and many more. There is also a merchandise store if you'd like to take some cool, branded souveneirs home with you. The hotel is also situated right by 'City Walk', which is basically Universal's version of 'Downtown Disney', having lots of different shops and restaurants to spend your money at. It includes a Hard Rock Caf\u00c3\u00a9 if you're a big fan of the brand. At the end of City Walk is of course; the parks. Which means your hotel is roughly a five minute walk from the attractions. Nice! Lastly; staying at the hotel you get early access to the Universal theme parks which is awesome and your hotel key card also doubles as a fast pass for the rides which was just incredible. I almost felt guilty walking straight past all the general admission folk... almost. Because of this we got to do basically every ride at Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios.

I will do my review on our family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs/wants! We were a family of four with two daughters (14 and 18). We went knowing full well that this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a cheap choice, but we were celebrating several events! We wanted the added convenience of everything that the Hard Rock provides. The hotel is very beautiful and loved the layout. The people/staff were the best and always so helpful. Never ran into one rude worker! Loved the Velvet Lounge and enjoyed several nights at the bar. The bartenders were entertaining for sure! The open lounge area in the main entry level has free wi fi and it was nice to just hang out and read a book there too! We only went to the pool once but it is a wonderful pool area. The grill/bar by the pool is a great option to eat or just have drinks and watch a game. We also ate at The Kitchen which had a great breakfast buffet and dinner was also very good. I will also note that drinks and food here are not cheap! So know that before you go and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back complaining on TA about it!!! \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 If you are a drinker I would totally recommend stopping at a liquor store on the way\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.drinks and wine are like $10 each here!!!

There was afternoon snacks and drinks that was nice to have also. The evening hours d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122overs and drinks were a great addition and we took advantage of them too! Just to let you know the drinks were beer and wine only. The wine was just fine with me!! Again, stop on the way to the hotel for liquor!! The hours d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122overs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heavy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with items like meat balls, cheese, chicken wings, salad\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..it changed every day. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure some folks could make it their dinner if you wanted to!! Later at night they had desserts. We utilized them all and it was great to have with teens! There was always plenty of bottled water throughout the day and we always took several bottles to the room and then took 1 or 2 into the park. That is a savings in itself!! The room was nicely laid out with plenty of room for our family of four. There was a small chair/sitting area with a table and two chairs also. The bathroom was a great layout, especially with two teen girls!! The toilet/tub area could be closed with a door and it also had a sink area which I have never seen in a hotel. Then there was a larger sink and mirrored area that someone else could use while the shower/toilet area was utilized. Plenty of toiletries were provided also. Then there was a bar area with a locked frig with pay amenities and on top of it was a fabulous Keurig coffee maker. We LOVED having this and used it every morning. It also had tea and hot chocolate! The closet area had plenty of room with hangers and it also had a safe. We fit in an apple laptop and two iPads and they fit perfectly! There was also a dresser with six drawers in the room for clothes, etc. If you want to be in a quieter area of your floor, make sure you ask upon check in. We were next to some horribly noisy people! We called to change rooms and Hard Rock did it with no problems. They were so helpful and never questioned us!

The most attractive incentive for this hotel is that they offer a package that gives you an early admittance pass (1 hour earlier) to the parks and a \"skip to the front of the line\" card for the rides. The pool area is also amazing! The location makes having a car unnecessary, as you can walk or take a complimentary water taxi ride to the City Walk area, which is where the 2 parks have their main gates. Our room was rather spacious, though it had weird angles to it. For example, the wall on my side of the bed got increasingly wider as it went the length of the bed. (ie: think a triangular line) This made it difficult because the narrowest part was at the top and my head was faced right up against the wall. The bed was comfortable enough, however the pillow was the worst that I had ever used in my life. There were lumps throughout it and this made sleeping very uncomfortable. I did not find any replacement pillows in the closet. The sink area and the toilet/shower was separated. This was especially helpful because someone could be in the shower getting ready (it also had a small sink and mirror in it) while someone else could be preparing in front of the sink and mirror outside of the bathroom. (Great for family travel!) Two of my biggest complaints are as follows: 1. The walls were VERY thin. The second night we had neighbors that we could hear everything they were saying. Luckily they went out for a late night evening, so we were able to fall asleep. However, they returned after 2 AM and the noise started all over again. We were in a room that had an adjoining option. It was connected to that room, so maybe that was why the walls offered less sound proofing? 2. Although the room seemed clean, if you look close, you could see some neglected areas and that made me question how clean the rest of the room was. For example, when I looked around the mirror, there was dust all around it and behind it. It looked as if it hadn't been dusted in months. Nevertheless, the lobby area appeared spotless. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for family travel. (They also have a \"kids club\" option on site.) If you're looking to be right near the parks,are looking for a beautiful pool area, or want to be able to spend your time at City Walk, this is the place for you. A few years ago we stayed at the Portofino, which is close to the Hard Rock Hotel. The Hard Rock has a better location and is more family/kid friendly. However, I thought the Portofino was beautiful and had a romantic feel to it. So if it's just the two of you, consider looking into that hotel.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hastings", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "streakey", "ReviewID": "UR123359031", "Content": "we did not stay here but we visited it and had drinks there. it is a nice place to relax. the staff were very friendly.

Only downside is that it was about $12 a day for parking which is unusual for hotels in Orlando. Also the iconic memorabilia is all around the hotel. The room was big and had nice interior but the facilities could be improved as you had to pay for wifi unless you had a hard rock access card, also you had to pay to rent the use of the fridge to store you're own drink in. I don't think you could get a better location than this hotel if you want access to the Universal parks and City Walk, either a 10min walk or a free boat ride which arrives/departs every 20mins throughout the day from just outside the hotel and drops you off just outside the parks. There is also a service where people on bikes with a trailer for people to sit on will take you to the parks, it takes about 5mins and is good if the boat isn't there and you don't feel like walking. There is no charge but they earn off tips, I gave $6 each time. There are very good benefits staying here aswel as the location. With you're stay you get a free fast pass for the Universal parks. As we were there over christmas this was very helpful, both parks became full at one point and the queues for the major attractions were between 2-3 hours, with out fast pass we were only waiting 20mins max so they are definetely worth it. At the time they were charging $70 for a fast pass at the gates for people who didn't have one. You always get priority seating at the Hard Rock Restaurant. If you sign up to the 'all access' card you can get free internet access and 10% off at the hotel shop and Hard Rock Restaurant.

Lunch was an offering of bags of pretzels and cheetos and warm sodas. We had to ask for warm bottles of water if we wanted water because it was not readily available. The dining area was filthy with no one cleaning the floors or tables. Mashed food in the carpet, on the tables and chairs was standard. No nightly turn down service.

Locked out of our room until after 10pm again. When we asked the managers Eric Delvin and Al Patnik to compensate us in some way they refused then reluctantly took $17.00 off our room charge.

But boy, were we happy with it! We booked a complete package through Universal Parks & Resorts Vacations (UPRV), electing to stay on site in order to save the cost and hassle of a car, parking fees, and so on. A huge bonus is that the hotel room key serves as a \"free\" (if you can call it that!) Universal Express pass. Even if the parks aren't crowded, which they weren't for most of our visit, Universal Express saves a lot of walking: without it, you find yourself \"furbling\" through long walkways and queuing areas; Express generally takes a shortcut to the rides themselves. Service was fantastic, right from the start. We arrived mid-morning after an early flight to Orlando, excited but hungry. Front desk staff was great at orienting us to the hotel and its features-- and to our surprise, our room was ready early! We opted to drop our stuff off at our room only to find that engineering was just finishing up a paint touch-up. The bell captain, who made the trip to the room with us, apologized for the miscommunication and then had us follow him back to the Kitchen restaurant where they treated us to a wonderful buffet brunch for our \"inconvenience!\" The hotel has a park tickets desk and automated kiosk for picking up tickets that you've bought in advance. Free tickets are available for transportation to Wet 'n' Wild and Sea World (these buses only run once per day in each direction). Other ticket-related transactions (adding days or features) have to be done at the parks' own Guest Services windows. Everyone at the hotel had this very-refreshing \"service first\" attitude. It's what made me want to visit Orlando again in the first place-- the people here really understand hospitality. The entire hotel has typical Hard Rock theming-- you'll find rock memorabilia everywhere (a tour booklet at the front desk describes the hotel's entire collection), a great classic rock \"soundtrack\" throughout the common areas that makes it hard not to smile and tap your feet; yet never loud or obnoxious, just fun. The hotel itself is 650 rooms on 7 floors, with the Kitchen Restaurant, Emack & Bolios / Starbucks, and a nice workout room on the first, the lobby, Velvet Lounge, and Rock Shop on the second, guest rooms on 3-7 (where 7 is the \"Club Level\"). It's spread out in a large semicircle with the pool and Beach Club in the center. The heated pool was gorgeous, and really does have a working underwater sound system (though, once experienced, that's more of a novelty than anything else). Most of it is quite shallow-- 3.5 feet, with a small section of 4.5 feet. It has a fun waterslide at one end and plenty of seating around, including a \"sandy beach\" area. At night, the hotel hosts \"Dive-In Movies\"; you can watch a recent DVD release while you lounge in the pool! Beyond the pool (and surrounding one side of the hotel) is a pathway that's a short walk to Universal Studios; a bridge connects that to CityWalk, and another bridge joins the far end of CityWalk with Islands of Adventure. If you spend all day at (particularly) IOA, your feet will appreciate the water taxi service that runs between CityWalk and the hotel every 15 minutes. It's a great scenic ride day or night. The rooms themselves are fairly typical in size and amenities. No fridge or microwave, but very clean, nice dressing area outside the bathroom, very clean and neat. And what a view! Our room faced both the pool and the parks-- a great sunset sight, with the parks all lit up and the colored lights on Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit reminding you of just where you are! The only real issue I found with the room itself was that the bathroom is sized, and the door located, such that you have to stand in about a 6\" diameter circle-- between the sink and toilet-- in order to open or close the door without hitting your toes. The Kitchen restaurant is fantastic-- best buffet breakfast we've ever had anywhere. Huge selection, friendly staff, great food. The real only downside is the price. When you visit a theme park, you expect to be treated like the captive audience you are: $9.00 hamburgers, $2.75 beverages, and so on. Staying in an on-site hotel extends that experience, depriving you of even a temporary escape back to the world of normal prices; That breakfast buffet at the Kitchen is $20/person, which is a lot even for a resort, and there's no real options other than feeding your family some kind of packaged food you brought with you. My only other pricing gripe: At Hard Rock's prices, Wi-Fi internet should be free. It's not-- it's $9.95 per day per device.

Now for the good points, staying in one of the 3 hotels on sight gives you an automatic express pass for all the rides, this in itself is worth staying there, also the breakfast in The Kitchen is excellent, a buffet style with a hugh choice for 10usd for kids and 19.99 for adults, the staff are very friendly and the Valet parking is a must, this is an extra 7usd per day over the standard parking charge of 15 per night, when ever you want your car you just text them and it's waiting for you outside within 5 minutes, then when you come back just drive up to reception and they take it off you.

Expensive when most rest of Orlando is in cut price economy, so price needs to be in the budget, otherwise the experience will be tarnished by value comparison. We, family 4, x2 adults x2 children teens, stayed in a two bed queen room, Club level.. Three nights was 2000 dollars , ouch. Concierge was great but not luxurious. Breakfast, all day drinks, evening drinks, nibbles, late dessert and milk and cookies, Fantastic and we certainly got value in our upgraded price. Room was well laid out and the kids loved it , even though we had left an amazing cruise and then some nights at Disney Vacation Club with room to live, let alone holiday. Good amenity and exceptional room service... really good portions , heat and service. Why did we go , when we are Disney members? HARRY POTTER. Yes we were there peak 28th December and headed to the park at 6.30am... Got a rickshaw lift , all four of us, for a tip and were in the park by 7.00am and already in the LINE,,,,, OMG talk busy and double it. They closed the park by mid morning and all who had got in got given a ticket time to return until even that ran out and park closed by midday.They then let people in only as people left. We would have paid even more than our price at Hard Rock to get that early advantage at peak time, after seeing such dismay and disapointment in the hundreds of fans unable to get in on the days they were there. Harry Potter is amazing and goose bumpy exciting even for us adults and a lasting memory for the children. We had left that Harry' area by 10am and by then it was nose to back busy, with a two hour wait at broomsticks and leander wand shop. Definately choose the Hard Rock, just even check out the ladies toilet for a flash into the Rock and Roll era, memorabiliar, relaxed atmosphere. Here you can wear your branded jeans and casual stuff and feel the part, instead of feeling underdressed in a swanky place , you feel sooooo relaxed it is great for teens and groups. We would stay again if we were again forced into peak holiday times at Universal and the currently high focus Harry Potter. If not taking advantage of park perks...?? There is better value for your dollar,much better, but we were sold on the whole theme and had a blast. Met some great like mind families and couples in the club lounge, whilst we downed quite a few champagne and red wine drinks to go with the Hor deuves.

The pool area was lovely, although unfortunately we did not have time to use it! There is a secure car park (which unfortunately, is chargeable- works out at about $16 a day, or $30 valet.) I have visited florida 12 times and never had to pay for car parking at the accomodation. You can use either a walkway to get to Citywalk/Islands of adventure/Universal- which takes about 5-10 mins, take the free water taxi (approx. every 20 mins.) There are also people on bikes (with trailors) that can be used, for a tip to the driver. The only bad points were the car park charges ($16 a day), internet charges ($10 a day) and we used the hotel phone for 9 mins which cost over $70 + tax. before visiting, it is worth signing up for the hard rock 'All Access' Card- which gives you 10% off in the shop, restaurant, and they will also upgrade your room when possible.

The Harry Potter ride unfortunately does not utilize the express pass.... but the Harry Potter area and the ride opened at 7am just for on-site guests, so even for the most popular ride, without an express pass, we only waited for 30 minutes to ride. Staying on-site is expensive, but in return you get to skip lines and waits. The hotel was lovely-- delicious food, welcoming staff, great housekeeping, cool rock and roll memorabilia everywhere.

The main reason we decided to stay was for the front of the line pass for both parks, and that right there was worth the price. There were many times where a line might be 20-30 minutes and we would walk right up go on the ride and then after it was done go back on the same ride and walk right up again. The only negative is that the front of the line pass could not be used for Forbidden Journey ride or rip rock it rollercoaster which are both amazing rides.

The rooms themselves are just average. Clean and plenty of room. It would be nice to have the use of the refridgerator without having to pay extra. We had a garden view and it was very quiet. We thought the beds were comfortable. The people that worked there were really outstanding. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We definately appreciated the service. The pool area is very nice. The grounds are well maintained. Of course, you can't beat the location. It was great to be able to walk to the parks, or take the ferry. The only downside for us was the price of the Kitchen and Emack and Bolios. We ate breakfast at the buffet at the Kitchen one morning, and while it was good I don't think it was worth the price. We got pizza from Emack's and that was just bad. We don't mind paying high price for good quality, but do mind if the product is just average or below. The atmosphere there was nice. I liked seeing the Rock'N'Roll paraphenelia, and the music was nice...not too loud.

Although I tend to stay at more budget minded hotels, I do like to splurge now and then. The hotel is not cheap by any means, but includes some nice perks which make up for the cost. As soon as you enter, you feel like a rockstar. The hotel is jam packed with Rock and Roll memoriabelia everywhere you look. Just wandering around the hotel can be an exerience in itself. If you can find some time to relax, they have a rather large pool with slide and underwater speakers which is quite unique. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. For those of you that are \"green\" make sure to look in the display rack on the table (at least that was where mine was) for a plastic bag to recycle your newspaper, cans or bottles. This is something that I have never seen in a hotel before. And now onto the perks. On-site hotel guests get early admission to Islands of Adventure and the Wizzarding World of Harry Potter! Be sure to take full advantage of this as the area is quite popular and can be crowded at times. Once inside Potter be sure to experience Olivanders Wand Shop first. This is a brief 4-5 minute show, but only 25-30 people are allowed in at a time so the wait times can be brutal. In addition to early admission to IOA, your hotel key serves as a fast pass on most of the attractions at BOTH parks. Unfortunately The Forbidden Journey Ride is not included as one of those rides, so be sure and do it before the parks open to all other visitors. Depending on the day, a fast pass can be quite expensive at Universal. Of the three hotels, Hard Rock is the closest to both parks. You can take a leisurely walk, complimentary water taxi, or even a pedicab (for the price of a tip) to the parks. If the Hard Rock is not available, all of the resorts are nice and similarly priced. The rooms at Hard Rock are similar in size to that of the Royal Pacific, and a bit smaller than those at the Portofino, but still quite comfortable. As with most high end hotel there is a $15 per night charge for parking and a charge for internet access. It would be nice to include at least the internet at these rates. The Fitness Center looked quite extensive and there is a charge for it unless you are a \"Club Level\" guest. If you happen to be at the resort on the last Thursday of the month, be sure to check out \"Velvet Sessions\" which is a rock and roll cocktail party held in an intamate setting. There is a cost for this, however it is cheaper to book in advance. According to their website past performers have included Bret Michaels, Eddie Money, Joan Jett, Journey and many others.

Check in was great the front desk person was warm and helpful; however once they have swiped your credit card it is downhill from there. Here are some things you should be aware of; Hard Rock Orlando will book a standard room for a party of five no problem, when you arrive and check in you realize you only have sleeping arrangements for 4 two queen size beds. When you speak to the front desk they will tell you no problem and provide you a roll away bed for an additional $25.00 a day, this could be me however I feel cheated if they book a standard room for 5 people then they should tell you up front that it will only sleep 4 and a $25.00 a day roll away bed charge will be added to your bill. The standard rooms are small and when you add the roll away bed you are packaged like sardines. When you find prehistoric size cock roaches in your room they will send someone to your room to investigate, however the young lady they sent to ours was so frighten that my son had to end up smashing the bug, while she washed the wall down to remove the evidence. You will then have to wait another day to be moved to what you can only hope is a clean(er) room which takes will into late afternoon so your night is spent looking around the room in horror your day is spent shaking out and packing your belongings and your afternoon is spent waiting to be moved to a different room. During the move my grandson left his Nintendo DXL in the dirty room when I realized this I call the front desk, which transferred me to security who check lost and found then told me nothing had been turned in. I went down to the concierge to explain what had happen this women listen carefully showing no emotion and told me there was nothing they could do. The fact is the security person was more helpful and took it upon herself to walk through housekeeping and check each cleaning cart for my grandsons Nintendo, she arrived at our door late in the evening to return the item, two thumbs up for security perhaps Hard Rock you could have them train your Concierge Staff? The one good thing I can state is look for a Vibe Manager; if you are lucky enough to find one then you will be treated with respect and feel as if someone at Hard Rock really cares about your time spent on their property. My angel of mercy was a Vibe Manager named Steven King; he listen expressed outrage made phone calls and apologized for everyone less the caring attitude. He stated that my Nov 23, stay (one day) amount would be removed from my bill as an act of good faith provided me his care and told me to contact him if I had any further problem. Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus. Unfortunately when I checked out the charge for Nov 23 was still on my bill and when I told them it was to be removed nothing happen the bill remained the same, just like the song. There are lots of nice things at Hard Rock the Beach area, the Velvet Lounge, Restaurants and grounds for exercising and having fun, however if Hard Rock want to maintain a standard of being a Deluxe Hotel and charge upwards of $287.00 a night to stay on their property they have a long way to go in the customer satisfaction area.

If you hate waiting in lines- you get an express pass. If you want to make sure you get done all there is to do at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter- you get into the park an hour early. If you got wet from the rain and need to change or just want to be as close to the park as possible- you get walking distance from the parks- literally only a few minutes away, and mind you, you do get distracted looking at all the shops and food passing through CityWalk. We chose a 2 Queen bed with pull out sofa to fit the 5 of us. The room was spacious for us. If you need a pull out, make sure the description says so, otherwise you could get a 2 queen bed that could fit 5- but only if you pay extra for a cot. If you like fresh coffee, you'll love having the Keurig K-cups there, part of the room. Our room seemed spotless, until I looked up and saw webs of dust hanging from the ceiling corners. There is a pool which has this cool sand beach side to it. Although the pool was not our main purpose to visit, it was nice to take a dip. Keep in mind that the pool has no deep end and the jacuzzi area is quite small- there is an \"Adult only\" sign there, but we happened to be share this tiny hot waterhole with \"adults\" who just turned 21, and they were very disturbingly drunk. The culture of the hotel is rock, and so the staff have a laid back, friendly service. Keep in mind that visitors who are of a much older generation or those unfamiliar with rock culture may not see responses like, \"Awesome\" and \"Hey, what's up\" as friendly or respectful. The staff is very knowledgable, and every staff person we met was eager to meet our needs and help. As of this date, there is $15 parking fee/per day for self parking, or you could pay for valet service.

We got off to a good start -- valet staff and Claudia at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The lobby is just beautiful too! We loved our deluxe room, it was huge and full of nice amenities. We decided to upgrade to a Club Room and it was definitely worth it. Breakfast was great, and my kids loved the afternoon snack time. For \"happy hour\" there were a couple nights there was so much good food we didn't even need dinner afterwards -- and we're vegetarians, so this was a surprise to us that they would offer so much. Staff in Club Lounge was also great. One nite my son wasn't feeling weel and concierge here brought crackers and ginger ale up to our room -- her idea, not mine. Only complaint: If you are a guest and come in to gorge yourself on desserts then pile a plate as high as Mt. Everst to take more back to your room, please at least put on a shirt. Seriously, there was one particularly fat man who ignored the \"shirts required\" sign AND turned the already loud music in the lounge up so high you couldn't talk. Grow up \"dude,\" you look like a 60 yr old idiot. This was particularly annoying at breakfast when you are just waking up. The hotel should consider making volume controls inaccessible to guests and enforcing the shirts required rule. Moving on, pool area was beautiful, fun and great place to hang out. We had dinner at The Kitchen, staff was great and the night we went they had magicians who were quite entertaining. One note -- service at poolside cafe was horrendous for food, but Ok for drinks. The night we ate there we waited so long for the bill, my husband and daughter had time to go up to the room, change into bathing suits and start swimming while I sat in a sea of dirty plates waiting for the check.

Drinks all day (softs) is also great and the staff always help us out with milk whenever we asks for it. Could do with changing the options at the evening session and include more veg friendly things. That said, I'm content with the beer! I felt this year the rooms could benefit from some sprucing up and I did find toenail clippings near the window, so vacuuming on that occasion could have been better. Our fridge was also gross with mould on the products and in the trays. Someone had burst a liqueur and it had never been cleaned properly. After about 4-5 attempts at complaining they replaced the fridge. We got a free breakfast for the trouble and $100 off the bill. Site and pool are fantastic and clean, restaurants are amazing (my hair and appearance are a bit to wild to have me venture to the Palm but I love the Kitchen - try the seared ahi tuna!!!!). Drink is expensive for sure but usually includes the tip, you're on holiday!! Our oldest is 11 now and we have no problem sending him to the pool on his own. It's well staffed and we're very confident in the pool staff to let him go on his own. Other reviewers speak of the room keys and fast pass. Invaluable with kids, without a doubt. We don't even bother with Disney anymore because of the perk. The main thing that let this trip down was they swiped our credit card at check in for the entire stay amount which cleaned us out. We didn't realise til we tried to hire a car and the card kept bouncing. We were furious with that. Car aside, had there been a medical matter, as we have had previously, we'd have been screwed. We never got our car (but testement to the staff, 2 we've become friends with over the years actually took us out fishing and nature spotting on their day off - that's the special part about the hotel), but we did get a refund of a few days (on top of the fridge issue) as an apology and assurance that we will be extra special taken care of next visit. Few complaints in here, but they do address them and given the years we've been going thats our first grumbles. Everyone makes mistakes and as long as its sorted quickly and to our satisfaction we're happy campers. We love it period. We're FL tourist vets since '96.

We had been to Disney several times but Universal only once when my son was 2 (he didn't remember it). 3. We picked a Universal Hotel because of the early access to Harry Potter. They let hotel guests into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter 1 hour early, which is key to getting in and out quickly. Another beneifts was the front of the line pass which can be used multiple times. 4. We picked the Hard Rock Hotel over Portofino Bay and the Pacific Resort because it was the closest park to the Universal theme parks. My son age 11 and daughter age 8 wanted to stay in the hotel which was cool. 5. The pool looked awesome - had a 250+ foot circulat water slide. Also underwater music piped in. On arrival these is a beautiful circular driveway with a dropoff. Checkin was quick. They give you room cards for each member of the room. These cards also serve as your early entry ticket if you want to go 1 hour before the Wizarding World of Harry Potter opens. The lobby is impressive and truly rock star. We brought our suitcases up to our room. The room had 2 large queen beds. There was a parking lot at the side of the hotel which cost 12 dollars per day which you accessed with your room card. The room itself had 2 queen beds, a tub, toilet and small sink in the bathroom, and a large sink/vanity outside the bathroom. There is a Keurig coffee maker and my daughter ended up making multiple drinks every day - coffee, tea and hot cocoa. She loved that machine. They don't have a refrigerator or microwave in the room - I think there is a 10 or fifteen dollar extra charge, but it wasn't worth it for us as we didn't really need these features. The walking path to the theme parks comes out right next to the Universal Studios Entrance. The hotel is closer than the parking garage is to the theme parks. There is an official walking path from the pool area (which is only open when the pool is open, 8 AM to 11 PM, so that's not helpful if you want to get the Harry Potter before 8). It is beautifully landscaped but winding and less direct than the route we took. (see below) We didn't bother taking the boat becuase I had read it took longer than walking. There is an unofficial route that I read about on line - just exit the hotel through the main entrance, take a left past the palm restaurant, down the stairs and walk in the parking lot along the side of the hotel. This took about 5 minutes. The pool itself was a lot of fun. The kids went down the slide multiple times. We went in the first day of our trip but then the weather cooled down. We ate at the Palm restaurant for dinner one night - good food but overpriced. The kids and their dad had the breakfast buffet in the kitchen which was excellent (my husband said it was better than the Palm). The kids meals were only 5 dollars each though the adult was 20 dollars. I saw Homer Simpson in the elevator - they have character dining on Saturday night. Service is top notch. We usually stay in reasonably priced hotels and I was blown away by the service. 1. One of the light bulbs had blow out in a lamp. I called guest services and within 5 minutes they had brought up another. 2. We requested more pillows and another comforter. They brought this up within 30 minutes. 3. The theme park will deliver your purchases to your guest room by the next day. The first day we bought 2 bags of souvenirs which made it our room by the next day. Another day we bouth 2 bags of souvenirs - but only one make it to our room. We called guest services, we had a copy of the receipt, they checked their records and showed that it had been delivered to our room. It was a superhero t shirt for my son which was 20 dollars. We couldn't find it. It was a small bag and I suspect it had been delivered to another room by accident. It was 5:30 when we got back to the room and found just one souvenir bag instead of two. We were leaving the next day. We called the front desk, and The Universal staff sent someone over to get a new shirt and delivered it to our room later that evening. My husband and I were blown away. They could have handled it sevearl different ways. It truly is STAR service. The only mar about our hotel experience, which was not under the control of the hotel at all, was that on sat night at 12:30 AM we were awakened by an unruly man who was cursing and yelling in the hallways. After what seemed like an eternity because he kept yelling (but was probably more like 15 minutes), first hotel security surrounded him and then the Orlando police came and took him away. The kids slept though it all. I doubt he was a hotel guest. We loved the Hard Rock and would stay there again in a heartbeat.

What a great experience. I was overdue for a vacation, so I'm sure that made it better. Was traveling with myself, 40+, my daughter, later twenties and my 12 year old nephew for his birthday trip. This property completely made every one of us happy. I have never stayed at a Hard Rock Hotel prior to this and was pleasantly surprised. I am used to nice hotels, but the vibe and atmosphere here was great. It has made me want to seek out other Hard Rock Hotels to stay at. My nephew is just learning to play guitar, so he was thrilled to run around and look at all of the memorabilia. We used the early entry into Universal, so that was so worth staying at the Hard Rock. We got to do Harry Potter a few times quickly before the crowds set in. After long days at the parks, my very hyper nephew was still ready to go. We all went down to the pool area. He instantly made friends. So, I was able to relax in the lawn chair at the beach area, while he hung out with his new friends in the pool. We had snacks and drinks delivered from the lovely and friendly pool area staff. Felt very safe about the hotel and area. So, we were able to let him run downstairs to Emack and Bolio's to get a snack, etc. and feel totally comfortable. Rooms were large and comfortable. It rained hard for almost a whole day when we were there, so came back from SeaWorld early and rented movies in the room and still enjoyed ourselves. Our only negative at all was that we got pizza at Emack and Bolios on the rainy day and it took a really long time and was just not good. We had lots left over and that's not the norm for us.

There are so many reasons but let's start with convenience and safety. The beautiful green paths that connect the Hard Rock with Universal are safe, gorgeous and fun and we let our kids (13 & 14 yrs old) go by themselves from the hotel to the park without worry. The early admission (one hour before the park opens to everyone else) is incredible and we stayed in bed as our kids ventured to the park at the crack of dawn. (You do need to go with them the first day to register their ticket and fingerprint - a very quick process.....under a minute). The Speed Pass that you get from the hotel also is a great feature that saves about 30 to 40 minutes for each ride. The combination of Hard Rock Hotel and Harry Potter Village was just perfect. Now for the hotel: Clean, fun and relaxing. The lobby is huge and is perfect for meeting up with other families or just people-watching. The pool is the hub of activity with a great bar and family friendly restaurant (not to mention the wonderful \"Kitchen Restaurant\" that is just steps away). We had actually started this vacation a bit disappointed when we were told that our room was not ready for regular 4 p.m. check in but I have to mention that the front desk attendant, Claudia, was incredibly nice about it and she turned the issue into a positive. Claudia gave us drink passes and suggested that we try the bar by the pool - my wife and I had Margarittas while the kids enjoyed Pink Lemonaides. Within a few minutes Claudia called my cell phone and told us the room was ready, We then loved having a \"friend\" at the front desk that we would stop and say hello to each time we passed - it was as if our happiness had become her personal mission (if you have ever heard the term \"Nordstrom Sevice\", that is how we felt). There were more great people working at the Hard Rock: Robert a lightly bearded waiter at the pool would make us laugh with his good natured comments, and Sara at the Pool Restaurant was incrddibly attentive. That's why this hotel and vacation were so great.... beautiful grounds, friendly staff, immaculate rooms - and a brand new multimillion dollar Harry Potter Village next door at Universal Studios (complete with Butter Beer and Pumpkin Juice).

Beds are soooo comfortable. Room sleeps 5. However, 5 is a little tight. This time I had three in my room. It was very comfortable. We stayed on club level, which I highly recommend. You get continental breakfast. We went in at 7, finished breakfast. Then headed to the parks. Continental breakfast was bagels, danish, cereal, hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt. Very nice. They had the club room open all day for drinks, and chips(etc). Great for the kids. From 5 - 7 was beer, wine, and great snacks like chicken wings, nachos, cheese/crackers, etc. Then again at night, cookies and milk. Definately worth the extra $. Sometimes we didnt even go out for dinner. The pool is beautiful. Staff is friendly. Loved Ginger, a server at the pool . Kids loved the water slide, and movies by the pool. The best part is the Express passes. Everyone gets one included in your room. So that means no wait for the rides. Get to the park early, and go on all the rides, no lines. Then you still get to enjoy the pool. You can buy the express passes at the park, and they cost you a fortune. They are included in your room cost, how great is that. I have also stayed a Royal Pacific, its nice. But its not the Hard Rock. Hard Rock is a smaller hotel, which I like. Its also a closer walk to the parks. You can also take the watertaxi.

Water taxis to and from CityWalk are fantastic after a long day of walking around and the usage of room keys as express passes was really handy, even in early October when the regular lines weren't nearly as long as they are in the summer. Early entrance into the Harry Potter area was nice as well though we only took advantage of that once. If we'd had impatient kids I definitely would have gone in early again :) The room itself was decent. Two fairly comfortable queen beds with feather pillows and a nice view of the water taxi canal. The first room they put us in was still dirty, with crumbs on the floor and an unidentified sticky substance on the table, but the front desk was more than happy to switch rooms and made sure we got a better view. The bathroom was weirdly shaped, it was a bit of a challenge to get in and shut the door before using the toilet due to the angle of the door. Shower had a non-slip surface and a nice showerhead. There's a sink in the bathroom, and a nice vanity with makeup mirror outside the bathroom. The pool was really nice, but only 4 feet at its deepest. There is an adults-only hot tub hidden in the back which is actually larger than the one in which kids are allowed. There are constantly servers from the Beach Club wandering around if you want something to drink. There are speakers underwater so you can hear the music while swimming. Neither of us used the waterslide but judging by the number of kids we saw making repeat trips, it must be fun. We made use of the self service laundry room - there is one on the second floor and one on the fourth. Be aware that it is $2.75 per load (that is, $2.75 to wash, another $2.75 to dry), and we had to run our clothing through the dry cycle twice to get it dry. There is a change machine in each laundry room if you run out of quarters. The theming of the hotel was nice. There is a lot of random music memorabilia around, everything from Elvis's jumpsuit to stuff worn by N'Sync and Tears for Fears. There are photos of famous musicians in all the rooms and a TV channel devoted to playing music videos all day. Our one complaint is that the door locks seem to have issues - our keys would randomly stop working (not just for the room - also the self-parking card slot, and the one at the pool entrance, and by the water taxis). One day the door lock on our room ceased to function, meaning that our room was unlocked all day. We returned late that night and the front desk sent maintenance up to fix it, but no compensation was offered - I felt that they could have at least offered us free breakfast or something, especially since it took the guy 30 minutes to fix the door. Luckily we had made use of the in-room safe to store valuables but it was still really disconcerting.

The website to purchase was easy, and did go over amenities for the hotel. Now, my pet peeve for \"full service\" hotels is as follows: Why can't you ever have a refrigerator and microwave in the room. This would be so nice when you go our to dinner and have a doggy bag, you can keep it refrigerated and then heat it up in the middle of the night. The Hard Rock also goes after the cash with parking per day, with valet parking extra. Amenties in the room are a pretty neat single cup coffee, tea and hot chocolate maker, but the evian in the room is apparently very precious to somone. Room: We had a standard two queen room, the beds are comfortable, they have a comforter on them as well. No bedspread which is good. Pillows have two with textured covers that aren't really comfortable to sleep on. TV is a flat screen with no lag in remote use, and they have standard channels including HBO. One nice thing is they have a all music video channel, and three channels devoted to Universal Studios. Room has a chair with cassock too. Small table, and a Rolling Stones magazine. Bathroom is standard bath, don't try to open the door if anyone is on the toilet. They won't have knees when you are done. Small sink in actual bath, with a larger vanity on outside. Very nice makeup mirror. Also they have the retractable string to hang clothes on. They do have a turndown service, but you have to request it and we didn't. Pool is a large shallow pool, one side has a waterslide that you can get some speed on. There is also an adult only hot tub hidden on the back side. There are multiple fountains for kids to play in too. They do have a ping pong table and hula hoops by the pool as well. On of the biggest advantages to staying on site is getting into Harry Potter 1 hour before everyone else and having the express pass to get onto rides quickly. Remember, get to hogwarts castle on the early express plan because any other time they do not have express passes on that ride. We did feel bad, briefly, about passing everyone else in line, but it makes for a less stressful day. The water taxi is free to the parks, and runs about every 15 minutes. We didn't feel like we had to wait an extended time to get the boat, and it is a blast to watch them sling that back end around. (For those interested, it is a YANMAR 360 degree drive on a propane powered 40hp) There are multiple restauraunts at the hotel, we only went to the ice cream place for breakfast (basic donuts, but they do make donuts as big as your head.) Other times we ate at the Citiwalk. Hotel music artifacts were somewhat weird. Elvis's jumpsuit seems to be the highlight, and a few guitars by some good acts and some class B acts. Staff was very friendly and helpful, one of our party (Dorkfish #1) left her cell phone somewhere and it was turned in by staff after we left. They are going to ship it to her for free. The grounds are really nice, lots of trails to walk through, they also have an Arcade as well. I never used the bar, but the menu was reasonable. Not only is your room key your express pass, it can also be used as your credit card. Lock up your stuff in the room safe and only take that to US and Island. Consider getting a lanyard with the plastic sheath so you don't have to dig it out every time. Anything bought at the park can be delivered, but delivery does not occur until 9am the next morning. Final evaluation: If you are going to Universal, it is well worth it to stay at one of the onsite hotels. Hard Rock is a great choice, especially if you have teenagers. It is the closest from that end as well. Staff is very friendly. With the amenities, prices are reasonable, but extras are expensive. We will go back the next time we go to Universal.

When you check in early, your Express Access is available from check in until the end of the day of the check out, so therefore if you just stay for 1 night, you have Express Access for 2 days. We found that with Express Access 6 hours per day for Universal Studios and Island of Adventure is enough to get through nearly all the rides. Express Access is really the reason why the rooms at Hard Rock are so much more expensive than nearby off resort hotel, but for just one night, I think it is worth the cost. The room is basic with some rock memorabilia. The furniture is a bit old, but the bed is comfortable. We tried both room service and The Kitchen. I really recommend The Kitchen for lunch as the food is nicely prepared and light on the stomach for a reasonable price.

The hotel feels different from the Florida pack as soon as you walk in, with attractive young staff dressed in black and music being played. Booked a \"garden view\" room and was disappointed to be shown to a room with a view of the entrance / car park. However, when i expressed my disappointment, this was quickly dealt with and we were moved to a pool view room, from where you could also see Universal studios. As other reviews have mentioned, there is a bit of music noise from the pool, so ask for one at the back if that matters to you. Rooms are a nice size and very clean, with a pod coffee machine. Bathroom is usual set-up, with an additional sink / vanity area outside. Theme parks are a short walk away or you can take the boat for a pleasant start to the day. Both only take a few minutes. Room keys double as queue jump passes which means you don't spend a lot of time hanging around in the heat - bliss. They also get you early (8am) entry to Harry Potter which is where the crowds head at 9am so well worth it. We were able to take photos without hundreds of other people in them and walk straight onto the main ride twice. Breakfasts in the Kitchen were pretty good - around $60 for 2 adults and 1 child. Kids are only $5 if you get there early enough (we didn't!). Dinner was definitely American portions! I found the starter quesadillas too much for a main course. Opted for a delicious seared tuna with sesame rice cake starter the next night which was perfect. There was a magician there the first night and Shrek & Scooby Doo characters the next night.

You will know that at the Hard Rock nothing is free. A fridge is $15 a day and you pay for wifi (except in the lobby) and the gym (i got a 4 day pass for $26). Breakfast in the Kitchen is also pretty steep, $20 per person for a buffet style or you can order individual things off the menu. This is however false economy as a portion of scrambled eggs and bacon will run you $10-15 and even portions of fruit are $5-10! You could go to the on site shop which sells ice cream as well as cereal and croissants. two croissants and a bottle of orange juice ran me $10. Also if you need a taxi may I recommend going to city walk and getting a mears taxi. If you go to the front door of the hotel there are cabs from a company called ODC (on demand chauffeur). Be warned, these guys will rip you off. I wanted to go to the premium outlet (about a mile and a half away), the driver drove up one side of I Drive and down the other and charged me $25 for the pleasure. A mears taxi a week later, $10. One day whilst in a hurry I reluctantly got a cab from the front door to go a mile up the road to get a bus to the space centre. Again the driver went every which way and charged me $20 for a journey that should have been a mile but he made into several! The hotel itself is very nice, my room on the 2nd floor had a pool view. Nice room but unfortunately at 8am every morning the rock music starts up in the pool area so if you want a lie in invest in ear plugs! The room also had two double beds, a small bathroom area, a coffe maker and a tv with about 50 channels. On my floor there was also an ice machine and laundry facilities. The hotel is also very handy to the Universal parks which are about a 5-10 minute walk away or if it's too hot take the free water taxi. There are also guys from the rickshaw company who linger near the water taxi stop. As other posters have said, the walls seem to be paper thin, if you're a light sleeper I recommend ear plugs not only for the 8am rock fest but for party goers marching up and down the halls until all hours.

Pros: Very fast check in, cool rock memorabilia, comfy bed, luxurious linen and towels, magnifying mirror and full length mirror, decor in room was cool and contemporary.

I would have been happy with a Mears cab but felt that my choice wasn't listened to as 'Rockstars' travel in style i guess and a metered cab would not suffice. Later on my holiday i took a Mears cab and the driver told me that the Hard Rock no longer call metered cabs and now has a contract with a private car company.

The size of the room was as expected (reasonable for 2 doubles).

There's always music being played with plenty of live performances, including in the lobby and around the pool. The kids loved it, especially different music underwater from that above. We had read that room cleaning sometimes is not up to standard so that remained a little concern and on one day we returned from Universal at around 4pm to find that the room was not cleaned.

Guest services were also very happy to bring us extra hot chocolate/tea/coffee. We only ate breakfast in the hotel which was excellent (and free!).

One afternoon we even heard live music. One complaint I had was that you could hear a lot of noise from the hallways in the room. Given the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme, it attracts lots of teens and young adults, so they could hardly be blamed for rolling back to their rooms in the late hours of the night, but it would have been nice to have more soundproofing for the younger and older rockers trying to get some sleep. You have several options for transportation to the parks. You can take a water taxi to the City Walk area, you can walk on a lovely path (about a quarter mile, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing) or you can take a bicycle taxi. All three options are relaxing and efficient. If you are accustomed to Disney, the Universal resorts and parks are much more compact and easy to navigate. We ate one meal at the Kitchen. While it was good, the portions were much too huge, and because the hotel rooms don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have refrigerators, we had to let that go to waste. You also have many excellent dining choices at City Walk, which we frequented at least daily. In sum, it was a great stay and we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to stay here again.

The hotel met, but did not exceed expectations, and on the whole it is fair to say that the reviews on trip advisor (if the most extreme ones are ignored) are very accurate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll comment first, on the positives. If you want to visit either Islands of Adventure or Universal Studios, these are seriously good positives... The main reason we chose the hotel was the proximity to these parks and the fast passes. As expected these proved to be completely invaluable, saving literally hours of queuing time, allowing multiple turns on the major attractions. It was brilliant being able to walk to the parks (and be able to come back for a change of clothes after having been totally soaked on a water ride). Hard Rock is the closest of the three hotels and a really easy stroll, mainly in the shade. The hotel's Starbucks opened at 6.15am so it was possible to take advantage of the early access to Harry Potter with some food/coffee inside. The early HP access is also a serious benefit given the popularity of the attraction but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t underestimate the early start required for the 7am entry given your days in Orlando tend to be very busy. However, perfect for British travellers for a couple of days whilst bodies adjust to the time difference. If you stay at the hotel please take the time to look around at all the memorabilia; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s everywhere and really fascinating. We only ate twice at the hotel (breakfast mentioned later in the review) and an evening meal on our last night at the Kitchen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we received superb service, great food choice and excellent food. The not so good stuff: Check In: Despite a four hour delay on our flight from the UK and arriving at the hotel at 11pm it still took nearly 30 minutes to check in which was crazy. In the end the delay appeared to have been around upgrading us to a pool view room (which, in reality, we didn't really want as these rooms were definitely noisier). However, frankly I was too tired to make a fuss and the receptionist threw in a complimentary breakfast at the Kitchen for the wait (and this breakfast turned out to be exceptionally good). Room: Our room was clean, the beds big and comfy but the bathroom was very small for a family of four and the shower water power very ordinary. We never had an issue with the timing of the housekeeping; perhaps that was because we tended to be out most of the day but we did take the time to be friendly to the housekeeping staff. Pool: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say the pool area was ok but very busy, too many (uncomfortable) sunbeds and the water really isn't very deep (therefore not very cool and refreshing). Parking: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d got my head round the additional $15 a day for parking, annoying but went with eyes wide open. The self parking car park is really close to the hotel so I struggle to see the need to pay for valet. In fact my husband was the perfect valet parker....dropped us off by the lobby and then went and parked the car! Gym: Again I knew there was a daily cost of c. $10 to visit the gym. To be honest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have struggled to find time to get to the gym but given the cost of the hotel I certainly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to pay extra for the privilege! So all in all I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say the Hard Rock hotel was exactly the experience I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expected it to be and worth its weight in gold if your kids want to spend much of their day upside down on rollarcoasters!", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "galway", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely Going Back\u201d", "Author": "ktfloss", "ReviewID": "UR117804954", "Content": "We only picked this hotel so we could have the express passes for the attractions at Universal and Islands of Adventure.

Because our trip to the area was only to go to Universal Studios, we opted not to rent a car and just use the immediately available ameneties. The hotel is awesome -really cool and funky - tons of rock and roll odds and ends, the pool is beautiful and the restaurants within the hotel were very good (albeit a bit pricey, but we knew that going in). The staff was attentive and friendly. Check in was easy and although our room was not ready when we arrived (we were early), our bags were held, we were allowed to go to the pool, relax and have lunch while they readied our room. They called us once our room was ready and had arranged to have our bags brought up so we didn't have to pick them up from the baggage check area in the lobby. The walk to Universal Studios from the hotel was about 5 minutes through lushly landscaped grounds. I believe of the 3 hotels within Universal's grounds, this was closest to the park. The room keys allow you to bump to the from of most lines (except the Harry Potter ride in the castle), and being a hotel guest, you were allowed into the parks 1 hour before opening each day (very handy for the aforementioned HP ride, becuase the lines for that are huge once the park opens). Another bonus was anything purchased in the park gift shops can be sent to your room so you don't have to carry extra things around with you. If you go to Universal Studios for a vacation, I highly recommend staying at the Hard Rock for the convenience and the atmosphere.

Please note that Hard Rock is the CLOSEST one to the park entrances (by far!)

The room was up to date with plenty of TV stations, comfortable beds, nice furniture. A great little Keurig single cup coffeemaker in the room with an assortment of mini coffee/hot chocolate choices (no additional charge). Nice touch! There was a stocked mini-bar in the rooms with standard hotel items and charges. The staff was Terrific! Everyone from Reed who checked us in to the crazy entertainer guy at the pool (who had games for children and adults at the pool with a DJ from 4pm-7pm with movies at the pool until midnight. Totally enjoyable!) -- from the amply staffed concierge desks to the bellstaff (Mark who remembered my name hours after dropping off my luggage. Impressive.) Everyone was beyond expectation! Super! BTW, there was a Hertz rental car stand in the lobby that was super convenient for a daytrip we made to Epcot. MEERS Transporation provided a shuttle to and from the hotel to MCO Airport for $60 roundtrip. Tip: The 3rd Thursday of the Month Hard Rock has a different rock group setup into a converted lobby.

I can only recommend for those with family and I am usually hard on this having visited many countries and theme parks and stayed in several on the premises hotels.

I'd spent a lot of time checking reviews before I booked it over 9 months ago and took absolutely no notice of the ones that said 'this isn't somewhere you'd take your grandparents', which is just as well. Everything was easy when we checked in and the room was just fine. Loads of space and the air con hardly noticeable unlike some English hotels where it sounds like a jet engine's being tested for 8 hours at a time. Music everywhere so be prepared if you go. We were quite happy with it. The pool's really nice with one slight drawback and that is the pool depth. It needs to be a bit deeper than the maximum 4ft but it didn't spoil anything. It was great to see people being able to sit in the pool with glasses of drinks served by the many servers. You need to be warned that although the prices for food aren't bad, there's always going to be extra for the tips. We had breakfast at The Kitchen each day and for the two of us, including the tip, it was $50. that sounds extortionate but it was a buffet breakfast and neither of us needed to eat again til late afternoon so it was good value and the food was excellant. There's masses to choose from. Fresh fruit, pancakes, waffles, packs of cereal, pastries, scrambled eggs, hash browns, corn beef hash, bacon and sausages. You can have hot chocolate or coffee and orange juice. It was all delicious. Best scrambled eggs I've had anywhere other than my house. We also ate at the Poolside restaurant which was also good. Bit of a wait for the food but not a problem as you can watch the evening film or the storm, whichever has priority at the time. Don't worry about the storms, they're spectacular but brilliant. All the hotel staff are helpful and respectful and seem to enjoy what they're doing. I've always thought the Americans have customer service off to a T and the Hard Rock is a good example of this. Housekeeping start really early so don't forget to put the 'leave me alone' card on your door if you don't want waking up before 9am. Good news about the shampoo. It's good quality and you don't need to wash your hair again with the one you've brought with you. Just a small thing but bottles of shampoo can be left at home. There's a shuttle bus to Wet n Wild, Sea World and Acquatica. It doesn't run that frequently and you have to make sure you book it at reception the day before you want to go or you won't be able to get on the bus. The shuttle boat is brilliant but keep in mind that if there's a hint of a storm, it doesn't run. This isn't the end of the world as it's only a 10 minute walk back to the hotel. An alternative to the boat is the small army of cyclists who will take you from the boat landing at the hotel to the entrance to Universal Studios. It'll take you beyond that if needs be. It's not far to walk but having a small limitation on my mobility, it was brilliant to be able to hop on one of these and get cycled the couple of minutes it takes to get there. There's no specific charge but they ask that you give a fair amount to cover the charge of the bike they're hiring etc. Emacks and Bolios ice cream parlour. What can I say!!! This is brilliant. When you ask for one scoop be aware it's like a spadefull compared to what we get in England. Not cheap but not an arm and a leg either. We loved it. I'd definitely do Hard Rock again but would keep it to just a few days only because we would want to stay in Florida for more than a week and I'd want to be a bit more central for the other theme parks. Excellant place. Not cheap if you're on a budget but stretch it, it's worth every penny. And don't forget. It absolutely issssssss somewhere you can take grandparents.

The room was very clean and the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. The pool is gigantic and nice, with lots of great seating and free big towels. The best part about the hotel is that you can walk out the back gate and be in the park almost immediately. If you don't want to walk to the park entrance you can get the water taxi or the bike taxis tp take you to the gate. This makes the day so much more pleasant because when you get too foot sore, hot and tired you can just go relax at the nice pool and let the kids use their boundless energy to slide down the water slide in the pool. Of course, the other great perks are the express line tickets and being allowed in the Harry Potter section one hour early. It was kind of thrilling to realize how many hours of waiting in lines that we avoided. The downsides are how very expensive the meals and drinks are at the restaurants. Since we had our car there we could easily drive to any of the local restaurants and bring back sodas and snacks with us so that did not matter so much. The cost of parking was high as well. The one really annoying thing was that you had to pay to use their wireless connection inside the room. My teenager spent too much time in the lobby and/or the pool when she should have been able to stay in the room and skype with all her buddies. I would think that with the high cost of this room they could provide wireless connections free since I can get that at a $56/night Econolodge! Anyway, all in all I would say that it was definietely worth it to stay in his hotel after you figure the cost of the express line tickets and park tickets for the entire family and factor in the convenience. One more comment: the last night we were there we went to the new Harry Potter movie and on the way back a bad storm blew up. The back gate gets locked when the pool is closed and the pool was closed early due to bad weather. A half dozen of us were trying to get the back gate to open when a really nice staffer opened an employee back door and motioned us in. As we entered she handed each of us a big, warm towel.

Club Level is wonderful and the staff is terrific. Our room was approximately 500 sq ft. It had two queen size beds along with a pull-out couch. Very large bathroom and a nice changing area with a huge closet. Nice keurig coffee maker and mini bar with all the accompaniments. The beds are ultra comfortable and the decor very appealing. Love the rooms that over-look the pool. The bath has everything you may need with excellent products such as shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, q tips, cotton balls. If you may have forgotten anything just call and ask! Nice plentiful fluffy towels. I just love entering this hotel into that grand lobby with all that terrific memorabilia! Take a stroll to each floor and see what collections await you. Lots of fun to do that. They have a well stocked store with more great rock and roll gifts. I always buy something there and usually want much more. The restaurants and snack bar, ice cream shop have never disappointed. We enjoy breakfast at The Kitchen when we aren't staying club level. Reasonable prices, great service in a nice funky atmosphere. That reminds me - the staff at this hotel are ALL so cool! They are helpful and so much fun. We have made many friends over the years as they seem to retain their staff for long periods of time. They all seem quite happy to be working there. One of my favorite locations at Hard Rock is their pool area - simply amazing and very well done. We rent a cabana one day each trip and just have the best down-time day relaxing and enjoying the music and great drinks and food. Again I cant say enough about the pool staff they are great. The pool has a fun fast slide, Jacuzzis and a very large swimming pool. There is a bar and bar service at your chairs. Nice reasonable menu at the pool too. Keep in mind gratuities are already added. Emack and Bolios for an ice cream at the end of pool day hits the spot and they have some very creative creations. My kids love this place.

Beds were fantastic, nice big flat screen tv, and the girlfriend loved the shampoos, lotion ect. Place had a Keurig coffee maker which was very nice, especially on the mornings you got up early to hit the park. The pool and the dj there were fantastic. The dj kept the pool crowd entertained and the waterslide was great for all ages. Drinks are a little pricey, but you can bring your own in with you to save a few bucks. Only issue we had was that we had paid extra for a pool view room and when we got to our room there was a huge palm tree taking up 75% of the window. You could only see a little corner of the pool if you stood on a chair. We talked to the front desk and they resolved it by refunding the difference between our room and a garden view room (which was very nice of them to do). If you see postcard pictures of the backside of the hotel those pictures were taken a while ago when the palm trees were a lot smaller. Those trees have grown folks, and many of the \"pool view\" rooms are now partially to fully obstructed pool view rooms. So TIP #1: you probabally should not pay extra for a \"pool view\" room. Tip #2: You gotta hit the ice cream place on the first floor. It is fantastic - I got the banana split, it was huge and delicious!! Our only minor complaint it that for the price you pay to stay here parking should be included in the room cost. Cost is $15 per day, $22 if you want valet service.

When he started to listen he simply gave me a room credit and a couple of beers but since I was spending over USD 1,000 a night that was was not really the answer. But, having said all that it is probably the best of a bad bunch and very close to the park. Loews only the other hand should be ashamed of themselves and get some management in there - it's a total and utter shambles and needs to be gripped tightly before it gets a real reputation.

We stayed in the King deluxe room. It is all one room, but there is a sitting area on one side of the room, and a nice size table for eating or using the computer on the other side. Bring a cooler to use in the room since there is no microwave or refrigerator. The minibar requires a key that is issued to you and can keep kids from using it without your knowledge. That can cut down on unintentional charges to your room. The bathroom area is two areas. The vanity area, separated from the sleeping area by a wall for privacy, and a shower / toilet area that is behind a bathroom door for privacy from the vanity area. There is a room safe in the closet. There's plenty of dresser drawers for clothing, but not much surface area since the TV sits on top of the dresser. The kingsize bed was comfortable, and our daughter slept in a rollaway bed that was decent. I did get a little annoyed at the $10 charge each day for intenet access. The airconditioning was adequate and quiet, but I would have preferred a more powerful unit. We brought along night lights to guide us to the bathroom at night and were glad we did since the black out curtains did a wonderful job, but left no ambient light to navigate around the room at night. The hotel pool is great, the location is great, and the rock memorabilia are great. The early entry to Universal studios is the overall factor for choosing Universal property hotels because the room rate and the food at the hotel are expensive.The pool is not deep and isn't intended for diving. It more for lounging. There is a pool slide, a stage for pool parties and a nice hot tub. There's afternoon entertainment like hula hoop contests and the pool employees make sure only hotel guest have access to the grounds. It's about a 10 to 15 minute walk to Islands of Adventure from the hotel if you stroll instead of rush.One of the high points of staying at a Universal hotel was having breakfast at the Three Broomsticks at Hogsmeade in Universal's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. You can only do this if you book a hotel package that included park tickets. We got a reservation for 8am, were at the main gates at 7:45 am, allowed in by showing our tickets for breakfast, walked to Hogsmeade with nobody in our way, and were admitted into the Three Broomsticks at exactly 8am. That alone was worth the price of the hotel room. No crowds and a chance to eat in peace in Hogsmeade and to imagine the students of Hogwarts showing up to eat and chat. Just remember to bring a cooler for the hotel room, leave time to enjoy the pool, and if you hate the prices of the hotel food, head over to the eating places just 4 blocks away on the main drag.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it and will be back\u201d", "Author": "hockeymoo1021", "ReviewID": "UR115937944", "Content": "We were pleasantly surprised at checkin when we we rec'd a room upgrade and it just got better from there.

Check in was easy, it was easy to pick up our tickets to Islands of Adventure and Studios, and service at all times was great. Keep in mind it is a resort, and so it can be expensive to eat at the hotel, at nearby City Walk and in Islands of Adventure and Studios (in some ways, it is cheaper to eat in Islands of Adventure and Studios than at the hotel or City Walk). The shop on level 1 of the hotel does sell doughnuts, coffee and other items for breakfast or a small snack. There are also a few fast food options at City Walk. The hotel is about a short 5 minute walk (or water taxi) to Islands of Adventure and Studios. The room slept well and was very quiet. Be sure to take an afternoon from the parks to spend some time at the hotel pool, which had wonderful entertainment in the afternoons (and a movie in the evenings). The pool is open until midnight, which I really enjoyed after each day in the park. I did have an issue with booking on-line.

We all had a blast! We wanted to stay onsite so we could visit Harry Potter world (we are real fanatics), and this was the best place to do it. Early park access to HP world and fastpasses throughout other rides. Seriously, the only way to go. As far as the hotel itself is concerned, think of it as your only chance to live like a rock star! We booked a Kids suite on the Club level. The suite was very roomy and although there was only one bathroom, it was brilliantly laid out. The \"master\" side of it is a double sink with a shower while the other side of it includes a toilet and a tub/shower. Both sides are set off with a locking door. I found it to be surprisingly convenient for us. We also rented the cabana and used the fitness center and pool area. The fitness area was smallish, but it had a good variety of machines and some free weights. The floor was a bit dirty (and the yoga mats a bit smelly), but I was too, so I overlooked that. But I can see others having issue with the fitness area floor being dirty. The Palm restaurant was fantastic and well worth the money. I was surprised how comfortable the bed was--Frankly, I expected less. But some of the patrons on the floor were quite noisy walking by at late hours (yes, kids run around at 11pm!!). Bring earplugs if you are sensitive (I did and I was fine). It wasn't noisy the entire time, just on occasion (and in our case it seemed to be the same noisy family every time). I have to say that club level is really the best way to go. Lots of included amenities and the food holds you over so you don't have to spend even more $$ for the overpriced food there. That being said, the overpriced food is pretty good and you can split plates (they are large portions). Happy hour at the Club lounge was very nice and the concierge there were so friendly. Big plus-- if you are planning to rent a cabana, you get a discount if you are on Club level. The pool cabanas are fun-- you get a ceiling fan and a TV (I know, why watch TV when you are outside at the pool but for some reason, it was actually relaxing for a short while). You also get a fridge with sodas, water, plus a fruit basket and ice cold chilled towels (for cooling off in the heat). You also get very attentive servers who are so very nice!! When we rented one, it was my daughter's 17th birthday and we purchased a balloon bouquet from the hotel service itself. Yes, it was $25 (ugh) but considering all the other high expenses, I felt lucky it really wasn't more. And, it meant alot to her to see the cabana decorated! As far as the pool, if you can stay there while the pool DJ show is going on, you should. They have lots of activities out there and some fun contests. (Husband won the hula hoop contest and got a free drink not to mention bragging rights to being able to hula hoop for a good 7-8 seconds!). The pool vibe was just fun-- and after the show, they had a movie right there. We didn't want to leave for dinner so we had food delivered out at the pool. Very cool!! Our last day, we lunched in the Kitchen- they have a giant $18 burger that you must try. I believe it was 18 oz patty or something crazy like that! But so so so good!!

We chose this hotel b/c it is one of 3 on-site hotels at Universal Orlando that offers free EXPRESS PASS at the 2 theme parks. This benefit is worth its weight in GOLD if you ask me! The best part of this hotel is that it is a VERY EASY 5 minute walk from our hotel room to the entrance gates of Universal Studios and maybe 8 minutes walk to the entrance gates of the Islands of Adventure. This is why I say this hotel has the BEST LOCATION. We loved the Pool, which has a very long and fun slide at one end (which my kids loved!). They also show family movies at the pool every night that we were there. Our only complaints are about our club level room, which comes with free access to the Club Lounge on the 7th floor. The lounge serves breakfast, lunch time snacks, dinner time beer/wine/light meal foods and desserts. The food quality is nothing special, but it is VERY CONVENIENT (especially to grab breakfast before going to the theme parks). However, the breakfast and dinner time servings had a MUCH BETTER selection of food than the lunch time snacks (only offered sodas and chips) and desserts (only offered milk/cookies). We spotted at least 2 different groups of people sneak into the Club Lounge for free food when it was obvious they were NOT staying on our floor. Our only other complaint was that the A/C in my room didn't keep the room very cold despite setting the A/C at its coldest setting all day long. It got down to mid 70's most of the daytime and would FINALLY cool down to 68 degrees by 3 or 4 am-ish.

We stayed on the Club level and it was a zoo in there. The line for food was so long each day at 5 oclock we couldn't believe it. I would recommend it for families with more than two kids as the breakfasts were wonderful. The Kitchen Restaurant is fantastic for dinner, you can go casual right from the pool. Also, the pool is one of the best features of the hotel. My 10 year old couldn't get enough of the water slide and fun pool games going on all the time. Plus, there are movies going on at the pool each night. One of the things that I couldn't get past was the fee to use the gym ($10/day)! I have never heard of that, but if you stay on Club level, it is waived. The rooms are fine, nothing spectacular...the maid service was not so hot.

No one seemed to know anything when we brought it up that we left them in our room. Other than that the service and hotel were great and we would definitely return. Tips - stay at one of the three hotels on Universal Property and use your room key to fast pass rides - it is worth every penny because it saves hours waiting in line. Go to the Harry Potter experience at 5pm when everyone clears out for dinner. It hardly has a wait time and you cannot fast pass the ride in the castle. If you can afford club level, it is pretty good for breakfast, sodas and snacks all day. 5pm is happy hour with cheese, crackers and kabobs.

Our room was on the first floor (as requested) and our bellman pointed out that although we were very far from the lobby and main part of the hotel, we were just steps from the side door to the pool and the walkway to Universal. It was super convenient. The room was clean and comfortable, but aside from 2 rock photos, nondescript. We had a view through the bushes of the pool area. The pool area is very loud and when we went to bed around 11:30 Saturday night, we could still hear music, etc. The pool area itself is great, with a huge pool. It never felt crowded. They have a sand \"beach\" for some reason, which i found more annoying than fun, because my feet kept getting sandy and there was a lot of sand in the pool. The hot tubs were crowded but nice, and my kids liked the waterslide. We ate dinner at The Kitchen. Food was good, service was slow. While we ate Bart and Homer Simpson stopped by for photo ops. They have a good ice cream shop that also sells breakfast food, which saves time on the way to the parks. Overall, I would stay there again. It is a lovely hotel.

Had to send them back, and took over 20 minutes before I asked where they were. The manager comped them for us which was nice. Best of all is the short walk to the two parks.

We had a 6:00 am flight and we arrived in Orlando at 9:00 am. We got to the Hard Rock Hotel around 10:30 am. We checked in and received our Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and City Walk passes. We were told that we would receive a phone call/text when our room was ready. Typical check in time is 4:00 pm -however, we read in the hotel policies that if a room is available prior to 4:00 they will assign it to you. We gave our luggage to the hotel to hold until the room was ready then we walked over to Universal Studios. 4:00 came and we still hadn't receved a call or text telling us that our room was ready. By now we had been up since 3:00 am -we were tired and hot (it was 48 degrees when we left home so, we weren't exactly dressed for 90 degree Florida weather) and just wanted to get into our room to freshen up -change clothes and relax a little. We went back to the front desk and pretty much pleaded for a room. We were finally assigned a room on the 1st floor. We went to retrieve our luggage and were told that the hotel staff would deliver it in about an hour. We didn't want to wait another minute to freshen up and change into \"Florida\" clothes so, we said that we'd take our own luggage to our room.... they didn't seem pleased with that -but we weren't really pleased either so, we insisted that we'd take it ourselves. If we'd waited for them that would've been at least another hour that we had to wait to change and what good was getting into the room without any of our stuff?? Getting into the room was our biggest complaint -there had to be a room somewhere in that hotel that was available before 4:00. This is one reason why I gave them 3 stars. Other than the room issue -the staff was pleasant -actually everyone in the hotel seemed nice. We ate at 'The Kitchen' a few times -everyone seemed nice and friendly and the food was pretty good. The pool was always crowded but there was plenty of poolside chairs available and room for more people without seeming over crowded. If you exited through a gate near the back of the pool and followed a path City Walk and the 2 theme parks were a short 10-15 minute walk away -this is a big bonus... no waiting for buses! Bicycle taxies were available at both ends of the path -these people work for tips only so, tip good if you ever use them. It was nice to get a ride back from the parks at the end of the day. There isn't a fridge available in the room (big thumbs down -another reason for the 3 stars) they do have a locked (the key is available at the front desk) mini bar with unreal prices -like $7.00 for a bottle of water. We ended buying water at the hotel store and filling up our ice bucket every night and using it like a cooler to keep the water cold in case we were thirsty in the middle of the night. A regular empty fridge for our use at no charge (like they have in the Disney hotels) would have been great. We read that they will switch the mini bar out for a regular fridge for a fee of $25 then charge $15 p/day on top of that to keep the fridge. There is also a small safe available for a p/day fee -again Disney gives you use of the same exact safe at no charge. The hotel and our room were neat and clean. Even though we were out of the room for most of every day no one showed up to clean our room or give us fresh towels. By the 3rd day we had to call down to the front desk and ask for fresh towels and to have our trash emptied. They were apologetic and sent someone right up. Would we stay here again...??? Maybe -but, we think that we like the way Disney runs their hotels better. We also liked how Disney gives you one card for your room key, park passes, etc -1 card covers everything. At Universal we had a room key/park express combo pass card, City Walk pass card and Universal/Islands of Adventure pass card. Having 1 card for everything is a lot better all around.

Can add that we checked in at 11 A.M. and our Level Club Room was ready, clean and with a wonderful water view, even it was a standard room. We bought Park Tickets at the Concierge Desk, for the same price as tickets bought online thru Universal's website. The Front Desk staff was very friendly. One night when leaving the hotel to dinner, I required a hairdryer at the front desk; my husband who was leaving the room to join me received it......... It took only 30 seconds\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6! The Level Club, as other reviewers said, worth the money. Limitless drinks as sodas, apple juice, water and coffee during almost all the day, plus other items already mentioned. (The Continental breakfast was great and with a wide selection of pastries, bread and cereals. All the Hors D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ouvre were fresh and flavorful. It varied every evening: something of vegetables, something of meat or chicken, sushi sometimes, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) Never felt that guests were observed/censured by the Lounge staff due to the consumed amounts of food or drinks.....It was usual that people took several sodas, juice or coffees to the room or when leaving towards the parks\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. In the Club Lounge Internet service was efficient. I could send my photos to a pendrive in seconds. They had also a printer there. We did not use the restaurants of the hotel except room service for a delicious Pizza. Even we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t requested drinks they send a complete silverware service, in a rolling table with 4 glasses, covered with plastic foil\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and it was only a pizza!

The beds were comfy, our special requests (for a fan and a mini-fridge) were accommodated quickly and efficiently, and the food and drinks were great. Try The Kitchen restaurant when you want to stay on property - I wasn't sure what to expect, based on the name, but it was truly terrific food. Ask to see the desserts, by the way - I won't spoil the surprise, but you'll be glad you did... We stayed on the Concierge Level, which may cost more but is completely worth it. Continental breakfast is available each day (assuming you can get there by 10am!), there are sodas and snacks available throughout the day, a 2-hour Happy Hour every evening, and even sweets at night. Best of all? The private concierges who were tremendously helpful and seemed to know everything! They made dinner reservations for us, recommended attractions - all the usual concierge stuff - but it was extra-nice because they got to know us by name, and know some of the details of our trip too.... we truly felt like VIPs. The Velvet Bar is very nice, by the way - and again, the servers were incredibly nice (shout-out to \"Rockin' Robin\" and Bree). The drinks were generously poured and very yummy. (My husband discovered a new favorite - called, if you can believe - a \"Bongwater\" - which he had every day!) As a bit of a \"wine snob,\" I was very happy with their selection... The whole \"rock n roll\" motif was kind of wasted on me, since I'm not a big rock person, but my family assured me it was wicked cool. Lots of memorabilia. One other nice thing: when you stay at the Hard Rock, you can also use the pool at the other 2 on-site resorts, the Royal Pacific and the Portofino Bay. We went to the Villa Pool at the Portofino Bay one day - it was much quieter and more \"adult\" (if smaller) than the pool at the Hard Rock. Very very nice. And they brought you chilled towels to cool your face - swanky! Speaking of pools, the one at the Hard Rock is amazing - a true highlight. There's an amazing water slide too, which my husband persuaded me to use - I felt like a luger at the Olympics! Getting around couldn't be easier - the water taxis are a nice way to take a load off when your feet are sore, but there's a LOVELY walking path as well. With a butterfly garden! Oh, you'll also find bicycle \"rickshaws\" - they work for tips only. Cool way to travel! All in all, our stay at the Hard Rock was great. The only small thing I can mention is that the towels in our room were quite rough.

The room that we got this time was the exact same standard room as before but they had just upgraded their carpeting and bedding. The soft , gentle colors were a sight for sore eyes and feet. Bedding was elegant, and provided a magical night's sleep. The pillows were numerous, room temperature-easily adjusted, sheets- soft and perfectly made and the new carpeting soft and plush. The flat screen tv still provide great reception and a variety (although not large) amount of channels. The furniture in the room is perfect for a family's stay with large drawers, closets, a safe (small, not large enough for a laptop), table and plush chair. Extra blankets and pillows were in the closets as well as 2 plush robes to use during our visit. The bathroom has been updated as well with new, bright white fabric shower curtain. With a split bathroom, an additional sink is located outside of the bathroom. This is wonderful for people getting ready at the same time. The granite countertops are very deep and filled with wonderful products to try. Speaking of products, my husband forgot his toothbrush and we forgot the toothpaste. One call downstairs and within 7 minutes, a gentle knock on our door, and we had 2 small toothpastes and two packaged toothbrushes. An in room coffee maker with choices of coffee, tea and hot chocolate was wonderful. We did not use the minibar but it was in the room. Wake up calls were perfect. For those of you who are \"Green\", the hotel supplies you with a \"green\" bag to put all your plastic, newpapers, cans etc for disposal. The pool is wonderful. Activities were plentiful all weekend long including our favorite, \"Dive In\" movie. It is the perfect place to sit while dining, drinking (amazing Vodka menu at the pool restaurant/bar!) in the evening. The best part is the early entry into the parks and is a MUST for all participating guest. With a quick walk, you are at the entrance of the parks or City Walk.

When we first arrived I got the valet to tend to my car (he was disrespectful and made me very uncomfortable to be handing over my keys). They wouldn't let me carry the bags and got a bell-hop to take our things. After checking in, we went up to our room and waited for nearly an hour. It was about 10:30 PM when we got to the room...my girlfriend had fallen asleep as I sat up to wait for our things. We woke up the next day ready to hit the parks, but wanted to eat breakfast first. We went to \"The Kitchen\" on the 1st floor of the hotel. We were greeted by a sour-faced hostess and served by an unkempt waiter who didn't seem to care about us being his guests. As I ate my breakfast I went to take a bite of my toast only to find a disgusting pubic-looking hair wrapped around it. They charge $10/day for wireless internet in the room which is just unacceptable when you're paying $200+/night for a hotel room. Even still I tried to pay and use the wireless as I had important items to take care of for work (I'm an online marketer), the wireless internet didn't even work when I tried to pay for it. I called the front desk and they were totally uninterested in helping, I didn't have time to wait on hold any longer for the \"tech support\" people. The following day I woke up early (I was told they had 'free internet' in the lobby). I went down with my laptop and was unable to connect. I approached the employees at the front desk and they simply laughed and said \"must be your firewall\" or something. At that moment another gentleman walked up behind me and said \"I can't get on the internet down here.\" They simply said, \"well, we could like call the tech guys or something but it should be working.\" Valet Parking: we went out to eat one night in downtown Orlando, when I had the valet pull my car up there was a giant splash of bird crap on the roof. When I had them pull it up the day we were leaving it was absolutely covered in leaves and flowers (not something I like to see on my $60k Audi, especially when I had to pay $22 a day plus tips for their awful valet service).

Unfortunately, after checking out we ventured over to Disney for a few days and the parks were absolutely mobbed. I am beginning to think Disney doesn't have any slow periods anymore. Very frustrating. Anyway, I can see where people may not like the pop/rock theme of the hotel. Its definitely not like any place I have ever stayed but thats what I loved about it. We didn't miss not having a balcony. The rooms were clean enough, but something about a hotel that allows pets really grosses me out. Just my opinion.

This year we splurged and booked a club room on the 7th floor. This floor has special amenities like food, drink, appetizers, desserts and a staff member available to help you and make dining reservations. This level is located on the 7th floor and when you check in they add a \"7th floor\" sticker to your key card. During my stay I noticed that the door always remained open and that families/individuals not staying on the floor were coming in to get food, drinks etc. I complained 3 different times. The final time I rode up on the elevator which stopped on the 6th floor and a family of 5 got on with me. I asked them if they were staying on the 7th floor and the told me \"no, we just came up to eat breakfast.\" I told them nicely that if they weren't staying on the floor and paying for it they couldn't eat up there. I went down to the front desk to complain in person and the lady at the desk immediately picked up the phone to call upstairs to tell them. When I went back up, there sat the family of 5 eating and there ID was never checked and they weren't asked to leave. This happened on many occasions and others were commenting about it as well. When I registered my first complaint via phone they told me it was an ongoing problem. You do need to swipe you key in a special slot on the elevator to even have access to the 7th floor but people ride up with you that don't belong up there. I have done the club level at Disney and have never had a problem. They're pretty strict about checking ID's etc so you can't go it if you aren't paying for the service. At over $500 there wasn't anything exclusive about being on that floor and I was disappointed that nothing was ever done about it or enforced after 3 complaints. I will say the hotel is conveniently located and the express passes are great. Overall, the hotel is beautiful and very clean and nice. If you stay there I would not recommend paying the extra money for the club level.

My kids this trip were 14 and 16. I give them the choice of Disney or Universal and they now always choose Universal (that is not a knock on Disney - we used to go there and did go there during our stay and it is much cleaner - but for their age they prefer City Walk and Universal for the rides). The best part of this hotel is the fact that it is close to City Walk and the 2 parks. It is an easy 5 minute walk to each but while at the hotel you really don't know the parks are there. The rock theme of this place keeps good music piped in the lobbies, elevators and pool most of the time. Someone previous posted that the staff is young, and they actually are, but very friendly and seem to know what they are doing. Clearly there are experienced people in charge somewhere. The pool is also one of the highlights for us. It has to be the most happening pool in the area. Very large, with a beach area, very good water slide and activities for kids of all ages to adult throughout the day. Eddie, one of the pool food and drink waiters is great. Up sells a little but knows what he is talking about where he works. Keeps you occupied all day. Great guy. The DJ Scooter who is there a couple of days per week keeps everyone laughing. The pool food that we had was very good every visit - although a little pricy - it is a resort. The Cuban sandwich is wonderful - best I have had. We have been to the other hotels on property and although nice - for teens and adults this place is more fun. Old people will prefer the Portifino. I really did not find much about the Royal Pacific to like. The other great part of staying here is the fact that you can use your hotel room key card as the express pass for rides. It works in a way that you can use it as many times as you wish on any ride and bypass most of the lines. Way better than Disney fast pass or the one you buy for day trips to Universal. You can literally go on the same ride over and over all day and bypass the main lines. If I had any complaint it would be that the hotel seems the same every year. Not that it is bad in any way, but it looks like it is time to upgrade the place. They were painting the hall while there but same tired color. The carpet in the halls, which is designed to hide dirt needs to be replaced. A freshening would help in the rooms and halls. Even the pool area could use a make over. Maybe some insulation between rooms and especially in the room doors as you hear every conversation from hall to room would help. Some new paint colors wold help to freshen up the place. Every place has it's time and this is the time to re-do. Watch for the taxes and the parking fees $15 I think and figure about $40 taxes for the room additional.

The convenience cant be beat -- a very short walk to Universal and just a bit more to Islands of Adventure. Very easy to come back and forth -- much easier than Disney. Your room key is your express pass to just about every attraction except the one main Harry Pottey ride (which is fantastic but the wait can get long). The pool is also great -- big, with plenty of loungers, plenty of towels, drinks / food, games, etc. Be warned, if you are looking for peace and quiet for your pool time, this is not the place for you. But it is lively and fun, and the music is great. I also found the pool and other common areas to be exceptionally clean and well appointed and very rock-appropriate. The staff is all very friendly -- they are mostly young and so it may be a less formal type of friendly that you'll find at other resorts -- but after all this is the Hard Rock and it does live up to its name! The rooms are a bit of a different story. The standard rooms are small and very basic. The hallways and rooms have more of a lower-end chain motel feel and they do not live up to the price. This is one of the reasons I dont think it deserves a 5. The other reason is cost / value-- you pay more here than other similar (although not as fun!) high end chains in the Orlando area, but some of that is convenience and the express pass at the parks. However, on top of the higher room rates, everything is extremely expensive -- more so than other resorts in the area. $15 a day plus tax to self park. Food and drink at the pool and other casual venues at the Hotel is really really high plus an 18% automatic tip. No free wi-fi in the rooms. All to be expected at a resort I guess, but with the daily parking charge, a few drinks/snacks at the pool and some partries, coffees and ice cream at the snack bar you'll nearly double your daily room rate each day.

Also on the trip were my in-laws.(2 parents, 3 kids 18, 16, and 11). The hotel is the closest LOEWS branded hotel to the two theme parks. Portofino is about a 10 minute further walk and Royal Pacific is across the highway, near Citywalk (there must be a walkway under to get to the theme parks). Hard Rock is a fun hotel, with rock music playing in all the common areas of the hotel and has a beautiful sandy beach pool, with full bar and food service at the pool area. If you are into rock and roll memorabilia, you won't be dissapointed. Preformers from all genre's, fromTwisted Sister to Elvis, have memorabilia hanging up everywhere in the hotel. We arrived early due to our flight and the hotel accomadated us right away, holding our luggage and letting us use the pool. The front desk took our cell phone number and got our room ready early for us and notified us right away when our room was ready. Our family stayed in the deluxe double queen with pull out couch. My son, age 14, slept on the pull out and he said it was comfortable.The mattress was memory foam, not the cheap, springy, thin fold up mattresses you normally find on a pull out sofa. The double queens were sufficient and the room was serviced everyday, with fresh towels and bed linens changed every third day, or on request. The room also had a nice flat screen TV and clean carpets. No wifi, which the hotel should consider adding since so many people travel with laptops now. Our only complaint about the room was the lack of hot water in the early morning (6-8am). After taking a cold shower 2 days in a row, I called the front desk and they sent someone right away to fix the problem. The maintenance man adjusted the handle on the shower. It didn't help much. We discovered if we let the water run for 5 minutes, it got hot and then we did not shut it off until everyone had showered. If you got it to get hot, it would stay hot indefinitely, we just felt bad wasting the water. The hotel did give us a free breakfast buffet to compensate us for our cold showers. This hotel is a great value if you add in the cost of the Express Pass. Without a doubt, no question, I would never visit Universal/Islands without the Express Pass. We could go on rides 3 or 4 times before people waiting in the general admission lines got on 1 time. If you purchase the Express Pass at the park and add it to your ticket (it costs around 60 dollars), you can only use it 1 time per ride. The hotel guests have UNLIMITED access to using the Express Pass. You show your room key to the attendant outside the ride, and presto, you go into a different line entirely, walking right past all the general admission ticket holders. At first, we actually felt guilty walking past the general admission people, (we got a lot of nasty looks) but we got over that quick, lol. A couple of tips if you are staying there. When you get there, take a cab or drive to the local Walmart (cab fare was 15 dollars with tip). I bought a disposable type styrofoam cooler, ( used ice from the hotel ice machine) a case of Dasani water and some beer, snacks for the kids and a loaf of bread and pb&j. We saved hundreds of dollars (I'm not kidding). The beer at the pool was 20 dollars for a 24 oz cup and waters in the room were 7 bucks a piece. OMG. That is my only complaint. Food and beverages are OUTRAGEOUSLY priced. Example, Emack and Bolios in the downstairs lobby serves a take away type breakfast. 2 bagels, 1 bottle of OJ and an egg sandwich was 28 dollars. Breakfast buffet (which is awesome) 4 adults, 6 kids, 178 dollars. Average lunch was 150 bucks. So packing a Universal Studios plastic bag with snacks, and ice and putting some beers and water in the bag when we were going to the pool really saved us $$, we were just careful not to get caught. The hotel seemed not to care of you brought any of that stuff to your rooms. All in all, our two families had an awesome time at the Hard Rock and we would stay there again. The hotel was fun for the kids, a party type atmosphere at the pool everyday, with games and a great water slide, and kids movies at night for night swimming.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Snowtot", "ReviewID": "UR98702716", "Content": "We stayed at the hard rock with close family, which included 4 children.

We arrived at the Hard Rock about four o'clock on a Saturday afternoon. Our room wasn't ready yet so we asked for the Universal tickets and our keycards. We had been before so we knew that our keycards were unlimited fast passes. This is a great bonus as my DD and my DH are huge fans of the Hulk rollercoaster and went on it about thirteen times in a row. We decided we would go to Universal and go on Rip Ride RockIt. The wait was only half an hour so we queued up. We returned to the hotel and our room was ready. We asked for a room with a roll away bed as I had two teenagers and they definitely didn't want to stay in the same bed as each other. The next day we took advantage of the early entry to Harry Potter World and went straight to the ride. Wow it is amazing. We went into a few shops, went on the other rides then went out. We still had 12 days left so we didn't feel like we had to spend all day in HP world as we could do it plenty of times. We got back to the hotel and went straight to the pool. The pool is lovely and clean. It hasn't really got a deep end but that didn't matter to me because I was mostly sun bathing when I was by the pool. Every time we were at the pool the sun shined and gave us a good relaxation from the hectic parks. There was a concrete part where sun beds were and a sand part too. If you wanted to get a sand part for the day you had to get to the pool. Also if you are going in June, July or August, try and get under an umberella, as it gets extremely hot. Some days we ate at the Kitchen. It is a bit expensive but it is well worth it for the quality of the food!! They have a good breakfast and the staff are very welcoming. Talking about staff everyone of them were kind and proffesional. When we arrived the bell boy accidently broke the handle off our suitcase and offered to pay for a new one out of his tips, now that's good service!!! We didn't take the offer but at the end of the stay he apologised again. The room service was great. We tipped the maid $2 every day and she was great. She folded and put away our clothes and even dried OUR wet towels and the hotel ones. She always tidied our toiletries and makeup away, she was just amazing.

We did not do the early AM entry to Harry Potter. Too many people do that so the lines wind up being long. During the regular hours we never waiting more than 30 mins. Priority seating at restaurants never was useful. Being able to charge to your room key is handy - especially when teens are on their own and need to purchase food. But watch out for limits as your cards get cut off if you exceed them. You need to work out limits with the front desk. Many restaurants in Citywalk give AAA discount so always ask.

I was mostly excited to visit the theme parks so I wasn't expecting anything special from the hotel and I was very pleasantly surprised. We absolutely loved this hotel! Classy decor, very nice spacious rooms with extremely comfortable beds with great pillows, wonderful view, beautiful pool. The hotel has its own arcade, the pool has a slide, and there is an adults only bar that is dimly lit and very nice. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived because we were very early but they called us with our room number within a half hour. Everyone behind the front desk is very friendly and knowledgeable and check-in was a breeze. If you are looking for a quiet getaway this is not the hotel for you. They are blasting music in the lobby and pool areas 24/7. It is definitely more of a party hotel. The hotel is conveniently located with just a short walk or water taxi ride over to Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios, and City Walk. I believe it is closer to the parks than both of the other hotels. Also it was completely worth it to stay there JUST for the hour early entry you get into Harry Potter World. It was a completely different experience being there without the crowd and walking right onto the ride in the castle as opposed to later in the day when it was packed full of rude pushy crowds. (Side note: The Forbidden Journey is AMAZING even though you will probably feel woozy by the end of it. Harry Potter World is the best part of the parks. Child like sense of wonder restored. Butterbeer and Pumpkin Juice are DELICIOUS!) Also great was having the ability to go back to our room to rest for a few hours after getting worn out at the park and being able to return a little while later. Loved staying on site! The food at the hotel restaurants was absolutely delicious. We ate at the Palms which was pricey but they give you copious amounts of food for it, and The Kitchen which was our favorite. City Walk was fun and they have some Harry Potter goodies in the Universal store if you don't feel like waiting in line at the park, but the selection is a lot more limited. We also had the chance to see Patton Oswalt perform live on stage at the Hard Rock which was great. My only critique is that everything is really overpriced, so steer clear of the awesomely stocked but ridiculously expensive mini-bar. Our friends spent $50 for2 pool side drinks (though they were doubles). The first morning I had a yogurt and tea and my bf had an egg and cheese sandwich from the little marketplace downstairs and it was $20. We also ordered room service on our last morning and it was $50 for a belgian waffle, the american breakfast(eggs, bacon, potatoes, english muffin) and a pot of tea (with 22% gratuity automatically included) but the guy who delivered it was really sweet, as were all of the staff. Just be willing to have to spend a lot of money for meals.

The room was clean, had a large desk, double dresser, large LG flat screen television. It also had comfortable additional seating. Our rooms overlooked a green area and provided nice privacy. The hotel is large, well appointed, and full of rock and roll memorabilia. We especially enjoyed the close proximatey to both Universal Studio theme parks. We walked each morning to the parks and appreciated the early admittance that staying on property allowed us. We were able to ride the rides and see the attractions we wanted to before the park was open to the general public. The close proximatey to Universal and City Walk allowed us to do the parks in the morning and early afternoon, come back to the room for a rest, and then head back out for an evening trip to the parks and City Walk. It allowed us more time in the parks and a more pleasant, fun experience. We did not use the fitness center, there is a $12.00 per day/per person charge. This seemed excessive to us. I realize this probably keeps unattended children out of the workout area, but we refused to pay more for a workout. We also were surprised that the internet is still be charged for, still? really?

The weather, the location and the parks are just to much fun. VALUE: OK----you can rate this two ways: 1---Actual cost of the hotel room. YES, you can get cheaper rooms within walking distance of Universal. BUT, #2 is the value of the Universal Express Pass-----$179.99 at the gate, per person for Express Pass for 2-parks, per day. So, multiply that by EIGHT, and the VALUE of the Express Pass pays-for-the-room!!---now, that is Value in my eyes (WARNING---once you get the Express Pass option---you will NEVER stay off-property again----we can get thru Universal in 3 hours...all rides except Rock Rocket, and about 3 hours for I-O-A (excluding the Harry Potter mayhem). ROOMS: Due to our group of 8, I have to get two rooms. I had two Deluxe Queen Rooms, next to each other, on the 3rd floor. No door between, but next door. Rooms were HUGE, and for all the traffic thru these hotel rooms, the rooms are in fairly good shape. Nice bathrooms, Nice beds, sitting area/living room. Plenty of space. STAFF: Very accomodating and very friendly. WI-FI & Internet: OK----they nickel-and-dime you to death here....but, so do all resort type hotels in Orlando. WI-FI IS NOT FREE in the rooms....but, get over it. You don't come here to sit in your room and surf the internet. I am sitting on a big couch, right now, in the Velvet Lounge, with an adult beverage, fast internet. The huge lobby has all the teenagers Facebooking.....but, the internet is free in the Bar/Lounge...so, no kids here. BELL HOPS: Ob-nox-ious if you don't use them----they will guilt you into using them--and, then expect a huge tip. I mentioned it to the check-in staff and they agreed that other guests had complained in the past. RICKSHAW BIKES: More obnoxious than the bell hops. These vultures hang out at every pedestrian exit of the property, and \"guilt\" you into a ride (big/huge signs on bikes state that they receive no income and work for tips only)....so, they will hound you for cash. And, no matter what amount you provide....they will make you feel like you short-changed them. DO NOT use the rickshaws---Hard Rock is easy walking distance to the Theme Parks (really short distance). POOL: Outstanding!!! Just a fun place for everyone. Yes, kids everywhere----but, it is a Theme Park resort.....not an adults only resort. If you don't want kids everywhere, visit a Senior Citizen Center in Orlando. You can easily loose track of time in the pool area...with a bar, movies and water slide. Plus ping-pong and other games/events. FITNESS CENTER: I did not spend the money to utilize....instead, I jogged each day along the walking paths between Hard Rock, Portifino Hotel and City Walk. Well lit, and a fun run (and free). DOOR KEYs: Not only are the door keys used as express pass access, but you can put \"amounts\" on each card for your family members to spend. Kids love that option--makes them feel like a big-deal signing for food, beverages and other items. PARKING: NOT free. $15/day with in-n-out privileges. DINING: Breakfast is NOT included. But, Wendy's and McDonalds are withing 1 mile of the hotel. I made it from McDs and Wendys back to the hotel with hot food in under 15min and saved a-ton-of-money. Ate at \"The Kitchen\".....expensive ($175 for 8) and horrible service (just terrible......server could care less about our group....kept messing up the beverage orders EACH TIME he came to the table. Abandoned us for 15+min at a time.....just brutally horrible service).....but, great food. Ate at \"The Palm\"....very well known steakhouse......expensive ($150 for 2, with no bottle wine....just glass of wine each).....but exquisite steak and service. Overall, we will come back each year---forever---and stay here for our Annual Family Christmas Retreat. You cannot beat the value of the passes and the proximity of the property to the parks. It is just to convienent and fun. Be forewarned....the hotel was COMPLETELY BOOKED for the 3 days we were here.....I booked my room back in April for a December visit......and that was before the Potter mayhem.

It was nice to get a coffee or hot chocolate before heading to the parks. Also, coming back and grabbing a snack throughout the day. We may stay in a club room again with the boys however, it would need to be a package deal. Our boys may enjoy it more and it may seem like a better deal since they could fill up on some of the food and snacks there too. The hotel itself was of course great. They seem to be making the effort to increase customer service. I have never has so many conversations with staff while at any hotel. Everybody was kind and fun to talk too. I could really see a difference from the last time we stayed there and it did not come off like it was forced either. The beds were great and the rooms where are very well cleaned. My wife is a stickler for clean rooms and it passed her test each day. We ate at the Kitchen for breakfast when we first arrived and even though the buffet is expensive it still is cheaper then ordering individual meals. The pools were clean and we used them despite the weather. Especially the hot tub. My one concern is that there is a adult only hot tub but yet parents still allow kids into this area. What is up with that? There is a sign. Can you read it? It just bothers me when other ASSUME it will be OK for 6 younger kids to enter this area. The parks where great although dated. The grinch breakfast is a must. Great time, OK food, but the characters make up for it. The Macy's parade was nice and the Grinch show was very entertaining. Got to get on all the rides and the lines were minimal for all areas including Harry Potter. Cannot see waiting in line for any store or a wand for that matter. Did not waste our time. Frozen Butterbeer was great even though the temps in the morning was in the upper 30's. Getting into the parks an hour early was a plus since we were able to do that entire area in that hour. For the most part the parks were dead this time of year as they usually are. I was told that after the first weekend in December to a few days before Christmas the parks are quiet. The holiday village is a dissappointment. The parks were all decorated nicely but the dated rides and the unused space at Universal allows you to completely do both parks in one day. We had 4 days in the parks and started looking for things to do but that could have been since we had been there so many times prior and knew what we wanted to do and not do. Twister? really? That movie is older then my kids and not a very good one too. The parks need updating and quickly. Workers in Harry Potter did not enjoy me asking for Team Edward or Team Jacob apparel. I am not a big Harry Potter person. Bottom line is that the hotel is great, location is great and the parks are dated. If you get a chance to go to the City Walk, hit the Rising Star, karokee bar.

Except for one request for a restaurant booking, the Club 7 staff referred us to the Front Desk, which sort of defeated the purpose. The rooms are lovely and good sized. Two double beds in our room with ample room for walking around, as well as an armchair and a large oval table and two chairs made for a comfortable stay. The room was clean and well-maintained. The bathroom, though nicely set up with a sink and vanity outside, and another sink, toilet, and tub/shower on the inside, it was awkward to close the door to the toliet area without stepping to one corner and performing a little dance to get to the tub without climbing over the toilet. Housekeeping was wonderful. They somehow knew when we were out of the room, cleaned and were long gone by the time we got back. One day we just relaxed in the room after a late night, and housekeeping was kind enough to look in on us before going home to see if we wanted more towels or anything else. The lovely large windows do not open in the room, which would have been nice for some freah air. Though the A/C did its job well, albeit a bit noisily at times. The internet was horrible. Bad enough you have to pay for it, but when it becomes intermittant and very slow, it is a problem. It is $10/day and really not worth the aggravation. There is a single computer available for guest use in the Club room, and it was always easy to take a few minutes to check email and reservations, etc. And even it was slow at times. The hotel itself was nicely maintained and lively with rock music playing in the public areas. It was always fun trying to \"name that song\" whenever in the elevators. Some have claimed the music is too loud and pervasive, though we did not find this to be so at all. The staff were ever-helpful and present, which made getting information and advice easy. We went to The Palms restaurant on site, and after hearing so much about it, thought that it was a bit over-hyped. We had dinner there one evening, and though the service was attentive and the menu diverse, the steaks themselves were quite mundane and nothing special at all. My filet mignon was nicely seasoned and well cooked, but a poor piece of meat. Period. And this was largely the case for the rest of our party. Sides are okay and plentiful, but nothing special (and we at additionaly cost) We went swimming at the pool and were not pleased. Too many people, not enough chairs and the pool area seemed a bit unkempt and sad. It did not help that the pool was overun by screaming and inconsiderate children. The pool is largely 3 feet deep in most places, with only one small area being around 5 feet -- which, you guessed it, was where they were holding kids games and donut eating contests. We went once and did not go back again. I cannot emphasize enough how good a location this hotel is. It is literally steps from the Universal parks via a nice walkway, or by boat. We were able to walk between both parks and Citywalk within just a few minutes. Do go and see the Blue Man show if you can -- it is fun for kids and adults alike. We also took advantage of the many movies showing at the Multiplex theatre, with a great $5 morning special for even new releases. There are plenty of restaurants to try also, including some fast food uptions. We walked over to the Portotino resort and walked around. It is nicely done, but quite spread out. We also went over to the Royal Pacific and enjoyed a lovely sushi dinner there. It's a nice hotel, but also with a shallow pool. (they don't encourage guests from one hotel to swim in the other hotel pools, but we had to go and have a look to see if there were other options) All in all, a good stay. and we were able to see and do just about all Univeral had to offer. The parks are not as extensive as Disney, and that was fine for us. If there were not other things to do in the immediate area, after 3 days of parks we would have been bored. And we also wondered why a large percentage of Universal's rides include having water thrown at you. There was hardly a ride or show that water was not a factor.

We did not have much for a view, but the window was so small it did not matter. We overlooked a quiet lawn area and could briefly see the shuttle boats go by. Unfortunately the shuttles did not run as often to/from this hotel as the other 2 onsite properties. When you're hot and tired after a grueling day at the parks, it is most frustrating to see 3 or 4 boats for the other hotels come and go while you are still standing in the hot sun waiting for yours. Several times we gave up and walked (10-15 minutes to the parks), or took a pedicab when they were available. We were not very impressed wih the food anywhere at the HR. There is a large but poorly designed takeout place on the 1st floor, with very limited selection. Poolside bar serves a decent mahi sandwich. For us, the music in every public space got very annoying after a few days. I realize that music is a big part of the HR philosophy, however a quiet area would be appreciated. We did not try the on-site Fulton's Crab House, as it was very noisy with drunken conventioneers.

Downside: I realize it is fairly normal to nickel and dime at hotels like this, but we found the parking to be a bit excessive.

The hotel was beautiful, the staff was always courteous and very helpful with any questions I had, and all of the rock memorabilia was fun to look over. One of the reasons we choose the Hard Rock over the other two Universal hotels was the pool and it was everything I had hoped for -- warm water, sand \"beach\", and prompt poolside service (the onion rings are amazing!). The rooms were plenty big for a family of four and the bathroom had two sinks (one inside with the tub and toilet and a larger one between the bedroom and the bathroom) which was a big bonus. The park was a very short walk and we never had to wait more than five minutes to ride the boat over to CityWalk. Granted, parking is not cheap (around $15 per day), but I am used to that with all the business travel that I do. The only thing I would say could use improvement was the wireless service. You do have to pay for wireless in the rooms (free in public areas), but the signal usually was too weak to be useful. You can confirm your flight and print your plane tickets for free in the business center so who really needs a computer anyway? I looked into staying across the street but really didn't want to bother with driving or taking a shuttle to the park when we could stay so close and have all the other benefits that onsite offers. As everyone mentions, the Express Pass for the park (your room key) is such a huge benefit. We went in October when the park was less crowed and really did just walk up to the rides without waiting. Unfortunately, for some of the rides I wanted a little bit more time to change my mind, but I was shown to my seat before I could chicken out! We did not take advantage of the early entry to the park, but I could see that being quite valuable in the busy seasons. Our main reason for going to Orlando was to visit the Wizarding World and it was fantastic! I would have loved to have more than the 2 1/2 days we spent in the park to explore and really take in all the little details that are everywhere to discover. Ollivanders was well worth the wait and make sure you take time to really appreciate Hogwarts and all the details that I noticed most people were racing past to get on the ride. One other thing that we really enjoyed about the Hard Rock was being able to go to the other Universal hotels and tying out their pools! The Hard Rock pool was open until 11 PM every night we were there so we had plenty of time to relax and enjoy it after walking around the park for so long.

The first time in 2009, was our first visit to Universal Studios Orlando, after having always been exclusively, devoted Disney followers. Although we find the hotel pricey, we thoroughly enjoy our stays here. The pool is our kids' favorite pool I think anywhere we've ever stayed, and there have been several amazing ones for them to pick from. I think what we love about the pool is it is appealing to both the kids and the adults. There is always daily pool games for the kids, and often bands that play in the evenings. The pool has a sand beach on one side and concrete on the other for those that don't want to deal with the sand. There is a great water slide, and volleyball court adjacent to the pool. The hotel is beautiful! It is big, but easy to navigate. We've ironically never eaten in the restaurants inside the hotel, but always use the poolside restaurant and Emack and Bolio's Ice Cream Parlor. Rooms are great- big, well decorated, nice bathroom, nice shampoos, and great individual packet capsule coffee maker. Beds really comfortable. We love all the rock memorabilia throughout the lobby and public spaces- there are tons of celebrity costumes and clothing- Kiss, Elton John, Elvis. Best part of the hotel? Hands down is the short walk to the two Universal Theme parks. That is why we originally stayed here and also why we came back and will be revisiting again this coming summer. Negatives- charge per day if you want a mini frig. The first time we stayed in 2009, it was complimentary- they sent one to our room free of charge when we requested it. This past year, there was a charge, and I want to say it was $25 for the stay. Instead I made room in the minibar and added a few things, even though the sign said not to disturb the items or you would be charged. Daily parking charges, which always get me angry at any hotel, though my husband says I need to just pipe down about that! :LOL! Positives- FOTL pass at the parks, the close walk, and the pool!

We did show it at check in and they tried to upgrade us to a King Suite but they were unable to find another room within close proximity for my kids so we didn't take it. There were laundry facilities on our floor ($2.75 for each) which we could have used to dry our clothes after getting soaked on some of the wetter rides. There is a clothesline in the bathroom, as well as small sinks within each WC and a vanity and sink area outside of each bathroom. This worked well for our family, but having two bathrooms was worth paying for two rooms. The lobby and pool are LOUD! My family enjoyed it but if you don't like loud music you may want to stay elsewhere. You cannot escape it within the hotel or at the pool. The kid activities at the pool were great for my 10 and 13 year old girls but my 14 year old son did not participate. He had a great time swimming and going down the slide. We ate at the Kitchen once for dinner. The food was good and the waiter was fabulous. He made my kids feel like celebrities. Homer and Bart Simpson were wandering around and went to each table and posed for pictures. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel. The Universal rep at the Hard Rock (next to the concierge) made us reservations for the breakfast at the Three Broomsticks . You can't make these reservations before you arrive and you must pay for them when you make them, Apparently there are only a few available because they are supposed to be part of a special Harry Potter package, but we didn't have any problem.. We had an 8:30 reservation and were able to ride several rides before we ate (wich was probably just as well for our stomachs!). The other days we ate cereal that I brought and supplemented with fruit and muffins from the small convenience area inside Emack and Bolios in the hotel. There was complimentary coffee in the rooms. The park was practically empty except for the WWOHP. We had no waits for any rides at IOA except the Harry ones and getting there at 8 am before the park officially opened meant that we encountered no waits there as well (except for Olivanders). Waits for the rides at US were longer but the express pass meant that we simply walked on. No waiting! It allowed us to go on whatever we wanted then allowed us to have several hours at the pool each day. Something we could not have done if we had to wait for each ride. The proximity of the hotel to the parks is great. We never waited for the boat. We took a rickshaw once (the kids loved this). We scheduled Mears transportation to take us from the airport to the hotel and back again. They offer a shuttle or a private SUV. The private was cheaper for 5 ($111.11). It was well worth it.

We booked a pool view room, and while it was very nice, I don't think it was necessarily worth the extra money. If you manage to get a special deal, then go for it, but the view wasn't great - in fact the window took up less than half the wall - even though the curtain covered the length of the entire wall (giving the impression when you first arrive that the window is huge). The room was a good size, with plenty of room, and 2 queen size beds. The bathroom was quite old and dated, but that's something we've found with a lot of US hotels... The service at check in was great and the concierge helped out with tickets to Universal Studios (bear in mind though, that you can't purchase tickets to any of the Disney parks there). Universal Studios was amazing, and the location of the Hard Rock to these parks is unbeatable. The shuttle boat was great, but it's only a 5 minute walk, if you don't time your arrival at the dock with the boat. The best thing about staying at the Hard Rock is the Fast/Express pass you have on 90% of the rides at the two parks. This saves so much time, it's difficult to calculate just how much. There were rides that had 100s of people in line, with a listed wait of 50 minutes, yet we were able to literally walk straight on without waiting at all - simply by showing our room cards. If you go with a family, it is definitely worth the extra money of staying at the Hard Rock, just for the feature of not having to wait. Although this fast access doesn't apply to the Harry Potter attractions, guests are allowed into the park at 8am, before the general public, so there's not much of a wait anyway - and even though we're not Harry Potter fans, it's worth the wait! The facilities at the Hard Rock are of an extremely high standard - the restaurants are fabulous, the pool was lovely and the service was great. Because we didn't waste time waiting in queues at the parks, we were able to spend a lot of time in the afternoons lazing by the pool, with a few drinks from the bar (you don't have to leave your lounge - the staff are constantly wandering around, asking if you want/need anything). The pool was great - music playing underwater, waterslide and movies played every night. Although there have been other comments about the lack of a 7/11 or convenience stores nearby, you can purchase small items from either the Hard Rock shop or the ice cream parlour downstairs - and the prices really aren't bad. The proximity to the restaurants and bars at the Universal area was also fantastic - so many choices and great options. And the atmosphere there was great - safe and fun for families of all ages. Also, be aware that if you don't have a hire car, it costs over $50 one way to the Disney parks, and you may have a loooong wait at the airport to get a taxi to the hotel. We arrived on a flight from Miami, which was only 35 minutes in duration, yet we waited for a taxi for an hour. We travel a lot, for both business and personal trips, and we've NEVER arrived at an airport where there isn't a mass of taxis waiting to collect passengers. There were only 10 people in the line in front of us, yet it took an hour for us to get a taxi - not good enough for a city that relies so heavily on tourism. The shuttle bus wasn't much better - 15 min wait to buy a ticket, with at least a 40 minute wait for an available bus.

We had cocktails by the bar and even though the gratuity is added into the bill we received very good service from our waitress. The music/Band was fair.

Each year we stayed in October. FOOD: Club food at the Portifino was far and away better than the other two resorts. Club was well worth the price, with both breakfeast and 5:00 food being of high quality. Dinner was beef, chicken skewers, and antipastas. Late night sweats were actual desserts. We never had to eat anywhere else. Royal Pacific had a great breakfeast, but the nighttime food was questionable. Had creative looking asian \"casseroles\" that our kids wouldn't touch. Cookies and milk at night. Hard Rock had lower quality breakfeast, and nighttime food was little more than chicken wings, egg rolls, or chicken dumplings. Cookies and milk at night. Hard Rock was way overcrowded, and we always had to wait in line. CLUB LEVEL ROOM: Our favorite was the Royal Pacific. Was never crowded or loud, and we used it much like a living room. Wej ust hung out in there reading..internet surfing, or watching the big screen tvs. It was really an extention of your hotel room. Portifino's club room was large, but a litte sterile. Hard Rock's club room was way too small, always crowded, and music was too loud to do anything but eat.. CLUB LEVEL FLOOR: Royal Pacific and Hard Rock were about the same, and, well, Portifino didn't have one. At the Royal Pacific, it never seemed crowded, and you did feel like you were on a private floor. Hard Rock seemed to always be crowded and cramped. Also, noticed a lot of people walking around the floor that didn't seem to be staying on the floor. Overall, Royal Pacific had the best club level experience. If we stayed at the Portifino again, we would pay the extra money for the club level.

You cut out through the pool entrance and its a five minute walk to citywalk. * With room key you go to the front of line on most attractions and rides. This is key. The park was not busy at this time of year and we literally walked right on to rides without waiting one minute. When it is hot out, this is worth every penny you pay for the hotel * We stayed in a kids suite this time. One huge room with king size bed for parents, one smaller room with twin beds and tv for kids. One bathroom with toilet and bathtub and separate bathroom with 2 sinks and shower. Really a nice treat * Great pool with live bands, activities and huge slide * food choices are great here. The palm steak house (pricey but always great), the kitchen (delish!) and a self serve coffee, ice cream place to grab a bagel or muffin as you are running to make it to the park early for Harry Potter! * We ordered room service one night after my youngest soon was pooped out from the parks and it was also very good. * We had a problem in our room and the management team could not have handled it better. Cons: Property is getting old. Hallways look aged but rooms are still okay. It is pricey....If you want a bargain, don't stay here. Besides the fact that on the weekends the rooms are no bargain (especially in orlando where there are tons of rooms and you can get great deals most of the year) Valet parking is around $25 a day, internet is $10 a day, $25 for a rollaway bed, $13 bucks for a fruity drink by the pool, bottled water in sundry store is $4 a pop, and so on .... I expect to pay it at a resort but if you are on a budget, etc, you can stay somewhere else for much less. Bell service and valet parking seemed understaffed. Called for bellman and no one showed up after 15 minutes so we just carried it down ourselves. Took quite some time for valet to pull around the car (for $25 it should be much faster!) Perhaps they were understaffed that day and this is not a continuous problem. More importantly, I was told by a staff member that the hotel is having water leakage in many room when it rains. It could be a problem so check your room when you check in. All in all, the hard rock is a fun, lively hotel. The kids die for it. The not waiting in line for the rides makes everyone happy. It is pricey but it is a resort and the pool area is definitely a great free activity (if you avoid those fruity drinks!). If you are trying to make your trip to Universal special, I'd definitely stay here (or any of the lowes at universal property) If you are not heading to universal or islands of adventure, stay at Gaylord palms or the ritz.

We upgraded to the club level (+$75 a night...was told that it is usually +$100 per night). Well worth it as we took advantage of the breakfast, snacks, drinks, and sweets. The room was super clean and well appointed. The pool was fun and very relaxing after a long day at the parks. We did the valet parking - it was more expensive, but I'm on VACATION! Check in/out was a breeze, staff was helpful and friendly. Our remote control died and I mentioned it to a housekeeping staff in the hallway as we were leaving to the parks - she got on her walkie-talkie right there and got maintenance to take care of it. We did the luau at the Royal Pacific resort and it was a good deal. The food and drinks were good and the entertainment was as well. We went to see Blue Man Group and it was a blast!

Each hotel offers the guests the best options in the Orlando area in terms of being able to easily walk to the Parks or take a frequent short boat ride, and the best perk is the front of the line pass. For families with teens and old rockers, we feel that the Hard Rock does it best ...that was until this past weekend. My husband had a meeting at the Portafino Bay hotel and we chose to stay at the Hard Rock due to its atmosphere, the swimming pool and its theming. During this stay, we arrived very late and was assigned room 5044. Check in was efficient although the \"Hard Rock All Access Card\" was barely acknowledged. We never received any of the perks so those of you who are considering this card, so don't waste your money. Our room overlooked a roof with a bunch of wires. This is not an issue for us but might be important to others. As we arrived very late, we put out the \"Do not disturb\" sign. During the early morning from 7am on, we heard constant banging and loud, continuous conversations. We were too tired to get out of bed and just thought we had very inconsiderate neighbors of a large group. My daughters and I enjoyed the new Harry Potter section of Islands of Adventure. (The perk of early morning entry is one not to be missed by hotel guests. ) That evening we returned to our room and we noticed that the room opposite our room had a broken door jam. The door was not locked. The next morning, it became obvious what it was. Starting the next morning after 7, constant banging of the door and loud conversations awoken us from our sleep again. This time, I wrapped a robe around me and opened the door to face a full housekeeping staff (more than 7 or 8) loading up carts, laughing, screaming for position. The room opposite our room is a storage, staging area for housekeeping. I asked them to lower their voices but nothing could muffle the constant traffic stream of workers gathering in this area for hours on end. We had requested a late check out and received an extension of 90 minutes. Housekeeping came by 3 times between 9-12 knocking on our door to see if we were checking out yet. Each time, I informed them that we had a late check out of 12:30pm After we were starting our day, I called the manager on duty, Nicole [--] and spoke to her. It was one of the most disappointing calls I have ever encountered in deals with hundreds of stays at hotels. I informed her that we had a late check out and were disturbed 3 times even with a \"do not disturb\" was placed on our door. When I pointed out that under no circumstances should they sell a room in that location, her response was \"I am so sorry that you had a disappointing stay\". She failed to recognize this location as problematic and refused to even acknowledge that this must a location that had received complaints before. As we are Florida residents, she did in the end, after I demanded some sort of restitution, offer a return stay of one night at another time, which I have no confirmation and clearly does not compensate for 2 bad nights. If I had not been so exhausted from this conversation and her lake of empathy, I would have tried to go higher up the ladder. Her poor communication and droid like responses have left our family leaving the hotel feeling like the staff doesn't care about any of the guests, their experience and the ruining of the weekend. This manager needs to get additional training in handling customers. I am warning all future guests to be VERY careful what rooms you are given. Go to the room, check out the view (if that is important to you) and look at the rooms around your rooms. Check for housekeeping closets (or hidden rooms in this case) and elevators to disturb your sleep. And most important, if your stay is not up to your standards, speak to someone who can help make a difference.

We were here to see Harry Potter and wanted to be guaranteed entry as we were in Orlando for only 1 day. The hotel is quite stunning. The property is gorgeous and the lobby is beautiful. There are marble floors, a huge seating area with leather arm chairs and sofas that overlooks the pool area through an entire wall of glass and french doors. There is loud rock n roll music that plays in the lobby and in the elevators 24 hrs a day, but you can't hear it in the rooms. We were given a room on the 1st floor facing the pool area. There is music played by the pool from morning until later in the evening and that can be easily heard in our room. There is no outside access from the rooms, no patio or balcony so there are no windows or doors, but you can still hear the music. The room itself is very nice, quite spacious, flat screen tv, comfortable beds, large table and chairs. The only problem during our brief stay was that about 2:30am, apparently some type of alarm was activated. We never found out if it was just our wing or the entire hotel. An announcement came over the speaker in our room that stated, \"Attention guests!an alarm has been activated, please remain calm. Stay near the speaker for further instructions.\" We didn't know what to do. It kept buzzing and repeating the announcement. We looked out in the hallway but there was no one from the hotel around, just other guests also looking out. We all looked at one another, shrugged our shoulders and went back inside our rooms. There was no smoke or odor or hint of an emergency. The announcement repeated itself for approximately 10 min and then stopped. My wife started packing some things in case we had to evacuate. We decided to lay back down and see what happened. Just as we were falling asleep again, the announcement began again. Again we looked out, nothing. There was no further information forthcoming. No more announcements or phone call from the hotel. Nothing. The next morning during check out we asked what happened and the front desk rep said an alarm began to go off randomly and they were investigating the cause. For our inconvenience, they offered us free drink coupons (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) but as we were leaving, we turned them down. We never had the opportunity to eat in the restaurants or swim in the pool, so we can't comment on those. We did take the boat launch from the hotel to IOA and it was quick and efficient. However for those with handicapped travelers or special needs, note that the boat drops you off in City Walk and it is quite a hike from the dock to the park itself. The only other thing of note about our stay is the price for the parking. The hotel charges you 18.00 for self parking. I agree with others that have reviewed here that say for the price point of this hotel, it is ridiculous to charge your guests parking fees. Oh one last thing, when I was bringing the car around for my family, my wife waited near the valet. She observed a family arrive via shuttle and bell services load their bags onto the cart and store their luggage. Well, they neglected one bag and it sat there for quite a while until my wife pointed it out to the valet. Now I realize that the family whose bag it was should have made sure that all their bags were accounted for, it is easy during the excitement of arrival to overlook something. It is definitely bell services responsibility to make sure all bags are accounted for. Anyone could have walked off with their bag! I don't think there is any excuse for that. This hotel was full of international travelers. I believe it is a reflection of the popularity of the Harry Potter world as that is all everyone was talking about, especially the Brits. Overall this is a beautiful hotel. I would recommend it to travelers with children or teenagers or young adults. If it is just a couple such as my wife and I (in our 40's) or seniors, I would recommend somewhere quieter. Also there were no discounted rooms available at the time of our stay.

(3 children, 2 adults) who decided to spend 4 nights at the Hard Rock Hotel Universal Orlando in order to go to Wizarding World of Harry Potter Universal Islands of Adventure. I knew that we needed a suite and that theme park hotels in Orlando are CRAZY expensive ... so i was prepared to pay top dollar. We chose Hard Rock because of its location. It is a 10 minute walk down a beautiful, garden path behind the hotel to the front gate at Universal Studios OR there are constantly running boat taxis (5 minute drive) to Universal Studios/Universal City Walk area). I have been to a few other Hard Rock Hotels before and they are slightly worn & tacky. This one is BEAUTIFUL! A true 4 to 5 star hotel from the exterior facade to the interior lobby to the restaurants, pool area, etc..... Check in was a breeze .... less than 10 minutes. We took the elevator up to the 5th floor and opened the door to our lovely room. We had a Kid's Suite. This consisted of a foyer, then a very large bathroom with separate tub & shower with double sink, then a very large (probabably 18 x 22 ft) living area with a king size bed, fold out couch, dresser & large flat screen TV. Connected to this room was another large bedroom with 2 twin beds, dresser with a flat screen TV & a small kid's dining table with 4 chairs. I think my only 'beef' would be that there is no room for a dining table in the main living room area .... and that presents a bit of a problem when you get room service as you have to sit on the bed or couch to eat. They do kind of nickel and dime you to death a bit ... My youngest (7 years) wanted to stay in the bedroom with her two siblings and so we asked for a roll away bed to be brought up (instead of her sleeping on the pull out couch in our sleeping area) .... We were told that the roll away bed would be $25/a day to rent .... I WAS FLABBERGASTED to say the least. For the amount of money being paid at this hotel per night .... that was ridiculous to me. All in all we were incredibly happy with our stay at this hotel.

I love this Hotel, which maybe a little pricey compared to lots of others in Orlando, But for those wanting a little luxury or to feel like a star, they have a policy at the Hotel to do exactly that. The Hotel is prestine, and beautifully designed as are the grounds which are very well maintained. The rooms are larger than the average room and decorated with memoribila of rock legeds ie The Beatles.The Pool is stunning and has everything from underwater music, a water slide, a fully serviced outside bar/ reastaurant with waiter service to your lounger so you never have to leave. Here you will get lots of entertainment for adults and kids like Live Music, Hoola competitions etc, surrounded by lushious palms and even sand all very tropical They have an excellent restaurant there called The Kitchen (even if we are not staying at the Hard Rock will still go there to eat) Theres a late night bar The Velvet Lounge, and an Emack and Bolios Ice Creams for the Kids.The BEST reason to stay at this hotel is this, you can use your room key as a fast pass in Universal and Islands of Adventure it is fantastic and worth every penny for that alone No Queing,get straight on your favourite rides!. This is one of three hotels at Universal they are owned by Leows all of them themed and in my opinion prob some of the very best in Orlando believe me I have stayed in many. For those who think its in the pricier bracket but would love to stay heres a tip on a 2 week family vacation with the family it could cost a small fortune as my family has grown its become less affordable, but if you happen to find a more reasonable place to stay you could treat yourself and stay 1 or 2 nights here ie at the end of your stay and get full use out of the parks with the room key acting as your fast pass on those days. My only negative would be car parking charges or valet as you can have either but there is no free parking remember to factor that in when planning. But you don't always need to use your car as the hotel has a boat dock where you can travel free to and from city walk and The Universal Parks. Its definately a favourite place to stay in Florida and lots of fun for Adults and children.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quito, Ecuador", "Title": "\u201cWalking distance to The Incredible Hulk and no lines!

Room service for breakfast or 2-am cocktails, they are always willing to give you the best service.

It is very much a family hotel (with dogs) - loud, fun and not relaxing and I am sure many will find that appealing. What I did not like was the amount of bugs around - both in and near the pool and in my room (a king suite - sold as a junior suite but to be honest no bigger than a regular marriott hotel room and much smaller than an Embassy Suites suite/room but it is not expensive). Dogs barking at night was an issue and speaking to other guests they found that too however front desk staff seemed genuinely concerened and did try to find out their owners. Beds very cncomfortable and due to the ambient noise very difficult to get quality sleep. I hate being so negative but it just wasnt a hotel I could recommend to firinds that like me require quality and a peaceful trip - however for young couple with kids then great as long as the cleanliness improves.

Originally we booked a rental car for the whole week, but later decided we would just use the water taxis at the resort. Overall, this felt like a resort. Our trip was for one full week, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The positive thing about this hotel is that everyone was really friendly. We got there at noon, but the rooms were not going to be ready until 3, which I knew from the website. No biggie, they immediately printed out our room keys which are also used as express passes for the theme parks, and they stored our bags until our room was ready. Once in our room, it was really clean, the maids were nice, and the other families at the hotel were all friendly and personable. I went to the pool on two separate occasions and found it to be really full (of course, it's the first week of July), but not overrun with too many unsupervised kids, or rowdy drunk adults. The pool had music playing, there is a cool waterslide, and ping pong tables. For an additional fee you can rent a cabana that has a flat screen TV, but it was just me, so I didn't need that. I read on another review that they thought the pool was dirty, but keep in mind that it did rain briefly every day I was there, so of course, there were some leaves and branches down, but not for long. At night they were showing Harry Potter movies at the pool, which was really cool. Also, the beds were so comfortable. They have down pillows and blanket, which was heavenly, especially after all the walking at the parks. Also, there is a clothes line in the shower that allows you to pull out and put back on your own. After swimming, I was able to rinse the chlorine off my suite and hand dry it before packing it away. Here are the negative things I do have to say. First off, the store on the pool level has coffee, drinks, ice cream and other goodies, but believes me, they are expensive. I bought 2 16 oz diet cokes, 3 snack size bags of chips, and a16 oz. bottled water and it was $16.50. This would cost you no more than $5.00 at any other store. There are mini fridges in the room with snacks, but if you eat from that, they will charge you. Fiji water in the room will cost you $7.00. The other negative thing is that we decided against the rental car because the website says that it is a $15.00 per night charge to park. When we got there, they have a sign posted that it is $22.00 a night. That is ridiculous. They also charged a little over $20.00 for a 3 day pass to use the gym. Overall, I do think that these things should be included in the price of paying for your hotel stay. I really feel like they are squeezing every dime they can out of their guests. My advice if you are going to use the gym, bring your sports bottle from the theme park and fill it up as many times as you would like. The gym offers free (imagine that) ice water with lemon, and also has fresh fruit. Also, take a few pieces of fruit back to your room for later. A few days at a theme park makes you crave a nice banana and apple. I did decide to rent a car for one day, which was very easy to do. The Hertz car rental has a station set up right at the front desk. We rented the car and got away for the day, but we also stopped by Wal-Mart up the street and stocked up on Gatorades, water, and other snacks for the room. We just couldn't afford to stay hydrated at these hotels prices. Bottom line, I saved for this trip, and I knew what we were in for. If you are coming to the resort for a family vacation, just be prepared, and know that you are going to be paying more than you would at your average place, but then again, it is also a lot more fun than staying at home.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cE coli food poisoning\u201d", "Author": "jcook3", "ReviewID": "UR70539318", "Content": "As if paying $11 for a mixed drink, $13/day for parking, and having to listen to horrible bands at the pool wasn't terrible enough, add food poisoning.

Staff were very polite and accomodating. Pool is nice, a bit on the \"shallow side\" no deeper than 4 feet which is good for the kids. Water slide at the pool is fun too. There was a DJ there who also got the crowd to play games and have contests. The room was a bit smaller than I had hoped. We had just a standard garden view, but it was clean and adequate. Maid service was excellent as room was always made up by the time we got back from the parks in the evening. Carpet in the hallways(at least on the 5th floor) seemed a bit worn and the laundry room was a bit unkept, but I guess that is being nit-picky. The express pass to bypass the lines at the parks was great! I felt like I was getting away with something just walking onto the rides or maybe waiting 10 minutes at most. Unfortunately they can't be used for Harry Potter's Forbidden Journey (Islands of Adventure) and the newest roller coaster (Universal Studios). We did take advantage of going to the park 1 hour early for hotel guests before the public is admitted. We waited for the Harry Potter ride maybe 5 to 10 minutes at most and rode it 3 times before 8:20am. That alone was worth the price of the hotel as I had heard horror stories of people waiting hours for the ride. One side note about the Harry Potter section of Islands of Adventure. If you are looking to get your kids into Ollivander's Wand shop, think twice. My kids really wanted wands and to have the \"experience\" of the wand choosing them. When we found the wand shop the line was 1 hour and 40 minutes long. The employee at the end of the line told us that only 20 people are admitted at a time and only 1 of the 20 get chosen for the \"wand experience\". Needless to say, we didn't do it. My kids were a bit disappointed but they moved on. I think maybe Universal could have come up with a better way to do that so that everyone gets a chance. Anyway, back on subject of the hotel. It was very cool with alot of rock and roll memorabelia, clean, great staff etc .....a bit pricey but as I said, that was worth it to bypass the lines and ride the Harry Potter ride so quickly.

Spent the first evening at Islands of Adventure on all our favourite rides again - can't miss Hulk, Spiderman, Dudley Do Right, JP, Bilge-Rat Barges, Fire & Ice. Next two days spent at Un. Studios, then at Islands again. Thoroughly recommend Rip Ride Rockit, the Mummy, Simpsons for the more adventurous, as well as the Horror Make Up show for a real laugh and breather from the heat. Breakfasts either in the kitchen - go for the buffet if you are having juice and coffee anyway, or a muffin and banana from the coffee shop. Room coffee machines very nice too. I also recommend the Kitchen for evening meals, but don't fill up on the delicious cheesy bread because the portions are enormous. Incredibly friendly wait staff, especially Emily. Never ate at the beach club, although one lazy afternoon lying by the pool I watched a parade of enormous looking dishes and frozen drinks going past. Pool wait service is also really friendly. Watch out for the Hurricane cocktails, they are lethal. Evenings spent with cocktails, wrapped up in warm towels watching a dive in movie always fun. Didn't go in the pool or hot tubs this time, but remember them being great. Free boat service to City Walk prompt and friendly as ever, but no longer between hotels, only direct to City Walk and back so any trips over to the Portofino (recommend eating at Mama Della's) or the Royal Pacific require a bike taxi or a City Walk stop off. If you get a chance ask the concierge for a guide to all the rock/pop memorabilia in the hotel, they can provide you with a print out that shows the location and histoy of everything. Would absolutely recommend this hotel for anybody wanting to visit Universal Studios or Seaworld, the front of line access is invaluable, and means you can ride several times in a row quickly. The only main rides not currently accepting this are the Rip Ride Rocket and Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and I recommend using the single riders queue for both of these to get on 10 times faster. There is no better feeling than racing past the normal queue. In conclusion this hotel is so cool even the fountains wear sunglasses.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, MO", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel to enjoy Universal Studios\u201d", "Author": "KearneyTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR67540584", "Content": "This year we chose the right hotel at Universal - Hard Rock! Last time we stayed at Portofino, which is great but not really teen friendly. We stayed in concierge rooms and everything was awesome. I don't think the rooms are any different from the regular rooms, you just get access to the concierge lounge for complimentary food and drinks. We did get connecting rooms but I called several months in advance to request them when I made the reservation. I was told that the best bet for connecting rooms is to ask for both rooms with 2 queens. For breakfast it was pretty standard continental breakfast- bagels, rolls, fruit, etc. The evening cocktail time was GREAT with hot appetizers and beer and wine. One night we had Mexican theme with nachos and southwest egg rolls as well as veggies, salad and cheese plates. The next night was American night with really good chicken wings (add your own sauce so they were kid friendly) and mini corn dogs. They have a sign that says 2 drinks per person but we found out that meant for each time you visit the bar - you can drink all that you like. Honestly we ate our dinner in the lounge each night. The hotel has a great pool and is so close to walk to the parks. Also, if you stay here you get Express passes with your room charge to bypass the ride lines. The week we stayed, the new Harry Potter was not open to the general public- but as guests at Hard Rock we got to experience the area (and it was awesome!!)

It was also VERY clean. This is another biggie for me...I had one bad experience in a MD hotel and always check the sheets and bathroom before I settle in. Anyway, this room was impeccable. It wasn't a very big room, but just what the two of us needed after a night of dancing. We ordered a room service pizza, and it was delicious, and quick:) A MAJOR plus was the location to City Walk. It was a short (maybe 5 minute, if that) walk to the main attractions. It was well lit and meandered through a garden next to a little river/stream. The pool looked impressive from a distance, but I didn't have time to check it out in person.

We did have a few little grumbles during our stay but these were sorted out to our satisfaction although perhaps they could have been avoided. We arrived at the Hotel by coach and as a result, we were dropped off at the side by the valet car parking area which is some distance from the main reception. It was a bit of a struggle and we were disappointed that when we reached the entrance, none of the bell staff appeared to have the slightest interest in offering us any assistance! Check-in itself however was an absolute breeze. We were dealt with extremely efficiently by a very professional agent who supplied us with all the relevant information about the Hotel and genuinely appeared only too happy to answer the many questions I posed. Usually check in staff at Hotels are like robots and see customers as an inconvenience so his approach was really refreshing and very much appreciated. We made the way to our room which was on the 5th floor and sadly we had been allocated a room which was at the furthest point from the elevator which was annoying so in retrospect, I wish I had approached the disinterested bell staff!! The room itself was nice- being clean and comfortable with nice furnishings and fittings. It contained a flatscreen tv (with a wide choice of channels and pay movies), a cd player, a clock radio with i-phone dock, mini bar, safe (which was very small!), iron and board, and a nice bath with shower and separate sinks with a wide range of toiletries. As is the norm, we were supplied with the usual 5 hangers for 2 people for a weeks stay so we took the opportunity of asking a nearby housekeeper for more hangers. Unfortunately she spoke very limited english and summoned a friend who spoke even less english than she did. Another housekeeper was then called and after appearing to understand our request, knocked on our door 5 minutes later and told us to ring Housekeeping for the extra hangers which really was annoying and frustrating. We made the call and were brought an extra 6 hangers about 20 minutes later by the same person we had asked initially!!! We then had a look round the Hotel and were really impressed with all the services on offer. The pool area was really elegant with a wide range of areas to sit and relax which were spotlessly clean and inviting. It is sad that we spent such little time at the Hotel so did not use any of these excellent facilities. Whilst at the Hotel, we utilised the concierge on numerous occasions which on the whole was excellent although a couple of the staff appeared a little disinterested. A special mention to John however who was a consumate professional - an expert in his field who gave us loads of help and assistance and was dedicated to ensuring we got the most out of our stay in Orlando. We really liked Universal and the fast pass entrance with our room key to most of the rides was great although the parks were not really that busy. The river taxi from the Hotel was enjoyable as was the walk through the gardens to the parks. Again, with our busy schedule, we only spent one day at Universal/Islands of Adventure so in future we may opt to choose a Disney Resort Hotel purely because we spent the remaining time at the Disney attractions. On one particular day, we left the Hotel at 7am and returned at 11.30pm to find that our room had not been serviced at all which was very annoying and just not good enough. We rang Housekeeping and were advised that someone would service the room. In the interim, we waited in the reception area as we were both really tired after such a long day! I approached reception to make a formal complaint and whilst my concerns were dealt with, the guy who was dealing with it seemed very \"un-phased\" about it - almost like it was a regular thing. I told him I was still not satisfied and he gave me 2 vouchers for a free breakfast buffet which was appreciated but I felt they were only given as a last resort. When we returned to the room it had been \"serviced\" but to a very poor standard. The bins had not been emptied and the room was untidy and dusty but on reflection, speed was probably the key to addressing the problem. Whilst on the subject of housekeeping, I left notes regarding the broken lock on the minibar, the bulb on the bedside light needing replacement and the water being lukewarm most of the time but they were just ignored which again was disappointing. We were also frustrated that the mini-bar was only serviced once throughout our entire stay despite us requesting it! I suppose this is a good thing really as the price of all mini-bar items is rather excessive! The following morning was another early start so I took the opportunity of asking at reception for someone to check the room was serviced. The lady was very professional being sincerely apologetic for the inconvenience and genuinely concerned that the event had even occurred. It is worth mentioning that most of the staff are relatively young and one wonders how equipped they are in terms of experience/maturity to deal with any serious compalints! We ate dinner at the Hotel's restaurant \"The Kitchen\" which was good although nothing outstanding. The food itself was good and the service was reasonable although sometimes we feel that staff think the Brits do not know how to tip and as a result give a second rate service. This however was not true at \"The Palm\" restaurant were the service was absolutely outstanding and totally first class. Although the service was superb, we were not overly impressed with the food on this occasion which we thought was over-priced and nothing special. The complimentary breakfast we received (at \"The Kitchen\") was really nice and the service too was excellent - it is sad that we only chose to take breakfast on our last day as we may have considered taking breakfast every day had we known how good it was. On leaving the Hotel, the checkout process was very efficient and highly professional. On balance the Hotel was very good although there were a few frustrations along the way that with a little more attention to detail could be rectified with great ease. I would definitely recommend this Hotel although if you intend to do all the Disney parks, it is quite a distance away and in my opinion Downtown Disney has much more to offer than Universal's City Walk. A special mention about Mears Transport - they were absolutely fantastic and we would have been lost without them. Always on time, always with very courteous and helpful drivers and excellent customer service at all times - 10 out of 10 for Mears!", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tonbridge, Kent", "Title": "\u201cUniversal Approval From Our Family of Five\u201d", "Author": "mikepdews", "ReviewID": "UR65793284", "Content": "Having been talked into a flight of over 8 hours (sorry I really hate flying) as it was my partners 40th birthday request (\"no big parties please just take me and the kids to Disney\") we decided on the Hard Rock as our hotel of choice.

However, there was a layer of dust on the furniture in our room on arrival and I can't say we were over impressed with room service throughout our stay. A caricature picture my daughter had specially drawn somehow managed to get all screwed up by maid service. The other feature of this hotel is its great proximity to the Universal theme parks and the fact that you get fast track access at Universal which is a great perk and a real must if you go in the school holidays. This will spoil you though when you venture to Disney and beware Universal is some way from Disney - if you don't hire a car (we didn't) then it's a $40 cab ride each way. There is a boat that takes you to Universal from the hotel grounds although you can also walk it in around 5 minutes as well. The only negative aspects of this hotel in our opinion are breakfast is quite pricey for a family of 5 (great selection mind you) and our 15 year old was granted adult status here (always amazes me that kids can't vote, drink etc but they are classed as adults by travel companies//hotels from around the age of 11!) and the concierge obviously has an agreement with the cab firms as when we asked how to get somewhere via the Lynx bus we were given the most awkward route possible, probably in the hope that we wouldn't use the bus again. The hotel also operates a shuttle service bus (once daily and you need to get in quickly as it only holds 70 people) to Seaworld, Aquatica and Wet N Wild which we used regularly. The last thing to mention is that Americans do frequent the hotel at weekends and most come for special occasions like birthdays, hen and stag parties and we were all kept awake one Saturday night by a particularly raucous bunch.

Evening room service food was horrible...food arrived only lukewarm. Mini bar prices are outrageous. Limited restaurants--only one hotel restaurant, The Kitchen and then The Palm. I don't count the poolside eatery as a restaurant. Food was average--I'm from NYC so I have high expectations when it comes to food. Not a lot of healthy choices either. Service was so-so until I actually complained, then they livened up a bit. There is no general sundry store to buy simple toiletry items such as toothpaste, Advil/Tylenol, etc. The big plus is that it is a 5 minute walk to the Universal Parks with Express Pass use with your hotel key. Other pluses were nice pool layout, nice slide for kids, decent poolside wait service (they want you to drink!), evening poolside entertainment, general ambience of the hotel/lively vibe. If you want a quiet vacation DON'T go to Hard Rock. And if you're looking for an immaculate clean room don't go to Hard Rock.

Express tix a must; even on the cold breezy days we visited, there were long lines on every attraction. . With our hotel key, we never waited more than 10 min and saw all the attractions at both studios in one day (9am to 6pm) each. We had a deluxe room with 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa. Room clean and spacious with sink strategically outside the WC. Very nice pool which the kids used as it was heated to 88 degrees. Problems: no housekeeping day 1 (we callled for maid service), poor sink lighting; broken toilet handle (my husband \"fixed\" it twice); no soda machines (expensive in on-site market that closed by 9 pm), expensive internet, and poor signage....we wandered a bit to find pathway to universal, pool towels, etc). Unable to do auto check out on tv as server \"overloaded\". The staff, however, was very friendly and The Kitchen restaurant meal was good but pricey (hint: portions huge; we could have fed 5 with 3 entrees).

Breakfast was expensive and not brilliant so maybe try it out one day and go elsewhere for the rest of your stay. The pool area was lovely, the pool bar really nice but didn't spend that much time there. The Velvet bar in the hotel was also a great place to chill, must say that on first night the hotel was holding it's monthly rock concert (velvet sessions) and we weren't allowed to enter the bar, had a bit of a moan to the manager and was lead straight in. We were really grateful and must say thank you to the desk manager (didn't get her name) for sorting this out for us. The hotel is part of the Universal complex and you can simply walk to the parks in 5 minutes and also to the City Walk nightlife area. The parks were surprisingly dated, particularly the original park. They were quite empty so didn't have to queue for the rides which was a massive bonus. I also think it's about time to change the Jaws boat ride, it is rubbish! Went to Emerils one evening, a supposed decent restaurant in City Walk, we had the tasting menu, it was overpriced and not very good. Go to Hard Rock Cafe instead, much better value for money. The hotel's fantastic location to Universal means its location to Disney isn't great and as we weren't driving didn't bother going this time, hopefully will get back soon. We did go to Sea World, again quite empty so didn't have to queue for the two fantastic roller coasters, two of my favourite in Orlando. Obviously went to see Shamu, so hearing the shocking news of the death of Dawn Brancheau was awful. We saw her in the show just two weeks ago. I'm sure the show will go on though. Whether you agree with holding these truly magnificent animals in captivity, or not, it is very special to just get the chance to see them. Also went to Busch gardens. An organised coach picked us up at Unversal and it took about 1.5 hours to get there. Once again, it was quiet so no queues. The tigers were a highlight as was the ride called Sheikra. If you like shopping there's a fantastic outlet called Orlando Premium Outlets, the last stop on the I-Drive trolley bus, got loads of stuff from Diesel, Levi, Armani and DKNY with a 75% reduction.

I suspected that many times teens were hanging out at the elevators, waiting for someone to go to the 7th floor and then partaking in the \"goodies\" that they had not paid for. The pool was heated (thankfully as it was unseasonably cool) and our boys really enjoyed it. The only weak link seemed to be housekeeping.

We are not high maintenance travelers, but we do expect good service when we pay for it. At $300 a night, we would have expected our room cleaned everyday and supplies for coffee and tea refilled. Nearly every day we had to \"raid\" the house keeping carts for supplies (carts that never seemed to leave the hallway). Every day we saw leftover room service trays in the hallway that stayed in the hallway for 12 hours at a time (one we saw sit there for two days). After four days of this sub-par service, we expressed concerns to hotel management. We were given a free breakfast coupon and were told the problem would be resolve. While we enjoyed our free breakfast, nothing on the house keeping side was fixed. We continued two more days with the bad service (we thought we would give them a two day grace period). Unfortunately, we had to complain again (and we hate complaining on vacation). We again received coupons for free breakfast and a bottle of wine (although they took the wine glasses from our room before we got to drink the wine).

The concierge desk in particular was very helpful for us. We had to book shuttles to go to Disney World, this was provided by Mears Transportation and was $18 round trip per person. The hotel has free shuttles to Seaworld, Aquatica and Wet and wild. There is only 1 departure time at 9.55 am and one pick up time which is around 6pm. We used this to go to aquatica and seaworld and had no problems with it. Coach was clean etc. They have an ice cream parlour and a starbucks on site which we used a couple of times, were reasonably priced considering price of things in the parks. They also have people come into the hotel that do caricatures, these seemed quite expensive when compared with the ones outside. Definitely recommend the one in Universal outside the Simpsons ride. They were fantastic, price was the best I'd seen the whole trip! At night you could either chill in your room, go to the velvet bar on site (which was quite pricey) or there's Citywalk where there are loads of restaurants and bars to have a good time. Again a quick 5 minute walk from the hotel. It's right opposite the parks. Just a warning, when checking out, if you have given them a credit card on file, they will withhold a nights charge on that card. We were unaware that they did this. When checking in, we didn't give a credit card for them to store as we said we would pay for everything in advance. We had a cash passport credit card with the money stored on it, we paid once for the wi fi in the room on this card. Now unbeknown to us they kept this credit card on file, so on check out they with held $220 of the cash on the card. Only realised this when trying to buy gifts and the card was declined. Went back to the hotel to ring the card company to see if any fraud or anything had happened. They told me straight away that the hotel is withholding cash and it could take up to 7 working days to get it back. I asked them how to get it back and was told that the hotel needed to fax them saying that we can have the money back however it can still take 7 working days. So my husband went to speak with the person (that happened to be the manager) to ask them to fax the company and also say that we happy with our stay and thank you very much for the upgrade, but also that we wasn't very happy that we did not know this was going to happen. They apologised and said that when we gave a card in at check in that they should have explained this. We told them that we understand why they do it etc, however we never gave a card in at check in, just to pay for the wi fi in the room. Again she apologised and sent the fax off straight away. She then came back and gave us $100 as compensation so hat we could buy the gifts we wanted to. So just a warning, when they ask for a credit card, give one you aren't going to use for the holiday. Im glad it just happened at the end of the holiday. In terms of value at the hotel, the actual cost of staying there without any deals is quite expensive. We got a fantastic price for the hotel. We would definitely stay here again without a doubt. You certainly will not be disappointed!!", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Savannah, GA", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutly Wonderful\u201d", "Author": "lolasmom08", "ReviewID": "UR53859765", "Content": "Whenever we decide we're going to take a trip to Universal we always stay at least one night at one of the 3 on property hotels.

This hotel is absolutly beautiful. We arrived early - 8 am - and our room was already ready. We were able to get our room keys for 5 (they allow you to sleep 5 in a standard room) and head over the parks. The boat ride from this hotel to Universal is so quick and the walking distance is very short. The biggest plus of staying here is the use of the Express line to hotel guests from the day of your check-in to the day of your check-out. We were able to do every attraction at both parks easily - some of them several times. The rooms were comfortable, clean, and the ammenities are great. We ate breakfast at The Kitchen and it was good - a bit too expensive but what isn't at a theme park area. The pool are was gorgeous but all we got to do was look around. I called during the day from the parks and was told the hotel would be open until 10 but when we went to go at 9 they were closing.

Prices for Concierge rooms were $514 first night and $494 second night - we had two rooms. The club lounge is a total joke and completely inadequate in relation to the cost of the rooms. Breakfast (we always try to catch a breakfast in the club lounge) consisted of some cold muffins, hard bagels, sticky oatmeal and some fruit. The lounge is very small, so not enough seating for everyone. One morning we arrived at 9:45 (breakfast is over at 10:00 ) and there was very little food remaining - we were told there would be no additiional serving. The rooms themselves were fine, nothing wonderful but clean. At this price I suppose I thought they would be a little upgraded; maybe they were but if so, I can't imagine what a regular room would be. Cocktail hour at night - poor quality wine and extremely limited selection of liquor for cocktails. What hors-doerves I saw were ...... well, I just can't remember because there really weren't any! Needless to say we went downstairs to the lobby and bought drinks before dinner. The good points - the staff at this hotel are very friendly, always smiling and saying 'hello\". Their customer service is very good. The pool bar staff was very friendly, coming to stand and talk with us (granted they were not busy because it was cold when we were there!). I imagine they would be very busy in warm weather as the pool area is great - big slide, sandy beach, hot tubs, cabanas for rent, etc.; Going to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure or City Walk is a easy walk just out the back of the hotel. Your room key card is also your \"fast pass express\" for almost all the rides/attractions so no standing in lines (the kids loved it). You can also charge to your room with this same card. All in all, great location, good staff, clean hotel. Just DON'T waste your money to get on the Concierge Floor.

The sweeping driveway, with palm trees and cool guitar fountain made us feel like we had definately chosen the right hotel, right from the start! Yes it is a little on the expensive side but its certainly true that you get what you pay for and this was money well spent! Check-in was quick and smooth, we were a little concerned about the reviews on here that the rooms near to the lift lobby meant a lot of noise at night .In our experience this was only really a concern at weekends when the hotel is busy; which is true of any hotel. Our room was on the 4th floor with views onto the garden at the rear of the hotel; the room was spacious and well equipped, the coffee machine and fridge were useful. The beds and pillows were comfy an the bathroom and towels of good quality. The bathroom is a bit of a tight squeeze in between the door and the w/c.The shower over the tub was good, plenty of hot water. There is a small hand basin in the bathroom and a larger vanity/sink area outside the bathroom which was handy when getting ready in the mornings. The mini bar is of course expensive and they add a 20% gratuity as well! I would suggest stocking up at a local store or at The Hard Rock Gift store or Emack & Bolios they have a range of snacks and drinks at a more reasonable price. Housekeeping was good, there were some days when our room wasnt made up till later in the day but it was always to a good standard. Had a slight issue with the hairdryer but this was sorted immediately by the friendly and attentive housekeeping manager who delivered a brand new one. He regularly checked with us that all was well when he saw us in the corridor and all requests were promptly dealt with. All public areas were tidy, smart and bright, the memorbilia and features are great and the music in the elevators was fun! There are several dining options, The Kitchen where we ate breakfast on a few mornings, this was of a good standard and varied buffet style dining, the breakfast pizza was a hit with my boyfriend! We also ate dinner there a few times and on some evenings they had Characters coming to the tables which was great for children and a fun touch for adults. Prices are of course what you would expect for a 5* hotel. The Palm, a popular American steak house will cost more, we had dinner on the evening of my birthday and had starter, steaks and a nice bottle of wine for $200, pricey but the food was delicous. My boyfriend loved the steak and it was literally melt in the mouth. They also serve food at the Beach Club bar; Burger and fries were a little expensive and the only downside is the automatically add 20% gratuity to all drinks and food. But the setting is lovely and staff friendly. The pool area/gardens are well maintained, beautifully landscaped and very relaxing, the pool isnt very deep but was okay just to take a quick dip and movies by the pool were fun. You can hire a Cabana but this was a little expensive and there were plenty of pool loungers and secluded spots even at busy times. We enjoyed drinks and cocktails at the Velvet Bar just off the lobby; they did special cocktails most evenings and they had an outside balcony area which was lovely to relax on after a busy day at the parks. The staff were friendly and fun, we fund ourselves popping in for drinks before heading our most evenings. The water taxi to CityWalk was great, the Captains were always friendly and there were a couple who would often do a funny little dance or share some local knowledge which added to the fun! It was great the snuggle up on the Water Taxi on the way back from an evening at Citywalk. They ran until 2am and you never had to wait too long at the dock at Citywalk. The garden walk to Universal Studios were lovely with ducks on the lake, took about 8 minutes to walk to Citywalk/Universal Studios, the area still felt safe and security was good even when walking back in the early hours of the morning. The Express Pass was also great when the parks were busy, we never had to wait in line for any of the attractions.The ability to charge all purchases to your room in the Universal resort and have them delivered to your room was great and saved having to carry purchases around. The only issue we had was the parking charge; $14 a day it seems to be a common thing in Orlando Hotels, we only had the car for 10 days and spent the remaining 4 days using the resort. Location is great in walking distance to Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure/Citywalk, 20 minutes to Disney, 10 minutes to Seaworld.

So, even if the hotel had problems (which, it didn't), the express pass would make up for it. No waiting at all, on any of the rides. Saw both parks----including several rides x2, x3, in about 7.5 hours.....and, the parks were packed. Now, onto the hotel. Typical Lowe's property.....stafff very friendly. Services for both guests with families, and guests without. Food is pricy (lunch for the 6 of us was $90...but, the best burger I have ever had). Velvet is a must, after a long day in the park. The pool is just perfect......heated to 80+ degrees, and a cool slide....TVs, music, sandy beach and just fun! The rooms are a little worn out from such heavy use (we had a kids suite).....but, I was still very satisfied. There are much less expensive properties, nearby.

Luckily this was offseason, but if it had been busier it would have been difficult to use the hotubs since they only hold about 6 people each. The free water taxi at the back of the hotel takes you directly to Universal City Walk which was convenient. The pool grounds are beautiful with plenty of spots with both shade and sun. We ate at the restaraunt called the kitchen which was over priced with a very limited lunch menu. Lunch ordered from the pool beach club was good. Also food/drink service at the pool was excellent with friendly staff. I had a standard room with 2 beds facing the pool which was acceptable but not at the 4 star level ( I would say 3 star). The room and hallways appeared a worn out and are in need of some updates. Also the bathroom was very small and it was difficult to open and close the bathroom door since it was very close to the toilet and tub. Also the sink was outside of the bathroom which I do not like and it was only a single. The beds were firm and we were able to sleep well. The high speed internet which I paid for was extremely slow both with both wired and wireless connections. It was almost unusable so beware. Overall I enjoyed the stay at this hotel, but next time I visit Orlando I would try to find a hotel that is at the 4 star level in terms of the room and specifically a better bathroom.

Although going to Disney is a must at least once in your life, once you've done Disney, Universal is in many ways better. If you stay at one of the onsite hotels, your room key is a fast pass on all of the ride lines. You get to skip the crowds on every ride. Also, unlike Disney, there are no buses to catch. At Universal, you only have a short water taxi ride to the parks or a short walk through beautiful gardens. All of the hotels at Universal also have sand beaches at the pools -- so we do not miss going to the beach. Furthermore, all of the onsite hotels have kids areas in their restaurants where the kids can eat and be entertained and the adults can have a quiet dinner alone. This is free except for paying for the kid's meals. The Kitchen restaurant at the Hard Rock has a kid's area with tvs, video games, toys, and they usually have an entertainer on the weekend for the kids. They also put up, on certain nights, \"dive-in\" movies for the kids at the pool. At the pool, they put up a large movie screen with a kid's movie playing at night. The kids love to swim and watch the movie. We have stayed at all three hotels at Universal and they all are great. We have also stayed at Wilderness Lodge and Saratoga Springs at Disney. I enjoyed my hotel experience at Univseral a lot better than at those hotels at Disney. You can also use any of the pools/restaurants at any of the onsite Universal hotels if you stay onsite at Universal. So, we have stayed at the Hard Rock and then gone over to the Royal Pacific for the day to use their kiddie waterpark ship at the pool that sprays out water. Finally, if you buy your tickets to the parks online at the official Universal webiste, you pay the price for one day for unlimited 7 day, 2 park passes with park hopper.

The first two days we encountered many problems: game room took money for broken games, fan in room was broken, no reasonable place to eat at the hotel, no small store where you could purchase small items or soda, dogs barking, and what pushed me to my limit was the two nights when the people in the room next door woke my entire family up from 2:30 - 4:30 am. I was very dissappointed in my vacation at that point and wanted to leave this hotel as fast as I could. However, after our second sleepless night, I went to the front desk and spoke with a WONDERFUL girl named Tina. I expressed my frustrations and she moved my family to the Club Level on the 7th floor. From that point on I experienced a totally different vacation. It was everything that I had hoped for, We had a nice room and access to the \"club\" where there was unlimited beverages, they had a wonderful free continental breakfast, free (2 hour) happy hour with hordevours, and free snacks and drinks throughout the day. There was even a computer and a big screen tv in the club to use. It was heaven and took so much of the frustration of having to go to CityWalk every time you wanted something to eat or drink. You have to use your keycard to get to the 7th floor, so I felt safe letting my kids leave the room and head down to the club by themselves. There were lots of other kids up there and they made wonderful friends. If you are staying at the Hard Rock, the club level is the only way to go. Although I think it costs about $80 more than the regular rooms, it is worth it. You save a fortune everyday on breakfast, beer/win, snack and soda, not to mention the convenience of having everything at your firgertips only a few steps down the hall.

I guess we expected a more modern, newer room then what we had. The bathroom was clean, but seemed a bit dated. This was really our only dissapointment. However, being as tired as we were, we went right to bed. We got up the next morning and enjoyed a great breakfast in the buffet downstairs, and then off to the parks we went. Nothing better then staying right on the resort. We had a choice of either a water taxi, bicycle carriage, or a short 5 minute walk. We opted to walk over to the parks, and it is a nice scenic walk. We were able to buy our passes at the hotel, which saved us about 20 minute of waiting on line at the parks. We bought the 1 day pass for 2 parks, and we were able to finish both parks in one day (No Kids with us). Also, our hotel key served as an express pass wich allowed us to skip all the lines at every ride, this is what really allowed us to finish both parks in one day. We didn't have to wait on any lines. We had dinner at the Hard Rock in the park that night, and walked around City Walk for a while, before calling it the night and turning in. The next morning, we checked out via our television set in the room, and off we were to our cruise out of Port Canaveral.

Breakfast in the Kitchen was probably the best that I have ever had! We ate there twice and didn't mind paying the $20. My biggest gripe was that we rented a car for one day and because I had parked it in their lot for two hours, I was charged the daily lot fee of $22. My rental on the car for the day was only $45! And one note regarding the rental - on site property will only rent hybred cars and that was a real trip to learn how to drive! Thankfully they go out and give you a lesson before you leave with the vehicle!

It is in the middle of it all. But given the price of about $200/night?? I was a little disappointed. The room was pretty clean, but had this sticky spot on the carpet, right in the middle of the floor that I seemed to hit EVERY time I walked through the room...gross! Who knows what it was that was SO sticky it could stop you in your tracks? The decor was kinda nice, room kinda small, view of the parking lot with a patch of grass and trees, okay. The pool rocked...zero grade entry...live music...fun for the kids with the waterslide...never heard the underwater music, though. We stayed for 3 nights...one of the bathroom rugs disappeared on day two...the other on day three...it bothered me to have to stand on bare ceramic tile in the bathroom so I called down and asked for our bathroom rugs to be replaced. They sent bathmats. I asked for the two original comfy white rugs that we originally had...they DID find some and brought them promptly. The remote was missing, too, BIG deal for my husband...they brought one within half an hour...but then we couldn't get the MAJOR networks?? WARNING!!! IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN MAKE SURE TO SET PARENTAL LOCKS... HBO and all kinds of evening shows are available with the push of a button!! BTW...breakfast buffet is AMAZING!!! at the Kitchen Rest. on the 1st floor! ANYTHING you would want for breakfast, good service, etc. but we had VOUCHERS for free breakfast every morning...don't know the actual price.

Loud, chaotic, forced to valet park...not the best time to arrive with a 4 and 6 yr. old! PLUS it costs $15 to self park (per night) or $22 for valet...COMPLETE RIP OFF!! So, to sum things up...we were there on a FREE all inclusive trip through my husbands company with our 4 and 6 yr. old. The location is INCREDIBLE...but the rest...just adequate. I would have come away feeling disappointed if I had spent the regular price of $200/night for a room that we spent VERY little time in, and was just mediocre.

There's also a nice little gift shop selling Hard Rock clothing and gifts as well as some other clothing brands (at suprisingly reasonable prices). The shop also sells essential items such as soft drinks, bottle openers and painkillers. Our room was fine, nothing much to write home about but it was a decent size and immaculate. The flat screen tv was a nice touch (having HBO was even better!) and the Keurig coffee was very nice. Some reviews have mentioned a noise problem at the hotel, we had no problems at all with this; we stayed on the 5th floor overlooking the pool and 95% of the time, while we were in the room, we could have been the only people in the hotel it was so quiet. The pool area was fabulous. On week days it was quiet with no queues for the slide but it was packed on Saturday afternoon. As some other reviews have pointed out, you can't really swim in the pool as it's only 4ft 6ins at it's deepest point, but then it's a 'fun' area, not a fitness one. There is an adults only spa pool (as well as one for all ages) unfortunately, we found the water just a little too hot to stay in for more than a couple of minutes! Loved the slide, the volleyball court and the 'beach'. The underwater sound system worked brilliantly - sometimes you could actually hear the music better underwater than over. We missed the dive-in movies but did manage to catch some live music around the pool, which was very pleasant and not too loud or overbearing. Drinks from the beach club were fairly pricey when compared with UK prices, at $21.95 for two beers, but this seemed to be fairly average around Orlando and included an 18% gratuity. The service from the bar staff was excellent - there's nothing quite like lying in the pool on a baking hot day and having a friendly face delivering you ice cold drinks at regular intervals! We travelled as a group of adults - I know that some 'adults only' parties have complained about loud and out of control children at the hotel; maybe we were just lucky but we didn't notice this at all. There were lots of children around the pool at the weekend and they made normal levels of 'kid noise' but I really don't see children playing as a problem. The hotel grounds were my favourite aspect of the whole place. Lush, perfectly maintained and teeming with wildlife (lizards, squirrels, butterflies and birds) the five minute walk to the parks was an absolute pleasure. When wandering the gardens, it's so peaceful that it's very easy to forget that you're so close to thousands of tourists. There is a free water taxi from the hotel to City Walk. These run about every 20 minutes and are a very pleasant way to travel athough it's probably quicker for most people to walk instead. All hotel guests can use their room keys to pay for food, drink and shopping in the parks and at City Walk - this is great as it means you don't have to carry cash or credit cards around with you. More importantly, your room key also acts as a free, unlimited fast pass into all the rides and shows throughout your stay - this undoubtedly saved us hours of queueing in sizzling hot temperatures and meant we were able to pack so much more into our days. It's almost worth staying at a resort hotel just for this! I can't comment on the hotel restaurants as we didn't use them (too much choice elsewhere!). The only real downside was that we didn't have a car. When we'd been to Orlando previously, we had only had a car for part of our stay but didn't have any problems as we were at an I-Drive hotel with easy access to the I-Ride trolley and free hotel shuttles to all the parks. As Universal is a fair distance away from I-Drive, we ended up paying quite a lot for taxis (the heat made it almost unbearable to walk most of the time). Although we didn't go to Disney, if we'd wanted to we obvoiusly wouldn't have had the advantage of the free Disney shuttles operated by many of the non-Universal hotels. Although Hard Rock charges $16 a day for parking, I'd say it's worth paying for the convenience of being able to travel where and when you please.

Believe it or not this hotel is very suitable for children! Staff are very helpful, friendly and professional If you stay at a universal hotel your room card gets you to the front of the line at all the theme park rides. This is invaluable. Please note entry to the parks is not normally inclulded in the room price BAD Many of the rooms are adjoining by a flimsy door that does little to keep the sounds out from your neighbours rooms. One night I could hear a woman having a very pleasant stay. Another night a lot of children appeared to be having a squaling party. Another night I actually had to phone security and complain when a guest decided to practice his guitar playing very loudly at 2am waking up both my wife and I. I complained the next day to the management who somehow ensured it did not happen again. The pool - Very pretty but is not much more than 3 feet deep anywhere, great for young children but virtually useless for anyone above 5 feet tall. We normally stay at the royal pacific, and very slightly prefer the RP, but I was really impressed with the Hard Rock and would recommend it. I have also stayed in many other local hotels, including Disney's Port Orleans and motel 6's Quality Inn plaza etc. You should expect the likes of RP and Hard Rock to be better than these cheaper hotels, and you would not be dissapointed.

Luckily we didn't have to use this service, we arrived at 12:30 pm and they were all ready for us. We were in a party of 13 with three rooms and they made sure that we had two rooms connecting and our third room was right across the hall. The staff went above and beyond our expectations, pampering us at every turn. In the late afternoon there was a typical Florida thunderstorm and when we went back to the hotel from the parks there was someone waiting at the entrance to give us towels to dry off. They have restaraunts onsite, as well as several at City Walk. The kids ordered pizza from room service which arrived quickly and was delicious. There are paths that lead directly to the entrance of Universal and it only takes about 5 minutes to walk and they also have rickshaw drivers to pick you up and drop you off and all you need to pay them is a reasonable tip. They also have free water taxis that take you directly to City Walk that run about every 10 to 15 minuttes. By far the most wonderful thing about our rooms were the Fast Pass priviliges you get with your room keys. This alone was worth the extra money we paid for the hotel room. When we priced them at the park out of curiousity we found that having that privilige makes the room very reasonable. Not only can you use them at both parks, they are unlimited, unlike the ones you purchase at the parks which can only be used to ride the rides once and are only good for one day.

The longest line we stood in was 20 minutes and that was for the front seat of a roller coaster, the typical wait was at the most 10 minutes and we didn't have to many waits that long. You also have the luxury of shopping while on site and just showing your room key to the clerk to have your packages sent directly to the hotel. We have stayed in many hotels in Orlando going to the various theme parks and this was by far the best stay we have ever had. The combination of the Hard Rock Hotel, Universal Theme Parks and City Walk is one you just can't beat. At the end of our stay we asked for a late check out and they let us stay until 12:30 and once we left the room they took our bags and stored them for us and we were able to go back to the park and continue to use our Fast Passes and at the end of the day we had a quick dip in the pool and then called for our bags. The staff quickly helped us load up and still treated us like royalty.

I am happy to say that neither concern proved to be an issue. The Hard Rock Hotel is a beautiful property and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. I purchased a package through Universal Studios website that included theme park tickets and a reduced room rate. I had a garden view room that really didn't offer much of a view because it was obstructed by trees but that was fine as we did not stay here to look out the window. The pool is awsome and offers many shaded areas and yes you *can* hear music under water. We had lunch by the pool two times during our stay...The menu selection consists of sandwiches and salads which are delicious...prices are around $12 dollars for sandwiches which include salads, fruit or fries...an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill. The pool wait staff are very friendly and attentive...breakfast at The Kitchen is great but pricey...$16.95 for an all you can eat buffet. The Express Pass feature is FANTASTIC! Simply show your room key at any attraction in the parks and you bypass the regular lines...this feature alone is worth the price of staying on property. One other point....the beds are very firm...I found them to be comfortable but it is a point worth mentioning. Also, self parking is $15 dollars a day payable directly to the hotel when you check-in. (I hated that but what are you gonna do?) Would I go back? Yes indeed. Last year we stayed at Disney's Grand Floridian resort and the Hard Rock measures up nicely and even exceeds Disney's level of service.

It's in a beautiful location which, due to the landscaping, makes it feel secluded. Upon arrival, the bell hops are hopping and friendly. Valet is $22 per night and self-parking is $15. The hotel sits on a hill, and the parking lots are at the bottom on either side of the hotel. This means self-parking will require you to take a huge flight of stairs. So unload baggage before parking or have the bell hops drive down in an extended golf cart to assist if you want to tip. There is no elevator to the parking lot. Check in on a Monday afternoon was quick and friendly. We arrived around 2 and check in was not until 4. The girl said she would put a \"rush\" on our room and call us if we wanted to go to the pool. We did that and recieved a call at 3. Our room was very nice. LG flat screen TV, CD player, and iPod dock. Modern look with framed black and whites of musicians. We had poolview on the 6th floor which was great. The beds were very comfy with good pillows and down comforters. There was a table with two chairs and a comfortable chair and ottoman. There was also a coffee bar and mini fridge, but I believe it was locked. The coffee maker was the one cup Keurig. Internet service was $9.95 per day. The bathroom was nice because it had a sink and counter top outside the bathroom as well as a regular wall mount sink inside the bathroom. Both sinks had mirrors. And the one in the bathroom also had a small glass shelf mounted above it. The shower had great pressure. The tile floors were big, green tiles, not your normal hotel tile. There were spa type bath products. I couldn't find shampoo and conditioner anywhere, so called housekeeping. They came immediately with a small bag full. Once I entered the shower, I found it on a small corner shelf. We ordered room service one morning, which was fast and good. The breakfast buffet is $16.95 per adult and $10.95 for children. We did not try it. There were several restuarants in the hotel, and one was out by the pool. The pool was large with a water slide. There was a kiddie pool, a hot tub, an adult only hot tub, and several areas with water spraying for small children to play. The towel hut was on the way down to the pool, so grab one as you go. There were plenty of lounge chairs, some in shady areas and many in full sun. Some were even in white sand. Music was playing, but not too loud to make a cell phone call. The music was also piped underwater. There was poolside entertainment throughout the day for the kids. The first night they put out an inflatable screen and showed The Karate Kid. The second night there was a DJ who did fun games and interactions with the kids. He gave them mini inflatable guitars and did a girls vs boys rock out. Then he pulled out large inflatable guitars and called up moms and dads. There was also a hair wrap/gift shop cabana in the pool area as well. One great feature was that the pool stayed open until midnight. And although we had poolview, we could not hear the pool noise from our room. In the pool area there was a gate which leads to trails, beautifully landscaped wide sidewalks, taking you directly to Universal's main gate, City Walk, and Islands of Adventure. There was also a water taxi and pedicab available. The water taxi was free and the pedicab drivers worked strictly by tips. There were benches along the canal throughout the trails. And there was a butterfly garden near the water taxi area. Being able to walk/ride to the parks and come back and forth to the room and pool during the day was so much better than staying off-property. Definitely worth the extra money. And with teenage boys, it was great for them to be able to come and go all day on their own. Having a Fast Pass (room key) for the parks was probably the best part of all. The room key also allows you to charge to your room and send packages from the parks back to the hotel. Check out was 11, but the granted us 12:30 when I called to inquire about late check out. The room key continues to work as a Fast Pass and continues to grant access to the pool and self-parking lot throughout the day after check out.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cSo-So....

One of the biggest problems I had with the hotel was that the wireless in the room was so slow that I could not send large documents over the internet, and the hard-wired ethernet in my room did not work at all.

We were both looking forward to our stay and so wanted the hotel to be something special. The good things about the hotel are very good indeed. Firstly the location. Second to none. The room keys doubled as express passes in both Universal and Islands. This saved so much time in the ques. But what not a lot of people are aware of is they also get priority seating at most of the restraunts in City walk during the evenings. This again gives you more time to enjoy the place. We only found Bubba Gumps did not take part in this.The Gardens and the walk down to the city walk was wonderful. Just one thing, it is next to water and the noises you can hear being made by the creatures in the undergrowth after dark are not the squirrels. So no flip floops at night, or better yet take the water taxi. We also had no problems with the cleaniness of the room. Also the beds were supremly comfortable. That said it leds me on to my first area of criticism. 2 double beds is not what i would call 5 star treatment. We did enquire if rooms were available with bigger sizes only to be told that this was standard and we would have to pay for any upgrade.The room itself while being very stylish was let down by a number of things. No dvd player in the room, the electrical cables behind the appliances were a mess. Not Sure if I would let small children roam the floor. Any other 5 star we stayed at these would nrmally be wired in ( the cables, not the children.) The plumbing was terrible and very noisy. Every shower taken, toilet flushed or sinked filled, not only the rooms either side of us, but also above us, we would hear it. I am a light sleeper, however my wife is not and she was woken several time each and every night by this noise. My wife also informed me that one morning the sink filed with a dark brown liquid from the plug hole only to drain away again almost instantly. I never witnessed this, so I wonder if it happened regularly. The layout of the bathrooms is not to clever also. For some reason a dividing wall is at an odd angle. This just complicates the ergonomics of the available space. Trust me it sounds petty but every time i turned to reach for the toilet roll just reminded of the short comings. Also no walk in shower instead an over the bath type? Other things that just drop this place is having to rent the in-room fridge $15 a day. No complimentary car parking, again $15 daily. Plastic cups for the coffee in the room, not very polished. And the hotel claims to be trying to be green and the still use disposable cups? No bathrobes or slippers in the rooms, again what should be a given for a 5 star. The worst and possibly the smallest hotel room safe ever. But the clincer for me was the staff. Most just appeared to not bother. At the pool in 97 degree heat we waited for some service. The girl walk past our spot 3 times before I had to go the bar. We even tried calling her over, no joy. Most seemed to be having to good a time with each other to worry about the guests. I know thats not fair on all the staff, some were very good and were very attentive to or needs, but the bad one more than compensated for the good ones. I know it sounds bad, but this hotel just let itself down. It has great potential if only the managment and staff would allow it to meet it, it truly would be something special. That said I think you will have to go very far indeed to find a better 3 star hotel anywhere in the world.

As it turned out IOA wasn't all that crowded the day we visited - the longest queues without the Express Pass were only about 20 mins, but it was still nice to queue jump and we rode all the big rides several times.

My husband and I noticed a mildew smell mixed with cigerettes, we knew right away we could not stay in this room for the 7 day stay. We made our way back up to the the front desk and asked for another room and question why such an odor. He admitted that the main floor was recently cleaned since they no longer allow smoking in the rooms. I found it very rude not to inform parents with children before placing us there. Why would I want to subject my family to this when we are not smokers? Service Our room was cleaned once out of our 7 day stay. We had to call the front desk to ask for towels and for someone to come clean. The towels showed up but not the housekeeper to clean. At the pool we were told we can not bring our own snacks into the pool area and they asked to take our bag away. NO where in the hotel it states that we can not bring snacks of our own in and we did notice plenty of other snackers. My son has asthma and severe food allergies. We carry his special snacks and asthma medications in the bag. I carry my bag for the sake of an emergency, my sons emergency and this young waitress wanted to take my bag and store it for me until I leave the pool area. I informed her very quickly as to why we have this bag and she still continued on with the rules. The rules varied from person to person. The waitress looked young and immature desperate for tips.

The hard rock hotel was great although we did experience the thin walls folks talked about in here previously. I am not sure if they were just drunk and talking loud late into the night, or it was after hours and everyone else was just quiet. Luckily that group checked out the next a.m. so the next 4 days were fairly good, although you can hear everything out in the hall. Luckily we were towards the end of one of the wings so did not have too much traffic outside our door. We were not given a pool view room even though requested at early booking (probably due to our package price). We we were not in the room that much so not a big deal, but would have been nice. Room was average for a supposed 4 or 5 star hotel as advertised. It was ok for the 4 of us, but nothing elaborate, or anything that makes you go WOW. Pool was beautiful though and with the parks behind it was a great view from the elevator bay on club level, so those high rooms (floors 6&7) with hotel and park views should be great. Next time I will not book the club level ( this did not seem up to the same standards at Disney), as my kids did not take advantage and we ended up eating out more than planned. The breakfast was basically a Hampton inn style with no hot food. The evening appetizers were just a couple of basic things (chicken wings, egg rolls, etc) that was not all that appetizing to be honest. Free wine and beer were ok, but kids did not want to go in there to eat, so was a waste of $$$. We never used the fitness center and internet service is not included on the club level, other than one pc that is in use most of the time in the lounge. Book a high floor swimming pool view room instead and take a cooler. Use the package savings on meals and drinks at the pool. Hotel food and drinks were fairly expensive and every restaurant and bar added an 18% tip automatically, but the atmosphere was great and my kids had a blast at the pool. They had live bands and DJ's and showed Movies or Concerts (Springsteen) on DVD at night which the kids could watch from the heated pool, beachside chairs, or from the pool bar restaurant. We ended up spending most of our time at the pool when not at the parks or Citiwalk. Overall I would probably not pay that much to stay there again, but as everyone else says, the express lines you get access to with your room key makes it worth it. Over a Spring break or holiday I would say it's the only way to go. The express passes they sell in the park are only good for 1 express ride per attraction where the room keys are as many times as you want. My boys rode the log ride and roller coasters all day at Islands of Adventure and that would not have been possible any other way with the crowds. We waited less than 5 minutes at the rides at Islands of Adventure and maybe 10 minutes at the most at Universal Studio's park. Most of the time you just walk right on. I would say the Hard Rock is a great safe place for the teenage family to stay and go to the theme parks, but once was enough for us. I doubt we go back as we just didn't feel it was quite as good as Disney. The staff at the hotel were nice, but there is a difference in the attitude and value at the parks. My wife thought it was much more noticeable than my boys and I, but after being at both places we all liked Disney better from a theme park perspective, maybe they can put in a Hard Rock Hotel over there Two last notes-- I did not think the music was overwhelming as some have written. The lobby and pool bar are rocking all day, but it was not as bad as some have made it out to be. I enjoyed the music at the pool, it kept your toes tapping ;) The other thing was the theme park hours and restaurants at the parks. They seemed to cut the hours back and several restaurants were not opened which was a bit of a bummer. I guess they did that to cut costs with this economy, but the spring break crowd looked pretty good to me with waiting lines at the restaurants that were open. Would have been nice if they would have reduced the cost of the tickets in proportion to the hours and restaurant availability. They also did not have early park entry available as advertised for hotel guests, although with the express pass was not a big deal. Just additional reasons to head back to Disney i guess.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "knoxville", "Title": "\u201cGreat Spring Break with extended family - would go back.\u201d", "Author": "10kin", "ReviewID": "UR26581275", "Content": "Our family of four (tween and teen) as well as grandparents spent Spring Break at the HRH on club level (7th floor).

We arrived on Monday afternoon and stayed until Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. We had a wonderful time here. Last year at the same time, we stayed at the Royal Pacific Hotel, another Universal Loew's Property, which we also enjoyed. My husband wanted to try the Hard Rock and my friend had stayed here in the spring and had a great time with her hubby and six-year old daughter. The room was very comfortable; we stayed on the 5th floor in a Garden View room with two double beds for myself and hubby and our 12-year old son. We booked our stay through Southwest Air. We were pleased with our fast passes; it is a bit of a challenge though to have to go to the park to collect our \"Stay four/Play Four\" free passes to Universal and Islands of Adventure for the week with Guest Services. The agent we got insisted that we owed a balance and even called our credit card company; after continuously reminding him that we paid everything in full already, he finally apologized (after a 15 minute wait) and said he had been \"confused' - eesh - hardly the VIP experience! At Royal Pacific last year, we received nice pouches that we could carry our park passes and Fast Passes in; when I inquired at the desk at Hard Rock, the agent recomended we purchase the same at the gift store...NOT! The above is the only bad complaints I can come up with after staying there for four nights and five days. We ate at The Kitchen the first night and loved it; I had awesome potato and leek soup and crab cakes. We loved the pool and grounds and the convenience of walking to the parks and the Fast Passes and two free park passes. Last year while staying at Royal Pacific, we rented a car, but after being charged $15/day to park at the hotel, we decided to book round trip shuttle service from Orlando Int'l Airport to the Hard Rock through Mears Transportation Service instead. For a mere $28/person roundtrip, this was the way to go. They picked us up immediately upon arrival and delivered us to our hotel after one stop at Royal Pacific. It was a bit more crowded on the return trip to the airport the day after Thanksgiving, but the driver was five minutes early and we arrived in plenty of time for our flight back to CT! We also made use of the free shuttle service from Hard Rock to Sea World on Thanksgiving Day! Book this service 24 hours in advance through the hotel and it is easy and FREE! All in all, a great service. We had a full size travel/coach bus, and it was more than over 1/2 empty. Wonderful and convenient and free! Loved the Hard Rock's pool and water slide as well as the garden walkway; on the last day we went lizard hunting before leaving for our flight and discovered a gorgeous butterfly garden complete with orange trees behind our hotel - beautiful! The staff was very friendly. Tip: if you fly Southwest Airlines and want to get your boarding pass, just let the Concierge know at least one day ahead of time and provide your travel confirmation number, flight number and times, number of people traveling, and the Hard Rock Staff will make sure that you are in the front of the line for boarding! We didn't think of this last year at Royal Pacific Hotel and wound up being scattered all over the plane (party of 3!); this year we all wound up in Boarding Group A with our pick of where to sit (all together!) All in all, a most restful and enjoyable trip to Orlando.

The Rocky horror tribute and Bill and Ted show were excellent. As for the parks we had great fun and as you stay in Universal your room key acts as a fast pass. There's also a place there called City walk with bars ,night clubs and restaurants. We went into the Irish bar, the Karaoke bar and a night club but for me Margherita bar and restarant was the best , a lively place with great food and a live band.

Lucky for us, first night was comped, second night was half off. I can't imagine paying $300+ per night to stay here! What we liked: the service. Every employee we interacted with was super polite and seemed to go out of their way to be helpful. Pool area was gorgeous. Rooms had nice decor. Fun freebie CD with checkin. Easy proximity to City Walk. Adorable squirrels everywhere on the property. Loved them! Nice little cafe and starbucks on-site for reasonably priced grab and go snacks. Cool rock memorabilia and decor everywhere. What we didn't like: THE NOISE. It was inescapable!! The rooms were not soundproofed at all! I could hear the neighbor's music, toilets, in the hall, etc etc etc. The music everywhere was overwhelming at times. Yea it was great in the afternoon and evenings, but when I was reading the paper at the pool in the morning, Ozzie's Crazy Train was a bit off-putting. Also, the little towels in the room barely covered my whole body. At that price point, most hotels will give you giant bath sheets and robes. And don't even get me started about the fee to park. Ridiculous!! Self-parking was $15, valet was $25. And if you access the mini-bar, be prepared for a 22% service charge. So... it was a nice stay, but had I been spending my own money, I would have been sorely disappointed. I would only stay again if I got a helluva deal.

We had booked a garden view room. As we were travelling from Europe we had 4 suitases with us. The woman at the reception desk didn't call a bell boy or offer us any help whatsoever upon check in, ignoring the luggage and showing us with her finger the way to the elevators. We struggled to get to our room. First thing I noticed was the musty smell. Wanted to open the windows to let some fresh air in and ....the window wouldn't open, because it isn't really a window. More like a glass panel. I considered calling reception and ask if they could switch us to another room, but it was pretty late and we were tired from our drive from Miami. Besides, we were only staying there 2 nights and our main purpose was to visit the parks, not staying in. The room was ok, but the whole decor was a little tired. The bathroom was quite small for US standars. We booked the room with breakfast buffet included for practical reasons, and it was pretty good if you don't take into consideration the dirty water they call coffee, or the fact that there was no cheese platter. Actually, the only thing with cheese they had on the buffet turned out to be a kind of pastry, another sweet treat. 2 days before leaving home, I received an e-mail informing me the pool would be unavailable for the duration of our stay since they'd be doing work on it and the surrounding bar. One of the main attractions for me to book at the Hard Rock was the sound system in the pool.... They did offer free shuttle to the other two hotels in the park to visit their pools, but if you are tired from your day in the parks and want to just chill for 30 min, you don't feel like taking a bus and drive to another hotel. Same story upon check out, we had to carry our own suitcases (I had gone to check out 15 minutes earlier having left the luggage in the room). Neither somebody helped us when my husband was loading the suitcases and bags into the trunk of our car, even though there were 3 bell boys standing there, chatting. We were dissapointed with the customer service at this hotel and we'll definitely stay in one of the other 2 hotels next time we visit the parks.

Unlike the Royal Pacific, where at least you can have a quick service breakfast in peaceful comfortable surroundings, at the Hard Rock there is nowhere to go except the noisy ice cream parlour.

We have 5 children- all teenagers and after visiting Disney in 2000 when the chidren were small we decided to stay on site at Universal to take advantage of the express pass system. THe hotel is stunning as you arrive through the main entrance and the valets were exceptionally helpful at all times as quite often they had to order us taxis as there were 7 of us. Nothing was too much trouble. We had two interconnecting rooms which were beautifully cleaned and well stocked and we had no problems with the maid service whatsoever. The only negative point on the rooms was that we were right at end of the corridor and it was quite a walk from the lifts which were not that centrally located. The pool was great, if a little shallow & the entertainment was great both day & night. The children loved going for late night swims whilst the music played. Every time we went to the pool we were able to get sunbeds both in the shade & sun which is in quite contrast to European holidays. The two weekends we were there we stayed at the pool during the day to avoid the busy parks & did find the pool busier than in the week but not a problem at all. We ate a lot at the Kitchen which was great & at least 4 times the characters Shrek, Scooby Doo & Homer Simpson came to most tables whilst dining. This was great for families with younger children but mine liked it too. The concierge were very helpful and advised us about restaurants & when to visit certain parks outside of Universal. There was lots of interesting memorabilia in the hotel & whilst we were there Princess Dian'a dresses were on display. The location of the hotel was outstanding with just a 5 minute walk to the 2 universal theme parks & Citywalk & the express queue system was just brilliant. To sum up, our teenagers loved this hotel and its closeness to Universal. There was no hassle & if they wanted to they could go to the park themselves with their room keys while we relaxed at the pool.

In both of the rooms, there was only a bedside table on one side of the bed and the bath was tiny (our parent's room didn't even have a bath, only a shower). When we arrived at the hotel, the valet and parking attendants were really nice and by the end of our stay they knew our names. We were greeted by a really nice girl at the reception who was very efficient and there were no problems with our room and we could go straight up to it. We were on the Club Level which meant we had breakfast and hors d'ouevres included. They were really tasty and you didn't have to go out and eat elsewhere if you didn't want to. The concierge were really helpful in the Club Lounge and could easily get you places for dinner at restaurants throughout Universal. You need your room key to get to the floor so make sure you have it on you at all times otherwise you need to go to reception and get a new one. The major bonus of the Hard Rock Hotel are the room keys. They allow you to skip the queues as many times as you want. It meant we were able to finish both parks in under four hours having done most rides at least twice. For us the housekeeping was good but we did hear people moaning about them in the lounge. We were opposite a closet where they kept a lot of the cleaning stuff so we were first on their list to do. However if you do ask them to come back later make sure you ring housekeeping to make sure they do come back. We didn't eat at the Kitchen but the Palm was incredible, the most delicious steaks I've ever tasted and was well worth going but was expensive.

We had again upgraded our room to 'Club' so we were in a position to compare! On two previous occasions we have stayed at the Royal Pacific (not Club Room) but fancied a change this visit. On entering the hotel lobby there was definitely a 'wow' factor. Great area, with amazing memorabila on show. Our room on the Club floor was nice, very modern and contemporary. We did ask for a room furthest away from the lift area as I had read reports of the hotel sometime being noisy. Although the view wasn't great - the room was quiet! First impressions of the hotel were all good. Great access to City Walk and the Parks (which is the reason we choose Universal Hotels - and the fast pass is a MUST!). Club Room: Very different experience from that we had at the Hyatt! We did not feel 'exclusive' in anyway. The breakfast was pastries (and more pastries), cereal, toast, tea/coffee etc. You could pop in during the afternoon and grab a soft drink (if there was any available) and the evening beer/wine/snacks was only on offer from 5pm-7pm. Needless to say, come 5pm the place was heaving. We don't actually eat until around 9 pm - so we felt we had to go out earlier just to grab a couple of glasses of wine to ensure we had out monies worth! Personally, wished we had saved the money. It was amusing to watch some folk come in during the morning grabbing large numbers of bottled water, food and soft drinks and disappearing back to their rooms (or packing the stuff in their ruck sacks!). Similar things happened during the evening too - how sad! We ate in the Kitchen restaurant twice and the pool bar just the once - very reasonable priced food and good. With there being no lobby bar we had to physically go into the Velvet bar which was for over aged 21's only. Our daughter (who is 16) could obviously not come in so this really limited us going in there together before going out to dinner. I fully appreciate the legal age of 21 being required - but offering no differentiation between aged 0 and 20 seems ludicrous to me and I think this probably stops a lot of folk from actually using the bar - shame - its really nice! Even allowing teenagers in until 9pm would have been more acceptable. Pool Area: Nice area, but got very busy early but the pool was really shallow (3ft) The Hard Rock was definitely more expensive than the Hyatt, and the upgraded Club Room was defintely not worth the extra money.

Then the hair blow dryer did not work and as we were leaving the gate would not go up on the parking lot and there was a line of about 15 cars until some guy got out and just bent the gate up so everyone could leave. This hotel has some serious management issues. They need to hire more housekeepers so that the rooms are ready when they say they will be ready. The only thing that keeps me from giving it one star is that the staff was very nice. It was obvious that their hands were tied and they couldn't do anything more. Eugene in the Club room was especially great and the only reason I was able to keep my temper from getting the best of me. Next time we'll just take a cab as the restaurant was great.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbus, ohio", "Title": "\u201cFun, Nice, Express Pass Worth It\u201d", "Author": "audnlou", "ReviewID": "UR18142117", "Content": "We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel for five nights.

They were delivered by friendly staff, and in a reasonable amount of time. The choice of menu in your room was great, but the prices were high, but this is expected in a high-class hotel. The room that I was allocated had a mini-bar, large t.v., iron, safe, coffee maker etc. inside it. One of the big positives about the hard rock is the location. You only need a 5-minute walk to get to Universal CityWalk and Studios. Throughout the stay I witnessed security in all areas of the hotel from the pool areas to the lobby etc. This is good for peace of mind.

You need to accept all the highs with the lows though, and sometimes I continue to be amazed that this hotel has a supposed 4.5* rating. The highs: it is such a short walk to the parks. The pool and the Beach Club are great. The rooms are big enough and well-appointed. We love the theming and the music. For my birthday, they sent a lovely gift to the room which was thoughtful and unexpected. The lows: we have stayed at the HRH Orlando 4x now in one year for 23 nights total. Housekeeping is terribly inconsistent. We've had housekeeping try to enter the room at least twice with the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign clearly hanging on the door knob. Sometimes we get turn-down service; most of the time we don't and have to make repeated phone calls for the service. (Turn-down service is in our profile and is supposed to be automatic when staying in a suite, which we always do since we're Loews First Platinum). I have had terrible experiences with room service food quality as well. But, this takes the cake: we checked out of the HRH Orlando one morning, and maybe 3 hours afterwards, my husband realized that he left 3 brand new shirts in the room. Brand new as in never even been worn. Yes, we should've checked the drawers more carefully. Upon realizing this, we immediately called the hotel and were put through to security. Security didn't care. I had explained who we were, that we had checked out approx 3 hours ago, exactly what we left behind, what room they were in, and which drawer they were in. Security didn't care, and told me to call back after 6 pm because \"that's when things get turned in.\" This was between noon and 1 pm, and security wouldn't even bother to check if someone else had checked into the room yet. If someone had, I could see calling back after 6pm. But, security would not even make a call to housekeeping on our behalf. We called back after 6pm to follow up. It was just a tired, \"Nope. Nothing turned in yet. Call back in an hour.\" Another call an hour later yielded nothing; only that the HRH would take our information \"in case something turned up.\" Thanks for all the help. I've left a shirt behind at the Hampton Inn, and when I called, they immediately retrieved the shirt from the room and mailed it back to me at no charge. The Hampton Inn follows up with guests, but apparently this type of service is lacking from the HRH. I was annoyed at the complete lack of response from the HRH, and e-mailed their management. I did receive a friendly little note that they would do their best to find the shirts and get back to me. That was a full month ago. Needless to say that was last I heard from them. I am over the shirts. We absolutely should've checked the drawers (and this is the last time I believe my husband when he tells me he's done so ;) ). However, the lack of caring and utter unresponsiveness from this so called 4* property leaves me just shaking my head. So, take this word of warning from me: check and recheck the room for left behind items, because you will not get them back. Security and/or Housekeeping plays Finder's Keepers.

The common areas of the hotel are very well appointed with a friendly staff. Our room was a double queen and quite small compared to many other hotel chains that cater to business travelers. While clean and comfortable, the lighting in the room especially the changing area outside the bathroom was dim. Otherwise the beds are comfortable and the room suits its purpose if you are going to spend most of your time at Universal. We did request an additional rollaway bed which the hotel gladly provided for $25 each night. My biggest complaint was the lack any sort of controllable fan in the room HVAC. It is either on of off and is very quiet while running. While some may find this desirable, this is a busy hotel with guest coming and going at all hours. Especially in the early am hours, there are many guests returning from the bars at the City Walk. Unfortunately, many of them liquored up and loud. Because there is no sort of white noise to mask sounds outside the room, we were woken up frequently by loud guests. Also, this hotel caters to families, many with younger children i.e lots of hallway sprinting at 7am. While the hotel is hardly to blame for this, they could easily help mask the noise by installing or making available some sort of white noise generator in the rooms i.e the sound of a fan. The pool area is quite nice and relaxing. The palm trees and music give a real caribbean feel to this! As can happen anywhere, the only turnoff was the behavior of a few idiots. We did see one guest get in the hot tub with his shoes on and another who put his cigarette out in the water. As expected, this is not the place to go if you are on a tight budget. A cup of coffee was $4 in the cafe downstairs. A two shot bourban on the rocks at poolside was $13. A 16oz draft beer is about $6. We ate off site both days so I cant comment on the restaurant prices. Fortunately, we traveled with some friends who are Florida residents and were able to take advantage of a Florida resident discount room rate We mainly chose this hotel for the Universal Express pass priviledges as well as its close proximity. Although there are water taxi's to shuttle you back to the hotel, in most cases, its quicker to simply walk back. About 10 minutes and the walking path is very well landscaped and shaded. The days of our visit, both parks were crowded and the express pass most certainly paid off. We were able to get through most lines in 5-10 minutes. Some even shorter. Your room key also gives you priority seating at the City Walk restaurants. Some had waits of 2+ hours. By showing our room key, we were able to be seated in about 30 minutes.

No one greeted us immediately to help us with our baggage. The desk person had to call a bellperson to come and help us. I didn't feel catered to like in the past. We're not smokers, but we took a room that allowed smoking and was located on the first floor. It was available for our checkin, and we were early. (about 2:15pm)The first floor is not nearly as nice as the third floor, but it was very quiet. The bathroom was a little worn, and the beds weren't as soft and wonderful as the ones on the third floor. There were definitely less staff members, and room service was very unimpressive. The woman dropped off our meal on a fully expanded table. We had to literally take the food off the table, put the leaves down, and then reset up the table and place the food back on it after pushing it further into the room past the bar so that we could eat off of it. The lady dropped off the table and pretty much ran. I tipped her, but I almost had to chase her. It was only after she left that we realized the table wouldn't fit in the room without being taken apart. On the bright side, the room was right near the ice cream shop and on the same level as the pool and the Kitchen restaurant. The Kitchen is a little pricey, but the food is very good. I recommend the filet minon. YUM. The staff there are wonderful as well. They were very attentive, especially the young man with the blonde hair and the young man with the rosary bead tattoo. The ice cream is very reasonably priced, so we ate lots of it. The parks are a very short walk from the hotel. They are wonderful for kids of all ages. The pool is nice, but it gets crowded quickly. The man that supervises the kids' pool activities is wonderful! My 12 year old daughter had a blast. It was also very nice to have food and drinks delivered to us at the pool, but beware that there is an automatic 18% gratuity tacked onto the food and drinks. I felt that it was worth it. They gave ample amounts of food, and the servers were VERY attentive. (especially Tiffany and a young man that was African American with an underlip piercing) But I fear that like the economy, the hotel has seen better days. It's still nice, but it's not lavish and pampering like it used to be. For the price, I expected the same experience as I had last year.

I asked for a room not on the third floor since that is level of the lobby and I assumed it would be loud (there was a concert while we were there in the lobby). We were put on the 6th floor in a garden view. We never heard any loud noises after about 11:00 at night and were never awakened in the mornings so maybe staying in a room away from the pool is a better idea. We spent one full day at the pool and really enjoyed it. Although the drinks and food at the pool were really expensive, it was a nice splurge to get them delivered to you in your beach chair (my younger daughter felt like a rock star). We had dinner and breakfast at the Kitchen and it was very good. Other mornings we just grabbed coffee and cereal at the ice cream shop. Our room was standard but much larger than other hotels we have stayed at. It was clean and the beds were comfortable. I didn't notice any wear and tear as others have indicated, the carpet probably could have used a cleaning but even that was not bad. We had no problems with check out, they held our bags for us since our flight did not leave until late that night. We were able to enjoy the parks all day. The best part as many have said is the express pass. We never waited more than 5 minutes for any ride. It was amazing and really made going to the parks a joy. If you ask my kids what the best part of the trip was, they will tell you it was the express pass. The walk to the parks was beautiful and only took a few minutes. We took the water shuttle once. My only complaint would be the free shuttle to Sea World. It departed the hotel at about 10:00 a.m. and left Sea World at about 5:00 p.m. We planned to spend the entire evening there watching the evening shows and having dinner so we ended up taking a taxi back to the hotel. Would be nice if they had a later shuttle as well. If you go to the parks, don't miss eating at Mythos.

But we got upgraded to a KingSuite and stayed on the club floor the last time; and this time we did 2 adjoining rooms and were put on the 2nd floor. The rock and roll music at the pool begins at 9 a.m. and you can hear it clearly through the walls. Many people walk down the halls with their children and when they speak their voices echo; the acoustics down there are terrible. Sometimes we didn't get fresh shampoo/conditioner and they seemed stingy with the other toiletries as well. There were errors on our bill (we were charged 2 Valet parkings because we had 2 rooms, even though we only had one car) per day; which they gladly fixed but we had to bring it to their attention. So my advice would be: Stay on a Club floor, at least on Floor 5 6 or 7, it's quieter!

We booked our travel package ( air/hotel) thru expedia with no glitches. Our kids loved the pool and the life guards were extremely attentive to the kids. There was always some sort of activity being held in the pool area. The DJ Scooter was very good, and really got the kids involved in contests and other fun activities for 4 hours! The \"counselors\" were fun, the kids loved them, and they appeared to really love their job. They were having fun along with the kids. On Saturday night, it poured rain and the pool was closed. In the lobby area, the staff brought out all sorts of board games, Guitar Hero, and Rock Band was being played by the kids, and there was a movie being played too. All these activties were going on simultaneously. Also, some counselors were playing Duck, Duck Goose, Simon says, Choo Choo with all the little kids. We were really impressed. It was like a huge sleepover in a really big mansion! Everyone was having fun. The rooms were very nice. Spacious and had every accommodation you could think of. The food at The Kitchen was good, especially the Breakfast Buffet in the morning, but pricey. We ate in the Ice Cream place/Starbucks place for lunch and snacks at night. Like with any resort in Orlando, go knowing you'll be nickeled and dimed, and just be conservative on what you do and where you eat. One thing that torqued us a little was that they charged $14 per day to park your car! We rented a car and other people drove down to FL. People have to get there somehow, and paying to park the car is a rip off! Just a money making sceme. Overall, I wouldn't let this wreck our stay and you shouldn't either. It was a really fun place, lots of good classic rock music playing, real close ( walking distance) to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, and CityWalk. CityWalk is a large outdoor shopping area with lots of restaurants and touristy shops. Prices were too bad, and we ate dinner there most of the time. Bubba Gumps Shrimp Company was very good, and so was Margaritaville. My husband and I commended the valets and all the staff on our way out about the service and that we gave them all A+'s!

There were only two bad points - the incessant piped rock music that you cannot escape from (although what should I have expected?) and the fact that there can be some raucous guests.

Don't get me wrong, we spent loads of time with the kids. Universal, Islands of Adventure, the new Aquatica park, Discovery Cove and Wet and Wild and Seaworld. But we seemed to finish up at the parks around 2:00 p.m. Went back to the pool at HRH, and then sometimes the kids would head back for a few hours. The kids loved it! They met other teenagers, hung out in the hot tub, played volleyball. All around the 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 age group! We dined at the Palms, which was somewhat of a let down, because there were tons on little kids..very pricey, but food was good. We dined one evening outside on the terrace at the Kitchen, at was a bit more reasonably priced. The beach bar/restaurant was fantastic. We also made a reservation at Emrils restaurant for 8, but then changed the reservation to 4 and let the kids do there thing at Citywalk...they just checked in with us. We sat next to AL ROKER!!! Food was without question incredible, service was second to none! VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE...but if you can swing it, it was so good! We ventured out to a restaurant call Bonefish...Not the chain FISHBONES, but Bonefish. Ask a the front desk, it's only about a mile away, and the food and atmosphere was fantastic. The kids came with us and they loved it! If you stay here, just expect to spend, spend, spend....we skipped breakfast every morning and just grabbed a bagel and juice in the market at the hotel. It was not too bad. The location of this hotel is steps away from both parks. The fast pass was worth staying here because we skipped lines, never waited....which allowed us to be back at the hotel early to enjoy the tropical atmosphere, and have a few cocktails! All in all, we loved it! Service was awesome, no problems what so ever! Stay here if you can treat yourself and your teens....great for youngster too!

We are a family of 4 with kids aged 12 and 14, so this was a nice change from the Disney trips we've taken in the past. We view spring break as our family trip, and we don't mind spending for a quality experience. Last year we were in Maui, the year before Atlantis in the Bahamas, and in between Cozumel and several Disney trips, including the short and longer cruises - we make spring break a priority family time and I spend time researching where we're going so we are sure to maximize the time for family fun. We had heard great things about this property and opted for the club level, which meant extra concierge services and food and beverage presentations throughout the day - something we took advantage of especially in the morning and late afternoon. That level also includes free admission to the fitness center, and I took advantage of that and enjoyed the fact that I could breeze in and out. The hotel key cards serve as your express pass for all Universal and Islands of Adventure rides, which was fabulous and well worth it to us. We ate at Kitchens two nights and found it to be very good - the kids thought the character visits were fun, too. The pool is large and well maintained, and they had a dj there who kept the kiddos involved and active. There's plenty of waitstaff who are quick to attend to your every need - in fact we were impressed with all the staff at the hotel. Anything we asked for they were only too happy to help us with. The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the parks and to City Walk, which provided lots of dinner options and extra entertainment. Truly a fun time. We paid a higher rate given the time of year ($499 a night) but given all that we got in return felt it was well worth it. The rooms are ready for refurbishing, true, but I heard that the club level is set for a renovation this year, which it needs. The last day of our trip there was a near drowning incident in the pool -- a mom turned her back for a moment and her very young daughter (who clearly couldn't swim) went under - we were very impressed with how quickly the lifeguards sprang to action. My husband is a heart surgeon and was one of two docs and an EMT who also ran right over - the guard administered CPR and she began breathing and was quickly taken to a hospital. This kind of thing happens anywhere -- it was clear that the hotel took it very seriously as they cleared the pool and quite a few staff were present and working to quickly stabilize the situation. There are lots of lifeguards present - but parents should always be alert for their children, especially when there are lots of active people in the pool. Speaking of the pool, the night movies were neat - you could swim while watching the latest feature and that was a neat extra, too.

We were too tired to inquire about it that night, so the next morning I went to the front desk and they happily credited me the difference (since we didn't really care to move). We had the breakfast buffet in The Kitchen (hotel restaurant), which was very good and came to about $22/per person including drinks and tip. We really enjoyed the stroll through the Universal grounds to get to the Islands of Adventure park. Make sure you get your park tickets at the hotel. We forgot to do that and had to wait in line with everyone else...and that took a while! Once in the park, we breezed right through all the rides with our hotel key express passes and were finished in only a few short hours! It was really great...we had time to do a lot of other activites throughout the day because of those passes! Parking was $14 a day. I don't know if that is normal or not, but no big deal. The pool area was gorgeous, although if you're looking to lay in the sun, it is hard to find a good spot because of the abundance of palm trees! We had to move a couple times because the shade from the trees kept falling on us. The pool restaurant and bar opens at 11:00am, and they have very nice servers taking care of you as you sit by the pool. I had a Pina Colada (with a rum floater!) along with a Turkey Wrap, both of which were delicious!

All the Universal hotels are awesome, particularly the hard rock. I like the Royal Pacific the most, as it has the least amount of children running around and screaming, but the Hard Rock is my favorite as far as ambience. If you are a music fan, the memoribilia alone will keep you busy for hours. We LOVE being able to take our 2 small dogs with us and will not stay in a hotel where we can't take the mutts. They cater to pet lovers and we reward them with our continued business. The hotel itself is the definition of cool. Modeled after the eagles hotel california it is almost like a rock stars palatial estate. The restaurants and bars are always great and the bartenders are super cool and generous with the tequila. The Hard Rock music venue is easily walkable an we always stay at the hard rock when we go there and see a show. The performers stay at the hard rock hotel and you can usually catch them hanging in the Velvet bat after the show. My wife got to meet Bonnie Raitt when she performed there and we drank with the band after the show. We have stayed on the universal properties about 15-20 times in the last 5 years and have loved it every time. Unlike the enormous Disney, Universal is centered around the closely located base of Universal city walk. You can easily walk from any of the hotels to any of the theme parks and restaurants in about 5 minutes. they also have water taxis if you donlt want to walk and sweat to death in july and august. Emerils Tchoup Chop at the royal pacific is amazing and even the theme restaurants like margaritaville are great. Universal feels like a connected small town that you can walk.The lone drawback is the pool at the hard rock...it is so cool that everyone that stays in any of the 3 hotels at universal usually ends up at the hard rock pool. It is HUGE and has a great water slide. If you want to relax an enjoy it though, forget it. Even the hot tubs are full of 8-14 year olds. if you enjoy hearing \"like\" 17 times in each sentence and unsupervised children splashing hot tub water up your nose, it's right up your alley. We usually truck on over to the royal pacific and kick back in their pool even when we stay at the hard rock. room servce is great as well. If you want to go to the parks, staying at the universal hotels is MUST. Even though it expensive to stay there, imaging being able to be in your room 5-10 minutes after leaving the park exhausted AND your room key lets you take the hotel entrance and bypass all the regular schlubs standing in line for rides.

We stayed here strictly because they wanted to go to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure/Wet & Wild. This hotel is a great choice if you have teenage kids and want to go to the parks. Universal is within walking distance and the hotel will provide free shuttle service to the 2 other hotels on the Universal property. The Pros: The location is great and the kids really loved the cool \"rock and roll\" feel of the hotel. I was impressed that eery single employee was super friendly and went out of their way to be so. The service was top notch so they must be doing something right as far as training their employees. While the kids went to the park my husband and I stayed by the pool most days, and the pool is outstanding. They have a sandy beach pool which was heaven, and there were plenty of friendly servers who provided efficient service with drinks and food. The Palm restaurant is on premises and we dined there 2 nights. The food is outstanding by New York standards (we eat at The Palm in NYC all the time). In fact, the food throughout the hotel is excellent. We had breakfast every morning at The Kitchen and lunch by the pool every day and it never disappointed. We also got a ride one night to the Bice Restaurant at the Portofino Hotel on night and the food and service there was excellent as well. Yes, we all gained a few pounds on this vacation but it was worth it! The kids used their room keys for \"express\" access at the park to get to the front of the lines and they loved it. The Cons: I am Loews First Gold member and I have stayed at many Loews properties and although there are many positives about this hotel, I was disappointed with the quality, and the feel of the room furnishings. The bed felt cheap and hard, and the linens were rough and felt like sheets from a Days Inn. There were obvious stains on the carpet and they politely advise you that the sheets will only be changed every 3 days. I felt that the housekeeper did a less than adequate job cleaning the bathroom and room. In summary, if you are visting Universal and want a place to stay with the kids I would definitely recommend this hotel. The kids will love it. However, for the parents, do not expect a \"luxury\" experience. For the moms, there is no spa on the premises. There is a Manadara Spa at one of the other hotels (the Polynesian?) but it was too far to walk and I didn't want to take the shuttle.

At first, I saw the Hotel and was amazed. As we pulled up in the taxi I was so excited by the huge, amazing looking hotel, with all the flashy cars outside and the extravagant reception. The staff were friendly, opening the taxi doors and taking our bags to check in for us. We went to check out the hotel and the swimming pool area looked absolutely amazing and I couldn't wait to hop in! When I eventually got in the pool I didn't like the fact that it was mainly full of posers, who would stand around in the pool up to their waists, sipping on cocktails and bottles of beer. I also didn't like the fact that the pool floor was covered in sand from the man made beach. The room's weren't that impressive either. It was nice to have a 32\" LCD TV, but that's about it. The bathroom was quite small and non de-script, the bedding was plain and boring, the view was a white wall of the hotel and a tree top and none of the rooms have balconies. coming from England and staying somewhere as hot as this, you want to enjoy your holiday and stand on your balcony looking at the nice view - but you won't find this at the Hard Rock. On our first night at the Hard Rock we couldn't sleep. The room next door was playing really loud music and they were all drinking in their rooms and running up and down the corridors until the early hours. My Dad went outside to complain, where there was already a member of staff so obviously someone else had complained first. The hotel definitely needs some sound-proofing work done to it. We got up early the next morning and headed off to Universal studios. It's a lovely short walk with nice scenery and the queues weren't too bad for getting our tickets. One good thing about staying at a Universal Hotel is the free transport and the fact you can queue jump the rides with your hotel passes. In previous years we had stayed at Disney for the full 2 weeks and found traveling to the Universal parks expensive and time consuming. I would like to say that the hotel staff were friendly, but most of them weren't, in fact I found some of them to be quite rude and stuck up. Overall I wasn't impressed with this hotel at all; the rooms were nothing special, the pool wasn't relaxing, the food was quite bland (except for the expensive restaurants - their food was delicious!) and the rooms don't even have balconies!! I much referred my stay at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge (in fact I much preferred my stay in previous years at Disney's All star Resorts). At the Animal Kingdom, the gym was free to use and internet connection was fairly cheap. At this hotel the gym and internet was expensive.

After check in we were booked on club level 7 which is worth the money if you have kids, as drinks and snacks for them free all day and night (saved us a fortune) also the buffet breakfast and dinner included was adequte for us, ( not to mention the free beer etc between 5 and 7pm) I have seen a few reviews saying the food is expensive but we didnt think so, the Kitchen was as cheap as any average cafe/restaurant but let me tell you the food was superior. Pool was great with the water slide and it being shallow all round was a bonus for us just to keep dipping in for a cool off. The memorabilia around the place is amazing youll take loads of pics if your like us.The location is spot on for IOA an USF we even took the free boat transport just for the hell of it even though it is only a 5 - 10 min walk right to front of the parks. Drinks didnt seem too expensive and again the service is excellent in all bars. Snacks around the pool in evening are also well priced.

We're in our early 30's and were looking for a great place to stay close to Universal and downtown. We researched several options and decided to splurge on the Hard Rock and were not disappointed. We stayed Dec. 3-8 in a king club level room. Yes, it was pricey, but worth every penny. The room was modern and classy, and having access to the club room all day was great. We like to eat several small meals a day, so the continental breakfast, evening appetizers & drinks and bedtime sweets were all just what we needed to make our stay nice and relaxed as opposed to a constant search for something low priced and good to eat. We also usually spend a small fortune paying for sodas and waters in vending machines when in hotels, so access to unlmited sodas and water all day was a big bonus for us. The hotel staff was FANTASTIC. Everyone was friendly, accomodating and helpful, from the club room concierge right down to the valets. Room service was prompt, and the food wonderful. The proximity to the Universal Parks and Citywalk really made the Hard Rock a total fit for us. We could walk out of our room and be through the front gates in 5-10 minutes depending on just how fast we were walking. We could pop back over to the hotel at anytime without feeling like we were giving up a lot of time in the parks. Water taxis run until 2am as well, so if your feet are aching by the end of the day like mine, you needn't walk home. We can't really tell you much about the restaurants in the hotel. We dined out quite a bit. We did have appetizers in Velvet which were great. The portions are huge, so watch out! What really surprised me was that the drink prices we're ridiculous. I've paid a lot more for drinks at bars in major cities. One restaurant to check out is Bice at the Portofino. The have a mushroom ravioli that is to die for! Basically, we had a great stay. The parks and the hotel were empty all week, so we had the place to ourselves and really enjoyed it.

I would just like to put this hotel in the proper perspective for those of you that travel a lot like we do. First of all the positives - - The employees are great, they are the hotels #1 asset. -The Kitchen buffet breakfast is very very good - we paid 17.00 a person and were happy to do so for the convenience, food and most mornings great service. - The Palms - one of the very best restaurants in Orlando. - the atmosphere - if you are a rock fan - need I say more? The decor, the big screen rock concerts in the lounge, live rock concert in the lobby(added charge), the constant music, etc. - Almost Everything is very clean - rooms, grounds, pool area, restaurants, , only place was the outside bar/restaurant. The menus were dirty, tables dirty, service slow and not too good - only there once. The needed better or more employees there. - Walking to the park, front of the line access. The negatives - - The rooms are very average, although the queen beds are a plus. The club rooms are exactly the same as the standard rooms- they should be better. Some of the \"garden view\" rooms are an embarrassment to Loews. If you look out your window and see a dirty roof top and a parking lot - refuse to stay there. The feeling is of a highway side flea bag hotel. - Very limited facilities. There is 1 warped cheap pingpong table and 1 billiard table that you have to pay for. If you have teenage boys like we do, this is a problem. - The pool is large by only park hotel standards, it is also very shallow. There is a slide that is small and slow - good for little kids. So, for preteens and up - a little boring. - Don't believe that the hotel is green and cares about the earth. For example- They throw away all the plastic card keys. When I asked the clerk about that, she said they can't recycle cards because it would take too long - they have hundreds to thousands in one day. I then watched her bend them and throw them in the garbage. I have seen many hotels put the same cards through a machine and in seconds they have reprogramed them. What their problem is, I don't know. Think about what this is doing to our landfills and oceans. Some hotels are willing to put their signs in the bathroom about not washing towels to save energy - why? because it saves money. But the real issues behind the scenes are ignored. - Star Services - ? what is this? The only time I deal with any bad employees was when dealing with star services. It sounds like this is where you get the best treatment, best employees. On check out - we dealt with them and felt like we were again in a fleabag motel. So although during our stay we were happy, at checkin and checkout, we were left with a bad taste in our mouths. Would we recommend it ? I don't know, you decide.

Had a Garden View room; having previously stayed at PBH, I was hoping that the rooms would be on par with the size of the rooms at that hotel. Unfortunately, the room was smaller than expected and the bathroom TINY!! I was not impressed with the furnishings or decor of the room. Looked shabby and the furniture looked worn. Definitely over priced! We obtained the room using points but will never pay the price to stay there. When it came time to crawl under the covers, you can imagine my surprise when I turned back the sheets, only to find black shoe prints on the sheets!! I really don't think they had changed the sheets from the last person b/c fresh sheets should not have these markings. Called the front desk, requesting housekeeping to come up and change the sheets. ONE HOUR later, and four requests later, someone showed up. I thought it was terrible that I had to call 4 times to get someone to address the problem. Not good service Hard Rock! We lost one piece of luggage en route and was told that our bag would be dropped off at the baggage hold area of the Hard Rock, once it arrived, Fine; informed the guys in the baggage dept and they made note of this. I did a daily check with them and, no baggage. On the third day, I checked once again and they told me, to my face, that no bags had arrived. Imagine my confusion when I checked the phone messages in the room and was told that my bag was dropped off earlier that day!! Called the desk again and told them that my bag was suppose to be there. Fortunately, I spoke with someone who was alert enough to remember that the bag was dropped off and waiting for me. I told him that the guys who are responsible for watching over our bags told me that it didn't arrive?? So, moral of the story: don't totally trust that your bags are really being watched b/c my bag was sitting there for hours and they had no clue that it was there. Thank God no one got to it before me! Now, to the positives: the grounds... amazing! The pool... to die for! The Kitchen.... THE best food i've ever had in my life and the staff, wonderful!!! Out of everyone at the hotel, the food and beverage staff are the best! You have to eat at the Kitchen b/c you might never experience the likes of it again.

I can't help but gush about this place - it makes the hotel worth going to. The staff are just wonderful and so friendly and helpful.

I've spent the past hour reading reviews of the Hard Rock, and it's nice to know I'm not entirely crazy. The place IS great.. Yep, it's expensive. I'm surprised that so many people would even think of spending two weeks in Orlando, period (there's other stuff in the rest of the country, and it's less expensive, less sweaty and more educational). Orlando is a diversion and little more. But if you're going to Orlando, by all means stay at the Hard Rock for at least a couple of nights and enjoy all it has to offer. Don't plan to actually \"swim\" in the shallow pool; do plan to hear lots of tasty \"classic rock\" and even the occasional Ramones or Hives song (bless you, anonymous Hard Rock programmers). The slide is fun; get wet and laugh about your back hair, and then order a cocktail. Don't waste your money on the underwhelming Palm Steak House, which is an extension of an overrated and overpriced franchise here in New York. \"Kitchen\" is the better option, but it's also expensive. BUT WAIT: You are at a really nice hotel that's a world away from your real life. The incredible 3D Spiderman ride is a 10-minute walk away, and you won't have to wait in line to ride it yet again (me: 19 times so far). So pay the money and have fun. Just don't waste it at Palm, and think about bringing bagels and cereal to save some breakfast cash. My husband and I have enjoyed two 3-night stays at the HR, and we're looking forward to going back there two days from now. First stay (we were an extended-family party of 15), it was merely excellent and trouble-free. The second time there was a bit of confusion since we came a couple of days later than the rest of the family, and they sort of gave our room away. That sucked for about 2 minutes, then they offered us an entire hospitality suite -- the place where the richer and more famous throw their parties -- for no extra money. So we had a full (non-stocked, until we went to the liquor store) bar and kitchen, surround-sound stereo with actual speakers, a few couches and a poker table that sat twelve people. It was much bigger, and nicer, than our apartment. Our nephews still think we're special because of that room; a minor hotel mistake turned into a major family triumph. Those folks really know what they're doing. This time around we are surprising my sister and her family, who are there upon our recommendation. I spoke to the front desk tonight, asking them not to spoil the suprise, and they were more than accomodating. That's what made me start reading, and now writing, this blog. SO, here's the deal: Rooms are somewhat shockingly nice. Staff really is beyond reproach (at least so far). One can walk easily to a bunch of fun rides, pick his favorites, and ride them over and over again without waiting in line. They're gay friendly, hillbilly friendly and pet friendly, and they're very good at diverting the attentions of the children who made you show up there in the first place. For the childless with some extra cash and an affinity for amusement parks, this is THE place to go. Your beloved will love you even more after a short escape here. If you hate children, or puppies, or rock and roll, or fun in general, this is probably not the place for you. For the rest of us it's top-notch. PS i can't recommend the Spiderman ride enough.

Drinks, food, etc are not cheap but the quality is good so we didn't mind. 18% tip is automatically added. Some people have complained about that, we found it convenient. Only thing that really ticked us off was the charge to park your car! - Staff. Whoever called them rude or unfriendly must have really caused a stir and wound them up because during the 2 times we've stayed in the past, all of the staff have been wonderful, especially the lovely guys at the Beach Club. - Noise/Music - It's Hard Rock. Get a grip! Surely when you book to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel you expect an atmosphere and some noise. We loved it! - Room Quality - No issues. Nice and clean, great ipod docking station and flat screen TV. Really modern feel. We had great views of the gardens. Only complaint was the trek to the room. It's a bit like a maze.

Check-in was fine ( stated I had joined as a leows member a fortnight previous and was given a choice of gift, but no upgrade) Room was fine but carpets/ furniture a little marked bed comfy and bathroom good size with vanity area.Housekeeping also was sometimes a little touch and go IE had to request coffee/ sugar but no real problems. The room also had a mini bar which we did use a couple of times but decided paying 3 dollars for a can of coke was not on so we went on to I DRIVE and bought them there. The hotel has music playing throught the hotel ( except the corridors) and this was fine. Had a couple of Cocktails at The Velvet Bar. Pool was great with good slide , beach area and Pool towels and if you wish Cabanas to hire. We ate ot the Kitchen a couple of times once for Breakfast and once for Dinner. Both excellent. Staff were very friendly and atttentive. Also ate at the Palm Restaurant( special occasion) but can not say this was one of our best meals on holiday as we had ordered quite an expensive bottle of wine(130.00 dollars) which the server had difficulty opening. She then got her duty manager to take over who in turn came back with the bottle open ( we did not see this happening) Refused this bottle as cork could have entered but this should not have been presented back to us . Meal also was mediocre. As in previous reviews the hotel is expensive but you prepare for this. Front of line access at the 2 parks is without a doubt a Major Plus. Paying to self park is a major gripe and rightly so. Leows should address this especially if like us you are there for a fortnight. Only one other complaint HRH is pet friendly and I knew this before I booked.During my research into the HRH I was under the impression all pets and their owners were allocated rooms on the 1ST floor ( we were on the 3RD) On returning one afternoon dog barking was heard coming from the next room. I suffer from Asthma/ Allergy to Dogs , cats, and other animals and was horrified as I had informed my Travel Agent of this condition and they were to request Non Smoking/ Pet Free Room.I proceded to inform reception but first of all I spoke to conciarge who states this is correct it should only be 1st floor for pets. and possibly this person had smuggled them into the hotel. NOT SO.This couple and their TWO DOGS had been allocated a room next to ours. Reception said we could move rooms -US THAT HAD BOOKED A FORTNIGHTS STAY AT A PRICE!!! .Couple with dogs were there for 2 nights. Declined offer but informed reception that many people could have severe reaction to Dogs as I have if in close proximity. Overall apart from the Dog situaltion the HRH and its Sister Hotels which we also visited and ate there are faboulous. Would definetly stay stay there again.

We are a young couple (25 and 27) and our pre-requisite for a hotel in Orlando was a fun environment which was not entirely child focused. The hotel certainly provided this but equally, I believe it would be perfect for families. It is exceptional for Orlando in that it can provide a great holiday for singles and families alike.- I know that the disney hotels are all about the kids! We met loads of parents who were chilling out at the bar while their kids were within sight, watching the evening movie in the pool. The hotel offers a very high calabre of service and the general experience warrants its 5 star reputation. However, this standard is coupled with a chilled out and casual environment, resulting in guests being entirely relaxed. I think this hotel encompasses everything Orlando is about and delivers it with on a 5 star plate- it is fun, lively and chilled out yet luxurious. Staff were all wonderful and extrememly friendly, food and cocktails were superbe and music at pool was great. I just don't think you could be in a bad mood at this hotel as its so fun (without being cheesy)!!! We wondered across to Portofino- it also looked wonderful but I believe Portofino caters for an entirely different spec. It is very peaceful and relaxed and there is a lot less going on than in Hard Rock. If you are looking for a more tranquil ambiance, I would recommend Portofino over Hard Rock. We are also Scottish and wanted to feel like we were in America. Hard Rock is a represenation of the US culture unlike Portofino, which has the Italian novlety. Only bad point is that after 2 weeks in the hotel and an extras tab of $4000, we were charged $200 for a 2 hour late check-out. I thought that was bad customer service given the circumstances and length of our stay. That unfortunately left a bitter taste in my mouth but without this individual situation, our expericence would have been entirely positive. The hotel is a little greedy- its very expensive for food and drink (compared to the other hotels and rest of Orlando) and everything certainly adds up!

Not to worry, however, there was all the difference in the world. We booked our Club Floor room throught AAA and received two free seven-day tickets to the Universal and Islands of Adventure parks, since we stayed at least four nights. At $409. per night the price is definitely steep but when you factor in a real four star property, the free Park tickets, access to Club 7, and a three minute walk to immediate entry to all the Park attractions, it doesn't seem so bad. With temps near 100 every day the room key express entry feature was worth it's weight in gold. We took one day and rented a poolside cabana to cool off from the heat and decided it was a great buy. The cabana we chose was a new one with no TV (we chose this to keep the grandchildren in the pool) and a price of $50. for the day. With a large ceiling fan, a dining table and four chairs, and two chaise lounges it made for a very comfortable break, especially with poolside lunch and drinks service. The quality of the food from room service, Club 7, and the Pool were high quality and reasonably priced for a resort. Our room was decorated in a quirky and fun style, spotlessly clean, with turn down service and fresh towels every night. The extra perks on the Club Floor are a special treat...a welcoming tray of homemade cookies and ice cold milk at check-in, little favors for the kids every night at turn down (much nicer than chocolates), and free water and sodas, continental breakfast with pastries and fresh fruit, canapes and crudite at cocktail hour, as well as complimentary beer and wine. Of course, I can't forget the fresh cookies, cheesecake, and pastries at bedtime!

Everyone seamed to love their jobs and it showed. Even one of the bartenders said it was a great company to work for. I stayed on the 7th floor which you needed your room key to get to that floor. There was a club room with drinks and snacks, tv and chairs where you can sit and relax. I like that a lot. We stayed in room 7124 which had the perfect center view of the pool. The room was very nice and modern, with a flat screen tv, ipod doc, dvd player, play station, computer with keyboard. The decor was so hip. But who even needed any of that when you could go out to the beautiful pool where they had it set up like a beach, I thought I was on an island somewhere. They had the music going. The activities was fun. I even won the hoola hoop contest for adults. But the best was taking the water taxi to Universal, Island of Adventure and City Walk. You could even walk it is 5 mins to everything. I loved the fast pass that made it all worth the money. You don't have to wait in the long lines just show your room key and you go through another way. The first thing you should do is buy the neckalace that holds the fast pass for $5 it is worth it...just put it around your neck and you don't have to worry about digging for the key and it also makes a great souvinour. I also liked the fact that you can use the facilities at the other two hotels. One day we went to one and the other day we went to the other and stayed at the pool and ate.

I loved this vacation and I am a picky traveler. We ate at the Bob Marley restaurant. The food was excellent. The only thing I didn't like which had nothing to do with hardrock, is that after 9:00 pm you couldn't take the kids out to dinner because all of the restaurants turn into night clubs and they wouldn't let us in unless you are 21 and over which sucked because we wanted to stay at the parks until closing and then get dinner but we were stopped at the door. I thought this was suppose to be a kid friendly place. We didn't eat at any of the restaurant on site because we bought the meal deal at the park where you can eat at participatating restaurants.

I traveled with my husband and three boys 10, 7, 6. This was our first trip to Universal Orlando as we are usually loyal Disney World guests. We originally booked our stay at the Portofino, but at the last minute changed to the Hardrock as rooms (with Florida resident discount) became available. Boy am I ever glad we changed resorts. Although the Portofino is beautiful in every way and everything seems to be first class all the way it did seem to be a bit stuffy for a family with three young, active boys. The Hard Rock fit our bill to the tee. We loved the huge lagoon style pool. My kids enjoyed the waterslide. I liked the poolside restaurant service. The wait staff was VERY attentive. We never had a problem getting a beach chair. Plenty of towels were offered at the pool area. The staff had organized games for the kids in the pool area as well as nightly movies. My kids LOVED watching the movie from the pool. The rooms were very roomy. We did have to get a roll away bed for my son. Once we folded it up and put it against the wall; it was like it wasn't there at all. The bathroom is large and had a place for all our toiletrees. They had an honor bar which we didn't open. They had a nice coffee pot that we used every morning (we brought our own coffee from home although they do supply decaf and regular coffee in the room.) We liked the ipod docking station and the flat panel TV. The beds are queen in a double room which is a nice plus. We ate in \"The Kitchen\" restarant three times. Twice for breakfast and once for dinner. All three meals were good. We had the breakfast buffets both mornings. It's a bit pricey at $16.00 per adult ($8.00 for children) but it included beverages...and the food was good. I recommend the asian chicken salad for lunch or dinner. It's a huge salad...big enough to share..for sure. Definitely try the ice cream parlor downstairs. The prices are reasonable and it's the best ice cream we've had in a long time. We liked the short walk from the hotel to the parks and City walk. We took the boat once and enjoyed the ride. With wait times and all it's quicker to walk. The Hard Rock is the shortest distance to the parks than the other three resorts. It took 5 minutes to walk to the entrance of Universal Studios and 10 minutes or so to walk to the entrance of IOA. We liked that we had the ability to charge everything back to the room and took advantage of the package delivery service. Anything you buy will be sent back to the resort ready for pick up the following morning. The best perk of all...by staying at any of the three Universal Orlando Resort properties you and everyone staying in your room gets the Express pass. Basically you can go to the front of every line. For shows such as \"Twister\" not only do you go to the front of the line, you also get let into the building before everyone else! It's a real VIP treatment. Because of the Express Pass we were able to tour both parks in one day. We literally walked onto every ride with NO wait. I can't imagine tour Universal without this pass. The regular lines were VERY long. I can't say enough about how wonderful this hotel is. If you are looking for an outstanding compliment to your Universal vacation sstay at this hotel. If you want a Disney Resort comparison?? I'd compare it to the Beach Club.

First problem we encountered was that we got on the elevator with other people and everyone started selecting their floors. My room was 1114, so we are looking for 11th floor, but 7 is the top. We take the elevator back down to the lobby and ask them where we go? NOTE: lobby is actually the third floor. Our room was on the first floor. It is a little confusing when you get off the elevator on one because the sign points to the gym, pool, water taxi etc. After wandering around a bit, we finally found the room. It was a nice room, beds were great and the television got lots of channels. Ate dinner the first night at \"The Kitchen\". Food was good, but expensive. Rest of stay was pretty uneventful until after we checked out. Because my room was paid by a third party, we had given them a card to place the $100. hold for incidentals. We charged our parking and dinner which came to $104. The hotel placed two additional charges to cover the additional $4.00, one charge for $6.00 and a charge for $407.!!!!

Forget it - $40 per person per day. (That's on top of the park admission) Then we learned that if you stay at one of the 3 Universal Resorts you get express access as your room key is also an express pass! The nicest part of the perk was that the first thing we did when we got up on Sunday was went to the Hard Rock for \"Pre Check In\" where, even though you don't get into the room right away you get the coveted express pass! We didn't expect them to have our room ready right away but they called my cell phone within an hour to tell me that our room was ready for us. The staff were terrific. We were there for the parks so we were not in a hurry to return to the room. The rooms by the way are LOVELY and I travel significantly for work and have come to be very discerning about where I stay. The bedding was supreme. The pool area is great (although there are tons of little kids) and there are activities all day long. We got a very decent rate as we are FL residents - but the express passes alone, which would have been $240 for the three of us, made it worth every penny. You do have to pay to park at the resort but you would have to pay anyway at the parks. The walk to the parks from the Hard Rock is a beautiful landscaped path that in 5 minutes has you at the Universal Studios entrance or Citywalk. You can also take a(free) shuttle or the water taxi but its so close the walk is perfect unless you have kids that would like the boat ride.

We were given our room keys (the all important requisite for the Express line in the parks!) and told we would be phoned once the room was ready. 5 minutes later we were walking through the wonderful grounds to the parks. 15 minutes later my husband and daughter were riding the Hulk coaster! Hotel called while we were riding Jurassic Park so I called them back and they immediately confirmed our room number and said they looked forward to seeing us upon our return from the park. Room was great. We'd booked a deluxe room (2 queen beds and a sofa bed) and there was PLENTY of room for the four of us (two adults, daughter 13 and son 6). Pull out sofa bed was very comfortable, according to my son! Tasteful colours, ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cd player/radio (we got a complimentary cd at check in), cordless phone, coffee maker. View from the room was overlooking the front entrance and gardens but weren't disturbed by noise from cars coming or going at all. There was some noise from the corridor, but no worse than many other hotels. Bathroom was small, but perfectly adequate and spotless. Additional washbasin and dressing area just outside the bathroom made it easy for everyone to get ready on time. Ice machine on our floor was not working and within 5 minutes of reporting it, someone appeared at our door with a bucket of ice. When we walked past the machine on the way to the elevator approx 45 minutes later, the machine was working fine. Bell hop who brought our luggage up suggested we might like more towels as there were four of us in the room - he said he would arrange this and sure enough 15 minutes later a pile of fresh towels were delivered. Every time we walked through reception throughout our stay if Rachel was there she greeted us by name and stopped for a chat. Dinner in The Kitchen (complete with Scooby Doo!) was great - they mixed a special virgin cocktail/smoothie for my daughter - and the memorabilia around the place is great fun to investigate. The Velvet Lounge was a ideal for an evening cocktail to wind down at the end of the day. Kids loved the ice cream parlour too.

Family of 4 (girls 11 and 13). Mixed feelings about the Hard Rock. It is a first class hotel in most respects. Check in, check out, concierge, bell hop, etc. all up to standards. Requested a high floor, quiet and this was superbly granted with a room on the 6th floor at the far end of 2 hallways from the single elevator bank (don't worry, these are the fastest elevators I have ever seen in a hotel of any size). The room had windows on 2 sides because of the end unit whch gave it nice views and extra quiet sharing only one wall. It was very clean and nicely appointed. Nothing to complain about. 2 queen size beds, not fulls like the Marriott does in the same price/class hotel. It was a longer walk back and forth from the elevators but worth it. Grounds are well kept; however, the general pool area gets a bit ratty looking by day's end, especially since many people apparently don't feel any need t o pick up after themselves. You see this everywhere today but more so here. I believe it is a product of the rock n' roll atmosphere here. The hotel can get somewhat \"rowdy\" in terms of noise in the hallways but perhaps to be expected at a Hard Rock. Pros: short walk or boat ride to the parks and City Walk, express pass for the attractions cannot be beat, nice fitness room, many activities for kids and live entertainment at the pool on Sat. night as well. You can also use the facilities at the Portofina Hotel if you wish, Cons: $3 for a grande Starbucks in the Marketplace and self-serve to boot. Breaks a record for me by far. All restaurants very expensive, pay for Internet $10/day, pool side specialty drinks start at $11, shallow pool depth (my kid's complaint) but good slide, difficult self-parking esp, for $12/day, and as noted above, the general pool area becomes a bit of a mess by late aftenoon with not much effort to clean it up.

They would have enjoyed it more if there were other kids to play with. It's very pricey at $12/hour per kid plus $12/dinner so we probably wouldn't use them again.

Did we stay at the same place? Hopefully they have changed a few things in a year, BUT they accept pets, which is great, but our room smelled so badly like cat pee. When I called to be moved, 7 hours later they sent someone to \"clean\" the carpet. Anyone knows you can't clean cat pee out of a carpet. Since we were busy from the moment we arrived with2 other families and multiple children, it wasn't until the next day I asked to be moved. They told me I would be downgraded in the room class without any compensation. A $300/night hotel room that smells like cat?? That said, how about the rude wait staff at the restaurant next to the pool (we waited 60 minutes for our food at 8 pm when the restaurant was 1/3 full - no apologies). We ended up eating there 4 times for the convenience and only once was a waiter pleasant as opposed to condescending. The skinny, tatooed and pierced girls serving drinks at the pool also had a such a sunny attitude that they had to add a tip to our $17 tab! We purchased the meal plan for the kids which was horrendous. We were supposed to feed our 3 kids chicken fingers and french fries for 5 days? The park food at Universal is bad enough. Not only is the Hard Rock very expensive, I suppose paying for all the cool paraphenalia on the walls, but the food and drinks were outrageous, even for vacation prices. Our friend paid $14 after a tip for one \"rail\" margarita. Frozen drinks by the pool are upwards of $10. All 3 families that we were with felt gouged. The one nice thing we all remember is the poolside entertainment for the kids. The comedian was great. Also the proximity to Universal cannot be beat. We also bought tickets to the \"private party\" concert. It happened to be Boston. Once again, very deceiving. It was purely for single locals, serious meat market. They sold us on emails saying \"free cocktails and hors'dourves for the first hour, the band in a private setting.\" It was a singles bar, filled with people looking to hook-up from the Orlando area. Not a fun place for 3 couples, and the lines for the \"free cocktails\" took 20 minutes. FYI management: I wrote a lengthy commentary (when asked by the hotel) when we returned.

We could not open a piece of luggage and about 4 bellhops helped out until it was opened. They were funny and cheerful and I knew they really enjoyed their jobs. The coffee pot was missing in our room and one was brought ASAP. They also brought me tea bags. One day the newspaper was missing and within 5 minutes we had another. The Hard Rock is so close to Universal. The walk is beautiful and easy. The best part is using your room key for the Express line at the parks.

We now have stayed in all 3 Loew's resorts in Orlando. We like Portofino Bay the most, but that's another review. I'll start with the good things about our stay. My self, hubby and 10 year old son stayed for two nights. We had a waterview room on the sixth floor. The room was plenty big with two queen beds, new carpet, a table with two chairs, a flat screen TV, Honorbar and coffee maker. Two sinks (one in bathroom and one outside) was a nice to touch to get everyone ready on time. Had drinks at the Velvet Bar and was very satisfied with the service. Pool area was very clean. Now for the not so good. Ladies bring your own shampoo and conditioner. The hotel toiletries were awful. They do supply a hairdryer (not the crappy kind attached to the wall) We dined at \"The Kitchen\" for dinner and it was not very good. Pizza was not cooked all the way and steak was way over cooked. Service at the restaurant was not good either. After being at the park and going on many rides we decided to take a break and go to the room for a little while. We arrived at the room at 3pm and it still was not clean and no fresh towels. Called for service and they said someone would be right up. Left and came back at 5pm and still no service. Called again and they said the same thing as last time. Finally at 5:50pm someone came to clean the room and bring fresh towels, this was however too late for us to take showers due to dinner reservations. The biggest reason to stay here is to get in front of all the lines at the both theme parks. All the rides were a 45 minute wait for the regular line and for hotel guests with the express pass we always waited less that 5 minutes. If you are not going to the Universal theme parks stay at another hotel. There are lots of other great 4 and 5 star hotels in Orlando both in Lake Buena Vista area and International Drive, but if you are going to the parks then one of the three Loewe's hotels is the way to go to avoid long waits for rides. If you are going to the parks we ate at Finnegan's in Universal Studios and Mythos at Islands of Adventure and were really happy with both choices. Great food, atmosphere and service.

Check in was almost instant - none of the problems which I have read on here. We were given a room on the 4th floor, and considering it was the cheapest room you can buy, it was massive - pleanty of space for the two of us, two large double beds and a very spacious bathroom, with an extra sink. It had been recently rennovated and included a large flatscreen TV (American news rules!) The room was exceptionally clean, and was serviced every day with fresh towels, and Hard Rock Hotel soap (which we 'stole' a few of). No complaints with the room whatsoever. The staff were extremely friendly - much friendlier than UK staff - always smiling, and wishing you a nice day, and very knowledgable of the area when we asked where the nearest shops, restaurants and Walmart were. I didn't use the pool, so I can't really comment on that, though I did see ducks swimming in it in the morning - apparantly not a rare site. They came right up to us too - how sweet! The room keys were like Willy Wonka's golden tickets - show them in the parks and you're whisked to the front of the line - on the Hulk ride, we literally walked straight into the seat of the rollercoaster - literally didn't stop walking until we were sat. The longest we waited in across both parks was 10 minutes on Men in Black - but this was only because it had broken down! These cards are worth the price of the room alone. Perfect in every way - almost. There was only one slight hiccup which could have been a lot more problematic than it actually was...basically you can use your keycard to buy products in the park (and have them sent straight to your room so you don't have to carry them round the park) - to do this, they charge your card $300 to do this (just in case you do a runner I guess). We declined this service, but they still charged us. If we didn't have the money we would have gone overdrawn and could have been pretty nasty. We noticed this on our bill and questionned it. They admitted it was an error and apologised for it. This is the only fault of the entire trip, but it wasn't enough to give it any less than five stars for excellent.

It's definitely a \"cool\" hotel, with great decor, music, and rock memorabilia. The Kitchen restaurant is a good place and surprisingly reasonably placed for a resort restaurant. The very best feature of the hotel is the fact that your room key allows you to skip lines at the theme parks. This feature is not offered at Disney hotels, and it really makes the Hard Rock, Portofino, and Royal Pacific Resort stand head and shoulders above the Disney hotels. We've stayed at both the Hard Rock and Portofino, and we liked both a lot, for different reasons. Portofino is more picturesque and charming, as it seeks to re-create the village of the same name on the Italian Riviera. Hard Rock is \"cooler\" and more kids-oriented, and it is very close (5 minute walk, max) to the theme parks and CityWalk Orlando, with its fun restaurants and vibrant atmosphere.", "Date": "November 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Paltz, NY", "Title": "\u201cWhy do most people complain?\u201d", "Author": "Ctcope", "ReviewID": "UR6081502", "Content": "First off, let me tell you that I am a frequent user of Tripadvisor. Anytime we are traveling to a new destination I will check the reviews. I have found that you need to read the reviews carefully and filter out the ridiculous complaints. Unfortunately, most people like to complain about everything. If the vast majority of the reviews are negative, we will avoid that particular hotel. The Hard Rock was excellent. Some of the prior reviews talked of dated carpet and bedding, which could be true in some cases here but it wasn't like the place was a dump. The carpet in our room had some wear and tear showing, but it wasn't awful. While we were there, they were beginning to shut down wings of the hotel for new carpet, painting, etc., so this shouldn't be an issue once the renovations are complete. Prior reviews also talked about the hotel being so expensive. We chose to book a club level room which came with 4 park tickets for 5 nights. The cost was $330 per night but that also included the breakfast and evening appetizers, beer and wine. The upgrade cost about $90 per day, so the true cost of the room was around $240 per night. One of the other reviews mentioned that they would stay at the DoubleTree instead. I checked out the cost and it was around $200 per night with 2 free tickets. You would then have to take a shuttle to the parks and lose the front of the line access you get staying on site. Other reviews have mentioned it, but this feature alone is the greatest reason to stay on site. Unbelievable! We rode the Mummy 5 times in a row, sitting in the front row, and never had to wait more than 3 minutes. So I'm not sure what people are thinking when they say it is expensive to stay. I guess if you can find a motel for $70 per night, buy 4 unlimited 2 park passes averaging $25 per day, pay $12 for parking, a family of 4 would pay around $180 per day and save $60 over the Hard Rock or $30 or so over the Royal Pacific. It doesn't make sense to me. We stayed on site and walked to all the parks, came back in the middle of the day and went to the pool, then walked back to the parks later in the day. More Positives: Check In: I asked for an upgrade and got one. Check in took a little while, but I can't believe some of the reviews when they said it took 45 minutes. The people at the desk were great and I was more than willing to stand there for 15 minutes to be upgraded to the family suite, for free. Music: other reviews complained about the music in the lobby and elevators as too loud. We loved it, when you got on the elevator at 8:00 in the morning and had rock songs on your ride down, you were pumped up for the day. Proximity to Parks: easy 5 minute walk to the front gate of Universal, 10 minutes to Islands of Adventure. Here's the negatives: Club room- not bad, but not worth the $90 per day to upgrade. The breakfast was really the only deal to be had. We may have covered our $90 extra with breakfast, appetizers, and drinks on some of the days, but not all. Pool Cabanas- the club room allowed us to get poolside cabanas for 1/2 price. I found that we only used them a couple hours a day and many days we would get there and a storm would roll through and close the pool. Take your chances and try to grab a chair instead of spending the $60-$120 to get a cabana. Pool- It was a little shallow but my 11 and 9 year olds thought the underwater music was great. The adults have to go towards one corner where the water was around 4 feet deep to actually swim, otherwise you could just sit on the bottom with your head out of the water. Food/Drinks- expensive but expected at resorts. It's not like the Hard Rock charges any more than any other resort in the country. We checked out the 2 other hotels while we were there as well. The Portofino was beautiful, but it is pretty far away from the parks. You would have to use the shuttle boats to get to the parks if you have kids or if you have been in the parks all day and don't feel like walking another mile to get back. The Royal Pacific is closer to the Island of Adventure, about the same distance as the walk from the Hard Rock to the Universal gate. We are going back in January and are staying at the Royal Pacific. We are going for the least expensive room and it includes 2 adult passes for $209 per night, (not sure why some people will still say this is expensive). We found that the view from the room means very little to us. We were out of the room by 8:30 in the morning, came back to change for the pool, then returned to change and go out to dinner. We didn't spend much time in the room so the view meant very little to us, not worth the extra $30 per day to get a water view. Being veterans of Disney, we really enjoyed the experience here. Our kids loved the Hard Rock and Universal. We don't go into vacations looking to find something wrong with the places we stay. These are upscale hotels with all the amenities you would want, great restaurants, and front of the line acces which can't be undervalued. I hoped this helped most of you, read the other reviews carefully and decide if the people complaining about waiting at check in, a stain on the carpet, noise from kids in the hall, music too loud, pool to shallow, drinks too expensive, etc, need to lighten up and enjoy their vacations.

I have stayed at many properties around Universal and Disney, some very good and some that were horrible. Always remember a vacation or trip is what YOU make it, as a business traveler I experience \"bumps\" along the way almost every trip I make (30-40 trips a year). Having said this I will proceed, The Hard rock is a wonderful hotel full of energy and music. If you have teenagers, they will love the place, if you are bringing grandma and granpa, they will probably hate it. If you are looking to save money, stay somewhere else, IT IS Pricey. I hate when people complain at the price of cokes, food, parking, etc., when they book a room at $260 dollars a night. HELLO??? If you pay that much for a room, do you really think everything at the hotel is going to be cheap?? Also, people complain about the noise??? It is the Hard Rock Hotel, at a Theme Park with kids, kids, kids, did I mention kids?? This is not the Best Western on some deserted highway in Arizona. The Hard Rock is downtown at Party Central, this place does not go to bed until late, if you can't handle it, it is probably best you stay somewhere else. I will now address other issues that always seem to come up about the Hard Rock. 1-Checkin in-Do not expect to get into your room before 4:00 pm, it is probably NOT going to happen. Drop the bags and go to Citywalk or the parks. Everyone gets wound up when the room is not ready when they show up-Here is your warning, it is going to happen, now get over it. 2-Price-It is expensive to stay at the Hard Rock, the food and drinks are high and you will be charged for parking. There is bottled water in the room, if you drink it, they will charge you. Funny, no one ever mentions the tag on the bottle saying the price of the water and that they will charge you. Those tags that are on every bottle of water from all the hotels around the USA must just Magically disappear at the Hard Rock. 3-Noise-I once read a review where a woman complained about all the noise and that they were having a concert in the LOBBY of the Hard Rock Hotel....Hmmmm... ever heard of \"Velvet Sessions\" that happens every month at the hotel. That is part of the draw at the Hard Rock to see famous musicians around the hotel and in the restaurants. 4-Rooms-Yes the reviews are right, the rooms are getting a little shabby due to high traffic at the hotel. But, the hotel's rooms are currently being renovated and each new renovated room features flat screen TV's and docks for the IPODS.Nice.. 5-Pool-Very large pool with great slide and underwater speakers. Pool bar is great, drinks are high. To summarize----After reading this review, I'm guessing most are asking why stay at the Hard Rock??? The rooms are expensive, food and drinks are expensive, you have to pay to park, the rooms are showing age, it can be loud and there are kids running everywhere. Express Passes..........:)...:)...:)....:)LOL...LOL...LOL This is the key, the magic pass, the big Kahuna...the whip topping..OH Baby...OH Baby... Take a hour wait at a ride and do it in less than 2 minutes, walk right by all the poor suckers waiting in line to ride Spiderman, Hulk, Jurassic Park, Mummy, etc.,in 100 degree heat, all sweaty and grouchy with whiny kids complaining about waiting all day to ride a ride. You know,,, sometimes I almost feel guilty about jumping to the front of the line....NOT!!!!! Let's do the math, the express passes you buy in the park are around $35-$40 dollars a day per person and you get to ride each ride ONCE. So we have 5 people,, 5X$35.00=$175.00 plus the cost of the Holiday Inn across the street at $129.00 plus tax. Basically you are better off to stay at Universal's properties because the Room Key is you UNLIMITED express pass. This alone makes all 3 Universal Hotels worth their weight in GOLD.. I hope the review will shed some light on the Hard Rock Hotel..Remember, all Hotels have problems and most will try to make your stay as comfortable as they can, have a open mind and don't let little blunders ruin your trip. I hope you and your family enjoy Universal and Islands of Adventure as much as we do, if you liked this review, I also submitted a review on Universal Studios and tips around the park a month or so ago.

Enough time to chicken out but not if you get on it within 10 minutes. Anyway the hotel was certainly impressive. The rooms were large and it was good to have 2 wash basins to use in the morning. The buffet breakfast is taken at the \"Kitchen\" and cannot be faulted. There is even a low level servery for children although the plastic plates are of the prison style! Didn't put my youngest of helping himself to the smily face potatoes. Breakfast set us up for the day and we did not savour lunch or dinner. There is an ice cream/smoothie parlour which is excellent. Something for child and adult alike. It is open late so a nice place to drop into on the way to bed. The pool area is clean and my eldest son was impressed that as advertised music was indeed to be heard beneath the waterline. A nice touch is on Sunday evening when the hotel holds a \"swim in\" cinema. Something of a novelty to enjoy sitting in a hot pool or jacuzzi and enjoy Toy Story 2 being projected outside. There is a vast amount of dining places to visit at Universal Walkway which is easily accessed from the hotel and again the hotel chargecard give you priority booking. After a hard day on the rides it certainly helps to get a table fast though sadly my children were usually too tired to go anywhere in the evenings. The rock music played around the public parts of the hotel is unobtrusive and is really quite pleasant even to a square like myself. Lots of rock and role artifacts which could be tacky but aren't. In truth the whole hotel had a real vibe to it. Having visited the film set style Portofino Italian resort i doubt if the other 2 hotels have as much soul as the Hard Rock. Returning to the hotel from Disneyland was a great relief and one felt rather superior staying at the Hard Rock rather than at one of the Disney hotels. Probably only one gripe. One had to pay $6 per day for the use of the gym. Essential to work off the breakfasts. Considering the class of hotel I thought that the food bill was very reasonable. One of the porters told me that the rooms are about to get a make over this month which will include large flat screen TV's in every room. The idea is to make the place even more like a rock stars abode. The Hard Rock Hotel certainly rocked me and my children's world. We shall not hesistate to hang by when next visiting the area.", "Date": "September 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cOverall, a great hotel\u201d", "Author": "bluepulsar", "ReviewID": "UR5723685", "Content": "Stayed 25-29 August 2006 and this was our 2nd visit. Check in fast, efficient and friendly. Asked for room upgrade as I'm a Loews member and was upgraded to pool view room which was on the 6th floor. Chilled wine and large portion of nuts delivered too (Loews benefit). Room was attractive and large with a great vanity area with a big curvy backlit mirror. It was a little tired but refurb is coming soon and really the tiredness wasn't that noticeable. This hotel has a very strong rock music theming, yet manages to convey this theme with humour and real style. The music is played in all public areas all day and I really liked it. The public areas are smart, grand and tastefully done. The pool area is magnificent - a real tropical oasis. I did have two problems. The main one was banging, scraping and hammering coming from the room above me which was very intrusive on our last day. I complained to 'star service' who said they were renovating the room above me and the noise would stop between 7 and 8pm, however it did not stop until 10.15pm. Then, at 7.10 am I was awoken with the noise starting again. I complained again to star service, and said I felt a 50% concession on my last night's rate would be fair compensation. I expected them to bait me down or refuse this, but instead they called me back and said they had sorted this for me! I think that was impressive service and I was satisfied with this outcome. The other problem I had was a burger arriving medium rare from room service when I'd ordered it well done. They delivered another one (and fries) with sincere apologies and a basket of fruit by way of apology. They were totally forgiven! Like everyone says, the theme park express benefits are brilliant. The walk to the parks too is really pleasant with a meandering path by the canal with loads of interesting tropical plants, many of which are labelled. I wanted to give them an excellent rating, but because of the noise I couldn't.

Me, husband & three children ages, 15, 13 & 12. We stayed in a club level room. Everyday had breakfast in Club Lounge, saved time & money. Fresh Fruit, bagels, muffins, cereals, pastries, drinks. Snacks throughout day available. Dinner had three hot items & cut veggies, wine, beer & soft drinks. Late night desserts snacks & drinks, mini canolli, brownies, blondies, etc. You save so much money. We ate lunch out but for the most part the offerings in the lounge were fine for us. Everyday we would each get a bottle of water before heading out. In the parks you will pay between 1.69 & 2.50 per bottle. We would get more water when we stopped in during the day and again at night. We also saved money at the parks restaurants and shops by using our AAA card for a 10% discount. Even when we went to lunch outside of Wet N Wild the restaurants gave us the AAA discount. We arrived on 8/16 at about 12:00 and our room wasn't ready but they let us go up to the club lounge. Cold drinks and snacks. The consierge made a call and within 15 minutes we were able to go to our room. We made reservations for the 5 of us and there were only two queen beds in the room. We were told at check in that they only have 3 rooms that have the sleeper sofa and we would have to pay $25.00 per night for the cot. I complained that we booked the room for 5 and should have a room that sleeps 5. I contacted my travel agent at Liberty Travel and they contacted the hotel and made sure we did not have to pay the additional money. I would only go to Universal & IOA if I stayed on site or bought the express pass. We rarely if ever had to wait in lines. The most would be 10 minutes. Some rides would say the wait was 40 minutes, and we just showed our room key and you are shown a separate entrance and get to the front of the lines. This also worked for us at City Walk. We went to Margaritaville and there was a 45 minute wait for a table. I showed our room key and they said they would cut the time in half for us. We sat within 15 minutes. We had the tickets for Universal, IOA, Wet N Wild and Sea World. My favorite ride was Men in Black in Universal, my husband and son loved Spiderman at IOA. My girls' favorite ride was the Mummy. Shows were great. You also had preferred seating showing your room key. Loved Fear Factor which we saw the first day. Thankfully we saw it then since it closed after that until Halloween. Our rooms were always clean and ready for us when we returned around 4:00 for a break. Turn down service also was nice, getting clean towels, and little gifts for the kids at night. We usually just walked back and forth to the parks from the hotel. Less than 6 minute walk. We took the boat a couple times, since it was right there. If we had to wait we just walked instead. There was a free shuttle from the hotel to Wet N Wild 10 minute ride and to Seaworld about 20 minutes. We took a cab back from Wet N Wild since the return shuttle was later than we wanted. It cost just $6.00 for the 5 of us. One last thing. My husband loves Pink Floyd. Hard Rock Live had a group playing in concert Pink Floyd's albums. He loved taking our son to his first rock concert. It was really a treat for them both.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis", "Title": "\u201crecent stay\u201d", "Author": "drtwnbys", "ReviewID": "UR5623985", "Content": "we just returned from the hard rock and had a nice time.

We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and I cannot tell you how we loved it. The people that work there no matter what they were doing were amazingly helpful. The day we checked in we had adjoining rooms and one of the rooms smelled of smoke and they not only gave me my money back for that room, they moved me to a better location and with no effort from us. They moved the luggage and everything while we were at the park. The easy access to the park was the best feature. We walked to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventures and City Walk in less than 5 minutes. We were able to bring a small cooler with bottled waters for my 4 boys and it was a great savings. The hotel also gives each person there own room key which is used in Universal to cut the line. We never waited more than 15 minutes for a ride even when the wait for the regular lines were 1 hours or more at times. We were amazed how quickly we were able to finish both parks. The hotel also has a shuttle that takes you to Sea World which was a great convenience not to drive after a long day at the park. The rooms were spotless and we ate at The Kitchen twice because the food was so good and never had to wait for a table. Another thing we liked about this hotel is that we decided to stay by the pool one whole day to relax and we rented a Cabana that had a TV and refrigerator, an overhead fan to stay cool plus a table with chairs to eat or just play games. The staff would walk around and hand out ice cold towels so that you could cool yourself off. The restaurant by the pool was also very good - we ended up eating lunch and dinner there as well.

We had a few problems - the toilet became blocked and this was sorted out immediately, but the door did not lock properly and this was not sorted to our satisfaction throughout our stay. We did not eat at any of the restaurants but took a quick and cheap breakfast each morning at the take away shop. This was very convenient. The pool was nice with a great slide for the youngsters, but the incessant loud rock music made it difficult for any one wanting to read!! The main advantage to staying at the Hard Rock is that you are able to use your room key as an express pass at every ride.

Despite booking and prepaying nearly six months in advance for a club room, they couldn't find us in the computer. Took nearly half an hour for them to find our reservation. We weren't offered any compensation for the aggravation. Not even a bottled water. We were starving for lunch at the time. Not overly friendly staff. Once up in the room, it is standard fare. Nothing spectacular. Don't expect to be awed. I won't pay extra for club floor again. The food is standard holiday inn continental fare. What was horrible was fighting the other animals for food. People can be extremely inconsiderate. Nothing like waiting behind some cow in the coffee line who insists on filling and fixing five cups of coffee at a time. And best that ye get to milk and cookie time early because the hordes will snatch up a dozen cookies at a time, leaving none on the plates. Upsetting for my nine year old to see adults acting like this was the apocalypse and grabbing everything edible in site. And forget ice cream night. People were struggling to scrape that frozen mess out of the tub for ten-fifteen minutes at a time. I walked out on that fiasco. In summation, I would stay there again but not on the club floor.

The walk was about five minutes or the water taxi came pretty often and they had bike taxis for tip only if in a hurry and to tired to walk. The express pass in our opinion is the only way to go never waited more than two to three minutes for the rides, some we got on right away; the show type rides maybe fifteen minute wait. We have stayed Royal Pacific before and it was nice too. We are in our forties and grew up and still listen to rock n roll and so does my eleven year old so we enjoyed the atmosphere and all of the memorabilia at the Hard Rock. As far as the club level we enjoyed the convenience of it and the staff was wonderful and we enjoyed hanging around during happy hour talking with other folks. If you have a several kids its money well spent just for breakfast and all the drinks during the day and evening, for us it was just a nice perk.

I do get a FL resident discount, so this does have an effect on my outlook I am sure. Pros: - Immaculatley clean rooms. I felt comfortable enough to go barefoot and relax in bed. I am VERY picky, too. This place is very clean. (Unlike many tourist hotels in the area) - Very nice and modern features. There is a CD player in the room and they give you a mix CD to play. - Large bathroom and large tub. Large vanity area with all the necessities. - Wonderful lobby with several dining options and a club called Velvet which is nice. Velvet has a great balcony overlooking the pool. - You can walk to Citywalk and the Universal Theme parks. Very beautiful walk. - The Express pass to everyride, anytime, all day. I cannot stress this enough: THE EXPRESS PASS IS UNQUESTIONABLE - YOU MUST HAVE IT TO ENJOY THE PARKS THOROUGHLY! Would you rather wait 45 -90 mins at each ride in the sweltering heat, or just cruise on in as many times as you want? Staying at the Universal Hotels or purchasing the pass for $35/per person/per day is the only way to get them. I am telling you that you must have them! - The pool is just gorgeous! It is HUGE with a really fun slide. The great thing about the pool is there is always space to be alone if you are out for a restful sunbathing session. There are 2 hotubs and a huge bar. Sometimes a calypso band will play. Cons: - Theme park prices on the food and drinks. I just love this hotel! You get what you pay for. This is a very clean, gorgeous hotel that has great benefits. We won't stay anywhere else. I have never paid more than $199/night, just book in advance and check surrounding dates, it usually works out. Tips: Margaritaville has good drinks and is fun. Okay food. But you must go! Bob Marley's is a great place to have some drinks and dance. The inside is open to the sky! Hard Rock Cafe has the best fajitas ever. You can stay out as late as you want, since you can just walk back! And there are security gaurds all the time so don't worry =) And if someone in your party gets tired, they can just go back 1st and not drag you with them! I hope this helps to convince you to stay....you will have a great time here. Walking to the parks and the Express pass will totally make your vacation!

I have never pd. under $300/night at this hotel. Another reviewer complains he had to pay to park his car???What is that about?

If you want a quiet time, this place may not be for you. There are lots of kids here. It is a family place. Kids are loud and they do run in the halls..sometimes late at night...sometimes early in the AM. You also have the 20-30's crowd that come in at 3 AM...They are often loud, too. Lastly: It is FUN. There is a great pool with a BIG water slide for the kids...THE KITCHEN which is a yummy restaurant, and they have room and pool side service as well.

They have a lounge/bar for the adults which is very trendy and full of good looking, well dressed 20-30's somethings...

Don't forget to ask for the inflatible guitars for your children, my sons loved them. We stayed in a garden view room on the 6th floor.

It was a lot of fun to watch the movie, swim and eat nachos and chicken fingers while hanging around the pool. We ate at the Kitchen twice, for dinner and breakfast. Both meals were great. My eldest son loved the kids dinner buffet. My youngest son loved the grilled cheese sandwich. The seafood chowder was fantastic.The blintzes were the best I have ever had.

My family loved Emack and Bolio's. I especially appreciated having a Starbucks in my hotel. How convenient. We ate at the Beach Club several times. The food was good but your food and drinks will come much faster if you go to the bar yourself to place your order. The hotel definitely needs to hire more staff in this area. My husband and I ate at the Palm twice. On both occasions the service and food were very good. The servings are very large. I loved the crab cakes and surf and turf. The steak was wonderful. We never had room for any dessert which looked huge. My sons visited Camp Lil Rock twice and loved it. They especially loved a staff person named Macho. Camp Lil Rock has a big screen tv, arts and crafts, games as well as 2 or 3 computer stations. It was very clean. My sons both said it was better than the kids club on the Disney Cruise ship.

The pool water was warm and clean but on several occasions there were plastic cups floating around. Please note you can only bring inflatible balls into the pool. The lifegquards that we spoke to were all very nice. The cleanliness of the pool area was our only disappointment but nothing in life is perfect.

It was lots of fun. We took the water taxi 3 times after visiting Islands of Adventure. I think our longest wait was 10 minutes. The waiting area is covered. The water taxi drivers are hilarious. One gentleman told the boat riders jokes, another one sang Minnie the Moucher (?). We used our rooms keys all the time to get to the front of the line, bypassing long lines with waits ranging from 20 to 60 minutes. If you are visiting Universal I would highly recommend the HRH. It's a beautiful hotel with very friendly and accomadating staff. The room key is an amazing perk with or without a special room rate from the annual pass or the automobile association.

I was surprised to find that we were treated very well by everyone. First of all, let me say that if you are wavering about staying at the hotel, it is worth it. The room key is like gold at both Universal parks. Using the Express lines at each ride or attraction made it possible to do both parks in one day, even during Spring Break week. We were able to do it all, then decide what was worth doing again and again. For my impatient 9 year old son, this feature made it worth the extra cost of the hotel. Also, the Hard Rock Hotel is the closest of the 3 hotels to the Universal parks. It was a quick 5 minute walk to the front gates of Universal Studios and the City Walk, and 10 minutes to Islands of Adventures. Being able to head back to the hotel midday for a break and a swim, then head back later for more rides, was wonderful. My 13 year old daughter enjoyed the movie night in the pool on Friday night after sundown. I don't know if that is a nightly occurence. We just went to sit in the hot tub that one night. Rooms were adequate. I liked having a separate sink area outside the bathroom, and another sink in the bathroom. We had two spots to brush our teeth and clean up. I used the coffee pot in the room, but was happy to find a Starbucks in the City Walk on the way to Islands of Adventure. The biggest surprise for us was the level of service we received from the hotel staff. My son became very ill after our first day there. The concierge gave us directions to a nearby walk-in clinic, and even mentioned there was accomodations to get us there if we needed a ride. Later on, the emergency services staff called to check up on our son and see if we needed anything. Also, when a toilet clogged in our room, a hotel maintenance worker came quickly to fix it. When our remote control seemed low on batteries, they were quick to bring a new one to our room. On our last day, with our son still really sick, we requested a later check-out than 11am. Not only did the guest services employee tell us we could check out late, but she even asked the manager if we could have even more time due to my son's condition. I didn't ask for that. She called back to let me know that we could take our time checking out. I don't know if it helps that I tend to assume people want to help me, and am pleasant with them. My husband tells me that is why people are nice to me. I think the key is to ask for what you want as nicely as possible, and to let them know why you want or need it. We never ate at the hotel, so I can't give an opinion on that. There was a young woman making rounds in the pool area asking if we wanted a drink. One irritation for me was how loud the music played in the pool area. I would have preferred quieter music around the pool. After being at the noisy parks, a little peace and quiet there would have been nice. Given that it's the Hard Rock Hotel, they blared music all around the pool. The towel service was nice. They had a group of employees directing games for younger kids, which seemed to be a hit. The sand beach by the pool was nice, but made for sandy pools and hot tubs. All in all, staying at the resort is pricier than staying close by, but the convenience to the parks and access to the Express lines made it worth it for our family. We would definitely do it again!", "Date": "March 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property\u201d", "Author": "TexasTandE", "ReviewID": "UR4728166", "Content": "This was a great property and the staff is awesome.

Breakfast was great - lots of pastries, coffee, fresh fruit, yogurt, bagles and cream cheese. The daytime snack consisted of a bowl of pretzels, but there are sodas and waters available all day. The afternoon happy hour was great with 2 hot munchies each evening and other things like cheese and crackers and veggies. The sweets at night were store bought cookies - usually oreos.

The pool and Beach Club restaurant are also wonderful. The water taxi leaves every few minutes to transport you to City Walk where you can either hang there or walk over to Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios.

We splurged for the club floor, where we could rent cds and dvds for the room, and where there is complimentary food through the day--that added to the stay! The concierges on the floor were also terrific--they got us restaurant reservations, confirmed our flight home, etc. The hotel pool, complete with underwater speakers, was great in the afternoon. There were lots of other \"older\" children there as well, so my son even made a few friends. The food at all of the restaurants on site was also good--and the service was great. The hotel is a quick walk to both Universal parks and Universal City Walk. We could easily visit a park in the morning, return to the pool in the afternoon and go back to the park in the evening. The highpoint however was that your hotel key allows you to go in the \"fast line\" at the Universal parks. With this we never had to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes for any ride.

Our car was always waiting after calling the valet at the Hyatt; at the Hard Rock be sure to call at least 1/2 hour before you need it. In addition, at both hotels we had adjoining rooms for our children. At the Hyatt we couldn't hear a peep from the other room--at the Hard Rock we could hear everything through the walls, so I guess that hints at the quality construction.

Rooms are beautiful but not huge. We were told there would be room in the small fridge for our drinks/snacks but the fridge was packed with their pricey items so we bought a cooler. My 12 and 13 year old sons loved the hotel and memorabilia. My son actually brought his guitar and was dying to play quietly in the huge lobby - hoping to get discovered I guess but he didn't in the end. The pool area is gorgeous. I was surprised at how many small children were in the hotel. I thought it would have more older kids/young adults there. As noted elsewhere on this site, the corridors were very noisy. There were tons of young children running up and down the corridors until real late at night - midnight??? We were on the fifth floor. My husband got on the elevator once and just as the doors were closing a couple of young kids reached in at the last minute and pressed the alarm bell! So beware for over-indulgent parents with more money than sense and bratty kids. We did not complain about this - but it does seem to be a problem. I had registered as a Lowes loyalty customer and had requested local newspaper and beer/nuts for our loyalty gift. It wasn't there but a quick call to the front desk brought it within an hour. We had no delays checking in (around 5:50 p.m. Friday night). The boat to Universal was very convenient and we used it every time. Most was a 10-minute wait but hey, it is beautiful out and we were on vacation. The front of the line access at Universal was very good. However, beware of the Mummy Ride!!! I hate scary rides and roller coasters and this ride looks pretty unscary from the outside - you can't tell it is a roller-coaster type of ride because it is all hidden inside the building -- but my 12 year old son and I got on it and we were terrified. We felt we barely escaped with our lives. We should have known when we were asked to lock up all our belongings in lockers before getting onto the ride. I lost my sunglasses and the face of my watch on this ride. We did not try the restaurants at Universal - chose to go off property so we could get the International Drive experience. Warning - try to avoid driving this at night - the traffic is crazy and there are too many pedestrians. As a result of eating off-property when we came back in at night the self-parking was full and we had to park in the valet parking. My husband was worried that our car would be towed so he called the front desk and they said it would \"probably\" be okay. It was okay - no ticket or anything.

This year we stayed at Universal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hard Rock Hotel\u00c2\u00ae from 3-7 January 2006. We booked our four night stay in the middle of November 2005 in order to take advantage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Family Free For All\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offer. This limited time offer, which was available from November 2005 through February 2006, was a great deal as we got free Universal Studios\u00c2\u00ae theme park tickets for two adults and two children and the two infants went free. We booked online and planned our vacation by visiting the Universal Orlando\u00c2\u00ae Resort website at ----. The only condition attached to this deal was that you stay four or more nights at one of the Universal hotels so we chose the Hard Rock Hotel\u00c2\u00ae. This deal also included free admission to Universal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CityWalk. Although the room rates at the Hard Rock Hotel\u00c2\u00ae are significantly higher here than most Walt Disney World hotels and many of the hotels on International Drive, there are many advantages to staying onsite. The most notable advantage of staying onsite is the Universal Express ride access. Hotel Facilities: The Hard Rock Hotel\u00c2\u00ae at Universal Orlando Resort is a AAA Four Diamond Award winner and is managed by Loews Hotels. This rating is equivalent to a British or European Four Star / Luxury hotel. The hotel offers an interesting mix of rock music themed entertainment and visually perfect surroundings. The architecture of this hotel is in the style of a California Mission and is reminiscent of The Eagles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hotel California album cover. The hotel features a number of rare rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122n roll memorabilia throughout the public areas rumoured to be worth in excess of one million dollars. The hotel also boats a large heated swimming pool with a great water slide and underwater audio system. Other facilities included a fitness center, steam room, sauna, whirlpool, onsite Hard Rock merchandise store (very expensive), game room, shuffleboard, life-size chess/checkers, volleyball, supervised children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activity center, four restaurants and several lounges all of which were beautifully designed and immaculately maintained. Dining: We did not try all of Hard Rock Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants and lounges. The main reason was the high cost. The Kitchen was great but we did not manage to catch any legendary rock star cooking their favorite recipe for us. The Beach Club bar and restaurant were great! The waiting staff here were very patient, friendly, polite and helpful. Overall the food in the Beach Club was great but a little expensive. Nevertheless we dined there most nights. The Marketplace area was disappointing. The variety and quality of the food on offer was below par. All they had on offer for breakfast was muffins (three varieties only: blueberry, chocolate chip and bran), regular and decaffeinated Starbucks coffee and a few varieties donuts!!! However, staff members in the Marketplace were very friendly and polite. Hotel Location: The location of the hotel is perfect; it is right next to Universal Studios (5 minute walk) and Islands of Adventure (10 minute walk). The CityWalk entertainment Complex is only 5-7 minutes walk from the hotel. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like walking or have mobility problems, complimentary on-site transportation is offered via water taxi or shuttle bus. The best perk of staying at this hotel is Universal Express ride access. You just show your room key card and bypass the regular lines at your favorite Universal Orlando rides and attractions. You do not need to purchase the Express Pass or get ride reservations. We did not wait in line for any of the attractions. Another perk is priority seating at select Universal Orlando restaurants although we did not use this Rooms: Our room was a standard garden view room (375 square feet) with two queen size beds. The room was on the ground floor and featured a color TV, stereo with CD player (you also get a free Hard Rock Hotel music CD to take home with you), 2 dual-line telephones, voicemail system, data port, internet access, coffee maker, safe, two sinks and a hairdryer. Our Experience: The Pros: Staying onsite is great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a real bonus. I admit that the heated swimming pool at the hotel was fantastic. The pool is very clean and the kids loved the slide. The staff working in the Beach Club bar and restaurant were great! They were very friendly, polite and helpful. The Cons: I regret to report that we experienced quite a few problems during our four night stay. Although the room was spacious and comfortably accommodated all six of us, we felt that it was not cleaned very well. The carpets were really dirty. We had to keep asking for clean bath towels as the bath towels were stained and dirty. The poolside towels were cleaner than the bath towels!!! We had an infestation of ants in our room but the management were not very quick to deal with it. On our last night we had problems with noisy hotel guests who had just checked into the hotel. There was a huge national building convention in the new Convention Center. This convention started on Saturday 7 January 2006 but many of the attendees of this convention started checking into nearby hotels including the Hard Rock Hotel\u00c2\u00ae the night before. Some of the convention attendees were not particularly well behaved and because of all the noise they were making and their drunken behavior we had to call security to deal with it. Unfortunately the hotel management and security did very little about this problem and we got no sleep at all on our last night at the hotel. This adversely affected our enjoyment of the last day of our stay. In summary, we may have saved over $400 by taking advantage of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Family Free For All\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offer but we got a dirty, and ant infested room and noisy neighbors. My family loved Universal Studios\u00c2\u00ae and Islands of Adventure and the Universal Express ride access was a real bonus. The hotel was visually very appealing but the level of service was unsatisfactory. I had hoped that $229 per night plus tax would guarantee a clean and quiet room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no such luck!

We ate at \"The Kitchen\" and found the food was pretty good, service spotty. The kids enjoyed characters Shrek and Scooby Do coming into the restaurant. Of course the snack bar and gift shop are ridiculously expensive, but there is a Walgreens within an easy 2 minute drive of the hotel. The water taxi to Universal is a nice service and works well, but this is the closest hotel to the parks, and the walk there is a short one (5-10 minutes) anyway. We waited until the last minute to purchase our Universal park tickets, and ended up getting 4 days admission free through the Universal internet site. The deals change from week to week, and we got lucky. The two Universal parks were ideal for our kids, we spent 4 days there and never made it to Disney at all. The hotel room key - express pass system works like a charm. Our oldest rode the Hulk roller coaster 10 times and usually \"walked on\" with no waiting. The room key supposedly works at the City Walk restaurant / shopping area - - although this was spotty and some merchants wanted your credit cards. The room key works just fine for charges in the parks, which is great in that you are not constantly juggling large bills. Punch a hole in your room keys and wear lanyards for the parks! Ate at Emerils in City Walk - dropped $180 for two people, but it was worth it, believe it or not. Also ate at Pastamore (average) and NBA City (good) and offsite at Thai Thani(good). We toured the Portofino Hotel, which was picturesque, but it is farther from the themeparks, if that is your destination. For a family with kids, we enjoyed the music and the higher energy of the Hard Rock. For your rental car - try digging hard on the Alamo website. We got a great rate, as did the rest of the big crowd at the Alamo counter at the airport.", "Date": "January 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cNickel and dimed to death but still enjoyed it\u201d", "Author": "girlcat", "ReviewID": "UR4366654", "Content": "Though at every turn it seems there's some kind of charge waiting for you, we had a wonderful time here.

We had to literally scream to the front desk staff right in front of us because of the LOUD concert going on in the lobby. We had to sit out in the hall in front of our room for about an hour.

It was great, I'll start with the good points. First, the atmospere is great. The hotel is beautiful, and there is rock memoribelia everywhere. The music is also a good touch, not just the elevator music played everywhere else in the world, good rock. The pool was good, it has a water slide and 2 hot tubs. But it only ranges from 2-3.5 feet and the center is always crowded. The restaurants are great, some are a little expensive, but it's vacation, stuff's always expensive. There was a movie night where they projected Jurassic Park onto a large screen next to the pool. Not exactly a new movie, but a good one. The staff was very nice and we never even saw the maid, but the room was always perfectly clean. And finally the proximity to the parks and City Walk were great, Hard Rock is the closest on sight hotel. Okay, some of the bad things, there wern't many, but they were enough to cost the hotel a point. When we got there, the room was not ready. We had to wait for them to clean it or somthing. But instead of having to put our things back in our car, they held them behind the desk for us. This also gave s some time to tour the grounds of the hotel, so that inconvenience was a bit of a mixed blessing. The Gift Shop/Store is good, but expensive. They also didn't have one of the things my brother wanted, a Hard Rock poker set. They had display models all over, but none in stock. :( Magazines and snacks were also very expensive. Once we finally got to our room, it was okay. However, we got a Garden View on the 3rd floor. We didn;t so much over look the Garden as we did the front over hang for the cars, and the parking lot. But we never really spent much time staring out the window anyway. The boat shuttle service is over rated. It's slower than walking and we ended up waiting for it for a over half an hour once. City Walk is fun, but I don't recomend taking small children to a resteraunt with a band, they tend to turn the music up very loud. Other than that, it was great. The Express Pass with the room cards is a good touch, we rode several rides many times. But the express pass kind of kills the atmosphere that they set up in the line. You miss many of the videos that explain how the ride work, which can get confusing with interactive rides like \"Men In Black: Alien Attack.\" There are also a few thing I recomend doing that we never did. Such as checking out the other hotels, using the gym, and using the Hotel Cards for priority seating in resteraunts. All in all the Hard Rock Hotel is a great hotel.

One strong criticism is the arcade- alot of the games were broken, they charged $1.00 a game (?!?!) and the games were rigged to end early. A total rip off. The rooms themselves are entirely mediocre and showing their age- nothing special here and unjustifiable for $250 a night. The best thing about the Hard Rock is the pleasant 15 minute walk to Islands of Adventure and Universal and Universal Studios and the Express Pass which allows you to effectively cut in line.

Room was clean, beds very comfortable, safe in closet,iron/ironing board in closet,stereo w/cd player,good size tv (plenty of stations w/hbo),good size dresser. I would say room was in good repair, bright, cheery, not what one would say elegant, but nice. Housekeeping was excellent as long as you get lost during the day. If you hang around and are in and out during the day, it seems to mess their system up somewhat. This hotel is really great for families w/8yo to teens. My kids thought it was the bomb. Music is playing everywhere. In the lobby, the elevator, the pool, the whole property just makes you feel like you are 21 again even if you aren't interested. I could have cared less and by the second day it grew on me. The location is the best of the onsite hotels. It has the shortest walk to the parks, less than 5 minutes. Has a short shuttle and water taxi if you don't want to walk. Has great concierge, valet's,front desk staff, etc. They were all very attentive. Though you do find yourself tipping a lot of people. However, I always felt they earned it, they were just that good. This hotel has a starbucks on site, ice cream shop, the \"kitchen\"(a casual restaurant), the \"palm\" (fancy), the \"velvet bar\" great indoor lobby bar hang out, and the beach club outdoor bar hang out. Much more. The pool is always 86 degrees heated, much of area around it is sand, outdoor sand volleyball court, pingpong tables, lots for kids to do at night to hang out. Huge waterslide during the day. Aside from all of that, the front of the line access you get at the rides at Universal parks by showing your room key is worth the stay alone. Take a lanyard so you can punch a hole in your key, put it around your neck, so you don't have to take it in and out of your pocket constantly. Great so kids don't lose theirs too. Also, you can set up adult room keys so you can charge all purchases in parks to your room back at hotel and have pictures and souvenirs delivered back to your room so you don't have to carry them around all day. All bonuses of staying on site. These are perks of staying at the Royal Pacific or Portofino as well. If we go again, I would not hesitate to stay again at the hard rock.

The menu for dinner did look good though. The music at the hotel is loud but if you like rock & roll it won't bother you too much. The rooms were quiet however. The hotel is a bit more expensive than others but you can't beat the convenience to the Universal side of Orlando. You can take a boat ride (or walk) to 2 other Universal hotels and use their amenities or to the Citywalk for no additional charge.

But the front desk said the hotel was full.. so we decided to try and stick it out... at this point I had a terrible headache and just wanted to lay down.. Around 1:30 our neighbors came home >>>> and partied loudly until after 6am.. I did report them and security came up.. that just agitated them so they banged on the wall... I asked to be moved the next day and please let us be in our room by 4... needless to say I had to call again (after being promised they would make us a priority and call.. NOT) They did move us.. to a room with a view of tree tops... Needless to say I was disappointed in the entire stay.. At the rate I was paying a bit of customer service and making nice would have smoothed it over.. but they didn't bother.. and neither will I the next time I visit Orlando..

It had two queen beds and a pull out sofa bed that was actually comfortable. They give you a cool music CD at check-in and you have a nice CD player in your room to listen to it (or the radio). The music playing around the hotel property is at a comfortable listening level and does not over power the mood. We are a military family and although this was slightly expensive we enjoyed our time to the fullest. The Kitchen (hotel restaraunt) has great food but is a bit pricey. We had great breakfasts there and dinner one night. The other nights we ate in the City Walk where prices are a bit less. Recommend the Italian restaraunt there. Your rooom key gets you Universal Express access to all the rides and attractions in both parks. Our longest waits were for the things like Earthquake, Twister and some of the other movie rides. Other than that, we were in and out of the Hulk twice in 30 minutes! Great time and makes it worth the money you spend. The pool at the hotel is great.

It seems that there are pool activities each night - on Sunday night they had a DJ who did some fun stuff (family oriented) with the kids and adults. Really made it for a pleasant day.

With an impatient 10 year this was great. Ate one time at Universal Studios Monster Cafe and had a great pizza, would recommend.

We walked to the parks the rest of the trip. The hotel was great, we arrived at noon and had no wait for our room. Suggestion is to register as a Loews club member, you get a treat of your choice delivered to your room which is a nice treat and it is free. We stayed on the club level and if we return and I would not opt for this choice, a little over priced for what you get. Basically you get a continental breakfast(bagels and fruit) and there is evening snacks that are not worth the extra $$$. Even though I would not stay on the club level again, another benefit is soda and water available all day. I would stay on a regular floor and drive over to one of the local stores(5-10 minute drive) for snacks and liquor(Walgreens has a liquor store beside it, ask the help desk how to get there). At the hotel we only ate at the pool side resturant and all in all it was pretty good. We took everyones advice and did not eat at the Kitchen. We did talk to some other guests that had and their impression was the same as others, not worth the $$$. The pool side drinks were expensive, although good, so I would suggest getting something at the Walgreen and mixing your own. We did venture to Wet n Wild and were very dissapointed, long lines and overcrowded. There are alot of kids at the Hard Rock, which we loved since we had kids of our own. They have one night of a big screen movie you can watch in the pool. That was pretty cool. The last couple of years we have taken a cruise and gone to Cancun so had some concerns because we went to Orlando a few years ago and stayed at a Disney resort and left very dissapointed. This vacation was the best vacation we have had in the US. The kids rank it up there with the cruise we took last year. I would definitely recommend the Hard Rock and we plan on returning the future.

The NEGATIVES: -poor lighting in the bathrooms -remote controls did not work well unless you were 2 feet from the TV (we noticed it in our first room and with both TVs in our upgraded room) What else can I say? The positives DEFINITELY outweigh the negatives. Yes, some of the food/drink prices were high at the restaurants on site, but what can you expect anywhere in Orlando??

Our room was not ready and we were told would not be available until 4 p.m., so we ate lunch at the Kitchen and went over to the park and then came back. The walk to the parks is very nice - quite short, and beautifully landscaped. It was very convienient. When we got to our room, our bags were brought to us pretty quickly. We had a cruddy view - the roof of the building - but since we had gotten upgraded we couldn't exactly complain. The room's bed was the nicest hotel bed I've ever slept on! And the pillows were MUCH nicer than the usual hotel pillows. The room was good sized and had a couch to sit on. The best features of staying at the Hard Rock: 1. Express Passes for the rides...without a doubt worth the price of staying on site! My husband commented that it spoiled us on any other amusement parks we will ever visit in the future. We literally walked right on several rides without breaking stride. 2. Closeness to the parks and City Walk: A very quick and easy walk, and they even have a water taxi if you want to bother waiting for it. We tried it once but it took 20 minutes and we could have walked there 3 times over in that amount of time. 3. FANTASTIC pool area. White sand beaches, two hot tubs, a great slide, and just overal nice. We rented floaties ($10 apeice for the whole day) and spent the whole afternoon at the pool one day. It was so relaxing! The pool resturant and bar was really expensive - $8 for a tiny margaretia was a bit over the top - but it was convienient. The only complaint I have about the Hard Rock was that the resturant service at The Kitchen was hideous. We ate there for dinner and we waited 20 minutes for the server to bring us a desert menu after we requested one. It was soooo slow! Plus they seated us outside in what felt like the middle of the sidewalk with people constantly walking right around us and staring at us. The other complaint is that we wanted a fridge but it was an additional $15 a night to rent one. At the prices we paid for the room I think a fridge should be included for no additional charge.

We also ate at Emeril's and Emeril's Tchoup Chop restaurants and highly recommend both of them. The Kitchen at the Hard Rock was great for the breakfast buffet but otherwise the service was horrible and the food for lunch and dinner was mediocre and not worth the price. Between the 3 hotels, I would recommend the Hard Rock or the Royal Pacific. The Portofino may have nicer rooms but it feels very deserted, almost like a ghost town compared to the energetic vibe at the Hard Rock. The Royal Pacific is very nice from what I saw.

You can easily do in one day what it would otherwise take two or even three days to do if you had to wait the posted wait times for each ride. There are no limitations on how many times you can use it or how often... so I would recommend VERY highly that you stay on-site. We chose the \"middle-of-the-road\" hotel, and stayed at the Hard Rock. The Hard Rock Hotel itself was great - There were three of us (2 adults, 1 seven year old) and we stayed in a king room which also had a fold out couch and plenty of room for everyone. Check-in was smooth, everyone was very friendly. We checked in first thing in the morning and they took a cell phone number and called us at the park when our room was ready. Housekeeping was great, and the only miniscule inconvenience we experienced with our room (a missing TV remote) was taken care of within 2 minutes. The pool is probably the best part of the actual Hotel, especially if you have kids who like to swim. It's shallow enough (deepest part is 4'8\" I think) so that you don't have to worry much about smaller kids who might not be strong swimmers, and the water slide is enough to keep most kids happy for hours on end. We didn't eat there, but the prices at the Beach Club seemed really reasonable for a place of this caliber. There is a down side to the place, and I think most people have mentioned them here before. * They do have a knack for nickle-and-diming you to death once they have you there. * $7 a day for parking ($14 for valet) gets tacked on immediately upon check-in, which seems a bit much for a $300/night hotel. * The minibar police have a tendency to ignore the \"Privace Please\" signs that you hang on the door, barging in at 9:00 (our room was on the 1st floor, maybe higher floors got to sleep later) whether you want them or not. * Food prices are pretty absurd, particularly at the carry-out place on the pool level. (Emack and Bolio's I think it's called - $26 for 3 bagels and juice.) But if you go on vacation expecting to spend money for conveniences and such, it's not enough to make it a bad experience. It's just that when you pay nearly $300 a night for a hotel, it's a bit chintzy of them to wring every cent out of guests while they're there. Ultimately, I'd probably try one of the other Hotels on-site next time.

We were a couple of hours early but we were allowed to check in and were promised a call on our cell phone when the room was ready (the official check-in time is 4:00). We went to the Islands of Adventure and by 5:00 we still had not received a call. We stopped back by the front desk and were told the room had been ready for a while and the girl just laughed when we asked about not receiving a phone call. Also, as a result of ineptitude at the front desk my credit card was rejected at a restaurant the next night because the check-in person had \"accidently\" charged about $20,000 in room charges to the card. It took two days to get it resolved and they never even appologized for the error except to say it was a typo. The room is not worth the nearly $300 charge. It is small with a small bathroom that you have to squeeze next to the toilet to get the door opened. The toiletries are sub-par and the decor is nothing to write home about. The maid service, however, was excellent. The grounds are nice, though not Disney quality. The pool was very nice and the kids enjoyed the slide tremendously. The restaurants are very expensive with only so-so food. As another reviewer said, go to the grocery store before you get there and bring a cooler to put drinks in.

We found the hotel to be very clean -- carpets were fine. I think some of the past reviewers interpreted the subtle shading as dirt. We even saw them shampooing the carpets while we were there. The staff was very friendly, professional, and helpful-- top notch. Our room was truly one of the nicest we have stayed in -- and we have been in a lot of hotels. Everything was clean, new, amenities were great. Here's your tip -- We had a Loew's First Card (free if I remember correctly) and the upgrade to concierge level was $50 instead of $100 per night. Just make sure you tell them you are a member; they won't offer unless you ask. You will get a newspaper every day and some other free stuff, too. There are even better benefits, like free room upgrade, the more you stay at Loew's hotels. I think there's information on the website... Here's my beef(s) 1. The hotel is sorely lacking in sundries -- magazines, toiletries, sunscreen -- the things travellers need. The only items available were in the back of the Hard Rock merchandise store. A tiny little section, with things like individually wrapped aspirins. And you will not find a good store anywhere else on the entire Universal properties -- I looked. 2. We have stayed concierge in many hotels and it has always been a quiet, quality experience. Not at the Hard Rock... There were more people in that small lounge than in the lobby! People sleeping, unsupervised kids in pajamas running through tipping plates of food on the carpet ... the whole gamut. I got the feeling that some of these people had crammed 20 into their room and were using the lounge as overflow. Most times we could not find a seat & wouldn't have wanted to anyway. The food was just OK... I think it was because it was such a free-for-all that the hotel decided to put out the \"bad stuff\" or the \"unwieldy stuff\" to cut down on the gluttony. Many times it was as if a swarm of locusts had descended. The worst was the night that someone had set up their child's birthday party in the concierge lounge. They had balloons, party favors, and the food was... evening cookies from the lounge! They took big plates of them for their party, leaving store bought Oreos for the rest of the guests. I guess concierge is still better than buying food at the hotel ($13.00 for two cokes and a bag of chips), but it sure wasn't the treat that I am used to. Note to HRH: Consider having a family level and also an age 15+ level of concierge service. Or limit the age that can say on the concierge level, and the number of guests per room. Note to self: Ask driver to stop at a grocery store before checking in. The extra transportation costs will be dwarfed by the savings in bringing your own sundries and snacks.", "Date": "March 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, but...\u201d", "Author": "natsfan62", "ReviewID": "UR3292015", "Content": "Very nice hotel...beautiful.

We went with our 13-year old son, who for the most part, preferred staying by the pool- trying to catch lizards and using the amazing waterslide (by the way, it's fun for us adults too)....instead of going to the parks. The amazing part is that since you're so close, you can have some down time in the morning just to relax by the pool and get in some Florida sun- no rush to get to the parks early because they are in such proximity to the hotel- just a 5 min. walk or water taxi- in addition, with the express passes, we were able to do the Mummy Ride 3 times in a row in the time it took most families to ride once- TRULY INCREDIBLE- and worth the money if possible. This certainly isn't a cheap place by any means, but for us, it was the Disney trip of a lifetime, and worth all the extra amenities for sure!!! The service was also amazing!! Staff was Always willing to go the extra mile. While we were there, we enjoyed one of the velvet sessions where they have a rockband from the past come in and perform- as many of us 80's buffs remember well- the Romantics performed for us. The HRH did an amazing job transforming the hotel lobby from the luxury of a 5 star hotel to a hip rock-star party-like atmosphere. It was also great for our son because as we sipped on Martinis and beer, he was close by at the pool and always in close reach, which was such peace of mind for us. The whole experience was amazing, and I hope that we are able to return very soon!!!! The final thing worth mentioning is the MUSIC!! After all, this is the hard rock- I heard songs the whole week that I haven;t heard in years... In my opinion, the constant music is perhaps the most under-appreciated aspect of this hotel- it really adds a flare that makes you never want to go back to ultra-snooty places like the Grand Floridian- after all, this is a Florida vacation, and especially with kids, the whole point is to HAVE FUN, and the HRH succeeds this measure beyond all expectations :)", "Date": "March 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cMove over Disney!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3259376", "Content": "We are visiting the HRH in April to celebrate our Anniversay - we honeymooned there as well.

Unfriendly front desk clerk, non-smoking rooms full of smoke (even the valet noticed the smell) and an unhelpful concierge. The trip was very stressful because of this hotel's staff. Upon checking in, the front desk clerk attempted to re-charge me for the first nights' stay in each room that I had already paid for previously (and had documentation showing it). The clerk argued with me for over 5 minutes, then finally relented. When I got to my two club level rooms, one clearly smelled of smoke, even though a sign listed they were \"especially prepared\" as non-smoking rooms. The valet noticed it and said he'd send up an ionizer to help. The ionizer never showed up the first night. Because the rooms were adjoining, by the next morning they both smelled like smoke. I called the front desk and they said they'd send up an ionizer while we were at the parks. When I returned later that afternoon, no ionizer and still a bad smell. I called again, and this time the concierge said she'd personally put one in my room, or they could transfer me to another set of ajoining rooms that were smoking (?!!) After complaining for a few moments, the concierge offered my party free breakfast the next morning because of our troubles-not a big deal since I was already paying for the club level's free breakfast and snacks every day as part of my room price. The ionizer was delivered finally and the rooms smelled better for our last night. Upon leaving I went to the concierge to pick up my rental car-as I had been told to do-(one of the other Universal hotels has a rental car company in the hotel), and the concierge couldn't find my rental reservation. He just simply told me he couldn't help me and told me to go find the valet!!! I have stayed in MANY 4 or 5 star hotels and never have had a concierge tell me he could not help me, then refuse to help. I ended up speaking to the valet, who personally took me over to the other hotel where the rental car company was located, and that hotel's manager and concierge helped me from then on.

Finally managed to get a room booked at $219 + tax for that night (though we were told that we probably wouldn't be able to keep the room that we had and would most likely have to check out the next day if we got the AP rate as they have different rooms for this rate!!!!), and we had to unpack my two younger brothers and all of our luggage from the car, get them to the room and drive back to the other hotel to use their internet access to book up the annual pass rate for the rest of our stay (which was $149-169 per night, with a night free for every 3 nights paid for, so quite a saving on the rack rate). No help was offered with all of our luggage and we had to struggle with it to our room. This room was definately not a 5* standard room, and had a lot of wear and tear. It was on the 3rd floor (same level as the lobby). By the time we got back to our room after booking up the rest of the holiday it was 3.30am. The next day we rechecked in and were asked if we wanted to keep that room or move to a different room, we chose to move up higher, and got room 6131. This room was better that the one on the 3rd floor, so much for nastier rooms for AP rates! The hallways do need sorting out though, and the carpets replacing. Housekeeping were excellent and were the friendliest people there. I decided to use the TV internet, but after it breaking 3 times within an hour and having the wrong type of engineer sent up to fix it (he was for the phones, not the net even though we specified what our problem was), we called down and asked for it to be cancelled and refunded, which it was. Though we couldn't check our folio out for the entire stay as that didn't work, even though we notified them. They do offer internet access in the business centre, but want $10 for 15 minutes. We used the net elsewhere for less that half that price. We had another run in with the check in girl when we took our annual passes down to be added to the booking as we hadn't swapped the paper confirmation for them when we moved room and had been asked to bring it along sometime. My husband asked if it was possible to add the Loews member number to the room, but we were told no as we had a special rate. I said that it was fine (we really weren't bothered), but she kept going on and on and on about how we were already saving $80 off the rack rate and if we wanted points then we had to pay full price and we were getting such a good deal etc etc. We felt like trash. I practically had to shout 'THAT'S FINE!!!' at her for the 2nd time before she would shut up. We might not have been paying rack rate, but we were still a paying customer. We weren't treated like 'royalty' or even like decent people, apart from by housekeeping who were lovely. The front of the line access is great, but I wouldn't pay more that what we did for the hotel. The check in staff and the concierge need basic customer service training ASAP. I doubt if I would stay here again, if I want FOTL I will probably go to the Royal Pacific next time, but only for a couple of nights. 10 nights here was too long but we didn't know where else to go. Perhaps Disney hotels know how to treat the guests correctly. BTW I am not the only guest that felt this way about the staff at the hotel, I was talking to another lady in the laundry room who had a similar experience with the concierge and ended up walking away from him as he was so rude to her. Rooms are nice, the pillows are uncomfortable, bathroom is tiny and you have to really try and manouvre around the bathroom door! Everything costs you extra ($6 for a bottle of Evian anybody?), the barman in the Velvet lounge is really nice. They had Xmas parties on in the lobby at the weekends (well the lounge area was shut off to normal guests), lots of very loud music and really drunk loud people wobbling around, not very nice. There was an ant infestation around one of the jucuzzis, and one morning we walked past the other jucuzzi (around 10.30am) and there were glasses and empty beer bottles scattered around it. Oh, the people that work in the parking security gate bit at the front are really nice, and always welcomed us back in.", "Date": "December 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, super for Universal, but it'll cost ya...\u201d", "Author": "edleo13", "ReviewID": "UR2898355", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Hard Rock Orlando for one night, on December 17th, 2004. First and foremost, the hotel has a wonderful location. Of the 3 onsite resorts, it's the only one within walking distance to both Universal parks. You don't have to deal with boats or busses to get to either of the parks or City Walk. Secondly, using you room key to enter all the Express lines in Universal is well-worth the additonal expense to stay onsite in comparison with the offsite hotels. My wife and I were easily able to cover both Universal parks and ride all the major rides in one day. In addition, the hotel itself is very nice. The rooms (i.e. carpet and walls) are starting to show some wear, but they are nicely furnished and the in-room stereo is a great touch. Bring your own tunes, play the radio, or use the CD they give everyone at check-in. Perhaps the only real drawback on this hotel is that everything, and I mean everything, costs extra. Self-parking is $7. Small bottles of water in the hotel snack bar are $3.15 - before tax! Want to you the fitness center? It'll cost ya. Need high speed internet...$10 more. I realize that all of these things cost money to maintain but for $250+/night in peak season, this hotel should include a few more extras. If the Hampton Inn and their $69/night rooms can include free Internet and workout facilities, Hard Rock shouldn't have any problem matching. In summary, great hotel for getting in Universal. Not worth the additional cost to use as a homebase for Disney.", "Date": "December 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trabuco Canyon, California", "Title": "\u201cA must stay\u201d", "Author": "ocadvisor", "ReviewID": "UR2873445", "Content": "We stayed at the HRH during the busy Thanksgiving weekend 2004.

We never lost power or any services - except the pool was closed early the day of the Hurricane and opened a few hours late the next day due to cleanup.

If you want the mausoleum vibe try the Portifino across the street. We stayed in a club room on the 7th floor, meaning free beer & wine for happy hour, and free food during other parts of the day. This was extremely convenient for our family and well worth the price of the club room upgrade. From our first contact with staff and for 8 continuous days, we were treated like kings, and every request was granted. I could rave on and on about this place - but 2 things struck me as truly exceptional. Being there for a week, we decided to spend one full day just at the hotel (mainly the pool area), and for us it was comparable to the enjoyment we had at the parks. At first I thought the price of a cabana rental at the pool was a waste, but my wife talked me into it so we got the Yellow Submarine themed cabana for a day ($70 which is half price for club room guests) - this made our pool experience wonderful! The cabana acted as our motel room at the pool complete with TV, Phone, fridge stocked with soda and bottled water, Ceiling fan, table, chairs, towels, and privacy tent. and in the evening we had a great private view of the movie which was played on a huge screen poolside (with a fireworks preshow). My kids made tons of friends that day and had a blast swimming, using the waterslide, and playing the organized poolside games. Me and the wife also opted for massages that day a few minutes walk down a beautiful landscaped path at the Portifino Hotel. When we went to that hotel, (me and my wife at seperate times for our massages) we both shared with each other how the Portifino was beautiful, but eerily quiet and dismal over there -- and we both knew we made the right choice by picking Hard Rock. The second great thing is...well, perhaps the most overlooked and underappreciated thing about the place - the music. I heard some great songs I haven't heard in a long time (mixed with new songs). And it isn't the usual 20 songs over and over like the radio - song after song you never know what you will hear next - I only heard one song repeated the entire week. You can tell someone put a lot of time making the play list. The variety of musical genres represented were wide, and the tonal quality was amazing all over the hotel. All over you could see both staff and guests singing to the music -- a great learning experience for my kids! If you are a musician, shame on you if you stay anywhere else in Orlando. Your kind is accepted here! As far as the other stuff goes - our room was beautiful, had a great view (7th floor folks have no problem seeing over the trees) and the maid staff gave us Hard Rock gifts every day. The only tips we gave were to the valet, waitress and bartender (we carried our own bags), and we never got any funny looks for not tipping anyone else. The amusement parks were amazing but stressful, and the cut-in-line passes were a life saver. A lot of people complained about the staff on this board. For those I have this advice...I kind of got the vibe that the staff will wait hand and foot on those who appreciate the culture that the hotel has to offer -- as opposed to looking at the staff like they are overpaid slaves who you can walk all over just becuase you feel you paid too much for the room.

We visited July 25-28, reserving a garden-view 5th floor room. Check-in was no problem, but we had a 9 p.m. arrival. Room was clean, maids attentive to our likes. The first night there we could see fireworks from our window. Express pass by showing room key was very fine! Ninety minute waits turned into 3 minutes.

These are normal amenities that are usually covered at normal hotels. Read the fine print if you don't want any surprises on your bill when you leave! There was problems with the concierge. We had tickets for Arabian Knights, and had to make reservations. I went through 3 different people over 2 days by phone at the concierge desk. I decided to doublecheck them at the desk. Instead of reserving for 2 people they had reserved for 6 and had the first name wrong. I think it would have been better to skip the concierge and make reservations myself. But they finally got it right! (Oh yes, there is a $1.00 charge to make local calls.) We didn't touch the $6.00 water, but brought our own water, cokes and snacks. The pool was guitar shaped, nice if you like to wade, but not very deep. The slide was fun, even for grownups! The sandy area for lounge chairs made pool area more beachlike. The landscaping is groomed and fountains are clean. The hotel was accessible to CityWalk and both parks. We walked some and rode the water taxi when we didn't want to walk. We watched fireworks from pool one night. The sandy area for lounge chairs made the pool area more beachlike. All in all, we had a great time! Going Back? Not for awhile.

We decided on the \"Stay and Play Free\" package. It was $249.00 a night for a standard garden view room and two adult tickets for the length of our stay. We bought our son's ticket online also - five days for the price of two. It was a park hopper pass and the hotel provided us all with express passes. This is a great family hotel! Our seven year old son absolutely loved the music, the pool, and the waterslide. It takes only five minutes to walk from the pool to the entrance of Universal Studios. I can't say enough about the location of the hotel and the express passes! We watched fireworks from the pool one night and waited in line for rides anywhere from a few seconds to 15 minutes. (average wait probably five minutes). Actual nitty gritty on the hotel: We self parked instead of valet after our luggage had been loaded onto a cart. The self parking is close by and half the price of valet and tip free. We also opted for a fridge in our room for $15 a night. Even with the added price, it saved us money on drinks alone. We did not purchase any food at the hotel. We ate at City Walk every day instead. (Use your hotel key/ express pass to \"charge\" things back to your room instead of carrying around cash.) We did swim at the pool and relax every day. The pool is shallow, but a whole lot of fun. Everyone should try the slide! The pool side bar also has drinks with ice cubes that glow in the dark and change color - very cool! (Very expensive - but we pressed the button on the cube to turn off and are still using them at home.) Things to bear in mind with this hotel - it is a family hotel with tons of kids everywhere. The rooms don't have balconies so the view is simply just that, a view. The standard hotel rooms are - well standard. In my opinion, there is not enough room for a 5th person on a roll-a-way bed.

We have 9 year old twin boys and they had a great time. They said it was their best vacation yet! We enjoyed the pool, the music and the kids entertainment was great as well. The Front of the Line Pass was THE BEST. My husband and I agreed that we would never go again without it. The wait times were 1 hour plus, and we never spent more than 10-15 minutes in line tops! You could spend a couple of hours, ride alot of rides, and not feel like you had to hurry through to get your moneys worth. The food at the hotel was expensive, and we found eating in the parks and at City Walk was much more reasonable. The Mythos in Islands of Adventure was wonderful. The front of the line pass also gives you priority seating there, and you have a great view of the park and lake. Food was outstanding! The hotel was clean and the staff was pleasant, although they didn't really go out of their way unless they were looking for a tip. If you are looking for alot of pampering, this probably isn't the place for you, but if you just want a nice hotel, clean room and plenty to do for the entire family, without long waits in line, you'll have a great time. My only major complaint (my kids would disagree) were all the amusement games at both parks and at City Walk. My kids couldn't walk past them without begging to play. At $3-5 per game, this can get costly quick. Not to mention having to carry all of those stuffed animals home on the plane.

We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel from July 17-24, 2004, and booked a \"pool view room\" thru AAA. Upon checking in, we were advised our room wouldn't be ready until 4PM,,, but the staff told us we were welcome to go to one of their restaurants, \"The Kitchen\", where my wife and I,, and our 9 yr. old son could have a $55. lunch; burgers and chicken fingers. Once our room was ready, (room 2124, on the 2nd floor), I opened to curtains to find a beautiful view of trees. Not lush palm trees positioned around the pool, but trees, 30 feet high, right outside my window, blocking all view of the pool. If the wind blew in a certain directions, I could see a lovely blue which I assumed was the water in the pool. I didn't find this out until AFTER we had unpacked. I wasn't moving to another room. As the week progressed, I got madder and madder about the \"view\". After the 3rd night, I commented to the front desk associate thatI wasn't happy with the view. I found 3 breakfast buffett passes under my door the next day. I'll give them an \"A\" for effort, but I would have liked the difference refunded. The grounds are very nice, as is the property itself. As stated in prior reviews from other travelers, the staff is very \"tip-happy\". they expect one for every little thing they do. We found all the employees very competent and gracious. The pool is awesome, as is the water slide. The only true reason to stay at this property is for the front of the line priviledges at the Universal Theme Parks. We saw posted wait times of 75 and 90 minutes on some of the most popular rides (The Hulk, Spiderman, and Jimmy Neutron) and we waited about 3-5 minutes with the room card passes. I doubt we will stay there again. For $250. a night, I think our dollars can be better spent elsewhere. ALL room service orders have a $3. charge AND an 18% tip added.

I'll start with the negative points first: 1)We are generous tippers and agree that people should be paid for their services BUT everywhere you go or every service you request, a tip is expected! This can be costly. We had to tip from the moment we stepped out of our car at the front lobby. Scarey! I wanted to tell some of the staff...LET ME DO MY OWN LABOR AND I'LL KEEP MY MONEY! I felt a little violated considering we paid quite a bit for the room itself and then to have to tip tip tip on top of it. Hmmmmmm............You would think the staff wasn't being paid by the hotel at all. They sure get over well with all the required tips. This would be the biggest reason that I would NOT want to stay here again. 2) The check in process took too long, especially since I paid months ago and had to only get my key and go. The check in person failed to see that I already paid and was going to charge me for the room. I had to tell HER that I already paid which is not good. 3) Reservationist spelled my name completely wrong when I made the reservation although I spelled it numerous times and 4) Although the reservation noted that there would be FIVE people in the room well in advance, we did not have enough towels upon entering the room which meant we had to call someone to bring towels which meant...you guessed it....another TIP! 5) Parking - self park is $6.00 and $12.00 for valet with in and out priviledges. Self parking lot is a walk and not welcomed on a very hot day or after a long, tiresome day. JUST A NOTE: Be careful with valet parking as a tip is expected each time your car is provided to you and dropped back off. Very costly. This is why I opted for self-park 6) I asked the luggage desk to have my luggage delivered to my room as our room wasn't ready at 11:00 am (no problem, we didn't expect it to be - checkin is at 4:00 pm) and the person behind the desk said \"no problem but leave the tip with me\". I found this VERY OFFENSIVE and INAPPROPRIATE to say to a customer/client. I was going to do that anyway but it should be MY DECISION and the person should have kept his words to himself! I did not use the eating facilities or swimming pool (due to time constraints) but they looked nice. Swimming pool was to close at 10:00 or 11:00 but closed early due to rain although I didn't see the point. It was just sprinking but..............that's their call....maybe due to liability issues. I won't count this as a negative as it may be due to safety. Can't knock safety. The advantages is of course the express pass. It was wonderful and I would not visit Universal Studios without it. The location is great if visiting the parks. Room was clean. No complaints there. Beds were very comfortable. Furniture was nice. Bathroom small but nice. No complaints about the room itself and I'm picky about it being clean!

When we got to the pool it was a complete sham. We couldn't get over the water measured along one side actually read 17\"! Is that a normal depth for a pool which is supposedly meant to appeal to the hard rock type of adult vacationer? Our pool at home is much better. My son refused to go in as the very deepest water was one small area of 4 ft. Most of the pool was 2-3 ft. My husband and son are 6' tall and I am 5'8! Maybe they should rename the entire pool area \"A toddler pool\". Everywhere you went to find snacks was way overpriced and a very small selection of snacks. The Starbucks was ridiculously priced--and I'm used to New York City prices!

This is a relatively slow time at the hotel (50% occupancy according to one of the bartenders) and comes right after the end of the very busy tourist season. We had already had one bad experience with \"seasonal burnout\" in an Orlando hotel we stayed at right before we got to Hard Rock, so I was a little worried. No worries, though! We had a great time and service was excellent all the way around. We got in on a Florida resident special ($139 per mid-week night for garden view). This same bartender said that another great mo. for FL residents special is September as they are usually about 30% occupancy and screaming for guests. Join Loews' First club and get some freebies, like your choice of a welcome gift (we got 3 huge chocolate chip cookies and a carafe of milk delivered to our room with a handwritten thank you note to staying at The Rock). Loews First is free and after staying 6 nights you get a free guaranteed upgrade. THe more nights you stay at a Loews hotel the better the perks. You don't pay for using the workout room, plus more. We arrived around 10 a.m. and while we couldn't get in a room, they do allow you do check in and pick up your room keys so you can begin enjoying the express pass right away. They gave us a phone number to call periodically during the day to see if our room was available and it was by about 1 p.m. Rooms are really pretty--beautiful color scheme of soft greens and blues. Very comfortable beds. Clean clean clean as a whistle. The only slightly negative thing I can think of is the room was waaaaay far away from the elevators (only an issue when you get back from the parks and your feet are killing you) and the hallways were FREEZING for some weird reason. HRH is gorgeous, very clean lines beautiful landscaping. I'm a rock fan so I personally loved the music blaring everywhere (if it's too loud, you're too old). Had lots of fun checking out the rock 'n roll memorabilia all over the hotel. Pool area is unbelievably, takes up the entire courtyard of the hotel and my little one loved the slide. Food is pricey but good (mmmm--the S'Mores dessert at The Kitchen) and they serve lots of it. The little coffee shop downstairs serves Starbucks and it is pricey, but what I've never seen published on any review is that you can get free refills during the same day you buy a cup by showing your receipt. Staff went out of their way to be accommodating--my daughter got really sick one night and housekeeping quickly brought up an entire set of linens. I got some weird skin rash and when I asked the lifeguard if they had a first aid station, she called for assistance and half a dozen people (including security, oddly enough) responded. We are so spoiled by the hotel key/express pass system I don't think we'll ever be able to go to another theme park beside UO/IOA and we'll always stay on the property. With the exception of 2 times (20 minutes once at ET which was apparently not running briefly at the time; and Dudley Do Right for 15 minutes because it was like a 90 minute wait for everyone else) we virtually walked on to every ride the whole time we were there. You can easily walk to UO/IOA and CityWalk but take the water taxis on occasion as they are fun and it's a nice ride. Warning: you will love the Hard Rock Store in that hotel and can spend a million dollars in about 5 minutes : ) But hey, what's a vacation for but to go into debt up to your eyeballs.

Both hotels are owned by the same management group, so we assumed that the level of service and courtesy would be equal between the two properties. Let me be the first to tell you, it is not. The Hard Rock is too wound up with its own glitz and popularity to stoop to anything as slow as common courtesy and good service. Our first indication of this was the fact that our room was no where near ready when we arrived at the appointed check-in time. It was only after numerous phone calls to the front desk that we finally were able to check in at 5:30 p.m. By that time, my wife was nearly dead from heat stroke, as we had decided to go to the park since we could not get into our room. I, myself, was tired because the Hard Rock has no adequate facilities for moving your luggage from the parking area to your room. Guests must either endure the conga line of traffic to the front portico or hike up a mountain of stairs from the parking area. I chose the stairs, and it was after my long march up the stairs that the doorman greeted me with, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dude, that luggage looks heavy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He was nice enough to open the door, but the thought of helping with my luggage did not enter his pierced and studded head. The room itself was nicely appointed with a good view of the garden. I was surprised by the comfortable bed, pillows, and quiet surroundings. Since most of the guests like to party, it is good to know that the Hard Rock has thick walls. After a hard and sweaty day at the park, we decided to hit the famous Hard Rock pool. It is huge and well-designed. Unfortunately, it is usually swarming with kids and sometimes there are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accidents.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As we approached the pool, we noticed there was no one swimming. The lifeguard informed us that they had to over-chlorinate the pool. When asked why, she said that a small child had emptied its bowels into the pool. YUCK!!!! Apparently, this is not uncommon at the Hard Rock pool. As we were waiting, another guest asked what was going on, and when we told her, she replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, great! No again!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It seems that the same thing happened the day before. So if you were looking to the Hard Rock as an adult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playground, think again. Dining: The Hard Rock has several semi-decent restaurants, but they are far too popular for their own good. The wait is extensive and the prices are high. We chose to return to the Portofino across the street for their excellent hand-made pizza. Checkout is early at the Hard Rock, and even though the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready for us, they still insisted on early checkout.

They have the sand beach, a great water slide that even the adults enjoyed, movies at the pool twice/week (in case of rain it's in the lobby area with lots of bean bags etc.), lots of poolside activities, vollyball, etc. We loved the music around the property and ate at the hotel almost every day or night.

You can actually sit by the pool in the sun or shade at any time during the day, watch the kids play, or take them to the child care facility for a small fee.

The weather was great, we swam all three days, played volleyball, had fun in the water slide, and watched our kids play basketball in the pool for a long time. Universal Theme Park and Islands of Adventure were great and the express pass means you never wait in line. The Bob Marley restaurant at City Walk had great spicy Jamaican food. Prices at the pool restaurant at the hotel were reasonable, and there's a market/store in the hotel where you can buy pastries, cereal, etc. You can walk by the canal to Portofino or the theme parks, or take the (free) water taxi. We were lucky to visit when the hotel and parks weren't crowded. And we had great weather. But it's a cool place. I even opened my eyes a few times on the Hulk.

I stayed at this hotel not so long ago and it was immaculate ,expensive but immaculate the rooms were not only clean and tidy they were luxury with the most comfortable bed i have ever come accross in a hotel, everything in the hotel was absolutely fantastic ,the pool was the best i have ever been in so classy and relaxing ,not deep but as i just said relaxing and classy which pretty much summed up the whole hotel, as for the staff most were spanish american , now where ever you go in america you are expected to tip , to think other wise is to say the least very nieve , and the staff in the hotel did expect a tip BUT YOU SHOW ME AN AMERICAN THAT DOSENT, now the staff were not rude they were just ... how shall i put this ..JUST AMERICANS its their culture , i mean you have to bare one thing in mind this is probably one of orlandos top hotels and if the staff were not up to scratch they would be out of a job but they are up to scratch believe me. Now the location of this hotel is brilliant its a stones throw away from city walk \" a out of this world place\" which has islands of adventure and universal studios in its grounds . When we whent to this hotel it was at the begining of september and my little boy who is eleven had just two other children round about his own age to play with while we were there ,but that was to be expected because the kids were back to school by that time , and besides he had so much fun with myself and my wife visiting all the theme parks he dident care ,but the point i am trying to make is that to suggest the hard rock hotel is over run with screaming kids is a joke , the atmosphere to this hotel is relaxed and modern .Now i will just rap up this review by simply saying this hotel is not cheap, america is not cheap , i saved up for three years to afford this holiday for my family for that one off luxury experience and it was well worth it , and if you can afford this hotel and america in genral go for it you wont regret it , but on the other hand you really are trying to do the whole thing on a budget and are reluctant to tip .

Maybe during peak season you do need your key for the lines. Someone with small kids did recommend the hotel to us. This is NOT a place for people without kids. There are kids running up and down the halls at all times of the day. We upgraded to the concierge level which was a little better but still lots of noisy kids and it cost us almost $100 a day more!

The people who worked at the concierge lounge were very young and only seemed to be interested in talking to each other about when their shift ended rather then helping any guests.

We weren't planning on getting a view of anything but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in only to see a spectacular post card shot of the pool and a wonderful view of both theme parks. If I could give any advise it would be to stay on the Club Level floor (7th). It's only accessible to those who are staying on that floor so the hallways aren't as crowded or as loud. The club lounge is great and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. It is open from 7:30 am until 11 pm every day. You have free bottled water, coffee, lemonade, iced tea, and mini cans of coke, sprite or diet coke available all day long. In addition to that, you get a free breakfast with fresh doughnuts, fruit salad, bagels, muffins, and cereal every morning. If that wasn't enough, from 5:00-7:00 each night they have free beer, wine, and hors d'oeuvres (chicken kabobs one night, pasta salad and meatballs the next, mini hot dogs another night). Then from 8-9 they serve a dessert item such as cookies, brownies, ice cream, or pudding (it changes each night). Because of these convenient perks, my family only had to buy one meal a day making our trip a lot more affordable. There is always music playing throughout the hotel and they have speakers under the water in the pool so you don't miss a song. The parks opened at 9 each morning and closed between 6 and 8 each night. We stayed just as the peak season was finishing so the fireworks weren't on and the park hours were shorter. Having the front of the line access was priceless. You can do both parks in a day or do each ride at least twice all thanks to staying on site, and your hotel is at most a 15 minute walk away or a 5 minute boat ride. Everywhere you look people are laughing or smiling and enjoying themselves. It can't be put into words the happiness and joy this hotel brings to you.

My husband was offered a sofa bed for $25/night more or an upgrade to club level for $50/night more, which is the option he took. We were quite pleased with that decision.

If you want to go to one of the parks on the day of check-in, you can check-in early in the morning (you're room will not be ready yet however), leave your bags (if you want), grab your room keys and head off to the park to take full advantage of those express lanes. Our flight got in late, so we didn't do that. However, we did go to the park the day we checked-out (check-out is 10:00 or 11 a.m.), but we got to keep our room keys and they were good for express rides until the park closed. I think the longest we waited on any ride was 10 minutes. That is an almost \"too good to be true\" perk, but it's true! I'd stay in that crappy room again if I had to just for that benefit alone. However, I felt I had to base my rating on the room, the amenities and service. As I said, I wasn't happy with our room. Another disappointment was that once we were at IOA (Islands of Adventure) we discovered that for some reason their system was not allowing room charges. Apparently their computers were having problems. So, we had to go back to our room to get more cash. Bummer. We didn't eat at any of their restaurants so I can't give an opinion of that. I would have given a much higher rating if our room was more like what you would expect out of a $230/nite hotel. However, I would give it a second chance, but this time, ask for a pool view room.", "Date": "September 3, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, WA", "Title": "\u201cHard Rock Hotel Rocks!\u201d", "Author": "rscaso", "ReviewID": "UR1268833", "Content": "You will not be disappointed in the Hard Rock Hotel! From arrival to our departure, we were treated with first class treatment (Thanks Sarah). The staff was very outgoing, friendly, and helpful. It's a great family hotel--large pool, water slide, large beach area, plenty of lounge cots and chairs at the pool. Kids activities everynight at the hotel. The music is not as loud as you may read or hear about, unless you are near the Sunset Grill Restaurant. Great access to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure--by a 5 minute walk or a 3 minute boat trip. The room key access to all the rides is AWESOME! The wait time was an average of 7 minutes. We had the budget room--non pool view side (4th floor). But that's OK, our room still had a good view and it served it's purpose. Our family decided on the last night we would stay on the \"Concierge Level\" (7th Floor). I would only recommend the 7th floor if money was not an issue. Our family did the 5 Park, 14 day flex-ticket (Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, Sea World, Wet & Wild Water Park, and Busch Gardens. A great way to see the parks and a good investment! Each park had their own highs and lows for each family member. Busch Gardens: Do the rides and see the shows, you can see wildlife animals at your local zoo and you would be supporting your local zoo. Do the rides in the mornings because if the park is not crowded in the afternoons, you may find a ride or two closed down. One Note: Don't miss the Ice Show! It is totally AWESOME! Sea World: If you're looking at seeing the shows and the marine life, this is the place to do it. But if you have children who are planning on doing rides, you will be disappointed. Wet & Wild Water Park: It's compact and it will fulfill your water needs. The park is only a few minutes away from the hotel. Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure: It's a Win-Win experience. By staying at an Universal Hotel and using your room key to by-pass the lines, you will have a great time! By going this route, you almost forget about the heat and the humidity. Alaska Airlines was our air carrier and they were great! Alamo Car Rental: Very convenient at the Orlando International Airport and good service. If you stay at the Hard Rock Hotel and you are planning on renting a vehicle, have the hotel send you driving directions to and from the airport and theme parks. Also, as you travel to the hotel from the airport, you will travel through two toll-gates. Have at least two dollars of change with you.", "Date": "August 28, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1237093", "Content": "My girlfriend and I went to the Hard Rock for 14 nights expecting a great time and were not disappointed, from the moment we arrived to the minute we left everything was fantastic. All the staff were great and very friendly, except for the pool attendant's who thought that they were better than everyone else. Using the room keys to get front of the line access is priceless, never anymore than a 15 minute wait even when some of the lines are 120 minutes long. The food in the Palm restaurant can be quite pricey but the Sunset Grill is good and the price reasonable. There is constant music, which is great and is not as loud as some people have made out, just right. All in all a great hotel and we will certainly be going back.", "Date": "August 20, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Castle, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cBest trip we ever had\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1216311", "Content": "Our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was the best we ever had.
