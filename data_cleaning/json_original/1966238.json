We chose Be PLaya because it was new and looked very modern. We were not disappointed. The room decor was very nice. And the bed was the most comfortable we had on our trip. The room had an Ipod charger (awesome) and stocked bar, even with champagne glasses. The upstairs pool area is really a gem. We really enjoyed it. I would caution to stay away from the elevator. It was acting very strangely we noticed on the first day (skipping floors, doors not opening) so from then on we took the stairs. Not too bad for a 5 story hotel. But I would not recommend this place for seniors or anybody with trouble climbing. One problem we did have with the room was that the door-less shower allowed for water to run into the sink area. This is a bad situation not only for slipping but also if you are blowdrying your hair. We used quite a bit of towels keeping the floor dry. I cannot comment on the Sushi bar since it was under remodel while we were there. We did eat breakfast one morning. It was just okay, nothing fancy. And also the breakfast staff was really inattentive. Another negative I need to mention was the beach club that the hotel recommends. The hotel gave us vouchers for drinks and chairs at a beach club called \"cannibal\"-something. Anyway, when we got there we showed the vouchers and the people said that they will give us drinks but only in the restaurant area. So we walked inside (as opposed to outside on the beach) and ordered lunch and drinks. They did honor the voucher and we had lunch which was really good. After that we went outside to the beach chairs to lounge and they said we needed to spend 350 pesos to sit there. We gave them the other voucher and said the hotel sent us and besides we already spent 500 pesos in the restuarant. The beach server suddenly got very very rude and said \"nothing in life is free, if you don't spend you have to leave\". We were going to buy beers anyway but really did she need to go there?! This kinda pissed me off and we were going to leave but after having walked 12 blocks to get to this place we decided to stay. So given that there are plenty of closer beach clubs with better service I would not bother with the vouchers or this place. OH AND I didn't even mention the worst part -the beach was not even good for swimming!! This is where all the fishing boats park! So really just skip this place. I did tell the women at BE PLAYA about the bad service at the beach club and she said she would talk to them and straighten things out. But anyway, overall as far as Be Playa hotel goes, I would recommend to friends. It was a pretty nice place!", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Rooms\u201d", "Author": "cynthia1828", "ReviewID": "UR125774622", "Content": "We were a bit leery of booking, as this property is new and few reviews are posted.

The rooftop deck and pool are equally lovely, particularly if you like solitude, as few guests seemed to use this area. What we missed (and enjoyed at La Tortuga) was a garden-type atmosphere, as Be Playa is quite modern. The free bikes were perfect for cruising around Playa.

The staff care and work on the elevator almost daily...take the stairs folks!

We have been here several times and have stayed at great boutique hotels like Deseo and Basico but thought it was time to try a hotel a bit farther up 5th. The hotel is nice looking and relatively new. That aside, I felt the staff was too casual and not very responsive. For example. my travel mate got stuck in their rusted elevator for a half hour before he was able to be freed. While the even turned out ok the staff at the hotel did not really seem to care or respond appropriately. One desk clerk laughed and simply said with a chuckle, \"That was you!\" On to the other issues and compliments. The rooms were very well maintained and clean and new which made for a wonderful stay. The air conditioning was effective and the location really perfect for great access to the beach, especially Mamitas beach club. The downsides were: - Unreliable internet connections or none at all - Staff that were mostly interested in their text messaging than helping guests - The restaurant's sushi is way too sweet and served candied ginger with rolls, weird - Not much of a concierge service and generally laid back staff (luckily I've been to PDC before) - Continental breakfast is toast and bowl of fruit which is ok but there are no options to upgrade to a bigger breakfast With a few tweaks and a better guest orientation this hotel could be a contender for a great hotel in PDC. Right now it is a good hotel with nice rooms and a relatively low guest to room ratio which is nice. Also close to everything and quiet at night which is great if you want to sleep in a city known for not sleeping.

My Husband and I stayed here recently for our honeymoon and we were beyond pleased with our stay. Modern, chic, stylish, intimate and bohemian are key words I use when describing this place. Mind you, we're not big fans of the all-inclusive gluttonous resorts, so this place was a hit for us. If you're looking for a huge crazy resort, this place isn't for you. We loved what this hotel had to offer, and it came at a reasonable price. The rooms themselves came equipped with our own personal hot tub - a true gem which we utilized everyday of our stay here. The beds were equally amazing and very comfortable. TV was good quality and had oh so many channels to choose from! Showers and other amenities also proved to be good quality. As for the staff and concierge here - they truly deserve a five star award for how helpful, accommodating, and pleasant they were to us. We got a ton of tips and great recommendations on where to go, what to see, etc. I can't say enough good things about them. They were responsive to our inquiries and always made time to chat with us and bout everything and nothing. It was hands down the best service we've gotten at a hotel in really long time. The Sushi club was delicious and reasonably priced with a great atmosphere and killer lounge music. The Pool was equally cool and very cozy. I can't really think of any setbacks to staying here other than the spotty internet. This was by no means a deal breaker for us since we were, after all, on our honeymoon. The internet was actually quite functional for emails, but if you're planning on using skype I would try the rooftop bar area - the connect there is great! Thank you BePlaya staff and management!

What to expect: Absolutely top notch decore and finishigns, beautifully appointed rooms with very spacious Jr and Master suites (did not see the Standard suite) which have in room round two-person hot-tubs and very over-sized beds and showers. Particular attention is also paid to the lighting, with many tasteful combinations of various lights throughout the rooms to set any atmosphere. The roof-top plunge pool and bar is simply gorgeous at sunset: you can eat at tables in the water (about 4 inches) or lounge in \"beech\" beds or numerous other sorts of furniture. The included breakfast is very complete and of high quality, the croissants are REAL French pastry, I was astounded! The location is very good: not too close to the \"noise\" of it all, but definitely a close walk to everything on and off 5th Ave. What you will not get: The quality of service one would expect with the profile of the property. It is actually very disappointing how the foreign staff is almost rude, and by contrast the local \"lower\" staff is helpful and ever so polite (this dialectic is not uncommon in the Cancun-Puerto Morelos-Playa del Carmen-Tulum region).

Our first part of the stay was for 2 nights at Be Playa, and we had a room with two queen beds. We prefer King, but this worked out well. The room was well appointed with a fun Jacuzzi, small sitting area, hammock on the balcony, two sinks, two person shower, and a separate toilet area. Because of the modern bowl type sinks, the counter space was a little limited, but we made due. The room included two free bottles of water (per stay apparently, not per day), and a frig with pay as you use items. Shampoo and soap was supplied, but you might want to bring your own shampoo. Always hot running water in the large showers. A/C worked great. One thing we did have to bring to the attention at check out was that our patio door did not lock and anyone from another room could have hopped over on the balcony easily and gotten in to our room. The other issue we had with this first room was that even tho it had a room safe, it wasn\u2019t bolted to anything! You could simply walk away with it. I considered it a major security issue, and the front desk seemed concerned when I told them. There was a cute rooftop pool/bar/ and lounge area with beds for sunbathing. We never saw anyone up there, and the bar was always closed. I asked at the front desk if we could get drink service up there and was told \u201cof course\u201d, but I guess you\u2019d have to go down and order it yourself, or order it before you went up. That also brings up a point that they don\u2019t have elevators. If they do, they weren\u2019t working or available yet. As part of the promotion, we left on our 3rd day to go to Be Tulum. The hotel provided the transfers and that all went smoothly. Be Tulum is a cute hotel right on the beach, with great service and a wonderful atmosphere. However, Tulum appears to be too quiet for us, so one day/night was just perfect. Upon return to Be Playa, we were then given a room with a King bed, but it was a much smaller room due to that fact. Still appointed well, but arranged differently. This time the patio door locked, and the safe was bolted inside the closet! We never did try the sushi restaurant down in the lobby. We aren\u2019t sushi fans, however it looked very nice. At night they had music playing (not too loud, didn\u2019t bother us up in the room), but there were just a handful of people at the bar.

The hotel is located just one block west of 5th Avenue (the pedestrian-only main street) in Playa del Carmen, at the northeast corner of 26th street. This is the newer, more upscale part of Playa, with a nice beach club just two blocks away. My room was a standard, which is the smallest they have. But it was huge, with two queen-size beds, plenty of room and special lighting fixtures everywhere (under the bed platform, beside each night stand, high hats over each bed, etc.). There was a large flat-screen tv suspended from the wall so you could easily adjust it to view from either bed. The bathroom had a walk-in shower with frosted glass walls on one side, two separate shower heads in the \"rain shower\" style, and tile or marble on three sides. The bathroom also had two modern above counter sinks and a toilet enclosed in a frosted glass walled separate side room. The hotel staff all were very helpful, friendly and extremely service-oriented. Even though the hotel had only been open for a week when I stayed there, the staff were all very professional and experts at their work. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Playa del Carmen. And let me just close by saying this review is coming from a traveler with very high expectations!", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Be Playa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1966238-Reviews-Be_Playa-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$99 - $224*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle 26 entre avenida 5 y avenida 10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1966238", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/47/a0/b6/the-pool.jpg"}}
