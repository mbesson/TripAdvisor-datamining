However, the heating and cooling system at the hotel is one or the other. NOT both. So, the building was still set for \"heat\" despite it being 75 degrees days and 65 nights. It was not comfortable sleeping with the room warm. I opened the window for some circulation (which then forced the curtains open...not permitting any darkness in the room) and the street was noisy. Cars, trucks, motorcycles, music from local bars, people conversing, dogs barking..you get the idea. Finally at midnight, I went to the front desk, and asked about the a/c, (told there is none) and asked if there were another room NOT facing the main street. There was not, but at midnight we changed rooms to the 5th floor, which the deskman said may be quieter. It was SLIGHTLY less noisy, but even hotter! Remember, hot air rises! Lobby is new, all marble, and very nice. Free beverages and wifi. Staff was as helpful as they could be. Hotel is modern clean. Room was average European size. Bath slightly smaller than I would have hoped but clean and new. Pillows are the cheapest uncomfortable foam pillows one can find. I suggest you contact the hotel regarding air conditioning before booking a room. Other than that issue, I was happy with this choice.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "belgium", "Title": "\u201cGood value, good location.\u201d", "Author": "guzbelgium", "ReviewID": "UR124109446", "Content": "I stayed at 1000+ hotels; This is a good hotel, I would stay here again because of location and price/value.

We picked it because it looked nice from the pictures, the reviews were good, the price was amazingly good (100 Euro/night during peak season) and the location was right. We traveled with our three children, but they stayed with my friend's family because of the difficulty in finding rooms for 5. The rooms were smallish (not all that different than a hotel in New York, Paris or London, i.e. big city - small room), but very efficient and comfortable. There really is no place to sit and relax in the room other than at the desk, but there are other places to do that in the hotel. The mini bar was free ... that is something I have NEVER seen before. Breakfast in the hotel (not free) was excellent. Everything was extraordinarily clean and well maintained, since it is essentially a new hotel. The front desk staff was very friendly and professional, and they spoke English. The bathroom was small, but had everything we needed (no bathtub). The hotel is in one of the best urban neighborhoods in Barcelona, so it is safe nighttime walking. The surrounding area has many high end European stores, so this would be a great home base for shopping, sightseeing or business. I highly recommend this hotel, even though I know that will probably create more demand and considerably higher prices. By the way, Barcelona is probably one of the most beautiful and cultured cities on earth ... make sure you really explore all of the Gaudi architectural sites -- they are amazing.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable friendly place\u201d", "Author": "PerchaNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR61404331", "Content": "Very friendly young people at reception and also making rooms and attending breakfast services, a nice quiet neighborhood with good restaurants.

I was traveling to Barcelona for the first time, before booking the hotel I had emailed them with several questions about attractions and advanced accomodation requests, they were very prompt with responses, and gave great insight and advice which was helpful since it was also my first time in Europe. Once there: Checkin went smoothly and there wasn't a wait. The location was in walking distance ( 15 or so minutes) to Las Ramblas but the area the hotel was in was very nice, had a lot of shopping, restaurants, and a pickup for the tour bus. The room was nice/clean. (not the biggest, but very modern and sleek.) Didn't have any probs with A/C. (but don't forget a plug adapter for your electronics in case they don't have any left at the front desk) On my last day prior to taking another cab to the airport, I happened to lose my wallet, the hotel staff helped me to cancel my credit cards and took my information in case they heard anything. Before I got off my flight to the US I received an email from them stating the cab driver had returned my wallet, they then shipped it to me and I received it within 2 days. This property was great before, during, and after my stay. The accomodations were very modern, sleek, and like another reviewer mentioned- they had an awesome clear sink in the bathroom. The front desk agents were kind, and helpful in terms of providing suggestions for activities and nightlife. As a past hospitality major in college, I am typically very critical about customer service, however I believe this hotel went well beyond my expectations.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, CA", "Title": "\u201cNew Year's 2006: Excellent!\u201d", "Author": "adlanda", "ReviewID": "UR8097456", "Content": "The AC Irla was clean and crazy-modern (a clear sink -- too cool!).

Such a shame, because otherwise a nice hotel. Because it was so hot/or noisy with the window open, I didn't sleep until gone 2am and so I overslept for my business meeting this morning, all a bit stressful and tiring, not ideal. However, the staff were very nice and did try to do what they could. They sympathised, gave me a big bottle of ice cold water to drink and offering to call the heating engineer,. The trouble was it was gone midnight and I wanted to sleep, not have an engineer work on the air con in my room! Other than that, really great location, fantastic for shops and in a characterful district with plenty of laid-back, stylish bars and restaurants. Very pleasant staff and nice touches in the hotel; I was told I could take anything from the minibar free (check, it might have been a special tariff and I don't want to mislead anyone!) and the coffee/bar area in the hotel foyer was free for guests - that was really good as you could make yourself a coffee anytime, so much better than having to order room service and wait. Also the breakfast was gorgeous; delicious fresh bread rolls, cheeses amazing want to eat them all again. Fresh fruit, good coffee and all that kind of thing. If I hadn't overslept, I would have taken even longer over breakfast. Not the biggest rooms in the world, but nicely laid out with super- clean bathrooms and, oh yes, a fantastic range of stuff in the bathroom including comb, toothbrush and toothpaste, razor, tissues, shoe shine, showercap etc. and, joy, a proper professional hairdryer with blow-dry nozzle (fab news for my fellow frizzy-haired friends out there!) All in all, a very nice hotel, just turn the temperature down and it will be even better.", "Date": "April 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cLoved the room and area\u201d", "Author": "caliCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR5354327", "Content": "I went to Barcelona for business recently and had the pleasure of staying at AC Irla.
