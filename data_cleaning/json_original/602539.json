{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A good hotel for non-chinese speakers My wife and I stayed in the hotel for six day during a conference and had no problems.Clean room, cable internet, CNN and HBO made our life easy. The staff has asked as if everything was OK, once we moved in and then they asked again when we were checking out. Hotel has cards with address and small map to show to cab drivers. The complimentary map of Beijing was very helpful. Very helpful English speaking staff is a very big advantage.Taxi is available right in front of the hotel. We had a late night flight back and left our luggage all day long in the hotel once we checked out, at no cost.There are two supermarkets in walking distance. Safe environment to take a walk, I think this is true for most of Beijing anyway.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR878013698", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SelimSanin"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d602539-r5814931-Kaikang_International_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "602539", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
