The lobby and restaurants are beautiful, the gym is excellent and the room was well appointed. But HELLO! IS ANYBODY AT MARIOTT HEADQUARTERS LISTENING? I am not the first person to complain about the following issues. (Scroll down) They apparently don't care. There is no Wifi in the room. There is a Eathernet Cable. But Internet is 250 pesos per day. That's about $21.00! Outrageous! I called Customer Service to complain about the price. They said someone would call me back. I never received a call. There were no wine glasses in our room the second day. I again called Customer Service. After 45 minutes I headed down to the Front Desk to talk to the Manager on Duty. The young lady at the front desk told me that the Manager on Duty was \"In his room\". She said he would be down in 5 minutes. The Manager on duty (Jaime Gonzalez) finally showed up after about 15 minutes. He said he would send wine glasses to my room, but that he would have to check with another Manager (Daniel Sanchez) to see if there was anything they could do about the price of the Internet. He said that i should return to my room and he would call me in 5 minutes. He called 10 minutes later and said that they could offer me 6 hours of Internet at 1/2 price. I explained that I needed 24-hour service and he finally agreed to 24 hours at 1/2 Wow. . .how rigid? HELLO MARIOTT. . .this Hotel needs to do something different with the Internet. Just one more comment. Yes, the Hot Tub is luke warm and its outside. I'm not the first one to say this. IS ANYONE LISTENING? They must just not care. And one recommendation: Ask for a room that is not on the East side of the building if you are staying on a Friday or Saturday night.

My colleagues and I encountered several problems trying to secure a government rate. I spent the better part of a day presenting ID's, explaining my situation, and requesting corroborating emails to obtain special rates. The kicker is that my colleague booked online and was able to get the special rate without presenting any ID or any corroborating documents. Also, I was told that internet access was included in my special rate, which it wasn't. Other issues- the elevators are key activated, so you can only get off on your floor, the lobby, or the exectuvie lounge. Thre major problem was that the key reader didn't work, so I'd spend several cycles going up and down on the elevator trying to get it to read my key so I could get back to my room! I saw several other guests having the same problem. In the bar, we were having a casual meet and greet with local colleagues, but the live music was extremely loud (even though it was a jazz duo). We asked if they could turn the music down, which they did, but when the duo came back from their break, they turned the music back up! When we asked again, the waitress told us we could go to the other side of the lobby away from the music. So we left the bar, and we saw most of the bar patrons follow suit. Seems to me that if several bar patrons are requesting softer music, you would turn the music down, no? They were extremely rigid at the executive lounge- you couldn't take any food or drink back to your room, and they asked repeatedly for our room numbers. You have to pay for internet access, and it is limited to one device per room. Not one device at a time, but one device period. That means you would need to pay for two codes if you wanted to use an iphone/bb and computer, even if not at the same time. Talk about nickle and diming... And finally, the sister of a colleague called repeatedly and was told that my colleague had not yet checked in, even though she had arrived and was the one that had made the reservations for our whole group.

We had a terrible time negotiating with the hotel management after we experienced some troubles with our room. On the first night, we discovered that the bathtub wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drain and although this was inconvenient, we could and did live with it. However, we did immediately notify the management so that they could have someone look into fixing the problem. On the next day, we discovered that the hotel door didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lock properly! Considering that we were both unfamiliar with Mexico City, we were extremely concerned about the security issues of sleeping without a proper lock and the fact that we had been leaving all of our possessions (including passports) in the room. It took upwards of an hour to get the hotel manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention, and finally, my boyfriend had to run down to reception to find him in person. The manager, Benjamin, came up to demonstrate that the door had to be shut forcefully a certain way in order for the lock to automate. This meant that the door, while it looked closed, had actually been unlocked the entire time. At this point, my boyfriend felt disgruntled enough to want to check out of the Marriott and into the Sheraton across the street. However, I was a Marriott loyalist, and convinced him that we should just switch rooms instead. It took two calls and an hour wait to get a new room. As an aside, the hotel staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s English is very poor, and this led to various misunderstandings about wanting to switch rooms. The new room had a perfectly functioning door that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require extra force / finagling. Upon checkout, we politely asked for additional bonus points to compensate for the inconvenience of having had to deal first with this many problems with a room, the insensitively long wait times, and then the actual room switch. This is a reasonable request by two Platinum members, but we were told that the arrival gift was sufficient and that we already had gotten a new room. By all accounts, a new room is the least that a hotel should offer to hotel guests of any level when there is a potential security issue. We found the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response times to our various problems for the duration of our stay to be unacceptable, and the hotel manager, Benjamin, was completely unresponsive to our last request of compensation in the form of points. The rest of the stay was fine, but the beginning frustration and shock of the malfunctioning lock and the ensuing stonewalling from hotel management is not worth anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time.

This means that if you want to connect your iphone and your laptop to the wifi signal you have to pay two separate fees. I thought this was rather greedy.

This is definitely one of those trying to be an upscale hotel, but failing miserably. There are a few people here that are interested in customer service, but the majority are not. Even if you ignored the attitudes of some and focused on the hotel itself there a problems and no one wants to address them. The first problem I had was my door didn't lock when the door was closed the majority of the time.....I would come back to the room, check the door and it was unlocked, especially after housekeeping service.. I called about it...they sent a guy up...who stuck a key card in the door and declared it fixed. Not so much!! In summary, after several calls and being told: to stick the card in the door several times until I hear it click....pull the door closed and place my card in the door several times until I hear a click, .and it's \"normal\" for the doors not to lock and they have the problem \"all the time\" I was finally moved to a room where the door actually locks. I had five people at my door before it was determined that the door was actually not working and they would need to move me because the guy sticking a screwdriver in the doorway wasn't really accomplishing anything. The voice mail service in this room is broken, and instead of fixing it, they turn the \"message waiting\" light on in my room when they have a message or want me to make a weekly payment. The last time, they wouldn't/couldn't turn the red flashing light off. They told me to call a number which I did and it still wouldn't turn off. I finally unplugged the phone and the next day they had to send someone up to turn the light off...not to fix the voice mail. Ridiculous! A few days ago the showers had no water when I called after a few hours to ask if they knew when there would be water again. I was told they would call when the water was available. They never called. Fortunately the water did become available hours later, and I knew to check it, not to rely on anyone here. Today I had 3 men come to my door and tell me they needed to check the electricity in the room and it would take one minute. They came in, turned off the t.v.turned off the internet access to my computer which I was using, moved all of the furniture around, took panels off the wall and began talking on their walkie talkies after a few minutes I asked how much longer they would be and they told me a few more minutes....NOT the one minute they had originally said at the door. I told them they had said one minute, it had been several, and I had things to do and they didn't really seem concerned. When I called to the front desk to speak to a manager I was told I didn't need to speak to a manager that maintenance was allowed in my room anytime. After further conversation and being placed on hold I was told the manager was in a \"very important business meeting\" and would call me in 30 minutes.....hours later guess who I never heard from!!!!! The fitness center is very nice, and they always have fresh towels on the equipment, but they don't clean the equipment, if someone leaves garbage in the cup holders, it's going to be there the next day and a few days later. The saunas and steam room have been unavailable for awhile, but that's due to a fire that was reportedly caused by a male guest that left the sauna on, so that is our of their control.

The hotel was opened 4 months prior, in December or November of 2008. It is brand new. All staff jumped at every request, from arrival to departure. A walk across the lobby earns quite a few \"buenos dias\", truely making me feel like a valued guest. I had a AAA rate and they are the only place that has ever asked me to present my id card upon checkin. I had a weekend rate that I thought was very reasonable, especially for a Marriott, and for the location. It is across the street from the US Embassy and borders the Zona Rosa. The subway is approximately 4 block walk away, something I felt was close. The hotel gym is very nicely equipped with 5 or 6 treadmills and a few other cardio pieces, free weights, machine weights, and quite a few other goodies. Individual tv's on most cardio machines. There is an outdoor pool. I did not use the business center. I ordered room service twice. Both times it was brought promptly by a friendly staff member. I thought the pricing was reasonable, if I remember correctly, it was $13 for a club sandwich and beer, including tax and tip. The room is nicely apportioned, exactly what you would expect from a Marriott. Perhaps the room is a bit small, but that is fine with me. If I had to complain, it would be the internet charge in the room is expensive at $18/day. I ended up going around the corner with my laptop to a starbucks where it is free. Also the hotel has a nice car service to take you where you need to go that is comfortable and well done. However, it is roughly twice that of other car services that you can call. Those would be my two cost issues I would mention. Overall this is a great property for a business visit. The staff could not have been more willing to please.

Both hotels were great! The Marriott Reforma is in the Zona Rosa area. It was recently remodelled and has been open one month so everything is nice and new. I did not have a room with a great view; there's construction going on, however, this was never ever an issue as the work didn't begin until maybe 9am and actually was not loud. I want to stress that I didn't find this an issue like in some places I've stayed in where construction is taking place. I stayed here during Christmas time and the hotel was very empty, but I would not hesitate to recommend staying here.

Everything is brand new very high tech as the previous poster indicated. The gym is fabulous, everything was brand new in the exercise room and they have a whole spa. The gym occupies almost a whole floor and I only used the machines but they had a small pool (outside and not heated) and a Jacuzzi. The hotel has only opened a few weeks ago (my guess is early December 2008). However some of the staff indicated it had not been inaugurated officially so it was some sort of soft opening. The staff is very helpful although they are still not completely up to speed and some things take a little while. For example I charged my taxi to the airport to the room and it took them almost 20 minutes to do my checkout. However staff is very helpful. They have their own La Mansion restaurant on premises with a great view of Reforma avenue. The building is only 12-15 stories high as it was an old hotel that was converted (Aristos). However I believe they gutted everything as it appeared brand new all around. Actually I suspect I may have been the first guest to occupy the room I as in 1209 as the TV wasn't wired properly. It would turn on but not change channels. I am technically inclined and checked the wiring and found out the hotel control box was connected to the AUX port instead of TV port and fixed this. This indicated to me that either I was the first guest in the room or they previous guests had not used the TV which is probably unlikely. Did room service a couple times and they were quite helpful. My MR points haven't posted in over a week so I suspect they may have issues with their systems due to being so new.

I ended up here because I tried to book into the W in Mexico City and their booking service was so terrible I gave up! The new Marriott (open less than a week when I was there) has a stunning lobby, very enthusiastic staff and fairly small rooms. But don't be put off by the small rooms, they make incredible use of the available space and are probably the most technologically advanced of any hotel I've stayed in (i.e. put your ipod in the alarm clock docking port and it will wake you with your favourite tunes!). As such, you need to let the bellboy explain what everything does in the room, because you'll be amazed. This hotel is right by the Zona Rosa, so good for restaurants, bars etc, as well as being central (if such a thing exists in DF) for business.
