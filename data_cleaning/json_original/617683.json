The room was clean, but pretty small, also (as another user mentioned) TV only had Italian programs; but on the other hand you don't go to Rome to spend all your time in the hotel room. Breakfast was good, actually better than expected. One downside would be that it was pretty noisy, but this could have been due mostly to the fact that our room was close to the stairway, and you could easily hear people when they were going up and down the stairs (this is not a good thing, especially if you have trouble sleeping). The staff was ok. Transportation to city center was also very good. Close to the hotel you can find a bus station, from which you can take bus 542 to Bologna metro station (and from there 3 stations to Termini or 5 stations to Colosseum) or bus 61 also to Bologna metro station or to Barberini metro station. Taking a 3 day pass that costs 11 euros (one trip costs 1 euro), for both metro and bus, is a really good deal. All in all, this is a good hotel, considering the good price, and if you don't like busy areas like Termini.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ctoo noisy\u201d", "Author": "Tracy B", "ReviewID": "UR127029512", "Content": "this was supposed to be a romantic break as it was our honeymoon, but we didnt get that.

The one that stops at EVERY single station along the way. Our thinking was that we would catch some sleep on the overnight train and then drop our bags at the hotel and finish our last day in Italy sightseeing and shopping. Boy was that a bad idea. We googled the walking directions from Tiburtina station and they seemed a bit convoluted, so we emailed the hotel for more specific directions and were told to take bus 309 to the end of the line (XXI Aprile) and then walk 5 minutes. At eight in the morning after you've been up all night those might not be specific enough instructions. We spent a while asking for directions, looking at the google map on the phone, etc. We finally arrived at the hotel and the manager greeted us by name when we walked in. He let us know that he would be happy to store our bags, but that if we wanted to step into the breakfast area and eat he would have our (quad) room ready within the hour. He let us know a few minutes later that they weren't able to have the quad room ready that early, but he had two double rooms that were waiting for us for no additional charge if we wanted to get showered and get some rest we could go right up. We didn't even let him get the offer out of his mouth all the way before we were climbing the stairs to the rooms. We all showered and slept the better part of the day. I'm not sure we would have made it otherwise. We didn't wander out for food until about 5pm or so. The rooms themselves were VERY quiet. VERY clean. They had everything we needed, including shampoo, conditioner, in-room safe and mini-fridge. We couldn't have been happier with the accommodations. The manager suggested that we might consider an airport shuttle instead of lugging our baggage back across the city to Termini and catching the Leonardo Express. We actually ended up paying around the same amount but with much less wear and tear on our bodies / nerves. I appreciated his suggestion. I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat. The staff was so accommodating, and they could see immediately how very weary and exhausted we were the minute we hit the door. The manager's kindness almost brought me to tears that morning.

We check at the Radisson and they didn't have our reservations, but were kind enough to call the Osimar and get information on the hotel where we eventually stayed, it was two blocks away from the Radisson. The Hotel Mamiani is where we ended up which was a small, quiet, clean hotel where you can't drink the water out of the sink (they have signs posted). The Hotel Mamiani wasn't bad in general, but not what we had booked, nor what we paid for, the rate didn't change just because the hotel did. I recommend highly against the Hotel Osimar because of thier \"dumping\" policy. p.s. - A Big \"Grazie!\" to the desk clerks at the Radisson for sorting this mess out for us.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCareful with thin walls!\u201d", "Author": "LondonDodo3", "ReviewID": "UR8664761", "Content": "The room was overall decent and modern. Breakfast not great but ok. The major downside was that the hotel was quite far from the center. Although it says that it's just one station away from the Termini; you still need to walk to the tube station for about 15 minutes, and take the metro for about 5 stops to actually get to touristic attractions. The other problem was that walls were very thin. I could hear the guy in the other room snoring at night. It felt we were all sleeping in the same room, which was very inconvenient.", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "sly_racoon", "ReviewID": "UR6843720", "Content": "A nice clean hotel.
