It's at the top of the building and, although big in size, it lacks windows. It only has two small skylights, one in the bedroom and the other one in the seating area, making it too dark.

The hotel is situated on a busy square in the day time, regular local buses conveniently just across the street that run from early morning to late night so no problem getting into and from the centre of Florence. There are numerous cafe's and a fantastic Ice cream shop within 2 mins walk. The area is quite in the evenings though with the cafe's, bar,s and shops closing quite early. Monica, the owner and her family and staff could not have done enough for us. Booking local places to eat, giving good tourist info, train times/local bus info so we could explore the wider regions of Florence and Tuscany on our own without a set tour(don,t miss Lucca and Fiesole), and will book you museum tickets to avoid the queue,s . Although we would definately recommend the Chianti/Sienna tour. Really good value, visiting a beautiful vineyard in the heart of the Tuscan hills, with lunch, wine tasting and a whole lot more. The trip starting at 9.30 a,m and not returning to Florence until 8p.m. Fantastic day.  Our room was lovely and spacious with french doors that opened up onto the square. The bathroom although not big was nicely laid out and just like the rest of the hotel was very clean and beautifully decorated. Breakfast.s were delicious. Cold buffet type, but everything you could think of was there.It was a special trip for us and the thought and care that Monica and her staff had gone to the trouble of to make our stay so lovely was fantastic.

My husband and I stayed here for 4 days in mid-September for our honeymoon/anniversary. As attorneys living in NYC, we've had to stay at many hotels which mostly have been wonderful, but we CANNOT say enough about Rosary Garden! It was hands down the best hotel experience that either of us have ever had. There's a reason this hotel jumped roughly 500 spots to the #4 hotel in Florence since new management took over.From the moment we pulled up, the staff made us feel as welcome as our own families do. Our hotel room was incredibly big by European standards, and also was beautifully decorated and very clean. The rest of the hotel is equally beautiful with a comfy apperitivi room and lobby. We just can't believe the rates are as reasonable as they are!But the best aspect of the experience was the staff. Alessandro, Monica, and Monica's son Andrea were simply the best. They had put the most delicious champagne in our room because we told them it was our anniversary. Every time we had a question, needed a bus ticket, or wanted a restaurant recommendation, they were there with the most helpful advice. I also lost my purse (which contained my wallet, passports, camera, iPod, etc.) in a cab and Alessandro made phone calls to the cab companies, the police, the US consulate, etc. He was so genuinely concerned about me getting my belongings back and eventually the hotel did get them back for me! (Would never happen in NYC!).Monica sat with us one night during apperitivis, and she is just too sweet for words. We couldn't believe that she was taking time out to speak with us when she had this busy hotel to run!Admittedly, we were slightly reluctant to stay here because the hotel is on the other side of the Arno River, not in Florence's city center. But this turned out to be just another asset of the hotel! We walked back to the hotel from the city a couple of times during our stay and it allowed us to see another part of Florence, one that most tourists would never see otherwise! So please do not let its location keep you from staying. Additionally, right downstairs from the hotel is a restaurant where we had one of our best meals in all of Italy, and a gelato place with the most delicious (and cheapest) gelato we found in Italy.

My wife and I spent three wonderful nights there in the Spring (2008), and it was absolutely perfect. Located outside the noise and crowds of downtown Florence, the Hotel Rosary Garden (HSG) is well-situated in a quiet little neighborhood a little beyond the Bardini Gardens. One of the best gelato shops in all of Italy is right next door (and we tried many, many others). Nearby, within short five-minute walking distance, are several excellent restaurants. The hotel itself is everything you could ask for and more. Our room, a superior double, had HUGE vaulted ceilings with exposed wood beams, a comfy sofa, a sizeable bathroom (for Italy), and many other niceties. The breakfasts, included in the price of the room, are served in a cozy little room and are quite tasty. There were also several rooms in the HSG set aside simply for relaxing, with free danish cookies, tea, and digestivos (liqueurs). In a word, wonderful.But the very best part of HSG is the owner, Monica. Although the staff is excellent, Monica is unparalleled as a host, concierge, and friend to her guests. She is what an Italian host (or any host) should be. I could honestly go on for paragraphs about the HSG. Given the terrific value that it offers, I would rank this hotel among the best in Italy; It offers the ease, comfort, and beauty of a five-star hotel without the snootiness and the attitude. If you are in Florence and they have room, stay at the Hotel Rosary Garden. You will be very, very glad that you did. Note: If you are wondering how to get there from the train station (as we were), please email the hotel staff first as a bus goes directly from the station to the square where the HSG resides.

I started to cancel when I saw the location, but the reviews were so good we decided to stay. I'm glad we did. It was the nicest hotel room we had on our entire trip, including one of the Hiltons in Paris.I'm very glad for the people who had no trouble taking a bus to the hotel. We took a cab, and I think the cost with luggage was 15 Euros. It was very, very quick and easy to take a bus into town each day and the kind and gracious hotel staff told us exactly which buses would take us where. We had our choice of several buses which ran frequently and could buy a discount pass at the newspaper stand in front of the hotel. There was one stop right in front of the hotel, and another behind the Coop groc;ery store. Getting a bus back was not so easy as there was absolutely no way we could figure out which direction the buses were going, so we took cabs back to the hotel at a cost of about 10 Euros.There was a restaurant underneath the hotel, La Pizzatta that was quite good. We went in at about 8:30 and were asked if we had a reservation and I rolled my eyes because the place was empty. By the time we finished it was packed. Prices were very reasonable except for the steaks, which come from some type of special cows and cost 60 euros. At those prices I hope they can sing and dance!About a quarter-mile down the main street towards Florence was a cheap sit-down pizza place and a good gelato parlor (the pizza place is across the street from the gelato parlor, not the first place you come to). We enjoyed both.It was also nice to have the Coop grocery across the street. This is a giant store -- they even have an electronics department. I was able to buy bread, meat, cheese, fruit, soft drinks and a tube of mayonaise to make a meal on the train to Rome and another after we got there. It was a real and much needed cost savings.Check-in for this hotel is on the second floor, so if you have mobility problems it won't do. For anyone else, the quality of the hotel should more than make up for the location, but of course that is a decision each person will have to make for themselves.

It was far and away the most welcoming of all the places we stayed (Ireland, London, Paris, Italy) in the entire time we were away. Monica, the owner , was gracious and charming and nothing was a bother. I watched her spend at least 10 minutes with a guest in order to ensure that he knew exactly where he was travelling to whilst at the same time she ensured that another staff member attended to my needs. The little extra touches (bowls of sweets, apperitifs in the charming little sitting room, dainty biscuits available with coffee/tea -also in the little sitting room) were superb. It was such a comfortable hotel - the breakfast was delightful and we found that the short bus ride into the city centre was another way of meeting the locals. (The same gentleman helped me validate my bus ticket two days in a row much to the delight of the fellow passengers!). If we were coming back to Florence my only object would be to ensure that Monica was still in charge - I have no doubt that it is her finger on the pulse that ensured our stay was so pleasant.", "Date": "Aug 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR396299634", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "zorroSydney"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel, unusual location We stayed at the Rosary Garden over Easter and really liked this small, comfortable, quiet hotel.

It is quaint and cozy, our room was big and decorated beautifully and had two showers. The owner was very nice and made sure we were happy with our room, which we were very happy with it.
