Yes, the shower stalls are tiny, but the towels are super nice and big which you learn to appreciate when you travel a lot in italy. Most of our clients love the location right next to the catacombs and nearby to some really good restaurants. There is bus from Termini and a cab ride to most places of interest is less than 15 Euros during the day. I look forward to staying there again for our Incantato tour groups and myself.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cNice reliable hotel\u201d", "Author": "michiganmmt", "ReviewID": "UR28869021", "Content": "Great clean hotel run by nuns.

It's clean, comfortable, very quiet. Every so often you would see a nun disappearing round the corner. It's actually owned by a religious order who run the hotel as a way to make money for their charity. There's an interesting modern chapel on the top floor. Starngely soulless place, and not somewhere you'd want to spend a great deal if time in. Rooms were fine, well equipped and comfortable. The buffet breakfasts were very good, but we decided not to eat dinner there as we got the feeling we would have had the place to ourselves. Very intereting catacombs literally next door, and about a half mile walk away is a very interesting mausoleum \"Fosse Ardettiene\" a wonderful piece of 1950's modernist architecture.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Kolping Hotel Casa Domitilla", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d280224-Reviews-Kolping_Hotel_Casa_Domitilla-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$96 - $137*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via delle sette Chiese, 280</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">147</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "280224", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/45/a3/4b/outside.jpg"}}
