This hotel is very convenient and clean. My only issue- Upon checking out I started to walk to the desk (from the nearby breakfast area) and the man at the desk looked at me and went into the back room. I then had to wait at least 5 minutes and finally as my husband asked why I was still waiting he came back out to help me. It was odd and added to that there is no bell at the desk. So my only options to get help are to stand there and wait or yell. Location is great. It's not far off the highway and it is right by Walmart and several places to eat. Perfect stop and sleep location.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cQuality stay for cheap\u201d", "Author": "grunter4", "ReviewID": "UR116253826", "Content": "We only stayed one night.

We called ahead to this motel and explained the special accomodations required to care for him, and we were told they could meet the requirements. We arrived late at night, and before they would even show me the room, I was required to sign the credit card slip, so they could \"close out their books\" for the night. When I got to the room it was not at all as described, and there was no way to take care of my husband there, as I could not even get him into their bed. When I went back to the desk they refused to give me a refund, and even charged me for my two lap dogs, which were never out of our car. The credit card company said there is nothing they can do, and the motel staff lied and said we were there and used the room for six hours! We were not! Instead we went directly across the street to the Red Roof Inn, where they not only had the correct accomodations, but were extremely concerned and helpful. DO NOT STAY at this Super 8.

You can get downtown in 10-15 minutes max. It sits right in front of a Super Wal-Mart (so you can get anything you might need) and has about a dozen eateries nearby. No, it isn't the Crowne Plaza, so you do have to park your own car and carry your own bags. But the staff could not have been nicer. The room was sparkling clean, had a zillion cable channels to watch, and free internet...and every morning a free breakfast.
