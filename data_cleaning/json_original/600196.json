When we arrived at the motel and entered our room, we were in SHOCK!! The room was absolutely filthy and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. There was sand everywhere in the bathroom, towels were damp and moldy smelling, hair was everywhere.. After all of this i flipped back the bed only to find stained sheets and HOLES that had been CHEWED in the bed from bugs. I was absolutely disgusted and couldn't bare the thought of even standing in that room, let alone sleeping in it. When we let the front desk know what was wrong, they were less than accomodating and refused to return our money. We were furious and we walked down Baltimore Avenue looking for different rooms until we were able to find a beautiful one at the Spinnaker Motel where we stayed for our trip.

For the low price we were expecting a run down place,but since we only need a place to sleep and shower we took a chance. I am glad we did!!! The hotel is sweet. A cute place. Yes the rooms are small,but like I said you really only need a room for showering and sleeping. The rooms were clean, the staff was very nice and helpful. The front porch is great for sitting and people watching. WIFI in the rooms is a plus. I also found that they have apartments and efficiency apartments at a great daily price. The only down side is there is no phone in the room at all.

Yay. Until arrival. DO NOT go by the pictures on the internet. Very misleading. We pulled into the parking area ( we had two vehicles because there were six in our party) that was very small and cramped but hey, we'll make due. We went inside the office around 2pm to check in. They said the room wasnt ready yet and that check in wasnt until 4pm anyway but they would give us a parking permit so we could leave our car there until our room was ready. They would only give us a permit for one vehicle and said that we would have to find street parking somewhere else for the second vehicle. We decided that since we were only a block from the boardwalk that we would go grab an early dinner before we checked in to get that out of the way. At dinner we decided that by the looks of the outside of the hotel that it would be best if we looked at the 2 bedroom apartment before we checked in to see what it actually looked like. This is where the real disappointment begins. Upon entering the apartment it looked as if it were some sort of a frat house with stains on the floors and walls, a kitchen table that looked like it belonged along side the street with a \"free\" sign on it, the place smelled bad, and the bathroom tile looked as if someone tried to paint the grout black because it was stained that bad with missing tile. We decided to go back to the front desk and ask for a refund and take our chances trying to find somewhere else to stay due to the overall condition of the apartment. We were told that it is not in their policy to refund the deposit regardless of what we thought of the place. (In dispute with my credit card company right now). This is a huge vacation area and we came to the decision that if we couldnt find another place to stay that we would hop back in the vehicles and make the four and a half hour return trip home. IT REALLY IS THAT BAD. After walking up and down the area for a couple hours and a dozen or so inquiries to other hotels/motels that could possibly accomodate our 6 person party we finally found another 2 bedroom apartment at The Commander Hote. 100% upgrade. The price was about $200 more for the five night stay but it was well worth it. Very clean, Very well maintained and a very understanding and professional staff. I do highly recommend The Commander Hotel. Now, if I was an 18 year old recently graduated from high school at the beach for senior week with intentions of drinking my way in to oblivion while at the beach the Buckingham would be fine as I wouldnt have to worry about breaking or ruining anything in my drunken stupor.

My only salvation came from the couple recent reviews that appear to have been published post-renovation. All in all, my experience wasn't terrible. This isn't exactly the hotel you recommend to others or want to spend more than 2 days in, though. Rolling up to this place, I was convinced a young Anthony Perkins (or worse, a young Vince Vaughn) would come traipsing out of the door to help me with my bags. The fact that our bathroom had a small door with a missing knob on it that connected to the adjacent motel room didn't help ease my fears that I'd be hearing stuccato violins during my last seconds on this earth. Thankfully, that's about all that's off-putting about this place. Apparently the renovations they did recently were sufficient because during a 2 night, 3 day stay I didn't see one insect or discarded condom (inside...the parking lot had a stray Lifestyles wrapper blowing about in the wind. Though better safe than sorry) that other, pre-renovation reviews mentioned. Linens were clean and the bathroom was spotless, if only a bit old. The whole place needed new wallpaper altogether. And I couldn't imagine staying in that small of a room for more than 2 nights without killing whoever I was with. The two staff I encountered weren't terrible or rude. Just strange. The cleaning lady was spunky and sassy but never delivered on the clean linens she promised us. I had to bring our wet towels to the girl at the front desk who appeared younger than I am (23), who told me I \"cccoooooould have new towels, but they're all in the dryer\". Thankfully, after returning from dinner later that night, a pile of fresh towels were waiting for us when we opened our door. The parking lot was cramped, and the other guests there seemed to be young kids who were about 2 months too late celebrating Senior Week, or people who just didn't know any better/had no other choice...95% of the hotels this past weekend were rocking the NO VACANCY sign, including Buckingham. Basically, this is a place to rest your (hopefully drunken) head for a night or two when you have no other choice (or money). Don't even dare book a room for a week and bring the kids for a nice family get-away. It's steps from the boardwalk, and it's cheap, but you get what you pay for.
