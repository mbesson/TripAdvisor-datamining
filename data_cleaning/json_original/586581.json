And if I am lucky enough to travel again to Italy I shall definitely return there for the Venice portion of the trip. Because it has all the important things conducive to a good vacation stay, and at reasonable rates. First, location. Quite perfect: steps from the Rialto Bridge with its shops and several Grand Canal vaporetto stops (including one making getting to or from the train station a breeze), easy walking distance to San Marco - or, heading off in virtually any other direction from the Guerrato - to many other sights, close to both the delightful vegetable/fruit market and, a couple of blocks farther away,Venice's marvelous huge fish market (though I wasn't prepared to cook and therefore wasn't intending to purchase any of the market's wares, the market both was exciting in itself and made it clear that I was likely to be eating very fresh fish at whatever nearby restaurants chose for suppers), and a ten-minute stroll to a spot on the lagoon shore where the various boats heading out to the islands stop frequently. In spite of its central location near the hustle and bustle of various tourist attractions, the hotel is delightfully quiet due to its being set part way down a narrow alley devoid of shops or restaurants. Nights were therefore peacefully silent - even though, in my case, I usually slept (it was a warm March!) with windows flung open. Second, rooms and rest of the interior. From the burnished wood of the entrance stairs through the roomy and distinctively-decorated public area and the large bright breakfast room there is a welcoming warmth and other evidence of the hosts having taken the time to make visitors feel comfortable and, at the end of the day, likely to be glad to get back to their Venetian \"home\". The two rooms in which I stayed - and the couple of others that I happened to catch glimpses of through open doors - were large and lovely, each one decorated with care and with objects of quality. And clean and comfortable, absolutely. Third (though perhaps not in importance), the hosts. They are always pleasant, though never instrusive. And they are happy to aid a visitor with almost anything - planning a day's outing, catching a train or boat, finding just the sort of restaurant for which one is yearning, or simply efficiently negotiating one's way through Venice's maze of streets and alleys which, however delightful,aren't always easy to efficiently negotiate one's way through (even for one with excellent map-using skills!). The sensitivity to, i.e., the ability to understand, a visitor's individual preferences or whims was particularly notable. On several occasions Roberto quickly grasped what sort of experience I felt like. For example one day I felt like escaping to quiet \"ordinary\" residential streets near public gardens (and Arsenale's lions, which I'd promised my little grandkids I'd photograph for them) for half the day, while visiting San Marco and the museums bordering its piazza for the other half. And wanting to find myself outside when the light would be loveliest, I wondered how I should order these activities. He worked out a plan involving some streets - and an unpretentious little island - I'd never otherwise have visited, and certainly got the order exactly right: the day, including the the directions in which the sun shone, was one of my best in Venice. He also helped me get my islands day - Murano (the grandkids again, as I'd promised them I'd see the glass blowers and bring them some little glass objects) and Torcello (perhaps my favorite spot in Venice) - off to a wonderful start by working out, after I mentioned how lost I usually got trying to get to the aforementioned place where visitors catch the boats heading for the islands, a simple (yes, in Venice!) \"back\" way which combined a 50-cent across-the-Canal gondola ride (fun and cheap!) and a pleasant stroll between Canal and lagoon along a relatively straightforward and tourist-free route. And I'm convinced that in either of these cases had I (or other of his visitors) wanted a different sort of experience, the suggestions would have fit my (or their) desires rather than merely reflect his own ideas of what a good day in Venice might be. All in all, lodgings I loved - and to which, as I said above, I'll definitely return should I get to Italy again. P.S.

It really feels like you are in a venetian home and the green walled breakfast room with huge mirrors is a real gem! The location is great! I love the great restaurants and small eateries around the hotel which are walking distance - if you need any recommendations, just ask the staffs. They really knows everything if not everyone in that neghbourhood. The location is always buzz with actions & activities, morning will be the fresh markets, and evening will be the night markets that are filled with well priced souveniers, snacks & goodies to bring back home. food selections are in full abundance.

The water pressure in the shower was terrible and it was very frustrating to rinse out shampoo! The a/c worked well and was quiet. My husband developed tonsilitis in Venice, and we had to travel to our next destination a day early in order to be with family, because he was not comfortable in the hotel.

We had 2 twin beds pushed together, and they were a little firm but fairly comfortable. The odd thing about our room (and we didn't see other rooms) was that there appeared to be no effort to make it inviting or warm. There wasn't a picture on the walls, or a rug covering the cold marble floor. The lights in both the bedroom and bathroom were bare bulbs that shined way too brightly. We happened to hit cool, rainy days, and maybe that contributed to the feeling of coldness, but we kept wondering, why not spend the minor dollars it would take to make the place inviting? What would the cost be for a couple of area rugs, or a couple of pictures of the canals on the walls, or some shades for the bulbs? We tend to be happy travelers and we had a great time, the people at the desk were nice and helpful, the breakfast was great. It's a fine pick especially in warm weather when you'll be spending less time in the room.

The included breakfast is served in a nice little dining room with Italian opera playing in the background. The buffet offerings of croissants, cereals, yogurts, etc. were uninspired but the ambiance helped. Tip - Beware Of Local Custom - when you tour the fruit market, don't touch the fruit. My wife did.

Our Venice trip didn't start well, but the room made it worse. We arrived in Venice on a train 1 hour delayed due to a general strike in Italy, only to be run around another hour and a half by the vaperetto pass staff (Really.. 5 different kiosks to get my //venice.connected 48 hour passes... Really!), haul our luggage on the vaperetto, get immediately checked by the police, and then finally haul our luggage up the stairs to the Pensionne... Only to be given a room right off the lobby/dining room that smelled musty and had dead bug stains (mosquitos?) smeared down the walls. The hotel is nicely located - great to be by the Rialto area - but really, no excuse for the condition of the room. We were there for only two nights. The next morning, we woke to the sound of the dining room dishes clattering. We found the bathroom was moldy. We ate in the dining room, and it was REALLY crowded. Too crowded. Couldn't even sit tucked in our chair without bumping into the people behind us, and we are not large people. We came back to our room the next night to a huge group of people right outside our room. I guess the only place the internet worked was right outside our room in the lobby, and there were at least 15 people, some leaning against our bedroom door sitting on the floor. It was awkward to get them to move just so we could get into our own room... Anyway, the next morning we were awakened REALLY early by the REALLY LOUD voice of the guy behind the desk. As we checked out, I mentioned my disappointement that I had booked ahead so far, and got a room with mold and dead bugs, and he told me very loudly that it was all MY fault about the mold, dead bug smears and loud reception because I didn't complain early enough.

The apartment is on the 3rd floor (and there is no lift), but it was about the same price as 2 reasonably priced hotel rooms and had a kitchen, bathroom, and dining room. The staff were really helpful and the location was fabulous - 1 minute walk to the fish market, fresh fruit/veg stalls, and the Rialto Mercado vaporetto stop. San Marco was a 15 minute walk away through lots of atmospheric alleys. On the last night we moved to another 2 BR 2 bath apartment about 5 minutes walk away run by the same people - it was recently renovated and very comfy and stylish. The only room for improvement was breakfast - just croissants, rolls, juice, coffee, cereal, and yogurt; not bad, but it got old after a couple days.

We had been to Venice before and were looking for something affordable. I came upon this apartment as part of the Pensione Guerrato website but could not find out much information about it so I wanted to share our experience! The apartment is in a great part of town- between San Marco and Rialto. It is off a quiet square with a good restaurant right outside and plenty more to choose from in the vicinity. There are two rooms- one large bedroom with a queen size comfortable bed and one room which has the kitchen and two twin beds. The bathroom was large and comfortable. There was a heat/AC unit that you could actually control yourself- we have stayed in budget European hotels before and paid for AC only to find it didn't really cool anything. The kitchen has refrigerator, microwave, table, 4 chairs and enough dishes and utensils to eat a simple meal. This was wonderful as we would frequently pick up pizza, panini or something else and eat at home to save on money. The website for the Piccolo Guerrato says that breakfast is included for guests but it wasn't- we were forwarned by another review. We decided to try breakfast there anyway for $5/ person since we had two hungry teenagers. Breakfast was a good deal as there was plenty to choose from for an Italian hotel breakfast and we ate it all! In the end we only ended up paying $10/ day for all of us for breakfast. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. I would not recommend this apartment for the traveler that needs a front desk for constant directions, ticket purhases etc. But if you are an experienced traveller that has a good sense of direction and a willingness to find things on your own it was perfect.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, AB", "Title": "\u201cA breath of fresh air in busy Venice!\u201d", "Author": "momfromcalgary", "ReviewID": "UR35353418", "Content": "We stayed here for one night after we finished a cruise.

In the end, we decided that we loved the location -- situated over the daily fresh market along the Grand Canal and just a short walk to the Rialto Bridge....close to all the action. Restaurants were plentiful in the area and excellent shopping was available just steps from the hotel, and over/ around/ beyond the Rialto bridge. St. Marks is an easy and pleasant walk through the interesting streets. From our window we had a delightful view over ancient Venice roof tops complete with cooing pigeons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a treat to open our window every morning. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. They allowed us to leave our luggage in the lobby after checking out, before our late night train to Paris. I must say the Guerrato is a bargain in a city that easily commands $500 a night for accommodations that travelers continue to register complaints about. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult for hoteliers to keep everything in working order and updated--- even at the most expensive hotels. While the Guerrato wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one of our favorites during or 4 week Italy trip, we appreciated a clean, quiet, safe, efficient place to stay at an affordable price. Guerrato fit that bill. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I would stay here again unless my travel budget dictated that I sacrifice some comfort for price. I may want to pay a little more for comfort and a touch more luxury.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGood Value in Venice\u201d", "Author": "volcanolover", "ReviewID": "UR12332664", "Content": "We had a room for 4 on the 1st floor, so no view.

Very pleasant folks at the desk, room (a triple) large and very comfortable. Good lighting. Hot water, good towels. Good breakfast View down ancient alley.

The instructions they give you for getting to and from the Pensione and the apartment are to leave everyone at the Rialto vaporetto stop. come to the Pensione and collect the key, pick up your party and head out for the apartment. This is good advice and sounds like a bit of a bother. It isn't at all. I walked over the Rialto and down the street for 2 minutes and found the Pensione with no trouble. I let them know we were going to join them for breakfast (5 Euros per person) and left with the keys. Walked back across the Rialto, picked up my party and cruised to the apartment following directions from the front desk staff. Friendly and good English. The apartment is very clean, and warm once you turn on the hot water/heater. I didn't ask about it but we figured it out quickly. The controls are in the kitchen which is well equipped. It's located near a church and has a lovely view of the piazza. We picked up food to keep in the refrigerator which could be reheated in the microwave for a snack. This turned out to be a good option because the dining in Venice was pricey. We liked having the freedom to come and go without passing back the key. The kids slept in the kitchen on two twin beds. Our bedroom was one of the largest I had during my trip, as was the bathroom. We were easy walking distance to St Mark's and the Rialto. We had a blast getting lost. One night we got lucky enough to hear a serenade from a gondolier as they rowed under the bridge. Amazing.
