The studios themselves are extremely clean, have quiet air conditioning, and are well equipped for basic self catering (though not fully equipped for cooking meals), have plenty of storage room and are very safe feeling. All the staff at the Atenea are multi lingual and very welcoming and friendly - you can't take this for granted in Spain as we have found elsewhere to our cost. There are two PC terminals set up in the lobby and internet use is free. The rooms are relatively basic but the shining star is the beautiful pool area - I spent full days here just relaxing, sunbathing and enjoying the lovely atmosphere. There is loads of room for everybody to get a sun lounger, and the gardens are kept absolutely immaculate by the hard working staff. Vilanova itself is a wonderful little resort, mainly visited by the Spanish themselves. It's ideal forfamilies with kids and for couples but probably not a good choice for single sex groups looking to party. We discovered a wonderful 'Ramblas', much nicer than Barcelona's, and with loads of great shops and cafes. Vilanova is generally cheaper then resorts such as Sitges, and has a more laid back vibe in my opinion. There was quite a lot of building going on when we visited, and it will be interesting to see how Vilanova looks in years to come. We felt we had discovered a 'hidden gem'!We have visited the Atenea Park twice now and will probably go back again. It's only a few steps from the beach yet on a quiet street, and is really in the perfect location for exploring the coast and Barcelona, as it's a very easy and cheap train journey to all destinations. I'd recommend it to anybody. Only drawback for us was the rooms have single beds which took a bit of getting used to, but hardly a deal breaker.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR259923269", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "oatybix"}, {"Content": "well much to our annoyance the pool was closed untill 1st may for the spannish holiday then it opened as we were going home .breakfast never changed the whole week hotel is nice and clean rooms bar in hotel only open from 8 till10 at night vilanova is what i would say is a quiet place nice beach would not rush back but would not tell anybody not to go nice chinese called palacio ocean on sea front and good shops on the ramblas in the middle of the town .did enjoy ourselfs but the whole place could have had more life to it", "Date": "May 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR428394669", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ocheye"}, {"Content": "Clean and Spacious We have just returned from a long weekend at the Atenea Park Apartments in Vilanova I La Geltru.

We bought mugs of our own so that we could have a decent size cup of tea - made using our travel kettle. There were hardly any utensils at all, not even a spoon to stir anything with - other than a general eating spoon.

Well, where shall I start?The apartholtel as it was advertised is clean - one of the cleanest (if not the best) that I have stayed in to date. The cleaners are brutal!. The location is spot-on in terms of restuarants and the beautiful beach. However, the entertainment is non-existent. This is a major downside if you have children. Also, don't expect too much from the on-site restuarant itself. Albeit, they do good food, you would be much better off walking down the road and placing yourself in one of the many nice fish restuarants.There is no pool-side bar for drinks/snacks other than the restaurant which is not stocked very well. There's a hut at the back which advertises entertainment for the kids but I nevr saw it open once in the 11 days that I was there.Staff are very friendly but I had asked for some bigger cups for some tea (espresso cups for a tea bag is impossible!). I asked 3 times over 3 days and none were coming other than if we have them they'll be in your room by now. It took me to sweet-talk the restuarant manager to hand over 2 bigger cups to get them. They also state that the rooms are well equipped........... well, apart from a 2-ring electric hob and a fridge, do NOT expect anything else. No oven, no kettle no toaster etc etc.In addtion to this, I had booked a room for 3 people. Be careful here as my 2-year old had to sleep on the sofa for 10 nights. Which I think was the better option as the beds are a bit on the hard side.All said and done, although basic is was what I consider fairly good value in terms of cleanliness and location.A visit to Sitges is a must as is Tarragona. Be prepared to get lost in Barcelone City Centre (especially if you have a car). If driving, buy a VERY GOOD map as the roadsigns in Spain are.....hmmmmmmmmmmm, fairly non-existent and when they are there, somewhat confusing - especially in the city centre.Beautiful country, people are friendly, the area has not been damaged by overseas tourists so far (thank god) so, be prepared to take your Spanish terms book everywhere with youas English is not wide-spread at all.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR567117582", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MADNBAD"}, {"Content": "Great Views, Great Place The apartments were just what we were looking for.
