The coffee was terrible. The continental breakfast consisted of muffins. There were very few, and they weren't that great. The pool was down the whole time we stayed. Our bath tub had jets in it, that did not work. When we took a bath, it filled with disgusting pieces of crud from the jets. There were very few cable channels. The neighborhood was pretty terrible as well. To make everything worse, I'm now itching all over.

The towels were so thin I had to ask for 2 extra towels. There was no coffee maker.There were 2 bedside lamps and one had a bulb burned out. The toilet was yellow with rust.However, the front desk people were extremely nice. That and the fact that the mattress was decent and it was the only room we could find so close to a big event in Indi were the only reasons we even stayed there. I would NOT go back again.

The room furnishings were old but decently comfortable and the WiFi worked very well. The bathroom was functional but seemed to be rotting away, probably from the humidity.

There are no non-smoking rooms in this hotel. So if this is an issue with you avoid this place. Also there were other issues. The property was very run down with no air-conditioning in common areas such as lobby, halls, breakfast area. Breakfast was another issue. It consisted of some juice or coffee and some really old bagels. The second day we skipped it entirely, not worth getting up for. My friend's room didn't even have a television!!!

It now goes by Sunrise Hotel! Since we have been going to this hotel it has went from Quailty Inn...to Shadeland Inn...to Econo Lodge East...to now the Sunrise Hotel. On, Sept. 10, 2005, we have stayed at this hotel as it has went through many name/owner changes. We go with a large group every September for a race. We fill up nearly the entire hotel. This year I had read the reviews and went against my better judgement and went ahead and made our reservations one month prior to our trip. I reguested a pool side room since the pool is in doors...that was not a problem. When we checked in...they had lost my reservation, I had my confirmation number so they had to give me the price I had been given and not the new jacked up price they tried to give me. Our room was not ready so we had to come back in 2 hours...so we did. When I picked up my room key at the front desk I was pointed to a sign that told me that the pool was CLOSED for renovations. (why wasn't I told this when I made my reservations? I would not have paid more for this room!) The room itself was not as bad as I expected after reading the reviews....until I went into the bathroom (which was not until mearly midnight)! OH MY GOD...The shower was nothing more than a wall of MOLD...at base of the tub the cover was about 2-3 inches to small, the toilet was pulled out away from the wall by about 5-6 inches. I wish we would have went into the restroom when we first arrived and dropped off our belongings...we would have just left then! We got back to our room at nearly midnight. We needed to at least rince off and brush our teeth, go to the restroom...normal things any family would expect to do in a hotel room. Well not without WATER! That is right...no water! I went down to the front desk...I was told that they had to turn it off for a minute but that would have it back on within 45 minutes. So we brushed out teeth with a bottle a water we had with us and went to bed. The next morning I got up first...went to the rest room and once again NO WATER! When we complain to the front desk again...we were told that they were sorry and that there was a leak. Not to be rude but honestly that is not my problem and I paid for a room with water and didn't get one. I want my money back!!! I was told it was out of their control. Don't do the same thing I did and blow off these reviews...it will save you more than money! While I have gotton NO where with the hotel in trying to retrieve my money, I have posted this review, contacted the BBB, contacted the Indiana Fire Marshall, my local televesion stations \"Troubleshooter\", I have written a letter to the hotel in care of the Owner/Operator, Have written the Indiana State Dept. of health, and plan to still write letters to the editors of every Indianapolis newspaper. I have a big mouth...and I aint affraid to use it! I am sure I will cost them far more in loss of business than if they would have just gave me my money back!

The outside is very deceiving. We were there in April, 2005. Our hotel room was disgusting and in disrepair. The plumbing in the bathroom was backwards - when we ran the shower, the water ran all over the bathroom floor. The vent and all other metal surfaces were rusted. The wood was peeling. The tub was moldy and gross. The front desk was SO not accomodating. I asked for extra pillows which the manager himself said he'd bring to our room in 30 minutes. He never did. I went back an hour later and the manager was gone and the front desk clerk told me he didn't have a key so I couldn't get any pillows. HUH?? Customer service?? Then, there was a party happening in the pool area RIGHT OUTSIDE our hotel room - I mean, literally on the other side of the patio doors. There was drinking, loud music and clanging beer bottles. We could not sleep. I had to call the front desk (starting at 12:30am) FOUR TIMES to get the security guard to take care of it. We heard the drunk partyers laughing and swearing at the guard. We have two young children - we were literally scared that these people would come and find us. It was frightening.
