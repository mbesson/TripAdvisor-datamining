Back then I found the hotel adequate for the money they charged. Even their shared bathroom was clean and nice. This March I stayed at Julia again (as it was chosen by my friends I have been travelling with). I must say that their reception personnel are as good as they were in 2008. They are friendly and helpful and attentive! No complaints here! As to all other aspects the hotel has been a real disappointment! The two things that struck me most were: 1. Cockroaches in the bathroom. They were of different sizes (mostly small ones) and during every visit to bathroom I was killing at least a couple. 2. The hotel has serious problems with water supply system. You just can\u2019t take a normal shower. The water keeps changing temperature from hot to ice cold. And on one of the mornings hot water stopped running at all. We could not even take a normal shower, not to mention washing our hair! You can imagine how disappointing this was! Sleep quality was bad. One of our matrasses was worn out and knobby, the other was sliding off the bed all the time. Breakfasts were manageable, but really nothing special. One day ham smelled really funny and was cut in a suspicious way. I did not take the risk eating it. I really hate to write these terrible things about this hotel. But I hope it would induce their management to get rid of insects in the rooms and to place boilers (which are not really expensive) so that guests could count on such basic things as hot shower. This is not a 3-star hotel!

In the morning it was painful to shower and go from delicious warm water into an ice cold room. I went down to complain about the heat and was told that there is central heating in the hotel and that later in the day housekeeping would check the heat in my room. I received no apology, no mention of a reduction in the bill due to the absence of a basic necessity, but just a blank look. There were not enough chairs in the breakfast room so I had to bring up my food on a paper plate and eat in my freezing room. I returned that night and the room was slightly better on first inspection. I was able to sleep only using a heavy sweater, but when I woke up the room was cold again.

Basically the staff's assistance from there was not expected for 106 Euros a night. They were completely unhelpful when asked for assistance for anything.

My experience was a pleasant one. All I wanted was a place to sleep. Who goes to Rome to spend a lot of time in their hotel room? The breakfast was adequate. Decent variety, plenty available; but the same \"menu\" the entire week I stayed there. It started getting \"old\" after a week. Still, quantity and variety was sufficient. Usually, I went down to eat breakfast when they first opened at 7:30. At that time, there was only me or one/two other couples in the dining room. One morning, due to staying out late, I didn't get down to breakfast until 8:30/9:00. I was surprised to see the dining room completely full and several people had to wait a few minutes for an available table. My room was one of the smaller rooms with the shower down the hall. It was quite small, but then again, I only went there to sleep. The bed was quite old, but very firm. I sleep well. The room and toilet/sink room was very clean. No complaints about the cleanliness of the room. The bracket holding the rod for hanging cloths broke right away and I reported it to the front desk, (taking a picture of the broken bracket with my camera to show them). This was on a Saturday evening. By Tuesday, the bracket was fixed. To me, with stores being closed on Sunday, that was pretty good service. Until the bracket was fixed, I just hung my slacks over the back of the chair and hung my shirts on the coat hooks attached to the wall. The shower room was very clean and the whole week I was in residence, I never saw anyone else use the shower room. The heat of the water was good. Hotter than what I needed. Some of the previous reviews mentioned the hotel being \"noisy\". Well . . . what would one expect from being in the middle of a very dense urban environment in a culture where being outdoors is a way of life. The room did not have air conditioning, (that I was aware of). I kept he window open the whole time and did hear a lot of noise. Romans tend to honk their car horns often, and people talk when walking. The lanes are narrow, so noise echoes easily. Still, it should be expected that noise will be something that will have to be endured due to the location. After walking about town all day, even with the noise and hard bed, I still slept soundly. The staff were all first-rate! All speak English quite well, even if a couple were self-conscious about their abilities. The only staff member who I wasn't sure spoke English was the young lady who brought food out to the breakfast table and cleared the dishes after people left. Only reason I don't know if she spoke English is that I tried to communicate in Italian as much as possible and the occasion did not occur where I spoke to her in English. The front desk staff were quite fluent, and even helped me learn a few Italian phrases. I rented a bicycle for several days, (great way to see Rome, if you are not timid about the traffic). I was not allowed to keep the bicycle in my room, (safety reasons), and the staff let me keep the bicycle in a secure location in the back rooms until I retrieved it the second day. They were very helpful in helping me select a cycling route to visit a few of the places I wanted to travel by bicycle to, (Ostia Antica and Via Appia Antica). The front desk staff was also very helpful in obtaining information about opening and closing times of various venues I wanted to visit. They have a internet connected computer at the front desk and are more than willing to look up something for you. (I understand that the hotel provides wireless connectivity, but I did not have an occasion to utilize it. I think they have a small cubby with a computer available to guests, but again, I was not in Rome to web surf.) Bottom line...fantastic location, (about three blocks from Trevi), very helpful staff, clean rooms, a breakfast to keep you going all day ... but don't expect luxury.

Air conditioning worked, but it would either be hot or cold during the night.

It wasn't the worst hotel I've ever stayed in but it certainly was nowhere near the best. Pros: Location-this is probably the best feature of the hotel. It is so central, only got the metro once and other than that walked everywhere. Clean-hotel room was spotless Shower-was really powerful. Cons: The noise-this for me was the biggest factor. The hotel room was stifling hot(in January!!) and the radiator couldn't be turned off so we had no choice but to have the window a little open(it didn't close properly anyway so we couldn't have closed it). From 7.30 every morning the noise outside was crazy. I realise the outside noise was outside the hotels control but when we asked about changing to a different room they moved to us to the exact same room a floor up!!! Had lost the will to fight it at this stage and the second room wasn't so hot so we could leave the window closed. The staff- I have to say that the staff at the hotel were quite abrupt, they were never rude but just not friendly at all. I asked the first night about where the nearest internet cafe was and was told that there was a computer available for guests use. Great perk which I really appreciated. I was waiting on an urgent e-mail so once each day asked if I could use the internet and each time felt like I was bothering them. By the 4th day of my stay I felt so uncomfortable asking that I just found an internet cafe instead. Breakfast- practically non-existant. Croissants, corn flakes and some juice might be left if you were lucky. Not a major issue but certainly not a selling point of the hotel. Overall, the hotel was fine and you get what you pay for but next time I travel to Rome I would sooner pay a little extra for something that bit \"nicer\"", "Date": "January 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "pacebene", "ReviewID": "UR22634684", "Content": "Hotel Julia is in a great location.

Piazza Venizia and other sites are not very much further. Plenty of food, shopping, transport & conveniences around the corner. The room was tiny with a tiny window overlooking a back street. The bathroom was functional and clean like the room. No fridge however there was a barely functioning airconditioner. Bed was small and uncomfortable. The room was quiet apart from some repeated door banging early one morning. The breakfast was terrible! While all hotels in Italy only do continental style breakfast, this was by far the worst we had. The breadrolls were disgusting and looked like an insect nest inside! (affectionately known thereafter as 'insect bread'), some lousy ham, plastic cheese, sour yoghurt and dishwater coffee. Ham, cheese & coffee are impossible screw up in Italy!!!! We rarely spent any time in the room but made full use of the convenient location but not much else. Staff were reasonably friendly but not very helpful with information. They did not even know that there is a laundromat/internet point in the next street over. My advice would be to skip breakfast, enjoy the location but try to get the best deal possible as you do not get much for your money apart from location. We paid \u20ac88/night mid August but refused to pay \u20ac135/night when we tried to book a night in September on our way out.

I signed for 3 nights and quickly made my exit with my wife. FACT - When I returned home they had illegally taken two transactions from my account, one for three-nights (which I'd signed for) and the other a sum equivalent to the fourth-night they had agreed I could have for free FACT - They tried to fob Mastercard off by explaining it was a charge for not showing up on the first night, which was a lie FACT - I got my money back.

Campalognia maybe a 20 minute walk. Plaza Navarro maybe another 5 -7minute walk. Granted I went to Rome during the off season, so the streets weren't as crowded as they could be but they were crowded due to the Olympics being in Italy. For bad reviews of the room I just don't understand what most folks are looking for. As anyone knows most true European hotel rooms are not spacious like in the United States. But it was quiet and my room had a sink and toilet in it. The check in people were really nice especially Stephan and Ann. Their english is very good, but I watched all the agents speak in various different languages. The continental breakfast was tasty. Nothing to rave about, but kept me full for most of the day.
