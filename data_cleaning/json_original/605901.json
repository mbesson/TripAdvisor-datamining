My mom and I are travelling together this summer, and we decided to leave our visit with family a few days earlier than planned (as my stomach couldn't handle the one hour train ride from Surrey to London) so we wanted to find a reasonably priced hotel close to central London. I found the Elephant and Castle Eurotraveller online for 99 pounds/night. We stayed in room number 3, the ground floor which worried me at first as I thought that it would be noisy, but it wasn't a problem at all. A few times we heard people walking by (as we kept our window open), but no noise late at night. The bed was comfortable, as was the standing shower. The bathroom was quite a good size. The flat screen tv on the wall was in a great place as we could sit in bed and watch a bit of tv before falling asleep. Location, was only about five blocks from the Elephant and Castle Tube Station, however, if you have heavy suitcases like we do, I would suggest that you take a bus from another tube station to get to the hotel. E&C station was a huge pain to pull heavy suitcases up quite a few sets of stairs. The bus stops are only a half block up the street, and run very frequently so we ended up taking the bus more often than the tube! I'm not sure that my mom felt totally comfortable in the neighbourhood, but I felt fine there. As for staff service, it was fantastic! I'm surprised to read that others had such bad service as we had one guy (I feel bad as I don't know his name) bend over backwards for us when we first arrived. Our fan was making a weird noise so he went and got us a new one, and he grabbed us more towels and pillows. Whenever we wanted to know how to get somewhere, he would google it, and then print out the directions for us! We plan to stay here again at the end of August before we fly back home.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Room, shame about the staff\u201d", "Author": "swimmingotta", "ReviewID": "UR116119927", "Content": "We stayed at the Eurotraveller for a week while finalising moving our move to Australia.

Double room Number 4 on the ground floor. Both the bedroom and bathroom were clean and well kept and certainly ample in size. Nice TV located on the wall and a huge bonus was the quality of the fan (June 27th was a scorcher so it was most appreciated). Such a shame that the ceiling has two holes in it that have been crudely covered over with A4 pieces of paper! I note that an early review on another site has mentioned this as well, so clearly the owners are not particularly bothered about such tackiness. Worst thing, though, is that room 4 is right next to either an air conditioning motor or some sort of generator, the noise was constant, loud and made for a restless nights sleep. It's also worth mentioning that the ground floor rooms have windows that once open, can easily be accesed by the more determined snooper. Meaning that in the summer when you need them open, anyone can peer or reach in to your room. On the pus side the staff were always friendly. I feel I must defend the area since it's been called into question in many other reviews. This is South London, not Central London, as reflected in the price to stay in this hotel. Walworth, Kennington and Elephant & Castle surround the Euro Traveller, and all three areas are cosmopolitan but never threatening. The hotel is in between two main roads, Walworth Road and Kennington Park Road. We used the pubs on and around Kennington Park Road and had a lovely time. Kennington Tube Station is a 10 minute walk away and there's a ream of buses that stop on the road to take you all over the place. For breakfast at a reasonable price, there is the Amore cafe which is situated on the Walworth Road and is located right by the hotel.So need to pay the overpriced rate (\u00c2\u00a39) the hotel charges for what apparently is a less than fulfilling breakfast. It's a better than average budget hotel, one that just needs a bit more care and attention to things like safety, noise and asthetics. 3/5", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tamworth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBlack mold and pubic hair in the blocked up shower !!!\u201d", "Author": "sambirchy", "ReviewID": "UR114792081", "Content": "You'd think my title would say it all !! , but you are wrong avoid the eurotraveller hotel in elephant and castle !!! , me and my friends were looking forward to a weekend away to watch glee at the O2. However despite being in a rough area, the hotel looked nice on the out side We were greeted by rude staff , we then entered the room, and my eye sight was assaulted by the cheap and distasteful decor, also I was taken aback by the fact that we had book three single beds and we were greeted by a single and double. However what had distracted us from the disappointment of the bed situation was the brutal assault on our sense of smell on entering the bathroom!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were privy to the gut wrenching smell of sewage, whilst I was bursting for the toilet I held my nose trying to thing of the weekend ahead, I noticed the shower had water pooling in it from a blocked plug , upon closer inspection there was a black mould like substance floating the water , as well as pubic hair . We had to rush out thinking we could sort this out later, we arrived back and complained , the night manager didn't believe us so he checked our room and agreed it shouldn't be like that , it took us 2 hours to get him to move us as he was offering to clean it up , and apparently the sister hotel on old Kent road was \" Full\" but this suggestion still rendered the shower useless and his only suggestion was wait for people to check out in the morning and use there shower. So in total we phoned approximately 30 hotels and hostels and all were full , as by magic all of a sudden a room was free at the eurotraveller on old Kent road , on transferring to that hotel at 01:30 in the morning paying for our own taxi , we eventually got to the new hotel and room , it was clear that this \" cabin\" was what the chain classed as a luxury room , and it became more apparent this was the reason we were told they were full due to the price difference of the rooms booked .

The first night I arrived very tired after working 14 hours and was due to start at 7.30am the next day so was looking forward to a good sleep. I asked for a quiet room at the back but instead got put in a room opposite 3 very loud drunken northern labourers who had bought women back picked up from the pub. If that wasn't bad enough the guy next door had a prostitute visiting so there was the noise from both sides. I was so tired and couldnt be bothered to move and got very little sleep. I complained the next morning and was moved to another room which was supposed to be better. I went to the office and worked late again and went back even more tired hoping to get a good rest but there were 2 drunk females in the room next door who were very loud till early hours of the morning dispite me banging on the wall to ask them to be quiet. If all that wasn't bad enough the fire alarm went off in the room at 6.30am I dressed and grabbed my stuff and went to reception only to be told that it went off due to someone having a hot shower in another room. I have complained about my stay but the hotel have done nothing at all. The next 4 days of work I stayed at the Brittania International at Canary Wharf and it was like another world with nice beds and peace and quiet.

There was a constant supply of shampoo and soap in the bathroom that they refilled daily and there was a coffee maker and tea in the bedroom. Although it wasn't the most desirable bathroom and shower, there are no real complaints. There was no breakfast at the hotel, but there are restaurants and McDonalds around the corner. The bus stop for a 24 hour bus was about 10 steps away and the ride into the city was about 10 minutes. I never like staying too far from the center but this was amazingly convenient (the bus routes are so easy to follow). When it was time to leave, we had nothing to access internet on, so the reception let us go behind the desk to look up bus times and called and arranged a cab for us to leave for the airport at 330am.

There are no decent restaurants in the neighborhood --it's a rough area. The hotel is small, the rooms are very very small and the beds are so lumpy that the back pain was excruciating. We are talking 20 year old mattresses. The TV is a whopping 13 inch older unit. The bathroom cabinet was missing the doors. There is no closet or dresser. The walls are so thin you can hear snoring through them not to mention any other activities. If another room has their windows open and the people are talking they may as well be in your room--but don't count on them speaking English since it seems to be a favorite haunt for foreigners also seeking a bargain.
