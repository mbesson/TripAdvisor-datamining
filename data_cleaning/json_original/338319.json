As we are both students, we needed a budget style accommodation. As you may have discovered, hotels in Singapore are extremely expensive due to the shortage of land and high cost/quality of life. Within the budget hotels range, Chinatown is at the top. It is located in the nicer district and is more safe. We did examine other accommodations such as Pearl and Ruby, but these motels are quite scary. So Chinatown was the best we could get. Here is the thing: if you are a student on a budget, this is the best choice you can make. If you are willing to spend a little more, you can get a much better hotel through a travel agent by adding around 15USD more per night. Since we live in Taiwan, room size was not an issue for us. The room was reasonably sized with adequate lighting and a working air conditioner. The rest was disappointing. The bed cover had a huge stain in the middle. For peace of mind, we assumed it was spilled coffee, though based on the dirt inside the coffee machine, I doubt it was used in the last century. The actual bedding was clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable. What irritated me the most was the shower. Yes the shower is not separated from the toilet area, but if you visited Hong Kong, its nothing special. The problem was, the hot water did not flow properly so we had to shower under a tiny stream of water. Our first experience with housekeeping was also disappointing. We were still in our room at 10am when housekeeper showed up. We asked her to come back later, but she stated that it aint gonna happen. Again we kept our positive spirits and traded some dirty towels in exhange for fresh ones. The second day an older lady was cleaning the place and she was much nicer and did a wonderful job restocking the room and providing us with clean bedding. We did not see any roaches, be it ants or cockroaches. In short, if you just need a place to sleep, Chinatown hotel is acceptable, but if you want more, this is not a place for you. If you demand nothing and expect nothing, you should have an OK stay. The hotel is safe and hotel desk staff is nice (depending on who is onsite, but hey its Singapore). Since its unfair to end on a sad note, I would say the location of the hotel is quite nice, near Chinatown station, within 25 minute walk from the docks and entertainment district, on the purple line that gets you to all major destinations. Chinatown is 5 minutes walk. The hotel is situated within a quiet street and has a few bars around, some more fancy than others. Occasional working lady was spotted in the vicinity but it is not frequent.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cBugs-Ants Paradise!\u201d", "Author": "Joeykeong", "ReviewID": "UR116784944", "Content": "Book a room from through travel agent from China for good location & value for money hotel located in Chinatown area for 4 nights....
