I was pleasantly surprised to have gotten the Doubletree! This hotel is by far one of the nicest (if not the nicest) airport hotel at Sea-Tac. The facility is a tower plus several small buildings surrounding a swimming pool and hot tub. One of the buildings backs onto a small lake, and there's almost a park-like atmosphere around the hotel. I arrived at a very very busy hotel, as the weather was bad and there were several flights either cancelled or delayed. Check-in was fast, and professional - and they give you warm chocolate chip cookies upon arrival! My room was spacious, very clean, and comfortable - especially after a treacherous drive down from Vancouver. My only complaint about the room was that the drain on my tub was VERY slow (to the point of being completely clogged), so I was showering in a puddle the entire time. The bed was fantastic. I went for dinner in the lounge/restaurant - that was extremely busy due to the weather cancellations - my server was very professional albeit personable and friendly! She made a great dinner suggestion for me, and as I was dining alone - I ended up sharing my table with a couple lovely Alaska Airlines flight attendants who were also \"stuck\" at the hotel. Check out was quick and easy, and I think they gave me more cookies! The shuttle driver to the airport was professional and courteous!

However, this 5th floor Tower two queen bed room was MUCH better than the first room we were assigned which we refused to stay in. I have stayed with this same hotel 3 times now and this third time I was initially assigned into an awful room. It was located, as memory serves me correctly, on the 3rd floor in the 4th building. Never mind, it was a very difficult and a very, long walk to access these rooms but when I opened the door the room was completely unacceptable. First, the prices--room rates have increased--since my last stay in June 2011. The price was 119.00 per King and now with the AAA card was approx. 144.00. The function that I was attending in Seattle was housed at the Holiday Inn Express hotel for 89.00 an evening and we attendees were reimbursed for the stay. I opted NOT to stay there but at the Doubletree Inn instead. When I entered the room originally assigned to us in the 4th building third floor, it was no better or cleaner than a roadside Holiday Inn Express. Old, tired looking, smelly and small, scuffed up and a very, very long walk from the front desk and restaurant. More of a motel room one would find along the roadside of a highway. I then called the front desk however, no answer after 20 rings. I then struggled with my luggage all the way back to the front desk and my husband and I insisted on being located in the Tower section whereas this is the area I have always stayed previously. The gentleman, I believe front desk manager, agreed to change us to the new location and we were appreciative but I can assure you that I will NEVER stay in any rooms other than the Tower section at this hotel. These are referred to as the Deluxe rooms. The room we finally settled in the Tower 5th floor had several issues that were wrong. The TV remote control was not working for my husband and he called for another. The other issue being the air fan in the ceiling above the second or foyer sink made a rattling noise and was very loud and unsettling in which we had to adjust the temperature setting in the room to make it stop. Lastly, the toilet handle easily gets stuck and the toilet will run, continuously and loudly, until you return to move the handle. The food in the hotel is quite good. We had the Halibut and the Salmon and began with the chowder soup and the food has always been consistent and tasty even at our previous stays. Lastly, it is ridiculous that this hotel charges for Internet\u2014WiFi-- service for guests.

We didn't arrive at the hotel until almost 11:00 PM but it didn't take a few minutes to check in. I was shocked to learn that the hotel has several pods or wings attached to it with rooms.

If we had wanted to walk back to the main hotels it would have taken forever and a very good map. As I was walking down the hall to my room, I noticed this loud humming noice in the ceiling. I figured it had something to do with the pipes or wiring in the ceiling. I stepped into my room and was very surprised. The room was huge with a balcony which looked out onto a lake. The bathroom was big with two vanities which made it nice if you were traveling with another person. I could still hear the humming in my room which was very loud in the bathroom area. I thought about asking for another room but it was already midnight and I needed to get up early in the morning. The bed was very nice and soft with nice linens but I couldn't sleep. I often travel with earplugs so I put them in but I could still hear the humming. I finally put a pillow over my ears along with the earplugs and went to sleep. The next morning I could still hear the loud humming and was happy to check out of the room. I went to meet my traveling companion in his room to meet him before checking out. His room was not as nice as mine. It seemed old and outdated. The balcony to the room was right on the parking lot which would be a privacy issue to me.

We flew-in to Seattle from St Louis and arrived at the airport around 12:15pm. We finally found Island 3 (the airport is under construction but basically, for now, you walk across the landing and take the elevator down, like you are going toward the parking garage). The big, comfy shuttle bus arrived and I was a surprised at how nice and big it was. The bus had about ten airline crew members it was dropping off. It picked-up us, some more airline crew members, and a few other guests. We arrived at the hotel in just a few minutes (as it is literally sitting on the airport runway). We were slow getting off the bus so we were last to check-in but from the very start, they gave us a wonderful impression \u2013 they had four or five ladies checking people in as fast as possible \u2013 and they were fast! In less than five minutes we had two warm chocolate chip cookies and two room key cards. Our room was at the VERY VERY back of the hotel also known as wing 5, fourth floor. Yes, it is a long walk. My husband & I are exercise freaks and it shows and we made the walk just fine, no problem\u2026 with lots of very nice maids offering us advice/assistance along the way if we got lost. It was easy breezy and the quiet room and the lake view were worth the little walk. We were going to use the free shuttle (which leaves every hour at like 2:05, 3:05, etc) to go to the Westfield/Southcenter mall which is HUGE but my sister, who lives in the area, just picked us up and we all went to the Cheesecake Factory (attached to the mall) for dinner. We walked around the mall after and hubby bought some sandals. We got back to the hotel and stopped in the gift shop to buy soda or water but decided not too when we realized the soda machines (and ice machine, btw) next to our room were cheaper \u2013 only $1.25 in the machines versus $1.99 in the store \u2013 not a big deal but fyi. I used the Internet to update my blog and instead of paying for 24-hour usage, I just put in my room number for one hour usage at $4.95 \u2013 plenty of time to update my blog and saved me $10 (it's 14.95 for 24-hour usage). The Internet was wireless and VERY fast. They have wired hookups on the desk area also if you need them. We had prepaid for this room and got a FANTASTIC rate for a smoking king. At check-in we had to show a credit card for a $50 hold for incidentals. The next morning our final bill \u2013 for $4.95 \u2013 was under our door. They had charged the card we gave them for the Internet access and released the other $45. Easy breezy. We had a great view, a comfy bed, a quiet room, a decent sized balcony, great service, and a nice no-brainer stay. We would stay here again in a second. Also, we walked by a Starbucks inside the hotel that seemed popular, two restaurants, a bar, a huge outdoor pool (it must be heated?) and a very large hot tub that was steaming since it was cool outside when we stayed here. Everything looked to be maintained very well and I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel. For the record, I am a hotel snob and we try to only stay at Hilton properties. I am a little surprised at some of the other reviews saying this hotel is \u201cold\u201d and etc. Also \u2013 directly across from the hotel and an easy-easy walk away is a Denny\u2019s, 711, Taco Bell, several other fast food places, and a Liquor & Wine store (Seattle does not sell hard liquor on Sundays, fyi). My only complaint\u2026 the next morning we needed to be at the airport before 7am to meet our shuttle driver to take us into downtown Seattle. The bus driver the next morning was cranky and in a bad mood. There was a big crowd (with luggage) waiting for him when he arrived and apparently, he wasn\u2019t in the mood to do his job. My husband got ticked at him for ignoring him and saying something about this being another \u201cbad Monday\u201d \u2013 I wish we had not tipped him at all, frankly. This was the only negative thing I can say as the bus driver we had the previous day was wonderful. We did, however, make it to the airport easily and in plenty of time \u2013 despite the driver again complaining when he had to drop us off first and he realized he had piled my bag under two others. He was the only sour note to a sweet stay!", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas", "Title": "\u201csuch a comfortable hotel by airport\u201d", "Author": "ima_lamp", "ReviewID": "UR119203749", "Content": "this hotel was so comfortable.

After a rocky start finding the right shuttle, everything else was fantastic. We arrived at the hotel and were warmly greeted by the Front Desk Staff and given warm cookies. Wish they came without nuts. The room was very nice with lots of space. We even had a little balcony which we would have used if the weather had been nicer. That evening we enjoyed a cocktail in the bar and the bartender was fantastic. The next morning our server for breakfast was very attentive. The only downside was the gentleman manning the concierge desk. We were asking directions to the Public Market and a pub we were interested in trying.

The check-in was wonderful, the staff great, and the hotel itself was nice. The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers). And they add a $3 tip on top of the 18% (and then all the regular taxes are there, too). So a burger and soup were $32, and it was a very. VERY average burger. Total rip-off with the excess charges. I did not use daily housekeeping and was able to get what I needed when I saw them in the halls. And the women I met were very, very friendly and polite. But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected. I did email Rissa, who took a day and a half (and two emails) to respond to me. She said all the blahblahblah and offered to change rooms, but I was halfway through my stay and changing rooms is a pain. This was a business trip so I was not looking for compensation on the room. I thought she may care a bit more with the pics as proof, but I guess they hear complaints all day. I did make sure to include all the positive I had to say as well. The internet fees are a HUGE scam-- $12-$15 for 24 hours. There is no way that they aren't banking money here. Parking is another point of contention but I did not park so not really going worry about this one. Overall, if this were MY money, I would NOT stay here. With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room. They don't even have microwaves or fridges in the rooms.

There are other places very near by that cost less and are less of a hassle. Let's start with the shuttle. Perhaps our negative experience with this colored the rest of our stay. I had called the hotel with questions about the shuttle and both the recording and the human told me to go to Island 1 or 3. The bus came regularly and had a big number 1 on it. It was 11:30 pm (2:30am to us) when we got to Island 3. It is really big and had several stops all labeled Island 3 Courtesy Shuttles. Not knowing which to choose we stood by the phone bank. We spent nearly 30 minutes staring into the bright headlights of the many courtesy vehicles searching for that Number 1. Nothing. Finally, I spot the Doubletree name in fairly small letters on a bus. There is no number. I leap into the street frantically waving and the bus stops. The driver tells us he is full and we will have to stand. Standing on the bus and getting to the hotel is preferable to another half hour of standing on the sidewalk and being blinded. It actually turned out well because last on was first off. Check in went quickly and smoothly since we are Hilton Honors members and there was a special line. (There must have been 30 parties behind us and I feel very sorry for them.) Our room was a reasonable distance from check in and there was a well-marked map on the key envelope. We needed it. Our room was fine. It was fairly large and overlooked a parking area and another building. We liked that the bathroom had two sinks. Airport noise was minimal. We slept well. We had $10 vouchers for breakfast because of our Diamond status. This would cover the continental breakfast buffet but including hot food would cost an additional $7 per person. When looking at ordering from the menu as an option, we found that tea and juice alone cost $8. One of the buffets was the only reasonably priced option. The yogurt was amazingly good and had many great toppings. The croissant was stale. This inconsistency in food quality was present in the hot offerings too. On the positive side, we had been told at check in that we should get a fruit and cheese plate but the kitchen was closed. The desk arranged for us to get it to go before we checked out. The shuttle back to the airport to pick up our rental car was excellent. There was no number 1on the bus but we saw a second bus which did have a number easily visible. We chose the Doubletree for this trip because the price was the same as a nearby Hampton but only because we did not have to park a car.

The hotel was supposedly full but a room was made available around 11:30 AM on Aug 28. I reserved two nights, since the earliest available flights left around 11:30 PM on Aug 29. My room had a faint smoky odor that was irritating to me, so I requested a change within a few minutes, and was moved to another room which seemed better, though it had a strong deodorizer smell. When I came back a few hours later, the deodorizer had worn off and the smoky/musty smell was more apparent. But I decided it was not worth complaining again, since I would only be sleeping there one night. The hotel employee told me that sometimes people smoke outside and the smell gets into the room. But I find that hard to believe. One reason I moved to this hotel was for the free internet terminals in the lobby, which I needed in order to rebook my flight. But, most of the time all four of them were busy - I don't think four terminals are sufficient for a hotel of this size. Eventually, I was able to find a free terminal after 11 PM and was able to rebook my flight for the next morning (Aug 29). Aside from the air quality, the room was better than the Comfort Inn. I did not get a chance to try the breakfast. When I checked out (at 5:45 AM on Aug 29), I was forced to pay a $50 early checkout fee. Had I known this, I would have only reserved one night at a time.

The salmon and clam chowder is a must eat if you are here - I've never had better. The Coffee Garden restaurant is a breakfast only location (except for conventions), and I recommend room service.

They appeared to not care about making the guest feel welcome, and when they closed early one day for a convention lunch they simply told people \"we're closed\" with no explanation.

We booked a package for the Valentine's Day which included dancing and champagne at the hotel's club. Unfortunately, the weekend was unpleasantly interrupted the morning of February 13th when an employee of the hotel used his all access room key to enter our friend's room even though they had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door and check out time was much later. The Doubletree employee walked in on them in the middle of an intimate moment and saw my best friend naked. She was appalled and mortified and both she and her husband screamed and clumsily fell off of the bed in a panic. We roomed next door and heard the commotion, but thought it was just someone goofing on off in the hallway. We were appalled when shortly thereafter our friends told us what was going on. When they called the management of the hotel (the highest ranking person in management on that day was the Housekeeping Supervisor), she reported that there were no male housekeepers, so they must be mistaken. Mistaken? Really? The male friend of the couple is a Detective in the police department, and immediately kicked into \"detective mode.\" He had to insist they contact hotel security and do an investigation to find out who entered their room. Much chaos ensued along with my friend in tears and my husband and me trying to console her. I ended up speaking with the housekeeping supervisor, who added insult to injury by misstating my friend's first name to me and when I told her she was incorrect, instead of apologizing and asking for her name, had the audacity to tell me that my friend had misspoken her OWN name. Several hours later, we finally found out that the man, which indeed WAS on Doubletree's hotel staff was a \"runner.\" He entered the room unauthorized to put water bottles in it (something that is only supposed to happen in unoccupied rooms being prepped for the next guests) and completely bypassing the Do Not Disturb, the fact that the guest list was registered to check out later that day, AND breaking many other hotel protocols. This employee of Doubletree also did NOT report the incident to his supervisor. They had to investigate the room key access for that room to find out it had been him. There were other minor things that had occurred during the stay that one can chalk up to \"hotel anomalies.\" As a frequent business traveler, I get that some minor things can happen. However, this security breach and the mishandling of the situation thereafter is absolutely inexcusable. I left a message for the Hotel's General Manager, which as of this morning has still to return my call. I will not be staying at this Hilton Hotels Doubletree property ever again.

Flying out of SeaTac, the hotel is easily recognizable from the window of the airplane because of its large campus and the tall height of its main tower. The Friday night we stayed with at the Doubletree, we drove in from out of town, ate dinner and arrived kind of late, at least after 10pm. The front desk staff actually had a bit of a line to deal with as they were checking in an off-duty air crew and there was one other guest checking in. When we finally got to the counter we found the desk clerk to be very friendly in spite of the lateness of the evening. Just after completing the paperwork, we were offered the rather famous warm Doubletree cookies. They were quite enjoyable even if we didn't have any milk to go with them. Our booking was through a low priced hotel source which does only double occupancy bookings, so we kind of assumed that we would get a single king room, however when we arrived at our room we found two queens. That is fine. The room was very large, even for a double queen room. There was a great deal of floor space, so much so that even with a work desk and two occasional chairs the room felt a little bit like a cave. The room also had a balcony. The balcony overlooked the parking lot, however that side of the parking lot was controlled by the valet, so there wasn't nearly as much noise as you would expect. The only issue we had was the cleanliness of the glasses in the room. We had to call the care line and ask them to send up clean glasses. Both glasses provided in the room looked as if they had food residue in the bottom of them. We received clean glasses about 5 minutes after we made our call. My wife and I slept well. I usually don't enjoy hotel beds, they are either too soft or too hard, or in the worse case scenario, worn out; and to be honest I'm just used to my own bed, but this night I slept particularly well.

You can easily see it and will have some nice views of arriving and departing aircraft. They have a free 24/7 airport shuttle service. The hotel buildings and grounds itself are very large and the hotel complex is an unusual shape/design which tends to add to the privacy aspect. It\u2019s comprised of one main large 11+ floor structure and six other shorter \u201cwings\u201d. The six smaller wings are laid out in a quasi-geometric design with their outdoor pool somewhat in the center. ==> Lobby / Check-in: We were picked up quickly at the hotel/car rental van pick-up areas and our bags loaded by a cheerful driver. We chatted along the way about our flight over and the local weather.. It was a :10 drive at best.. Upon arrival we got our bags back and walked into the lobby.. The first thing you\u2019ll notice about the lobby is the nice fire place with sitting chairs and the like.. It has a very pleasing \u201cNorthwest\u201d feel to it. As our rooms are pre-paid and pre-assigned, there is little front desk formality aside from room key distribution. ==> Room: My room was a basic mid-tier level in the main building and had a good view of the airport to the west. The rooms are well equipped, but not over-the-top. It was decorated in soft tones of golden yellows with some green and accented with natural woods. The room had a half-sized work desk with multi-power plugs and good direct lighting. The TV was a newer flat screen TV with traditional programming. There is also a self-service stocked coffee/tea maker and the highlight of my stay-- THE COOKIES-- to which they are somewhat famous for! Being close to the airport I was glad to see that the windows were reasonably well sound insulated. They were not totally sound proof, but even with aircraft landing nearby I could not say the sound was noticeable or distracting by any means. The drapes/window coverings aren\u2019t totally black-out, so those who are extremely light sensitive sleepers may have some issues in the post-sunrise hours. The bed: It was a traditional US queen sized and more than ample for one. They had nice sheets and pillows (extra in my closet if needed) and an ample duvet as well. ==> Bathroom: My bathroom was average sized and equipped with most common fixtures. It had a combination tub/shower which I prefer as I like to take a leisurely soak from time to time. They provide most basic toiletries as well. Everything in my room and bathroom was in proper working order and was spotlessly clean as I would hope, and expect. ==> Hotel facilities and Amenities: The hotel has an outdoor seasonal pool which is located in the \u201cmiddle\u201d of the other smaller wings. Small, but more than ample for a dip or a leisure swim.. The hotel has a decent sized work out room and the best feature\u2014an electronic indoor driving range! Naturally, being an airport hotel, they have all the classic airport-hotel features like free 24/7 airport shuttles, business center, newsstand, sundries store and the like. There are two in-house restaurants; one that serves only breakfast in the morning and a second that opens in the early afternoon and serve both lunch and dinner. Neither serves on a 24 hour basis. You can also use room service, but this too is not a 24hour service. ==> SUMMARY: This hotel gets good reviews from my flying colleagues and I see why. Their staff are always pleasant and willing to do what you ask. The hotel is well maintained and has some \u2018character\u2019 to it- you \u201cfeel\u201d like you\u2019re in the Northwest. Rooms are of ample size and well appointed- nothing over the top, nor run down either. They have all the amenities, services and facilities that you\u2019d expect from an airport-area hotel. ** PROS: Great location and easy access to/from the airport. Friendly staff. EXCELLENT cookies. There are some nearby alternate dining options that are very walkable. ** CONS: Limited in-house dining options.

The location is convenient to the airport, Mariners games, downtown Seattle, Southcenter shopping, etc. Everything is just 10-15 minutes away. The parking is a little steep $16.95 but most of the hotels in that area surcharge for parking. At the Doubletree you can park in front of your room area if you are in the 3 story buildings. This is nicer than dragging luggage all over the conference centre. The lobby has a nice restaurant, lounge/bar and coffee kiosk. The prices are reasonable and the drinks and food pretty good.

Rainier NP. It was easy to find the free hotel shuttle bus from the airport. The first few buses were full of arriving passengers (we arrived on a Thursday evening, which is busy at any major airport, so I understand). The drivers were very friendly and apologetic when a few of us couldn't get on the first two shuttles, but they were proactive in using their radios to call other drivers to give them the heads-up. But, we got to the hotel just fine, and they gave us a voucher for food/drinks anywhere in the hotel that more than made up for having to wait a few extra minutes :). We were given warm cookies at check-in, where the front desk agents were very nice and took no time to get us checked-in. I thought that they would be really backed up with all of the full shuttles dropping off passengers before us, but there were only two or three people in line when we walked up. We got upgraded to a nice balcony room on a high floor (we're HH Gold), but I can't comment on the view because we arrived after dark and it was foggy the next morning. Our room's balcony wrapped all the way around the side of the building but didn't have any chairs or tables. The room didn't have the newest decor, but the bed was very comfortable; the bathroom was nothing spectacular. I had specifically requested a room facing away from the airport tarmac and toward Mt. Rainier, so I don't know if noise would have been an issue had we stayed on the other side of the building. I don't recall any noise from neighboring rooms or jet engines the entire night. We used our voucher to order breakfast delivered to our room, so I can't comment on the breakfast in the restaurant downstairs, but the room service was on time and food was good and hot. But the restaurant did have a Starbucks station in-house (that gets lots of points with an addict like me), and tons of comfortable seating w/ fireplaces that looked welcoming even if you weren't eating at the restaurant itself. There were some public computers near the entrance to the restaurant, which I used to print our car rental reservation, and another seating area with fireplace near the lobby entrance.

Notified them I was Hilton Honours member and asked for tower room on floor 7 or above as recommended by other reviewers. Received email saying this had been noted and they would try to accommodate. On arrival their system was down so we were allocated a room in a wing (think it was 5). Receptionist very polite and said if we returned in 2hrs when system was back up they would move us. Room they moved us to, however,was only on 5th floor wit view over car park. The cups (paper not china) were used and there was a used coffee bag in the machine. The bedside light was also faulty. We reported this on our way back into the hotel after going over the road to eat. The receptionist said he would send someone up straight away which I acknowledged was great as we had been up for over 20hrs and were very tired. 1.5hrs later no-one had been and I phoned down. I received an apology and another promise of immediate action. It took a further 40mins before someone appeared and they simply provided fresh cups. It was far too late to raise the issue of the lights. Having said this the rooms were spotless, huge and the beds very comfortable with pillows to die for. Considering the hotel is opposite the airport it is not well soundproofed and you could hear the road and air traffic. We didn't eat at the hotel but went to Dave's diner for tea-nothing special but cheap and varied, typical American comfort food- and Denny's for breakfast which was again, good value. Also didn't use the gym or outdoor swimming pool but that looked clean. For convenience to the airport this hotel is fine (although it occupies a massive square footage and if you are allocated a room in one of the wings there could be a long walk) and there is a free, regular shuttle service to and from the airport itself. It is, however approx 20mins away from Seattle itself so not very convenient if you want to grab a quick sight seeing opportunity. I think that in summary it does what it says on the tin and our hiccup ignored, it does it very well and comfortably.

Third-party prices fill otherwise unsold rooms, and provide the hotel with opportunities to sell services and win future business. My advice to Priceline customers: pay attention to reviews, articulate your needs clearly (both in advance and on arrival) and speak directly and immediately to management if your expectations are not met. If basic room needs are unmet and you bought from Priceline, tell Priceline in writing; use snail mail to the company\u2019s street address and direct to Customer Service VP. I\u2019ve found them responsive. Talk to local management directly, pleasantly: they value meaningful guest feedback and often can use information you provide to correct persistent problems. Be courteous and civil to a fault: it never helps to be confrontational.] [If you are buying on Priceline an airport-area hotel of 3-stars, this will generally be what you get for $42-$55 depending on season.] BE FOREWARNED: This is a giant airport hotel, poorly-mapped, with potentially-confusing room numbering and a condition of near-permanent chaos at the front desk. A person to interact with lobby arrivals when it\u2019s busy (usually) would be a really good idea. Standing in any distant public area, you will likely see many confused and guests . . . trying to locate a room or service that may be a mile from the front desk. You are likely to stand for a long time at the long, long front desk, uncertain where to get help. [If you are disabled, help will be needed: sit down in the lobby, ask on the telephone for management or bell desk help to check in.] Dozens of room are blocked for airline personnel, who seem to check in quickly. Your room is as likely as not to be a mile or more from check-in. [Solution: Ask in advance for a room near the front desk. Ask for bell help with luggage. Ask for a property map.] COMMENDABLE: Continually running airport shuttle, will drop passengers at light rail station 06. miles north, pickup from that station on request or inside terminal during regular runs. Rail is a quick and cheap way of getting to downtown Seattle anytime 5 AM to 1 AM. Spacious rooms, good light-block via curtains. Excellent bedding, pillows, in-room coffeemaker; responsive wall temperature control. Free internet if you are an HHonors member, and becoming one is free. . . but bad download speeds. A mini-fridge will be provided on request, free if there is a medical reason for the request. Very attractive outdoor pool. Reasonably-priced soft drink vending machines ($1)--not typical of a hotel. If you can find it in Wing 5, a 2nd floor coin laundry with one washer and one dryer, $1 each. I always carry liquid detergent in my checked luggage, protected in a zip-lok bag. Free print of airline boarding pass in lobby, though not a customer-friendly kiosk or procedure. CHALLENGING: Variable (common) but usually very slow wireless internet speeds: typical was 30 K/sec = hard to web surf or do serious work. Very expensive overnight parking, self-paid or valet; typical of airport area. Long building-to-building distances, very challenging for someone with a mobility handicap and luggage.

The Doubletree Inn across from the Seattle airport was part of our cruise package so to make it easy on our large group, we booked the extra days there, too. On the last evening there, July 4, we decided to wash a load of clothes to start the trip fresh. My husband hung out with the clothes from washer to dryer while I watched our son in the pool. As the clothes were finishing up with the 2nd round in the dryer (1st time barely got them dry), he popped over to the pool to tell me he was almost done so we could start getting ready for dinner. He returned shortly thereafter and I asked if he was done already but he replied that the clothes had been stolen!!! I thought he was kidding but he had a \"Property Loss/Damage Report\" form in hand to fill out. I felt sick trying to remember what we had lost - underwear, socks, favorite t-shirts, jeans, slacks, bra, blouses - basics we had for our trip. When and where could we shop to replace these things when we were flying out early the next morning? The hotel uses key cards to get into the laundry room and there were no signs posted warning people to keep an eye on their belongings. At this upscale and very expensive hotel, we never would have imagined someone stealing our clothes. Husband submitted the report to a security officer who claimed that they would work on it and we'd be hearing from their insurance company. I wasn't satisfied with the response and went to talk with security myself and to get a copy of the report which they hadn't given us. I got a copy of the report and a $50 voucher for their restaurant for our \"troubles\" with a promise that the insurance company would be contacting us. Luckily, Anchorage, our first stop on our trip, has a huge JC Penney's store where we were able to replace most of our stolen items, although some of the shirts were irreplaceable. Fast forward 2 weeks and the end of our trip. We stayed in the motel across the street (no way would we go back to DoubleTree) and I went over to see where the case was. I explained the situation to a different security officer who at first said he knew about it but when I talked with him further didn't seem familiar with the case and tried to keep my copy of the report. He repeated that their insurance copy would be contacting us. We're home now and there has been no contact - no snail mail or voice mail from their insurance company. I don't know how long it will take or if we'll ever see any restitution but I want to warn everyone about the possibility of a thief lurking in the DoubleTree at SeaTac. Oh, and the meal voucher was questioned by our waitress that night who took over an hour to get our food. We had reservations for 6pm, didn't get served until 7:15pm, the order was messed up, the food was cold, and the whole experience was terrible!

The hotel has 24/7 complimentary airport shuttle. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Doubletree. It was so comfortable, and the rooms are very large.

We took the hotel shuttle back to the airport and rode the Light Rail into town for sightseeing. The shuttle driver dropped us off at the rail station. The light rail is $5 round trip. We got off at the pioneer village exit and caught the Gray Line double decker tour bus around the city. It goes to all of the major sight- seeing venues. We took the Light Rail back to the airport and took the hotel shuttle back to the hotel. Only drawback was that we had to walk a little ways when we got back to the airport to get to the shuttle. If we went again we would have just walked to the hotel from the rail station. It was probably closer. The food in the hotel is a little costly. We did eat there a few times, and the food was very good. There is a Denny's across the street and a Jack in the Box. We ate at both of them and the food was good there also. It is a major intersection but there is a crosswalk, and we did not have any problems. The hotel clerks were very, very helpful. There were a lot of airport personnel staying there. The hotel recommended Seattle Express to take us to and from the hotel to the pier for our cruise. I contacted them in advance and had a confirmation email for both trips. It was $12. per person each way. They also took some people to the airport from the pier. Everything was absolutely perfect. We had a great cruise and a great stay at the Doubletree.

Decent size with flat panel TV, and normal size bathroom. Had a room that faced away from the airport so that helped with the noise. Slept ok, but the room was quiet. Service was great and bell person got ice for us and was very helpful. Check out was quick. Shuttle bus goes every 18 minutes and we walked out the front door just as one was leaving. Was hoping it would stop but it kept going (empty at that). At that point we waited the 18 minutes with 10 other people and caught the next bus. Return to the hotel was fine. Bus driver called for our car but it wasn't ready when we arrived. waited a few more minutes for valet to bring car back. Be sure to have your receipt for parking from the front desk (i did thanks to previous posts) or you won't be able to get your car. All in all a good airport property.

Location proximity to airport can't be beat. Shuttle picks up opposite the terminal. Take the skybridge towards the parking garage and pick up the shuttle where all of the other hotel and parking lot buses pick up. There is a complimentary phone to call the hotel, but it is not necessary as the shuttle runs all the time. I have been told that the frequency depends on the time of day. I waited 15 minutes. Shuttle was packed with airline crew members as this seems to be the place that many crews overnight. This made check-in painfully slow. Even though there is a dedicated check-in for airline crews, they are sharing the same number of check-in clerks so the regular check-in was reduced to one staff member. Eventually a second person came to help out, but when all was done I waited over 15 minutes to check in. During the check-in process, cookies were received and I was asked if I was okay with a room that only had a shower in the bathroom. I said that this was fine. Reviews are correct when they say that the layout of the hotel is confusing. I've never been lost in a hotel, but I found it difficult to find my room and had to back track once. Once I figured out the first number of the room is the building number, things made much more sense and the signage was adequate to find the room. The room was smallish, and somewhat motel like in layout and finishes. The room, on the first floor overlooked a parking lot and another building in the background. The bathroom was a decent size and did indeed only have a shower. Again, the reviews stating that the bathroom floors are tile, unheated, and very cold are accurate. The floors in the bathroom were so cold I had to put down towels to create pathways. The shower, although a decent size, was disappointing and next time I'll be sure to ask for a tub. The hotel is beautiful from the outside. Sort of \"west coast meets Polynesia\". The inside common areas are also quite beautiful, although still undergoing a rennovation in places including the front desk area. The rooms, although updated with new furniture, flat screen, bedding, etc., the overall layout and design of the rooms seem dated, including the door itself with a huge gap on the bottom. Considering the price paid on Priceline.com, I would say that this hotel gave very good value for the price paid. I found the staff pleasant, but I really did not require their services so I can't comment on what other reviewers have said about the apathy of many of the staff. The location can't be beat, and it is true that you could actually walk from the airport depending on terminal. I just could not figure out the sidewalk route I would take and one could tell from the layout of the airport that walking is just not encouraged, but it s doable. There are many small fast food restaurants in the area, but fine dining appears to be limited. The landscaping of the hotel is beautiful, but I feel that all of Seattle is like this: lush.

Your choices were to either pay for access in your rooms or go to a \"common area\" where the wireless service was free.

It was old and so-so on the cleanliness. Access to the room was also poor. You either had to walk a mile through the hotel to get to your room or drive around to the back parking lot at which time you had to haul all your luggage up a large flight of stairs.

Nice place close to airport that provides a free shuttle. Went to check in desk and was surprised to find several people waiting to check in. Three people were working the counter, but about 9 couples were waiting to check in. I waited for my turn and was put off by hotel staff taking flight crew that arrived well after us ahead of everyone else waiting to check in. Situation got a little heated when a lady asked why they were being taken before her and a flight attendant stated (not very smart) they were tired from flying all day, had to fly out in the morning and didn't have time to waste in line. The lady answered they had been travelling all day from east coast and were tired, too. I lay responsibility for the exchange on the hotel not stepping in. The hotel does have a sign for a separate check in and should have taken them to that counter for the flight crews. I personally would rather wait a few minutes and have a rested flight crew to take me home. Also, I don't want to be involved in someone's argument at 10pm. Anyway, we checked in to a room (they give you each a hot chocolate chip cookie at check in) on the first floor of Building 5 which is a bit of a hike from check in. Put stuff in the room and went back to hotel bar. Ordered some food and drinks, watched sports highlights on big screens and went back to room. Decent food at good prices. The best was the clam chowder and Alaskan Amber Ale. Room was a comfortable king bed with a nice small patio. Room had coffee maker, big screen tv, desk and 2 chairs and a nice bathroom.

I proceeded to TripAdvisor to find out what kind of reviews this hotel was getting, and I was so disappointed! I was not looking forward to staying in this hotel for 4 days/3 nights after reading all the bad news. Upon arrival, I said to the check-in hostess, \"I know we are Priceline customers, but could we get a little better room.\" She suggested another $10 per night would get us a Tower Room (the newest of the rooms). My husband declined and so we just asked her to give us a room in which the television could be viewed from the bed. She did say that they have all types of rooms. I had read many reviews about the rooms in which the tv is located in an alcove and not viewable from the bed. I don't know why I asked this, but simply asking got us a WONDERFUL room!!!!!! I can not say enough GOOD things about our room, located in Wing 7, room #7206...very close to the lobby and parking. The room was obviously renovated recently, VERY clean, VERY large, nice decor and new furniture, and also had a balcony overlooking a green area (instead of a parking lot). The room details we loved were: the large flat screen tv, the wonderful little coffee/tea maker and the \"to go\" cups/lids supplied, the full bathroom AND a second, separate sink outside of the main bathroom (Great for couples getting ready at the same time!), the newer, plush, and very large towels, the tasteful decor, the very comfortable bed with down comforter and pillows, wonderful desk area, ergonomic chair and separate seating area, and the DELICIOUS warm cookies upon check-in. About the cookies: On the second night of our stay, we were craving some more of those delicious cookies, so we asked a worker walking by the front desk if she knew where we could purchase some in the hotel. She replied, \"There's some in a tin in the gift shop, but if you just ask the front desk, they'll probably give you some more...ah, there's a line there...I'll just go get you some.\" Now, THAT'S customer service above and beyond the call of duty! :-) About the staff: The check in was seamless and fast and friendly \"enough\", the maid service was QUICK, friendly, and provided us with MORE towels than we originally asked for (above and beyond the call of duty), the gift shop worker was very nice and funny, and the wondering worker who gave us extra cookies was great! Not one bad experience with the staff! Keep up the good work, Doubletree! I can't say enough good things about our stay at the Doubletree and hope other Priceline bidders have as nice a stay as we did. With all that said, I DO have issue with this hotel and hotels that charge their guests a parking fee (here it was $17 and change)...especially in a large area such as around the Seattle Airport. I can understand a parking charge in a city such as San Francisco where real estate is at a premium...but near SeaTac Airport??? That's like Albertson's Grocery Store charging you parking to come shop at their market. I just don't think it's good business. Nevertheless, I'd stay here again and just factor in the extra cost of parking...as long as I can get a great hotel rate.

This hotel is very convenient and comfortable, being located close to the airport and with large and comfortable rooms. The hotel is huge, with many wings, so if you have lots of luggage ask for a room close to the lobby as others have pointed out. Their free shuttle service is somewhat confusing and needs improvement. Follow the signs to ground transportation/airport shuttles. There are very many shuttles so you have to read the signs where to stand for Hilton/Doubletree. The first shuttle wouldn't let me on, said I had to make a reservation but when I called the hotel they said no rez necessary! The second one was 20 minutes later. I was extremely lucky to be the last person on, hence first off as there was only one receptionist and about 8 people were lined up behind me for check-in. Room I booked my room as a reward stay and it was a big king, w/balcony, desk, big tv, big bathroom with extra vanity area outside, nice Neutrogena products, air-conditioning (it occasionally warms up in Seattle). Bed comfort is very subjective; I found this bed comfy and firm enough. The room was clean, no complaints here. But: it was on the ground floor and I question the security at this hotel. I was right next to an exit and there are so many wings and so many exits I am sure people get in and out all the time. Not good. Keep your door and balcony bolted. Restaurants I had a very pleasant small evening meal (a cup of clam chowder, a delicious pecan and goat cheese salad and glass of wine) for a reasonable price. As other reviewers point out, there are plenty of options in the area. I also breakfasted at the hotel, a reasonable $12 for a continental buffet. The warm buffet costs more; you can also order from the menu. Most airport-hotel restaurants charge an arm & leg so thumbs up to Doubletree for these tasty, affordable options for dinner and breakfast. Facilities. Free internet in public areas (wireless for a charge in the rooms), computers for printing boarding passes; gift shop; guest laundry coin-operated--a nice feature though there is nowhere to make change unless you purchase something (the front desk would't make change)! There is a nice outdoor pool area, I didn't try it but it looked to be a favorite spot for guests. I didn't try room service, though there were dirty dishes left in the halls (not good, Doubletree). Check-out I used the express check-out option and returned to the airport on the free shuttle (it is customary to tip the driver who will lift your luggage on and off); again, if you are using the shuttle you will need to be patient and also calculate plenty of time as they apparently run only every 20-30 minutes and are crowded. I didn't try the parking so no comment. I suppose you can also take a taxi; it's less than a mile to Seatac. Oh: I think you can catch a Seattle public bus right on the street for real cheap so that's definitely an option if you don't have piles of luggage. This public bus will also pick you up at the Terminal at arrivals. It is a super option if you are traveling to downtown, only about $2.00 (I have used it lots in the past), and I think it stops near this hotel too. Conclusion: If you can get a good rate this is absolutely a great place to stay for a layover if you don't have time to stay somewhere downtown and visit the beautiful city of Seattle (if you have a few hours take the public bus, stops near Pike Place Market etc). p.s.

I am not someone who only points out the negatives in life~so if I sound mostly negative here, I'm sorry, but this is what stood out to me! I did mention the positives here,too. The experience I had with my arrival was not so good. My sister dropped myself, my husband and our child off at the hotel so we could catch an early flight the next day. She literally parked, walked us to check in,went to our room (so her little girl could use the restroom) and left.....15 minutes she was there, they rudely said that she was there for 23 minutes, and only the first 20 minutes are free, then made her pay $4.00 ~credit card only, she was lucky she had one. The hotel goes for at LEAST $199 + tax per night, and they charge her $4 to drop us off? I think that is pretty outrageous. (I read other reviewers on priceline say it's about $17/night for guests to park overnight too!! Parking should be included in the $200 a night.) When we checked in the woman who was working the desk was unfriendly, and seemed put out that she had to check us in. The man in the lobby who offered to help us with our bags was so nice. He made a joke with us, and was welcoming in general. The room itself was great! It's huge, which is helpful when you have a four year old boy with you! There was PLENTY of room for the three of us to relax in there. We also loved that there was a nice balcony and big windows.

When we lifted the toilet seat for my son to use the toilet there were large chunks and splashes of VOMIT all over the toilet.

There is another downtown Doubletree shuttle so make sure you are on the correct shuttle! Only a short 8 minute ride put us at the hotel check in for a signature warm cookie and friendly service. I was originally assigned a ground room floor in a remote building but requested a 3rd floor/top floor room instead, preferably overlooking the onsite pond. Without a blink from the desk clerk, I got my third floor...only later did I understand it was in the tall tower staring at scaffolding that was part of the exterior stucco project occuring this April and May. I had a view of two busy streets, a parking lot and the large Northwest Airlines maintenance hangar each morning. Despite not being informed of this construction on checkin or during my reservation, the workers were of no consequence and I never heard them. I just had to keep a south window curtain pulled since the scaffolding was right....there. I was here for an intense work session anyhow and it wasn't noisy beyond what I expected for an airport hotel so I bit the bullet and kept the room. I'll get the 3rd floor pond view on another visit. I'm sure I could've pushed but just needed to get settled and get busy. The building layout here is rather adventurous so take care to consider how far you want to be from certain features and/or activities. If you do want a view, the upper floors of the tower offer westward views across SeaTac and the Elliot Bay area. Despite the ages of the buildings, the lower structures all have a very contemporary northwest feeling to them with exposed beams and rich details throughout the complex. I found this to be very welcoming and comfortable. Keep in mind the views are limited if any from this complex. The tower room had a corner wrap around deck but no exterior chairs to enjoy the crisp humid air. I did have a chair out for a few evening hours to enjoy the air. Since the deck above partially covered mine, it was like a room extension and the wraparound deck was enormous. Without scaffolding and workers there I'm sure it is downright enjoyable. The room itself was large with a mixture of maple and cherry woods with contemporary shapes and accents. Upon entering the room, to the left is a full sink and closet, with the bath, toilet and another full sink further left and separated by a door. They have the nice touch of a full length mirror on this door, whcih seems to be a rarity for hotels I been in recently. The closet was generous and had plenty of hangars, an iron and ironing board. A few steps further into the room and it oepned up to the bed, a long couch, end table, coffee table, occassional chair, a full size desk and even an adjustable task chair for the desk area. The king size bed was comfortable and had 6 comfortable feather pillows. The bedside table had a phone along with the standard Hilton multi-function alarm clock. Doubletree offers a Wolfgang Puck branded coffee and tea with a special maker for you to use (but you'll have to unplug your computer to do it). The adjacent desk area was comfortable and easy to work on. My only complaint was the single outlet space on the desk shared by the coffee maker. If you have more than three items to charge or want coffee, you'll have to go looking high and low. HVAC was electronically controlled and was easily and quickly adjusted. It was a return air system and was only a low hum. Ther return air register above the stand alone sink was furrier than a pet shop and definately needed a good vacuum and wipe down. Each room is equipped with pay by the day or pay by the hour ethernet internet and I had no problems connecting for service. If you want to save the time or only need it for a short period, the lobby area has reliable wifi for free. I only hooked up one day of my stay and the others I used the lobby wifi for data transfers. Using a webservice you can print directly to the front desk and it will be delivered or you can pick it up. This was a huge time saver and no charge for the service. It works from both the pay accounts and the free wifi. Decor was toward the tans, oranges, and browns in the room, and that kept a nice feeling depite the typical semi sunny and rainy weather during the stay. The room carpet was well kept with only a few stains near the coffee maker. The bathroom was roomy and clean. I still find it hard to overlook the extensive grout mold that seems to crop up at all price points only because it is not a hard fix, it just takes someone using the right material in a proper install. The complimentary nutragena bath condiments were welcome as I like that they are non-allergenic and don't leave a scent of any sort. The best part of the bathroom was the lack of noise from any other resident or function around you. The room was overall a fairly quiet place but keep in mind you are across from a busy airport and a stones throw from one of the bsuiest intersections in the region. You will hear noise and some of it will be loud enough to notice. The features of the hotel are pretty good. The lobby restaurant is pretty good for all meals and the bar/grill could use better service but didn't get so bad as to not be able to recommend it. There is a little coffee and danish spot as well as a full service sundries shop, just be ready to pay airport prices for your purchases. The bright spots are the well appointed health clubs that serve the tower and complex. Among the nicest I've seen in the past few years. The tower room looking west was too low to see anything but high enough not to be insulated from the road and airport noise. I'd go as as high up as possible in the tower to have the view or as far to the northeast as possible to get a room on the pond and some quiet. Everything in between will still have something in proximity - you'd do well to look at the hotel layout and talk it over with the reservation or desk clerk to get the room you really want. I\"ll be back, but on that 3rd or 4th floor overlooking the pond next time.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, CA", "Title": "\u201cBest Airport Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Klockars", "ReviewID": "UR12378046", "Content": "This is the best airport hotel we have stayed in, and we have stayed there twice.

Anyway, Tripadvisor saved us the overnight parking fee, since we read about it in advance and made arrangements to turn in our rental car one day early, then take the shuttle back to the hotel. The shuttle was very convenient and on-time. We stayed on the 5th floor in the tower, and had secured a really affordable (payment in advance) rate online. We found our room very clean, and had everything we needed. The crib (a packnplay) we requested was delivered promptly too. Since we didn't want to leave the hotel with our 2 year old (it was really cold and rainy) we ate in the hotel lounge. Since we had her with us, they sat us out to the side of the actual lounge. We ordered three appetizers and a dessert, and all were excellent and beautifully served. We enjoyed our evening at this hotel, and we ran our daughter around the lobby a lot, and I also used one of the treadmills in the fitness rooms. Overall, we would give our stay a 10 plus, and will certainly use this hotel again before our yearly overnight out of Seattle when visiting my husband's family!

In-room internet is not free, though you can go to the lobby area with your laptop and connect wirelessly there (for free). In-room you have to connect with a cable and you pay daily for that.

I decided to park on nearby S 192nd Street and walk the long block; I just don't like being taken advantage of. Local calls are $1.25, though 800 # calls are free.

And, no doubt the price was better than if we had booked it elsewhere. However there were lots of issues. Let's start with the worst: the nice white throwpillows that Doubletree puts on each bed proclaiming the joys of a comfy night's sleep were covered with someone else's hair. Lots and lots of it. Bad enough that this was the case but these same pillows were resting on our bed pillows. Really gross and very unhealthy to boot. Our ground floor room was by chance for handicapped use. The architect must have been drunk since in order to reach the bath towels from the tub you had to clim,b out of the tub and walk across the bathroom. No place to hang a towel near the tub. Now, back to the pillows: the bed pillows were the composition of oatmeal.....mushy mushy mushy. I couldn't sleep and I believe that's the reason I was there in the first place. On our second night the used soaps were left for us and the shampoo and conditioner were not replaced. The conditioner, btw, at all Doubletree Hotels is virtually impossible to get out of the container so it's pretty useless. I would describe the hotel employees as polite and incompetent. We asked for replacement shampoo and it never came. Day two our newspaper didn't show up either. A loud humming noise in our room warranted two friendly but unhelpful visits from maintenance and the gentleman tried his best but eventually shrugged his shoulders and the humming noise continued for the duration. His equipment, btw, was substituting a wastecan for a ladder. He turned it over and stood on it. One other note, this hotel charges for inroom internet (which we never got to work anyway and wound up using the lobby's which was an enormous!!!!! walk from our room...the place is huge!!!) and $16/night for parking whereas every other place in the area provides free parking.

The hotel is basically across the street from the airport, so you do hear the planes, but that wasn't really bothersome for me. The guestrooms are being or have been renovated, and while I was there, they were renovating the lobby, so most parts of the hotel feel very fresh and new. I booked through Doubletree's website, and was offered an option to upgrade to a premium suite for $30/night if one was available at check-in. Upon check-in, sure enough a suite was available, and I was given a room on the Penthouse floor -- much to my surprise. The room was fantastic! As you would expect from a suite, it had the bedroom separate from the sitting area, but the room was huge! In the living room area, there was a small dining table, a leather couch, upholstered easy chair with ottoman, and work desk/chair. Also a small bar area, TV, and stereo w/ DVD player. The bedroom was also nice, with the Doubletree \"Sweet Dreams\" bed, clock/radio w/ MP3 input, and another TV. The bathroom was probably as large as the bedroom, with a 2-sink vanity, large soaking tub, and HUGE shower. And that shower -- wow! It had the most water pressure of any shower I've ever seen... if I could figure out how to get my shower at home to do that, I wouldn't think twice! Floor-to-ceiling windows looked onto the balcony which extended the entire width of the room. The views of the mountains and sunset (and yes, the airport) were very nice. As for the rest of the hotel, it is comprised of the 14-story tower (where my room was) and several 3-story \"wing\" buildings. If you were staying in one of the farther out wings, it could be a bit of a hike from the lobby, but the parking lot surrounds the hotel, so at least you'd be able to park close and come/go through one of the card-access-only doors. The elevators for the tower rooms are also a bit of a walk from the lobby (through the meeting room area), which seemed like a strange design. Two fitness centers are available: one just inside the wing nearest the tower building, and the other between two of the wing buildings overlooking the pool. The outdoor pool is situated in a courtyard area between some of the wings, and looked very nice. The hotel has a lobby area coffee bar, rooftop restaurant, and mid-range lobby restaurant. I ate at the lobby restaurant one night -- nothing spectacular, just average. Free wi-fi is available in the lobby, as well as free kiosks near the coffee shop if you don't have your computer. Wired Internet access is available in-room for a fee. Parking is a bit steep (at $14/day if I remember correctly), and is also used by people parking for the airport. It is controlled entry, but just know that it's not reserved only for hotel guests. The staff was polite and professional. When I checked out, the rate I was billed was higher than what it should have been (the regular room + $30 upgrade), but the front desk clerk quickly adjusted the rate to what I had confirmed on the website. She did mention that I shouldn't have gotten the room I did for that rate, but followed that with \"but that's our mistake, not yours.\" I know some hotels who would have insisted I pay the higher rate, so I appreciate her doing the right thing for the customer.

My friend and I always judge a hotel by a number of factors and the Doubletree scored well for water pressure, room space, temp control (how well the AC works), beds & bonus points for a warm cookie on check in! The only issue I really had was that our room was sooooooo far away. We got in at midnight from our flight and then had to drag our luggage (well technically the bell hop did most of the dragging but still) the very last room in the very last building. That aside, everything else was more that sufficient. Oh yeah, we also didn't like the fact that for $1 the vending machine gave you a teeny tiny dasani!

A $35 bid for a 3-star room in the Sea-Tac hotel zone will often get you into the Doubletree. By the time Priceline adds on taxes and fees, the cost goes up to $47. Because of my flight schedules, I merely use the Doubletree for sleeping. I arrive at night and then catch an early flight the next morning. Therefore I can't comment on the hotel's public amenities; I never use them. This Hilton-managed, chain hotel is almost certainly the largest in Sea-Tac. It has hundreds of rooms, some of which can be quite a hike from the lobby. Be aware of that if you have a lot of luggage. Once you get to your room, however, it will probably be reasonably clean and reasonably quiet (except when school groups or conventioneers have filled the place). The matresses are reasonably comfortable and the linens are of reasonable quality. The free shuttles to and from the airport operate with reasonable efficiency. The warm cookie the desk clerk gives you at check-in is a nice touch. Nevertheless, there is nothng remarkable about this hotel. It could be on any airport strip in any mid-size city in North America. Across the street from the Doubletree is one of the locally-owned \"Roasters\" bar and grill restaurants. It is a good place for a beer (lots of drafts on tap) and some roast chicken or a burger and fries. For more upscale dining, check out the 13 Coins. That restaurant is on the same side of the street as the Doubletree and about two blocks north. The food there is good, but a dinner for two will probably cost you more than the room at the Doubletree.", "Date": "April 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lansing, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value & Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3339832", "Content": "The first time I booked here, I was very impressed with the property.

We were in a great suite in the tower. Our suite was very large, with two bathrooms, one with a big jacuzzi tub, plenty big enough for two, and one off the bedroom area. When you walked in the door to your right was a wetbar and a large kitchen sort of area, keep walking and you come to a dining table for about 4 people. Next you come to a living room with a sleeper sofa, coffee table and chair, a television in an armoire and next to that a desk and chair. There was a seperate sleeping area with its own TV armoire and chair. The suite was on the corner of the building with a view of the planes taking off from the bedroom and a view of a lake and the elevators from the living/dining room. The whole suite had no outside walls, just windows and a wrap around, good sized balcony. We were very satisified with the suite, and the service we received. The cookies upon check-in were a very nice treat. At only $150.00 or so we found it to be an excellent deal, and the clerk at the front desk waived the parking charge for us when we inquired about it.

The room did not have a refrigerator or microwave; the high speed internet connection in the room cost about $10. There is no complimentary breakfast; there is a coffee shop and an espresso bar that also sells yogurt, bagels and pastries. The hotel has a complimentary airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. I was attending a large conference held at the hotel. My co-workers with wing rooms said they were 'okay' and they heard some noise from neighboring rooms. The wing hallways had a damp smell. One wing building was closed for renovation. All staff were very courteous and helpful. For me the location worked well since I was attending events at the hotel and didn't have to rent a car to get there.
