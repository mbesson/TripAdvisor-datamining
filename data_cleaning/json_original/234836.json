It was just such a pleasure to be able to walk into the hotel, through the lobby and up to our room in a matter of minutes as opposed to walking through a noisy casino, although I know that is why alot of people go to Las Vegas. The pool area was clean and tidy and easily accessible. The rooms were great. We had a one bedroom suite with a kitchen and washer and dryer. The room was clean and the bathroom was nice and big. It is definitely off the main drag but we had a rental car so it wasn't a problem getting around. There is a little coffee shop and mini grocery downstairs where you can get food. We bought coffee and bagels and brought them up to the room where we could eat at our leisure. It was a nice change from having to eat at a busy hotel dining room.

It is so nice to have a refrigerator, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker in the room. The room was nice and large, I didn't feel like I was staying in a box. The room also had a blu-ray player. They also offer free wi-fi which is a plus. The deli and market have a great selection of drinks, snacks, alcohol, and other items. The deli offers sandwiches for breakfast, and lunch. Also a nice selection of pastries. If you don't mind a bit of a walk, there is an AM/PM down the street. The pool and grounds are very nice. There are two lounges to hang out. There is an active lounge with ping-pong, pool, and a large screen TV. There is also a quiet lounge if you want some peace and quiet to read or just relax.

There are also a couple of gas grills in the pool area to grill on. My total food cost for the week was just over $100.00 because I like to cook, but the restaurants and casino at the LVH property are less than a three minute walk if you are in the mood for more activity, unlike the Vacation Club on Las Vegas Blvd which is somewhat isolated.

Pool is nice, shady till about 9:30 or 10:00 then full sun till about 4:30 or 5:00 then sun is behind buildings. Maids did a really good job -- tip them well -- every single day. We never had the same maid. Bless their hearts for cleaning up after us and being exposes to the chemicals and the labor. They are in the process of remodeling their rooms - very nice. They notified us at check in that the workers will work from 9a-5p every day and they did, lots of banging if you are in the room you can hear this. One day I heard it for a couple hours while getting ready. But ended right on time. They do say they keep the floor directly above and below empty but construction noise travels. This is right next to Hilton which is connected to the Convention Center -- many people stayed at that hotel as part of the convention and said it was a dump. This is SO WORTH the 5 minute walk. Easy, easy, easy. Monorail is easy to use - we used it once to get to Harrah's for their Oyster Bar. GREAT but a lil spendy at $25 a dozen.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom unit which is actually a 1 bedroom with a lock out studio. For years the HGVC at the Las Vegas Hilton has always received the better reviews of the the other two. ( one on the north strip and the one at the Flamingo) This was our first visit to this property. We stayed about 5 years ago at the Flamingo HGVC. I must say, the Flamingo property is a bit nicer. I have no information about the newest one on the North end of the strip. We exchanged our timeshare and were notified one week before our travel of CONSTRUCTION. I completely understand that this must happen at every resort but i wish they would have notified us before we booked the resort. Thank goodness we were early risers because you could hear the jack hammering from 9am to at least 4pm every day. They also gave us a nice sheet of paper at check in advising us that there would be no water in the room from 10-3 on wednesday. In vegas that probably would not be a bad thing in the middle of the day but it was just another thing that frustrated me. The rooms are nice but again in need of an upgrade. I believe they have 17 floors and they have started the renovation and are only on the 16th. They started at the top. We were on the 7th floor and we could hear the noise very clearly. ( I feel sorry for the people that were higher than us) It was nice to get away from all that smoke. The Las Vegas Hilton is a short walk away and so is the Monorail. The Las Vegas Hilton is a bit outdated but they appear to be renovating it as well. We rented a car so we were in and out and had no issues with transportation. The deli and store there is small but nice and semi reasonable. The pool is cute but i was actually surprised how small it was. I cant imagine it being sufficient in the summer with the resort being full. They have two different lounges with a pool table and ping pong area. They have a computer in the other lounge. The gym was pretty good. We had a good time and i am glad they are updating the resort. I dont think i would return to this spot for awhile. The staff was friendly and no complaints about that.

Check-in was easy and the lobby is just excellent and clean. After checking in, our family approached the elevator and found that an inconsiderate person put out his cigarette butt in the elevator but other than that, my pregnant wife and my 9 year old son never ran into an incident where they smelled smoke. The resort staff quickly addressed the problem. Concierge was rude. We asked her questions about various shows and wanted to compare pricing between different seats. Our whole conversation did not even go on for 5 minutes and she just asked if she could help the person in line without even completing our conversation. I decided to order tickets through the Monte Carlo website instead of through her. Once we arrived in our 1 bedroom suite, we unpacked and went grocery shopping. It only cost our family approximately $60.00 to shop for all of us. That food provided breakfast, lunch, and late night snacks. We chose to shop at the nearby Smith's. When we got back we put all the food in the full-size fridge and found that the kitchen is already equipped with plates, eating utensils, pots & pans, dishwashing liquid, dishwashing scrubber, you name it. I cooked breakfast and lunch in the kitchen everyday for the family. Using the grill near the poolside is easy. Just go to the Deli to check out the BBQ utensils which include tongs, spatula, and grill scrubber. I grilled BBQ ribs and corn for the family. We later played ping pong in the recreational area. I wanted to use the pool table but my son was getting sleepy. The swimming pool is heated and has 2 Jacuzzis. Bathroom had 2 sinks so my wife and I were able to both brush our teeth, etc... at the same time. Overall, this stay was excellent.

The reception area is rather small - but no smoke filled noisy long hallways, thankfully. They also have a separate spacious lobby/business room, recreation room, a deli and a pool/jacuzzi outside. As for the service, the staff were generally friendly and accommodating. Check in and check out was an easy process too. When we summoned housekeeping, someone arrived promptly with some extra toiletries; they even allowed us to check out late, around noon. As others mentioned, the hotel is not in the busiest part of the Strip where the major hotels are located, but you can easily use the monorail to get around; or just walk across to the nearby Hilton Hotel if you want more dining and entertainment options. Overall, this is a great property for those looking for spacious rooms with a relaxed and quiet atmosphere at a great value.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "daplushman", "ReviewID": "UR68426578", "Content": "This was a wonderful hotel.

Exercise room was good, scale, and filtered water was provided. Deli was small but good in a pinch, we walked across the street to a mini-mart, beer was much cheaper than at the deli. The monorail was an 8 minute walk through the Hilton next door. Most of the week we used the Monorail, clean convenient and runs every 6 minutes. You can also pick up the Ace Bus which is an 8 minute walk in front of the Monorail at the Sahara going Southbound. You can pick up both the Ace and Deuce Bus on the strip in front of the Sahara going Northbound and Southbound. This is a little farther, closer to a 10-12 minute walk through the casino. The Ace is an express and the Deuce is a local. We went to many Wolfgang Puck Restaurants. Spago @ Caesars, Lupo @ Mandolay Bay, Postrio @ Venitian, Bar and Grill @ MGM. All top notch- I loved them all. We also went to Timpano Tavern in the Venetian, very good, but not as good as Wolfgang.

Therefore, read reviews carefully to make an informed decision and be sure the review matches the correct property. This is a \u2018resort-type\u2019 property and not a typical Las Vegas hotel. There is no casino and no buffet or fine dining restaurants directly on the premises. With that said, you can take the 5-minute walk over to the Las Vegas Hilton hotel which has a large casino and multiple fine-dining options as well as a nice buffet and plenty of fast-food restaurants. The only dining option on the HGVC site is a deli which sells cold/hot sandwiches, snacks, Starbucks coffee, salads, fruit, microwave frozen food, supplies, etc. (It is not open late, so plan ahead if you like to snack late at night!) My husband and I enjoyed the relaxed and quiet atmosphere of HGVC. After a long day/night on the Strip, it was wonderful to come back to a property that wasn\u2019t crowded with people shopping, gambling or eating. If you want to be constantly in the action and crowds, this may not be the best property for you; however, if you want to RELAX when you get back to your room, consider this property. HGVC is not directly on the Strip, nor is it within \u2018walking distance\u2019. The Monorail is an inexpensive way to avoid traffic and there is a Monorail stop across the street at the Las Vegas Hilton. Be informed and study the Monorail map. It doesn\u2019t stop directly at all attractions and hotels. Many destinations are far from Monorail stops \u2013 it all depends on where you want to go, some hotels/attractions are close to the stops. If you can, rent a car when in Vegas. Parking is abundant and free. The Strip is pretty congested, but you can drive directly to the hotels/casinos/attractions. It is also useful if you want to explore the surrounding areas. (Which I strongly suggest you do!) There is a nice pool area, but it seemed a bit small and was always crowded. Desk workers and hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed in a nice one-bedroom suite. Some other reviewers complained of \u2018thin walls\u2019 and of hearing voices from adjacent rooms. We did not have this problem \u2013 we heard them open/shut their door, but that is all. The kitchen was nicely stocked with dishes and utensils. The appliances were nice. The bedroom, bedding and mattress were all comfortable. (Pillows were a bit stiff) OK\u2026 now to my only true complaint\u2026 we were constantly asked to participate in a time-share presentation. They called our room a few times plus asked us about it every time we passed the desk upon entering/leaving. I didn\u2019t feel \u201cpressured\u201d and it was all done in a nice, friendly way\u2026 but it did get VERY annoying in that they didn\u2019t easily take \u201cno\u2019\u201d for an answer.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Maybe Needs Some Updating\u201d", "Author": "Traveller_From_CA", "ReviewID": "UR65184248", "Content": "Stayed in a one bedroom suite with a buddy for the weekend.

It just feels more relaxed. The Hilton and Sahara casinos are walking distance. The location is great, halfway between the airport and downtown and close to everything on the Strip. Best of all, this hotel is off the Strip (but very close) so that you can avoid all of the traffic. The main bed was comfortable and the bathroom was large. The double sink was nice to have. The sofa bed was your typical uncomfortable lumpy mess. I put the mattress on the floor and slept better. They have a nice small pool that was never crowded. We had a couple of margaritas one afternoon out there after returning from Red Rock Canyon, good drinks and relaxing. There was also a ping pong table and pool table in the lobby available for use. Overall a good value and I would recommend staying here. There was no high intensity sales pitch for buying into the vacation club. It is not as nice as The Signature at MGM, but it is also alot cheaper. The only problem area I would report is that sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room can be noisy.

I read many reviews prior to booking though i must admit i take complaints with a grain or two of salt as i feel many guests are impossible to please. I do stand corrected, as this hotel does have a few potential deal breakers depending on the type of person you are. For us, we loved it and would absolutely go back and so on that note i will begin the actual review The room was comfortable, a king bed and pull out sofa. TV and DVD player (plays Divx) which came in handy for me. Medium sized refrigerator provided more than enough room for all our drinks and food. While the decor might have been a bit dated, the room for me is mostly about the bed and the bed was great. I will second the complaint posted by one reviewer about the super thin walls and hearing noises from adjacent rooms, however i will add that this hotel is very laid back and most guests are not the hardcore partying type so this really was never an issue for us. The only other complaint here was by the lady and it was the lack of a full length mirror anywhere in the room The bathroom was decent however there is a major major problem here!!! The bathtub did not drain. I would turn the water off during my shower to lather and upon turning i back on to rinse it would still back up over an inch. This was the big concerns for us and we did our best to overlook it and focus on the other positives. Which would be the pool area :) yes it\u2019s not huge, but there were hardly any people there and always an abundance of chairs even on the 4th of July. The setting is nice with lots of sun and shade available if needed. The lounge chairs are amazingly comfortable and would likely be the number 1 benefit for us as we did a lot of sun bathing. I second the comments on the courteous and attentive staff and this was noticed the most around the pool area. Whether the servers would be bringing out free watermelon or Popsicle's or even the security guard coming around to each guest and asking them if everything was ok was really a nice touch. Also the 2 gas bbq's available for guests came in very handy and we wish we would have used them more. This property is a timeshare and they do try and get you to attend a presentation with the lure of a $100 free gift. They were persistent but not pushy and politely backed off when it was appropriate. I would not let this hinder you unless you can't say no to salespeople :) Other nice touches were the lounge area in the hotel, pool room, free wireless internet, decent looking fitness room (i didn\u2019t use it) and i really liked the ice water at the front that had cucumbers soaking infusing it with flavour. Regarding the location, i cannot believe people complained. Walking to Hilton took less time than it would leaving a large hotel room and walking to the strip. the monorail is right there too if you want it however we preferred to ride the deuce which was a great deal. This hotel is on the far north end of the strip, however it is only a short walk to las vegas blvd. We did order some fruit and salads from the deli which were reasonably priced and convenient. There is a grocery store about 15-20 minutes away (walking fast) which you would be doing anyhow as you are walking through a shady part of town. I cannot comment on the poolside food or drinks as we did not order any of them. Lastly, there were minor issues with the chambermaids, not refilling some of our amenities and also with small items (ie paper and a qtip) being left in the hallway for several days and not being picked up If you are looking for action, this is not the right place however if you want to be close to the action at a quiet and relaxing non gaming hotel than this is great. I have stayed at the HGVC on the strip and it is for sure a nicer and more modern property and I think next time I would pay the extra money and stay there. This is not a glamorous property so if you are looking for total luxury this might not be the place for you. However for the price the HGVC at the LV Hilton is no slouch of a hotel PS - i would have given the hotel 3.5 stars but this is not an option available", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rocky Mountains", "Title": "\u201cThis is no Hilton, and not grand either.\u201d", "Author": "flying_about", "ReviewID": "UR32717999", "Content": "I am right now in a room in this hotel, and can hear every word from the next room, it is tremendously annoying.

At check in, the desk staff was more than helpful and very pleasant. As a Diamond member, I was given 2 coupons (total value of $20) to use at the deli for breakfast each AM. Since I was staying 4 nights I asked why only 2 coupons and asked if I should have one one for each AM since this is the way all other Hiltons operate. I was told that I could use the coupons like cash and not have to spend the entire value of the coupon each day. Seemed plausible. After check in - the stay started going down hill and fast. Took 5 different keys to first enter the room - when I went back to the desk to get new keys I was told that the lock needed to be fixed and they would send someone that night. NEVER HAPPENED - each time I tried to get in my room, it took another trip to the front desk to pick up keys in the hope one would work. Each time, I got news keys - at least 3 times per day - I asked the lock by fixed. Discovered the room had no working safe - let the front desk know. Front desk assured me it would be fixed the first night - NEVER HAPPENED. Let them know the seond day the safe and the locs still had not been fixed - they assured me they would take care of it ASAP - nope... Went the deli the first AM to use my coupon to get brekfast, bought about 6 dollars worth of items and was told that I had to use the full value of the coupon or lose the rest of the value. I explained what the front desk had told me and they said I was wrong. Went to the front desk and explained what the deli person had told me and they said the deli person was wrong. I asked that the front desk person come to the deli and explain and was told they could not leave the desk - there were 4 folks working and no one was in the lobby. I gave up up on this one and went to Starbucks. The third day, I once again asked that the lock be fixed, the safe be fixed and the room be refreshed since the housekeeping had not been in the room since I checked in. Was told they would take care of it ASAP. When I went up to the room later that day and the keys did not work, the sfae had not been fixed and no visit by housekeeping had been done, I packed and got out of there.

Having the monorail station there was great and it is truly the best way to get around Las Vegas - especially since the Hilton is so far from the strip.

You don't really get any discount or advantage at the Hilton itself but if you want a nearby casino the Hilton has one. The Hilton (hotel) spa is nice; the gym is pretty small (several treadmills and steppers and several weight machines but relatively spartan by Vegas standards. Overall the Hilton Grand Vacations Club is fine if you want a quiet place to stay but it's not anywhere near a \"Vegas\" experience. One significant downside is that it's hard to get a cab here at night. During the day they call a cab for you and one usually comes. At night you are just out of luck (even if you call a cab, they don't come). It's 2 blocks from the strip and far enough away that you just can't flag one either.

When you stay at a casino hotel, it can get on your nerves...the long walk to and from your room, walking thru a smoky casino, very few amenities in your room, etc. I wanted a change and the Grand Vacations Club was perfect. We booked a king-size suite. The kitchen was perfect, even a dishwasher! There was a small washer-dryer unit in the closet. The kitchen had everything we needed to make small meals and breakfast and the fridge was full-sized. Our son slept on the sofa bed in the front room and we slept in the bedroom. The bath included a large jacuzzi tub. The room was extremely quiet - so much nicer than having to deal with the partying that happens when you sleep \"on the strip\". The pool and jacuzzi were clean and heated and nobody was around when we used them. It was wonderful! The MGM closes down their pool during the winter months as do many of the Strip hotels. There was a small grocery in the hotel, but I drove a few blocks to a market and stocked up on food. The new monorail is within walking distance of the hotel, in the back of the parking lot...an easy way to get to any of the strip casinos. The hotel also had a concierge in the lobby. She was awesome. She got us great seats for Spamalot, even though it was very short notice. All of the staff was extremely kind, helpful, and accommodating. I can't say enough nice things about them. Many of the hotels on the strip have shabby rooms and are extremely dirty...this is because many of the visitors are partying and are rough on the rooms. At this hotel, everything was in good order, clean, and beautiful. There also was a lounge with a big-screen TV and a billiards table. Lots of room to play games, if you wanted. I saw many families hanging out there during the day, but it was never crowded or annoyingly loud. Our room even came with a DVD player so our son could watch movies. This is one of the few hotels where we have stayed with that amenity. I also work on the road, so I was able to access the wireless internet from my room on my laptop with no problem. The internet service is FREE - included in the room charge...the casino hotels charge extra for that. Other than the small market and your room, there is no place to eat at the hotel...however, you can walk to the Hilton which is right next door or eat on the strip. We ate most of our meals on the strip while we visited the various attractions, but it was nice to be able to eat breakfast in our room and also have snacks when we got back in the evening. Even better, the price was less than half what the casino hotels charge...let's see: better service, more amenities, cleaner rooms, and a better price (about $100/nite vs. $250/nite)...sounds like a no brainer to me.

Although there is condo construction across Paradise Road, there was no noise pollution. Traveling eastward along Karen, I found at the next main street - Maryland Parkway - two 24 hour supermarkets - Albertsons and Vons(Safeway). The Vons, even, had a gas station, where I filled up twice for $3.01 a gallon! :) I had problems with a dead battery in the in-room safe and a backed up toilet. Both problems were fixed quickly. Each bedroom and the living room had separate heating/air conditioning system, which was a nice touch. The hotel tower shades the pool area in the morning, making an early morning swim more a polar bear experience! Patio area heaters would have made the area more useable. It turned out to be a very long walk between the HGV hotel through the LV Hilton to the LV convention center, particularly on a cold, rainy day. I ended driving most of the time - hehe. Check out was also quick with no lines. The quiet, non smoking aspects of HGV was a nice retreat from the noise and smoke of the big casinos. The only negative is the lack of fans in the bathrooms.

Since I hadn't been budgeting for a trip, I had to look for bargains. I found a good deal for the Saturday arrival at the Las Vegas Hilton, and saw that for about $25 more for the next two nights, I could move to the HGVLV. I really liked the idea of a kitchenette since I'm usually carrying a to-go box back to my room after dinners out on any vacation. With no microwave, well - whaddaya gonna do with it?! :>) Check-in was super. Right away, the Host/Concierge/Manager Robert took interest in making me feel special and welcome. I was given a wonderful 15th floor King Studio overlooking a golf course and facing toward the mountains and sunrise, which I loved. The bed was wonderful, and the kitchenette was just the thing for me to fix myself a drink or snack, or re-heat my to-go goodies, without having to dress and go downstairs or somewhere else, (although I did my share of that as well!) I had a rental car and bought myself some groceries and liquor at the Smith's grocery store off North Rancho. By signing up for the shopper card I saved $27 from my final total of $122 which included an apple pie (breakfast slice!) fruits, nuts, Brie, crackers, chips, a bottle of Stoly Citrus vodka which was on sale for $11 (!), a bottle of Ecco Dominici Pinot Grigio wine and this neat bottle opener/stopper gadget, a bottle of Jose Cuevero ready mixed Margueritas, Mr. & Mrs. T Bloody Mary mix, bottles of water, some makeup and a few souveniers as well. I actually brought a lot of this back home with me, (no liquor, but the other things I could pack) so my budget trip went very well. Even though I drank only about a third of the Stoly, for $11 it was definitely cheaper than buying drinks one by one somewhere out. Plus, I had my wonderful view to enjoy while sipping and enjoying my spur-of-the-moment R&R. The room already had a complement of Starbucks coffee pods for the coffeemaker, although I did make a run to the deli/grocery downstairs the next morning for more sugar and Half-N-Half. That morning I went to the pool downstairs. Even though it was November 19th, they were saying on the TV News that this near-record warmth was due to change on Tuesday, which would be the day I was leaving. The pool was heated, anyway. So I certainly enjoyed a November morning in the sun by the pool. I really liked the hotel toiletries. The lotion smelled wonderful. There was also a ironing board/iron, room safe and hairdryer, for those who need these items. In the morning, as a HHonors member, a USA Today hung on my doorknob outside. My room was quiet enough; I did hear muffled voices a few times from the neighbors, nothing irritating, just enough to know I wasn't totally alone up there. The room attendants were so friendly and accommodating. Any request I made was immediately and graciously handled. I thought I had lost my prescription sunglasses. The day I went to check out, I moved my rental car from the HGVLV parking lot around to the front to load my luggage.

My wife and I are both people who enjoy a 4-5 star hotel, we are not one's to nit pick at every little thing wrong with a hotel. So please keep that in mind when you read our review. We arrived at HGVC on Tuesday night, parking was a breeze. Not many times you can park your car and walk right into the hotel. Check in was a snap and the staff was quite friendly, no pushy sales pitch to buy a condo or anything. We had a 1bedroom suite, witch was clean and had all the little things we needed to make our stay enjoyable. I would recommend a high floor so you can look out unto the strip. Both my wife and I like to lay in the sun so the pool was wonderful, a bit small but that was no problem since people seem to come and go. They do have a nice little pool side bar and towels are furnished. Not much more than you could ask for. The HVGC is located on north end so if you plan on walking to strip you might think again since it is a bit of a hike. The closest casino was the Hilton right next door. (not impressed) The Rivera sits across the street along with Saraha. Both older casino but still lots of action if you are a gambler. If you have have a car I would just suggest just driving down to a local casino and use thier paking garage and accessing the strip from there. We did go out the Red Rock Casino, (wow). If you get a chance to go out there! We had dinner at the BBQ place (Salt Lick) and then a drink at the outside lounge. It was a perfect night. All and all HGVC is a good solid 4 star hotel. It is clean has everything you need for a fraction of the price you would pay staying on the strip.

This hotel was absolutely perfect for our stay. Check-in went very well, where we first met some of the friendliest, most helpful hotel employees I\u2019ve seen anywhere\u2026 and that\u2019s a big compliment from me. They continually remembered my name everytime I walked by, and they addressed my daughter by name too! They have an \u201cactive\u201d lounge\u201d and a \u201cquiet\u201d lounge, as well as a very well equipped deli/convenience store in the lobby. The deli opened at 7a each day, and served hot breakfast sandwiches, Starbucks coffee, etc. Full assortment of chips, beer, cokes, vino, etc. The pool was small, but that kept things manageable. (The Hilton\u2019s pool (next door) was an absolute zoo.) There was a small pool bar that served drinks at prices very close to the package prices in the convenience store. There are two very nice built-in grills by the pool gate. We had a Suite, which included a separate bedroom and a fully workable kitchen (more on that later). The greatroom area was also spacious, and had a fold out sofa. Both rooms had large flatscreen TVs, and the greatroom TV had a DVD player\u2026 meaning that our traveling Kiddo could watch her Dora DVDs on the big screen, instead of her 8\u201d portable. Bathroom had a nice sized shower, and Crabtree/Evelyn toiletries. A vertical washer/dryer unit was nice to have as well. The bedroom had a large whirlpool tub, and a too-small (note: only complaint here)closet. PERFECT, though, for a small family visit. Housekeeping was sparkling, and everything looked pretty darn new to me. Free wi-fi throughout the building, and reception was reliably between 28 and 54mbps both in our room and in the lobby area. Location is a caution here, depending on why you are in Vegas. It is directly next door (100 yards, tops) to the side entrance to the Hilton, through which you can walk almost all the way to the Convention Center. The Hilton\u2019s monorail stop is just another 50 feet further than the side door. From the monorail, you can get most places fairly easily. You cannot, though, walk to the strip\u2026 at least not with temps in the 105-110 range. Parking looked like it was free here. We spent the full six days here without wheels, and had no trouble getting around. The $8 for 24hrs of monorail was a very nice deal, and Kiddo is only 3, so she rides for free. So, if the Convention Center is your driver for being here, this is a great location, great facility, and great pricing. If you want to be in the center of the gaming action, this ain\u2019t it. In fact, there\u2019s no gaming in the HGVC at all\u2026 you have to head over to the Hilton. The HGVC does not, other than the deli, have dining\u2026 you have to walk to the Hilton\u2026 (which is fine, because you can charge back to the HGVC, and get HHonors points!) We ate at Quark\u2019s twice for lunch (good menu, reasonable prices, and Star Trek characters visit the tables). We also ate at the Paradise Caf\u00e9, and found the food acceptable, but not great. We had one dinner at the Benihana, as we thought Kiddo would enjoy it. They were helpful with her and her needs, and the cooking show is always fun. Should mention that we had one dinner at the Paris Hotel, at Mon Ami Gabi. Third time we\u2019ve eaten there, and it really is good. Excellent pricing, and the staff is a lot more friendly than up in the Eiffel Tower. Our waiter there was Dion, and he was superb\u2026 see my review at that restaurant for more. Back to the HGVC, though, and a further compliment about the staff. While here, we found that an old friend of ours was having his wife and two kids into Vegas after our conference ended. Since we had a kitchen, and they had two boys, we decided that it\u2019d be a heckuva lot cheaper to grill out and eat in our suite than to try to feed four adults (with vino) and three kids in a restaurant. I grabbed a cab over to a nearby grocery store, while Mrs. Gardiner visited the front desk to explain what we were up to\u2026 within 15 minutes there were two ladies from housekeeping at the door with another four place settings of dishes, glasses, new silverware (still in wrapper!) AND extra papertowels and soap, --- WOW! One of the housekeepers noticed that I had corn-on-the-cob sitting in a cardboard box and said \u201cYou can\u2019t serve friends from a cardboard box!\u201d, then returned five minutes later with a still-in-the-wrapper cooking sheet to serve from! Outstanding! To sum, we successfully prepared and served a full dinner for four adults and three kids... no problem. We grilled by the pool, using BBQ tools readily borrowed from the deli/convenience store, and carried steaks and corn back upstairs, and ate comfortably while the kids watched TV.

You can get your cabbies phone number and call him/her directly for a cab. The monorail is a great deal if you want to go down to the MGM as you can purchase a 10 ride ticket (good for a year) that can be shared by those with you. If its just you and another person thats $7.00 one way as opposed to an easy $20 cab ride. What makes this property so inviting is the fact that it is private and very quiet. The Las Vegas Hilton is a stone's throw from the HGVC and you can catch a cab or the monorail or just plain ole walk to the strip.

This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Everything was almost perfect. We had a one bedroom suite and it worked out great. The king bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable. The jacuzzi tub was really nice and great for relaxing after a long day walking around at the convention. The bathroom was huge and the shower was nice and big. Since we were there for 9 days, the washer and dryer unit in the suite was a big plus. We washed clothes a couple of times. There was a free box of detergent in the room, and we asked for more and got it. It was great having a full kitchen, even though we didn't use it a lot. We love eating out! The free internet was a huge help. All of the other places I have stayed, charge around 12.00 a day for internet. This adds up over a week. We rented a car, so when we wanted to see the sights of Vegas and go shopping, we could get around easily. Everywhere you go has plenty of parking and it is free. The money we saved on internet fees, paid for the car! Also, you park right in front of the hotel and go right up to your room. No smoke to walk through, that was a plus.
