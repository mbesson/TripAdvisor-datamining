We had a room at the front of the hotel. I struggle to understand why quite a few people say that the rooms are small, ours was perfectly adequate for our needs! At the end of the day you only sleep there! There was at least 2 feet around the bed, plus a desk and more room for bags etc... in the cove by the door! I believe the bed itself was too singles pushed together, but very comfortable (one of the pillows was rock hard though, luckily there were spares in the cupboard) The ensuite bathroom was nice as well, very clean. Overall a very clean, spacious, comfy room. At times the room got quite hot, but with the windows open and the air conditioning unit it quickly cools. Being at the front it did mean that it was quite noisy at times as the hotel is next to a tram line and main road, but it wasn't intrusive and its what you expect for being so close to the city centre. The staff were very friendly, all spoke english very well, the breakfast was nice (being English I struggle to understand the cheese and cold meat thing for breakfast!) but the cereal, pastries and breads were lovely! Plus they had tea bags available!! The staff recommended a restaurant round the corner, BoBo's I believe, and their pasta dishes were stunning!! We were also allowed to leave our bags at the hotel on our last day as we had an evening flight. It was about 20min walk to the colesseum / roman forum which was handy, and about 15mins in the other direction is the main train station. 2 mins away is a supermarket where we bought big bottles of water and snacks as it was more economical than buying things directly in the city. Thanks to the reviews of other people on this hotel, we were not surprised by the city tax that needs to be paid when you check out, I think it was 3euros per person per night.

I had researched this extensively using TA and chose the hotel on that basis; I was not disappointed. The neighbourhood is not great but certainly not as bad as some others have indicated. I think it best to stay on Via Principe Amedeo and Via di Porta Maggiore (the tram route). Allow for 20 minutes to walk from Termini but one can ride the Tram (No. 5 or No. 14) or the 105 Bus. They all leave from the front corner of the Termini station. I will add USEFUL TIPs as I write the review. The young man at the reception desk was extremely pleasant and helpful. He provided me with a street map and wrote additional transport information on it. He brought our baggage to the room. The room was small, and friends accompanying us got an even smaller room, but I had expected that from the reviews. The more important thing was the fact that the room was clean and in every regard functional. In fact the whole place was clean as the hotel has been completely refurbished. Breakfast was basic (cereals; bread rolls; croissants and ham/cheese) but tasty. The problem once again was the rather cramped dining facility. Most people chose to remain inside even though the weather was exceptional for October. There is a wi-fi but it did not work in my bedroom. It cost about 6 or 7 Euro for 3 hours. Transport tickets can be purchased at the news stand at Piazza di Porta Maggiore - out of hotel and turn left; walk less than 5 minutes and it is on the same side as hotel. I had never been in Rome before and was not really prepared for the 'transport'. Sardines in a tin spring to mind. Little wonder there is a problem with pick-pockets. There are so many people allowed on buses; metro and trams that it is a pick-pockets paradise. I caught a guy 'moving in' on me on the No. 3 bus. I promptly threw him off the bus at the next stop - NOT recommended for most people. A couple with us were victims on the same bus but the thief only got the hotel room pass which he discarded on the floor of the bus. The metro from Manzoni station is just as bad. Of course we were travelling during the rush-hour (perhaps rush-hours is more apt in Rome as it always seems busy) but anywhere near the centre or tourist sites makes for quite a challenge. It really must be a nightmare if one has young children. A visit to Trastevere is recommended and the No. 3 bus leaving from Piazza di Porta Maggiore (out of hotel and a five minute walk to the left) goes there. We also used the same bus to go to the Colosseum. We used the tram from Manzoni to the Vatican. That is out of hotel and turn right. Walk to the next major junction and turn left. The station is down this road. Allow around 10 minutes for this walk. If going to St. Peters then get off at Ottaviano. If going to the Vatican museums then stay until the next stop and get off there. If planning on both i recommend one goes to the Vatican Museum FIRST. When in the Sistine chapel look for the door on the right as you walk down it. This is exclusively for TOUR GROUPS but hook up with a group and walk out through that door. The exit for individuals leaving the Chapel is actually on the left and this will bring you back into the Museum complex. If you leave with a tour group you will be in St. Peters within a few minutes. This will save you 45-60 minutes as the other route takes you out on to the public street leaving you o walk to St. Peters and join the security queue. Incidentally we did not have tickets for the museum so had to queue. We arrived there at just after 9am and had to queue for 40 minutes (even in Oct). The other important issue is BACKPACKS. If you have a backpack you will likely have to leave it in security after you enter. No big deal but it will mean tracking back from the Sistine Chapel to recover it. This will mean no 'short cut' to St. Peters for you. The best restaurant from the hotel was up the street to the right and then the main street to the right (I think it was Manzoni) and the restaurant is on the right. This is 5 minutes from hotel and is popular. Incidentally no credit cards accepted. The best supermarket is out of hotel and up the street to the right. It is on the other side of the street at the bus/tram stop just on the corner of the first major junction. It is less than 5 minutes walk.

They kindly let us use the hotel kitchens fridge for our food, but it was quite annoying having to trouble them each time. Each day we would ask when it would be fixed, and it still wasnt fixed when we left. Extremely annoying! There is a nice courtyard on the roof top, where you can relax in the sun on a lounger.

We would definately reccommend this hotel for value for money! Wan to go back to Rome got the holiday blues already!

The bathroom was nicely decorated and the shower was divine! There were nice shutters and good double glazed windows. We didn't hear a sound all night apart from on the Saturday when a nearby disco played late into the night, but if it wasn't for the good quality windows we would have been disturbed!

There is a mini bar with fairly sensible prices for drinks etc and of course you can fill the fridge with your own drinks if required. There is also air conditioning, although we didn't require it on our trip. Breakfast was a buffet with a fairly limited range, cereals, pastries, cheese and meats etc, but it would have been nice to be able to get some fruit as an alternative to eat in a morning. Anyone with allergies to wheat or diary would struggle with the buffet. It's only about a 15 min walk from Termini so not too far when you are dragging your luggage along behind you. It took about 20 min to walk to the Collesseum. The area the hotel is in is not the nicest in Rome, and this I think is reflected in the price, but we never felt threatened or uncomfortable walking to or from the centre late at night. For those that cant handle the walking a taxi from the centre of town to the hotel cost about 10E. If you come out of the hotel and turn left you come to a piazza with some restaurants which we didnt discover until our last day, which is a shame as we would have loved to try them. To the right is a supermarket where you can buy anything else you might need. The staff in the hotel were lovely and very helpful whenever we needed anything. Our flights home were evening ones, but the hotel were happy to look after our bags for the day so that we were able to carry on exploring the city without worrying about them.

My mom and I stayed here for two nights in the first week of July 2010, and that was right after a 10-night cruise on the Celebrity Equinox. That having been said, even though we went from a luxury cruise liner to this little hotel, we still found it pretty good, considering how much we paid for the rooms. The area is not very difficult to find if you're in a taxi, and the hotel actually is rather close to Metro stations Termini (where we took the hop on/off bus) and Vittorio Emanuele. Easy walk to both; however, I would have to agree with everyone who said that it is a scary neighborhood to walk at night. There are many people (mostly groups of men) drinking and smoking on the sidewalks of the streets along Termini, so I suggest taking a right turn down Via Cavour from Termini (or any other street that would take you away from the back street), then make your way towards Via di Porta Maggiore. The streets have more human traffic, the lights are brighter, and there are shops and restaurants lining the streets. The hotel reception staff are really nice and they speak english well. They are very patient in answering whatever questions you have, and they will happily give you - for free - the most important tool you need: a map of the city. The housekeeping though had trouble communicating with us, especially when we took the wrong elevator and ended up on the wrong side of the hotel. Yes, there are two elevators, and if you are bringing heavy luggage and took the wrong one by mistake, you would have to go down to the hotel Trattoria just to switch elevators. It is not difficult, nor that much of a hassle; just a bit inconvenient. Point to remember: while checking in at reception, ask which elevator to take. We finally got to our rooms, which were even smaller than our inside staterooms on the ship; they were clean though, had a large cabinet, a safe inside said cabinet, and even a small refrigerator in the little cabinet underneath the writing desk. Our room was one of those with a balcony, but we weren't bothered by the noise outside. Maybe we were just really tired after a full day of sight-seeing, but for both nights, we slept really well. The bed is narrower than I'm used to and bouncy, but that didn't bother me or my mother. One thing that did bother me a little bit though, was the TV. There was nothing wrong with the unit, but there were no english channels except BBC news. This is insignificant for some, but for those who like to unwind with the TV, you would have to learn Italian to understand anything. The bathroom is bigger than I expected; I honestly expected a small cubicle of a bathroom, but this one was half the size of the bedroom. There was of course a toilet, a little secondary toilet for washing (i forgot what it's called), a good-sized sink with space on both sides for cosmetics and whatnots, a shower with enough space to shampoo your hair without hitting your elbows on the glass, and there was.. a HAIR DRYER (oh joy). The towels were changed everyday, toiletries were provided, the rubbish bins were emptied, and oh, I must not forget to mention that on the bedroom side of the bathroom sliding door is a HUGE mirror that is actually the entire size of the door; very important for girls like my me and my mother. The Trattoria is only open for breakfast, and the food I think, is outsourced from other bakeries and shops. It was the same for the 3 days that we were there: sweet pastries; bread rolls; cheese, ham, and salami slices; and different kinds of cereals to choose from. Of course there was also butter and soft cheese to spread on the rolls. The orange juice machine had pretty good juice; I did not try the coffee though, so I can't comment on that. Now, even though it's a rather limited buffet, it is still a buffet; so you can eat as many croissants and ham-and-cheese sandwiches as you want until you're full. In conclusion, it's not a bad place to be in, and I believe I would stay in this hotel again if I ever went back to Rome.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, friendly and convenient\u201d", "Author": "DenverTennisPlayer", "ReviewID": "UR64939259", "Content": "Hotel was nice.

It didn\u2019t really affect anything, it was just noisy and started at 7:00 in the morning. Perhaps they\u2019re putting in a pool. - The nighttime front desk clerk was not so good \u2013 he was okay with English but told us to \u201cfigure out restaurant locations ourselves\u201d. - Be prepared \u2013 the rooms are small, even for European rooms. But just enough room for two suitcases. - The hotel doesn\u2019t have a dishwasher, so the poor woman attending the breakfast area had to do all the dishes by hand, which meant at points there were no bowls, or no spoons, or knives, or coffee cups\u2026 - No washcloths; as per usual of all European hotels. Pros - Breakfast was free! At least I think it was free; we never quite figured out where to pay for it or how to put it on our bill, so we\u2019re only assuming. It was limited in choice, but still good for free \u2013 cereals (good granola, and something resembling cocoa puffs), baked goods, juice and coffee maker coffee. - Could control your own heat/air conditioning - perfect! Also could open the windows and adjust the shutters too. Made you feel like a true Roman. - Pretty close the Colosseum, about a 15 minute walk. - The daytime front desk clerk was great \u2013 he knew great English and always had a smile on his face. - The room was beautifully decorated! From what I read, all the rooms are immaculate, but room 401 was superb. Also, because the hotel is so new, the rooms were spotless and clean! - Very close the train station, which made it very convenient to take the train to Napoli and Firenze! - For as small as the room is, it had a fridge! Very convenient for storing some cheese bought at the supermarket. - Super new elevator \u2013 you know it\u2019s new because it has blue LEDs for the buttons. Though, the button for the downstairs floor where you eat breakfast has a down arrow when it should be an up arrow. Not sure if that\u2019s a bad sign or not. Tips - Water is a must, but don\u2019t be ripped off by the convenience store clerk down the street \u2013 walk just a bit further to your right and across the street you\u2019ll find a very reasonably priced supermarket, where you can buy 6 packs of water for 2 Euros! Remember to get \u201cnaturale\u201d water \u2013 the other stuff has bubbles, blech. - There are two or three good restaurants, even if the hotel doesn\u2019t know about them (they only recommend the one, it\u2019s okay, but I\u2019m not sure why.) Turn right out of the front door and go to the first intersection with traffic lights and turn right. Aim to eat dinner around 8 or later, if you want to be a true Roman.

We inquired at the front desk again and he told us the plumber was coming the next day. So we went to bed without showers. After 2pm the following day (more than 24 hours after the flooding), still nobody arrived so we asked yet another time. We were very frustrated because we were paying for amentities and we couldn't even shower. Eventually someone came that evening, way more than 24 hours later, and nobody even apologized. We should have been compinsated in someway. I should also mention they were not willing to give us another room. They said they were fully booked, although I am not certain. Finally, before you arrive get directions from the subway. It is hard to find the hotel when you get off the subway station if you do not already have the directions. It is not visible from the subway station by any means you have to go on a coule different streets.", "Date": "August 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201ca very nice experience at this hotel--an excellent find for us\u201d", "Author": "bur03", "ReviewID": "UR32349166", "Content": "there is a terrific market across the street from the hotel to pick up cheeses, fruits and yogurt, etc . to keep in the room.....breakfast was the same each morning and we did stay six nights...........a must is the gelato store two blocks away, however, not on a Sunday night being the wait is over and hour it seemed to be a family night ...the best treat after touring all day to sit down and enjoy...........the hotel was easy to get around Rome from................the front desk helpful and our room was kept very clean................being we were there for a number of nights we would have enjoyed putting on the t.v. and having english sub titles or a cnn chanel to view.................", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cnot bad, but NOT a 4 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "mspisars", "ReviewID": "UR31648076", "Content": "Not sure how they got their 4 star raiting, but there is no way this hotel can be rated as 4 stars.

It IS undergoing some work at the moment, but it didnt effect us at all, work didnt start until after 9am and stopped by 5pm, we WERE on the opposite side of the hotel though and i can understand it may be worse if you were right next to the work. The bedroom was tiny, we had a small overnight case and if we had had anything bigger we wouldnt have been able to move, that said, it was newly decorated, the bed was more comfortable than my one at home, and it had everything you need. The bathroom was also very small but all new and the shower was fab (although my other half at over 6 foot tall suffered a few knocked elbows as he tried to wash his hair), all in all though it was fine for 3 or 4 nights - any longer and you may get cabin fever. One thing i would suggest is requesting a room on the back of the hotel, ours was on the front and the road noise was quite bad, it is on a major road with buses, cars bikes and trams every few minutes (and you know how the Italians love to beep their horns) and the view wasnt worth the noise. It didnt stop us sleeping but some light sleepers may find it a problem, mind you if the road doesnt wake you up the usual inconsiderate shouting Germans will, so its not really worth worrying about!! Breakfast was great, fresh pastries and rolls from the bakery every morning, cereals and hot drinks and juice - we filled up at breakfast and didnt really need lunch! There are not really any places to eat near the hotel, but within a 10 min walk you can find some. In the main you cant go wrong, its good value for money, the rooms though small were new, clean and had everything you need, the front desk is manned 24/7, good breakfast and location for the sights and rail links. The only down point is its location within Rome, this is not a particuly nice area, its the poorest and most industrial part of the city, very very dirty and covered in graffiti, we were a little nervous walking from Termini to the hotel (which we had no problems at all finding by the way!!) and i imagine in high season there will be a lot of pick pockets and gypsies around the station, but although we were a bit edgy at first we had no problems at all, everyone was friendly enough and once you are used to the look of the place it doesnt seem so bad, there are also a lot of tourists about so you are not alone. At the end of the day you want a hotel next to the Trevi Fountain then you will pay 3 times the price of this one and it probably wont be in such a nice condition.

After exiting our cab, we had to search a bit as the hotel entrance is subtle, without an obvious sign except a red floor mat outside the small front door (for future reference, it's across the street from the big Fiat dealership). We were greeted cheerfully by the desk clerk who gave us our key and told us the times and place for breakfast each morning. He also provided a city map and outlined a detailed description of the streets, shopping, restaurants, and sights of Rome. Finally, he told us where to find the nearest metro line. Also helpful, he spoke excellent English. The hotel has a good location, out-of-the-way but within walking distance (when not lugging heavy bags) of a city tourism office, the Coliseum, and several other sights. Also in the area: metro access, a couple of small grocery stores, and a cheap pizza place that is open late. We stayed in a spacious room with two twin beds and tasteful decor - black with pale gold accents. One perk: there were enough electrical outlets for us to plug in our computers and charge our cellphones and cameras. Another: the lights and TV work only when the room key is in its slot on the wall, helping to prevent guests from a) losing the room key and b) wasting electricity by leaving a light on when they leave. Our view out of the shuttered window was of the rooftops and backyards of the buildings behind the hotel. The bathroom had two shower heads - one normal and one rain - and the towels were huge. Breakfast in the morning was ample: bread, butter/jam/honey, cheese, pastries, cereal with milk, coffee/tea/hot chocolate from an espresso machine, and orange juice.
