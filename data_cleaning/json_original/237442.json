The reviews sounded ok and the price was right for us - a middle aged couple. We took the ACTV bus from Venice Marco Polo airport and (according to the map) the bus dropped us off just a block away. Well, the drivers instructions and the map were both a little incorrect. We spent 1 hour dragging 2 large suitcases around trying to find the hotel, we asked several locals and no one seemed to know exactly where this hotel was, we finally asked someone who happened to have a cell-phone on which he was able to get directions and took us directly to the front door. I will warn you that it is a little hard to find but well worth it when you do. The hotel is not overly fancy, but it is clean, the staff welcoming and the continental breakfast was just superb. We arrived before the check-in time but were told that we could store our cases behind the desk and shown a toilet where we could freshen up. The desk staff gave us directions to Mestre square - just around the corner -which was totally pedestrianised and had shops and restaurants etc.Nice area to stroll around after a supper - very safe with lots of families strolling around as well.The staff also directed us to a really nice restaurant with excellent food for our evening meal. They were very accommodating and so pleasant. Our room was lovely and clean, good beds, clean bathroom and very quiet. In the morning rather than take a bus to the cruise ship dock in Venice we opted for a taxi - not very bright as it cost us almost as much as the hotel room - but it did get us there quickly and we didn't have to pull luggage behind us. Next time to Venice area we will stay again", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stanley, Falkland Islands", "Title": "\u201cRun down and dirty\u201d", "Author": "Archie48", "ReviewID": "UR118231648", "Content": "Stayed here four nights, booked two double rooms.

This was our worst stay of a month long trip around europe, by miles and miles. I'll just list what was wrong: - The room smelt bad, we had to keep a window open the whole time, as a consequence we had street noise, cold at night and mosquitos in the room - The room was not in good condition, rusty fittings, some broken - One morning there was no hot water, and we had to take cold showers, staff were not particularly apologetic, and no further action was taken - There were no additional bedclothes in the room, and my girlfriend was cold during the night - The showers (there were 2 heads in the room) were both broken and showering was unpleasant - Reception was often unattended, even though the room keys are hanging there in easy reach - The staff insisted on taking my car keys (even though there was no reason to move my car as it was on the inside) and left them sitting with the room key unattended and obvious - The internet setup involved changing detailed network settings on my laptop, and the staff member who made the changes was not available on checkout to repair my settings - There were also minor issues, for example the staff were unable to recommend a place for dinner in Mestre, but these were no significant compared to the major issues listed", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Aurora Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d237442-Reviews-Aurora_Hotel-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$59 - $145*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piazzetta Giordano Bruno 15</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30174</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "237442", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5e/4e/5e4ef8a630c61a43c2e7e2cabad4a5256large.jpg"}}
