We arrived at the India that is the tube station to get off for the travelodge. You will need to go down one flight of stairs and cross over the bridge that is above a very busy main road. If you cannot managed the stairs then you may use the lift at the tube station. We walked over the bridge then it is down a flight of stairs and walk past a monument on your right and straight ahead it looks like a dead end, with metal railings but keep going and you will see a gate opening, go through that and around the corner and there is the travelodge. I would like to add before we arrived, I rang the lodge to see if we could split our two nights up one at Doclands and one in London. I was informed to ring reservation, when I rang were not open. We booked in, I asked could we have one night here and one in central London, I was told to ring Superbreaks, as this is who it was booked with, (we did not book this break, it was a gift) we were informed of our room first floor as we walked up stained carpets, walls all needed painting you could smell airf resher had been sprayed, not good. The carpets need to be lifted up and new ones laid and all walls painted and new doors. (There is a lift here if you require to use it). We walked along the corridor, doors all marked more staines, I was dreading it, opened the door, yes basic, staines on the carpet everywhere, sick staines, needed painting and a good clean only on bath towel in the room bathroom not clean, quilt cover as not an off white, settee stained, I sat on the chair (plastic) only thing I would sit on whilst the kettle was boiling, looked at the bed and could see a large mark but not on the cover, stripped the cover off to find what looked like a large blood stain. I could not sleep in the bed, I looked at other hotels immediatley to move out, but so expensive, I ended up sleeping in the plastic chair for my two nights. Could not wait to get home to my own home comforts. The lodge has a bar, and breafast is served for I think \u00a37.99 we did not take this up, there is nothing around you no other pubs or eating places that we found. We plan to go back to London, but we will book everything ourselves and stay in central London. Too many tubes to think about getting to the Docklands and we would never go back to the Travel lodge again. (Staff did not even say good morning when you past the staff on a morning) The big bus to go around London is \u00a327.00 you can get on and off as many times as you like, a free river cruise is included well worth it about two hours for the river you may want to allow. So much to see and we could not do it all in two days, people in London who we spoke to we general freindly could not fault them really. We went to a show at Victoria Palace which is right outside Victoria tube staion a toddle we thought, tubes are every two minuets brill service could not fault it. We left the show half way through as we were not sure, if we stayed till the end would we be too late for connections back to lodge. Coffee shops are a huge business in London, Beer is approx. \u00a33.75 a pint, I do not drink so it was \u00a32.00 for a soft drink it will depend on where you go. Looking now to go back, we did go to Harrods, well you have too don't you.... what a fab shop door men (In Green Outfits) really helpful could not fault any of the staff, we came into contact with..

Although this hotel was nowhere near the gig venue (which was in Camden) for the price of \u00c2\u00a315.00 it was far and away the best value in London even amongst the other Travelodge's in the area. It was also convenient as were coming in by train to Stratford and it really is easy to get to this hotel from Stratford. The hotel is literally 3-4 minutes from East India DLR. To avoid confusion, take the footpath across the main road and continue to walk straight. You will see some security gates blocking the road but there is still pedestrian access and the Travelodge is through there. Contrary to previous reviews there is a signpost showing 'Hotel' within East India Docks but I can see why people have found it difficult to find. The hotel itself looks new and modern from the outside fitting in well with the rest of the developments in the area. Unfortunately, the much touted self check in machines were not working so we had to queue for five minutes to be checked in by Reception, staff were efficient if not exactly pleased to see us. We were on the ground floor in room 4. The room was standard Travelodge. We have stayed in many and we expect little more than a clean and functional room, this ticked all the boxes and as an added bonus we got an extremely powerful shower to boot. The bed was above average for the chain and we even managed to get an extra pillow for the room after the gig from Reception. The guy on the front desk was a little happier and wished us a pleasant night. Now the but.... After getting to sleep at 12.30am we wanted a decent nights sleep and more importantly a nice lay in. After all check out is not until 12pm at Travelodge. To our astonishment at 9am, with both of us sound asleep, we were rudely woken by a maid (we assume it was a maid anyway) who tapped on our door with a keycard and then proceeded to enter the room, despite the 'do not disturb' sign being on the door. After I shouted, the 'maid' closed the door and without a word of apology continued up the corridor doing exactly the same with other doors in our corridor. I find this behaviour totally unacceptable, even at a budget property. If I had been a) awake and b) at least partly dressed I would have confronted the 'maid' but I think I had made my feelings known in no uncertain terms anyway. On checkout I had hoped to discuss this with Reception but typically nobody was on the desk and despite ringing the bell for attention still nobody came to help. I am giving this a 3* rating as it is a fine Travelodge, not the best I have stayed in but certainly better than some of the worst. However, the experience with the unauthorised entry really did take the shine off our stay but as long as this is/was an isolated instance there is some serious value to be had by staying here. I would recommend it for anybody staying in London for a short trip as it really isn't far on the DLR into Bank but it is probably more suited for gig goers at the O2, or even people wishing to see the Olympic sites and shop at the Westfied Shopping Centre in Stratford. For \u00c2\u00a315 a night, it really cannot be beaten.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cOk for O2!\u201d", "Author": "emylou123", "ReviewID": "UR124258360", "Content": "This is another bog standard travelodge, clean, comfortable, dont expect too much...Good location for the O2 and DLR, but not too easy to find, its kind of hidden away with no signs...all in all, a pleasant stay and fairly cheap.

On the first night the beds were not made. Despite there being, 2 adults and 2 children, only 2 sets of towels were given - although more were given on request. Due to a mix up with Superbreak, our rooms had been booked for the wrong date - luckily I had my paperwork and we were still allowed to stay, but our room key kept locking us out and we had to get it reactivated every evening at reception. But the biggest minus by far, was at breakfast on the second morning of our stay, now this being a Travelodge I didn't expect a dress code, but did expect a 'get dressed' code. A group of 4 girls came down to breakfast in their pyjamas - correction 3 were in their pyjamas and the 4th in underwear.

I got a good deal on this buget hotel for two nights it cost \u00c2\u00a390 for two people. Not bad considering you really are only 2 stops from the O2 and only 20 mins to central london on the tube. Yes the carpet was a little bare in places. Yes the pillows were not the greatest but we had 3 in the room. Shower was OK. As for the noise i have to say i didn't notice it. Infact it was louder when i stayed on Oxford Street in a much more expensive hotel. In total i spent very little time in the hotel ( awake ) and i guess you will be doing the same. The breakfast was very good and at \u00c2\u00a37 not overpriced , the bar was OK for a quick drink after a long day in London. Reception was fine as were other members of staff. About as good as can be given the price. Overall i would go back to this hotel if i was going to an event in the O2 but i would make sure you got a good deal first. For what i paid i cannot complain if i had paid over \u00c2\u00a3100 per night i would have been very dissapointed.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNice place but would want something more central next time\u201d", "Author": "Warno", "ReviewID": "UR120742300", "Content": "I stayed here 3 nights in may of 2011.

The lack of cleanliness both in the rooms and communal areas. I'm talking about dusty surfaces, carpets that are ancient and need replacing, mould in the showers, cobwebs in the restaurant. 2. Pretty dire buffet breakfast - the sausages are awful and the egg is powdered and looks more like mashed potato.

That it is near a DLR instead of a Tube station makes it a little more troublesome. The surroundings are very quiet at night, you probably won't be able to get much food within a 5-10 min walk.

After deciding (rightly as it turned out) to exit the station via the footbridge over the dual carriageway, rather than continue down to street-level, and then after a while almost accidentally sighting the hotel, I ended up walking all the way around the block and a way down the main road, because I didn't spot where the hotel entrance was. Not a big deal on a light summer's evening, just took me longer than necessary to get there. But if I was travelling on my own on a dark winter's night, in an unfamiliar part of London and past big anonymous buildings - a few signs to point the way wouldn't go amiss.

Why not just paint \"It's a budget hotel\" on the wall above reception as that is the standard response to all enquiries!!

We arrived early and requested that we pay for the extra early check in to check in at 12 noon, and wew told that this has to be pre booked and there was no way we could do this, despite explaining to the receptionist that I have a disablilty and need to rest throughout the day. We were welcome to pay for the car parking and to leave our things in the car and to come back at 3pm (which was impossible as we had to be at o2 at 3pm) Left hotel and came back at 2pm after trying to waste time and aggravating my condition, we washed and chagnged in the toilets and enquired to see if we would be able to go into the room as soon as we returned from our event due to my condition. We were then told that they have early check in facility and we could go to the room immediatley for \u00c2\u00a310. We were basically told that we could have booked this earlier and that if I had gone onto my mobile and updated my booking online we also would have been able to check in at 12 noon (I was not a happy bunny) We advised that it was now a waste of money to pay for that at that time as we needed to leave to go to the O2. When we returned and finally returned to our room, the first thing we noticed was a huge semen stain on the sofa (not nice especially when there are children with you) We then noticed only drinks facilities for two (the room was booked for three) Had to go downstairs to get cups etc. Then we noticed that the whole room had been set for two, we had our own towels so had to go back for bedding. Bathroom was grubby Went to resturant it took 50mins for starter and main course to arrive together, customers who ordered after us had received their meal prior to us and had ordered the same. The meal came with chips when we opted for mash. When we advised we ordered mash, waitress said mash finished is that ok, I advised it would have to be as they did not let us know prior to this and give us the option to change our mind. At that the plate was taken away, the waitress returned and said we do mash now it will be 5 mins is this ok. We had waited 50 mins another 5 would make no difference. Anyway when food finally came I think the mash was leftovers off someone elses plate, mine had brown bits as though it had been placed next to some other food whilst my friends did not but had pepper on. All of the food was cold apart from the gravy. we did not eat the food. Returned to the room laid out the bedding we received earlier and there was blood stains on the duvet, this was supposed to have been taken out of the linen room. Closed the curtains there was mould on the window sill. Came out of bathroom, door handle came off in our hand (had to screw it back on) Pulled back the sheets and there were black hairs in the bed that could have been animal hairs. By this time it was passed midnight Decided there was no way we were staying and that we would travel for 4 hours to get home despite feeling extreme pain from my condition. Advised manager on reception that the room was disgusting and that it seemed like it had not been cleaned from the previous occupant told about blood, semen and mould and terrible actions by staff.

We were travelling from far and the last thing you want is to turn up and find a dirty hotel, the way some of the reviews had described..... After speaking to a family friend who used to live nearby the hotel and had stayed in it because of business a few times, we decided that we would trust their judgement. They said it was briliant for what you pay, and to sum it up, it really was. There was NO mould on the curtains, fingernails on the carpets, dirty sheets etc...... I have no idea where all of this is coming from, and to be honest, how close were these people inspecting the carpet to find a fingernail?!!!! Also, as with all carpets even in people's houses, people have worn shoes over them and so its obviously not going to be clean enough to eat off!!!! However, the carpet WAS hoovered and clean ( and we are neat freaks and clean freaks and I don't usually stay in a hotel below a 4 star, we always stay in 5 star hotels, so I am a bit of a snob - even at my university accomodation, i have a deluxe room as I am used to luxury!). The room, the bathroom, was all clean. The only thing about the room I would have improved is a more comfortable sofabed - or a double sofa bed would be better as the ones here are single mattresses 1 each for 2 people, and the room was also really cold as there was only one heater and it would not heat up very quickly. But these are all small things, considering the snob I am, I couldn't believe how comfortable I was in the room. We were walking without our shoes on. We kept our socks on because it was cold, but honestly, our room was clean. One more thing is the other travelodge I have stayed in, in Manchester, had a larger family room with a lounge area and a bed area round the corner, so it was huge. This room was smaller than that, but was still big enough for 4 of us! Obviously with hotels you can't assess all rooms to be the same. Maybe some people did stay in bad rooms, but I highly doubt they are as bad as what some reviews say, as there were a lot of families staying there with young children, and even we had a young child with us, and everything was fine. We didn't have breakfast because we don't usually eat breakfast, but the service of the receptionists and bar tender were really friendly and I have no complaints. It WAS worth the money and was much better than some 4 star hotels I have stayed in in London!! This is the second travelodge I have stayed in - and both were brilliant. If you do get a room you are not happy with, ask very politely downstairs and they will move you, but you can't be rude to the receptionists as its not their fault if its not cleaned properly!

There are facilities to make coffee in your room, which doesn't taste too bad. You can pick up breakfast snacks near the DLR or at the service station about a 5 minute walk away. If you do buy the breakfast, it's actually worth the money if you or your friends/partner like a cooked English breakfast. I just ate the croissants and muffins, but it was nice to have the choice, The trick to getting breakfast to yourself is to go relatively late in the morning, around 9:30 am (breakfast runs until 11!)

There isn't really anywhere to eat around the hotel - but you are in London, so you could just get the tube and eat in some brilliant restaurants; we went to the Bento Cafe in Camden. The room is very basic and the fabric on our sofa was worn. There was limescale in the toilet bowl, but this is difficult to get rid of in London because Thames Valley Water is very hard. Otherwise, the room, towels and linen were all very clean. The rooms are also quite big for a budget European city hotel. The plumbing and shower strength are better than what I have at home. The staff are quite friendly, though we did get some funny looks when we left the room in fancy dress. The bar was open until late and was reasonably priced by London standards.

It's easy to find from the DLR station (East India). Just cross the footbridge signposted for the town hall and it's just behind the big office blocks. It's a 2-3 minute walk. On the other side of the station, you have a supermarket that's open til 10pm (8pm on Sundays) where you can pick up some basic provisions.

The hotel is based on what is really a nice Industrial Estate, if driving you need to be let in, to parkers in the car park try to stay to the right hand side as most of the vandalism is caused to cars on the left hand side (just past the bar). Reception will try to sell you the breakfast for \u00c2\u00a37.50 per head, dont bother with this as if you walk out of the hotel and bear right , take a right at the first park bench on the right hand side (5 min walk) you will find an Italian restraunt (very average but only \u00c2\u00a35 a meal), a newsagents (great for cheaper drinks (open till 6pm) and best of all a sandwich shop / cafe (open until about 3pm) -its just past the newsagents that does a superb Bacon sandwich for \u00c2\u00a32.50 or a full english for \u00c2\u00a34. There is also a store that does alcohol over the DLR bridge on the other side which is well priced and open until at least 10pm. The Hotel itself is basic, typical Travelodge fair and could do with some TLC, the room (stayed on upper floors) was of adequate size, bed was clean, seat was bloody awful and uncomfortable while the bathroom had some mildew and grot around the toilet and curtain, but just about acceptable. One major issue I found with the staff was that it was nearly impossible to get a replacement loo roll, in the end I gave up and bought a pack from the store, another thing I never understand is why you always only get 3 pillows, credit to the reception I got another when I asked (Although the first offered was dirty) All said and done its a basic but acceptable hotel if all you want is a base, just dont expect any frills or extras, ok for 2-3 days but any longer than that is pushing it unless you are on a very tight budget. Transport links are reasonably good with Canary Wharf being 10 mins away on the DLR and central London being about 20-25 away. I would say eat or bring something back as the bar is reheated stuff and not worth the elevated prices but there is not anything close bar the DLR to Canary Wharf (Heron Quays for the excellent shopping centre which houses Nando's, Tiffinbites, Burgers and the all great Wagamama (ate there 3 times :))", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cDo Not Stay Here With Children\u201d", "Author": "Wotnohair", "ReviewID": "UR37503291", "Content": "With two children aged 3 and 6, a family room was booked.On arrival on Sunday 9th Aug 2009 we were told that everything was made up and ready.

After reading some of the reviews on the site we were wondering what had happened to this hotel since we had last stayed and were worried about what we were going to find. We had heard from a relative that at least three cars had had their windscreens smashed when they stayed in January and were thinking about cancelling altogether however, you can not find a hotel for even double what we paid. \u00c2\u00a329 per night for the rooms (we had two as we have three children) and \u00c2\u00a36.75 per Adult breakfast if you pre book. Children eat free. We requested two rooms next to each other on a high floor and that is exactly what we got. It is true that you get to a certain extent what you pay for. The hotel is tired round the edges. Carpets could do with replacing and when we did use the toilet on the ground floor there was a foisty sort of smell that other reviews have mentioned. However, on Floor 4 it was fine. Our rooms were spacious and very clean. The only fault that I could find were two chewing gum type stains on the carpet in one of the rooms which was not pleasant but just shows the lack of respect with which some guests treat their accomodation! There were fans in our room which was a pleasant surprise. The staff are doing the best they can with what they have to work with and we could not fault the service that we received at all. Very friendly and helpful. We requested extra towels and pillows and we got them. They were then replaced in our room on a daily basis. The towels smelt fresh and the sheets were changed regularly. The rooms were cleaned very well and all the tea/coffee etc restocked. Breakfast was not the Hilton but by far the best we have had in any travelodge. The hotel was extremely busy but everything was always available food wise; some times there was a queue to be seated and a short wait for clean mugs/ plates etc but service was always perfect despite the stress of coping with lots of hungry customers. We had dinner two nights too and this was ok for the money. The car park now seems to be manned 24 hours and the attendants are extremely helpful. There were no incidents that we were aware of and we felt extremely safe in this area. It is at most a five minute stroll to the East India DLR and then perhaps twenty minutes to either Towergate or Bank.

The next morning we went down to reception and asked for the sheet to be changed, what looked like a manager was on the same side of reception desk as us and advised the reception staff that although we'd only been there one night it should be changed as it should never have been put on when ripped, we went out for the day returned at 10pm to find sheet had not been changed, I was so annoyed as we had been told it would be done that despite the time we went down to reception to complain. The result?! We were given a sheet to put on the bed ourselves, we do not work for travelodge!! If there are no specific cleaners then another member of staff should have changed the sheet!!

I booked the hotel with my friend for one night as we were going to a concert in the 02 and after searching through various hotels it seemed both very cheap and well located for our visit. And it was. Just a five minute walk to East India DLR station and then one stop on that before getting on the tube for one more stop to North Greenwich, it was ideally located and overnight parking was just \u00c2\u00a35. (Coming home from the O2, it was also handy as it seemed that most people were travelling towards the city centre and as we were going the opposite way, we were back at the Travelodge in about 20 minutes.) But that's where the good points stop for us. The main room itself was scruffy, bordering on dirty - with marks on the duvet, ominous white stains on the rather dilapidated sofa, dirty net curtains and poly-fillered holes in the wall. However, the bathroom was worst of all. Mould all over the roof, the area around the sink hadn't been cleaned before we arrived, the shower curtain was yellowy brown (and should have been white) and there was a loose wire and ugly holes where a notice told us a heated towel rail should be. We couldn't shut the door to the bathroom either as if you did you would get locked in as the door could only be opened from the outside. All this seemed very odd to me for somewhere that looked quite new and had a fancy flat screen television - personally I would have thought that a new shower curtain, lick of paint and some cleaning materials would have been more important. For one night it was bearable but any longer and we would have either asked to be moved or gone elsewhere.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SELBY, NORTH YORKSHIRE", "Title": "\u201cperfect loction for o2 arena! only 2 tube stops! \"dont forget your swimmers!\"\u201d", "Author": "SELBYLOU", "ReviewID": "UR12401473", "Content": "After much searching on the net I opted to book this Travelodge as it appeared to have the best location with regards to the O2 arena, I wasnt disappointed. On leaving Kings Cross we got on the tube to Holborn (Picadilly Line DARK BLUE) then from Holborn get the tube to Bank (Central Line RED) then from Bank get the DLR to East India. When you arrive at the station make sure you leave at the correct exit (sign posted for the docks I think)! Continue to walk forward, you will pass Nutmeg Lane on your right, the hotel is literally a few mins from the station, you will think you are in the wrong area but you arent. Upon arrival at the hotel the reception area was very busy, it would seem everyone who was off to see the Spice Girls opted to stay here as it was so close!! The check-in could have been better as for the amount of people checking in there was only one member of staff on! We were given the card key to room 31. The room was smallish but it was fine! The room itself was ok and clean compared to other Travelodges I have stayed in in the past. However the bathroom was a bit disappointing. You will see the bits of grime and dirt on the pictures I have attached. This was just a case of the room hadnt been cleaned to a high enough standard. The shower curtain smelt foisty, myself and my friend were conscious of it touching us whilst we showered. The shower was a serious cause for concern with regards to our safety! When we showered (using the shower curtain as a barrier from main bathroom) the water went onto the bathroom floor which is to be expected, the only problem was there was no means of drainage to get rid of the water, therefore the water didnt have anywhere to go, we didnt want to use towels as we needed the ones that had been provided. During our one night stay the water remained on the bathroom floor and we had to ensure we had footwear on to enter the bathroom to avoid a slip or fall. I advised reception of the problem and they apolgised. We left the hotel at around 6pm as we needed to get some food before the concert and the hotel bar didnt open till 6pm which was too late for us as we had a concert to attend. The distance from the hotel to the O2 is perfect. You board the DLR at East India and go one stop to Canning Town, you then jump on the tube to North Greenwich (Jubilee Line GREY) you arrive in no time at all and the North Greenwich is just outside the O2 arena!

That said, I wouldn't stay there again. We booked for two nights as it was near to the o2 arena and we had tickets for Led Zeppelin. The room, although cheap, was very small and dull. The biggest gripe I had was the bedside lights. One side was working, but the other wasn't. To make matters worse, there was no bulb in it!! Perfect for an electrifying weekend! I reported this to the reception and was told it would be sorted out promptly. It still had no bulb when we left nearly 48 hours later.. The check-in was painfully slow and seemed to be unprepared for the major event taking place nearby that weekend. One person on duty was not good enough. Several of the customers had travelled from all over the globe for this concert and were NOT impressed. The location is OK -ish IF the DLR was running. The Sunday we arrived it wasn't. We had to have a bus transfer AND a walk, in the rain not knowing where we were going. Most definitely NOT the fault of Travelodge, but it exposed the limitations of it's position in Docklands. Buses and taxis were available, but there were huge traffic problems around that area due to the silly ticketing arrangements for the Zep concert. Next time out, (the concert and the o2 were fabulous by the way) we will stay somewhere more Central London. The marginally longer tube journey would be well worth it.

The transport is great, as the DLR East India station is right on the hotel's doorstep. This is the first time I have stayed in a Travelodge (my friends swear by them), and it was way better than the regular London hotels I have stayed at in the past (you know the type... advertised as 2 or 3 star, but in reality are disgusting dumps). I found the main lobby area to be very well presented, which gave a really good impression of the place. The receptionist was polite and did her job well. Good points: 1) Location to East India DLT - brilliant to be honest - with quick access to the o2 arena and central London 2) Out of the way of central London - great to get away from all that noise and huste and bustle 3) Feels very secure - inside and out. Room keycard needed for corridors as well as rooms 4) No idiot guests - i.e. no running up and down the corridors all night 5) Problems dealt with quickly by manager - my first room had faulty lighting and I was switched to another room quickly 6) Honest cleaners (well, at least one) - I left a lot of loose change (counted about \u00c2\u00a38 in slummy) and left it in my room during the day due to my pockets being full. Every penny was there when I got back, after the cleaner had been in. To be expected I suppose, but still impressive :) 7) Cafe on site. Serves main meals and breakfast buffets. Also a few vending machines and internet PC's in main lobby 8) Rooms basic but very well presented and generally \"clean\" (i.e. no torn furniture, stained bedsheets, mold on walls etc..) 9) Excellent bathrooms. Well decorated and with large shower area 10) WiFi in rooms Bad points: 1) Seems to me that the whole of London lies under a flight path - even more so here :) 2) General traffic noise is high 3) No air conditioning. It was generally cool but typically muggy, so felt slightly uncomfortable with the window closed. Must be horribly sticky in summer 4) Poor cleaning. They may not be thieves, but they sure as hell can't clean 100%. Floor unhoovered, mugs not cleaned properly etc.. Cleaners were all eastern europeans who smirked to each other whenever a guest walked past. Creepy really :( 5) Check your kettle. Mine was thick with limescale and looked like paint peeling from a wall. Disgusting :( Took me 5 minutes to clean.. why the cleaners don't check them is beyond me 6) Being in the middle of nowhere, it can feel pretty intimidating at night. It's in the middle of an industrial estate type area. 7) Breakfast buffet may be all-you-can-eat, but the standard and variety is pretty poor. \u00c2\u00a37.50 as well :( 8) Poor TV channel selection. Would be nice for all Freeview channels to be available (no excuse really) Despite it's faults, I would stay here again - mostly based on security reasons. I don't trust regular London hotels, but this place felt secure. The rooms may not be cleaned 100%, but they are \"clean\".
