We were there for 3 nights and we ended up staying on the top floor in the Jr. Suite. (Europa room??) We had stayed at another hotel the night before and had to move as it was SO noisy from the disco on the beach. Your hotel was a wonderful, peaceful haven to go to. It was spotlessly clean, offered a continental breakfast each morning, you gave us beach towels to use, and we were greeted each day with a smile. There was plenty of hot water and great water pressure. The price was reasonable. We loved our deck facing the back courtyard and spent time out there sipping a drink and chatting in peace and quiet. The location is perfect on the main avenue but you feel like you are miles away as it is so peaceful. The free internet was a bonus too. We won't hesitate to recommend your hotel and it will be our first choice should we return to the Mayan Riviera.

We had a rental car and as the hotel is on a pedestrian only street,we had to park, find the hotel, ask where the nearest parking lot was, go back to the car, find that lot, then come back to the hotel and check in. No porter or anyone to help schlep the bags. Apparently it was porters day off. Manager at check in was rude when I asked her to write down name of parking lot. Here's a bright idea let people know about lot and location ahead of time when you take credit card information. I paid the entire room fee in cash at check in but was asked to give my credit card as a deposit. When I asked why the hotel needed a deposit when I had just paid in full things got nasty. The manager seemed outraged at what I considered a reasonable question. How audacious a guest questioning a confusing policy! She snapped it was due to the minbar which had about $5. USD worth of stuff in it. During my stay I was greeted with sneers while my partner got smiles. At check out, again no porter I told her I found her most inhospitable. She retorted that she found me disrespectful at check in. I replied that it is my right to ask a reasonable question and that Mexico is a democracy and perhaps she should work in Saudis Arabia. I reminded her that I was the guest and spending money at her hotel and not the other way round. Great hotel, I would stay again and just hope the owners had the good sense to fire her, and promote Kristin. Let people know in advance where your parking arrangements are and where. At 135 USD have someone there to help guests with bags to and from lot, at check out i had to hire my own bicycle richshaw driver as the manager could care less. Lesson three: don't hassle guests and loose all goodwill for $5 worth on minibar stuff. We are not all theives! Plus the hotel already had my credit card info from check in. Manager made a point of telling me maid had already checked minibar and that nothing was missing! Manager is getting too long in the tooth and it shows.

Great showers; clean rooms and hotel; beautiful accents ; perfect location and did I mention the girls that run the place? Oh yes I did, but I can't say enough. It was so hard to say good-bye. You can't go wrong chosing this place to stay.

The hotel is lovely with beautiful decorations, a pretty garden, nice architecture and colors throughout.

The beach is only a short walk, plenty of places to change currency, an internet cafe just around the corner. We loved the Yaxche restaurant close by -- the only one in town, I think, that is authentic Yucatecan food. The service in the hotel was excellent, the rooms were clean, and we enjoyed the Carnivale parades from the stoop in front of our hotel. The only problem that some folks might have is the noise. Be sure to get a room facing the garden if you're a light sleeper. Unfortunately, the garden room didn't help us because the Carnivale activities were going on a couple of blocks from the hotel (in an area facing the garden or back of the hotel) and they kept going until 3 a.m. One night I couldn't sleep; the next I slept like a log. So...just depends on your habits. Still, I'd go back in a minute and do it all over. It was such fun. When we were leaving at the airport we met a couple who had been to Playa for a week and stayed in a big resort on the beach and didn't even know Carnivale was going on!

It was fab! We turned up on the day and they gave us a special cheap room rate, as it was last minute. The room itself was massive with lots of storage space and the biggest bed I've ever seen! The decor was was Mexican...browns, greens, blues, reds etc. None of this minimalist rubbish.......Very tastefully done. The bathroom had a lovely powerful & hot shower, I liked the decor in the bathroom. The room had climate control .... so you could select the temperature you wanted in to be. This was great as it meant that you didn't wake up freezing after leaving the Air-con on full whack. The climate control was much quieter than regular aircon so it didn't interupt your sleep. The Hotel overlooks the main street in Playa del Carmen, so it was lovely to sit out of the balcony & people watch, before getting ready for a night out. This makes it a bit noisey when trying to get to sleep, but the hotel provided earplugs to help with this. That siad, I had one of the best nights sleep I had in ages as the bed was sooooo very comfy, the temperature was perfect and there was not the constant whirring of an air-con unit. The minibar is very reasonably priced. Complimentary breakfast is on offer .... this includes toast & jam, cereal, tea, coffee & juice. Its not super exciting or posh but if you are on a budget then its a free meal! Breakfast is served in the garden, which is very nice.

As other reviewers have stated--it is difficult to find anything new to say. We loved our stay. I had read about Lunata on Tripadvisor and on my last trip to Playa, I was one of those people who stepped inside the property to get a better look. It was perfectly perfect. During our stay I was happy to speak to other \"visitors\" about the hotel. So what can I add? We had a suite facing the courtyard with two double beds and a balcony during the first week in Feb. When we had to change our plans , well in advance of that week, the staff was very accomodating. I took beautiful pictures, but you've already seen the same type of beautiful pictures on this site. The hotel may want to include some of those type of shots on it's web page - especially the entrance hallway with the garden glowing in the back and the stairway angle looking down to the lobby at night. Those shots sold me! When we first arrived, we were very early and the staff allowed us to leave our two pieces of luggage in the office. We felt that our belongings were safe. When we checked in, the woman behind the desk walked up to our room with us along with the nice man carrying our luggage. The maid introduced herself to us in the lobby. The (19 year old?) girl at the desk took the time to recommend where I could buy a bracelet like hers for my teen daughter. I only wish we would have been there long enough, and my memory would have been \"fresh\" enough, to remember all of their names! There were really no big surprises. They didn't have a hair dryer and I knew that was a possibility. I also knew that I might have to bring hair conditioner and lotion. Honestly, I can't remember now if they had those or not. I think not. I will describe, though ,the setting of the courtyard/hotel because I'm not sure it's been done yet. From past pictures, I thought that the building was in a \"U' sape with the courtyard in the middle. Actually, the hotel is just one rectangular building and the buildings on each side in the back are separate businesses. One side was a villa/condo type of building and I can't remember the other side. Our balcony was on that second side and what we saw was the roof of that building to the right and the roof of another building beyond that. To our left, we could see the garden below and a glimpse of the condo type building. I also wanted to mention to the people who book rooms on the street. If you long for a balcony facing the quiet courtyard for those \"ah\" moments, I believe there was one at the end of one of the halls. It was not attached to any rooms. You may want to check with the hotel first (to make sure it is open to all) if this is an important part of your room decision. We slept great and noise was not a factor when we were there. We did have the air on when we slept but I don't remember the noise \"bothering \"us on our balcony earlier in the evening. Personally, I like to be in a cabin/lodge/tent in the western US, an inn/cottage/ b and b in New England, and anything \"adobe\" in the southwest. In other countries, I do my research to get my dose of local \"flavor\". Some of my choices are very ,very modest and some are on the indulgent side. We stayed at a funky, modest, beach hotel on this same trip to Playa. Next trip, we're going to one of Playa's thatched roof type of places.

It really doesn't get much better for the price. My boyfriend and I stayed in the Pandora room, which faces the street. My only warning would be that if you are a light or sensitive sleeper, you should probably make sure you book a room facing the garden, because there is some noise from the bar across the street (Bourbon Street) until about midnight and from people in general strolling down 5th Avenue. We did our homework and knew this going in, and since we're not light sleepers, it didn't bother us one bit. Just make sure to confirm what room you're in if that's the kind of thing that might bother you! Anyway, the rooms are spotless, updated and completely charming. Pandora doesn't have a fridge, which would be a nice touch, but it does have a small cable TV, a nice safe and air conditioning that works a lot better than my central air at home! The staff is a joy to deal with, everyone is cheerful and friendly. They provide a large bottle of water everyday, which is a lifesaver, trust me. The front desk staff speaks perfect English and really work hard to make your stay perfect. The hotel is in a great location. The beaches can get very crowded, especially at the beach clubs further North, but if you stay in the area between the ferry and Lunata, it's much more peaceful and you can even find some natural shade under the palm trees so you don't need to search up and down the beach in vain for a palapa. There doesn't seem to be a way to leave restaurant/bar reviews for PDC on this site, so I'll make some recommendations in this space. The first meal we had was the fish and shrimp tacos (fried) at Fusion Hotel just around the corner from Lunata and right on the beach. It was one of the best meals we had the entire week and we really liked the staff as well. I think our very favorite restaurant was La Fe, which is about a 10 minute slow walk from Lunata up on the northern end. Prices here are extremely reseasonable and everything we had the 3 times we ate there was outstanding. I highly recommend the shrimp burritos, fried potato tacos and the chicken wrapped with bacon. It has a really relaxed, hipster lounge feel to it as well. If you're looking for a great, cheap place on the beach for seafood, definitely try La Tarraya, not far at all from Lunata if you walk on the beach toward the south end of 5th ave. I loved their shrimp ceviche in an avocado. To be honest, you really cannot go wrong with shrimp anywhere in PDC, it seems to be one of the things most places do very well. Our favorite bar was Pez y Vela, a couple minutes walk from Lunata towards the south end of 5th. They have swing seats at the bar and the bartenders here were our favorites by far. It's really the kind of place you can go and hang out for hours on end. The patrons are extremely friendly (not sure why everyone we seemed to meet there was from Wisconsin, but we loved them!), the people watching is great and the bartenders are fast and very entertaining. I loved their frozen strawberry margaritas and the food was actually quite good. We loved the the queso fundido, which was very simple but so tasty. I know a lot of regular PDC-goers are big Tequila Barrel fans, but to us, this bar kicked its butt. I'll also recommend the YucaTrek tours we booked through playa.info. The Tulum tour was really cool, but I think if you do one tour, make it the Chichen Itza tour!", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "yardley, pa", "Title": "\u201cA Savior!\u201d", "Author": "dcanepa", "ReviewID": "UR14036757", "Content": "After a most unsatisfying one night at the Hotel Colibri, we walked over to Lunata and they couldn't have been more helpful to us.

The only problem was that Tortuga could only accommodate us for 3 days, but we were able to book at Lunata after that. At Lunata, our room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed with Mexican art. The staff was always very friendly and helpful to us. The garden patio is a beautiful oasis to get away from the busy 5th avenue. The breakfast needs some work, however.

It was lovely. The decor of the hotel is very tasteful and beautifully reflects Mexican arts. Inlaid pebbles in the floor, interesting art on the walls, etc. Whenever we lingered at the entry area, people walking down the street would wander in because they were so impressed and suprised by this little jewel in the middle of the busy 5th Ave. area. As an example of the craftsmanship, we asked the owner about the arched concrete that is used in many areas of the hotel. My husband who is an architect was sure it was cast that way, we wondered how they got the texture on it. The owner explained they brought in craftsmen from another area of Mexico, and it was all hand chiseled - and there was a lot of it. So if you enjoy authentic details, this hotel has many. Communicating with the staff was no problem. The manager and front desk staff could not have been more helpful. From restaurant suggestions, to where the locals shop for basic things like hair clips - every question answered with a smile. Our favorite restaurant for dinner was Ula Gula, just down the street a few blocks, on the corner, open air second floor dining room overlooking the street scene. Very romantic, great food, lovely. The hotel was spotless. Very clean, absolutely no problem there. The air conditioning was powerful, and cooled rooms quickly. It was very hot even in May, but you get into a different rhythm. For us we slept late, getting up just in time to eat the breakfast provided in the garden. (Very basic continental, but good - Mexican pastries, cereal, juice and coffee - sufficient.) Spent the hot day at the beach. The beach club they give a discount to is nice. Never a problem getting a chair or palupa. Reading, swimming, being served lunch or snacks (for reasonable price) at your beach chair - it doesn't get much better than that. Around 6 or 7 we went back to the hotel, showered and went out for dinner at about 8. By then it had cooled down. Other tips- for phones, go to nearest corner, turn toward beach to the internet shop. Cheaper long distance than phone cards. Day trips we did that were good - Tulum & Xcaret (sp?) in one day - fun. Xcaret was all food and drinks included. Take ferry to Cozumel one day. We went snorkeling, submarine (expensive, but worth it), and a bit of shopping. If you want souveniers that are more upscale, go to \"100% Mexico\" in the newer shopping area by the dock to Cozumel (you can walk), the sell nice things all made by Mexican craftsmen. Yes, it's a bit noisy, but didn't keep us up. At the price, I don't think you can find a nicer place.

When I travel, I want to know I am staying in another country, not waking up in a hotel that could be anywhere in the US. We decided on 6 nights PDC/Hotel Lunata and 3 nights splurging at the Hilton-Cancun in a villa. This was the perfect balance of experiences. The Lunata is the most gorgeous small hotel and a wonderful place to experience Mexico. Even my very american \"why-go-to-another-country\" husband loved it. You can't beat the location. Just step out of the door on to the pedestrian street of 5th Ave and everything is right there. The people in PDC are so welcoming and fun to be around. There are so many great restaurants on the Avenida that you will have a hard time trying to choose where to eat. The hotel, even though it is small, is lush and oozing with Mexican charm. The room's air conditioning held up great at all times even with 100% humidity almost every day. The employees were very helpful and we always felt safe. We slept in a king room on the street and only had a problem with noise on the first night (we were overly tired from travelling). It really wasn't bad enough to keep us up the other nights. We thought the king room was worth it for the wet bar and extra space but everyone should be aware that the \"balcony\" is really just a strip with a rail that is big enough to squeeze one chair sideways. The rooms with true balconies facing the garden were nice but we enjoy people watching so we wanted a street side room. The bathroom was better (and cooler looking!) than my bathroom at home. Lots of tile everywhere, plenty of towels, good sized fridge, fresh bottled water every day. We didn't have a car so parking wasn't an issue. Because it is in the middle of 5th Ave, if you need to meet a tour or take the ferry, everything is only a 10 minute walk away as opposed to being at one end or the other of the Avenida. As another reviewer said, when we were there, lots of people stopped in and oohed and ahhed at the entry way mentioning that they had wished they had known about the Lunata before they came.
