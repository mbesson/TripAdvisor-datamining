The person at the front desk did not offer to allow me to stay in the room I had until one was available and with my car blocked in I was stuck there. By the time I got my room it was too late for me to go to where I planned because of time. Then that night the room next to me had people screaming, kids yelling and doors slamming starting around 7pm. When I called the front desk after 10:30 pm they said they would talk to them. Then at 2:30am that same room was yelling and slamming doors. When I checked out the front desk did not seem to care nor acknowledge anything.

We went to Hollywood to get some costume wigs and outfits on Hollywood Blvd. I found this hotel after reading a suggestion by another trip advisor. This location is 170 steps from Hollywood Blvd! This is a no frills, super self service hotel. We arrived about 7 pm. The hotel is situated in a residential area and its a reasonably safe area. There was a few people outside smoking, as they have no smoking rooms at this location. When I walked in I was 3 rd in line. Got checked in quickly. We had to pay $10.00 for parking and that was not mentioned anywhere that I saw when I booked our reservations for 4 nights. Our room for Wednesday and Thursday was less than $70.00 each night. We had to park our car in the underground parking garage. Its a super tight fit. So if your in an SUV, forget it! We were told it was VALET, not so. Unless my understanding of VALET is wrong. Anyway we found a spot in the corner to park. *(See photos). We then got the luggage cart from the parking attendant who is not actually a VALET guy...loaded our stuff and took it to the elevator., We were assigned a room on the 4th floor. There is one elevator to service the 5 floor hotel and the garage. Plus a set of stairs. We were assigned room 425. It was the second to the last room on the floor. I was ok with this cuz then we did not get so much walk by noise. We opened the door and it is what it is. A very basic, clean room, no frills. We had asked for 2 queens but were given a king. I could deal with this. Not a huge issue. The bathroom is very basic. The water pressure in the shower and sink was really good. No matter what time of day we used them. Hot water came quickly. Linens are super white, clean and fresh in the bath. There is a basic set up but also a fridge which was nice as we brought water and used it for leftovers. Our window faced an apartment building. decent view, There was no liner or sheers, so if you opened the curtains, they were open to the view of the neighbors. The bedding is pretty basic, again no frills. There was an ironing board and iron in room. I had to go to the front desk for the blow drier and for shampoo. No conditioner is provided. The Ice Machine, Vending Machines, and Laundry are all located on the main floor only. That was good excercise for me as I am an Ice fanatic and have to have a lot of it , frequently. I was going up and down constantly for ice. But hey it beats having to buy bags of it. The TV had poor reception, but we were not here to watch TV. So again, another thing I could over look. So once we got settled, I took a nap, It was about 10 or so when we got up and out to Hollywood Blvd. It is seriously so close to the Blvd that it was the perfect place for us to stay. Also , since we were shopping at the best wig shop on the Blvd, we could walk to it too. There are several bars, clubs and places to eat in such close proximity. If you are a group of people or just a couple, this is a great location. I have to say this was so good for us as I sleep a lot, and anytime I needed a nap it was easy to go back to the room. This is such a convenient location. But if you are a pampered traveler, do not expect Ceasers treatment here. It is a basic room with a bed and shower. thats what you are getting here. Bring a candle or plug in air freshner with you if damp smell bothers you. And pack your sleeping mask if your sensitive to the light. A thermos that holds lots of ice is a good idea so your not running up and down all the time getting ice. Drive a small car or use a shuttle. * Currently doing remodeling on 5th floor, so you share the elevator with the workers, construction people as well as hotel staff.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOrdinary at best\u201d", "Author": "oztraveller74", "ReviewID": "UR119094831", "Content": "Whilst the location is good if you want to check out Hollywood there has to be better choices out there.

The location, however, is admittedly quite good. It's only a 5-10 minute walk to Hollywood Blvd where all the tourist attractions are housed. The Hollywood/Highland train station is also nearby as are various bus stops. As mentioned, the rooms are very basic. There's a bed, TV, drawers and a bathroom. We were given a room on the first floor and after looking out the window only to find the back alley staring back at us, it didn't feel so safe especially given the fact that our window wouldn't close all the way. The walls and doors are also paper thin; I could hear the cleaning lady rolling her cart down the hallway as though my door was open. People dropping or thumping on their floor above us could also be heard clearly. The beds were comfortable enough to sleep in though they were rather squeaky when one sat down on it. If you're sleeping alone, it's fine but when you're sharing a bed and you move, the squeaky sound does get rather tiring. There's no wi-fi in the room though there is a computer lounge with 3 computers that have internet access in the reception area. The hotel also has a coin operated laundromat and a common area with vending machines and a microwave. Overall, Motel 6 is a very basic hotel. I would only recommend it if you've a tight budget or you're not overly picky and a sound sleeper. The location to the various Hollywood attractions are a good incentive but the hotel's actual location did not feel quite so safe.

So why stay here? Location, location, location (and price). You're walking distance from all of the major Hollywood attractions, as well as decent bars and restaurants, not to mention subway stations and bus routes.

I contacted the hotel and asked them to send me the bag to my home address and I will pay for the delivery but they rudely declined. I tried to talk to them for a whole week and even talked but they just told me to turn to FedEx and do all the necessary arrangements by myself. So I did. The FedEx delivery guy had to come to the hotel twice and the staff only gave him the bag at the second time. With absolutely no help from the hotel staff I got the bag in my home address just to find out that all the jewelry was gone!!! (And only the make up was left in the bag).

They dont have safes at hotel, u can borrow hairdryers and irons - they just hold onto your ID. The neigbourhood was fine. The check in desk are helpful and can give directions, etc. if you get the chance go to a dodgers game - absolutely brilliant, great atmosphere, everyone was friendly and get u involved with the cheering and chanting, etc. Also try and get hold of tickets to jimmy kimmel, they're free and have some great guests and its opposite chinese theatre so close to hotel.

It's on Whitley, which is less than a half-block from Hollywood Boulevard. This is a famous street -- the Hollywood Walk of Fame is here, in addition to Kodak Theater and Mann's Chinese Theater. There is a lot of foot traffic on Hollywood Boulevard, locals as well as tourists, so it's great for people-watching. You can walk to restaurants and bars as well as stores like American Apparel, American Eagle Outfitters, two vintage clothing stores and souvenir shops. Mel's Drive In is literally right around the corner. I actually just got back from my stay. I went with my sister and her son. Getting past the location, which was excellent, the motel itself wasn't exactly wonderful. It looks good from the outside -- it's in a pretty nice area of Hollywood -- but it's a Motel 6. There are stains on the carpet in the hall and the elevator takes forever to arrive. But, the room was clean and adequate for our needs. For $10 a day you can park underground, and the attendant (wearing a white button-down shirt and vest) will bring you a wheeled luggage carrier. Best of all, they allow pets, which was my No. 1 priority. AND it's inexpensive. With the one night of lodging, pet fee ($10) and parking fee, it was $90. And you should know that's a steal in this area. If you're looking for a place to rest your head for a night or a weekend, I recommend Motel 6 Hollywood. If you're coming to LA and plan to spend a lot of time in the room on some kind of extended getaway, I'd look elsewhere.
