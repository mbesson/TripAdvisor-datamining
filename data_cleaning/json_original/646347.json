My grievances are below. 1) I'm used to tight spaces and even showers located in bedrooms, but if you're paying 110 euros a night for a room, then you should spruce up the accommodations a bit. Since the showers are located in the rooms and right next to the beds, the steam and condensation makes everything in the room very damp and cold -- despite the heaters. Every night, the sheets were so damp that I had to lay blankets I bought at the market on top of the bed to lay on. If you like breathing thick and damp air 24/7, then you won't have a problem. 2) The location of the hotel is great and the staff, at first, are very friendly, but if you're looking for a place for a longer stay with more flexible accommodations, then this is not your place. We let the owner know 3 days ahead of time that we were planning a trip outside of Istanbul and would like to cut our stay short. His friendly demeanor was dropped and he was incredibly unprofessional -- instead of being like the owner of a boutique hotel, he was unreasonable and told us to leave the hotel immediately. At first, I was very sympathetic with him, and we let him know that we would be willing to pay for the days that he was unable to book a room for, but he refused and demanded that ALL the money be paid. In fact, his cancellation policy is the most unreasonable I've ever come across, so be sure to read it carefully. Even if you cancel 30 days ahead of time, you are expected to pay 25% of the total price. 3) He demands that cash be paid up-front and in full. While this is understandable on the surface, he is not a licensed hotel and therefore you have no rights as a patron. If something goes wrong, he does not have to give you a refund for dissatisfaction. He does not advertise this on his website and I'm sure we were not the first to be surprised that we would need to extract over a thousand dollars in cash and pay him -- with no way to get a refund. 4) We booked our stay of nine days online, thinking that the increased room rate over New Years would decrease after New Year's. Instead, the rate conveniently dropped on January 7th -- the last day of our stay. 5) The \"common\" area is not a \"common\" area at all -- it is locked during the day and night. The same is true with the kitchen. There is no area to sit and relax besides your own room. I recommend the Buyuk Londra for a nice stay. While many have complained the unrenovated rooms are musty, they were not damp and the service is unbeatable.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIt's name says it all\u201d", "Author": "leomarmag", "ReviewID": "UR81145562", "Content": "I'm on a new kick of staying at more and more guest houses and bnb's for the personal touch and character.

So if you don't expect too much, you will find this to be a charming, well run, very clean and friendly guest house. With some quirky room decors. We stayed in two rooms; one of the cheaper rooms (only one available that night) and in the Black room. There really is a vast difference between the cheaper rooms where the shower and basin are \"stuck\" in the corner of the room, and the more expensive rooms, with much better bathrooms. So aim for the Sultan, Zen, Black or Red rooms, and I'd avoid the Colonial, Retro, Leylak and Hamman rooms. The staff at Eklektik are extremely helpful and friendly. They man the reception 24 hours and are always willing to lend a hand. Their desire to please would definitely be a highlight of the place. The building is tucked away in a small side street but very handy to the Tunel end of \u00c4\u00b0stiklal Cd in Beyoglu so you can walk to Taksim Square, use the funicular to go down the hill and generally walk anywhere you need to go. The building is old and compact so you do hear a lot of internal noise at night, especially from the squeaky old staircase so don't stay here if you are a light sleeper. Or go for the Red room as it's at the top of the stairs so others don't pass by. We also stayed at the Lush Hotel at Taksim Square, which I booked via an internet site for about 35 euro a night more.

First of all, by talking to the owner, we discovered it is not a real guesthouse. They do not have a legal license for that type of business so they rent the 8 rooms with a short term contract; therefore you are technically subletting the room as a roommate, with all the legal implications. They run the place as a guesthouse, with a breakfast in a very small dining room, but unlike guesthouses you need to ask the few people working there to give you anything from the refrigerator. Their policy is that you pay upfront the whole amount and no cancellation is aloud. That means that, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the place and want to move out, you do not get your money back. Technically you should be able to use your room for all the days you paid, but we found out it was not exactly so. My partner fell in one of the very steep streets that you need to walk in order to reach the Eklektik. In the guesthouse there is no elevator and we had to walk 5 flights of narrow and old stairs to go to our room. We decided to move out because my partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knee was hurting. As a favor, the owner assured us that if he could rent our room he would have reimbursed us. 3 days later I stopped by to pick up 2 books and some money that we had forgotten in the room that technically was still ours, and found out that it was already occupied for 3 days. They refused to reimburse me regardless, while they kept my money plus the new tenant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I could call the police and possibly ruin someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vacation if I wanted to have my room back, but I never did that because I did not want to ruin my vacation in the first place. During our stay another couple moved out and I believe they were not reimbursed. They were rightly complaining about the lack of the Bosporus view that they claim to have. I strongly recommend anyone visiting Istanbul to avoid this place. At first it may look nice, but you may end up in a bad situation had they sold your room to someone else previously. Or in case you are not happy with the place. The area is full of equally nice small hotels that probably have a legitimate license and a lower price.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCompact and bijou with a good breakfast\u201d", "Author": "TravelPad", "ReviewID": "UR65399802", "Content": "Like the title of the article suggests, this guesthouse might not be the most spacious, but it is certainly a very friendly place and the staff really do make you feel very welcome. For me though, the best part of the stay was the breakfast. This is taken around the same large dining table downstairs and guests sit round this together unless of course you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a late riser. And this is another plus point, there is great flexibility with regard to when you have the breakfast which makes the stay just that bit more relaxing. We even had breakfast approaching midday. The breakfast has a huge selection of cheeses, breads, olives, juice, tea, coffee, cakes biscuits, fruit which don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to run out no matter how much of it you eat. So you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in no danger of setting out to see Istanbul with an empty stomach. The rooms themselves are quite compact but are tastefully decorated and have everything you need. They also have a safe in them for your valuables, a TV and free Wi-Fi throughout which can be quite useful. They are bright rooms with large sash window and each has its own particular name and theme. Another good thing about this guesthouse is the location. Whilst we were there, work was being carried out on the street outside to improve the look of the street. I would imagine that this would bring more people to the area as some of the shops around here do look quite expensive. There is also the main shopping drag around the corner and the side streets off them really do come to life at night. I would say that this is the one of the busiest places I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to for bars and restaurants as there are hundreds. However, drinking in Istanbul isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly cheap. Coming from London this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem so bad, but I thought it would be much cheaper, even local wine in cafe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bars and restaurants is on average about \u00c2\u00a325 a bottle. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a lively interesting restaurant with roof top views over Istanbul, then you could try the 360 restaurant. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t easy to find as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the top of a ordinary looking office block that you have to take a lift to, but I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth the visit for good food and fine wine.

Very close by the Tunel in Beyoglu and all the fantastic back street bars and restaurants, about five mins walk from Galata tower, 30-45 mins spectacular walk over the bridge to Sultanamehmet (and you can pick up one of the delicious fried fish sandwiches as you step onto the Golden Horn, yum). Be warned that it's a little bit obscure to find - on a tiny alley off Serdar-i Ekram Cd, near the junction with Sah Kulu Bostan Sk. If you're directing a transfer, it's probably best to tell them to go up Serdar as car access is usually denied from Istikal Cd/ Tunel end. Cleanliness:- Generally very clean - although when we lost something under the bed, there was a ton of dust! Towels were replaced, bedding was spotless. Quietness/Privacy:- Our room was overlooked by the German school opposite - keep your curtains closed or you may have someone peeping in! Generally a quiet place, you can hear other people moving around (it's a small guest house) but nothing not copable with. There's no loud bars nearby - it's a residential area. Facilities:- truly, truly amazing breakfast, with a huge plus point that you can have it whenever you get up rather than being limited to a particular time period. This made the whole experience very laid back, and there was always tons of stuff for us by 11.30 am. Fruit, tomatoes and cucumber, lots of different types of jam, honey, olives, breads, cake, gorgeous coffee, tea, fruit juice - and other stuff on demand. Very friendly people around to help with breakfast - good for an interesting natter, but also able to discreetly keep out of your way if you're feeling a bit worse for wear! Style:- a boutique guest house, so all the rooms are different. Ours was the Sultan room. Beautifully laid out with opulent textiles, lovey mirror, big old wardrobe and an in-room hamman-style shower with marble and an ottoman lamp overhead. Very beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable. The place as a whole is a laid-back and friendly guest house - and you do feel like you're a guest in someone's house. Service:- All the people working there were friendly and interesting, always up for suggestions and chats - no problems with English at all. We felt we were made very, very welcome. Help with our bags, lots of advice, and fantastic help with our transfer pick up back to the airport, who had problems finding the place (see above on location for further help here!).

Joining the guests at the breakfast table were the owner and his partner who live relatively nearby and the young manager (the flirtaious and endlessly helpful Selcuk) when he came on duty. (On the subject of breakfast, the constantly replenished table included eggs, cheeses, olives, cucumber, tomatoes, fruit (stawberries that taste like strawberries) fresh bread, simit (enjoy), sweet butter, honey soaked jams, thick cream (Clotted?) floating in honey, cake, Turkish Delight(!), grilled cheese and tomato slices, tea, coffee, and juice, and things I have probably forgotten. The only thing missing was yoghurt and when I think of it, had I asked they probably would have served it to me the next day.

I should also mention how pleasant, helpful, friendly and attentive all the young staff were. Although only a small establishment, the rooms are spacious (and mine was one of the smaller rooms I think) and well appointed. The location - truly only minutes from the unending pleasures of Beyolgu - is unbeatable, yet still quiet (if you ignore the occassional dog barking, chicken clucking, and cats noisely mating). For those who, like me, enjoy walking, almost everything you might want to see in the historic parts of Istanbul can be reached on foot.
