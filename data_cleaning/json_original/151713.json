Loved it so much that we have had a REALLY hard time adjusting to home again and we can't wait to come back soon. As far as the Embassy Suites: Pros:1. The room is a suite. Anyone with small children knows this is important. We could put the kids down for bed or nap and still be in our living room talking and that was great. 2. They serve free breakfast every morning and than we only needed a small lunch or snack before dinner. 3. They have a managers reception at night with snacks, juices, pop, and drinks. We stopped here every night before we left the hotel for dinner. It was a great before dinner appetizer that helped hold all of us over before our later dinner. 4. The beach was beautiful during the week. The Embassy Suites section was nice and it was great to have chairs, towels and umbrellas at the beach. 5. The pool, although crowded, was nice and perfect for the kids to play in for hours while I could read a book. Cons: 1. It's not that clean people. We have traveled to a lot of Embassy Suites and this one is by far the dirtiest one we've stayed at. At first glance the rooms look clean, but then you start looking in the corners, at the carpet, under any furniture, closer at the fixtures in the bathroom and you can tell that these rooms haven't been deep cleaned in a LONG time. Gross 2. One the weekend it was crazy crowded. We had to wait 20 minutes in the breakfast line, and same for managers reception. It was hard to find seats and could barely find anywhere around the pool. That thing that was the worst was the cleanliness at the meals during the busy weekend. For example, the bacon tray had more bacon hanging outside on the counter than in the actual tray. I looked at my husband and said is that supposed to be decoration or something? It was gross and wouldn't pass food codes for sure. I understand that they are busy on the weekends but then that shouldn't surprise them, and they should bring in more staff to handle the bigger crowds. 3. The front desk staff were not great. They were friendly, but always talking to other co-workers and I felt bad interrupting them. I would go down there and ask for towels to be delivered to the room, it never happened. 4. We pre-paid for our trip on the embassy website and it said it covers all taxes and fees. They racked on more than $300 worth of taxes before we checked out. I went to the counter and showed them my receipts and they weren't willing to budge at all. So frustrating when you prepay for things. If they have a \"special tax\" then they should add that in when you prepay. Overall we again LOVED PR, an amazing island with great culture and even better Puerto Rican food. I highly recommend going to see El Morro fort, the El Yunque rain forest, going to Luquillo beach and check out all the food stands, and our favorite going to Old San Juan and spend the day there. As for the Embassy Suites, I wouldn't be that excited to stay there again. It worked for us mainly because we were traveling with small children but I would not be that excited to stay there again. Honestly I would stay somewhere closer to Old San Juan...", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel BUT Beware of Add'l Hotel FEES\u201d", "Author": "puyallupgirl", "ReviewID": "UR128231215", "Content": "We were there from 4/6 - 4/13. We were looking for a nice hotel that was still family friendly and close to the beach. Also to be honest, the fact that the Embassy Suites offers a full breakfast was a huge draw for us as we were traveling with two children. We looked at other hotels that were comparable in price. At the time the much-glitzier El San Juan was not that much more a night, but we knew that breakfast for four in PR could easily be $40- $50 a day (unless you go to Burger King, and that's not really not our style), therefore we went with Embassy Suites. The location is great, right off the freeway, which worked for us because we did a lot of sightseeing outside of the Isla Verde area. The hotel itself was nice, the pool area was somewhat small but very kid-friendly. The rooms were very spacious and large, they can stand to be updated, but they were fine. The breakfast was great. Since we were there during Easter we went to Easter Brunch at the Hilton Caribe and spent $27 per person on a breakfast buffet that I swear was only slightly better than the breakfast at the Embassy Suites! Lesson learned! The Embassy Suites offers a great Managers Reception every night, which offers free cocktails and light snack foods, and there are soft drinks for the kiddos. The casino was a nice added bonus, I think we played down there one evening and there were a lot of slots and great live music. Drawbacks: Check-in time is LATE and there is no early check-in. I will give them the benefit of the doubt becasue we arrived on a very busy weekend (tail end of Puerto Rican springbreak), but they were not flexible on checking in early and I wasn't able to get my room until 4:30 and we had been in town since noon. We were exhausted and had to sit in the lobby with all our suitcases after flying 11 hours from Seattle. The restaurants at the hotel are no bueno. I mean who wants to eat at Outback when you are in Puerto Rico?? Maybe some American tourists consider that fun to eat at a sub-par Austrailian chain restaurant when you are on vacation on a beautiful, tropical carribean island, but that is not my idea of fun AT ALL. There is another small restaurant/bar on location called El Patio. Do not go there. My Dad was visiting our hotel one night and ordered an order of Nachos - to his disturbed surprise they were made with Cheez Wiz and they were not cheap. Drinks here are also VERY pricey for watered-down small drinks (tiny, watered-down Margarita was like $9, during happy hour it's like $5, not worth it, just get the free drinks at the managers reception). The only other drawback is that it is not on the beach, next time we go we will probably try to be on the beach. But the fact that Embassy Suites has a section of the beach reserved where you can get lounge chairs and umbrellas went a long way towards making up for it. It's not a far walk at all and it worked out very well for us. BEWARE of additional hotel fees. When we checked out there were an additional $400 in hotel fees tacked onto our bill!!! Next time we will be sure to verify any fees prior to reserving. I don't know if this is common practice in PR or for Embassy Suites or what - but this was highly disturbing. So that reasonable nightly rate may not be so reasonable after all. Parking is also $16/day, but we were aware of that before we got there. Overall we would come back here again, especially with the kiddos, it was a very family-friendly hotel, we will just be sure to verify any fees in advance.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cHusband doesn't like to Travel but...\u201d", "Author": "Adam M", "ReviewID": "UR128127845", "Content": "I was on egg shells about traveling to a new hotel with the husband and 16 year old who are homebodies.

We had a 2 bd/2 bth/1 king/ 2 dbl/ 14% resort fee suite. When we arrived the outside staff was very pleasant but it went down hill quickly. I walked up to the front desk and the woman (unfortunately I can't remember her name, she was so personable) didn't even look up from her computer. She said continuing to look down and said \"Yes\". I told her that we were checking in and she said our room wasn't ready yet. This was about 2:00. She said come back at 3:00. So we just walked around. We couldn't go out to the pool area because you needed a key to get out and in. We decided to eat so we ate at the hotel bar area. There was 2 other tables with 2 each and it took awhile to even get menus. 1 person was working the restaurant and bar area. We ordered 4 appetizers and drinks. After 45 minutes of waiting for apps I asked if they we coming out soon. She said, I'll check. She brought out 3 and forgot 1. I asked about the Fried Raviolis and she said \"Oh we are out of those\". Whatever. At 3:00 I went back to the desk and the talked to miss nice and she said that our room still wasn't ready yet. Even though keys for other rooms were being handed out left and right. She said come back at 3:30. We once again went and sat waiting. Luckily there are sitting areas in the lobby to wait. Went back at 3:30 and 1 of our rooms were ready. She gave me the key and I asked her to check on the adjoining room. And surprise it was ready. She proceeded to hand me a form to initial and sign for the 14% resort fee and a $50.00 a night incidentals fee and asked for my credit card. I told her that the rate that I paid online included the 14% resort fee. It turned very ugly from there. She said it did not include it so I showed her my paperwork proving it. She took the paper and turned the page and said here it is. Not included. I asked her to show me where it was printed and she kept saying it was in there. She could never show me where it was. I wasn't signing the form and needed to speak to a manager. Another surprise, she wasn't available. She finally showed up and said that it wasn't included in my rate (which it was) and she wanted to make me happy so she would wave it. ($90.00). Which was interesting since I had already paid it. We went up to our room and it was fine for what we needed. We got alittle settled, went down to the pool and then dinner at the Outback. Just like any other. The buffet breakfast the next day was ok. Walked over to the Walgrens and then onto the beach for awhile. Like others have said, there is an area for free chairs, umbrellas and towels. Nice guy working this area. Then, back to the hotel and took a taxi into to Old San Juan ($23 for 6 people). Walked around and had dinner at Cafe San Juan. On the way back another guy tried to charge us $30 but I said that it was $23 coming so how could it be $30 going back. We gave him $25. The next day was checkout. After reading many Trip Advisor reviews (thank you very much) about this hotel with fraudulent issues on that charge cards I decided to go online to my discover account while sitting at the breakfast table. OMG. The hotel had charged us $49.00 a day for the resort fee, $100.00 for incidentals and $267.00 for something that was unexplainable. I walked up to the front desk to speak to a manager. Melvin said \"don't worry about the charges they are just on hold\". What are they for, Melvin. Melvin needs a course in people skills. Of course, there was no manager around so I said find one. 30 minutes someone would be here. I went back to the table and brought up my account again and everything was in the authorization mode. I called Discover and explained that I paid for my room in advance back in January. There should be no charges from this hotel at all for anything. She transfered me to the Security/Fraud unit. I talked to them and explained the situation. She asked if I was still on the premises and I said yes. I walked back up to the desk and Jose was finally there. I told him that he needed to bring up the charges on the computer and he kept saying \"don't worry\". I asked what the $267 was for and he just kep saying I don't know. WHAT. I then proceeded to tell him that I was on the phone with the Discover fraud unit and they wanted to speak with him. PRICELESS moment. I quess not many people bring up there credit card accounts while at a hotel. He was told that all the fraudelent charges had gone thru to authorization and they needed to be taken off. While talking to Discover on my cell phone he proceeded to hand me 2 cheap Embassy suites tee shirts and 2 cheap zipper travel bags (which 1 zipper broke the first day). CHECK CHECK CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS IF YOU CAN BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS HOTEL. Watch what you sign and if you know that your rate included the 14% resort fee which is really crazy anyway, don't initial the box on the paperwork they give you when you checkin. If I hadn't checked my accounts we would have had over $400.00 in charges that were not legal charges when we got home. Will never stay here again! Rooms were nice and were fine for what we needed. From from the minute we walked into this hotel the front desk staff and bar staff were rude and unfriendly. They really should take a class in people skills. If you don't like dealing with the public then get another job. But from the second they get you in they have you. Especially if you pay in advance with a non-refunable rate like we had. They can treat you however they want which is what happened. Can't wait for the manager response on this one.

Hotel is in a good location (close to airport and cruise terminal) but there is no shuttle bus to either, meaning $20+ taxi rides are compulsory with many drivers adding extra charges for large parties and baggage. Our room was described as a 2 bedroom suite, but was actually a living area with sofa bed and a bedroom with two small double beds. Having a party of 5, a 2 bedroom suite would have been more than suitable, but the doubles weren't big enough for two people to sleep comfortably meaning 2 of us were made to sleep on the VERY uncomfortable sofa bed (so uncomfortable in fact that we ended up taking the cushions off the sofa's and sleeping on them on the floor for 3 nights, something you don't want after 23 hours of travelling.) There were not enough towels, cups, tea/coffee or pillows and it took three calls and a visit to reception for them to provide us with these. When we asked about the beds we were told that we would not receive help due to booking through HOTELS.COM. The bathroom has no natural light so is very dark due to the lack of artificial lighting also. Our room was 623 opposite the elevators, something that made it noisy at night. Can't complain about breakfast, acceptable especially seen as it was free! There was plenty of loungers at the pool but the pool itself was dirty and cold. Laundry facilities were good. Don't recommend the Outback Steakhouse. Our server was rude and incompetent and lost our debit card! She was never around to assist us and the food was very disappointing.

While it wasn't the worst, it wasn't the best. Customer service was good, but upon entering the room, there was an instant musty smell. Like all Embassy Suite's, the bathroom has no adequate exhaust ventilation so after taking a shower, the moisture in the air has nowhere to go, but make the entire room feel damp. This is a design flaw in every Embassy Suite hotel I have stayed. It just is a bit worse here since we are so close to the beach. Breakfast was great and there is a nice bar and modest casino for gamblers. I don't gamble, so I wasn't able to make an opinion one way or the other. There is an Outback Steakhouse here. I was initially very excited, but the food was lousy. I ordered a petit fillet mignon with mushroom sauce. My steak was undercooked and the cut of meat was very stringy with tendon material--it wasn't a grocery store quality cut of meat--very disappointing. I also ordered a Caesar salad and the shredded parmesan cheese tasted and felt like it was from the heel of the block of cheese. There was no salty flavor--it felt like plastic. The steamed vegetables were sad as well. The steamed baby carrots on my plate weren't cooked and tasted like they came from a bag. Oh yea, one more thing. The service was third-string at best. I had my salad at my table, but it took 10 minutes to get the attention of someone to get a fork. It wasn't until my main plate came that someone was available to get a set of forks and a knife.

The casino was open, and there was live music, giving the lobby a festive, but not overly loud, atmosphere.

The coffee was outstanding, strong and tasty! Then in the evening you also get two (2) hours of happy hour also included in the price!! Our houskeeping lady, Vidalina Mercedes was wonderful. Beautiful personality, efficient, detailed worker. During breakfast I could not help noticing Ivette, she maintained the coffe counter spotless, picked up tables, offered to help people that needed help and was all over the place working hard and with a beautiful smile and disposition. Also, @ breakfast Rene, Nilda and Juan Vazquez walked the extra mile!!! The are all quick and efficient! We spoke to the senior Food & Beverage Manager to congratulate him and his staff because good employees are a reflection of great management. The beautiful pool area, bar area, Outback Rest were also great. And last but not least the employee at the beach on 2/21 was very accomodating and helpful.

The hotel is a stone's throw from the airport and the Isla Verde beach, plus is a short walk from the bus stop that can take you into Old San Juan for just a few pennies. If you are a senior the fare is only 35 cents. There are several little inexpensive restaurants a block away and the hotel also has several in-house dining venues, including an Outback. The complimentary and very substantial breakfast features cook to order eggs and all the typical breakfast sides, including fruit, potatoes, french toast and pancakes, plus other breads and pastries. Rooms are large, especially the living area. There are large flat screen TV's in both the living area and the bedroom. The bed was very comfortable, but had a rather heavy duvet with comfortor inside, so we kept the AC on to stay comfortable, as there were no light blankets available. There is a little glass topped dressing table in the bedroom in addition to a large dresser and two side tables. There is an in room safe that they charge $35 for the key until you return it on leaving. The $35 was still on our credit card bill this morning here in California, two days since our return. We were on the \"Hilton Honors\" floor, #7, so had a nice view of the city. The pool is huge, but is more like a lagoon, so not great for lap swimming. The grounds surrounding the pool are lovely and make a nice, relaxing place to have a drink and appetizers. The evening happy hour, which runs from 5:30 to 7:30pm offers two free drinks (wine is terrible, so stick to bar drinks or the pre-mixed rum punch or margaritas), chips and salsa plus popcorn. The interior is a little dark, but is very tropical feeling, as there are real palm trees and plants surrounding a nice size pond built with rocks and a little waterfall. This hotel would be a nice place for families, as the kids really seemed to enjoy the pool area. The hotel gives you towels for the beach and offers seating there as well. All in all, a nice place to relax and enjoy the beauty of San Juan and all that Old San Juan has to offer, as it is easily accessed via an inexpensive rus ride. Be sure to savor some mofongu while in Puerto Rico, plus order the escargot there, as it is the best I have ever eaten.

It was FREEZING, like an ice bath. Basically, it was unusable. Very few people were going in because it was so damn cold. The rest of the hotel wasn't bad but, again, wasn't great. The breakfast and evening reception were good, and the room was OK if not dated. The in-room safe was an absolute nightmare, by the way. It was old and key-operated, not digital, and it was broken when I arrived. When I called the front desk the first time, the woman said she'd send someone up right away. About a half hour, 45 minutes later, I called again and she said the same thing -- someone would be right up. About another 45 minutes later, I called again and got the same response, only this time, they finally showed up. That it took three calls was an absolute disgrace, no excuses.

The staff at the front desk as well as the housekeeping staff go out of their way to make your stay comfortable and welcoming. They are all very friendly and accomodating. This hotel could be so much more with just a few major changes. All the rooms are worn, tired, and dirty. Housekeeping does all it can to keep it looking good, but carpeting is worn and dirty, bathrooms have no ventilation at all and end up steamy and dim. Why you would not have an exhaust fan in a bathroom is beyond me, with some bright lights to put make up on? The extra space for the suite is so nice to have, but if you want anyone at all to sleep on the pull out couch, you need to make it a comfortable bed! You really could not sleep on that couch unless you were a child. There are very nice futons out there now with a wonderful sleeping mattress that is not a bunch of springs. TV's were flat screen and a nice improvement, but the carpeting! Come on Embassy. As far as the food goes, the breakfast buffet was very nice and very welcoming in the morning. The manager's reception in the evening was also very nice. The food in the Patio area near the casino was terrible! We ordered something to bring out to the pool and when we opened our boxes, we almost laughed, but we needed food, soooo. The tropical salad was nothing less than a dinner salad with a few grapes in it. The nacho grande was nothing more than the chips served the night before at the manager's reception and some cheese whiz. The Italian Panini was so tough, you could harldy bite the sandwich. I don't know, but it cost me $40.00 and wasn't worth $10. Also the pool area is soooo pretty, and inviting, but don't go in the water. It is the coldest pool I have ever stepped foot in.

However some of thr group did not get a hot breakfast due to no eggs/bacon or even sausage? Why did it run out and more so why was there only on cook for the cooking station. Pool was nice with great views of landing aircraft. Pool bar did not open on time ( they claimed it was lack of ice). The menu shown was not available so we were very limited to what could be had. However on renetring the hotel found all the menu available at the shop , so why were we not told by the bar staff. Evening reception was good value, as it was Included, and if you asked there was a wide range of drinks to be had. popcorn and salsa to nibble on. Went to the Steak house and got a table booked for eight, Whilst waiting there were various nibbles and so on offered. Got to table and it was laid for 6, short wait whilst they sorted that out. Gave order for eight and three meals arrived.Confusion as to what to do , wait or shout. Waitress came along and relaised we had not got all the meals. Still took 25 mins to sort so party had a disjointed meal . Sad really as food , for me , was good. However some of the others found it not so good and cold.Complaints seem to be ridden over, so no tip there and really it was not the fault of the waitress, so far as we could see. Next morning , again breakfast was fine for me but other party members had no hot food at all. Really does need to be sorted , if it is included then it needs to be there.

The suite was clean and roomy. There were a couple of minor issues with it. First, there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom and after any shower or bath, the whole suite got a bit steamy. Second, there was no towel bar or rack so trying to dry a towel for later reuse was impossible when hanging it on the door hook, given the general humidity in the bathroom from the lack of exhaust fan. As for amenities, there's an Outback Steakhouse which is like every other Outback Steakhouse. The service was very good, even though we came in for a full dinner about 15 minutes before closing. The breakfast buffet has \"cook to order\" eggs and you can even get an egg white omelet with your choice of fillings. The other items on the buffet were all good. Go early, though. Around 9am you might be looking for an empty table and also at a good 45 minutes from start to finish. There's a casino in the hotel lobby. They have many slot machines, two roulette wheels and three blackjack tables. The dealers, for the most part, were nice. Some, however, almost seemed to be on the side of the house. For example, they were never apologetic for taking six cards and making a 21 to beat your 20. Every other casino I've been to the dealers seem to want you to win and it just didn't feel that way there. No big deal, though. I still managed to pull a couple hundred dollars from the blackjack tables during my stay. The casino has only been opened for a few months, so maybe they'll iron out any kinks. Also, everything requires approval from the pit boss. Asking the dealer to change a $5 chip into singles for a \"propina\" has to be approved by the pit boss and can take a couple of minutes. Like I said, though, maybe just growing pains. Lastly, Dragonfly Adventures has a kiosk in the lobby to book your excursions and tours. The tours themselves were great, but the information we got from Dragonfly prior to going was horrible. We did the El Yunque trip and the bioluminescent bay kayak trip. First, the El Yunque trip had a spot where you could wade under a waterfall. Obviously, you were going to get soaking wet. Nothing was mentioned about this at the Dragonfly desk and we felt left out when everyone was splashing around in bathing suits they were apparently informed to bring along and having a good time while we stood there without a change of clothes watching them. Second, the we were told on the kayak trip we might get splashed a little. I've kayaked before both with and without a skirt in a river kayak and generally you do only get splashed a little. These kayaks, however, were open top ocean kayaks. I don't have a problem at all with getting wet kayaking. And in fact, there were shower facilities at the take-out point for the explicit purpose of washing off the salt water and putting on some dry clothes. My problem was that Dragonfly made no mention of this at all and we had to ride 90 minutes back to the Embassy Suites with \"dinghy butt\". The final thing is not a knock on Dragonfly at all, but most of the fun stuff is east of the Embassy Suites, so you are first on the van and last one off and you spend as much as or more time driving compared to the actual excursion. You do get to experience more of the fabulous Puerto Rican drivers than the other guests, though. (If you've never been, they are all crazy.) If I go back to Puerto Rico, I'd consider staying here again although two free nights from HHonors was a big factor. Dragonfly does some nice trips, but I will always bring a bathing suit and a change of dry clothes wherever we go - even on the Bacardi tour :)", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warner Robins GA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent business stay\u201d", "Author": "Bobbareeno", "ReviewID": "UR124352860", "Content": "I stayed here for ten nights total while on business in San Juan.

It looked dated. Service at the pool / snack bar was extremely slow. I placed an order for an appetizer and some drinks and it took over 45 minutes to get it. Overall, we had a great time in Puerto Rico. We are not extremely picky travelers. As long as the room was clean and the service was half way decent, we were fine with everything. The pool area and casino were nice. The area that the hotel was in seemed safe. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to San Juan and needs a large room on a budget.

As another reviewer mentioned, there is no hotel shuttle (there don't actually seem to be such things for any of the properties), and a taxi will cost around $12-15. Parking at the hotel is chaotic--there was never a problem getting a space, but it seemed like we were constantly behind drivers who couldn't work the gate and then insisted on going the wrong way upon entering the garage (it wasn't just us -- we noticed the garage staff seemed a bit bewildered by this behavior, too). Parking, at $16 a day for self park, is less than I've paid at other hotels in the area. I stayed there with my parents between Christmas and New Year's, at the height of the busy season. The hotel was a bit overrun with college swimming teams in town for winter break training, and the fact that the hotel was bursting at the seams showed quite a bit: the line at breakfast and at the manager's reception / happy hour in the afternoon were both incredibly long (forty five minutes for the latter). The first day we were there, the staff seemed to be overwhelmed; by the time we left, systems seemed to be in place to deal with the madness. The hotel is not on the beach - the beach is about a ten minute walk away up a side street. There is a section of Isla Verde beach reserved for guests at the Embassy Suites (look for the flag), where a staff member will provide you with beach chair, towel, and umbrella. Restaurants in the hotel are a bit pricey--we ate at the bar the first night because we arrived late, and the prices were on par with a restaurant in Old San Juan, even if the service and quality was not. There's an Outback Steakhouse in the hotel, which is one of the most expensive places in Isla Verde to eat -- ask at the front desk (not at the concierge stand -- the concierge is a private company) for recommendations for local restaurants within walking distance.

When I checked in at the hotel, I advised the agent my 2 friends would not be staying and since it was just me, could the rate be adjusted to the single rate of $179. His reply was \"you have the best rate for the night\". However, in talking to another hotel employee, the hotel was only 1/4 full! It is a basic Embassy design with a great atrium, evening reception and breakfast. I did not arrive for the reception, but the breakfast was disappointing. All of the hot food was cold, the toaster's were not working, but the coffee was good. There is a lobby restaurant serving \"local\" cuisine (go out and get better food at a cheaper price). And there is an Outback Steakhouse that is attached, a great pool area and a very small casino. And because of the casino, your bill is smacked with a resort fee.

It did include custom-order omelets and pancakes. Was a little chaotic and not replenished that well. Included Happy Hour is a nice touch, with a few drinks, popcorn, chips/salsa.

Having the \"line-up\" really made it un-personal and undesirable having to stand in line for drinks. Any other Embassy I have been to had a regular bar with many bartenders on staff for the occasion so there was very little waiting. Also b) for breakfast, again the lines were really long too. Maybe having 2 lines for buffet food and then just 1 station for omelettes would be better. the breakfast was great though! I did like how the pool area always a security guard walking around - that made me feel comfortable and knowing that my items were safe, should I decide to get in the water and leave my belongings.

And it's all you can eat, so I was very happy with this!! I can't say enough about this, it is SO worth it. -Convience..Embassy has everything you need inside the hotel. There is a casino with a lounge and live band and singers every night. I really enjoyed the band as I'm not so much of a gambler. They have an Outback restaurant inside the hotel, a pizza place AND the hotel restaurant (el Patio), which serves good drinks and good food..try the churrasco. It's a little pricey (21-30 dollars) but if you want to stay in the hotel and still enjoy a good meal, this is a good option. They also have internet kiosk, which came in handy to pay some bills and check my facebook and bank balance. They have plenty of lounge chairs and couches if you just want to hang out. The hotel is also very close to the beach, although I have to say its not the two blocks everyone says it is. It's more like 6, but the walk is straight down the street and it seemed safe and nice. There are also fast food joints..(Wendy's etc) and spanish restaurants close by (Ponderosa and Mi Casita). I went to Ponderosa and it was NOT worth the money..the food and ambiance were mediocre at best. Although I never did it, I hear you can catch the bus right across the street, or you can catch a cab right outside the hotel. Please make sure you negotiate a price before getting inside. They also have a price menu to your right that shows the price for a trip to the mall, or Old San Juan..so look at this first because they will try to rip you off (it happened to me). Room-My room was nice. Although I could tell it was a little dated, it was comfy and clean. Concierge-Shout out to Lena!!!! She was so nice and accomodating. She really made me feel welcomed! Thanks for booking my tour to OSJ for me, I had a great time!! BAD- HouseKeeping-My room was not cleaned unless I called the front desk. Friday I called to say my room was not cleaned yet, and the young man told me the staff has until 5pm. ARE YOU SERIOUS??!! I've never heard of that before! So he sends someone up and she half way cleans up. She DOES NOT CHANGE MY SHEETS. She just makes up the bed, throws some trash away and wipes down the bathroom and tables. Saturday afternoon I came back from my tour at 4:30pm and my room was the way I left it....AGAIN! Again I call the front desk and the lady tells me that the staff leaves at 5pm. Well that doesnt mean that they can wait until the end of the shift to clean!! I really think that if I didnt call they wouldnt have come at all! And here is the kicker..............the housekeeping cart was left outside my room..308..EVERYDAY!! Just ridiculous. I bought this to the attention of the front desk (Illeana) and she comped me for the 14% fee. That was good, but I would rather have had my room cleaned. Charges- My room was paid in advance, so when I got there, I was supposed to pay a deposit, $50 a night (3 nights) and any extra charges, ie room service. I had room serivice $31 dollars and $50 for the Old San Juan tour, so my charges should have been about $80. I had all types of erroneous charges from Embassy Suites once I checked my account balance! Thanks to the staff for correcting this quickly, but please get it together!! Even with the bad stuff, this was an AWESOME first trip to Puerto Rico. I loved the hotel, it was very lively at all times of the day. I loved the tour of Old San Juan! Please do the tour, you will love the history, architecture, shopping and food. And to all those who may want to travel alone like I did, no worries! You will meet new friends like I did on the tour or in the hotel.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel...\u201d", "Author": "nadia2923", "ReviewID": "UR119517909", "Content": "The hotel is very clean and the staff are very nice.

I like Puerto Ricans, friendly, made a bunch of friends in pool, we later on sat together for evening managers reception. It helps that I speak Spanish, I did see a few gringos. One thing that is accurate with other reviews, staff is friendly, but more used to chill island speed, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get impatient. Also the hotel is worn out, the carpet, walls, etc are in need of major renovation, the AC is also inconsistent. But rooms are clean, beds and bathrooms are clean Pool is great, large, with waterfalls, hot tubs, kids area. The bar has beer bucket deals, I think $10 for 5 of them. Breakfast is just ok, afternoon reception is also just ok, the place was full, long lines, but moved quickly. There was a mega wedding that Saturday night, the music vibrates throughout the atrium, till late night, so if you have a low floor room, it may be a problem, but I could not hear music once in my bedroom. Honestly it seemed so fun, that I wanted to crash it The hotel overlooks pool, then highway and airport. It is a $15 cab ride to airport. Bus to old san juan stops a block from hotel and takes you there in less than 15 minutes. On the way back we took a taxi since it was late. Two long blocks walk to beautiful beach in isla verde, you can walk through main street to plenty of familiar fast food places or authentic PR restaurants. Also, once exiting he hotel, on the right, about a 10 minute walk, there is a supermarket, so we went there our first night, bought food, snacks and drinks and stored them in our suite refrigerator.

We found the staff to pleasant and accomodating. The rooms were spacious and very clean, and the quality of the bedding was excellent. Rooms consist of two room suites, with a living room/dining room separate from the sleeping area. This was very convenient on the evenings that the kids and I just wanted to grab a pizza from the snack bar in the lobby and chill in front of the TV. My daughter loved the extra TV and the privacy.

On the beach, two blocks away, a separate area is reserved for hotel guests with complimentary towels, lounge chairs, and umbrellas, which made it easy to just grab your sunglasses and go. Equally convenient is the public bus one block away, across from the Ponderosa restaurant, which will take you into Old San Juan for 75 cents. On the down side, several washing machines were out of order, and the arm chair in the living room of our suite was a bit worn looking.

Picked the hotel primarily because of price, breakfast buffet and proximity to the beach. Suite was as expected - comfortable, spacious and clean. Buffet - July 3rd and 4th were very busy and the lines were very long. Wait was about 40 minutes each day. After those days, the crowd left and the wait was less than 10 minutes. In general, the food was good. Advice, if you don't want the cook to order, just say excuse me and go to the front of the line - the layout almost forces you to stay in the line even if you don't want the omelettes or pancakes Drinks in the afternoon - didn't do them but the lines were long. They also had popcorn, nachos and soft drinks - no lines there. Pool - Comfortable, didn't get too crowded. Plenty of towels. Would like to have a bar or grill at the pool but not having one wasn't a big deal. Beach (Isla Verde) - went there the morning of July 4th. First, to find the Embassy Suites area, you have to go left about 200 yards and look for the Embassy Suites sign - wasn't easy to find it but you get complimentary beach chairs and towels. The set up was nice but around noon it got very crowded and very loud. There must have been 50 people sitting under the trees by the Embassy Suites sign - it was shaded. They were playing music and cooking out. It did get a bit loud but i was in the water so it wasn't that big of a deal. The people weren't bothering anybody - it was more like a celebration... Only went one other time and it was later in the afternoon - it was quiet then. Taxis - always available. $13 to the airport and $22 to Old San Juan. Other - there are restaurants and other stores a few streets away (Chili's, fast food, a couple of Puerto Rican restaurants, Walgreens and a grocery store). There were also a lot of kids - but it's a family hotel and that's to be expected. They were all well behaved. Hotel Store - forget the name of it but it was great. Sold pizza, hot dogs, drinks and snacks - all at a reasonable price. Outback Steakhouse - had dinner there one night. Opens at 5:30, good service, reasonable prices. I saw comments about the staff not being friendly - they were all friendly with me and my family. The hotel isn't a 5 star luxury hotel but it's very good at what it does.

The fitness facility was well-appointed, and access to a decent beach was short walk down the block. But this is not really an area you want to be wandering around late.

Hispeed WiFi is included, of course, for the HHonors member (and for a modest fee otherwise). WiFi is free at the lobby area, as are public terminals and free business desk support. While you will not get a view of the beach, they have a very nice pool area with bar and cafe, one of the best local coffee shops I visited, a pleasant bar, and Outback's steakhouse. The typical Continental-plus Breakfast each morning provides real value, and surrounding the hotel are all the typical high- and low-end restaurants. (Ruth's Chris, Ponderosa, BK, etc.) Just 5 minutes walk and 2 blocks away is a wonderful Florida-style public beach with walk-up bar, cafe, skee-dos, parasailing, and $4/day loungers at a beautiful cove-protected ocean. Several car-rental companies are a block away and will come to the hotel, and you are just 15 minutes from old San Juan for touring. However, I recommend you use taxis. Except for the city-style highway (no Interstates in P.R.), roads are very narrow and parking extremely limited. Furthermore, roads close and dead-end without warning, and the \"transito\" or one-way roads have no semblance of order! Even with a GPS, I found navigating the area challenging and reverted to taxis. While we will undoubtedly book the Hotel El Convento (see my review), this is hotel gets top-honors from us for an economical visit to friends or to languish at the beach in P.R.!", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cIt did the job\u201d", "Author": "Emzaro", "ReviewID": "UR99890081", "Content": "We went to PR for a much needed break from the cold and snow and to visit family. We chose Embassy suites because we are a family of 5 (kids:10,13,15) and this is the only hotel in all of PR that could fit 5 people without getting 2 rooms. There are some nice places with villas around the island, but we were using Hilton points that only allowed a stay in a hotel and not a timeshare/villa. That being said, it was perfect for what we needed.... a place big enough, breakfast included, pool, and beach. Here is some info: location - convenient, 5 minutes from airport (you can see it next to highway), planes flying over didn't take away from experience, if your little ones like airplanes it may even be a plus ha! pool - very nice, plenty of room, not heated which can be chilly for me in February spa- didn't do , but it was a hut behind pool area where you could have mani/pedi, massage casino - small, looks fun, but not the place singles would go to meet people..too small. We didn't bother because it was a family trip room - spacious for 4, but a bit tight for 5- we tried sleeping on fold-out couch so kids could be in the separate room with double beds. That didn't work. My husband and I ended up on a bed with 2 kids on the other. The youngest slept on the fold-out because he was light enough to not feel all the springs and bars. beach- very short walk, but you do need to cross a busy street (no traffic light) as another reviewer mentioned. Once you get to the beach, you have to walk left a little ways until you see the Embassy Suites banners where you can get chairs and towels. The beach is ok. This is not the part of the island where you get white, fine sand. Also, whoever sat on the chairs before us left a corona bottle and about 15 botttle caps in the sand which my husband and I cleaned up... shame on whoever did that.. no respect! food - breakfast was fine. I don't know what people complained about in other reviews. It's like any other buffet.. eggs, bacon/sausage, fruit, french toast, cereal, etc... you can also order an omelette made the way you want. The fruit was ok.. pineapple great.. cantaloupe hard. I think some people complain about it because they expect a gourmet meal.. maybe they should be staying at the Ritz or something. You get what you pay for. We never ate dinner at the hotel. We ate in Old San Juan and at the restaurant Mi Casita down the street. It's very close and the food was great! They deliver to the hotel, too.. typical Puerto Rican food.. loved it! Parking - I think it was $17/day I could complain about the fact that the music blasted on weekends until midnight or something..... that we were a towel short and it took the front desk until the next day to bring it (they said 20 minutes) or that we ordered an extra blanket and didn't get it for 2 days (after mentioning it to the desk on phone once and staff twice) , but hey ! we were on vacation and relaxing and this place did the job. We went to Old San Juan twice, drove to Gu\u00c3\u00a1nica to the mangrove island called \"Guilligan island\", visited Ponce, and went to Arecibo to see the observatory, and we also saw family.. perfect!! Although we honestly enjoyed our stay, we wouldn't stay there again. ** Get connecting rooms if you have a family bigger than 4.

The bus ride was longer than a cab but only 75 cents is right up my alley! I booked through Expedia (air & hotel from Chicago) although we had a late check in of 11:30 pm the front desk staff was so accomodating in getting us checked in quickly and letting us know the lay of the land. We got our bags into the room on the 2nd floor and headed to the bar. It was a bit disappoinng for my sis that the bar keep did not have mint for mojito's or her type of vodka. He was courteous and efficient in setting us up with our 2nd choice cocktails. We did check out the casino but did not gamble. it was loud and yes you can hear it from your living room but as others have said, the bedroom was quiet. I must express that the beds were fantastic! having a bad back and sleeping on a theraputic mattress at home, I was worried without need. The bed and pillows were so comfortable that my sleep was never affected! The room was clean with plenty of towels. I do wish they would put regular blankets in the closet for covering up on the couch though. The complimentary breakfast was superb! The staff friendly and quick. I can not believe how many people do not tip. I know its included but come on, these folks work hard, have a great attitude and take fantastic care of their guests! The happy hour was appreciated after coming back from day long excursions! Again, Tip your bartender! The only negative I would have is the hot tub and parents who believe that is their childrens bath tub or swimming pool. I did read the rules of the tub and it says \"children under 18 must be accompanied by a parent\" Personally I do not want kids in my hot tub but I am not the proprieter. I would highly recommend this location to those who want to go to Fajardo or the rain forest as well as the other direction into OSJ.

I would have preferred a quiet hotel, but I was able to co-exist here. The staff in every section were very good. There is no control at the pool so the kids took over the pool, period. The families were up partying till way after midnight. Expect noise when they return to their hotel rooms. Expect lines for breakfast and for the Managers reception. When you make your reservation, ask what kind of parties they have booked during your stay. This will help you decide if the amenities are worth it should the hotel have big parties scheduled. I will recommend the hotel but expect that you will check on what to expect before you book it.

It was not that clean, paint was chipping, the wood on the door was stripped. It was just tacky. The couch felt like it was made of plastic. The bedroom was tiny and we had a view of the parking lot and construction site. Another con was that the hotel is located in a heavy construction zone. The beach (Isla Verde) was NOT one of the nicest, quite dirty in fact. My advice would be to spend a couple of extra hundred bucks (if you can) and stay in Condodo. It's worth it, especially if you're on an extended stay. Staff was not very courteous. They treated us like we were an annoyance.

This property did not disappoint in regards to those criteria. Breakfast was tasty and there were tons of food options. The evening manager's reception/cocktail hour was a bit more chaotic. The lines were very long, but did move quickly. I stuck with wine so it wasn't watered down, as some previous posters have commented. The snacks were a bit skimpy: popcorn and crumbled/broken chex type mix. Don't expect to make a meal of it, but it's free, right? We enjoyed the pool area and felt they do a good job disguising the fact you're backed up to the highway. Room was clean and roomy and soundproofing was excellent. We didn't hear planes despite proximity to the airport and we didn't hear the bar/lobby/casino area directly below us on our final night. You are within walking distance to the beach, a small market, and several restaurants including fast food if you desire. There are also three free computers with internet access in the lobby to quickly look through your email, etc.. Also, the indoor garden/atrium area is a very nice place to sit and visit. I actually had family visiting Puerto Rico at the same time staying in a different area. We enjoyed sitting in the atrium area for over an hour visiting while the kids enjoyed the koi pond, arcade, and riding the glass elevators. On the down side you're quite far from Old San Juan so if this is your objective stay there instead. The cab ride to OSJ and the cruise port was $15 for five of us plus $1 per piece of luggage. That was expensive enough that we didn't want to go into OSJ for an evening meal or some exploring. The taxi ride from the airport (which you can see from the hotel) was about $12 plus $1 per bag. Pretty excessive, IMHO. I'd recommend this hotel for a brief stay as it is a good value and near the beach. Although the pool is nice, it's not a \"resort\" pool as it is on the small side. Rooms don't have balconies or views so don't consider this property if you're looking for a romantic extended stay. If you're looking for beachfront, consider Priceline and try to get one of the many beachfront hotels a few blocks away. Or if you want the ambiance of Old San Juan (but no beach) consider hotels in that area. We were very pleased with our stay here as it met all our needs.

It is very close to the airport which was convenient and you do hear the planes when outside at the pool. We rented a car so we didn't check out accessibility to public transporation etc. Room was typical Embassy Suite (ES) layout - but couch was not in good shape as previous reviewer noted. Safe did not have electronic combo - you needed to make a $85 security deposit to get the key from front desk - let's them know you have valuable stuff in your room doesn't it? Bathroom had some signs of aging - caulking smeared all along the floor, missing in parts of the shower enclosure and a few missing curtain hooks. As a Diamond member, we are entitled to have certain amenities brought to our room which they apparently don't do before check in - they wait until 6:30 or 7 or in my case, when I go down and ask for them the second time because they weren't there by 8PM. At other ES, they are in the room when I check in since my room has been preassigned. There is a casino in the lobby. We are used to noisy kids and people in the lobby having their voices echo, but the loud music that goes until midnight (or 1 on Friday-Sunday) is quite loud, even with the door to your room closed and is easily heard over the television. Evening reception was ridiculous - the drinks were dispensed from a fountain tap and were so watered down, I don't think anyone had checked to see if the syrup needed to be refilled in some time. Breakfast was a bit disorganized as is often the case at ES. For some reason, the flow doesn't work and there are choke points in the process. Lots of tables in the lobby to use and they were kept clean which is something we don't usually see. The two guys who were cooking really hustled. Pool was nice - lots of lounge chairs. Good sun exposure for most of the day. Bartender had to call to get instructions on how to charge my drink to the room. Note to food manager - That should have been covered a few times before leaving him outside alone. All in all, we enjoyed our trip to San Juan, but will stay at another hotel on our return. We recommend you learn from our experiences and stay somewhere else. If I had been told that this particular ES was not at the high end of their quality range, I would have stayed elsehere.

There is a Walgreens and many restaurants nearby, including Starbucks about 2 blocks away at El San Juan Hotel. We were able to tour El San Juan and also El Conquistador Hotels during our visit, and found them to be elegant but a bit highbrow for our taste.

The rooms as well were terribly disappointing. The carpet felt soggy, and the room itself had a musty smell. Worst of all one of our bed sheets had a brown stain on them, which looked like dried blood or food. Furniture was old and there were several damaged lighting fixtures hanging awkwardly from the walls. The hotel was very crowded, mainly with families and lots of children and teens.

Got to the Embassy Suites around 5pm. Check in was a breeze. I asked for a room overlooking the SJU runway and they quickly accomodated. The suite was very nice. There were 2 beds for the kids and I slept on the pull out couch. Although, when I woke up the next morning I began to itch from what I can only think were some type of bugs. The kids didnt complain of itching so I was okay and decided I could live with it. Anyway, back to check-in on the first day, we went directly to the pool and relaxed. The next morning, Sunday May 16th, my birthday, I woke up to a note under my door that there was a 5.8 tremblor in the zone of Mayaguex which is about 120 miles west of San Juan. It occured about 1am however I didnt feel it. It woke my son up. I didnt notice any items had shifted. But, what a bang to start a birthday. Anyway, back to the hotel. The breakfast buffet is everything other reviewers have said. They cook omlets to order. Plus, there is bacon, sausage, potatoes, corn beef hash, pancakes, french toast, fruits, cereal, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, et al. The atrium area on the weekend had vendors that were showing their wares(sp). There was even a man who was making pottery with a clay machine. It reminded me of Demi Moore in \"Ghost\". The nice part of that was that he would let the kids try their hand at pottery making. The only downside was Carolina experienced some torrential downpours that flooded the streets and consequently affected the roof and subsequently the pipes which caused some problems. Specifically, there was no water coming out of the shower. I called the front desk and they told me it would be rectified in \"10 minutes\" Maintenance came to my room twice. All told it took approximately 90 minutes. The maintenance man was so apologetic that there was no way I could hold onto my disgust. We did experience the opportunity to eat at the Outback Steakhouse on the property and the staff was great. To be honest, the food alright. The kids loved it though. Since it was my birthday, they sang happy birthday to me in both english and spanish. Another night I got pizza for the kids from the Atrium Cafe. They didnt have any complaints. Because there are so many fast food places nearby, like Church's Chicken, Ponderosa, Burger King, Chilis, et al, everyone should be able to dine on what they want and be happy.

After deparking from our cruise ship, the Carnival Victory, we made our way to the Embassy Suites and arrived there around 11:00 am. The disadvantage of arriving so early, was that our room was not ready and we were told, would not be ready until 3:30 pm. In the meantime, we were given a pool access card and were able to store our luggage in the secured confines of the Conference Room. It was amazing to see this room filled with so many bags\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand they all had Carnival Victory tags on them too! After dropping off our luggage, we changed into our swim suits and hung out with other Carnival Victory cruisers by the enormous tropical landscaped pool complete with waterfalls!

We had a spacious suite on the 7th floor, (complete with mini-fridge and microwave), overlooking the gorgeous, free-form tropical pool. The boys were immediately drawn to the large 37\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd flat-screen TV! The lobby Atrium is very nicely landscaped with tropical plants, ponds and waterfalls. There are four glass elevators, allowing its passengers to peer down into the tropical beauty of the Atrium. In the morning we enjoyed the hot buffet breakfast, served until 9:30 am in the tropical Atrium. The breakfast buffet included bacon, sausages, cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, fresh fruit, juices, coffee, tea and even soda! The Embassy Suites also offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made-to-order\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast which included omelets, eggs and pancakes. The breakfast was plentiful and delicious! After being spoiled with all the good food on the Carnival Victory, the breakfast provided at the Embassy Suites was the next best thing to being back on the Lido Deck! Another nice perk offered by the Embassy Suites was the Managers Reception Party, held every evening from 5:30-7:30 pm, in the tropical Atrium. During the Managers Reception, guests are offered free alcoholic drinks and soft drinks. Free snacks including popcorn, peanuts, party mix or chips with salsa were also offered. The Manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reception party was a big hit with the boys. No matter where we were in Puerto Rico, or what excursion we were doing, we always had to get back to the resort in time for the Managers Reception.

We were very excited to see that there was a bell hop immediately willing to help with out bags (which was good as we had the whole family's bags and some of the other army boy's bags.) We were able to check in early and the desk was very helpful and courteous during check in! The loby is very nice! There is air conditioning, a large fish tank, palm trees, and nice brook with fish in it, a gazebo, and couches. The rooms are sufficient and the beds are pretty comfortable.

The pool area is outstanding!! There is a large pool with a waterfall, a kiddie pool, and a hot tub. The pool deck has lots of palm trees and a fun little tunnel under the water fall that the kids liked to play in. The pool was a good temperature to cool off in. The hotel provided some floats for the kids to play on. The area itself was closed off to non-visitors by a lovely wooden fence and palm trees. (Much better then the chain fences many places use). The pool bar was pretty good (doesn't except cash) and the bar tender worked pretty fast and was very good at multi-tasking! The lounge chairs were plentiful and comfortable and there were several tables to put your things on. My family and I were very impressed with the pool area! The only two little things that I could mention need improvement is the outside shower didn't really work and the pool towels have seen better days. The included breakfast is AMAZING! It included French toast, several meats, potatoes, all the continental breads, and made to order omelets and pancakes. I have paid 20 dollars per person at other hotels for breakfast of this caliber at hotels. One thing to note, it is hard to find seating and the line gets long after 830am, but we always got up early and napped by the pool after breakfast. Happy hour is a nice touch! For two hours there are free drinks (alcoholic and non) and popcorn and chips and salsa. My teen really liked getting a fruit punch that looked like a rum punch and lounging at the pool with it!

(5) Room overlooking the atrium can be noisy, but not all rooms overlook the atrium, so ask for one that doesn't. You might still, however, have a lot of street noise. (6) The free booze at night attracts a rather white-trashy crowd. I'd much prefer if they had less alchohol and some real appetizers, instead of stale chips.

They had backup amenities that were brought to the room in record time :) The rooms were suites that were very spacious and quiet. The bathroom was huge and very clean. The bed was plush and relaxing and we didn't want to get out! Great pillows, mattress and linens! The OUTBACK steakhouse located within the hotel was friendly and great food. It was also close to the laundry area. So we could wash our airport clothes while we had dinner. So easy and convenient! Their HAPPY HOUR in the evenings from 5:30 to 7:30 was incredible and so nice. FREE drinks, including rum punch, and snacks are offered. As well, the FREE BREAKFAST was so amazing, we talked about it all day. It was by far one of the best free buffet breakfast experiences I have ever had. They served food on the whole spectrum. From hot meats, eggs, french toast to cereal, fruit, pastries etc. Really nice! The Casino was a blast and gave us some nearby entertainment without having to leave. And the pool was awesome. With great hours of 7am to 10pm, we enjoyed as much as possible. The pool was amazingly huge so you didn't feel like you were on top of other people and the hot tub was romantic and cozy! GREAT - AMAZING - FABULOUS! We only stayed two nights because we were stuck and hadn't planned on this hotel, BUT we would go back just to visit San Juan.

Every single day the pool ran out of towels so our kids were freezing when they came out of the pool, which I don't believe was heated.

The pool bar/\"restaurant\" closes at 3pm every day so after that you are on your own for food/drinks unless you want to wait for 20 mins at the indoor lobby bar for mediocre food. Maid service was spotty - one day the room wasn't made up until 6pm, one day they didn't deliver any towels or toilet paper, etc. Our room was mid-sized and although it had 2 separate living spaces, it felt small and dark. There are no balconies and all rooms open out to a central courtyard area which is noisy at night. The free breakfast is average and ends at 9:30am, so if you want breakfast after that you have to walk to the Denny's which is 15 minutes away. The gym was out of hand-sanitizer, the pizza place was out of large pizzas, and the pay-per-view function on the TV did not work. The beach is a 10 minute walk which wouldn't be so bad except that you have to cross a busy street and the walk itself is gross (past several dumpsters, not well-lit, etc.) The hotel is literally 5 mins from the airport - you can almost walk there, but there is some noise from the planes and the highway when you are sitting out at the pool.

Our very good friends were also celebrating. We decided to celebrate together along with our 6 children. We booked a Caribbean cruise. This was not our first cruise but it was our friends. We wanted to fly to San Juan a day early and enjoy the island before our departure on the ship. I searched high and low for hotels and prices. Our biggest bump in the road was that each family consisted of 5 people. 4 of the family members were 18 or older. About 99% of the hotels in San Juan will only accomodate 4 people at the most. And they charge extra after the first 2 people in the room. So my dilemma was paying extra for my adult children plus having to get a second room. We were paying $600 plus for a hotel night stay. I was getting pretty discouraged how costly this 1 extra night was going to cost. My friends were fine with paying the higher costs but I was determined to cut our costs. Then I came upon the Embassy Suites. They had no problem accomodating each of our families in a single room suite. I was getting excited. The cost was under $200 for the night. Much more reasonable than $600 plus. When we arrived at the Embassy Suites, we were very pleased. The hotel was beautiful. The inside of the hotel looked like a tropical setting with running water and everything. All the rooms looked into this atrium area and also had outside windows. We had a perfect view of the pool. The pool was amazing. I felt like we were at some expensive resort. They even had a made-to-order breakfast included in the hotel price. The rooms were clean, the staff helpful. They even stored our luggage for us and gave us late checkout with no extra charge. We were all very pleased. The only downfall was the hotel is not on the beach, but it's only a block or so walk.

They have my phone number, email and this was supposed to be a non refundable booking. Absolutely disgusting. The did offer me a complementary stay at another hotel nearby and I had to settle for it.

We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel (about a 5-minute ride; cost right around $15). Check-in was friendly and efficient; we were in suite 717. The way the hotel is set up, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a group of three glass elevators near the entrance / front desk, and one lone glass elevator on the other side of the atrium. All of the elevators move very quickly and smoothly, so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a long wait for an elevator, regardless of which elevator bank you use. Our suite was right next to the single elevator, but there was never any elevator noise audible in the suite, nor was there any airplane noise even though the hotel is right by the airport, nor was there any traffic noise even though the hotel is right by two busy highways. The only noise we heard came from the noisy guests next door to us, but if they had been talking at a normal volume (i.e. if their kids hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been screaming), we probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been able to hear them at all. Upon entering the room, we were a bit disappointed in how small it was. When the three of us travel, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to staying in 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom suites, but since we were only staying 3 nights, and 2-bedroom suites were so much more expensive than 1-bedrooms at this hotel, we decided we could live with a 1-bedroom. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect anything huge, but this was just tiny. Residence Inns, which are typically much less expensive than Embassy Suites, have much bigger suites than we had at the Embassy Suites. There was no full kitchen, just a tiny microwave, mini-fridge, and sink. The only table in the room was a peninsula table big enough for one or two people to sit at. My parents slept in the bedroom, and I slept on the sofa bed in the living room; when it was folded out, there was almost no room to walk through the living room to get to the bedroom and bathroom. (The sofa bed wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly comfortable, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t horrible, either. With the right combination of pillows, it was doable.) Also, the pictures on the website show flat-panel HDTVs in the suites; we had two very old CRT TVs. The carpet had too many stains and discolorations to count. The room had a sort of musty smell to it, and the bathroom had mold up near the ceiling. The AC unit was supposed to be white, but a good part of it was brown with rust (see pictures). There was also no fan in the bathroom. There was a shortage of electrical outlets in the room, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen that problem before and I came prepared by bringing a surge protector for my laptop, phone charger, fan, etc. At least my parents slept well on the beds in the bedroom; they were basically the only good things about the room. Apart from the room, though, the hotel was gorgeous. The open atrium created a great atmosphere, and glass elevators are always a nice touch. The casino was great; the gambling age in Puerto Rico is 18, and by law, all casinos are smoke-free, which was perfect for me, a 19-year-old non-smoker who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand the smell of smoke but would still like to play some blackjack. There were several restaurants / places to get food in the hotel, as well as a poolside bar that was supposed to be open until 5 PM daily (although it closed each day due to rain, and even though the rain cleared up well before 5 PM, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reopen). The food was delicious, but very overpriced; a simple burger was $11. At the pool bar, soft drinks are sold by the can, with no free refills. At the atrium restaurant and lobby bar area, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sold in a more typical way, by the glass, with free refills; I think they were $2.50 each there. Wireless internet access is available throughout the hotel at no additional cost (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s covered by the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14% resort fee). You have to call the front desk for the internet access code, and you have to re-enter it every 24-hour period. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty slow, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better than nothing (and hey, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complimentary). (There is no hard-wired internet access in the room.) They also have a business center and a kiosk where you can print off boarding passes and get checked in for your flight before you go to the airport. We only went to the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception once. The lines for alcoholic beverages (beer and wine) were very long. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a drinker, so I opted for the free soft drinks instead; they have Coke products, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m definitely a fan of. They also offered various snacks, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take a close look at them to see exactly what they offered. The manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception takes place daily from 5:30 to 7:30 PM in the atrium near the pool entrance. Speaking of free food and drinks, they also offer a free cooked-to-order breakfast every morning. On weekdays, it ends at 9:30 AM; on Saturdays and Sundays, it ends at 10:30. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a late sleeper, so I never made it out of bed in time to enjoy it. My dad went; he said the lines were long, and the food was average. I also saw a sign in the casino advertising free breakfast every day until 11:30 AM, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like a full breakfast; the picture looked like a few pieces of toast and some fruit. The pool area was huge and beautiful, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it much. I swam for a little while on the first day, but the water seemed a little cool to me. Then again, it had just rained and it was still cloudy, and I consider anything less than about 84 to be cool. I was able to get all the way in, it just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleasant. The hot tub was perfect, though. They also had a kiddie pool off to the side, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anyone in it. I would not recommend renting a car and driving in Puerto Rico if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not familiar with the island and the way they drive; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty different from typical U.S. driving (much more aggressive, and taxis seem to always have the right of way no matter which way they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going). Just walk or take a taxi wherever you need to go. We went to the Plaza Las Am\u00c3\u00a9ricas two out of the three days we were there; it was about $20 each way, so plan to spend a lot on taxis if you want to get anywhere, but it still beats the heck out of renting a car and driving down there. The Plaza Las Am\u00c3\u00a9ricas is their shopping mall, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got everything from Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to Gap to Borders (an epic two-story Borders at that) and a bunch of local stores, in addition to some 40 restaurants (some fast food and some sit-down). The first day there, we ate at Chili\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The Chili\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants down there have a few menu items that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have in the States; I highly recommend the classic chuletas (delicious lightly-fried and seasoned pork chops). The second day there, 6/12, we were there for the Coheed and Cambria signing on the first floor of Borders; there were well over 200 people there in line to meet the band and get their items signed. (Claudio and the others are amazingly cool, down-to-earth people and incredibly talented musicians. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never given Coheed and Cambria a good listen, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d highly recommend it.) After that, we ate at Subway and then grabbed a taxi to the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Miguel Agrelot, where the Coheed concert was; they were absolutely incredible, as they almost always are live. (Claudio, their lead singer, is Puerto Rican by heritage, so he and the band decided to play a gig in Puerto Rico for the first time; the crowd was definitely happy about that.) It was a little difficult to catch a taxi back to the hotel after the concert. We expected them to have cabs lined up for people who needed to get places but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have rides, but we had to ask a security guy how to get a cab; he just found another one that was already full and asked the driver to call another one to the Coliseo, which he did. I never walked to the beach, but my dad did a couple of the days we were there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty short, safe walk. He took some pictures of the beach, and it really is gorgeous. Our flight home didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave until 3:00, so my dad (an HHonors member) asked for a late check-out of 1:00 and got it with no problem. One very important note about flights from Puerto Rico back to the States: before you stand in that long line to check your bags, you first have to go through a separate line for USDA inspection. There are a few signs that indicate this, but they are not detailed; they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you that you have to go stand in a separate line before standing in the line to check your bags, but you do. Go to the USDA inspection line FIRST, and THEN the line to check your bags. Oh, and one last tip about the hotel: right next to the 08 room on each floor (e.g., room 708 on the seventh floor), there are vending machines with Cokes and waters for $1 each. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay $2.50 for a bottled water at the Atrium Caf\u00c3\u00a9 / Noble Roman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place when you can get them for a buck each next to the 08 room. I also heard that there are snack AND drink vending machines next to room 208, but just drink vending machines on the other floors. Overall, the hotel got the job done, but it wasn't a very pleasant experience due to the problems with the room. I'd recommend staying elsewhere (although I'm not sure where, since I'm not familiar with San Juan at all... maybe El San Juan resort and casino). If you have three or more people, definitely go for a 2-bedroom suite, as a 1-bedroom gets awfully crowded (especially considering how tiny the 1-bedrooms at this Embassy Suites are).", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nyc", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, expensive but worth it.\u201d", "Author": "travlingalNyc", "ReviewID": "UR31451641", "Content": "We stayed here one night prior to cruise.

They are on the left under a large old tree at the beach as soon as you get to the end of the block. Vendors wander up and down the beach selling ice cream, water, beer. They are not aggressive - just available if you want them. The beach is excellent. More crowded on weekends (with locals) then on weekdays. The casino at Embassy Suites was also very nice as was the Outback Steakhouse. There is a 24 hour very large grocery store a short (3 minute) walk from the front of the hotel. Internet (wireless) in the room was free (we got a code on our room key package) at check in. Taxi from the airport was $15. Trip from airport to hotel about 10 minutes total. The hotel even hosted 2 senior proms during our stay - something like this would usually raise my eyebrows, but the hotel handled the kids and crowds so well we never even noticed. Intercontinental & El San Juan are both a very short walk (5 minutes?) - we visited both properties and they are nice enough, but twice as much money. Not worth the money.

We flew into San Juan for an extended weekend trip, stayed in Isla Verde for 3 nights, then went to Old San Juan for 2 more nights. We used Hilton points to book our stay here at the Embassy Suites in Isla Verde. I really enjoyed this hotel! I was unsure before we booked it because I generally like being right downtown near attractions when I travel and am more concerned about location than the actual hotel, however this stay far exceeded my expectations, and in fact I enjoyed our time here more than I did at our place in Old San Juan. The hotel is located right down the street from the airport, our taxi ride took less than 10 minutes. The lobby is huge, there is a casino in one corner, which was not too crowded and had great games, a business center with complimentary internet use, a restaurant/bar, and then the rest of the lobby is dedicated to a seating area used for breakfast and happy hour (both of which were delicious). The hotel rooms form a square around the lobby so that the railings all look over the lobby, which was neat because in the morning you could look down and see how long the breakfast line was and in the evening you could hear the bands playing by the bar. I was in a room with a king sized bed and a living room, over looking the pool. The room was standard for an Embassy Suites, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to one you know exactly what to expect, and as always it provided lots of space to relax. Microwave and refrigerator also included. The pool at the hotel is amazing, it's large, has a wide deck around it and has waterfalls running through it. I never had a problem grabbing a chair in the sun. The gym is less than fantastic, it's your basic tiny hotel gym with no windows, a few cardio machines and a couple free weights. The beach is a short walk down the street, and there are lots of restaurants in the area, both chains (burger king, subway, etc.), and local establishments. We rented a car one day from another hotel which was in walking distance. The manager's hour was awesome at this hotel, free drinks (you should tip!) and snacks for a few hours, my boyfriend and I enjoyed local rum and beer each evening before heading out for dinner or to the casino. The crowd was mostly families, lots of whom were boarding a cruise ship the next day. Since that is not my scene I got a little annoyed by the small children and obnoxious parents, but on our final night there, there must not have been a boat scheduled and we had most of the place to ourselves, which was awesome! I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel when traveling to San Juan, the amenities are fantastic, and the hotel staff was lovely. Isla Verde is a perfect place to stay too, don't be afraid that it's out of the way, there is plenty to do right by the hotel.

We last stayed in June '08 at the time of the infamous prom. We got a great welcome basket upon our return to the hotel. Much better visit this time. This is our first visit with our son (10 yrs old) and he loved the hotel just as much as we did. Let me share some tips: Hotel Tips: - Check in isn't until 4:00 - I would suggest you to become a Hilton Member to get in earlier. -Cab rides from the airport (less than 10 minutes away) will cost $13 -Room has a lot of space for a family. The sofabed was to be expected, but we just asked for extra blankets. -The breakfast was great. If you are looking for a great omlet or traditional Puerto Rican avena (oatmeal), this is the spot for you. We got to breakfast each day at 7 and it wasn't busy. Any time after 8 is packed. -The staff was efficient, but not overly friendly. -The pool looked average - wasn't too impressed. -Several coqui got into the lobby and we heard them singing all night - it was a beautiful sound! Isla Verde Beach: We love this beach. We have been to other beaches in PR and we found this one to be very nice. IThe current is not to strong and allows for some great waves. t is pretty slow during the week, but on the weekend it is packed. Be prepared for a busy beach. But, we had a great time. -You can get beach chairs (small ones) from the hotel for free. Try to get those early also. -It is two long blocks to the beach - I would suggest that you walk on the right side of the street so that you are in the crosswalk. Be careful at the busy intersection before the beach - there isn't a stop light. -You can rent chairs ($4) and an umbrella for $10. They get there at 9 and take them back around 4:45 -Pack snacks - ice cre am, beer, and hot dogs are sold nearby, but it may be a good idea to bring your stuff with you. -We usually got to the beach around 9 each morning and it was very quiet. Restaurants: -Mi Casita is the best, by far. Not the best service, but great food. We spent around $34-$51, including tips. This is our 2nd time visiting here. Do not call any orders in - they won't accept it. Choose your own seat! If you wait at the door, you will be ignored! A block from the hotel. -Metropol - cheaper and better service than Mi Casita - but the food wasn't that great. It was nice to compare. You can walk, but it is a hike. It is a $8 cab ride to the restaurant. -Pueblo - even though this is a grocery store, they have a deli. The food was fantastic and cheap. You can buy a plate (mean, rice/beans, maduros) for less than $8. It is literally around the corner from the hotel. Old San Juan: The cab ride from the hotel to OSJ is around $19. You can take a bus, but we didn't try it. -We attempted to buy a kite - it cost $5 for the kite and $1 for the string. If you don't know how to fly a kite or put it together, then, you are better of watching the pros! -Cemetary (can't remember the name of it) is beautiful - beautiful sculpture and views of Old San Juan. You can see graves from the last 5 years to over a hundred years old. -El Morro - fantastic fort to take the kids. The stairs below are very narrow and slippery at times. Great view. Took our son to the top level and just let him run - great views of the ocean, coastline and city. -Ate at El Patio de Sams - nice food - great service. We had 2 Cuban sandwiches and a vegetarian plate - it cost us around $30. -Take the kids to a pigeon park - for $1 you can buy bird seed and they will land on you! El Yunque: Rainforest was beautiful! We had a guide to take us. He was fantastic! Mr.Rincon was fantastic. If you want a guide to show you the real PR and the best of El Yunque - he is your man. He took us to a deserted part of the rainforest. We saw some beautiful waterfalls and let our son swim in one. There is also a visitor's center that isn't to be missed! You can get cell phone service at the entrance of the park, but that is where it stops! I absolutely love Isla Verde. This is our 2nd trip in 10 months. My advice for you is to bring some sunscreen, bug spray (especially when visiting the Courtyard), SPF50, plenty of singles (dollar bills) and a great attitude. The hotel is a great one. We are not folks who will ever go to a Ritz Carlon or the El San Juan. We like the hotel for its comfort, convenience, and overall price. We loved it and our son loved it!

On one hand, it is really close to the airport, so cab-fares were low ($12 each way).

You can rent a beachchair from the El San Juan Hotel for the entire day for $5 and listen to the waves crashing against the white sand beach (which is how a vacation should be). The only problem with this scenario is, the 3 block walk between the Embassy Suites and the beach is a little sketchy. There is a lot of trash along the walkway, and then to get to the final block, you have to cross Isla Verde Avenue, which is a busy road and there is no crossing signal.

They are courteous and go out of their way to make your stay to your liking. That being said, I must say that the room quality is becoming an issue. We stayed there last year and at that time I thought the rooms needed some upgrading. They are not lighted properly, very dim in front room area. The sofa sleepers on both of these trips were not worthy to be slept on. We had another couple with us and they said they were just horrible as far as comfort. Also they need to get the latest flat screen TV's. The ones they have are ancient. The rooms just look worn out and need some new decor and brightness.", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cParadise\u201d", "Author": "BronxBorinquen", "ReviewID": "UR24066448", "Content": "I highly recommend this hotel because it was in such a beautiful isolated location, the rooms were large and very clean, wonderful service and breathtaking landscaping.

Traveling from California, we had to leave at 6am Pacific time and not arrive in PR via Dallas until 10pm PR time. By the time we got to the Embassy Suites, all the restaurants were closed despite the website indicating that the Outback steakhouse would be open until 2am. The manager said that only the bar was ever open that late. When I informed him of the error in the hotel's website, he seemed to care less. I would hope they would correct this information because on the cab ride to the hotel, the cabbie offered to pull into a fast food place and get my family food (two very young, starving kids plus 4 exhausted adults). Instead, I opted to trust the hotel website and it was wrong. Secondly, we arrived to a virtual Calypso concert in the hotel lobby - so loud it was hard to hear the clerk at the check in desk. Apparently at least one wedding and one 50 year wedding anniversary were being celebrated. It was mid-night. No one could tell me when the party would end. We were tired and hungry and it didnt seem that rest nor food was going to come anytime soon. This is not what I signed up for. Had to take a cab 6 blocks to a very busy Chilis for dinner. They took an hour to make 5 sandwiches. Got back to the hotel at 130am with music still blaring. still no clue when the party would end. The room was able to void out most of the noise and my 1 year old was able to fall asleep with ease. Room was typical Embassy Suites - clean and comfortable. Breakfast bar was extremely busy and hard to find a table. Buffet line for made to order breakfast was a joke so I opted for precooked eggs, bacon, etc which was just fine and very fresh. otehr choices included tropical fruits, oatmeal, cereals, breads, coffee, milk, juices as you would expect. No newspaper delivered to our room and no Hilton Honors amenities (as an honors gold member, I typically get a free snack and bottled water on check in waiting in my room). I am used to this from all other Hilton brand hotel stays - but not a deal killer by any means. There is a small casino at this hotel with slot machines and a fwe table games. Check out is at noon and this was a very very busy time for the lobby. If you can check out earlier, you will miss the busy period. Check out seemed to maximize around 11am to 1130am. One phone and one remote control in our room was broken. We reported these to front desk but no fix ever came. Overall it was a cozy night, but a bit loud and searching for food options was not fun (pizza delivery ended at midnight). The rooms were fine as was the buffet (althought busy). I'd probably stay here again if just staying one night because of value and proximity to airport - but if you are looking for a long stay in San Juan, I would opt for something closer to the beach or closer to old town. We were advised not to walk the 6 blocks at night to the Chilis restaurant by hotel employees. The description of the beach being 1.5 blocks - hmmm, those are some long blocks. If you want optimum proximity to the cruise terminal, there is a Sheraton in old town right across the street from the terminal. The Embassy Suites is about a 30 min cab ride to the cruise terminal - and costs around $30. Cab from airpor to the hotel was $25 but we suspect we overpaid even though the cab fairs are predetermined by some cab authority at the airport. I bet we had some surpluss added just because we were picked up at the aiport. This fare was based on # of people. The fare to the cruise terminal seemed to be based on distance traveled. Whatever. I was confused. I didnt particularly like Puerto Rico anyway. I'll leave a review on the Carnival Victory elsewhere. If I fail to mention it there, the cruise terminal is horrible and mismanaged.

He came back and sweated abit, (turns out his manager was trying to make us pay full price) and then went and honoured the happy hour prices. It was now 6:55, he apologized a few times and seemed relieved that we were not upset...I wondered if this happened often?? We enjoyed our two meals there the first night the steaks and ribs were very good. Second time we arrived at 6 after a tiring day at the rainforest and the hamburgers and chicken burgers (and the happy hour margs LOL) were incredible :) The walk down to the Isla Verde BLVD is a quick maybe 3-5 min walk, I had thought (mistakenly) that we would have to walk two city blocks and cross a extremely busy almost freeway to get to the beach but this was not the case at all. We walked down the little side street to the crosswalk by the burger king strip mall and there was the most lovely beach WOW :) Speaking of the Burger King/Ponderosa strip mall there is a lovely Puerto Rician restaurant in there named Mi Casta)wrng name sorry but you will see it) We ate there once and it was great and very cheap and always busy :) We were delighted with the largness of our king bed one bedroom suite. Housekeeping always left the room spotless and changed our sheets the third day in. Buffet servers were always there to clear away plates and the servers at the Manager's reception were a delight. We made sure to tip housekeepers, breakfast staff and bartenders at the reception and our drinks were there within seconds of us standing in line. I truly can not say enough good things about this hotel and it's great value and staff!! Yea the furniture is a little dated but who cares?? We were not paying Westin, Intercontinental or Ritz -Carlton prices for this hotel. We paid $143.00 plus taxes and the resort fee , we had a car but did not do the valet parking and they actually waived our parking I think because I am a HH member. Nice touch.

We received a AAA rate of $152.99 plus tax, plus the hotels \"resort tax\" of 12% made the room around $180. Also, self parking in the parking garage was $14 a day. The hotel is located within a mile of the airport, but we were never bothered by plane noise. He was there on business, and I was there for pleasure. The resort tax allows you to make free local calls and use the wifi from your suite. Note: the wifi was sometimes weak on the 7th floor and not powerful enough to use in the bedroom part of the suite. Our room was clean, but the carpet needs to be replaced, and the furniture in the bedroom was nicked. A paint job was also needed in our suite. The king bed in our suite was comfortable, except for stiff pillows. The rate includes breakfast which includes made to order omelets or eggs (tip is not accepted like Embassy's in America); bad pancakes; so-so french toast; fruit; cereal; toast/bagels; juices; coffee; yogurts. Also included is the Manager's Reception Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30 nightly. You can get two drinks (or a double) per person at a time, but there is no limit to how many times you go back. There's one beer on tap, wines, and mid level alcohol. We tipped a dollar at each trip. Some people don't tip at all. Popcorn, a mix of chips, and pop were available as well. Service from the staff was not consistent. Some of the younger employees were not as helpful as the more mature ones. The pool is clean, huge and lovely. There's a pool bar, but it was never open. After numerous people asked for drink and food service, a staffer came out and took orders. Drinks were delivered promptly, but the food took over an hour. Except for a few smoking suites, this is a non-smoking hotel, as most establishments in Puerto Rico.. even the casinos. But, you can smoke outside at the pool, or out front of the hotel. There are ash trays and benches set up in the front, but no ashtrays by the pool. Most people just put their cigarettes out on the ground. Towels are available for free at the pool, and you can also take them to the beach which is a good 2 blocks away. We didn't make it to the beach but heard it was very nice. There's a self laundry room on the main level which requires $1.75 to wash and $1.50 for a 30 minute dry. The front desk will exchange bills for quarters and sell you a small ziploc bag full of powder detergent for $2.14. Note: There is a gift shop, but it's under renovation at this point. We ordered room service 4 times and the food was pretty good. Sometimes not as hot as we'd like, but we'd use the microwave in our suite to warm the food. If you like burgers, order them well-done, or they'll come out pretty rare. I recommend the french onion soup. Pizza Hut and Domino's delivers to the hotel, but you have to go to the lobby to retrieve it. We didn't order from Pizza Hut, but Domino's pizza was good and reasonable. Inside the hotel is an Outback Steakhouse. It's as good as any I've been to, but more expensive. It's open for dinner only Sunday - Friday, and opens for lunch on Saturdays. We ate lunch at Lupi's (near by) which was expensive and just so-so. Be careful ordering pop, no free refills. There are two ATMS in the hotel. There was no fee involved except for what your bank charges. You can also cash a check up to $100 a day at the front desk. Be prepared for your check being denied by the security check company they use. One of our checks was approved, the other denied. The casino is on the small side. Lots of slots including penny slots. Two blackjack tables, a 3 card poker table, and 2 roulette tables in which one was always very busy, and rarely did they open the 2nd even if there were people standing around wanting to play. I think the casino opens at 11 am and closes at 4 am. There was entertainment in the bar/casino area Fri-Sun nights. Good, but most songs were popular hits only in PR. Taxi's are always available but pricey, and you can pay for valet parking for $20 day. There's a free business office to use the internet (2 computers) and free use of the printer. There's a grocery store and other shops a block away. Ponderosa is also close by. There's also plenty of hotels in the area within walking distance that have casinos. The Intercontinental has beautiful grounds, a good casino and a Japanese steakhouse that we heard was very good. All in all, I'd give this hotel 3 stars.

Upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile at the front desk and given a room on the 7th floor overlooking the freeflowing outdoor pool. The room was typical Embassy Suites with a separate living room area, microwave, fridge and 2 TVs and pull out sofa. This is a good choice if you are travelling with teens, it felt like we had joining separate rooms. The rooms were spotless every day, the housekeeping staff does a good job keeping them above standards supplying us with good PR coffee and the usual amenities. Breakfast: Served 6:30-9:30am weekdays, weekends 7:30-10:30am. Never thought there was a problem with the lines, we were usually there @ 8am and they moved very quickly. Good MTO omelettes. Lots of fruit and yogurt too!! Managers Cocktail reception: 5:30pm-7:30pm, the chardonnay was served chilled in glass and there was no problem getting 2 drinks each time. Again there was a line at times but I didn't think the wait was long, the bartenders were quick and efficient. Hotel Restaurant: Loved the shrimp and linquine! The restaurant supervisor arranged to have a cake for my daughters & husbands birthdays. It was a delicious chocolatecake topped with fresh strawberries. The hotel chef is a great singer btw, thanks again! Casino: We walked through lost 5 dollars in a 5 minutes and that is about all I can say. There seemed to be a lot of people playing the machines, its small but I think it was a good size for the hotel. Hotel Pool: Loved the waterfalls and the water temperature was perfect. Lots of chairs and towels so no problem no matter what time of day you use it. The beach pool bar wasn't always open but you can go inside if you want lunch or a drink. Beach: The walk to the beach is less than 10 minutes it was far shorter than I thought. I brought a small cooler from home and we would buy beer, sodas and water at the supermarket before you cross the street to the beach. Chair rentals are $4.00, it never semed busy the 2 days we spent there. The water was very warm and slight breeze, very pleasant and clean. Old San Juan: I had to mention this since this was best part of our trip, the day we spent visiting the Forts and walking around the streets. I thought it was a great tip catching the bus A5 one block from the hotel across from the supermarket, its usually 75cents but it was free. It was crowded and took over 1/2 hour to get to main terminal but a really fun experience. The locals obviously could tell we were tourists and offered their help and we really enjoyed talking to the them. My kids were able to talk to the locals far easier than I could but my high school Spanish did come in handy. Use the free open air trolleys once you exit the bus terminal to take you to the forts, it was very hot and bring water. Overall Embassy Suites is a business hotel but probably 25% of the guests were families vacationing. Its a nice choice for us since we don't need to be directly on the beach and did like the extras they provided. The hotel staff we found very friendly and always asked how our visit was,if there was anything they can do for us. We liked the convenience near the airport and never could hear the planes in the rooms.

My husband and I are not really the pampered sort\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we usually are able to go along and have a great time, despite slightly negative reviews (i.e. budget hotels in Italy). However, possibly the negative reviews regarding this hotel should be heeded. Thinking that this is a Hilton-owned, we figured we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too bad off. We even booked our stay and the accompanying flight off of Hilton.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vacation package leg. But once we got to the hotel, they seemed to have cancelled our reservation because they rudely told me that we were a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no-show\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (we had a late flight and it ended up being slightly delayed). First off, it showed that we already prepaid for our stay so it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have mattered when we showed up. Anyhow, we were dead tired and we just needed to crash first, so we needed the room. Since they had cancelled us before finally getting a manager to reinstate us, all they had available were smoking rooms. Fatigue set in and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue, so we took it, but we told them that we needed to switch rooms after others checked out. They said it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem, which they kept to their word, and later that afternoon before we left, we stopped by the front desk to change keys and they moved our luggage into the new room for us. When we came back, they left a fruit plate and a bottle of red wine along with a note apologizing for our inconvenience, which was nice. The lay out of the suite in general was nice, with a living area with a pull out sleeper couch, dining table, mini fridge and microwave, bar sink. The bedroom was a good size for walking around in without bumping into furniture. Bathrooms were standard. I liked the curved shower curtain rod that prevented the shower curtain from sticking to me as I showered. Amenities we used at the hotel: Breakfast: the signature Embassy Suites cooked to order breakfast was fantastic\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6omelets, pancakes, French toast. Most of the time though, there were so many people, so a few of the days we just opted to eat the items from the self-service bar (scrambled eggs, sausage, corned beef hash) and fruit (pineapple, melon, cantaloupe, bananas, apples). They also had sweet corn grits (wonderful) or oatmeal (not so great), as well as single serve yogurts. Outback Steakhouse: really good\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6standard restaurant, but convenient when we had a long day and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go back out for dinner. The churrasco (skirt steak) was really good. Our server was fantastic as well. Manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cocktail hour: one free alcoholic drink per person. The line was really long as well, but my husband pre-tipped the bartender and our drinks came out strong. Also had popcorn, chips, and other snack food. Parking: Self parking that was $12-14 Casino: although small, it provided us with a few late nights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of entertainment. They have a few tables each of poker, blackjack, and roulette. They have penny, nickel, and quarter slots. My husband and I found a video slot machine that we enjoyed when we were in Vegas so we were excited about that. The servers brought alcohol around as long as you tip (make sure you tip each time a dollar or so or they seem to disappear). They also have soup and grilled ham and cheese sandwiches in the late evenings so be sure to ask for those (and tip!) Pool: we sat by the pool but never went in. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed (probably because the beach is only a few blocks away!). Lots of kids and teenagers running around. They had a masseuse cabana available for massages poolside which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m disappointed that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a chance to try. Casino bar: the afternoon that we hung out by the pool, we decided to order food, but were told we had to re-enter the hotel to order at the casino bar as take out to bring out. The woman who took our order at the bar was very rude, basically ignoring us when we first got there. She could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve written down our order but instead, she forgot it and had to yell for us to repeat it once she got to the register. Then after waiting twenty minutes for two sandwiches, we found out she put the order in wrong. When she finally got our sandwiches, she placed it on the counter and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us that it was ours. Ugh. By the time we ate our sandwiches which were grilled, they were lukewarm. We were extremely disappointed. She really ruined our afternoon. We ended up calling the general manager (the number on the comment card in the room) and got through and voiced our disappointment. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do it all trip, but I finally pulled the honeymoon card and told him that I had thought that after having my wedding at a fabulous Hilton and enjoying fantastic service, I should be able to expect having Hilton hospitality on my honeymoon as well. The general manager was very apologetic and stated to us that he will consider possibly retraining some of his staff. He asked if there was anything he could comp us on, but we told him that we just sincerely wanted to voice our opinion. (On the last night he sent us a bottle of champagne anyways, but said that it was a honeymoon gift.) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to add though, that it the general manager did make us feel like he cared about how our stay was going, which meant a lot to us. So our general conclusion with this Embassy Suites? I suppose that for a couple nights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stay (like a quick long weekend) it would be ok, but probably not for a special occasion. Now that we are recalling our memories, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as painful, but during what should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a great time, it was a bit of an inconvenience. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to add that as a general comment with regard to San Juan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tourist areas, for some reason, the hospitality isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really up to par with other destinations.

Isla Verde beach is a block and a half away, about a 5 minute walk. Wonderful, beautiful beach. So peaceful. Burgerking, Subway, Baskin Robbins are between the beach and the hotel if you are looking for cheaper food. Ponerosa is also right there. The Ouback in the hotel was nice, crowded but nice.

That is to say, with a nice center atrium, good breakfast, etc. It also has a small casino (if you're interested in that sort of thing, which I am not). The pool area is rather large, with a nice waterfall for the kids to play in. People complain about airplane noise because the hotel is right next to the airport, but honestly the only time I ever heard planes was sitting at the pool. Inside the hotel, you'd never know they were there. It is also an easy walk to the beach, where you can rent 2 chairs and an umbrella for $18. The attendants were reasonably courteous (it helps to speak Spanish though) and asked when we left if we were coming back. Another good feature about the location is that it is easily accessible to both Old San Juan and the eastern beach areas such as Fajardo. You must do the Fajardo bio bay tour - see my review of Laguna Grande - and it's about 1:15 drive. If you stayed in Old San Juan, it would be considerably longer, especially with traffic. The Carolina/Isla Verde area is nicely situated in the middle. One of the closest restaurants, which I cannot recommend highly enough, is the tiny Mi Casita that's right on the way to the beach. They have wonderful food, and excellent prices. It's very small but pleasant. The waiters speak English but with the busboys etc. it helps to be able to speak to them in Spanish. Order the mofongo: my wife had chicken and I had fried pork. The fried pork was rather dry, but between the sauce that comes with the mofongo and a good local Medalla beer, it is fine. The Metropol is another nearby restaurant with good local food, although we did not go there. The Bad: Not really bad, but the hotel does not really have much in the way of local feel. You could be at any other Embassy Suites hotel, and it would be just about the same. I think some of the smaller hotels in the area have much more of a Caribbean feel to them. We were only there for two days pre-cruise, but if you are there longer you may want more of a local experience at another hotel. Also, although the rooms were nice, for the high price I expected them to be a bit cleaner than they were. This seems to be an endemic problem with hotels in the area, however: and my guess is that the Embassy Suites is about as clean as you're going to get.

At the happy hour they would place one kid in line with a valid ID and then he would motion for 10 of his friends to join him when he got to the front. When other people objected, the poor girl who was at the line checking ID's tried to do something, but she seemed uncomfortable confronting the kids. They would press all the buttons in the elevator regardless of the floor and you then stopped on every floor.

I called and went down to the front desk a couple of times, but not much changed.

It was great! It was literally 4 minutes from the airport which made getting there and leaving very easy. There were 4 of us and the suite had more than enough room for 4 women and all of their things. The complimentary hot breakfast every morning was a great way to start the day and the manager's reception every evening was a great way to start the night. I highly recommend the \"San Juan Bombs\" from the singing bartender! Check in was fine after a bit of a wait and the room was clean. The only issue we had was getting enough towels - 4 women and 2 sets of towels is an issue and we had trouble getting the staff to understand that. The beach was a short walk from the hotel and along the way there is a little strip mall with almost everything you need. There's a grocery store, several restuarants - fast food and sit-down, and several other stores. The beach is gorgeous but make sure to rent a beach chair because as the day progresses there is more and more trash in the sand. The water is beautiful and the sunset was absolutely gorgeous. We took two excusions while we were there. I highly recommend the El Morro Fort tour. It's fun, historical and It's a great way to see Old San Juan as well. We also did the Bacardi \"Factory\" tour but that was pretty disappointing. Aside from the free drinks and cheaper prices in the gift shop, it's just a staged tour where you walk through a series of museum like rooms and listen to the narration of the tour guides. Security is off the hook to the point where you can't even walk from one area of the compound to another even though you can see where you are going. Instead you have to wait for the little train. Boo! I also HIGHLY recommend doing a tour of the El Yunque rainforest. It was absolutely gorgeous with lots of breathtaking views and worth the 30-45 minute ride each way. On one of the days we all decided to take the bus down to Old San Juan to walk around. For .75c you can't beat the price. Just ride the bus to the end of the line and you are there. It's a great way to see locals and the \"real\" San Juan. Overall I had a great time. It's beautiful there, the weather is beautiful and so are the people.

There was horrific noise in the 8-story atrium most nights, either from the local band at the bar or the large banquet parties booked every night.

There is a bus (A5) that runs all the way down the coast into Old San Juan for 75 cents, but the service is slow and erratic. It goes through 2 housing projects, which might scare some people, but I felt safe. If you are not going to take the bus, taxis are expensive. Most people say you should rent a car in San Juan, but the drivers don't follow right-of-way rules, and I'm glad I did not.

For six nights, we paid a little over $200 for the resort fee and parking, parking was $15 a day. We were aware of the fee from reading other reviews, so since it was expected, it was no big deal.

I realize that it may bother some people that it is so close to the airport, but it really did not affect us. We never lost any sleep over that or the music in the atrium. The 2 room suite was decent and very spacious. The buffet breakfast ( which is included) was also very good. We especially liked the fact that they make cooked to order eggs/omelettes. The 2 hour nightly manager's free happy hour was also a nice bonus considering the fact that you are staying at a hotel so they overprice the cocktails. It is a good idea to go to the supermarket and pick up your own beverages. You will save considerably. I am used to all-inclusive so it was tough for me to see that they were charging $5.00 for a beer. I am by no means cheap, just pratical. Also, I read reviews that stated the beach was about a ten minute walk??? The walk is about 5 minutes, possibly under. We went to the beach several times after laying by the pool which was extremely cold. The pool was our only disappointment. It was nice to look at and that's about it. I spent most of my time in the hot tub. There are many places to eat outside the hotel. If you like to walk you will find pleanty on the way. Fortunately, I traveled with people who know the island so we were able to hop in the car and go to different locations which is a huge plus. Also, the casino which is open until 4 A.M. is pretty small, but we did not have a problem with that. I believe we make our own vacations what they are ie. fun, romantic,quiet etc. It is a great hotel for the value. We would certainly stay there again in the future.

As we were checking in, I asked the non-interested clerk behind the desk how long the music would be going on, she shrugged and said 'they were almost done'...which translated to another few hours (i guess i should've asked for a clarification of \"island time\"). I explained that our luggage had been lost by American Airlines and they said we should inform the hotel so they would be on-hand to receive it, and instead of any sympathy or offer of toiletries, she again shrugged and said 'someone's always here'. We went to the bar in the lobby for a drink, and received the first one from a helpful waitress, but my husband had to go to the bar to get his second drink because the other waitress was too busy standing 2 feet from us talking to another person at the bar. I gave up on getting a second one after she walked by our table and ignored us and my empty glass the 3rd time (and I'm a VERY patient person). Casino was incredibly small and looked like part of it was under renovation. Suite and breakfast were usual for Embassy Suites...lots of room in the room and hit-or-miss food at the buffett (it was really busy and they had trouble replenishing the food to keep up). My husband bought toiletries in the hotel gift shop and was overcharged by $30 ($85 vs. $55 that it should have been), which he didn't realize until we were back home--seems the clerk there was operating on less sleep than we were. To be fair, the pool area looked nice and the bellstaff were very understanding and helpful. The other person behind the counter was very nice and promptly had toiletries sent to our room when I requested it.

We chose the Embassy Suites based on a combination of Trip Advisor reviews, the price, the location and the pool and hot tub. Overall, I can't say that we were unhappy with our stay, but we probably would stay somewhere else if we visited Puerto Rico again. We booked through the Hilton website and were quoted $170 per night before taxes, fees, parking etc. After taxes, fees, parking we ended up paying about $220 per night. I knew about the additional expenses in advance, so I wasn't surprised, it just starts to add up. Overall, we found travel in Puerto Rico to fairly expensive vs. the value. Most of the hotels seem to charge extra for parking ($14 per day) and include a 10% per day service charge. The best features of the Embassy Suites are the pool, the breakfast buffet, the manager's reception, the in-room fridge and the free wireless internet. Most of the staff was helpful, and we didn't have any trouble with the maid service. The lobby and courtyard were pretty and overall the hotel seemed to be clean and well-maintained. Our room was a nice size and it was nice to have the two separate areas, but the location of our room wasn't the best. The pool is pretty large, although the water is a little chilly. The hot tub is nice for a hotel. Also, the pool and hot tub were not super crowded when we were there. While in Puerto Rico, we found that the minimum that we spent for a meal was $30, the average was about $50 to $60 and the high end was over $100. Drinks run from about $4 to $5 for a beer to $10 for mixed drinks. That said the breakfast buffet and manager's reception, although not the best, probably saved us some money. Things to be improved upon are the on-site dining options and I wasn't thrilled with the location. We did not try either restaurant on-site, one of which is an Outback Steakhouse, but I heard from others that the food and service were not good. We also didn't spend any time at the casino, but it looked kind of small. The location of the hotel is ok. It is near the airport and some other nicer hotels (El San Juan and the Intercontinental). There is a beach a few blocks away. Carolina/Isla Verde feels fairly suburban and it seemed like there were a lot of business travelers in our hotel. There is a strip that you can walk along that has a few restaurants and there is good access to the highway. Old San Juan is about a 15 minute drive from the hotel. We went to the San Juan Hotel and Casino on a Saturday night and had a lot of fun, there seemed to be a lot of local people there. During my initial search, I couldn't find a hotel in our price range (under $200) in Old San Juan that had the amenities that we were looking for (pool and hot tub). Plus, once we saw Old San Juan, it seems like it might have been pretty noisy to stay in a hotel there. Our other choice was the Marriott, which was slightly more expensive and in Ocean Park. The area around the Marriott was under construction, but the Marriott itself looked nice, is closer to Old San Juan and had some more upscale shopping. We probably would have had a different experience if we stayed in another area, next time if we return we would probably try the Marriott. Again, not a bad experience, just nothing that stands out as great. We also went inside the Holiday Inn, the Intercontinental, El San Juan and El Convento. All were nice, El San Juan seemed to be the most happening, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem as nice as the Intercontinental. El Convento was in a good location and really pretty.

The room was very very nice it had two sections one which had 2 full suized beds, tv and the other room had a table couce bed tv and wet bar. The room was very clean and alothough our view was the room it still did not matter as we were not there to look out our window. The only complaint is that the our toilt got clogged three times lol. The hotel was super clean and nice on the inside and was beautifully decorated with all types of vegitation. It had a nice pool area with water fall and a snack bar out there as well. Alothough this hotel is close to the air port and you can hear planes going by, it never bothered us its not that loud at all. The best thing i liked about this place is they have a Happy hour from 5-7pm everyday where all house wines, beers, and mixed drinks are free. I really liked this as we drank up from 5-7 and did not have to spend much on booze when we went out after wards. At some times there was along line, but we never waited more than 5-7 mins. And they let you get as many cups as you want so i usually got 3 at a time so i did not have to keep going back up there. This place is not located on the beach but again that was not a problem for us as it was a 5 min straight walk down the beach. The beach is really nice and we did not not see any sea weed. The water is a pretty blue color and feels really nice. There are many places to eat nearby the hotel within a 5 mins walk such as Subway, Toca Bell, Wendys, KFC, we did not see a mc donalds nearby though. While we were there we went to the Rain Forest which was really nice. We did not go on a group tour we rented a driver and told him to drop us off and then be waiting for us where we exited. We liked this a lot because we were told that the tour guides will rush you and not like you spend time in the water falls ect.. We got to take our time to look at what we wanted to and swim at all the spots during the path. It was really nice. I highly suggest the Rain Forest. We also did the BIO BAY Tour this was alright not the greatest we could see the things glowing but not that well as it was a full moon. If you do this Make sure u do it when there is little or no moon out otherwise it will not be that great. We also took the city bus off Isle Verde Ave for $1 to old san juan to see the two castles and explore around. This was really nice. You can walk inside almost every room of the castles and look at everything this is a must do, if you ask me. Overall we really liked this hotel and its location to everything, o and i almost forgot the hotel is near tons and tons of night clubs and bars within walking distance. so if you like to go to clubs like we did this is the spot to stay. tons of clubs on ise verde ave. There is also a huge super market about 2 blocks from the hotel that sells everything its kinda like a Kmart.

As others have said, it can be tricky to find if you're driving yourself, but once you get your bearings, it's not so bad. We arrived hours before check-in, and although we couldn't get into our room, the hotel stored our baggage so we could go exploring. Once we got into our room, we weren't disappointed... It was a 2-room suite with more than enough room for us and our 6 year old daughter (who was thrilled to have her own room and tv). The room was very clean and looked pretty new. The bed had a fitted sheet on it, which I always like to see in hotels (hate how the flat ones can come off during the night). Our room overlooked the pool (and the highway, which is RIGHT next to the pool), but while I worried about noise from planes or traffic, there was NONE! The same can't be said about noise from INSIDE the hotel. Our first night there (a Sunday), there was a singer and music in the lobby that we heard plain as day in our room. The good thing was, it was over by about 9:30, and after that, all was quiet. The breakfast in the morning offered tons of choices, from omelettes to pancakes to cereal. Something for everyone. Our first morning there was very rainy, and that may have led to the REALLY long breakfast lines. It literally took us 25 minutes to get our food. Yikes! The second morning, though, there was practically no line. Go figure... It would be nice to have the breakfast open later than just 9:30. Seems kind of early for a hotel that has a lot of tourists as guests. Our only real problem with the hotel was that our room was never made up on our full day there. We'd left the hotel at around 9:30 and got back at 3. The room hadn't been touched. Went to the pool for another 2 hours; still nothing. We got a a call at around 5:30 asking if we'd like for them to make up the room for us. At that point, we figured why bother, and just asked for new towels. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel.

I stayed here with 20 family members and we loved it. Having stayed at the El San Juan down the street which is an upscale hotel, I liked this hotel much better, especially traveling with children. The suites were very spacious and very clean. We had a view of the pool which was great and although planes are landing all day long, you cannot hear the planes from your room. The breakfast every morning was a great money saver as well as the managers reception every evening with top notch liquor. Great food and great drinks.....can't beat it!! We ate at Mi Casita which I've eaten at before, the first night the food was WONDERFUL, it was true island food, but our second visit was not as good, there must have been different cooks. Also be ready for slow service at the resaurants and also read your bill before tipping as most restaurants charge 15% gratuity no matter how small the party. We also ate at Levi's at the end of the strip which had good service and food was okay. If your in the mood for fast puerto rican food at a good price, try the Pollo Tropical, also down at the end of the strip. One thing visitors to the Embassy Suites should watch out for is their final bill. The hotel charges you for a 9% hotel fee which includes local calls. Having family in Puerto Rico I did make some calls and also called down to the desk before calling to confirm they were free because of the 9%, I was still billed for each call 1.25 plus tax. So make sure to check your bill, the front desk took it off, but make sure to check and not be overcharged. There were also about 2 proms while we were there,but did not bother us at all, we were on the 4th floor and our room was over the prom area...but again no problems.

The thing that I find ridiculous about the rate is they quote you one price but you will end up paying quite a bit more after they tack on all the various taxes and fees (Puerto Rico LOVES fees, fees for EVERYTHING!!!) even the valet parking added taxes and \"fees\" to their $16.00 per night (ended up costing $23.00 without a tip) The bellhop sat there looking bored while we struggled with our bags, never offering to help two ladies upon check in. We just blew it off and went to our room. The room itself was fine, okay but we were tucked away at the very back of a wing away from any sort of view that would have made the stay a little nicer. We ordered room service (again, fees fees fees + a delivery charge) and the tray was still sitting outside our room the next day when we checked out. There were room service trays outside many of the doors throughout the hotel during our stay that never moved. It was gross really. Now for the best part, the CASINO staff is really rude, be prepared. We went in to the casino to waste some time and money after a great dinner at Ruth Chris Steak House (recommended highly) and we spent about $300 on slots in the course of several hours before we were offered a drink. I had asked 5 different waitress/wait staff people where I could BUY a drink and they each told me it was someone else's responsibility. So after 2 hours we finally got our drinks and proceeded to gamble. It was my 19 year old daughter's first opportunity to gamble (gambling/drinking age in Puerto Rico is 18) so she was excited and I wanted to take a photo of her pulling the slots...mind you, I had NO idea photography was not allowed in the Casino, there were NO signs anywhere stating this and since I don't normally hang out in casinos, I did not know this was typical for casinos. Well, I took out my pocket camera and started to take a photo of my daughter. A staff member (janitor) came up and smiled at us and said in extremely broken english (I could not begin to understand what he said at all) what I *thought* was \"oh this is a good place for a picture, isn't it?\" and I smiled and said \"yes it is\" he then started waving his hands around and SCREAMED inches from my face still unintelligible but enough for me to understand this time what he was trying to get across....\"NO PICTURE, UNDERSTAND!!!!\" I was stunned and embarrassed. There was NO need to scream at me, I did not understand what he had said originally and since he was smiling when he said it, how was I to know that he was indicating I was doing something wrong. I hate being made to feel stupid, especially by the casino janitor in broken english. This obviously ruined our night. We went to the Hotel Manager and were told there was nothing he could do about it since it happened in the Casino. We went to see the Casino Manager and were told to wait for him, that he was busy. We waited (ignored) for over 40 minutes before we decided to just forget it. I can't believe we were treated so badly and paid all that money to Embassy Suites to get that sort of treatment.

Visiting Puerto Rico was a first for all of us, so that is why we chose to vacation in PR. And we all agree it was a great choice. The Embassy Suites worked out perfect for us. We booked 2 suites, so each of us had our own bed and only had to share a bathroom with one other person instead of 3 other people. Well worth the extra money spent. The separate living room area worked out perfect for getting ready for dinner and relaxing. The bedroom was very spacious and comfortable. The complimentary breakfasts were fine. Some food items better than others, but you can't really complain when you don't have to leave the hotel and it is included with your room. The nightly manager's cocktail party was definitely worth visiting each night. They gave you 2 drinks each time you went up and the lines moved pretty quickly. The bartenders were friendly and gave heavy pours! Always a huge plus! One thing we did learn is when ordering a hamburger from the Atrium Restaurant, make sure you order it well not medium well because ours was still raw. The pool area was great. While we were there hardly anyone used the pool, so you always had your choice of spots to lay in the sun by the pool. Although we never actually saw the pool bar open, which would have been a nice to have been able to order a cool beverage by the pool, but we survived without them. The beach is a quick 5 minute walk from the hotel. And the majority of the restaurants and bars are very close as well. We walked at night to and from the hotel and never felt unsafe in the area. (I don't condone walking around at night, because crime still does happen, but we never felt nervous.) Some of the best bars we visited were the lounges and nightclub at the El San Juan Hotel. Very fun and lively. Definitely check this place out and dress accordingly. Pretty upscale but beautiful, especially the bordello salon. Club Liquid at the Beach & Water Club Hotel was a nice place as well. It is on the rooftop. Very pretty skyline and beach view. We visited Old San Juan which was incredibly beautiful.

We had a very nice room which overlooked the pool. However, I think this will probably be our last stay at this property and in San Juan in general. Hotel: The breakfast, which was so fabulous last year, has taken a step back. They used to make omelettes in omelette pans and they were great. Now, they make them on the grill, using cylinders to keep them round. Well, I ordered two, and each time the outside of the omelette came out overcooked and the inside was raw. Additionally, it was amazing how many times the cooks made mistakes as to who had ordered which omelette. It was like they had never worked at this job before. Also, the lines were very long each and every morning. The cocktail reception in the evening, always a nice plus, has also taken a step back. No longer will they make blender drinks, as in the past. Additionally, like the breakfast, the lines are very long. The pool is very nice. However, the surface outside the pool is inexplicably slippery and dangerous. I mean, who would construct a pool like that? Time and time again, I saw people, especially little children, fall. Some toddlers even fell back, banging their heads. If you have little children, you must stay on top of them and insure they don't run (very difficult to do with kids). I'd be willing to bet, sadly, that this pool has seen its share of serious accidents. Also, there is no lifeguard, which is a shame. The location of the hotel is not great, but we knew that going in. It is about a ten minute walk to the beach (straight ahead). On the way to the beach is \"mall\" on Avenue Isle Verde. Just be careful, when walking with small children, of the metal spikes that line the sidewalk and the entrance to the parking lot to the mall (another construction decision that I fail to understand). Staff: This is the most perplexing part of this hotel and of Puerto Rican people in general. I don't know if it's an aloofness, language miscommunication, or intelligence issue. But, the service was not very attentive, and mistakes and misinformation permeated our stay. Examples: Me: \"Do you have to pay for children on the bus?\" Front Desk: \"I don't know, I don't have any children;\" and Me: \"What have you heard about the Asian restaurant next door in the Holiday Inn?\" Front Desk: \"I have never eaten there;\" and Me: \"What time does the pool bar close (question asked at 3:40 pm)?\" Pool Bar Bartender taking my order: \"3 pm;\" and Me: \"How long does it take to get to the Condado using the bus (a 3 mile trip)?\" Bellhop: \"Over one hour.\" Me: \"But, it's such a short trip.\" Bellhop: \"The bus makes lots of stops.\" There are many more examples. A waitress in the Outback Steakhouse (inside the hotel) was rude and incompetent. She brought the wrong order, took 20 minutes to bring our dessert, and made us wait another 20 minutes to get the check. All of this without an apology. Also, the service at the fast food restaurants in the mall is not only very slow (1/2 hour just to get some chicken at Church's), but also inept. The orders there and everywhere were wrong every time. The casino staff was also not very pleasant and unprofessional. A blackjack dealer misdealt a hand and the Pit Boss just got rid of the cards instead of making things right. No \"sorry\" or even an acknowledgment that the players were wronged. Same situation at El San Juan Hotel. The blackjack table decides to change the minimum from $10 to $25. So what do they do? Grandfather the players already gambling? Of course not. Just kick everyone off of the table! Be aware, that even though English may be an official language of the territory, and many service people allegedly \"speak and understand English,\" Spanish is what's spoken in Puerto Rico. Learn some Spanish before you go. Misc. Notes: There is an excellent supermarket called Pueblo, just a short walk from the hotel. When leaving the hotel, make a sharp right and walk along the highway exit and then make a left at the corner. Pueblo is great for stocking your fridge with drinks, lunch foods, and snacks. Why pay the high prices of the hotel? Get a small, soft cooler and you will be able to keep your drinks cold while at the pool or beach. The Asian restaurant next door at the Holiday Inn is excellent. It's a bit pricey, but the food is great and the service, unlike everywhere else, was outstanding. Also, Metropol, for authentic Puerto Rican and Cuban food, is nice. It has a kid's menu, is reasonable, and you eat among locals, which is great. While nothing fancy, it is worth a visit. Make a right on Avenue Isle Verde and walk down about 1/2 mile, just past the cock fighting arena. Conclusion: As I stated earlier, this may be our last trip to San Juan. It is an easy flight and inexpensive, which makes it attractive. But, we were in search for beauty. I've been told that Puerto Rico has some beautiful beaches. Well, those beaches do not exist in San Juan. The beach on the Condado is not nice. Isle Verde Beach, which many guidebooks say is beautiful, is not that at all. Isle Verde beach has lots of pollution in its sands. When we were there, there was an influx of seaweed. While I'm sure the seaweed isn't always present, the debris from the sand doesn't go away. The beach is mediocre because of the debris. I'm hoping that in other parts of Puerto Rico, Rincon for example, the beaches are as they are pictured and described in the guidebooks. That is why, if I come back to Puerto Rico, while I may fly into San Juan, I'm renting a car and searching for some real beauty, because the beauty is not in San Juan.", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cvery satisfied\u201d", "Author": "Chicagojill", "ReviewID": "UR7405376", "Content": "Just returned from a girls' trip to Puerto Rico.

The hotel its self was decent.. .nothing spectacular, but no problems. We paid 359 per night... for a suite which housed 5 people easily. There were two full sized beds in the bedroom and one pullout sofa in the living roon. The breakfast buffet is a must with eggs, bacon, sausage, and all the fixins. there is even an omlette bar where you pick your own ingredients. The hotel is very close to the airport, but i didn't here one plane go by, even though i can see the planes from my room window. The cost for taxi from the airport to the hotel should be 12 bucks... unless you have 4+ people. the cost to cab it to old san juan was 20 one way. The hotel pool was good... but there was no beach that it leads onto. The hotel is about 1.5 blocks from the beach..... so no direct access from the hotel. The hotel did have a casino which i didn't use much so i can't comment on it... but drinks are free if you play at the tables for some length of time. There was an outback steakhouse in the hotel which was good to see after a very disapointing outing at a local restaurant where i tried th Mofongo.... which believe me sounds a lot better than it is. One thing that i recommend everyone to do before they leave is goto the rainforest and stop by the Bio Bay in Frajoda(sp). We went there on a boat with 16 in the group. When we first got there it wasn't much of a site.. until you get into the water....I'm not much of a swimmer, but i put on a life vest and ventured into the darkness ... the further away from the boat i got.. the more intense the glo was...it was one of the most AMAZING things that i have ever seen. Make sure you go there late at night... We didn't actually jump into the lake until about 11:00 pm. But it is a must for anyone coming to PR. They have other bio bay's around PR, but the one in Frajoda was the closest... and we were able to go there right after the rainforest. The water was said to have 4x the salt concentration as the ocean, so not much was living in the lake besides the glo organisms. A plus for you ladies... and men also is that your skin will be baby soft after you wash off the salt remains. by the way .. the photos above are pretty good representations of the hotel", "Date": "March 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis", "Title": "\u201cRewarding experience\u201d", "Author": "Decorte", "ReviewID": "UR7153927", "Content": "We stayed four nights in early March 2007.

The Ritz-Carlton, which is just a few blocks away, offers a Friday night seafood buffet that can't be beat. It's a bit pricey but well worth the expenditure. Another excellent restaurant in the neighborhood is the Metropol; also just a few blocks away.

The free-form pool with waterfall is attractive, spotless and seldom crowded. There's a separate kiddie pool and hot tub. For the same price as most of the hotels in this area, you get the extra space and the breakfast. If location is the key, you have it here. The hotel is minutes away from the airport (taxi fee of $10) and a 2 short block walk to one of San Juan's nicest beaches--Isla Verde. For dining, an Outback in the hotel lobby offers reasonably priced meals while the neighborhood includes numerous fast food restaurants (McDonalds, Wendys, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Ponderosa, etc). The other hotels in walking distance provide other fine dining options, including a Palm Steakhouse and a Ruth Chris. The adjacent Holiday Inn offers an expensive but creative Italian restaurant. There are some neighborhood bars as well. You will also find a major grocery store around the east side and a Walgreens on the west. A Dollar car rental is located on the same street. We appreciate having the two rooms for the flexibility that gives us with family members who like different sleeping times or different movies etc. As with all ES locations, the room includes two TVs, phones, a microwave and refrigerator. We always choose a 2-bed room but that means two double beds, not two queens, which can be cramped for some couples. The rooms with 2-beds are a bit larger in floor space. For the largest rooms, ask for the -11 number or the -17, as in 617 or 611. The bathroom is a reasonable size. Each suite has a small closet but not much drawer space. The casino and nightly entertainment can be loud (the hotel has an open atrium design) if you go to sleep before midnight, especially if someone sleeps in the living room. Request a room on an upper floor away from the front entrance (again the -11 room is a good choice). The grounds are minimal, really just the pool area. But it's always been enough for us. We usually spend part of the day at the pool and the other walking the beach. You can take a taxi to Old San Juan for $16 or a public bus for about $1 each way. My only negative is a problem I had with my \"loyalty\" points (Hilton Honors). Because I booked the this reservations at Cheaptickets rather than Hilton.com, I was not awarded any points for this stay. The price wasn't any less so I really lost out.

We stayed here from Oct. 6-8. I am extremely satisfied with my stay here and paying attention to the reviews was well worth it. It is a 3-4 min ride from the Airport. Lobby is beautiful with a rainforest atmosphere. The atrium style setting of trees and small waterfalls is very relaxing. Pool in the back is nice with a jacuzzi and kids pool. And although the highway is behind the pool, it didn't bother us at all. Its kind of hidden by all of the trees. Also, we only heard like 2 airplanes our whole stay-but after living in New York, who cares! Breakfast is just as other reviews said; satisfying with all breads, juices, tea, coffee, cereals, fruits, and regular fare, as well as made to order omelets, waffles and pancakes. Yes, definitly get there between 7:30-8:30 because after that it does get crowded-towards the end, you may not even be able to find a seat, and there are plenty of seats! We ate enough every day last until dinner. Internet is $9.95 per day, so if you need to use it, make sure you understand it will be charged to your room or credit card. Live music nightly and just a walk to a local Ponderosa, Mi Casita & the other resort/hotels on the strip, plus a grocery store. We stocked up on water and fruits. Having the fridge and microwave is a big plus. For your El Yunque tour, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Rafael from PR 4 LESS. Ask Bo, or the other managers/staff to hook you up with him. He really enjoys taking people through the island, and if you're hungry after, he'll take you to a real authentic PR roadside stand/restaurant to eat. That was one of the greatest parts of our trip. I will definitly return to Embassy Suites. Not only are the rooms/accomodations great for the price, but it felt like coming home every night. We moved over to the Ritz Carlton after our 2 nights here and although the Ritz is beautiful, probably best for honeymoon/anniversary vacations, the atmosphere is kind of stuffy with a lot of business people. Embassy has a very relaxed feel. There are a lot of families that stay here, and it is also a spot for locals on the weekends. The staff is not afraid to talk to you, and smile at you, and for that we can't wait to go back.", "Date": "October 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "White Plains, New York", "Title": "\u201cIt had everything we needed!\u201d", "Author": "LiamsMommy", "ReviewID": "UR5954307", "Content": "Thanks to everybody who took the time to review this place. I read all of your reviews and took a lot of the advice I found here. My husband and our 3 year old son stayed at this property from October 6th - October 11th and we had a great time. We arrived way before check-in time and she said she had some rooms available but I told her that I wanted the quietest room available so my son could sleep. We were given room 722 which was in a corner overlooking the pool and the expressway. Some of the negatives that were mentioned in previous reviews are true. Yes - The hotel is located next to the airport but we didn't hear the planes too much when we were in our room. You can hear the planes land from the pool area but it didn't bother us too much. Yes - The pool area is right next to an off-ramp of a highway but it's camoflauged by palm trees. We live in a city so we are used to the sounds of cars going by. Yes - The hotel has a salsa singer every night from 6:00pm on and the atrium amplifies the noise. We could hear her singing on the 7th floor in our sitting area but when we went into the bedroom and closed the door we couldn't hear it anymore. For the price and everything you get we were really happy with the hot and cold selections at breakfast and we LOVED the happy hour. I'm guessing that during the busy season the lines could get REALLY long but it wasn't that way for us. On two nights we got Outback Steakhouse takeout and had dinner in the bar area while enjoying the happy hour. We are not really beach people but we walked to it twice. I would say that it's a three block walk and you do have to cross one busy street but that cars will stop. The Pueblo supermarket was a five minute walk and was just like the markets at home but even nicer. As there's a mini-fridge and microwave in the room you can really stock up. A lot of reviews mentioned Mi Casita restaurant my husband liked it but I liked the Metropol restaurant more. (I think my husband liked that Mi Casita was less expensive) The pool area itself was nicely landscaped and laid out but it could have been cleaner. My son is an early riser so often we'd be down at the pool at 7:00am and there would still be debris from the previous evening still outside. That's my one gripe about the property. One day we had to wait an hour for fresh pool towels. Our family had a wonderful time and agreed that a 5 or 6 day stay was a perfect amount of time as the hotel is on the smallish side. Hope this helps!

It is about 1/2 mile and 10 minute taxi ride from the San Juan airport. First off I will mention that the hotel is nice and very clean. It has an attractive lobby and pool (you are near the airport but the noise of landing jets really isn't an issue). However this hotel is not without problems. The hotel does offer free internet access (as mentioned on their website) and there are three free interent kiosks near the check in desk. However, at least one of them was always out of order and the other two were constantly being used. My biggest complaint with the hotel is their handling of crowds. As mentioned we stayed there on a Saturday evening and the hotel was extremely crowded. The receptionist informed us that Saturdays are always busy because the \"pre-cruise\" crowd. (Apparently, a good number of customers stay in this hotel one night prior to their sailing date.) While the managers reception and cooked to order breakfast have always been some of the best things about the Embassy Suites we've stayed at - these are poorly handled at this one. First off the manager's reception. This hotel has a rule that there is a 2 drink maximum per bar visit. This is a problem if you have small children and your spouse has to stay with them while you wait in line for the drinks. The bar tender told me that I could come back for additional drinks, but the line was long and the wait was about 20 minutes. Also, the drinks are served in small palstic cups which don't tend to last very long. I think that, with additional bar tenders and a little more efficiency (larger cups??) the wait time could be drastically reduced. The same thing happened at breakfast. Very long lines (especailly if you wanted cooked to order foods). The wait was again about 20 minutes and finding a place to eat was a challenge. Finally, we asked for late check out on Sunday morning. Being an Hilton Honors member I've never been denied this request. However, this time I was. After having to prod for a reason why this request wasn't honored, the management finally told me that they had another large group checking in and needed to get all of the rooms ready. They did offer to store my luggage but we needed to do laundry so that wasn't much help. We tend to stay at Embassy Suites when we travel.

The rooms are clean and well kept. The hotel staff is very helpful with any needs you have, even in making suggestions on what to do or where to go. The Embassy Grill located in the lobby of the hotel has excellent food and pricing was not bad either. Coming from NY I thought the meals was reasonably priced. Even room service was excellent. Many consider the rooms pricing, but with the inclusion of an amazing breakfast each morning and nightly managers reception including free drinks, it is well worth it. The lobby is beautiful with trees, greenery, water, the feeling of being outdoors. The pool area is clean and well maintained, pool towels available and even food service. Only complaint was the Outback restaruant located in the hotel a bit pricey for food that was nothing to rave about, especially when you ask for well done steak and it is totally pick, and then you are further insulted when someone comes out from the kitchen and tells you that is the color it is suppose to look, it really is cooked. You would think they would offer you at least a soda on the house. Service there was also very poor. Too many difference people servicing on table. Also long wait to get in and no reservations taken.

They hotel is definitely a treat to the eyes. My kids were mesmorized by the Atrium. It's like a small rainforest with bridges and creeks, shrubbery and trees. I even think there was a coqui hiding in there somewhere, although that could have been a hidden speaker putting out coqui sounds. I like the fact that they had a small kiosk area adjacent to the main entrance where they had a few stations for internet access - 3 around a small tower, 2 at desks. The only problem was that at times 3 of the stations had technical problems so I ended up waiting a few times to get online - not a big deal. Our party had a 2 bedroom suite and another 1 bedroom suite and the hotel was happy to put us in adjacent suites. Although we had requested non-smoking, I think we got smoking suites because both had ashtrays and the 1 bedroom had a strong smoke/cleaner product smell when we checked in. Either we got used to it or the cleaner worked because we didn't notice it after the 1st day. The suites were very nice and clean, and the mattresses looked new and were very comfortable. Our suites were thoroughly cleaned promptly in the AM every day - enough so that I felt compelled to leave a tip for the attendants - which I rarely do. Other than the cable cutting out a few times, we had no issues during our stay. The free cook-to-order daily breakfast was really good. Just be sure not to get down there too close to the ending time, otherwise the line can be really long, but you will get served. Also, although the cooks were good, just check your order as they had a tendency to get the orders mixed up. They had no issue correcting it for us quickly though. The nightly manager's reception (free drinks) was fantastic. Yes, the drinks were a little watered-down, but it was top shelf and you could get 2 at a time and go back as much as you wanted. Also, if you just ask nicely, the bartender will make your drink stronger. The Embassy restaurant food was OK and decently priced. The onsite OutBack was nice, but they messed up our orders (does nobody know what well-done means?!?!) They did however, reduce our bill and give us some free deserts to make up for it. The pool was fantastic and huge - yes, the airport and highway is right behind the back wall, but it was in no way a nuisance unless you are anal about such things. I noticed a few planes landing, but the only time I was bothered was the 1 time a plane took off from that closest runway. Also, there was no device to turn on the bubbles in the jacuzzi. You can also order food and drinks from the pool area. The beach is 2 long blocks (maybe 1/10 th mile) away and you have to cross 1 busy street. I am from NY so crossing busy streets is no big deal for me, but just be careful and you'll be fine - not that big a deal. The staff was really friendly and helpful and gave us tips on nightlife and sight-seeing. We ended up using the Avis hotline to rent a minivan - Charlie's and other local rental places were all out of minivans. NOTE: be very wary of using directions from the hotel front desk to get around. They were very lacking and half-done and we got repeatedly lost trying to find our way to Old San Juan and a little lost getting to El Yunque rainforest (great idea and you don't have to walk the trails if you don't want to). The good thing about staying at this hotel is that if you get lost, just follow any sign that says \"aeropuerto\" and you'll find your way back. I really wished I had brought my portable GPS with me. All in all, this hotel is definitely worth using again if I go back to PR. It was a little pricey, but depending on your party size, you save a good $50-$75 a day with the free breakfast and drinks. The 1 complaint I have is that you have to pay for parking even if you are a guest ($10 per day), which annoyed me being that the rooms weren't cheap. It's close enough to everything, the service was good, the place is really nice.

Although the hotel has both a restaurant and an Outback on premises there are many places to eat in the immediate vacinity. There is a very wide range of restaurants from fast food to American casual dining chains, to more expensive restaurants as well as local cuisine (try both the Metropol and Mi Casita for native fare). The hotel is a short walk from the beach and the neighborhood seemed both safe and busy. One day we took the local bus to Old San Juan and another day we rented a car for a trip to the rainforrest and Bacarardi Distillery.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay, and felt we got more than our money's worth. Here are some of the tips I have for anyone considering a stay here: Location in regards to the beach: The location is the tradeoff for the lower price you pay. It is two block to the beach. This is not bad, even for our family traveling with two younger children. We got quite good at packing our bags full so that we didn't forget anything and have to trek back to the hotel. They do rent lounge chairs and umbrellas at the Isla Verde/Carolina beach - $4 for chairs and $11 for umbrellas if I recall correctly. Just make sure to bring towels down to the beach with you (we snagged towels from the pool area and then returned them at the end of the day) The pool: We never heard any traffic from the road that ran behind the pool. We also sat out at the pool each night with our drinks and the traffic was never loud, nor did we have any trouble with the airport noise. Only negative was that the hot tub was broken while we were there. It was hot but no bubbles. Rooms: The key here is to know that some of the rooms are renovated and some are not. Obviously the renovated rooms are better. While we were there the hotel had finished the 7th and 8th floors and were working on the 6th. My suggestion is to ask for the highest floor possible. Also, we never had any problem with airplane noise in our room, nor with the music from the lobby. Again, location may be the key. We were on the 8th floor facing downtown/Old San Juan (overlooking the parking ramp). Breakfast and Manager's Reception: To us, these were the two best reasons to stay at this hotel. The breafast is excellent. They had make to order eggs (fried, omelets, etc), sausage, bacon, fruit, cereal, juice - you name it - and it is free. However, the best deal is the Manager's Reception each evening. From 5:30 to 7:30 they offer free drinks and snacks. You can get two drinks per person at a time, and you can return as many times as you want. The snacks were tortilla chips and salsa, pretzels, and popcorn. I especially enjoyed the strawberry daiquiris! Restaurants: We tried the Outback Steakhouse in the hotel and it was as good as any Outback we've ever eaten at. Yes, the line can be long but if you tell the hostess you are staying at the hotel they usually seat you immediately. We ate there on both a Thursay and a Saturday night and did not wait either night to be seated. Make sure to bring in one of your free drink from the Managers Reception (they always let us do this) and save the money on drinks. The location of the hotel is great as far as local restaurants go. There is just about every fast food chain within two blocks (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Wendys) We also tried Metropol and had the best dinner of our stay, and it only average $15 per person without drinks. There is also a large Peublo grocery store one block away that has all the necessities. Take advantage and stock the room fridge with soda and water - prices at the grocery store seemed to be about the same as mainland groceries. Taxis: We did not rent a car and instead took taxis everywhere. It was about $12 each way for 4 of us to get to and from the airport. It was about $22 each way to get to get to Old San Juan. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.

The beds are fine, the sofa bed is a bit uncomfortable and for one night was acceptable. The breakfasts were fine. Great coffee. The nightly manager party was fun with fruity drinks, and standard junk food of chips, pretzels, party mix and popcorn. The pool was lovely, I can't figure out what people were complaining about. I didn't see any missing tiles and I made a point of searching it out. One traveler said the pool area looked like a hurricane hit it. I can't figure that out either it was simply beautiful. Yes, you can hear the planes either taking off or landing depending on the direction of the wind. After awhile you get use to the sound and you don't notice the aircraft noise. The sounds of the kids screaming and yelling drown the noise out. I don't mind the sound of the kids, I simply put on my headphones and listen to music. It's not as bad as previous reviews write and I consider myself very sensitive to unnecessary noise. The beach is exactly 3 blocks away. One long block and two short. If you have very young kids, this might pose a logistical problem because you need to carry your towels/junk and hold onto kids. I have kids 14, 12,9, so it was no problem. Yes,one of the streets is a highly trafficed street and there is no traffic light. But if you enter the crosswalk the cars did stop for us. No, I wouldn't let the kids do this by themselves. I just don't trust them or the drivers. We walked to the beach and went banana boating which can be found in front of the ESJ hotel. At the same time other kids are on the beach and my kids made instant friends. This worked out well for us. The beach is public and you can rent the chairs for $3-$4 per chair depending where you stop. In front of the ESJ hotel the chairs are $3. This place is good for a short stay and the hotel is designed for business travelers. As we saw mostly flight attendants and business people. If you like the hustle and bustle of San Juan this a decent place. If you are looking for a peaceful surrounding and limited night life you should stay a resort such as the Hyatt in Dorado. The hotel staff is very accomodating and helpful.", "Date": "January 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leonia, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, great service, bad location.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4373341", "Content": "My boyfriend and I visited San Juan from july 23 through july 30. We had a wonderful time there! The pool was smaller than I had expected, and in the morning it gets a bit crowded. But nonetheless, it was still nice. The manager's reception was decent (they should have varied the snacks a bit) and the continental breakfast was also nice (they should have varied that one too.) The bar downstairs is on the small side, but we never had any trouble ordering drinks. The bartenders were so friendly and very genrous with their alcohol. I always managed to get a buzz on after a drink or two. =) But there are other bars and hotels nearby, so you can frequent those hotel bars too. The service was also excellent. Front desk, gift shop, room service, everyone. We especially liked the doorman who always entertained us while we were waiting for our cab. What I also thought was sweet was how he always remembered us and asked us how we enjoyed the trip or restaurant he recommended for us. Downside of the hotel was its location. The highway is a bit too close by the pool and traffic from the highway is loud when you're in the pool. But you can always visit the pools of other hotels and enjoy a day of tanning there. The beach is also pretty nearby, altho the walk to the beach might be somewhat of a pain It's only about 3~4 blocks but there's a busy street to cross before you get to the beach. Another thing some people might find inconvenient is the small casino. But if you're not in it for the gambling, that shouldnt be a problem. Dont forget to ask for the free grilled turkey and cheese sandwich at the casino! Whenever my boyfriend and I got hungry around 3 or 4 am, we'd walk over to the casino and ask for the free sandwiches. =) You should also go to some nearby restaurants. The raw oyster bar has a 2/1 special on drinks and shrimps and oysters on certain nights, so dont forget to visit there. There's also a mall that's about a 10 minute cab ride from the hotel. If you feel like being more cultural, take the bus into old san juan and look at the beautiful buildings and shop the little shops. There's always some sort of live music concert going on. And if you can, DO visit the El Yunque rainforest. My boyfriend and I climbed all the way to the top which took us about 4 hours to complete. (great exercise) But go early cause it gets dark. (My boyfriend and I almost got lost while on our way down.) Overall, my experience with Embassy Suites was fabulous!

The happy hour is a pleasant plus with very good drinks. The breakfast is also very good. My friend, Dick, enjoyed the casino and found the rules for blackjack highly favorable in part because of the ability to surrender. He was up $100+ after two nights. The wonderful pool is by a freeway, but it is largely screened by dense palms and the waterfall provides white noise to hush the traffic. The staff bends over backward to provide top-notch service. The fitness center is small, but adequate and a nice retreat. It is a straight two block walk to the magnificent Isla Verde beach. It is a one block walk to reasonable shops and a variety of restaurants. The Carolina/Isla Verde area is a very nice area. We rented a car at the adjacent Holiday Inn (Less than $38 total plus $14.75 for gas). I found the other drivers to be laid back and cortez/simpatico. We drove all over the city and old San Juan.

Each guest is entitled to free drinks and snacks (nachos and popcorn). Also, breakfast is complimentary and we were able to bring it up to our room. All you can eat & drink! The location of the hotel is very close to the airport. We paid $16.00 for a taxi to take all five of us to the hotel. The beach is about two blocks away and there are many restaurants nearby. You can find both American and traditional Puerto Rican food within walking distance. Isla Verde is known as a tourist spot and there are many hotels very close by. (I would recommend the Wyndam. Very nice and classy.) The Embassy has a lively atmostphere and has a salsa band that plays into the late evening. The casino is much smaller than I anticipated though. There is an Outback Steakhouse located inside the lobby area. We noticed many many locals dining there. The pool area is excellent and relaxing. There were, however, a couple of negatives about the Embassy. The hotel has an open atrium where the rooms are located on the sides. Because of the lay out, you could hear the band playing all night long. Also, the rooms had a \"musty\" smell to them. Other than that, the value was worth the price. If you want to stay in Old San Juan (about 20 minutes away) definitely stay at El Convento. La Fortaleza is within walking distance. Definitely visit El Yunke, but be prepared to walk and get some exercise. Go to Vieques or Culebra if you have the opportunity.

My boyfriend and I are already planning are trip next year, but next time it will be for 10 days, not seven!!! I emailed the manager ahead of time, and he was very accommodating on sending me information about the area and things to do. He also upgraded my room to ocean view at no additional charge!! We arrived on June 26th pretty late at 10:45pm. The hotel lobby was immaculate, and the hotel clerks were very friendly. The hotel suite is great; it really makes you feel at home having two rooms. As soon as we arrived, we immediately changed to go get something to eat. My boyfriend and I were insistent on trying Puerto Rican foods and not have any fast food. One thing I'd like to worn everyone about is that gratuity is included on most checks. We didn't realize this till around the third day and had already spent around $100 extra than we should have. That Sunday night we arrived we went to the Oyster Bar around 11:30pm. It is around 1 \u00c2\u00bd blocks from the hotel. The place was packed and they serve food to the wee hours of the night. We shared an order of beef empanadas which were $6.95 and quite filling between both of us. The salsa music that night was slamming and we saw a wide range of people, but mostly locals on that night. On Monday morning we hit the free breakfast buffet. Monday - Friday the buffet is from 6:30am - 9:30am, sat - Sun 7:30am - 10:30am. Weekends the buffet line is packed. They have cooked to order eggs, omelets, pancakes, french toast, bacon, sausage, grits, fresh fruit, cereal, bagels, croissants and toast. They also have an assortment of juices, milk and Puerto Rican coffee which is great. There was only day which I would complain, when the cook got my order wrong and had ham in my omelet. Other than that, breakfast everyday was great. If for some reason you over sleep and miss breakfast, check out Mi Casita near the beach around 1 1/2 blocks away from the hotel. Two of us with a big breakfast and waiter service came to $10.00. After breakfast we usually headed to the pool or ocean. The pool was immaculate and they provide beach towels for you. The beach is just a short walk away, and pretty clean. Everyone there was very friendly and we went for a lot of nice walks on the beach. The management reception from 5:30pm - 7:30pm was great! You can get two drinks at a time so you don't have to stand in the long line over and over. My suggestion is to ask for the drinks in plastic cups and sit by the pool. It is a lot less crowded there, plenty of seating, beautiful view, and music. They have nachos with salsa and cheese sauce, and hot popcorn for snacking with your drinks. There were many children there, so feel free to bring your kids for non-alcoholic drinks. Just be sure to tip around $1 or $2 for every round of drinks, and the bartenders will hook you up. We went to several places for dinner, but the place I would recommend the most is called Soleil Beach Club in Pinones. There phone number is 787-253-1033. Pinones is a small restaurant/ beach /bike trail area around a 5 minute drive from the hotel. Although it is not too far, you defiently need a ride there. If you call the restaurant, they will pick you up at no charge and take you back to the hotel. The food there was amazing!! We had lobster tail and shrimp with garlic sauce the first night. We also had an appetizeter of tostones with crab. It was great, and the service and view was amazing. I am including a pic of the lobster and shrimp from our first night. Try sitting on the upper floor where the view is even prettier. We ate there twice during our stay, and the other two dinners were also in Pinones were the view can not be beat. All three restaurants that we went to in Pinones had excellent food and service. When we were at Soliel a second time we met a nice couple on the ride there from Philly and hung out with them for a few days. We also met a famous salsa singer named India at Soliel; unfortunately we were out of film that day. We went on a few tours of Puerto Rico which I would highly recommend. We went on the Bacardi tour which was a lot of fun. You receive drink tickets for two free drinks per person, but the bartender said we could have more if we wanted. The tour is free, and the only thing we paid for was the taxi. We could have taken a publico for .25 cents, but didn't feel like being on a bus for that long. Our driver waited for us while we were on the tour, and then took us to Old San Juan. There we saw El Morro, viewed a museum on San Juan, checked out all the pretty buildings, and had lunch from a street vendor. El Morro was amazing, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re into history you will really enjoy this. We did this activity on a cloudy day so it wasn't too hot, because you will be walking alot. The next day we did a snorkeling trip from EastWind Cats. See the concierge in the hotel for a list of these snorkeling trips. They are very accommodating. If the concierge is not there, they have a nice touch screen computer to find restaurants and tours. All of the snorkeling trips were around the same price and included lunch, snorkeling and unlimited rum punch and pina coladas. They also served snacks and the service was great. We also went on a horseback riding trip at the foot hills of the rainforest. It was very beautiful, but very hot. You have to wear pants because you are horseback riding and it feels even hotter. To save money, we really only drank in the hotel at the manager's reception. We went to the local supermarket called Pueblo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and purchased alcohol to make our drinks in the room. We put them in plastic cups so that we could drink by the pool. We won 120.00 one night in the casino, but lost it the next day, so I guess we evened out. Late at night if you have the munchies and you are gambling you can get free grilled sandwiches in the casino, just ask. They are actually pretty good. My one and only complaint is that it is hard to get free drinks when your gambling, you have to hunt the servers down, and then you have to go through all this red tape which I didn't quite understand. If you ever get hungry late at night, there is a pizza restaurant called Pizza City near the Oyster Bar which serves alcohol and pizza 24 hours a day. Ask for the pizza with Chorizo. . . it is one of the best slices I ever had!! All and all, the hotel was great, lobby and pool beautiful, it was very clean and the service was great. We are already planning our next trip and plan to stay at the same place. We didn't get to see Bio-bay, Vieques, and a lot of other places which we wanted to see.
