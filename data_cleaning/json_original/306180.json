We arrived very early in Singapore at around 8.30am and plan to go Universal Studio Singapore on the same day. We appreciated the Inn staff for letting us to drop off our luggage in their store room first and we headed to USS for whole day. The Inn is basically a boutique-style hotel. We chose to stay in Standard Double Room for SGD110 per night inclusive of tax & service charges. The room is VERY small as you can hardly walk after you put your luggage on the floor. The furniture is old, some of the drawer and hangers are broken / spoiled already. Basic toiletries are provided which include towels, soaps and hair shampoo. No floor mat is provided!! >< The bed is ok as I can sleep soundly due to the long exhausted day in USS. The hotel surrounding is quiet at night, which can ensure you have good quality sleep. No breakfast and no bellboy to help you carry your luggage all the way up to 3rd floor. Generally, do not put too high expectations and you will be happy you have found a quite ok place to sleep and bath in Singapore. P/S: There is one Chinese dessert shop selling excellent Iced Durian Dessert on Temple Street. After walk out from The Inn, turn to your right and walk towards Mcdonalds. Somehow you will see a dessert shop on your left (one of the shoplot opposite Mcdonalds) which sell excellent desserts.

We knew of possible disruptions due to advertised renovations, which we never saw or heard in our 2 days there which was a blessing.

We did not want or need a TV, but it is part of the room and equipment level so it needs mentioning. 3rd floor room and stairs only so only good for the fit who can carry all your bags yourself.

Our rock had bed was great for me, but Hanny did not sleep at all, and strange as there are NO extra pillows.

When we arrived at the hotel, we checked in, (foolishly without looking at the room first) lugged our bags up the stairs (there was no lift) and to our dismay, tried to squeeze into a tiny room. The door couldn't even be opened all the way because it hit a desk that was in the door way. It had obviously been moved to make way for a stretcher bed. This certainly wasn't a family room! For $248 Sing. a night, with no breakfast or no swimming pool, we at least expected a room where we could all fit into without having to try to scramble over our luggage and each other's beds! I've travelled to over 50 countries and stayed in a lot of rooms, but this just was ridiculous. We politely handed back our room key to the lady at reception and said to her that the room was just too small for four people, and she agreed! We should have suspected this when we arrived and she asked if we had booked two rooms. We caught a taxi and soon found another place to stay with a much larger room, a pool, free internet (unlike the Inn which had a very high rate) and included breakfast for less than $248 Sing. When we arrived back home three days later we found that we had already been billed $292 Sing. by The Inn for the room which surprised us a lot. It wasn't as though we had just changed our minds because we didn't like the room- it was just not what we were told it was when we booked it- A FAMILY ROOM We emailed the hotel to ask for an expanation with no reply, so we waited a week and sent another email with no reply again. Yet when we were booking the hotel, we received promp replies. They have our money yet are too unprofessional to even reply. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Singapore, I would not go near The Inn at temple Street. It is just a small 'Boutique' hotel with little in the way of amenities or views. There is nothing special about it. If you want to visit Chinatown it is very easy and inexpensive to catch public transport or even walk there form another part of the city where there are heaps of hotels with similar (or cheaper) rates than The Inn.
