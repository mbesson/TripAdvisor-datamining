Sink in the room, and only one shower/toilet for all of us but it wasn't really a problem. The kitchen is decent, and the free breakfast consists of cereal, juice/tea/coffee, and bread with jam/peanut butter/nutella/cheese spread. Internet cuts out a lot but WiFi is free, and there are also 2 computers for guest use. The location is in the museum district, and a bit of a walk to get to the red light district and the majority of the touristic spots.

We stayed in a 6 bed room with ensuite bathroom, and the room itself was fine - clean and even had a balcony. The bathroom was alright, although tiny for both a toilet and shower. However, I think we may have just lucked out with the room - friends staying at the same time in a larger, boiling hot dorm downstairs were not so happy, as they had to cross through the kitchen to get to the shower/bathroom from their room. I have no complaints about the the location - the hotel is right next to the Museumplein, as well as a supermarket and a tram stop. My main issue is with the service. This place did not have many things that I consider to be standard issue for a hostel in a major city - no lockers, for one, plus they only accept cash payment. This was a big issue for me, as I had booked four friends who were all arriving at different times, and was made to pay for all of their bookings in cash, up front. They didn't have enough key cards, and could therefore only give us two keys for our party of four. Breakfast was free, but only served til 9am and less than inspiring. Front desk staff were often clueless or downright rude. The bottom line is, in a backpacker-filled city like Amsterdam, Annemarie doesn't have a clue about how to cater to budget travelers.

I have travelled throughout Asia and stayed in many third world countries and what those places lack in comfort and quality amenities they make up for in customer service. However this hostel has neither. Like many others, when choosing a place to stay we decided to pay a bit less and just put up with one star accomodation. It proved a costly mistake, finacially and to our holiday. Firstly upon arrival you are asked to pay a series of extra cost such as deposits and taxes. I have had exactly the same experiences as some of the other reviewers here as we never got our deposit back. The reason the management gave us was that we had drinks in our room. When we asked what was wrong with that they pointed to a small sign on the other side of the door that simply read, \"no drink in rooms.\" Even water isn't exceptable. The result of breaking this rule was $150 euro. The breakfast is a joke as some members of my group were told not to have any more toast before even having a first slice and the hostel provides five boiled eggs for everyone staying. The hostels website boasts a young a vibrant staff who are happy to cater to the needs of younger guests. This could not be further from the truth as all staff we encountered were bored, rude or completely useless; the manager being worst of all. When told we could not drink in our rooms we drank in the common area where we were constantly told to be quiet. Were we not such a determind group of travelleres this could have seriously effected our city break.
