We stayed in a lower cost double room - the room was clean, simple, just what we needed - we were very comfortable during our stay in room 204. The most important feature of all was the staff. I was taken ill on the second night and had to go to hospital. The receptionist went the extra mile to ensure that I was OK - helping us with translations over the phone and relaying to us what was going on. We were so grateful for this.

The staff are very friendly and you cannot beat the location. The rooftop terrace has SUBLIME views over the blue mosque and it's worth staying at this hotel for that reason alone. The rooms are very compact; we stayed in a standard double the first night and you will certainly be able to find rooms in other hotels with more space. Here, you are paying for the location and the character. Each room is painted with murals that give the rooms a really quirky, unusual feel - it's for those who want to stay somewhere a little different. We stayed at the back of the hotel and were completely untroubled by any traffic noise or the call to prayer. Given the location, there's a tremendous selection of bars and restaurants and with the Arasta bazaar opposite, the shopping is even better (it's more relaxed, less touristy and less claustrophobic than the grand bazaar). I would definitely recommend the garden cafe that's nearby (opposite the Blue House Hotel) where you can relax and enjoy good food, a bubble pipe and regular performances a whirling dervish while the locals play backgammon. The main sights are within easy walking distance; Hagia Sofia, the Blue Mosque, Topkapi, The Hippodrome and the Cistern can all be reached in 5-10 minutes. The Grand Bazaar is about 15 minutes away by foot. You really couldn't be better placed. For those with mobility problems, be aware that there is no lift and the stairs are tight. However, being at the top of the Sultanahmet hill, there's less of a trek to the sights. I thought about giving 4 stars for the review due to the size of the rooms.

The rooms though simple in their layout are cosy, clean and have a charm not to be found in the standard homogenous hotel rooms of the world. The roof top dining/lounge area in which a traditional turkish breakfast plate is served (in my experience when I got up rather than when the hotel thought I aught to be having breakfast, another nice touch) is fitted out in warm wooden panelling which brought to mind a ships interior and provides the guest with a warm and relaxing place to read and think. One of Hotel Ararat greatest assets is its location.
