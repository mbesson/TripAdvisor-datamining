The bed was firm and comfortable and wifi was free and it always worked. When you first arrive, it is a little tricky because reception is located on the 2nd floor and it isn't well marked. Even though it's next to the Spanish Steps, noise was never a problem for us. The proximity to the Metro makes this location even better. These things alone probably would have garnered 5 stars for me, but it was the service that made this hotel so fantastic. First, our flight was delayed multiple times and, when we finally arrived, the car we had arranged through the hotel was there to pick us up. Then, the airline lost my wife's luggage and not only did the hotel staff make many calls on our behalf while we were in Rome, they also continued to coordinate with staff from the villa's we stayed at in Tuscany during the rest of the trip. I cannot exaggerate how much that extra effort helped us to stay sane throughout our baggage ordeal.

The rooms were impeccably clean with very nice antique furniture, yet very modern bathroom facilties. The view from our window was of the Spanish Steps and a beautiful little courtyard on the neighboring building. Surprisingly enough we slept very well and the noise and buzz coming from the Spanish Steps was not a concern once our window was shut. The hotel also offers airport pickup and drop off which is very reasonably priced and the service was first class all the way. They picked up and dropped off right at the front door.

We have stayed in Rome before (Sofitel), and are disappointed we only found this hotel now. For the price, the location and comfort of the rooms is outstanding. And the prettiest corridor! All in all a better room than the Sofitel - at a far discounted price. The staff were also very obliging and welcoming. No, it's not a 5 star hotel - there is no room service and no staff on the front desk after 11.00 pm - but there is always someone on call, the hotel gives you a card and phone number to call should there be any problems. Our room was extremely quiet, even though it looked out onto the small side street that led to the Metro - always a steady stream of people coming and going. Breakfast was easy - my husband went to a local cafe and bought coffee and pastries 'to go' ... so we had a great breakfast in bed! Only two concerns. On arriving back at the hotel after 11.00 pm, our key wouldn't open the door. Luckily another guest returned at the same time, who let us in. I think we were doing something wrong, as when the staff checked the next morning the key worked. So maybe check you know how to use the key before you go out! Our other concern was that we asked the hotel to organise transport for us to and from the airport - it was at the same rate as taxis, so seemed the easiest way to go. But arriving and leaving both drivers were quite frightening. One was texting as he drove, and we missed an accident by centimetres. Both spoke on phones while driving and both insisted on driving at 130 kms (allowable on the freeways to the airport), but too fast for us. Both also tailgated at high speed. Yes, they did stop talking/texting when asked, and slowed down (a little) on our request - but begrudgingly. And we know how Italians drive, but this is a service provided for tourists, who I think would mostly feel the same way we did. Next time we'll take a taxi as we have done before, with no problems!

Not having a place for breakfast at the hotel was not a problem, as there are countless cafes in the area where you can eat... and even more a slightly further walk away. The hotel provided us with a list of restaurants and cafes which had been recommended by other guests, and each and every one of these places we tried were wonderful. With free WiFi, we were able to plan our days while in our room, and any questions we had were helpfully answered by everyone on the front desk. We were even allowed to use the computer to check in for our flight back and print off the boarding passes. Excellent service! The only slightly small downside was the bed. Although it was comfortable, it seemed to be higher in the middle, and sloped downwards towards the sides of the bed, resulting in waking a few times on the first night feeling I was falling out of bed.

The trip was made very special by the hotel that we were in. First things first this is not a hotel in the traditional sense of the word. There is no room service or restaurants in the hotel, it is the facility of a room in a great location. The hotel is indeed situated no more than 25meters from the Spanish steps in the Piazza di Spagna. When you arrive you need to go upto the 1st floor to check in. There is a small lift or stair case. We arrived around 2pm and the room was ready for us to check in. We were in room 106 which was a lovely superior double room. There was a massive double bed, side tables, wardrobe and dressing table with a traditional feel. The furniture was made of cherry with green damask coverings. The bathroom was very nice with a subtle modern feel with sink, loo, bidet and shower. The room was clean and nicely presented with the cleaners having done a thorough job. Every day we were there the room was made up well whilst we were sight seeing. The thing that struck us was that the room whilst not large felt large which may have been down to the high ceiling. There was also a fridge, safe, airconditioning and TV in the room. I am a light sleeper so I unpluged the fridge at night to prevent the compressor waking me. The key factor with the hotel like all things is the people who run it. The team was outstanding, a lovely small team of four people. Nothing was too much trouble for them and every enquiry was met with a smile and a can do approach regardles of the stupidty of the question. They make this hotel the gem it is and a very pleasent stay in Rome, it is a daunting thing visiting a foreign city for the first time and not speaking the language fully and the team at the hotel made it easy and very pleasent. The hotel is in an ideal position and there is very little that you can not visit on foot and avoid useing the white cabs (never accept that there is a fixed rate and they will try to rip you off). The Vatican was a 30minute walk away and the Trevi fountain 10minute walk away, so long as you do not get lost on the way!!!! Also the tube line is a 1minute walk from the hotel, and a 75minute ticket will cost you only 1euro !!!! The hotel supplies a little booklet in the room listing all sorts of different restaurants around different locations in the city. We found this very useful and it helped us make decisions about where we were going to eat. There are so many different places to eat that you are spoilt for choice. Our tip would be the Do Bar for breakfast (15 euros for 2 people) and the Osteria Margutta for a lovely supper in a lovely retaurant (100euros for 2 people). We did a Private Tour of the Vatican which we had been recommended to do and I would strongly recommend that if you are visiting the Vatican you do this. The queues are huge and the private tour skips all these and you get a very personal tour instead of being in a group of 25. DO NOT do any tour of the Coloseum it is not worth it, the audio guide supplies you with all the information you need. I would recommend a tour of the Roman Forum & Palatine Hill as there is so much to see and understand. The Italians have not made this area very user friendly and it is very confused even with an audio guide. Also the toilet facilities are not the most pleasent for a lady. If you are visiting the coloseum the tip is to buy your ticket at the Palatine hill entrance the queue was minimal with only 3 couples ahead of us. The ticket you buy can cover all three places and is 2minutes walk from the coloseum. Armed with said ticket you can return to the coloseum and walk past the queue which stretches around the monument straight to the front. We did not book our visits with the hotel but they can organise them for you. If the car we organised with the hotel to take us back to the airport was any example then you wont be disappointed. It is an amazing city and we will be visiting again as there is so much to see. We would highly recommend the Relais Pierret as a base to stay and visit the city. Great job and we will see you again soon.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cAlex was great !!!\u201d", "Author": "bageguy", "ReviewID": "UR42386515", "Content": "My wife and I stayed two nights at the Relais Pierret.

The room pictures posted by other guests are true to how the rooms actually appear. The windows do open for fresh air. The elevator was small but this is standard throughout Europe.

It was a pleasant surprise to find upon arriving that the hotel that they offered free internet service. The location of the hotel next to the Spanish Steps was great; within reasonable walking distance of many sites (including the Hard Rock Cafe and Harley-Davidson dealer), and a very short walk to the Metro to get to more remote sites like the Vatican (3 metro stops away) and the Colosseum (5 stops with 1 switch). No breakfast is provided, but that's not a big deal as there are many places to eat in the area. As an aside, one place I would strongly discourage anyone from frequenting is the Cardesi SRL gelateria near the Spanish Steps (see my review at http://rome-hotels.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187791-i22-k2327175-l17444440-Gelati_by_the_Spanish_Steps-Rome_Lazio.html for more information), as we were among the many that establishment has ripped off.

The location is, as you have read, on the piazza at the Spanish Steps. As you face the steps, at the bottom, immediately to the left is the famous Babbington's Tea Room. This building is to the left of that. It was built in 1800 (or so), but with a lift and beautiful common areas in the hotel. The rooms and facilities are very modern, clean and comfortable. The Spanish Steps are alive with people, so that you find yourselves in a very lively part of town. The hotel is just far enough to the side that you are not walking through crowds to get to it. Although there is street noise at night, if you notice it, it stops before it is too late because, like any public space in Rome with lots of people, there is a casual police presence. We never saw any trouble there. Around the corner from the hotel is an entrance to the Metro. With a little investigation, you could easily take the train from the airport to the Termini station, then switch to the Metro and arrive nearly at the hotel door. The Metro has a couple of exits some streets apart, so this was not clear to me (before we went) and we arranged for transportation from the airport, but on the way back we went by Metro because it is so close and convenient. We walked nearly everywhere that we wanted to go, so we only used the Metro to get on time to early tours at the Vatican Museums and the Palatine Hill. This hotel is very well located if you want to walk the city to sights. It felt good to walk off some of the great meals we had. Of course, the expensive retail shops are in the streets nearby, and it is always entertaining to window shop, when they are closed, on the way back to the hotel. I cannot say enough about the staff. There are hotel staff that are helpful, and then there are staff like the ones at this hotel that really take it to the next level (or two). One of the most helpful things they did was to recommend restaurants and to make reservations. Without exception, we were recommended to charming local inexpensive restaurants, and with our reservations came excellent treatment. I have an allergy that I could never adequately explain at restaurants, but that issue was always clear with the reservation. One reservation was at a restaurant that, we were told, was touristy but that they (the staff) ate there. We went in, tried to explain to a waiter that we had a reservation, but were seated with other tourists, which seemed natural enough. But I wanted to be certain that it was clear who we were so they knew I was the one with the allergy, and when an english speaking waiter (not our first one there) found out about our reservation, he told us that our table was upstairs. We were escorted to a table upstairs where the customers were all local Italians and where the service was remarkably better. I attribute this to the staff recommendation, naturally, and give it to you as an example of how they can make a difference in your Rome experience. Truly, there are countless fine hotels in Rome. I am simply saying here that you can rest assured that you have found one that will exceed your expectations.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cIf you are looking for quiet romance, do not stay here on a weekend!\u201d", "Author": "starrey", "ReviewID": "UR27391976", "Content": "We visited this hotel for one night.

The only thing that put a downer on the trip was our flight back being cancelled, due to the snow, but again the Guest Relations Manager was brilliant and immediately booked us into another room (into Internatiozional Dormus) which was on the 3rd floor, again the room was lovely (slightly smaller than the one downstairs) but nonetheless of the same immaculate condition and cleanliness. What I would say to anyone going to Rome for the first time is when you do go out to eat check the prices on the menus as one of the cafe's tried to charge us 60 euros for a plate of Spaghettie and an omelette.

You come out of your hotel door and you are on the street at the bottom of the Spanish Steps and 50 yards away from the Metro. Other major sites are close by within walking distance. One word of caution though and that's be prepared for excessive food and drink prices in restaraunts. Some charging as much as twelve euros for a bottle of local beer. Pizza is as good as anything and McDonalds is cheap enough as often as you can manage it. Travelling in January is great to avoid the crowds and as long as you dress warm you'll be fine. The hotel have big umbrellas that you can take out if it rains. A nice touch I thought. An open top bus tour is about 18 euro for one day and 24 for two and is a great way to get around - hop on and hop on. Pick the red buses.

After reading all the positive reviews on trip advisor i chose the Relais Pierret for location and the size of the room. Neither one disappointed us. From beginning to end the hotel offered excellent service from their very quick replies to my emails and their useful information on restaurants etc in Rome. The hotel was at first hard to find as we had an airline car transfer that dropped us off at the wrong hotel but if you are facing the spanish steps its the building to your left with the boutique Furla next to the large front doors that lead to the 8 quaint rooms on level 1 of the building. Our room was larger than expected - the bed was one of the most comfortable we have slept in - it consisted of 2 twin beds which I think are zipped together to form one large very comfortable bed with 4 pillows (2 firm and 2 soft). The bathroom had 2 separate basins and were separated by another door so you had his/her bathrooms - one had the bathtub and basin and the other room had the toilet, bidet and basin. Again another reason why i would stay at this hotel again. The ceilings were around 18 feet high which gave us a greater feeling of space. We were fortunate not to have any loud guests during our stay as you can hear the footsteps down the corridor and any chatting but this would not deter us from staying here. Rome during New Years Eve is amazing.... the atmosphere is incredible and the weather was cold and clear so we were able to spend the night ouside at the open air concert ouside of the Colosseum and then sit at the Fountain of Trevi at 2am eating pizza and drinking campari. An unforgettable night. It was comforting returning to our hotel each evening to our lovely room which felt like home after 7 days.

We shared a taxi with people we knew and ran into from California who happened to be in Rome to catch a cruise. I had booked the Relais months ahead of time to ensure I got a good room for three people. When I booked, the exchange rate was $1.37 > Euro, but when I arrived, it was $1.56. Regardless, we had a nice room. We had two comfortable twin beds and a good sofa sleeper. Plenty of room and a large modern bath. Our room had a large window that looked towards the Spanish Steps but all we could see was an outdoor patio and a wall that separated the steps from the building, but you could easily see the window from the steps. No complaints. I slept next to the open window and heard a little noise going on outside but it did not disturb my sleep. My sister is a very light sleeper and she had no problems either. The Hotel is on the first floor (2nd floor in the States) and there is an elevator to take you up. Our room was directly across from the check in desk but it was never noisy. The desk closes at about 10:00 pm and is re-staffed at about 9:00 am. They provide you with phone numbers - just in case. There is no breakfast but they will give you a card to go to a much overpriced tea room for breakfast (25E) and recommend other locations in the area. There is a mini refrigerator and they stocked it with three bottles of fruit juice and a basket of teas, coffee and toast- but they do not replenish it. We had to ask for coffee and tea on the third day. There is also interest access so we were able to check weather reports, train schedules, etc. The rain stopped at the end of the second day. We had a wonderful time in Rome and enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was a great location and everyone was happy with the room. I would recommend the hotel to anyone. Staff was very nice and helpful. I have been to Rome a few times and you really need to pay attention to room descriptions and locations. You can get a room that is less expensive, but if you are use to US type hotels, you may be disappointed. This hotel is much like staying at a brand hotel in the States but on a small scale. The furniture was in good shape (not 1960's era), the wallpaper did not have any stains (common occurrence in Rome) and the ceiling in the main hall was beautifully painted. I mention this because I have stayed at many locations in Italy paying large hotel prices for a Motel 6 type room. Just keep in mind everything is expensive in a large city and this is no different that New York. I would stay here again and recommend the location to friends. My only complaint is that I feel they should have re-stocked drinks (bottles and pkgs).", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "southeast", "Title": "\u201cgreat location and place to stay\u201d", "Author": "mlrds", "ReviewID": "UR15614234", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights for our wedding anniversary.

This is the one. I spent hours researching and looking for the perfect hotel to stay with my wife for a surprise trip. Luckily, I found Relais Pierret. It is everything you want in a Roman hotel. First, the location is perfect--just next to the Spanish Steps. You walk out right into the Piazza. It is right around the corner from the subway and surrounded by restuarants, cafes, and shops. Second, the hotel itself just feels like Rome. When you travel to Rome, you don't want to stay in some corporate hotel room. You want to feel like you live there. Here, you enter through 15 foot wooden doors and climb one flight of marble stairs. The hallway is beautifully painted and maintained. The rooms are beautiful. The ceilings are 20 feet high. The windows are 10 feet. The furnishings are perfect. While still maintaining its charm, each room has every amenity you would want without feeling like you are staying in a large chain hotel. You have a LCD television, heat and air con. operated by a remote control and a small frig, but you do not lose that feeling that you are staying small Roman villa. The bathroom was large. The water pressure was great. The bed was extremely comfortable. Every day our room was spotless. We stayed in a king-size bedroom, but the staff let us see the 4 person room. It would be great for a family with the balcony overlooking the piazza. The king-sized room was a very good size for a European hotel room. Finally, and most importantly, I cannot even express how fantastic the hotel staff was--especially Alex. Alex arranged for a car to pick us up and take us to the airport at 3 AM. He arranged for a private tour of the Vatican with a great guide, recommended restaurants. He helped my wife with a doctor visit when she became ill. He just made us feel welcome and at home. The staff truly cares about their job and making sure your stay is enjoyable. You can waste countless hours researching hotels and reading reviews (believe me I have done it), but you are just wasting your time. You should just book Relais Pierret, and move on to playing the rest of your trip.

Walk everywhere. We did everything apart from the Vatican on foot. The Colosseum is a mere 20 minutes away and on route there are a feast of fountains and amazing architecture. Even our 10 year old loved wondering around and taking it all in. There is a supermarket just 2 minutes from the hotel where you can stock up on nibbles and very cheap and very good wine for a picnic in the park. We were greeted by the charming Alessandro who gave us a fact sheet with everything you need to know for your stay. He even gave us his mobile number should we hit any problems. He gave us plenty of advice and told us the we could go on line for free and make local calls for nothing too. The fridge was stocked with juice and water and we could make hot drinks and nibble on biscuits, melba toast and jams which were all provided. Our suite was perfect. Beautiful and luxurious decor. High ceilings, windows you could fling open, air conditioning and a flat screen tv should you feel the need to keep in contact with the outside world. I truly could not believe that we had hit on something so good. I cannot recommend this highly enough and we are already planning to return. Rome is a very special place and so much cheaper than I expected. Grecos is pricey but well worth a visit for coffee and cake. TheVerde got the big thumbs up for lunch and dinner.
