In this case, it's true: Just across the strada there is one of the best pasticerrie in Venice, where they make the cornetti (croissants) fresh and the espresso is delicious.

Also although a double bed was requested, there was just two singles joined together, creating that familiar gap in the middle. However, i cant say that my stay was a disaster.

The breakfast was good as well, but was surprised of the lack of cheese selection and no hard boiled eggs (that I could find). The location was smack dab in the middle of the busy area of town.

Reception was straightforward, with documents and payment, informative but not particularly friendly as noted by most reviewers. We were given the key to room 101, at 1:35pm, and found it unmade, beds stripped and bathroom dirty. Returned to reception, wondering why they would give us a dirty room and was told it would be cleaned by 2pm when the official \u00e2\u20ac\u0153check in time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was, and not before! Requested another room, but was told there were no rooms with two single beds available; offered a room with one double bed. Looked at it and decided to wait. Returned to the hotel at 2:05 and the room was ready. For women traveling alone I would not recommend rooms on the ground floor 101-103 as the windows open up into a small inside courtyard with easy access to the windows and the glass elevator is located just outside the room window. While within the hotel complex, it still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel safe and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave the window open to cool down the hot room. The room was nicely decorated and appeared clean, until we pulled the beds apart and found dust balls everywhere. Poor soundproofing was a problem; in the next room there was a family with a baby that cried intermittently throughout the night and made sleeping difficult. TV had CNN in English and other assorted channels in different languages. The bathroom was clean, with only very minor mold noted in the shower area. The hairdryer was taped together at the base; prompting us not to use it. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise, as in Venice I am use to the basket of rolls and coffee only. The breakfast buffet had an assortment of rolls, pound cakes, meat, cheese, hardboiled eggs, tomatoes, breads with salad/meat toppings and peas! Yogurt, cereal and two types of juice were also offered, with coffee. Check out was at 11 and we were not departing Venice until 2 so we asked to leave our bags. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baggage storage area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is an unsecured, dark area under the stairs in the back of the hotel, where anyone could access your luggage without being noticed. I would suggest bringing a small lock it you plan to leave luggage here. We returned to pick up our luggage and use the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public bathrooms near the elevator on the ground floor and was amazed that management appears to have removed the sink\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water handle (it was there in the morning) on the fish bowl sink, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wash your hands/use the sink during the day! If they are trying to save money, this gesture just leaves a bad feeling when departing the hotel! Overall, my stay was OK but not a 3 star hotel and not worth 90EU/140 USD.

He definitely made you feel like you were an inconvenience! We hoped that the other staff would be better the next day , unfortunately she was not much better (female Hitler), in fact they were so unapproacable that whatever information we needed about Venice we got from a nice jewellery shop vendor a few shops down the street from the hotel. Initially we tried to see if we could change their attitude by our greetings and smiles but too bad it did not work, so we totally ignored them when coming in or leaving the hotel.

I particularly like the location as it's just a few hundred meters from the railway station down the main street leading to the centre of Venice. I tried other hotels at different locations in Venice, but I find it too annoying to carry the luggage around the city (lots os steps, always crowdy, VERY difficult to move around with luggage) and on the vaporetto, where you have to pay extra for luggage and it's always so crowdy it's a mission just to enter or leave it. As the train station area is the main arrival point for any kind of transport it's ideal for staying if you don't want the extra fuss. I don't think Venice has the best or worst hotel location as every part of the city is interesting. This hotel is in good condition with a nice lobby. The furnishing is typical venetian, with lots of mirrors, velvet, brocade and rich colours. The rooms vary, but I prefer the ones who look at the street (it can be noisy as it's the main street which is always filled with tourists) and I find it charming to look down and observe the lively atmosphere. They are clean enough and have a venetian feel to them. The breakfast is delicious and has lots of varity, which isn't always the point in Venice hotels. You want to eat good and enough in the morning as grabbing a pastry and a sandwich at a caffe can be quite expensive. The room prices can vary depending on the season and the weekend/non weekend, but you can get a GREAT deal on the net.

I travel a lot and have stayed at many different types of hotels, some good, some bad, and some in-between. But this hotel was off the range. As I went into my tiny room (with a fold up toilet!), I thought it smelt weird, but I thought, \"it's an old hotel, and I should expect it to smell musty\".... but the smell got worse and my nose started itching.. then I noticed that the carpet was soaking wet. No idea where the leak came from, but it must have been there for a while for that smell to be so pungent. Anyway, I went down to the reception and asked to change the room. They didn't of course have any other rooms, and their basic reaction was that I could take it or leave it. As it was 10.00 pm by that time, I decided to stay, but agreed with the receptionist that I would get a discount of EUR 100 (room cost of EUR 150). The receptionist was quite helpful in that she put some towels down on the floor to soak up some of the liquid (I dread to think what it was!). I had the worst night ever (and I normally sleep like a puppy). Next morning, as I was checking out, they charged me EUR 100 and maintained that the receptionist from the night before had agreed this - I couldn't prove or disprove anything, so I paid - strangely enough, they charged the room on my colleague's credit card - maybe they were worried I would stop the payment. The staff were particularly unfriendly and actually seemed really fed up - they said I could phone the Manager if I wanted, but he wouldn't do anything. The hotel sells itself on its location (and the entrance/ reception area is grand) and they can really get away with anything.

I finally got my passport out and showed him my last name, He then got very angry with me and proceeded to lecture me about the correct pronunciation of my last name!! He went on to tell me (in english) that he is not an English speaker so therefore I need to learn how to correctly pronunciate my name well enough for him to understand!! I was quite certain that SPELLING it three times would have worked!! He finally finished processing our checkin and we were on our way. The room was clean, comfortable, as was the bathroom. The best part was that our room #402 faced the back of the hotel, so it was REALLLLY quiet, which was nice. The hotel also had a lift/elevator for baggage. Breakfast was predictable but tasty with an assortment of pastries, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, fruit, thin ham slices, bread for toasting, and three varieties of juice. Overall, i would stay there again as the price was right and the location was great, I would just be sure to learn how to say my own name correctly.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "vacay1117", "ReviewID": "UR8228260", "Content": "I loved this place.

Kiosk staff at the airport were excellent, explaining various ticket options for the bus to Venice. The Belle Epoque is close to the bus station - out of the bus station to the Grand Canal, turn right, cross the bridge, right again, and the hotel is just on the left - so you don't have to carry your luggage a long distance. Welcoming staff, a comfortable room in a well-situated hotel. What more could I ask for? The breakfast (served in the breakfast room) was good, but could become boring if on a longer stay. My room was on the second floor, accessed by stairs rather than a lift, but was comfortable and adequate for one person. The bathroom was small, but well-equipped. It could have been cleaned to a higher standard, though. The hotel is close to the waterbus stop connecting you to all parts of Venice, and is situated on the main thoroughfare leading through the city. An excellent location. Altogether a good experience for my first visit to Venice,and I would certainly stay here again.", "Date": "May 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location\u201d", "Author": "WestOzgirl", "ReviewID": "UR6325586", "Content": "I stayed here for 2 nights and found the location to be fantastic. Only a few minutes walk from the train station, and on a main street filled with shops, restaurants, etc. Great budget restaurant very close by was BREK . On the downside, the 2 of the 3 reception staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. To reach my room, I had to take the lift, and then walk up a very narrow steep staircase of 10 steps, to some sort of tiny landing - very difficult with a heavy suitcase, which I had to push up the stairs one step at a time. As there was a timber railing above the stairs, it wasn't possible to stand upright and pull the case up the stairs. No help was forthcoming form any of the staff, and I really struggled with this. SOmeone old or a bit infirm would not manage this set of stairs every time they had to come or go. The room had long timber beams all the way across the ceiling, which were so low that I bumped my head on them several times. A tall person sitting up in bed would have bumped their head on the beams, which extended across the bed . Bathroom ceiling was also very low. Room would have been very claustrophobic for a tall person. Breakfast room was very pleasant compared to some of the hotels I stayed in in Italy. For 60 euros a night, I thought this was very good value, but when booking, specify you want a room which is not one of the 2 located on the stairs at the top of the landing on the 2nd floor!", "Date": "December 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Feistylion", "ReviewID": "UR6024923", "Content": "Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel for 100euro a night.
