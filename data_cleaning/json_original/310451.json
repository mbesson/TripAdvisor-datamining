Maybe a minus 1 star would be more appropriate. Rude help, unreasonable prices, dirty room, and generally this place offers a poor experience. I'm surprised that they didn't charge my wife and I for air and through it all, they behave like they have the corner on the nice hotel market. If you don't like paying too much, being treated poorly, and being made to feel like you came from another planet because you don't speak Spanish, you won't like this place. Particulars you ask...Air Conditioner made the room sound like an airplane taking off, nice linens are a foreign concept to this place, food is expensive and awful, but above all the staff is very rude when you bring up any problems to them. I am not a complainer, but I am angry with this place. I have been in 72 countries, I speak two languages other than English, and I have been around the world at least 10 times.

The staff was wonderful, the hotel immaculate, the pool was spectacular. Two negatives were the pillows had a funky oder and the food in the restaraunt left much to be desired for the price. They have minimal handicap accessibility, although they said they are currently out for bids for elevators. The beach is a very short walk and it's gorgeous...heavy rip tides though. I can't begin to describe the hospitallity of the front desk staff!! They were amazing!!! I even made $112 in the casino at a penny slot machine (paid for dinner) :-) I had my twin 17 year old nieces with me and didn't give a second thought to them walking anywhere on the grounds at any time of day or night.

The front desk was always very happy to assist and we were greeted warmly by all staff we would pass by. The room was very nice but needs to be upgraded (old TV, no dresser for makeup....). The amenities are nice, Trueblue spa! We had a leak problem in the room and they quickly came to resolve the issue. The grounds are beautiful and very relaxing. The pool is nice, but we did not go in, was cold and seemed to not be heated. The beach by the hotel is not for swimming at all, and the surf was rough while we were there so we travelled elsewhere for beach fun. The negative things I found were that you have to pay for parking (you need a car to get to Humacao and travel around....nothing in the area in terms of activities), no elevator so you have to either bring up the luggage yourself or use bellhop service, no ice machine in the building we were staying at, and the food is way overpriced for the value. My boyfriend and I had a couple of drinks, a sandwich, and an order of wings for lunch at the pool bar and it came out to $68 dollars, which is ridiculous and the food was only average...My suggestion, eat elsewhere. Overall the customer service and scenery are the +++ for this hotel.

We had what i would call a \"WOW\" experience, this is the very 1st WOW I have given to hotels I have stayed in throughout the world, I travel to SE Asia, Europe, Mexico and other places. This is the reason why it is wow- Before coming to Wyndham Garden at Palmas del Mar, we were staying at the Marriott Condado Beach, San Juan for 4 nights, we were surprised to find a bottle of wine, fruit and snacks waiting for us, I thought maybe it came from the Marriott management for being Elite members, but when I read the card, it was from Limarie Moral, ByRequest Coordinator of Wyndham Garden, the note read that they were very excited and looking forward to our stay at their hotel, no hotel has ever done this before, to take the time to find out what room we were in and doing a little research of who we are and so forth. In addition, Flavia Bonilla, Guest Service Manager at Wyndham Garden at Palmas del Mar Hotel & Casino, saw us in the lobby and introduced herself, she knew who we were and something I have not experienced in many hotels ever.

This hotel had NO ELEVATOR!!! I am disabled and was forced to climb not one, not two, not three, but four flights of stairs to get to our first level room. I have handicapped parking permit, but there is no handicapped parking due to the locals parking there to visit the casino, they have no hotel handicapped parking available. And if that wasn't bad enough, we looked at the cars that were parked in the handicapped spaces in front of the hotel and one of them did NOT have a handicapped placard. We parked in the horseshoe in front of the hotel to take our luggage into our room which was a distance, by the time we got back to our car (our placard was visible but we were parked along the sidewalk) the security guard had slapped a \"NO PARKING\" sticker on our window, I was shocked and told him that he saw us unpacking the car and making several trips to get our luggage and why is he allowing a non-handicapped person to take one of the handicapped spaces, he walked over to investigate and told us, \"Oh, that is the general managers car, his private parking space is taken by the other manager\", so here we are, disabled, and the general manager who is NOT handicapped takes up a handicapped spot and then makes sure to slap a big sticker on our window that we were not parked legally! Everyone else parked along the sidewalk to unload their luggage, but due to our disabilities and the distance of our room it took us ten minutes longer to make it back to the car to get the rest of the luggage! The only good thing was the infinity pool, but I did get a rash from using the hot tub, the hot tub did not smell like chlorine the way I am used to, lets hope its not the flesh eating virus!!! The staff at the front desk was happy and very eager to help, very professional...too bad I can't say the same for the egotistical security guard!!! They had a restaurant that was understaffed and people were becoming irate that it was taking over an hour to cook their child a hotdog. There was a David's Cookies there for breakfast and snacks.
