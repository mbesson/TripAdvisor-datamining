When sending email inquiry, there's no reply at all. I have been to Tokyo for few times, but first time chose to stay this hotel.The day I arrived was ranining, due to language barrier, they were not able to check my previous booking. Staff in reception was nice but English standard was poor. Finally, they still offered me a nice room with online discounted rate.Room was nice, at least spacious when comparing w/ other hotel rooms in Tokyo. Price was reasonable, stylish room (but tiny washroom) and breakfast was excellent.Location is accessable, just walk along the tunnel in train station. There's convenience store near the station exit and open til 10 sth, you can grab some food or snack b4 back to the hotel.", "Date": "Feb 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR610499208", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "HKSmartie"}, {"Content": "Good!

Not the most ideal location for us as tourists, but the price was right and the subway was easy. The staff was extremely helpful and bent over backwards to help us. They recommended a fabulous noodle place a block away. The beds are very comfortable. Not the most ideal hotel for families given they do not offer connecting rooms. The best part of the stay was the complimentary breakfast. Guests choose western (omelet) or Japanese. The western was just OK according to our kids, but the Japanese was fabulous. It was a lot of food, small servings of about a dozen items. It will give any foodie a little thrill to start the day.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR585128643", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Hinkochi"}, {"Content": "Strix was great.

An OK hotel. Friendly staff, clean rooms, transportation-friendly location being only footsteps from Ikebukuro station. Not exactly the best location in tokyo for a tourist though, as Ikebukuro is a major hub for residential traffic and not much else is out there for tourists to see -- yes, there's large department stores next door but that's like a tourist wanting to go see Sears in the US. Otherwise, Ikebukuro is just a madhouse of pedestrian traffic wanting to get through the area as quickly as possible, at all hours of the day! You'll be trampled if you stand in the way! The JR lines can be horribly crowded in this area. While it was cute to see the packed trains being pushed in by conductors like you see on TV, it got old really fast when we realized we needed to be on one of those to get around Tokyo. Will stay elsewhere next time as we lost a ton of time for commuting and like I mentioned, it was no fun after the first day.", "Date": "Jan 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR933576610", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "very friendly Stayed here in November 2003 for 3 nights, busy area but very safe.
