The staff was extremely nice, all of them always talked to you whenever they saw you, even if it was in another part of town. The food was excellent!! We recommend the coconut shrimp!!! If you are planning on a stay in Playa Del Carmen, please think about this Hotel, well worth cost. The only thing, it is not all inclusive. You get your room, breakfast every morning, and a beach chair every day, but otherwise you have to fend for yourself, but that is not all bad. There are many excellent restuarants in Playa Del Carmen and many are reasonable as long as your set on eating on 5th Avenue. Get off the beaten path and you will far well. Have a great time~!!!

Our hearts nearly broke when we were told at first that we wouldn't be able to stay here, but Steve worked with us even though we could only stay 4 nights which is under the minimum for this time of year. He made an exception since we were repeat customers. That is the kind of service you can expect from everyone at Playa Maya. When we got there, our room wasn't quite ready, so we went to the beach for lunch. We sat down, our waiter came over, and said, \"I remember you. You stayed here two years ago!\" Unbelievable!! This time we stayed in the jacuzzi garden. I loved the garden area, and the whirlpool tub was very relaxing after an exhausting day on the beach! The room was beautiful, quiet, and clean beyond belief. My husband loved the room too, but he admits he missed the superior balcony we had last time because he loves to sit on the balcony and watch the waves at night. Every part of our stay was fabulous...the room, the food, the drinks, and most of all the people. They really do go out of their way to make your stay the best it can be. It was very reassuring to return to our room after strolling 5th Avenue in the evening to have a security guard checking your room key to be sure you belonged there. I can't really say anything else that hasn't already been said about this place. I do know that we won't stay anywhere else when we come to PDC.

This was our 8th stay there, 4 for 2 weeks and 4 for 3 weeks, so with 20 weeks spent there now, I can advise you that much hasn't changed in 8 years, and the things that have were small and evolutionary, addressing the most-often voiced complaints. What is there to like about Playa Maya? First, and foremost, the staff! Many of them are long-time employees and you can't beat the feeling of landing on the beach at the foot of 8th street to be greeted by a round of handshakes and hugs as they grab the bags. Watching them day after day, they truly seem to be one big happy family. They eat lunch together in the afternoons and the restautrant is often filled with laughter. Long-time employees are the essence of consistent delivery. Along with that, the rooms are generous, the housekeeping is top notch, the food is amongst the best in Playa del Carmen, there is always a beach chair waiting for you, the service never stops and you are right around the corner from all that Playa del Carmen has to offer. And, just enough around the corner to enjoy a peaceful night's sleep while the disco's boom a few blocks away. There are a few things some won't like: only beach access, so kick off your shoes on 8th Street built-in StairMaster (it's 58 steps from the beach to the third floor, but I happen to like that) dipping pool, so no Olympic practice available With another 3-week stay concluded and next year's already booked, what more is there to say.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWe'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "Cottonhead", "ReviewID": "UR126071201", "Content": "We just returned from our 1st trip to Playa del Carmen and can't say enough about our stay at Playa Maya. The location is great and the hotel is safe, very clean and well maintained. Bathrooms are modern with good water pressure and the AC works well. We had a flat screen TV in the two rooms we stayed in. We had to change rooms mid-week due to availability and for us, the jacuzzi room with no view turned out to be our favorite. (The other room we stayed in was Studio A near the pool which has a queen bed and trundle as well as a table for 4 and kitchen area which is probably perfect for a family or someone who doesnt want stairs ) the jacuzzzi room was oversized, the king-size bed was comfortable and the bathroom and shower were pretty large.After a day in the sun, we enjoyed having our own private garden room open to the sky but shaded by trees. It gave us privacy and a place to sit outside our room which was perfect if one of us was sleeping etc. We were also able to sit outside when it rained. There is always a place available to lounge on the beach and the staff is nearby to assist if you need anything whether it's an umbrella, a drink or lunch.They don't push - they just keep an eye on things and appear when you need help. Breakfast on the beach is included and delicious. Lunch couldn't be beat either so why go elsewhere -- we never left the beach during the day. The staff is excellent and helped with anything we needed. When we first arrived, they simply appeared to carry our luggage across the beach to the hotel since Calle 8 deadends at the beach. Although this not a fancy luxury resort hotel, you will have everything you need and more. The refigerator was stocked with some drinks for our enjoyment and a large bottle of water was delivered daily. It is a testament to Playa Maya that most guests were repeat customers and the staff mentioned their goal was to make sure we relaxed and enjoyed our stay so we would come back -- they've got it right IMO. The hotel is one block from all the action on 5th Ave and we enjoyed walking and people watching each night after trying different restaurants. For transportation, we relied on Cancun Shuttle as recommended by the hotel and had no problems - we did call to confirm a meeting spot when they picked us up at the end of our stay since there is no car access to the hotel and we didn't want any problems getting to the airport. It worked out perfectly. We will definitely return to Playa Maya and recommend it highly.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mazeppa, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cTop 10 Reasons Playa Maya is Still our Favorite\u201d", "Author": "NorthPaw42", "ReviewID": "UR125368407", "Content": "10) One block from 5th Avenue...close to the action yet quiet at night.

A lucky reservation cancellation landed us a room (two different rooms, actually - we changed rooms midweek by choice) at the Playa Maya during the week of February 17. Who knew that we had secured a reservation at what is undoubtedly one of the finest (and very likely the finest small) hotel in Playa del Carmen?!! My husband and I have agreed that the week we spent in Playa del Carmen was the best vacation that we have had in the 15 years we have been together - and our stay at the Playa Maya absolutely played a major part in our experience. A staff that caters to their guests generally defines the quality of a hotel stay, and there are simply not enough superlatives to describe all of the staff that served our every want and need while we stayed. They are generous with their time and attention, and cheerful and gregarious with their interactions with their guests. If you stay, you will immediately recognize the following: \"FrontDesk\" Pedro, Julianna, Maria, \"Bar Pedro,\" Rasael, Carla, Carlos, the \"Juans\"... The cleaning staff is marvelously efficient; the beach crew is every bit attentive as everyone else. This is a small hotel, and it felt like home. We stayed in the Jacuzzi Garden room and in a Deluxe Balcony with Hammock room - and the accommodations were completely satisfying. We feel quite sure that we could have stayed in any of the rooms at the hotel and have been equally pleased. We met many wonderful people on the beach, hopefully linking to long-term relationships. As others have noted, the breakfast that is part of the lodging fee is more than sufficient. Both breakfast and lunch menus are extensive - and the food is great! And the drinks that they serve up are no \"resort\" watered-down beverages, either. We also tip our hat to Stephen Ryeberg who has put together such a wonderful staff - and who was also so attentive to all of the emails I sent, answering all of my questions and making suggestions in an amazingly quick response-time.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel by the beach.\u201d", "Author": "Joy S", "ReviewID": "UR125290665", "Content": "The staff are really friendly and helpful.

We stayed for 11 nights in February 2012. Playa Maya is in a fantastic location, and it had a nice home-away-from-home feel to it. Noise was never a problem. I was worried about this, given the central location. I am a light sleeper, and I could hear some bass from Fusion during the night, but it was not enough to keep me awake. We were right close to all the action on 5th Ave and never had to walk far to find a great restaurant, or even just to pick up a mid-day gelato. There was a security guard who would ask for our room number each evening when we returned to the hotel from dinner. Cleanliness was excellent. The staff were all very pleasant. At the beach, Juan, Jesus and Lucio were attentive and pleasant at all times. Juan would even notice when I was trying to adjust my lounger, and would come and lend a hand! At the same time, they were never intrusive. We visited Mamita\u2019s beach club and Wicky\u2019s, but we liked the staff best at Playa Maya, and found the loungers more comfortable too. Food was very reasonably priced, in my opinion. Beer was $20 pesos (cheaper than water). Cocktails varied, but were very large and ones I tried were in the $60 to $70 pesos range. Some of the items we enjoyed included mango margaritas, pina coladas, coconut shrimp, chicken tacos, nachos, guac and chips with fresh pico de gallo, chicken strips and fries (for our daughter). Hamburgers were average. There is a small pool, which was never busy. I personally prefer the beach, but our daughter also liked the pool. It is 4 feet deep at the deepest end, so enough for her to swim in a bit. There was also a sitting area above the pool. There was usually someone at the front desk, and they were all willing to help with any questions we had; Pablo even walked with us to the store where we bought a phone card that didn\u2019t work, to help us get a refund. Each morning there was a pot of coffee at the front desk and a bowl of packaged granola bars and/or cookies for guests to take. There are umbrellas for guest use too \u2013 something we found out after buying one for $15 US! Throughout the booking process, and my many questions! Stephen was very quick at responding. We stayed in room 304, a \u201cSuperior Ocean View\u201d for most of our visit, and then in room 105, a \u201cJacuzzi Garden\u201d room. I will give a bit of a comparison of the rooms: Superior Ocean View had a small balcony with two chairs and a nice ocean view. We made use of the small coffee pot and mini fridge, which was always stocked with water. There was plenty of space in the room. The bathroom was nice \u2013 a bit small, but with a large shower \u2013 never a problem with water temperature, though the pressure was poor (we often find this in Mexico). Air conditioning was excellent. I would definitely stay in this room type again. The view was just like the photos on the website. Jacuzzi Garden was large and lovely. The outdoor area is very nice, completely private with a fabulous large Jacuzzi tub surrounded by white curtains and a little bistro table and chairs. This would be a wonderful honeymoon suite. Due to the privacy of the room, however, you cannot see outside at all. For our purposes, we preferred the Ocean View room overall, because we liked having the ocean view. What we liked the most, overall: 1) The beautiful beach!! And we never had a problem getting loungers, even if we slept in. 2) The delicious breakfast! My favourite choice was waffles with bacon, fresh tropical fruit, juice and coffee. We loved having our toes in the sand and watching the waves while having a leisurely breakfast. 3) The staff, including Stephen during the booking process. The only negative I can think of is that beach towels were not available until about 9:30 or 10 a.m., so if you are an early riser this may be a nuisance.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay and excellent customer service\u201d", "Author": "Hedotwo", "ReviewID": "UR124156761", "Content": "My wife and I, along with our daughter and her husband just returned yesterday from a week long stay at Playa Maya.

The staff of Playa were outstanding and the rooms (we had room 301) were kept spotless.

Our included morning breakfasts were outstanding and my wife and I ate lunch 5 of the 7 days at Playa and found the meals to be a good value and very filling. As is often mentioned here, the fish tacos and coconut shrimp were excellent, but I think my favorite was their caribbean fish plate. The weather during our week was nice for the most part, with spotty rain in the evenings and a persistent wind on the beach which admittedly wore us down by weeks' end.

Felt like coming home! Clean, modern, safe, secure, very friendly, right in the heart of Playa, and very quiet - which was a concern of mine as i knew there are the all-night boom-boom clubs in the area. Minimal noise - i slept with the sliding door open, could hear the waves all night, and smell the coffee in the morning! Everything from making the reservation to checking out was effortless. Great full breakfasts are included - restaurant right on the beach. I met many long-term Playa vacationers that come spend the day here at the beach renting chairs (as opposed to other hotels or a beach club) - they said it was very friendly, knew the staff, and they come for the food as the restaurant is excellent. Hotel is located off 8th St North, nestled in with many other hotels big and small. Just 4 blocks from the ADO bus from the airport - no need for cab. Bustling 5th Ave is just up the street, with many excellent restaurants very close by. The entire area is very walkable. I ventured out deeper into town for more local diners (better prices). On different nights of the week different clubs have a band and thats 'the place to be' for happy hour/dancing/meeting others. I went as a single (50 y.o.) and had no problem meeting people and feeling very safe. Many of these clubs were right down the beach, so close to 'home' when the night was over. There are a lot of small hotels in town. The advantage of Playa Maya is that you're right on the beach - no need to put on shoes for most of the day, availability for great restaurant/snacks/refreshments with consistently friendly service, and are assured a beach chair and great service! Playa in general has really developed and is getting more pricey and sophisticated, with North Americans owning homes/condos, and many europeans opening up small inns and cafes - you can find most any activity/sport/yoga/health food, etc etc. For food, I tried to keep it local but found a great variety of choices - if you head off the tourist area, you can find great meals and get back into the ole'Mexico budget. Restaurants - these were recommended by others and I found consistently excellent food: Mexican - Carboncitos, just off 5th ave on 4th St - tortilla soup is a meal in itself Fogans - more local, on calle 20 just before 30th ave - great food = lots of tourists+locals Italian - Titi Panini - calle 10, b/w 10th and 15th ave; excellent healthy salad bar, wonderful owners. Thai - Babe's Noodles - calle 10 b/w 5th and 10th ave; half orders available also el Diez (\"10\") - Argentinian (after their Soccer player #10) - steaks, seafood, grilled veg's, great pizza - right on 5th ave and calle 26.

There was always staff around ready to help us with a smile. There are several breakfast choices that are also included. We tried almost every dish & were never disappointed. For lunch I really enjoyed the chicken tacos & my fianc\u00e9 still talks about the fish tacos. The rooms are cute & beachy, very clean & lots of room. We had a small fridge that was restocked with water every day which we thought was a nice touch. It was easy to get around town, short walk to 5th & a few blocks away from a Walmart & Mega, ferry to Cozumel is a just down beach & plenty of taxi's & collectivo's to take you to nearby places like Akumal & Tulum. We had a superior room with a view of the ocean & it was such a treat to see the sunrise in the morning. We truly enjoyed our stay here & are already planning our return trip in July.

First off, this is not a big hotel. around 20 rooms total. No glitz here. No fancy, big nightclub. Just a hotel tucked away on one of the most beautiful beaches anywhere. You access the hotel from the beach. There is no direct roadside access. On arrival, you take your bags down to the end of 8th St (stops at the beach), and the hotel bell-hops take your bags around the beach into the hotel. Don\u2019t bother renting a car. We didn\u2019t need a car the whole week we were there. The 5th Ave. market is just a block away from the hotel. And there\u2019s a Wal-Mart about 5 blocks up 8th St. from the hotel. The hotel itself was great. The front desk staff (Pablo, Maria & Yuliana) were most hospitable. They catered to our every need. They were always pleasant & professional to deal with. We had a few mechanical problems surface during our staff, but the hotel staff always accommodated us and usually provided a step-up solution. We relied on the hotel staff for recommendations on tours, instead of trying to deal with the time-share peddlers on 5th Ave. The staff set everything up for us with no hassle. The rooms were very comfortable and well cleaned. Some rooms had balconies. The balconies are not too big, but do offer a view of the beach. Wireless internet was provided at no additional charge. There is only 3 floors, and no elevator, so be prepared to take stairs up to the upper rooms. The hotel also has a nice restaurant where food & beverage can be purchased. You get a nice, free breakfast \u2013 and it is more than your standard continental breakfast. You can get eggs or pancakes if you wish. For the money, this place was a super deal. The beach accommodations are excellent. By staying in a room, you get access to a beach lounge chair (cushioned) with a large sun umbrella and one large beach towel. Drinks can be ordered through one of the restaurant staff members who keep a tab on the guests on the lounge chairs. Drinks were well made and a reasonable price. A great way to relax for the day. Early November seems to be one of the best times. It gets busy from January thru June with the European crowd, and of coarse it's busy at the Christmas holiday. Overall, this hotel is a gem. The front desk, restaurant and cleaning staff were all memorable. Mr. Ryberg (reservations) provided us with some great information in setting up our trip.

I bump all that is said about the staff \u2013 they keep the place nearly spotless in the difficult to maintain beachfront environment. A special note about housekeeper Angelina \u2013 along with great service, she\u2019s the best towel artist ever. I didn\u2019t have the heart to unravel any of her creations and she didn\u2019t either \u2013 just kept adding more! By the end of my stay my room resembled Noah\u2019s Ark and I must have had half of the hotel\u2019s towels. Looking and booking at the hotel\u2019s site is a bit awkward but work through it. Read the first part of the description carefully. To help figure some of the described room locations, first, on this site find a good photograph of the hotel taken from the beach (which incidentally runs north/south so the sunrise comes into your window and sunset is behind the hotel). The outer rooms on either side (orange/brown balconies, 2nd & top floors) are the \u201cDeluxe Balcony\u201d \u2013 widest balcony, top floor longest walk-up, but best view of sky. Closer in (blue balconies, 2nd & top floors) are \u201cSuperior Balcony\u201d \u2013 king beds on picture\u2019s south/left, double beds on north/right. View from the double bed rooms is slightly nicer because of some obstruction from the adjoining Hotel Alhambra. Same sky view situation as above. In the center (blue balconies, 2nd & top floors), looks wide but in actuality are connecting rooms - \u201cFamily Suites\u201d. Other room categories are scattered around the 1st floor and pool area. A little study of the TA and hotel site pictures and you\u2019ll figure out those room locations. Playa Maya\u2019s site is a little intimidating when you want to check out room availability. Once you hit the blue \u201cReserve\u201d button it asks you for your name, email address and dates before letting you see room availability. In the four years that they\u2019ve had my email address I\u2019ve never gotten any spam associated with this hotel. After entering your info, the next page shows some slightly different room descriptions. Don\u2019t worry, keep going \u2013 click something and the next page lets you select \u201cshow all availability for these dates\u201d along with the original room descriptions. After this, it\u2019s all routine \u2013 a couple of quick emails, some credit card deposit faxing (again, all legit) and then you can start going through the TA PDC forums to see the food and fun options.

The staff, as most people have mentioned, are terrific! Special mentions ( As Stephen the owner mention to me that the staff like this part!) go to Nora and Maria at reception. Angelina, our wonderful room cleaner for the week (and her great towel art every day!). Jesus for the great service for lunch and drinks on the beach. The breakfast that is included is of very good quality as are the lunches when we decided to eat at the hotel beach area. Security i there after 10pm which is a nice touch also. The location is very good, it is a reasonably quite part of PDC, (in July anyway) and you can walk down La Quinta every day and be hassled to purchase mostly tacky junk from the local stores. That was without a doubt, the worst part of Play del carmen, but obviously nothing to do with this great hotel! The beach is clean and the sand does not get hot under your feet here! ( No idea why...I did ask a few people but no one seemed to know). My wife and I stayed in room 303 which had a decent view of the beach and Caribbean sea. My son and Mother in law stayed in a standard room on the first floor. Both rooms are of equal size except room 103 has a very small balcony with room for only 1 chair. Our room had room for 2 chairs on the balcony. The rooms themselves are spacious and clean. the bathrooms are a little small, and you do get to hear your neighbours showering everyday, as each bathroom faces out onto a neighbouring balcony!!

This is a great hotel if you are looking for a nice, clean, and roomy place to stay directly on the beach. We booked 2 balcony rooms (superior and deluxe). The rooms had a dresser, closet, safe, and small refrigerator. I really appreciated the large towels in the bathroom. You rarely see hotels providing over-sized towels these days. We did have a little difficulty with the air conditioning at first, but found out we were setting the control on low instead of high. We did get the opportunity to check out other rooms at Playa Maya. The family suite is huge! If you are a couple or solor I definately recommend getting the deluxe or superior balcony room. I am glad that we did this. I like the views of Cozumel and the sea from these rooms. Breakfast is served in the dining room on the beach. We all ate the American breakfast the fast 2 days (eggs, bacon or ham, toast, and fruit). I then switched to pancakes a few times and then waffles. You can also order a lighter breakfast if desired. You do get your moneys worth in the amount of food served to you. Our nachos and chicken platter was full. It was also very tasty. One thing you MUST order is coconut shrimp. You get 6 jumbo shrimp in a mango sauce with rice and caulilower. I ate every drop of it! I had to compare this to the coconut shrimp that I age in Hawaii and this was probably better. There are beach chairs with umbrellas on the beach provided by the hotel. We spent time relaxing on the beach. It is nice being able to get up early in the morning and go for a swim. I need to comment on the staff. You will not find a friendlier or more helpful staff anywhere. We lost a new expensive digital camera while at Xel-Ha. Staff called the park every morning to check on the status of the camera. We did end up finding the camera. I can't thank the staff enough for their efforts in helping us.

On arrival, the hotel staff looked after us and made us feel most welcome. The hotel is right on the beach (only access is from the beach) and also in the centre of town - so no car was required - we walked everywhere. Food at the hotel - breakfast (excellent) and lunches on the beach (with drinks) was also very good and we always felt well looked after by the staff who ensured that enough chairs and umbrellas were available for us right through the day. An assortment of restaurants are all around the hotel and we visited a different one each night and relaxed with some nice food with a few drinks. We felt safe at all times at the hotel and each day the staff checked with me to ensure we were happy and asked if there were any problems - we had none!

If I told you everything wonderful about this hotel, it would only be repeating what so many have said before - it's great. The people there make the difference - I would name them all, but then this review would be too long - or I would forget someone!! We also made some new friends - from Canada and Syracuse, NY - I guess the best people just naturally stay at the best places! The restaurant serves delicious food, the drinks are great, the service is impeccable. We stayed in Rm 101 for 5 nites, but then had to move because we decided to stay for two more days and someone had specifically reserved the room we were in! We moved to Rm 102. Both are Deluxe Terrace w/ Hammock rooms. Rm 101 had a king bed, and Rm 102 had two doubles. But we actually liked 102 better - better (partial) ocean view and more shade in the morning as we drank our coffee on the terrace. Oh, and if you follow their instructions, and send someone around when you get there, they will come and get your bags so you don't have to \"drag them through the sand\". We got there at 9:00 p.m., and they were waiting for us and carried our heavy bags to the room. We were actually dropped off at 10th and 8th - the barricades were up - but it was a downhill two block walk to the beach down 8th - not bad at all. When we were picked up to leave they were able to come all the way down 8th - and again, our bags were carried across the sand for us. If there is anything you want, just ask. We had two Adirondack type chairs on our terrace - but it was difficult to get up out of them (we're old and out of shape) and we couldn't see over the terrace wall (too low to the ground) - so we asked if we could switch them out for two of the upright chairs like they had in the restaurant. No problem! Much more comfortable for us - and we could see! They even moved them again for us when we changed rooms. There are a lot of steps - and no elevator - so do consider that. Steve was very specific when we were deciding which room type we wanted - and it worked out fine. We couldn't have done the 2nd or 3rd floor balcony rooms. But we were perfectly happy where we were.

Be warned that the lines at immigration in Cancun can take up to 90 minutes to get through and that's even before Customs! If you arrange for pick-up like us (we used Cancun Shuttle) then just keep this in mind. Now that I know how well the ADO buses work I would even recommend getting one of those straight outside the terminal and pay less for the trip to Playa del Carmen. Trip would probably take around an hour. The first thing to note about the hotel is that the entrance is only accessible via the beach. If your transportation is allowed to pass through the pedestrian zone of 5th Avenue then the nearest street is 8th, right at the entrance to the beach itself. You walk on the sand around the Alhambra Hotel and Playa Maya is the next one to it. We were dropped off on 6th and we had to drag our luggage over the sand past several hotels. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we went straight to the hotel's restaurant and ordered some food and drinks. Both came very quickly and we enjoyed fresh salsa and chips, sandwich with fries and some shrimp. Jesus was our waiter all week long and he did a great job. My son was already changed and in the swimming pool. It's not very large but enough to cool you off in the hot sun. As soon as our room was ready we headed up to 204. It was cool and perfect for the 3 of us. It was very clean, comfortable and had a fantastic view of the ocean. There was even a little hammock chair on our balcony. Now I would say that the only downfall to the room was the small balcony because it would have been hard for all three of us to sit there at the same time. There was a small fridge in the room that already had a few sodas, beers, candy, and bottled water. The beach was right on our doorstep and the sand was white and fine, the water a bit strong but warm and beautiful. It was funny to see a two foot wall of sand all along the beach. There's still plenty to walk on but I feel that in a few years they may have to fill it in again. If you love shells then you are going to love this beach! Breakfasts were filling - the ones included in your room price are pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, juice and coffee. You can always get other things off the menu but you will have to pay for those. All this is served on the beach under the cabanas. Nothing like having sand between your toes early in the morning. Juan was the gentleman responsible for cleaning our room and he was brilliant. Not only did it always look immaculate but he made wonderful towel sculptures. The location of the hotel was perfect for walking along the many shops and restaurants of 5th Avenue. You will have many people trying to get your attention because they want to sell you a tour, or eat at their restaurant or buy silver and other stuff. Just keep walking if you are not interested. Plenty of yummy food out there - we ate at Agua Maya - tasty and fun to watch the waiters carrying drinks on their heads and then doing tricks with the flambees. Restaurant Parilla right on the corner of 8th and 5th was also extremely tasty. There is also plenty of gelato places and of course the American places like Subway, McDonalds, Haagen Daz if you need to eat that stuff. Try the really yummy sipping chocolate at Ah Cacao cafe - it's thick and sweet. We made trips to Xcaret Park and Tulum via the ADO buses and it worked out perfectly. The buses are air-conditioned and very comfortable and schedules and prices are good. The bus station is around 2nd and 5th Avenues. All in all this was an incredible family trip and I can't wait to return to Playa Maya hotel and Playa del Carmen sometime in the near future.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cBetter Late Than Never...

We love stretch of beach it is on .We loved our days lounging on our chairs under our umbrellas that had been set up for us.Jesus ,Carlos and Pedro were so attentive to us during our days to see if we wanted anything to drink or eat.I love the fact that you just run a tab and pay at the end that is so convenient so you don't need to bring cash down to the beach. This trip it was much warmer than last year when we were there so we used the pool as well as the ocean.It is a little pool but per sect for cooling off or a quick swim. The breakfast is a very generous portion.You get eggs ,meat a little fruit and toast ,coffee and juice.The service is great and so friendly . The rooms are a nice size with a small balcony .We had a hammock on ours and loved that. In our room we had a king bed that was very comfortable.The linens are nice and spotless.The bed is in between hard and soft ,we had no issues with it and slept very well each night.You may hear a little music from the hotel down the beach but really with the AC on not much at all.The rooms have a coffee pot in them with packets of coffee,that is nice if you are an early riser.My friend would get up each morning and sit on her balcony reading with her coffee until her husband woke.The decor is pleasant not too fancy. Again this year I will say honestly this is the CLEANEST hotel I have ever stayed in.Juan who cleaned our room for both stays does a super job.Everyday was spotless without a grain of sand to be found in the halls or our rooms.One day Kate went up to the room while he was working and he had the bed pulled out to the middle of the room cleaning under it.We tipped him well each day as he was a terrific cleaner and nice guy. We had lunch most days here as well and always had great food.I love the coconut shrimp but I think my new favorite is the fish tacos.My friend realy loved their soups and he is somewhat of a soup expert ,ha ha . Something we really enjoy about staying here is the size of the hotel.We were able to meet so many other guests.This makes it lots of fun,especially the one day when we had a storm and all gathered under the restaurants palapas for an impromptu party. Proximity to 5th Ave is super.Also a quick walk to Walmart or the Mega for supplies for the room. Booking handled very well and efficiently by Stephen .Any ?

Much thanks to all the folks who gave advice and especially to Steve who made the reservation and financial transaction secure, efficient and painless. Steve kept us thoroughly informed, sent some local information and ensured we were well taken care of. Ok, Arriving at Cancun airport: This airport itself can only be described as a disorganized disaster. The luggage and customs process (lines) are in real need of efficiency tweaking (they should hire Steve), spring-break mobs did not help the disorganization at all. ;). Anyway, once we retrieved our luggage and made it through customs we walked on by all the timeshare, cab and other transportation hawks and just kept walking to the end of the terminal, the entire process took about 40 \u2013 50 minutes. We stopped to change just a few dollars and headed out the door and went direct to the ADO buses. We were in luck and the bus was already at the gate and ready to roll. We bought our tickets for 110 pesos ($9) at the bus. The bus was basically empty for our 45 minute trip. GREAT way to travel, very comfortable, very clean and we highly recommend it! Any other mode of transportation is a rip off and you are just wasting your money. We arrived at the Playa del Carmen ADO bus station without incident, grabbed our bags and exited the bus station facing McDonalds on 5th Ave. We then made a left and strolled about four blocks down 5th avenue until 8th where we made a right towards the beach. When we hit the beach (150 - 160 yards), we turned right on the sand and approached Hotel Playa Maya (50 yards). One of the staff working on one of the Palapas once seeing us stopped working and immediately came and assisted us with our bags and escorted us to reception where Nora greeted us and made us feel very welcome. Check-in was fast and hassle free. Our room was not ready yet as we arrived around 10 am. However, our bags were secured and we were offered cold water, towels and asked to relax on the beach. We opted instead to go exploring on 5th and grab some lunch at one of the bazillion eateries lining the avenue. A cold Sol (a couple actually) and some chips and salsa while we watched all the folks walking by worked out fine. Around 2 p.m. we returned to Playa Maya and we were shown our room where we received an explanation of how everything in the room and hotel worked, breakfast times, TV, air conditioning, safe, etc. We stayed in room 301 (by far the best for ocean view on the premises and quiet, although there are no bad rooms), matter of fact we had an unobstructed view of the ocean even when lying in bed. The room itself was very clean and the maid kept it that way our entire stay. The bed was very comfortable, had several pillows and there was plenty of storage space unless you brought way too many things. Although, the bathroom could use a shelf for all that women stuff wives usually bring. The room also had a small table, two chairs, a fridge (stocked with two beers, two sodas and large bottled water \u2013 water only, is replenished daily), coffee pot, hair dryer, safe (uses a key which you must put the lock into the safe and then remove they key), great air-conditioning and a flat screen TV. Shower was large; had plenty of very hot water and the water pressure was fine. The balcony while very small fits two beach type chairs and a small drink table. It worked for us; we sat there at night or early morning for the fantastic breeze and beach watching. Towels and beach chairs with an umbrella are also provided with each room. The Playa Maya hotel staff was great, no make that fantastic! Everyone we encountered was very friendly and more than helpful. Food was good; drinks were cold and the beach was very nice (do not expect the super clean raked beaches of the big AI resorts. Way too many folks (slobs) unfortunately think the beach is a big personal ashtray and bottle cap receptacle. The beach chair area can get a bit crowded as chairs not being utilized by guests are rented out. However, this did not present any problems for us and we enjoyed every day. There were no large groups of spring breakers near the boutique hotels which was a welcome relief. All in all we had a fantastic mini vacation, great weather, great food and great staff. Highly recommended! Restaurants: Good restaurants are everywhere, read the reviews and print off the short and long list here on TA. I will say that we tried several, but found the best food at inexpensive prices at small mom & pop operations with just a few plastic chairs and tables with hardly any tourists. If you want excellent, inexpensive food, get off the big avenues and hit the side streets. Find El Fogon -- Tacos al Pastors is a must; do not let looks fool you. Also great is Las Cazuelas, and Las Brisas. Lastly, we would like to again thank and commend the entire staff at Playa Maya who ensured that our ever need was taken care of and our vacation was fantastic. They all went beyond just doing their job, they made our time with them fun, and ensured that we will be annual visitors.

Booking with Steve exclusively through email was different but simple. He's never more than a few hours max to return any questions. Paying without actually talking to someone was a first for us.

My only critiscism was that despite me asking for a quiet room I was in one just around the corner from reception area which meant I had to hear people milling about in the morning. Pay a bit more and you might get a room on a higher level where noise shouldnt be an issue. That said I put a couple of earplugs in and it was fine. In general I found Playa more touristy then I was used to. It's no Cancun but its still a major resort and not really a conventional town where the locals interact with travellers other then serving them at bars, shops and resturants. If you want to see some local colour get off 5th Avenue and go for a walk around. You will have wasted your time just hanging on the beach and seeing the very toursity 5th avenue. Saying that ,5th Ave has some suprisingly hip bars and restuarants The beach is wonderful if a little crowded. For those who want something a little more chilled I would suggest a colectivo ride to Akumal down the coast where you can snorkel with turtles on palm fringed beaches. I also recommend a visit to Coba, some jungle ruins where yuo can pretend you are Indiana Jones and climb one of the temples.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cPerfection on the Beach\u201d", "Author": "cltutell", "ReviewID": "UR90577926", "Content": "The Playa Maya was the perfect hotel for our stay in Playa del Carmen.

The room included a small coffee pot which was a nice addition from the last time we stayed. Also the new beach was amazing, the last time we were there was before the major beach restoration, it was a much wider beach this time. The only negative thing I can think of was the pool seemed to have a film on it, which made it not so inviting, and it is very small. Not a big deal to us at all because we would rather swim in the ocean anyways but if you are looking for a hotel to swim in the pool this place wouldn't be for you.

The only entrance/exit to the hotel is via the beach, which was slightly annoying as you'd always get sand in your shoes - but it always reminded us where we were! Our room was on the ground level between the pool and the reception - so to ensure privacy we always had to keep the curtains closed so we generally felt a little cooped in if we returned to the room during the day. In hindsight, I would have paid the extra to have one of the rooms higher up in the main building.

Do not hesitate to stay at Playa Maya! This was the best choice we made and love this hotel for many reasons. Location, employees, cleanliness and the fact it is right on the beach. We arrived, were quickly checked in and on the beach within 15 minutes. Room was much larger than others I have stayed in and the beds were very comfortable. Small refrigerator was stocked with different types of soda, a few beers and large bottle of water. Bathroom and shower was perfect size. Never had an issue with water pressure or hot water. I couldn\u2019t get over how clean the room was. I always seem to find something wrong with a room and I could truthfully say I don\u2019t have one complaint. Juan did a wonderful job keeping our room spotless and making the most beautiful towel art. Every morning we sat on the deck by the pool and enjoyed a cup of coffee, checked our email and the walked a few steps to the beach for breakfast. The breakfast that is included in the room price is wonderful. Eggs, bacon/ham, toast or your choice of pancakes or waffles. I don\u2019t remember everything that you can choose from but there are four different combinations. The best thing about this is you are right on the beach. Nothing like greeting the morning on the beach looking at the ocean for as far as you can see. Employees were very attentive and always were there with more coffee or juice. Playa Maya is perfectly located. Close to everything, especially the hustle and bustle of 5th Avenue but far enough away from the evening noise. Right up the beach is Fusion and Bad Boys Beach Bar all within walking distance. Employees and everyone we met was very friendly and greeted us by our names. Nora and Maria at the front desk always had a smile and the waiters couldn\u2019t do enough for us. They anticipated our every need and were always available to answer any questions we had about Playa, dinner choice or nightlife. There is a small pool but with the beach right there we didn\u2019t use it. They were replacing the hot tub so we didn\u2019t get to try that but will next time. Speaking of the beach the water was wonderful. Sand like flour and water was calm and peaceful. I didn\u2019t come across any rocks or major seaweed. Umbrellas were placed strategically between the comfortable lounge chairs and drinks and food are brought to your chair whenever you want. One thing I must mention is the owner of this wonderful hotel. Out of the blue a hurricane popped up two days prior to our trip and was headed for the Yucatan. The day before we were to leave he emailed me as well as personally called to let us know all fees would be waived if we would like to cancel and postpone our trip. He was very personable and genuinely concerned. Unfortunately or should I say fortunately our airline would not postpone our flight without a fee so we decided to go. Thankfully the hurricane was very small and turned a little further north so Playa was unscathed. Beautiful weather for our trip! As soon as I got home he emailed me again to inform me that I left something in the room. How honest his employees are! He was so kind to notify me before I even realized it was not in my possession. The employees tried to come after us to give me the item but we were gone. We used Cancun Express to get to and from the airport and they were there waiting for us so we left immediately. Now he\u2019s working on a way for me to get my items without having to pay an exorbitant fee for shipping internationally.

Through the recommendations of a friend, they suggested Playa del Carmen. A little touristy, but close to a lot of things. Now, the most important decision, accommodations. Do we go all inclusive, boutique or somewhere in between. We are not big all you can eat people, or all the watered down drinks you can drink people. I spent about a week picking out possibilities and zeroed in on Playa Maya. Playa Maya is a smaller hotel, with only 18 rooms. However, it is one of the only smaller hotels that is nestled right on the beach. Location, location, location. You are also about the midway point on 5th street, so right in the mix of it. However, you can't see it from 5th Street. This is good, because at night, you do not hear any of the noise from the local clubs or bars, which can be an issue with some of the places that back up to 5th. It is technically at the corner of 8th and 5th....but on the beach. Your cab can take you down to the beach, he just has to signal to the Cop that typically is directing traffic at the corner by that time of the day. So, the amenities: We got a standard balcony and for 7 days it was $575 a pretty solid deal. Couple that with $600 for R/T airfare for two, it was a cheap vacation. The room was actually pretty big. Everyday, after the room service fixed up the room, we found a new towel animal. My wife loves these, I could take it or leave it. We still had a partial ocean view, even though we did not pay for one. The staff, I would say, is the second part of this equation that really made this an awesome trip. They are all really nice, and we especially enjoyed Lucio who was our waiter at the restaurant on the beach and the front desk staff. Don't worry about not speaking Spanish down here, most of them speak adequate English. You will not find a better place to eat, especially for the price, than the little beach restaurant at Playa Maya. You should really try the Octopus Tacos, they were phenomenal. It is opened everyday until 6pm. They will also bring you out food and drinks to your chairs if you desire. Every room comes with a daily continental breakfast. It is not what you would consider an \"American Continental\" breakfast (ie: an apple and muffin). It is in fact a full breakfast, eggs, meat, toast, potatoes and of course some type of pico di gallo. If you like habinero (which I do) you will love PdC, as it comes with every meal. Another important note, the section of the beach Playa Maya is on is perfect as there are not very many people there and they always had beach chairs open. What a lot of people fail to realize is the larger accommodations you stay in (number of guests/rooms) the more people the hotel has to cram into a small section of beach. This was by far the number one complaint other travelers voiced to us while we were out on town. No problem here, as there are only 18 rooms. You are also very close to the ferry to Cozumel; about a 5-10 minute walk. The water is crystal clear. On the days we didn't have a near miss from a tropical storm, it was incredible. They have a small pool, but it is mostly for decoration, no one ever gets in it. I only have one con, and its not that big of one. Since none of the bathrooms have fans in them (typical for most hotels-fire hazard), they have vents that either open directly to the outside, or into the hallway. Our vent opened up right around the corner from the Check-in desk, so you can imagine mornings where I had just a little bit too much habinaro and beer; we usually just ran the water to mask any noise. Others in the hotel, must not have realized that and I'll just leave it at that. Overall, I would say this hotel is perfect if you are looking for that quiet, beachfront and relaxing vacation. We had fantastic service and a great time.

Loved the decor - really felt like I was actually in Mexico and not in a large international hotel/resort. The rooms are fine - not marble/gold however very large, huge bed, spotlessly clean with fantastic views. We were in room 301 which was full oceanview. The staff were all fantastic. Everyone seemed to really enjoy working there. Alex (barman) served the best margarita's we tried in Playa (we tried a few) and the shrimp tacos on the beach were unbelievable.

The beach in front of the hotel is lovely, with 2 rows of chairs including 1 right near the water. Apparently this wasn't permitted until recently. The front desk staff are sweet as can be and very eager to help. The restaurant serves the best Mexican food in the area. It's too bad they're only open for breakfast and lunch. I could live on their chips and Playa Maya shrimp. Most of the other places near 5th Avenue serve food that is either overpriced or mediocre. Speaking of which, Carboncitos is sooooo overrated. A couple of doors down on the beach is a place called Fusion. They have nice beachfront seating and great live music at night. If you want bargains and feel a little adventurous, venture far off 5th Avenue. You'll also escape the incredibly annoying and sketchy hawkers who'll have you saying \"No Gracias\" in your sleep after a couple of days. Go out of your way to load up on 10 peso coins. It seems like NO ONE has change in Mexico. This is true at the hotel, in restaurants, and in taxis. It got really annoying, unless you don't care about tipping people. Speaking of taxis... they're all looking to rip you off. Each one will quote you a different price for the same trip. This place desperately needs metered cabs. As far as service goes, don't expect people to fall over themselves trying to anticipate your requests.

After reading countless reviews last year, and despite the swine flu scare, my husband and I traveled to and stayed at Playa Maya for five days in 2009. What an incredible experience! Never in the time we've been together have we repeated a vacation destination, but this place warrants a return visit. That being said, I don't think we were even home a month last year and we began making plans for our return. This property is owned and managed by a gentleman named Steve who lives in the U.S. and corresponds solely via e-mail. Initially, I thought this might pose a problem...boy was I wrong. With ease I was able to ask questions, make reservations, and secure payment. All of his responses were timely, and prior to leaving I printed out my correspondence and receipts to make check-in and potential upgrades easier. That brings me to the staff at Playa Maya. What a competent group of individuals! Nora personally greets you daily, and not only is quick to offer a smile and helpful guidance, but exhibits a genuine interest in hearing about your plans for the day. Likewise, Pablo, who works 2nd shift, was always willing to assist us with our tours and offer some wonderful restaurant recommendations. I must say what impressed me the most was the work ethic demonstrated by all the individuals at Playa Maya. There are not too many places in the U.S. that could be managed from abroad as successfully. Upon arrival I inquired about a possible upgrade and was offered their \"A\" suite. Right up front, I was told that there was a possibility we may have to move at some point. However, since this stay was for a greater length of time, my husband and I opted for this extra space and we were not disappointed. The suite is located in front of the hotel entrance near the pool. We had a kitchen area complete with coffeemaker, fridge, and microwave, as well as dishes and storage containers. The hotel initially stocks the fridge with assorted beverages, provides a large bottle of water daily, and even had a canister of coffee for us to use. Closet space was ample and we could easily unpack and settle in. Noise was never a factor, and we enjoyed the close proximity to the pool and sundeck. Pablo kept us posted about our move, and as it turns out we only needed to relocate for the last two nights of our stay. Again we were given the opportunity to upgrade, and we spent our last two nights in a second floor room with an incredible ocean view! Housekeeping services and creativity with decorative towel art was impeccable throughout our stay. Daily breakfast is included, and choices are both ample and delicious. Coconut shrimp and fish tacos were an amazing lunch choice, and afternoon cocktails were generous in size. Thanks to all the guys, Lucio, Othman, Jesus, Carlos, and Peter, for your attentiveness, and for never letting my husband's coffee run out! The beach area has been renovated and is quite expansive when compared to last year. The hotel provides you with daily beach towels, upon your return of the used, and Alberto was always at the ready to set up an umbrella once our chairs had been selected. I must also say that the hotel now has a night guard. Although I never felt my safety was in question, it was nice to know that someone was actually there and was diligently checking room keys. Personally speaking, I admire the work that goes into Playa Maya everyday. It still amazes me to watch the employees completely assemble and disassemble the restaurant and beach area daily...no easy feat! I think we all should remember that unlike in the U.S., these individuals work for very meager wages and still manage to smile and accommodate. If we can't learn a lesson from their action, perhaps we could tip appropriately for the niceties we\"re afforded! As far as our transfers and excursions,my husband does extensive reading and researching prior to any vacation. Fortunately, this often allows us to not only make the most of our time, but also of our money. First and foremost you should know that the public transportation system, or ADO bus, is a motorcoach complete with comfortable, air-conditoned seating, full length movies(in Spanish of course), and a bathroom. The ADO bus services the Cancun airport, and will transfer you to the bus station which is a short walk from Playa Maya for under $20. Just be patient! Upon arrival, there may not be a bus waiting, but there will be plenty of people and taxis trying to convince you to use their services for about triple the cost. Stop at information and ask for the ADO window...they're available in both terminals. We used the ADO buses throughout our stay, taking it to Xcaret, Coba, and finally back to the airport. Purchasing tickets was easy and they accept credit cards. It's recommended that you buy your return ticket to the airport the day before. Although they have a continual schedule starting early in the morning, you don't want to be told that the bus is full when you have a flight to catch. Speaking of flights and airports, do yourself a favor and eat or bring food with you to the airport...$6 dollars is a little crazy for a bag of M&M's Our excursions included a full day snorkel tour with Mexico Blue Dream, parasailing, Ek Balam and Rio Lagartos with Aldebaran tours, and as previously mentioned Coba and Xcaret. All experiences were amazing and highly recommended. Please e-mail me should you have any specific questions, or look for individual reviews that I will post about the specific tour companies listed. As far as dining experiences, we ate at different restaurants everyday...there's too many not to. The only one I would avoid is Casa Adela. Although I had read positive reviews, and the atmosphere was eclectic and interesting, I felt rushed, food quality was mediocre, and my 3 a.m. wake up call was a reminder for me not to repeat or recommend this experience. So many good choices, El Fogon, Java Joe's, Los Rancheros, El Pirata, Ajua Maya(amazing flambee), La Pesca, Carlos & Charlies, Tropical, Ristorante Da Bruno, 100% Natural, La Bodeguita(awesome atmosphere and Cuban food), Gelato Factory, Caio Gelato, Aldo Gelato, Dairy Queen, and Ah Cacao. Also, don't be afraid to eat from the street vendors by the ferry dock...great chorizo tacos and fresh fruit cups for under $5! I realize that I may have been a bit long winded, but with that being said, I certainly hope that I was able to convey some helpful insight. Will we return to Playa Maya?...we're already talking about it and we've only been home for 12 days. While 5th avenue and the shopping (hawkers) gets played out quickly, we both agree we would return not only to the sanctuary of Playa Maya, but to see the friends we made along the way!

The only entrance to the hotel is from the beach- no street access. You have to walk on the beach past the Hotel Alhambra which is on the corner. This makes it a quiet location- no street sounds at night or loud clubs nearby, although music was played at the outdoor restaurant and by the neighboring hotels most of the day. You could often hear 3 different kinds of music being played at once while sitting on the beach relaxing. Suggest bringing ear plugs or your own MP3. The rooms are very small and basic. Don't recommend for more than 2 people. Mini fridge chilled very well, was stocked with bottled water. Bathrooms have built-in hairdyers, are very small and have little counter space or storage space for personal items. Our shower pressure was very low, but was fixed after we brought it to their attention. They even let us use the shower in another room until ours was repaired. Very impressive service by the front desk staff. We were given room 301 first because of the nicer view, but it had a king size bed (we had requested 2 doubles) and the balcony was tiny, only big enough for 2 chairs. They moved us to room 102 which was a little more spacious and had a large terrace with hammock, 2 lounge chairs and a small built-in table w/ 2 stools. Lots of space to dry your wet stuff in the sun. Room 102 was very conveniently located, which we really liked. Easy in & out for anyone who wants to avoid stairs, since there is no elevator. You have to walk up & down some stairs just to get into the hotel, so it is not handicap accessible. The A/C worked really well, though the remote control is a bit tricky. They have cable TV, with most channels in Spanish with subtitles. 2 or 3 channels in English. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. There is no clock in the room- we used the TV guide channel to tell time, and used the hotel wake-up call service when needed. Amenities are minimal. Nice open air restaurant on the sand, serving breakfast & lunch, with free breakfast for hotel guests. Recommend ordering the fruit plate, pancakes or scrambled eggs (w/cheese). Real good chicken nachos and ceviche. I tried the coconut shrimp because of all the rave reviews I read here, but found it to be overhyped. Too sweet for my taste. Service was very good, and you could even get food brought to your beach chair. The very small unheated swimming pool was cold & could not be used until May or June. The outdoor jacuzzi does not use hot water. It is the same temp as the pool, which was a big disappointment on the cool breezy days. The beach chairs are comfortable, with cushions on them. Apparently there is a local ordinance that does not allow placement of beach chairs more than 20 meters from the hotel. About 80% of the width of the beach is not chair-accessible. Unless you bring your own. (strange but true). This causes everyone to be packed close to each other. My husband moved our chairs closer to the water one morning and they warned us that was illegal, and moved the chairs back. Police on ATVs are regularly patroling up and down the beach and several life guard stations are nearby. You will be constantly approached by locals selling goods or services, which can get annoying when you're trying to relax, but they are not aggressive. The beach has been replenished and is now very wide and very nice. There was some seaweed floating in the water, not that big a deal, and the clarity was not what we have experienced in the past, probably due to recent rain and high winds. We are used to being able to see our feet when standing in the water, and this time visibility was maybe a foot or two. But when we went out scuba diving the visibility was much better, about 50-60 feet. One major advantage of staying here is that you don't need a car or taxi. Everything you could possibly need is in walking distance, and the terrain is so flat, you can walk pretty far very easily. Recommend walking down to Playa Mart located on 5th Ave. across from the ferry dock pier to get basic necessities, snacks, drinks, and souveniers (they take credit cards, which many stores don't). 5th Avenue is a pedestrian-only commercial zone about 2 miles long. This is the \"touristy\" part of PDC, kind of like a beach boardwalk, lined with shops, bars, restaurants, gelato/ice cream shops, good for strolling and people-watching. This is a great place to stay if you're looking for a basic, clean oceanfront room at a reasonable price, and plan to eat out and spend most of your time outdoors. If you are accustomed to all-inclusive resorts and high-end hotels with lots of amenities, you might want to look elsewhere.

I POURED over tripadvisor when I planned our vacation & was SO happy that all those previous reviews were exactly right - I HAD indeed found the best beachfront hotel there was! We even decided to stay a bit longer than originally planned because of what a great time we were having, but they were booked after our reserved time. So, we just went over to Cozumel & tried out an all-inclusive. We quickly learned that that was NOT for us & that the charm, calmness & personal attention at Playa Maya was definitely the best. Oh, and we stayed in both the beachview & the garden room (we knew beforehand that we'd need to change rooms due to being booked). I must say that we thoroughly enjoyed both rooms. The beachview was, of course, beautiful, but the quiet, pretty garden space with a jacuzzi for the 2 of us was wonderful as well.

Our trip was originally scheduled for the first week in May, during the height of the swine flu scare. Steve was more than accommodating in allowing us to cancel our reservation. We were very fortunate to be able to rebook for early December and the email reservation process was very easy. The first word I look for in any hotel review is CLEAN.....and the Playa Maya is CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN. The staff is wonderful.....friendly and attentive. LOCATION is perfect.....right on the beach, yet only one block from 5th. Included breakfasts are great. Enjoyed our evening strolls on 5th and trying a different restaurant for dinner every night. The pool is small, but we never used it, with the beach and ocean right out our front door. I would have liked a coffeemaker in our room, but this turned into a non-issue since fresh coffee was available in the lobby every morning at 7am. One morning, the beautiful sunrise woke me earlier.....took an enjoyable and uncrowded walk on 5th and found a Starbuck's a block away that opened at 6:30am (only made it there that one time). In my opinion, this is the perfect hotel for those travelers who would like to have a non-AI experience.

Our main reason for the change was cost. As a teacher, I am pretty locked in when it comes to travel during the school year. That means I can go only at the peak times, like Christmas. When we started researching our trip, we found that AI prices at this time were sky high, so we decided to find a small hotel in the heart of Playa. We made a list of our must haves for a hotel, and then started at the top of TA\u2019s list of hotels until we found the one with everything on our list. Playa Maya was the hotel we found, and wow, are we glad we did! I have to repeat what all the other reviews have said. The staff is what makes this place special! Everyone from the front desk people to the waiters to the cleaning staff went out of the way to make our stay incredible. We had a slight problem with our toilet the first night. We called the front desk, and someone was in our room within 1 minute to fix it. That is service you don\u2019t get at very many places! I think the people alone are the reason we will return. Even booking was a breeze with Steve. We ended up changing our reservation, and he directed to the room type that best met our needs. He really payed attention to what we wanted. We had room 301, which is a superior balcony on the top floor. It was perfect. We had a great view of the beach, there was a small balcony to sit on, and we could listen to the waves in the evenings. We would have liked to sleep with the patio doors open, but music from some of the beach bars was a little loud. That\u2019s okay, because it got pretty warm without the AC anyway. We thought the room was a nice size for our needs, and the bed and pillows were nice and comfy. The bottled water daily was really nice, and we like the fridge in the room too. Breakfast on the beach was fantastic. As others have said, there is nothing like having your toes in the sand right away in the morning! The included breakfast was more than enough for us, and the variety kept us satisfied all seven days, so we never ventured off resort. We really liked being able to get up from breakfast, walk a few feet, and be at our beach chairs for the day. Drinks and lunch were great too. We ate lunch here five times, we had drinks daily, and our bill at the end of the week was under $150 US, which we thought was really reasonable. Their Miami Vices are fabulous, by the way! :-) At night, we walked a block up the street to 5th Avenue, then meandered up and down side streets and the main drag. We never had a bad meal, although some stood out more than others. We loved El Bistro at La Tortuga, Bistro 524, and Carboncitos. We watched the Packers win at Tequila Barrel, the Badgers win at Bistro 524, and Minnesota lose at Carlos and Charlies and from the comfort of our balcony! There is nothing about our trip that we would change, except to make it longer if we could! Thank you to everyone at Playa Maya for making our vacation special.

The room we stayed in #303 (superior oceanview) had a very small balcony with a nice oceanview. The neighbors bathroom window was on our balcony, kinda awkward but not too big of a deal. The one thing we thought the room was missing was a coffee pot. We like to get up early and sit and watch the sunrise from our balcony with a cup of coffee. We had to bring our own coffee pot which again wasnt too big of a deal but it would have been nice to just have one in our room. The location of this hotel is awesome. It is literally steps from calle 8 and 1 block up is 5th Ave. Right along calle 8 there is a little mini mart and currency exchange which was nice. The beach at the hotel seems to change day to day. When we first arrived it was really rocky, then mid trip it seemed to rebuild itself, then by the end of our trip back to being very rocky. This was a concern we had because we saw it from other posters pictures but it was not a big deal at all though because just steps down was a nice sandy beach. The staff at this hotel were really wonderful. They were all such nice people. They made us feel so welcome. Aide at the front desk was so sweet and Luicio one of the waiters on the beach did such an awesome job taking care of us on our trip. The free breakfast was very good, you could choose from eggs or pancakes with bacon or ham and it came with coffee or tea, juice and toast. The fish tacos and the chicken nachos were great for lunch.

But the best of all, and the reason Playa maya is 5 out of 5, is that you get all this at very reasonable prices! This is saying something especially the way prices have gone up in Playa on the beach over the past few years. We split our time between a standard room and a jr suite, and with the discount for a week, we ended paying barely over 100 bucks a night even with the taxes included per night. So 50 bucks a night for each of us for THIS place! Of course if you want Ritz rooms or something, there are many other places you can look at. And look at their prices, too! LOL We had nice clean comfy rooms with great AC and some late night TV to relax with if we weren't out or to catch up with the news on and all, and the kitchenette was nice in the jr suite one evening, though we usually ate out. Which reminds me, great food at their restaurant! We both thought it was as good as anywhere else we ate on our trip. We also recommend Carbonsitos, which they told us about at the desk. Easy short walk, but about everything is! In short, this is a great affordable beach hotel in Playa and you will only be disappointed if you are looking for luxury setting and amenities.

We had difficulty accessing the Internet through wifi but were able to check email on a PC available in a sitting room. There were experimenting at the time, hopefully it works now and is not too onerous. Staff was friendly although it seemed like there was some competition among restaurant staff over who had main access to customers (for tips or referrals?). A lot in Playa del Carmen has to do with referring tourists to attractions and one can sometimes feel the pressure. On the other hand it's nice when you get to have a friendly chat about places to visit. I regret this type of hotel doesn't offer a formula that would include breakfast and a meal. Cost of meals are for us a big deterrent in traveling and food was not particularly cheap in Playa del Carmen. The only alternative would have been an \"all inclusive\" in Cancun which I wanted to avoid. We were looking for something more authentic with more ties with the local community. Some rooms offer a kitchenette which may help. My big issue was that one person who cleaned our room had a really bad cold (seemed like flu) and could barely speak. I was sick a few days after I returned. Given that flu and Mexico made big headlines as early as May I would have expected the staff to have been trained adequately.

I spent a lot of time reading these boards to try and decide where to stay and what to do. Everyone seemed to really like Playa Maya. It also seemed that there was a lot of repeat business and I love that. You can't beat the price of Playa Maya...considering $160 was for the best Ocean View rooms that is fantastic. I emailed Steve and he gave us an amazing room on the 3rd floor. (302). It was exactly like the pictures online. The room was spacious and clean with complimentary welcome drinks in the fridge. When we arrived it was early and the room wasn't quite ready yet so we went outside to eat. Now I had read a lot about the food everywhere and I knew that while I was there I would be trying the coconut shrimp and the fish tacos. On day 1 I chose the Coconut Shrimp with a Dos Equiis and my husband had the chicken tacos. The food was amazing! The service was also top notch. Very attentive and friendly. Throughout the week we sporadically spent time in the beach chairs at Playa Maya and ate lunch or a snack there 4 times. I never had a bad meal. The fish tacos were everything I hoped they were and I really love their Pico De Gallo--so fresh. The staff was so helpful to us and we got to meet Steve who was really nice and had a lot of great information. I would absolutely stay here again. I just want to address a couple things people complain about... The bed.....we loved it. I do not think it is hard at all...makes me wonder if those people are used to super crazy soft beds? We both thought it was great. The beach in front...yes there are some rocks right in the front..actually great for when you are staring at the ocean...noone is right in front of you! All you had to do was walk about 50-60 feet in either direction and there is completely clear water. My husband did a lot of snorkeling out front and he saw all kinds of stuff including a baby octopus! I love this place! My ONLY complaint....that the restaurant is not open late enough !

As for activities, we did absolutely nothing on this trip...it was perfect! We've been to the area several times in the past and have done plenty of tours and such...this trip was for relaxation and I have to say it was a very successful trip thanks to Playa Maya! Our biggest excursion was a walk to El Fagon for tacos one day, very good by the way. We also tried Babe's Noodle Bar and, while the frozen drinks were very good, we did not enjoy the food at all. We had dinner one night at 100% Natural where the food was good but service a bit slow. I have a feeling our food was ready but not served promptly as it was not hot when it arrived. Mosquitos were plentiful in the garden area at 100% Natural especially since we went after dark and after there had been some rain. Certainly can't fault the restaurant for that, just mentioning because and we were sorry we hadn't brought insect repellent. Our favorite restaurant, as usual, is Carboncitos.

The location is quiet, but within walking distance of more restaurants, bars and shops than one could possibly check out in a typical vacation. While it was relaxing for us to have the area very uncrowded, it is terrible for the local economy. Most nights we were the only diners in the restaurants.

Honestly, we could hear voices and the phone ringing in the reception area if we were in the room during the day, but as we weren't in the room too much except to sleep, it wasn't too disturbing. 2) Our bed was not that comfortable, which was unfortunate. 3)Reception doesn't like to give out more than one towel per guest per day for the beach. I can understand this, but still, it was a minor inconvenience 4) More of a suggestion, I think the hotel should put some mats down between the enterance to the hotel (off the beach) and the street.

The hotel is totally spotless, spotless, spotless. I always am on high bug alert and I didn't see one bug, anywhere, not even outside, of this wonderful gem. The complimentary breakfast is a great jumpstart to the day and the fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing. I loved the fact that you could open a tab for the entire week and settle up before checkout- no carrying around of cash- kind of like the all inclusive but way better. It's the little things here that matter that you just can't get at the big resorts. The little book exchange in the lobby, the free internet room that never seemed to be busy, the hot coffee and snacks in the lobby, the general feeling of intimacy- unforgettable. I almost couldn't wait to get home so I could tell everyone I knew how awesome it was! But, overall, the best part of this place is the staff! Never, have I come across staff that were so dedicated, friendly, hard working and gracious. You guys are truly awesome- they carried my bags with a smile, cleaned my room to utter perfection, knew exactly who I was from the first day on and brought me my coffee and juice on the beach without being asked, offered friendly advice and a smile each and every time. I am not sure what they are doing, but whatever it is they have an incredible group of employees and they are a huge part of what makes this place so special. There was one day after the bar and restaurant had closed; in fact, we were heading out for dinner, and the restaurant staff, that had been there from about 7 am, were pressure washing all of the table cloths and doing a real scrub down- I was truly amazed- you just don't see that!

Most of the other reviews here are fairly accurate and we had similar experiences. Just keep in mind that this is a small stand alone hotel , not an all -inclusive resort. First of all, they really do come running to take your bags once you arrive! The front desk reception was very organized and helpful. The property is exceptionally clean and well maintained. The bedding and towels are in very good condition; nothing is threadbare or worn out. We had a Superior room with balcony and very comfortable (firm) king bed.

TV is nice but most programming is en espanol. Get out on the beach ! Speaking of that, the restaurant is also very clean and the service very fast and friendly. The breakfast choices that are included with the room are limited but good. The lunch menu is excellent ... we had the fish tacos, nachos and the seafood cocktail all of which were delicious ! Get out on the beach early to reserve a chair and umbrella. The hotel also furnishes oversized beach towels. The beach is clean. There are a few vendors who can be annoying but in general the beach is safe and enjoyable. One of the good things about the location is that Playa Maya is close to 5th Ave but far enough away to avoid the obnoxious noise. You won't hear the crowds or loud bands but the building is not soundproof and you will hear normal hotel noise; your fellow guests moving about, doors slamming, loud conversations etc. We could ramble on about details but wont'.. just be assured that it's comfortable, clean, not a lot of frills but in a fantastic location with good service !!", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cLoved it, friendly and helpful staff.

It is such a good location, just off 5th ave and Right On the beach. Having to walk on sand to reach the hotel was a first for us! Thankfully a porter welcomed us at the base of Calle 8 and picked up some bags. Our first room, 204 was quite comfortable with small patio and a lovely view of the water. It was a very quiet room which was excellent. We ended up needing to stay another night and luckily due to a cancellation we were able to. The second room was 3 something and it was slightly louder, the sounds from 5th ave came in through the west facing windows and bathroom shutter window. The sounds died down around 1am. The other members of my family slept right through it though so it's not a major issue. It's certainly WAY quieter than a street facing hotel would be. There was a bit of an ant issue in the third floor room as well. After reading reviews before we arrived we were careful not to eat in the room or leave crumbs around. The hotel is trying to stay on top of the ant situation and the front desk attendant was apologetic when we checked out. The hotel provides a selection of drinks upon your arrival. Having a fridge is a bit plus! There are purified water jugs for water bottle refills available on the stair landings. The pool is small and chilly and the hot-tub is \"not a hot-tub\" to the dismay of my little girl who really wanted to try it out. We didn't go in the pool but saw others enjoying it. The lounge chair sundeck area seemed popular, too. We mostly enjoyed the immediate beach access with comfortable lounges and available umbrellas. The water was great for dipping in and a bit of swimming, though it's a bit too rough for littler kids. We loved being right on the beach. Some days were quite windy, but we were able to enjoy breakfast at the beach restaurant anyway. Tasty coffee. We ate in town most days as we like to try out various restaurants. Still, the included breakfast options are a pretty good deal. Minuses for me would be the room lighting - the bed lighting is too bright and direct for one person to be able to read while another rests or sleeps, and the light quality is a bit cold. A lamp could warm up the room a bit, and perhaps another type of CFL bulb with warmer tones. It was practically impossible to enter the room without having sand on our feet. We used the foot wash upon entering the grounds, too. Maybe another foot station would be helpful, further in, maybe with a mat to walk on? Not a huge deal, but it does feel a bit gritty underfoot (though they sweep and mop when they clean) and you definitely need to wipe/shake off your feet before getting in bed. The (free) computer room was handy and usually available with a short wait. Wireless was $5/day, but the signal was quite powerful in the rooms if you choose to pay for it. The hotel provides beach towels and there is a free in-room safe. We walked everywhere from the hotel. Playa del Carmen is a very walking oriented town, at least in the tourist areas, including the ferry dock, bus station, colectivo pickup area (although watch the \"sidewalks\") and of course Avenida 5 and its cross-streets. We might stay in the northern area next time, just for the very different feel. A lovely hotel. The super-friendly staff makes it all the more enjoyable.

The minute you arrive, people are jumping to help carry your bags up to your room, and they're always smiling and more then welcome to help you out. The staff was fantastic!! I stayed in the Deluxe Family Suite with my family and we loved it! The air conditioning worked very well and you can adjust it to the exact temperature you want for your room. The room was great for what you paid for. The shower is roomy (which was a plus for my fiance who's 6'7\") and had good water pressure. My family had three rooms on two different floors and never had an ant problem so it's safe to say that it's not a huge problem with the hotel. The property is fantastic and is right in the center of everything! The ferry dock to Cozumel is a five minute walk and you're minutes away from fifth avenue. Our cleaning guy (Juan) was fantastic! He always tried to communicate with me (even with the little spanish i knew!) and he was very friendly! He always accomadated me and my family and made our trip even better. Every day there was a new towel sculpture on our bed which was a nice touch! Also, we ate at the hotel every day for breakfast and lunch. Not only was the food very reasonable (250$ bill for four people for a week!!) but it was very very good!!! I would definately agree with everyone else and say try the coconut shrimp! Also try the chilaquiles for breakfast! Very good! The staff also are very eager to set up beach chairs and umbrellas for you which was great! Some of the downfalls. I also booked my transportation through Get Dita and didn't have any problem with it. The people before had problems finding it when they landed but all you had to do is ask and your pointed right in the direction and your transportation is there very quickly (no waiting!! very nice). We arranged to have them bring us back to the airport after and they were late, but i think that is usual for Playa Del Carmen because when we arranged to have a different company bring us to our activities, they were late as well. Yes, the pool is very small and it's shaped in a way that makes actually swimming in it interesting, but I never used it once when the ocean was at my front door!! The beach is a tad rocky but it never bothered me the least bit and I still thought that it was great. They do run out of beach towels for people to use so I would recommend that you bring your own if you aren't an early riser. Overall, I have no complaints about the hotel or it's staff.

After reading all of the Trip Advisor reviews we were excited about our stay and figured that this hotel would be perfect since Playa from what I remembered was a very quaint simple town. I'll start with the good. The hotel is centrally located right off of 8th street and only steps away from all of the excitement of 5th St. We only paid $100.00 per night and got the last night free with breakfast included everyday. The room was clean and had a king size bed, flat screen, small table and chair, mini fridge and the bathroom had excellent water pressure. The hotel is right on the beach so you can go from your room, to breakfast and then to lay out all in about 30 seconds. The staff was all very nice and accommodating and all the food we ate at the hotel was good and priced on the lower side. With the exception of the Margaritas which were in all honesty non alcoholic. Oh, and the pool is itty bitty and configured in a really bizarre way which we already new due to the pictures but it was funny to see up close and personal. The bad . . . The hotel recommends Dita Transportation on their website and for $60.00 per person round trip you get taken to and from Cancun International. Well, I made the reservation with this company and made a mistake when booking and it took about 6 emails and a 20 minute conversation ( which I'll be paying for on my phone bill ) to fix. In my opinion, it was a simple fix and I was just going to give the company some additional money upon my arrival but they were unable to find my reservation at first and then it was a while before they confirmed that I could just in fact pay the additional amount upon my arrival. Plus, once we arrived they were no were to be found which meant we got hassled by a number of other taxi drivers until we decided to just go to the bar and wait for them to come. A few minutes later I heard a young man asking other couples if they were me and then I flagged him down and he walked us over to the van. I mean for $60.00 I would think they would just put a sign but apparently, that wasn't the case. Then to add insult to injury when we arrived in Playa we got dropped off 3 three blocks away because they close down streets in this area at night. Well, I think I already knew that and if they had been a easier to work with I don't think that would have annoyed me as much as it did. Checking into the hotel was easy. They were waiting for us and had everything ready to go. We had a Deluxe Ocean View Room which was nice and the AC was excellent. Unfortunately, we had ants in our bathroom and I had to go down the next morning and ask them to please spray them or do something. They did but from time to time I still saw some ants wandering around the bathroom counter and that's just something you don't want to deal with on vacation. We had issues with them running out of towels for \" the day\" and that was different? But then I noticed as we walked in and out that others were having the same trouble with beach towels and even regular bath towels being available for guest. Day in and day out things were fine but what really bothered me was the fact that it took about 30 minutes to check out. We had finished packing and I headed down to the lobby at 11am to close everything out. The front desk lady was very nice and did nothing but apologize but apparently, the restaurant had misplaced or had done something incorrectly with our bills from our entire stay and they had to redo everything manually. They brought up every single receipt we had signed for and I had to go through them and tell them whether they were ours or not. Then she had to add everything manually and finally she was able to check us out. The whole thing was incredibly frustrating but finally it was over and we were on our way back to the airport. All in all - It was a nice experience at Playa Maya and there was definitely more good than bad. It was a good value for our money but I'm definitely going to consider a different boutique hotel the next time we end up spending some time in Playa Del Carmen.

We picked this hotel based on all the positive reviews posted at TripAdvisor and also based on its size and convenient location, right at the beach. The hotel certainly met our needs and more! It is a quiet, small, cozy, well maintained 3-story hotel with a lot of charm and great service provided by its staff. We booked one of the Deluxe Terrace rooms ($150/night) which we found very comfortable and inviting, specially the roomy terrace with the hammock. Upon arrival we were welcomed with couple of Corona beers and sodas stocked in our small refrigerator, nice touch indeed. The room was simple,unpretentious, very clean, decently furnished, with a plasma TV and DVD player, and a partial, nice view to the ocean. There is no radio/alarm clock in the rooms, so bring your own or ask for a wake-up call if you need it. The hotel provides free internet connection in an air-conditioned room, very nice. The only issue we found was that the keyboard was a Spanish keyboard but the PC was configured for English keyboard, so it was a little confusing to use... As many reviewers have mentioned, access to the hotel is from the beach, but the entrance is just about 15 ft. from 8th Street, only separated by Hotel La Alhambra which shares a wall with Playa Maya. Also, there is no elevator in the hotel. Please keep this in mind if you are considering this hotel and have a disability. When you book the room directly with the hotel, they send you detailed information with directions to the hotel and what to tell the taxi driver to get you close to the entrance. If you decide to take the ADO bus from the airport to the hotel ($8 one way) you will arrive at the bus terminal on 5th Avenue and Calle Juarez, which is about 4 blocks from the hotel. Great alternative specially if you are traveling light. The hotel restaurant faces the beach and has a nice Palapa just few feet from the water. We had our breakfast every morning with our feet in the sand, what a nice way to start the day! Breakfast was pretty decent, we had the option of continental or american breakfast. We also had lunch at the restaurant regularly, the food was really good and varied. The coconut shrimp, ceviche and the tacos are recommended!!! We also want to praise the waiting staff, everyone was super nice and friendly. No wonder we didin't want to go anywhere else for our meals! Being so close to the beach made it extremely convenient to walk from the beach to the room and back, it felt like being in our private house and having all the beach to ourselves! Speaking of the beach, the section right in front of the hotel is rocky, but about 40-50 ft to the left the beach is clean and beautiful. The hotel also offers massage right at the beach, in case you want to pamper yourself... Location-wise, this hotel is hard to beat!! We truly enjoyed the peace and quiet of the hotel at night, despite its proximity to 5th Avenue (5 Avenida) . It is about a 7 minute walk to the ferry terminal to go to Cozumel. If you walk along the beach heading north, you will find excellent beaches and very nice resorts, so go out and explore! For excursions, we took the one offered by Edventure Tours, HIGHLY recommended!. You can actually book the tour once you are in Playa del Carmen. Their telephone number is posted in TripAdvisor (do a search for the company name, look for Edventure Tour reviews), so no real need to book via e-mail in advance. We booked the trip the afternoon before, very easy. For dinner we tried to explore restaurants outside the main touristy area looking for the authentic food and ambiance, based on recommendations from the restaurant staff. There is, for example, a very nice cafe/restaurant (from Veracruz) on 8th Street in front of the City Hall (forgot the name, but very easy to spot). great coffee and food, super affordable and air conditioned! We also recommend the only Mayan restaurant in the area, on 8th Street close to 5th Avenue - don't miss out! Also check out Restaurant La Bahia on 4th Street and 10th Avenue, very authentic and great seafood!! For telephone calls, you have the option of using your own cell phone (Verizon in out case, $0.99/min), purchase a Ladatel calling card from one of the several money exchange booths, or go to one of the many call centers along 5ta. Avenida. Never attempted to place a call from the hotel lobby, so we have no idea about the fares. All in all, it was a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation, and felt very welcome by the locals and also the hotel staff. We made friends with some of the other guests who also stayed at the hotel, looks like everyone enjoyed their time at Playa very much!!

It was very affordable, very cute, clean and the staff really made us feel welcome and more than anything, at home. I think right off the bat that is the number one plus in my book. The staff was very accommodating, as we saw many of the same faces each day. Other pluses in my book were location (you can't beat beachfront), and a complementary breakfast each morning on that beach. For those who thought this was confusing, you just have to look closely at the menu to figure out what is included in the complementary breakfast. Other observations: - the hotel isn't really \"open\" in the evenings. they seemed to serve through to about 6pm and it was quiet in the evenings. so if you're looking for Dance Party Mexico, this isn't it. but really, with 5th Ave right behind the hotel you have a zillion bars and restaurants, you leave the hotel for the evening and when you come back exhausted, it's quiet ready for a good night's rest. -the standard rooms are nice and clean but the terrace is a wee small. it was just fine for two people but i would probably upgrade next time for a bigger terrace -if you are going to watch your favorite American TV shows, you should probably make sure your DVR at home works, this is not the place for couch potatoes - unless you speak Spanish -if you are looking for a huge swimming pool, this is also not the place - instead, take note of the wonderful beach and water about 20 steps away! -if you arrive after hours, make sure you notify the hotel staff ahead of time. because the \"entrance\" is on the beach, you feel like you are going around back of the hotel. it's a little odd for the first time visitor, and there is a very nice security guard waiting for you, just have a confirmation on hand and don't be alarmed that there are not a million lights flashing upon arrival. -little things we didn't notice until midway - like the showers to rinse off out by the outdoor restrooms or the little pool off water to wash your feet off after leaving the beach. nice touches -i agree with other reviewers, most of the beachfront hotels seemed small, charming and pleasant so i assume they are all comparable. however i thought Playa Maya did an excellent job, the food and drink were so good that even now that i'm back in Chicago, i find myself missing Playa Maya many a meal!", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly Simple, and At the Right Price\u201d", "Author": "TJinSTL", "ReviewID": "UR16340643", "Content": "My wife and I spent 4 nights at Playa Maya, May 16-20.

We had a car rental, which made it more difficult. 8th Street, where the hotel is located, is blocked off to cars down by the hotel. We were frantically looking for a place to park, so we could check in. We ended up parking in a yellow zone and once we walked and found the entrance, Pablo told us we could not park in the yellow zone and that there was a public parking garage nearby (which was much easier than trying to find a parking place)The policia did let my husband through to drop off our bags before he parked the car, and the garage was only a couple of blocks from the hotel. We lost one of our keys within the first couple of hours we were there and the hotel does have a $40.00 charge for lost keys..so be careful. There is a guard on duty in front of the hotel at night so we felt secure. I would also recommend having dinner at the Fusion restaurant just down the beach.

Our driver was helping us with our bags when the Playa Maya staff spotted us, ran over, grabbed our bags and took them the rest of the way for us. The short walk across the beach to access the hotel is not an inconvenience at all - in fact it adds to the secluded feeling. Check-in: Check-in was a breeze. We presented our confirmation email and passports and were on our way to the room in a matter of minutes. Accomodations: We were on the third floor, facing the ocean. The room was spacious, had a mini-fridge that got a fresh bottle of water put in daily. The king bed was as comfortable as any other bed we've had in Mexico. They tend to be on the firm side, but that's my preference. The air conditioner was plenty powerful for the size of the room - we were never too warm. The room had a flat panel TV, plenty of channels, though nothing we normally watch. The patio was small, but it did accommodate two chairs and a small table. We enjoyed sitting out on our patio, looking out at Cozumel, all the activity on the water and on the beach. There is a computer connected to the internet available for use in a common area by the pool. It was nice to be able to check email at no charge. There are also plenty of internet cafes around PdC. Later in the evenings, there was a security guard at the entrance which was nice. We took advantage of the free breakfast nearly every day. It was a good amount of food and enough variety that you didn't have to eat the same thing every day. The service in the Playa Maya restaurant was always friendly. Fast service is not the norm in Mexico, you just need to relax and adjust to local time. We also had lunch at Playa Maya a couple of days, both at our lounge chairs and at the seating area. The food was good and reasonable priced. The beach was great. The hotel has lounge chairs right in front, and the hotel provides beach towels.Umbrellas are also provided free of charge if you are staying at Playa Maya. Some days there see a fair amount of day trippers from cruise ships. We enjoyed conversing with people from the different cruise ships. The water was not super warm in November, but once we got in, we could stay in for long periods of time. The bottom was sandy and there were small fish swimming all around. Playa del Carmen has so many restaurants that you could stay there for weeks before having to eat at the same place twice. In eight days, we ate at many different restaurants - Mexican, Italian, and Argentinian. We enjoyed the majority of our meals. Fifth Avenue has not only a lot of restaurants, but all the shopping you could ever ask for. Probably too much. It is closed to vehicle traffic with the exception of a few of the cross streets. There is a WalMart, just a short walk up Calle 8, on the right as you are walking away from the beach. We did one side trip. We caught the collectivo in Play del Carmen and rode to the Tulum archealogical zone, toured the Tulum ruins, then found beach access and walked the beach heading south. We caught a taxi at a hotel into the town of Tulum where we had lunch at a street side restaurant. We had also planned on taking the ferry to Cozumel, but sand gravity got the better of us. We ran out of our own books to read, but there are many paperbacks available in the lobby and we borrowed a couple.

One thing we loved about the hotel is as soon as you went to the beach you had someone from the staff asking if you wanted a beach chair or umbrella.

It was hard to get in the water without looking like a complete idiot. I have seen alot of people complaining about having to walk through the beach to get th the hotel enterance. When we got there we couldn't figure out why everyone complained about this so much. You come off the main street and walk a total of maybe a minute through the beach. It really wouldn't be inconvenient to anyone except for a person who is handicapped. The breakfast every morning was pretty good. We never had any other meal there. Though the breakfast was good, we found the wait staff to be rather rude. This is probably because we only speak very poor spanish, and this didn't sit well with most of the Mexican people.

The room was clean, the bed comfortable, the shower large (with water pressure!), the air conditioning worked great, the toilet flushed (this is a problem in some hotels in Mexico), the rates were reasonable, the landscaping pretty and the view was fantastic. There were nice touches, such as big, thick towels, a small refrigerator in the room, and umbrellas to borrow if it was raining. We received an extra towel to use as a beach towel daily. The morning coffee was ready early and the breakfast (served at 8) was very good. This hotel had a real homey feel to it, which I'm not sure we would have gotten at a larger hotel. We got to know the friendly desk staff pretty well by the end of our week's stay. The hotel was a tranquil getaway, yet only a block from the busy 5th Avenue bars, shops, and restaurants.

Upon checking in, we received a big welcome back from Adriane who works in the restaurant. Jorge came to shake hands and Alberto had a nice to see you again smile for us. We had an early arrival, so our room wasn't ready yet. No problem - grabbed lunch and drinks on the beach and chatted with Jorge (he was our waiter most of the time) and Delmy. Aide came to tell us our room was ready a tad bit early.....great off to the room. As always the room was clean, spacious and all we needed. Frig stocked with water and a couple of beers and sodas. The air worked too well. :) The water pressure was much better this stay. Management has added an extra lock on the door which I'm not sure is needed but makes you feel more secure. The beds as comfortable as always. At 5:45am the coffee is on and the security guard always had a morning greeting for me. The sunrise is worth the trip by itself. :) The hotel starts to come alive around 7am. Roberto arrives to set up the restaurant (sometimes by 6:30am) and rake the beach, the pool is being cleaned and things are power washed. The wonderful smell of breakfast cooking starts to fill the air. A note about the pool: I have seen complaints on it not being clean. It was cleaned every morning that we were there. The pool is like 20 steps from the beach. You can expect sand in it!! I doubt there is any way it is avoidable unless one person it going to be vacuuming no stop. The flavor is back in the food!! Playa Maya has the BEST beef tacos by far! Yum...love them. The coconut shrimp are good and the chicken tacos are a must try. We had excellent service at the restaurant and beach. A note about service: take a moment to really acknowledge your waiter, try a little chatting. It will make your stay much nicer for you and them. I saw one person not even looking at the waiter while ordering and a few treated them like only the hired help. Those people are missing out on an added bonus of traveling that makes your vacation more memorable. We have some great vacation memories that came from chatting with the locals. Try it! We paid for the wireless internet for the convenience. However there is free internet access in the lounge. The wireless works well and is $5 a day........not bad.

I'll hit on four major points: 1) Location, location! You just can't beat staying right on the beach with only a quick one block walk to all the action on Fifth Avenue. As others have stated, the Playa Maya has beach only access. Within minutes a hotel worker appeared to heft our luggage over the sand and right to the check in desk. 2) Rooms. We stayed in a \"Superior Balcony\" room with a gorgeous view. The rooms were exceptionally clean with the kind of super-charged AC one needs during July in Mexico. Cable TV and a small fridge stocked with a few welcoming beers and resupplied with a fresh bottle of water daily. Everyday we returned from our adventures in town to freshly made beds, a clean shower, and new towel art. We joked a lot with Juan for having a few \"sleeping in\" days, and he was always in good humor about our night owl ways. 3) Service. As others have stated, the hotel staff is extremely accommodating and friendly. Many thanks to Ayde, Pablo, Juan, Raciel and others who made our stay so great. With a tip from Ayde, we discovered Cenote Azul, a gorgeous place to snorkel. The hotel has security at night, which is reassuring when you keep late hours. Steve, the owner, was not there the first few days of our stay, but you would not know it from the professionalism of his staff during his absence. We eventually got to meet him in person to tell him how much we were enjoying our stay. 4) Food. I expected \"continental breakfast\" to be toast and coffee, but was pleasantly surprised at the hearty free breakfast. Choices of scrambled eggs with bacon (and a side of yummy beans!), pancakes, and terrific fresh fruit. We ordered two different ones nearly every morning with enough to share. The hotel also has lunch and dinner under their beachfront palapa. I've posted a pic of their famous coconut shrimp, which lived up to other traveler's raves. After breakfast, a worker would set up our loungers and umbrellas and we spent most early afternoons soaking up the sun with brief trips to the restaurant for frozen drinks and snacks (get the guacamole!). All in all, a terrific stay. This was our first trip to Playa del Carmen and we are hooked! The Playa Maya is your best bet if you want an affordable, quiet, clean and friendly beachfront hotel.

Here is the deal: the rooms were big, clean, AC was great. There was a hamac on the patio but we couldn't use it since there were 2 chairs there as well that we couldn't remove. The location was good but a negative aspect: good because it's right on 5th street so very close to restaurants and stores. The negative aspect was that the street was blocked to cars so it was a pain to get close to the hotel and unload the luggage. The beach is very nice but lots of people and the water is rocky and not very clean. We tried to eat breakfast at the restaurant but we had to wait 15min until somebody came to give us the menu which didn't look appetizing so we left. If it had only been for the above items, i would still have thought that the hotel was good. But what really made it an unpleasant experience was the service. So i guess since the owner was out of town, the staff really slacked off. It started as soon as we arrived. I had to ask the receptionist twice to send somebody over to help us upload the luggage from the car. Then, at the beach, we asked if we could get a couple more sunbeds and umbrella. They just laughed at us and never came and not because they were busy doing something else. During the 3 days we stayed, we always saw 3-4 guys from the staff in the hamacs next to the restaurant (at one point we thought those hamacs were not for hotel guests) and 2-3 seated at the restaurant reading newspaper or chatting. It was just a hassle to ask them anything. Now, 1 more thing: i am surprise to read from other reviews that internet was free, since they charged us $5/day for internet. So it is free or not?

Although I'm sure Stephen Ryberg (owner) will provide a long response which may seem professional, I can assure you from my direct correspondence trying to address the matter - it's like speaking with a lawyer. It seems like he's listening, but it is only a cover to try and make it seem like he cares and absolve his responsibility. First let me say that I stayed only at Playa Maya Hotel and had no other travels offering the introduction of bedbugs to my belongings. I did experience bites while there, but had never encountered/knew anything of bedbugs prior so I did not recognize what was happening at the time and didn't know to check under the sheets/mattress. I believe it was a building problem as I had only a few bites as opposed to being covered as I have now read from other travelers' horror stories. Although, I almost wish I had been so I would have known immediately to leave and take great care with my luggage upon returning home as it would have prevented the nightmare of trying to get rid of them now. If you decide to stay - check your matresses or futons! I was hesitant to write this review at all but felt like I should at least warn people, hopefully they have all ready taken care of the problem - but if there are other people out there that have had the same experience, I encourage you to write because that was one of their claims of no problem - there haven't been internet postings. I relied a lot on the various reviews on this site and others, so I thought I ought to at least put the information out there. Playa Maya/Stephen Ryberg has denied all responsibility as if I imagined the problem and since I did not complain while there that there must not be a problem. Well, I guess if the room had been totally infested or I had known what bedbug bites looked like vs mosquitoes then I would have complained; maybe the current guests will find otherwise ( unless they have since sprayed/treated the room[s]). I agree with the other guest reviews as well that the restaurant staff is not friendly (but tipping well will help) and it did get old watching them try to lure walkers-by onto their part of the beach. The breakfast was good, but I don't recommend going early; I went down for early breakfast and they were still combing the beach and didn't offer any service even though it was all ready into the supposed serving time. Also had no coffee one morning - now that puts the brakes on breakfast you if you like your coffee in the a.m. like I do. I will say the non-restaurant staff were very friendly, my thanks to Ayde (sp?), Pablo and Angelina. Other things that were problematic: My room floor was flooded from the hot water heater when I arrived; they did give me access to another room to shower for the couple days it took to repair the problem in mine but offered no discount until my recent correspondence - I should have complained more while I was there evidently. The computer with internet access broke and was not repaired, for at least several days as I did not have access for 1/2 my stay. Some of the lights - by the jacuzzi and in my room did not work. There were tiny ants - and trust me, I kept everything that could have been attractive to them in the fridgerator (that froze everything). And the staff was aware of the flood, broken computer and broken/malfunctioning lights. Getting to the hotel is a pain due to the sand-only entrance, especially of you're traveling a lone. You have to lug your luggage across another hotel's (Alhambra) beach/dining area and then someone from PM will probably see you and help. It's not as if you can leave your luggage on the street and walk over and notify them for help. The location overall is pretty good. It's nice to be right on the beach, although it does get crowded and there are a lot of boats that dock/load-up during the day right near by and you do get the fumes. The water was merky - really no snorkeling or such right on the PM beach as it's overworked/busy with little ocean life. It's nice and quiet at night, never had a problem with noise as there are no loud clubs near by. Nice walking distance to the main drag and tons of restaurants - although I was surprised by how \"americanized\" the places and prices seem to be compared to many other places in Mexico. It's sad to me to provide such a poor review and to have to deal with such a gross problem as a result of trying to take a vacation. It was terrible since I've had the bedbug experience - it would have been all right if I hadn't. I had several friends staying in other locations around Playa del Carmen at the same time - I recommend looking elsewhere given the bedbugs and the owner's attitude when customers have had problems. Probably be a good stay thanks to the staff if you don't have any trouble - but if you do have a problem - as others have written, don't expect the owner to sincerely help.

Obviously, she had the key. When I arrived at the hotel, the gate was locked and the guard asked to see my key. I explained that we only had one key and that my sister had it. He said that he was sorry, but that without a key, he could not let me in. I was able to explain my situation, and understand his explanation in Spanish, so this was not an issue of language confusion. I started to get upset as this situation continued. He eventually let me in, but seemed very reluctant to do so. I am not sure what I would have done, had he refused to let me in. The next day we requested and received a second key. However, the man at the front desk said that second keys are not always available. I can certainly appreciate the security that is provided by a locked gate and a guard. However, I feel that Playa Maya should provide guests with a way to prove that they are legitimate guests, especially if they can't provide all the guests with a key.

This is our 3rd stay in PDC in as many years. This was our first stay at Playa Maya. We booked just about 2 months out, so we were only able to get the Deluxe Jacuzzi Garden Room. Our room had one king bed, a futon sofa, a flat-screen TV, a DVD-Player, a mini-refrigerator and a private patio with a Jacuzzi. The room was a very nice size, everything in perfect working order. A large walk-in shower (no tub) with good water pressure. As all beds tend to be in Mexico, ours was quite hard. Our housekeeper cleaned our room every day and did a very fine job! Our room was just fine, but I would much prefer an Ocean View on future trips. The location of Playa Maya is awesome. Right on the beach, right in the middle of town, just a short walk to anywhere. The beach-only access is just that\u2026you must walk on the beach to get to the entrance. It is one of several things that make this hotel unique. The staff is what really makes this hotel shine. They WILL assist you with your luggage across the sand when you arrive (if you notify them that you\u2019ve arrived, as they wouldn\u2019t know otherwise). I asked Pablo (the afternoon Front Desk) for two extra pillows on my second day. He didn\u2019t have them, but promised to try to get me them the following day\u2026and he did! Joaquin always provided excellent service during breakfast and also drink service on the beach during the day. And finally, our housekeeper did a great job every day. Although I never saw him/her, or know their name, they did a wonderful job of cleaning our room everyday. He got every piece of sand swept up off the floor every day! The hotel has a computer with Internet available for guest use, free of charge. I used it the morning of my departure to check on my flight status. Wireless Internet is also available, for $5.00 per day charge. The beach at Playa Maya is very nice. They will get your beach chairs set up for you each morning, along with an umbrella and a little side table. The beach itself is very nice. The water this time of year was a little chilly for me, but it was still very comfortable to swim in, once I got used to the temperature. The only thing I would mention about Playa Maya is that it is certainly a quiet hotel in the evening. By 8PM or 9PM, the bar and restaurant are closed and there is no one around. You have to walk up into town to get something to eat or drink later in the evening.

We stayed for one week in April and it was a second visit after a few years. The experience was just as invariably great; the management and the staff is friendly and accomodating (they almost give you the feeling of home), the rooms are spacious and very clean. If you want a no-stress hotel experience, this is the choice - I even decided to put away the vacation for a few weeks, when the hotel was booked, rather than take a chance with other places. (I list a few restaurant choices below; I think it was a great idea by another guest) Playa Maya was the best combination for us- -reception is exceptionally hospitable, little things we may have found inconvenient (not even worth mentioning!) would be arranged promptly. -we enjoyed great views from the balcony and slept to the sound of the Caribbean sea. it is fairly off the buzz of the town. the room and shower were spacious and comfortable. -location is truly great; the hotel is still one of the few that are directly on the beach, you are one block from the 5th avenue, minutes from the dive shop (we tried Geofish and had a great experience), a beach walk to the Cozumel ferry. -we had the great service and convenience of an \"all inclusive\" access to everything we wanted without the nuisance of the all-inclusive package (if you don't want to move at all during your stay, the excellent restaurant and bar of Playa Maya will provide you with everything- there were a few guests that did just that for one week; but if you want to have a freedom of a larger choice - again you are one block from the main avenue where all the happening goes and for us it was a great option) -the rate includes breakfast, which you enjoy at the beach restaurant and it is a very nice experience (the coffee from the coffee pot in the hotel is better than the one in the restaurant - as we and few guests concurred). the service is somewhat slow in the restaurant so it is a bit hard to get it over with if you have an early morning trip arranged. we discovered that one had to go an extra step (or an extra tip) to get the restaurant staff to be slightly more welcoming and efficient. Of course anyone will find easily things to do/places to eat around Playa del Carmen, but we were looking for a comforting food and a general rule was to avoid places with flyers and posters advertising the beer or other special offers. This is a sure bet to get the quality meal. However, a few recommendations on 5th avenue - La Caprichoza - offers excellent typical Mexican food (from Guadalajara) - Ula Gula and Tierra Maya (?the last word escapes my memory) - these two offer a high end Mexican food -Deseo lounge- take a few steps up to the lounge where you can enjoy a refreshing breeze, watch a Mexican movie from the 20s and have a drink lying on the \"bed\" off 5th Avenue -Blue parrot beach club- if you want to see more of the fellow tourists and dance on the platform on the beach (but on that street you can find some of the fanciest restaurants as well - an Asian -fusion place I can not remember the name of just opposite the Blue parrot is very good) off-off 5th Avenue -El Fogon (it is a just an experience because this is what the locals eat you will probably be the only tourist there to enjoy an excellent food)- ask around or at the reception.

The hotel is very clean, the staff was helpful and friendly, and the location is amazing. We also found the Playa Maya (and Playa del Carmen) to be fairly priced. Perhaps it's due to the exchange rate, but we felt the prices for food and drinks were less than what we had expected ($2 Dos Equis delivered to you on the beach). This was a pleasant surprise! No $5 bottles of water here. . . (Perhaps because they don't get many business travelers, as I only delve into the hotel mini-bars when I'm on the company dime. . . . ) ANYWAY, we really enjoyed our experience in Playa del Carmen and Playa Maya. As previously mentioned, the location of Playa Maya is fantastic - short walking distance to numerous restaurants, bars, shopping, and the hotel is literally on the beach. Sometimes hotels overstate their beach location in pictures, but not here. Playa Maya does a great job with the basics in hotel accomodations - it's clean, the service is prompt and friendly, and the food was good. I would highly, highly recommend the Playa Maya to anyone looking for a nice, clean, relaxing hotel in a great location with excellent service. What else do you need, really? I rated this review 'excellent' because the Playa Maya exceeded our expectations, and I couldn't think of anything negative. This is not to say that 5 dots means 5 stars - this is not the Ritz-Carlton-by-the-sea, but neither is the price. 5 dots means that for the prices we paid we were very impressed. I fully expect that we will return to the Playa Maya in the future. Tangent unrelated to the hotel: I couldn't find good reviews on restaurants around PDC, but we had good food pretty much every night. Here's a run down (we ate every meal outside for an entire week, 3 meals a day. Think about that for a moment): - Yaxche (Mayan/Mexican): Eat here at least once. Excellent, thought about going back again, and really close to the hotel. - Media Luna (Mayan/Mexican): Again, excellent. Highly recommended - La Palapa Hemingway (Mexican): Very good, but a notch below the above - Rolandi's: Italian chain in the mall at the ferry pier - Olive Garden in Mexico. That is not a compliment. I'm sure there is much, much better in the area especially north of Constitueyentes (I butchered that word, I know), so try one of those and let me know what I missed. - La Quinta Pasion (Mexican): Again, fantastic and a little cheaper than the top two. Also in a different area of town that we wouldn't have seen. - Breakfast and Lunch every day on the beach at Playa Maya.

The pool is small by resort standards but we enjoyed it all the same. Portions of it are shaded in the late afternoon and are a nice break from the sun and sand. The rooms we stayed in were very sparse and certainly not what I would call comfortable for anything other than sleeping.

If you are looking for a clean place to lay your head, take a shower and have some beach time - it works well.

This is an wonderful little hotel, but please do not mistake a rating of \"5\" (which means excellent on this site) as the same thing as a 5 star USA hotel such as the Hyatt or The Four Seasons. I gave the Playa Maya a rating of a \"5\" because of location/price/friendliness/cleanliness and local ambience. The location of Playa Maya is superb. My husband and I are light sleepers and due to the way this hotel is cradled on 3 sides by other establishments (the hotel is basically a big \"U\" with the opening of the \"U\" facing the ocean) there is virtually no night time noise, except the ocean! The only night out of 6 that we had trouble with noise was one evening when an obviously VERY drunk young couple arrived back @ the hotel at almost 4:00 in the morning and proceeded to yack on their veranda! But that was not the hotel's fault. This little gem of a hotel is clean, the bathrooms are spotless, the bedding is clean and fresh, and the beds themselves are fairly comfortable as these are firm but not rock hard, (I have heard that the standard hotel bedding in Mexico is VERY firm). All 4 of the hotel's front desk staff are very friendly and more than happy to help you with directions and recommendations. We were always greeted with a smile and warm greeting as we passed the front desk. Playa Maya is only 1 block back from \"Avenue 5\" - the main shopping/dining street in Playa. You can easily get around without need for a car here, and, if you are interested, just ask the front desk personnel and they will give you information on where and how to catch a \"collectivo\" to Tulum or other places of interest. You can catch a ride anywhere the collectivo (it is a local, little white van - public transportation) runs for the equivalent of $3.00 US for a one way trip. As I stated earlier, this is a nice, warm, friendly, clean little establishment right on a nice stretch of beach in Playa. It \"feels\" tropical and Mexican, and the decor is quite pretty and cheerful. But do not expect the services and amenities of a 4 or 5 star mainland USA hotel. The pool is smallish and not heated in winter (as far as I could tell). The hot-tub was never above approx. 96-97F by a toe-touch test that I performed 3 times just to check (I have my own hot-tub so I am pretty good at guestimating the temp.) And, if you have any physical handicaps access to the hotel involves walking across sand approx. 25-30 ft., then up a small staircase (7 or 8 steps?) across a small arched bridge that goes over the pool (incline up and then sloped down), then up about 8-10 steps again to the lobby. Very pretty and picturesque, but possibly a hazard to the elderly or anyone with an unsteady gait; definitely NOT for anyone using a walker or possibly even a cane. If you take the transportation company recommended by the manager Steve ([---]), the taxi driver will take your bags all the way up to the front desk, so that is no problem, and upon checkout there is help to take your bags back to the taxi/van.

I did a lot of research here and on another Playa message board about the AI's and hotels in Playa del Carmen since none of us had ever been to Mexico before. Not really interested in going the AI route or booking a more expensive luxury hotel, I looked for a smaller beachfront hotel that was reasonably priced and found it perfectly in the Playa Maya Hotel. Actually it exceeded my expectations. The location is great, just a block away from 5th avenue and all the happenings there. When arriving, you have to walk from the street a short distance through sand to get to the hotel. It was not a big deal since a couple of guys from the hotel came and took our bags for us. I thought the hotel was very well-kept and clean. The rooms were plain but quite roomy and very clean. They were even mopped every day we were there. The shower was nice and big and none of us ever had a problem with hot water. There was a small refrigerator in the room that got ice-cold which was nice. I thought it was a nice touch that the refrigerator also came with a big bottle of water and a few other refreshements complimentary. You can't drink the water at the hotel but we pretty much expected that in Mexico. Ice is provided at the bar, just make sure you get down there before closing. The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch daily with a continental breakfast included in the room rate. For breakfast you can actually get more than a simple continental, hotcakes and eggs are available as well. I think there are four continental breakfast choices that are listed on the right side of the menu, just verify with the server as we did. Lunch at Playa Maya is awesome, I think our group ate lunch there every day of our stay. That would probably be overkill for some, but we really enjoyed the lunch menu there. As has probably been said before, the coconut shrimp are indeed awesome, and I also really loved the guanjillo shrimp. Other things we really liked... their guacamole, shrimp tacos, and nachos. There's also a beer bucket (5) w/ nachos for around $12.00 that was available as a special. You can eat under the restaurant palapa or eat at your lounge chair on the beach, great either way. I thought the beach was great in front of the hotel and it was where we spent most of our time. Chairs and towels are provided and servers are always available to bring you whatever you wish for. The service was great and after a couple of days we developed a rapport with two servers who took great care of us. The hotel staff overall was friendly, although there was a language barrier with some people since we don't speak Spanish at all. Regardless, we were almost always greeted with an \"hola\" by everyone. I think the beach was the best part of our vacation. Which was obviously why it was important to us to find a beachfront hotel. The beach in front of the hotel was actually bigger than I expected and the water was lovely. And as I said chairs, towels and service is provided by the hotel. It was great! There is a pool at the hotel, but none of us care about pools so we spent no time there. I did see it being cleaned every morning I was there. Overall, we all really loved the Playa Maya for what it offers.

Guess Steve & co must have put one in for that family and then took it back out again, huh?!? We stood in what they told us USED to be a gym before the hurricanes, a nice little room with AC, sofa and chairs, and (most importantly for us) a PC with free Internet access. That was great for staying in touch with things back home on both stays. For us the staff at reception (Pedro, Anna and Maitay) were all very helpful, especially with restaurant recommendations and special requests (wife always wants extra pillows). We were served mostly by Joaquin at the beach, also excellent. They set out the beach chairs for us every morning. Breakfast was clear: an announcement right on the menu tells you that you get any of their breakfast combinations free. I stuck with those and they were plenty but my wife was happy to order eggs benedict and pay extra. Reception staff also reminded us about the included breakfast when they showed us to the room (maybe people aren't listening to everything then?). We had a jacuzzi room with a garden and liked the additional space. Figure you're on the beach every day so don't need the ocean view. Lots of channels in English, too. We did have a problem with hot water being out one day, but just reported it to the desk and waited until after breakfast to shower, and it was fine. My advice is to remember that there are a lot of crazies out there, and it looks like some of them have found Trip advisor, judging by some of those comments. We loved Playa Maya and will return for a 3rd stay when we can!", "Date": "October 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, but not great\u201d", "Author": "TexasYank", "ReviewID": "UR5956131", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Playa Maya in early May of 2006 for three nights. It was our first stay in Playa del Carmen, but we have stayed on the Mayan Riviera in AIs many times. We were anxiously anticipating our stay here, since it sounded so very nice and friendly from the reviews and the website. Overall, we had a good time, and enjoyed our stay, primarily because of the location. Just a block off 5th Avenue, and on the beach...the location couldn't have been better for us. Our oceanview room was clean and adequate. Upon arrival, two bottles of water were in the fridge and could be refilled at the bar as often as you liked. There was also beer and pop in the fridge. A suggestion for improvement would be to put an inexpensive clock in the room, and a small coffee maker. Maybe this isn't the norm for PDC, I don't know. On our last night, we moved to a garden room, which was a delight for me. The room was fine - adequate size and very clean. It had a beautiful little courtyard, sheltered by plants and a palapa-type cover over the outdoor jacuzzi tub. Completely private. There was also a small table and chairs out there. If we were to stay at Playa Maya again, this would be the room I would want. No oceanview - or any view for that matter - but it was very charming and intimate. The food at the restaurant was good. The breakfast was very good, and sitting out on the beach under the palapa with the ocean breeze coming in, made it very enjoyable. We had hamburgers one afternoon, and they were delicious! Some people have complained about the restaurant closing so early. 5th Ave. is only a block away, and there is such a huge variety of restaurants, etc. there, it isn't inconvenient at all not to have the hotel restaurant open later. My only negative comment would be about the friendliness of the help. We'd read so much about how accommodating and friendly everyone there was, and we really didn't find that at all. Other than Pedro, at the front desk when we checked in, and the girl who was at the desk when we checked out, everyone else was very cold. We were pretty much ignored most of the time, until we left the beach the first day, and were chased down by one of the waiters in the restaurant. He said we owed them money from breakfast. (I had no idea he would have ever recognized us, let alone watch us to make sure we didn't walk out on the ticket!) Guests get a free continental breakfast. The waiter gave us menus and didn\u2019t say anything about what we could or couldn\u2019t have, but did ask us for our room number (so knew we were guests). Turned out, they charged me for my breakfast because it wasn\u2019t continental, but didn\u2019t charge my husband (his wasn\u2019t either). When he handed me a menu and didn't say anything else, I wrongly assumed I could choose anything from it. The next day, after being chased down to pay the ticket the first day, I read the menu more closely, and realized that there are only certain items on the menu that are included in the continental breakfast. My mistake, but I don't think it was handled very well. We heard on the beach from other guests that the owner, Steven, was out of the country, and so, we assumed that maybe because he wasn't there, the help was kicking back. We probably wouldn't have even thought anything about it, except for all the raving reviews about the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Anyway, all that said, we had a pleasant stay, except for the lack of friendliness. And, despite those negative comments, we would stay there again, primarily because of it's location...close to 5th Ave. and right on the beach.", "Date": "October 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cQuestions who is writing all the good reviews!?!\u201d", "Author": "tonyrusa9", "ReviewID": "UR5906616", "Content": "We have used TripAdvisor without much question for the last few years. However, having found the many positive - and in fact - overwhelmingly good reviews- posted on this site, we have now come to question the validity based on our recent visit to Playa Maya. My guess is that either the hundreds that are posting here have experienced subpar visits at hotels in Mexico, thus making the Playa Maya appear as great, or that all the posts are not hotel guests. It would also appear, based on the frequency of reports back on this hotel, that the guests of this hotel are very 'internet affluent' as there are soooo many posts. We stayed for a short trip where a number of things went wrong. We had a party of 5 staying in one of the \"ocean view' rooms with the expectatiion, based on the price, of a room that contained an actual ocean view. Our room consisted of a slice of the ocean, that where you could definately see water, was by no means on ocean view. I guess we should have done more research, as the photos on the website lead you to believe that there is much more to see than once you arrive. We also found the hotel staff to be near inexistent. In one event, while trying to request a taxi from the front desk (which is little more than a table in an entryway), we waited over 10 minutes for someone to arrive. When asking why it took so long, we were informed that they were short staffed due to it being 'off season'. Leaving feeling a disappointed we went outside and found a cab on our own, probably paying 2x as much as our friends from down the street to get to our destination. While this may seem small, these items began to add up over the week. We were told there would be a water cooler in the gym - this was empty when we arrived. The rooms were ok, and the air conditioning worked fine, but our family spends very little time here. The food was ok, but definately not somewhere you would eat other than to get a snack. Drinks, very bad. Had a margarita that looked to have been sitting on the bar all day and a beer the same. Needless to say, we left and only returned to sleep. With all this, we spoke with a person who claimed to be the manager named 'Steve or Shaun or something like that' and while apoligizing also managed to tell us that we should not expect a 'cold' drink in Mexico due to the humidity and that while the water cooler was a convenience, was really just sometihng that was provided when available. All in all, I felt like we were getting the same treatment as you would getting called into a hotel by one of the street vendors. We were already there, had already paid, and that was the way it went -- it was Mexico. Very disappointing and would recommend looking beyond the reviews a little further. Not to mention, in hindsight, looking back at any bad review, the manager always comes back with some sort of reason why the customer WAS WRONG. Perhaps I'm spoiled in the US, but from my experiece, the customer IS RIGHT regardless of the shortcomings of the hotel or staff. Playa is a fantastic place to visit just do your research before you go and make the most of your trip. I've placed other great reviews for some of the fabulous restarounts we went to, as well as some fun things to do while there.

This is a relatively new hotel. The place is pretty small (I think that's a good thing), I estimate that it is about 75' wide and sandwiched in between the Alhambra and another place who's name I didn't catch. We stayed in a \"Jr. Suite\" which is a room with a sort of kitchenette on the ground floor right next to the pool. They have a palapa \"shed\" roof that extends out from the front of the hotel with tables and chairs, its a very pleasant spot to hang out especially in the latter half of the day when the sun is shaded by the building. They have nice beach chairs with umbrellas which they set out front for you to enjoy the paradise. There is an airconditioned room off to one side which contains a PC with internet access for guests to use, this was handy for checking email etc. We met some nice people while lounging out at the beach and everyone was friendly and having a good time. The margueritas were good and cost 25 pesos each. They made decent food (expect to pay US prices though) and we did not get sick during our stay. The hotel manager is American, this is important because the Mexicans seem to have little attention to detail and without supervision they will let things slide. We thought the room was okay but with a few flaws. The plumbing worked well (unusual for PDC). The A/C was plenty cool and not noisy. The TV was a good one and got a lot of cable channels. It was nice to be able to walk only a few feet to the pool or the beach. Everything was clean. However the bed was small for two (full-size I think, not queen). The \"kitchen\" had a sink and two hotplates, you won't really be cooking any meals there. It was hard to keep from tracking sand into the room as there wasn't a door mat and no convenient place to rinse your feet. Our room had almost zero view out the windows but the upstairs rooms had a view of the beach. The bar/restaurant closes down at 6PM, that's pretty early for people on vacation. They pull in all the chairs, you don't even have a place to sit out in front. There's no ice machine, you can get some ice from the bar but you better do it before it closes in the evening. As other people have mentioned, there is no access to this hotel from the street (in fact you can't even see it). You have to haul your luggage across the sand as you come and go.

It was less like a hotel and more like having your own place right on the beach but with the amenities of a hotel, housekeeping, restaurant, service, etc. Never had shoes on at hotel, no need to, it was the most relaxing and easiet vavaction we have ever had and we have travelled extensively. The hotel was comfortable and convenient, walked right out your romm, through small reception area, over bridge and you were on beach where you could take your breakfast and lunch under a large palapa while digging your toes in sand, heaven.

Rico was most polite and attentive to us, also Mayti and other girl at reception, sorry did not get name, gave great customer service.

Had dinner one night at El Fogon, place where the locals go, great food and very cheap, at corner of norte 6 and 30th, two story open air restaurant, only a few blocks from hotel.

You have to walk around the front of another hotel at the end of calle 8 on the public beach for about 20 meters to get there, as the entrance is only beachfront. This got us in the mood right away to chill out with a drink even before we checked in. The room was basic but clean and had cute towel art on the bed. A lockbox was included at no extra charge which gave me a place to put my cameras and some valuables. There were some ants in the bathroom, but seeing as how we didn't bring much along and spent little time in there it wasn't a big deal. We kept the louvered window in the shower closed and that seemed to discourage them. Those hanging out on adjacent patios can hear what's going on in the shower so make sure you close the louvers if you're gonna make some noise ;) :P !! We found the coffeepot in the lobby handy for a first cup to sip back up on the room patio in the am since we're the type that like to catch the ocean view sunrise. The hotel's location is a short distance from places on or near avenida 5ta for some great breakfast at places like \"java joe's\", \"xlapak\" or \"hot!\". We only used the free hotel breakfast once since it took awhile to get the food. It was just handy to grab a quick free glass or 2 of fresh squeezed juice on the way out for the day. The maids cleaned the room up quite well around noon and it never had a musty nor a moldy smell. They would move suitcases around to make sure they cleaned up the floor really well so make sure you close those up to make it easier on them. They moved our shoes around too so we learned not to panic if they all ended up in the closet. They never took anything setting around the room, only the tips we left on the bed. We felt they wouldn't have bothered anything anyhow even if we'd forgotten to lock the safe. There's a small fridge with a couple of free complimentary beers, sodas & chocolates in it on arrival which is a nice touch for a small hotel such as this. It kept the food we brought from the store or restaurant leftovers cool enough to snack on. We discovered a metal fixture screwed into the bathroom wall near the tp which was handy for opening beer bottles. The a/c was cool enough for us and just dripped a little, but on the floor, not on the bed. It wasn't very noisy so we could still hear the waves on the beach as we fell asleep, which we found really relaxing. The beds aren't too hard, just firm enough to be good on the back. One day we hung out at the beach in front of this hotel all day & had some tasty blue house drink, some delicious coconut shrimp, margaritas, ceviche and kabobs. The food was great, not too spicy and reasonably priced. Don't feed the seagulls leftover chips upwind of those hangin around the shore though - they won't appreciate that! Hotel guests get free beach towels and first dibs on the hotel's beach loungers and use of the cover pads. When some folks walking down the beach tried to take someone's loungers while the guests went for a walk the guy taking care of the chairs ran them off. Make sure you tip these guys since they work hard making sure you've got food, drinks & an umbrella if you need it. The ocean in front of playa maya isn't real deep till you get out 100 meters or so and was fun to swim in or wave jump when the ferry down the shore came in & stirred up some 1 meter waves. The shore wasn't rocky but I watched out for the dive boats that dock right next to playa maya's beach. If these get to stinkin up things while coming or going I could walk about 50 meters to the left of their docking area & get in the ocean on a really nice spot. One boat actually unloaded someone right in front of playa maya then got whistled & gestured to by the life saver guys, which go up & down the beach all day. There isn't much good snorkeling right in front of the hotel but there's some guys who'll take you out on a small catamaran right near the lighthouse. This hotel's location is handy for getting to the bars & restaurants on avenida 5ta and beyond. The lack of direct street access at the hotel means we could leave behind all the nightly party racket when returning, since the entrance faces the ocean. The place has a handy, bright beachront sign that's visible from the ferry pier all the way to the ugly pier at constituyentes so if a night of partying at the beach bars leaves you staggering near the shore, just look for the sign to find home away from home.

It was a busy time of year, being spring break but I personally did not like the Playa Maya hotel all that much. Not because it was sold out crowded or anything like that. The pool is very small and in an odd location under a walking bridge that takes you into the hotel. Felt awkward sun bathing there as its small size pretty much made me feel like a storefront manequin on display. Too many google eyes. Other hotels I have visited there were many more using the pool and you never felt odd. But this pool is simply tiny in comparrison. The rooms vary a lot in location and view. I found the rooms fairly typical of this level of hotel. Clean. Nothing special, not bad. It is also difficult to get into the hotel itself as you have to walk across sand and it has a very unusual point of entry in comparrison to other hotels. Not a problem when you're just carrying a book and a towel but inconvinient unless you summon help. Just different. Would I stay here again? Probably not. It wasn't that bad, just not that good. The manager is an American which was neither here nor there. I never complained about anything and had minimal contact with him or any other rep of the hotel. Nothing I had issues with were of the type that could be remedied and I I wasn't there to visit with them. I'm just posting what I think about the place in general as far as overall convinience, the pool location and size and overall impressions. I would have rather stayed where the pool is more user friendly and the hotel design more conventional considering the infrequency I get to go to the area. If pools are not important as an option for you, you may be just fine with the place. I just like a good pool to escape to as an option to the beach.", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "US", "Title": "\u201cPlaya Maya - the good and the bad\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4990384", "Content": "The good news - excellent location both for beach and 5th, great local staff.

We selected this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and I have to wonder who posts them! The family suite (two adjoining rooms) was not available at time of booking last fall so, at the manager's recommendation, we booked a 'junior suite'. The 'sofa bed' was two child sized mattresses joined together in an alcove - it was no more than 5'6\" long, too short for comfortable sleeping for anyone in the family. The windows opened directly onto the supporting beams of the hotel's elevated sundeck. Overall, it was uncomfortable and dark. If I had known about this, I would have booked elsewhere and gladly paid more $$ for better accomodations. We asked for another room but none were available. I mentioned my concerns to the desk clerks on days 1 and 2 because I wanted to be sure that the manager heard about it. On day 3, the desk clerk called us and said that the manager was aware of our concerns and wanted us to tell him what he could do to make it up to us. I did not ask for a refund but asked him to update the website to better describe this 'junior suite' so that future guests would know what to expect. Other comments - there are exposed boulders/rock shelves on the beach in front of Playa Maya, especially at low tide. This is the case, though, at beaches up and down the strip and it doesn't prevent a pleasant swim. The room was clean. There was a good selection at breakfast (included in room rate).

There was enough wardrobe space, a safe, a fridge with a couple of free drinks, and cable TV. Great location, really handy for the main strip but quiet too. The maid made the most fantastic sculptures with the towels, a new one every day \u2013 the first day we had a bride and groom swan kissing.

Due to our 10 nite stay management informed us that we would have to stay 4 nites in a standard room and 6 nites in an ocean view terrace room. Our friends would stay 5 nites in a jacuzzi room and 5 nites in an ocean view balcony room. We agreed that this would be acceptable. The rooms and corresponding views were exactly as depicted on their website. So I knew exactly what I was getting and wasn't disappointed. Our flight from Minneapolis on Sun Country was perfect as were our transfers through Cancun Valet. We arrived around 11 a.m. to the Playa Maya and I immediately went to the front desk and told them of our arrival. An enthusiastic group of men from the hotel came over to Calle 8 and carried our bags to the hotel for us. The 25 steps from Calle 8 to the Playa Maya entrance were not an issue. Due to our early arrival, I didn't expect our room to be ready. It wasn't. However the people occupying our first floor standard room had checked out and Steve (and Delmy) allowed us to change in the room, leave our bags there and put our valuables in the safety deposit box which was greatly appreciated. The beach was perfect and wider than I had anticipated. Absolutely NO ROCKS and NO SEAWEED. Absolutely the best beach from the ferry pier to the Porto Real. Standard room was of adequate size with 2 double beds. Okay but not as comfortable as the king we had in our terrace room. Bathrooms in both were average size with a good sized shower. An improvement that could be made in the standard room would be to add a chest of drawers as there was not an abundance of storage in that room. Balcony in standard was extremely small but I knew that. Terrace was nice sized and gave an obstructed view of ocean of which I had been told of and was exactly as shown on hotel website. All in all I thought the rooms were pretty nice with good AC, nice TV, mini-fridge, deposit box. Very satisfactory and exceptionally cleaned everyday by our maid who we tipped $3 per day and usually made us towel art. Continental Breakfast everyday but usually upgraded to a breakfast of eggs, bacon, and potatoes in addition to the included Coffee, juice, and toast for 20 pesos more. Bucket of 5 Sol bottles on ice with a large nacho plate covered with beans and cheese for 110 pesos was a great deal. Large Pina Colada for 50 pesos was also great. Shrimp Tacos for 65 pesos were also excellent as were the Coconut Shrimp for 145 pesos (wish they had a coconut sauce on them though). Our usual waiter Jorge gave us great service and enjoyed joking with us. Feliciano was always ready and willing to set up the padded chairs and umbrellas for us each day. The Front Desk was where we would get our Beach towels which were very large, thick and of good quality. Internet was available next to the desk where I could check on the markets (I sold out at a profit Pablo!!). Front desk help of Anna, Myeti (sp), and Pablo were always friendly and fun to talk with. Especially enjoyed visiting with Pablo. We checked out early on the 23rd and there wasn't a lot of help around to carry our bags. Pablo eagerly and willingly grabbed two very large bags while Feliciano carried the other two large bags of our party. And then Pablo wouldn't even take an additional tip. That is the kind of help this hotel has. You actually feel like you are a welcome part of a family which I suppose is why they use the slogan \"Your Beachfront HOME\". We certainly enjoyed ourselves. The price paid for our rooms was in line for what we received. We got a nice room, great staff, in a great location, on a fantastic beach. An absolutely wonderful vacation. I expected a Great Stay and Got It. Thanks Playa Maya. I will definitely return someday, maybe not next year as my son is going to college. But I will return.

Yes, Hotel Playa Maya is beach-access only, and we consider this a terrific feature. The staff are quick to respond when you arrive and our luggage has always appeared in the lobby while we made our arrival know to Reception. I can't describe how excited we were peeling off the sandals on Calle 8 for the walk to the entrance. You're on vacation! Take your shoes off, relax and enjoy that warm sand between your toes! Everything was ready for our arrival and the front desk staff went to great efforts to have our room prepared and get us into it as quickly as possible. Where else would the reception person walk down to the beach with your keys and find you under the Palapa sipping a cold beverage and tell you your bags were already in your room? And that was before 1:30 p.m. You begin to feel the 'personal service' at Hotel Playa Maya almost immediately! The room was spacious and sported a mini-fridge so powerful it could freeze my cans of beer overnight! Be careful with that! Housekeeping was prompt and efficient every day. This is the cleanest hotel you will ever stay in. There were no odors other than cleaning supplies in our room. The bathroom is basic, but top-quality by Caribbean standards. This is our 10th Caribbean vacation so we have sampled a few bathrooms in our time. The plumbing works and the shower is excellent! What more do you need? Learn how to manage your per-room hot water supply and you will love it. The pool is definitely 'wading' more than 'swimming', but that should be obvious to anyone who reviews the pictures on the web site. The pictures show the pool from several perspectives, including various other features which help to gauge size, so we weren't surprised at all. The sundeck above the pool proved to be a popular hangout for the 'morning coffee' crowd during our stay as the rising sun quickly warms the area. And it was also popular towards later afternoon as it became a shady spot to cool down. The beach was positively huge during our stay. Hurricane Wilma clearly moved a lot of sand around and a very generous amount of it is now in front of Hotel Playa Maya. This year we had space for 4 rows of chairs, where last year it was 2 or 3 rows most days. And not a single rock in sight. We sampled the restaurant on several occasions and found the food to be excellent! Try the Burgers, Shrimp Tacos, Coconut Shrimp and Chicken Brochette! Last, but not least, everything that makes Hotel Playa Maya great in terms of location, facilities and amenities, would be nothing without the staff!

Here goes. My new wife and I celebrated our engagement in 2004 with a trip to Playa del Carmen. After some conversations with managers Steve and Delmy, we decided to return in 2005 and have our wedding there as well. With our limited budget and short guest list (my wife is Japanese and many of her friends and family could not jump the pond), we really could not afford a wedding planner or a whole lot of bells and whistles. Steve and Delmy offered to help us as much as they could (within reason, of course). Through the year Steve kept in contact with me and even put up with quite a few changes in schedule (two guests dropped out due to pregnancy. who said that planning a year and a half in advance was good?). He and his wife spoke to mariachis and fire dancers (who I've heard have since set fire to a nearby hotel and are now banned from performing on Mexican beaches. We were lucky on several levels!) to perform, both for very reasonable rates. When hurricane Wilma hit, I was able to monitor the hotel's cleanup on their website and Steve dropped me a line or two telling me the hotel would certainly be up and running by our wedding date, as well as reports as to how the rest of Playa del Carmen were faring. Unfortunately, despite the quick recovery the airlines were cancelling flights to Cancun left and right. I'll leave that nightmare out of this review, since it has little to do with Playa Maya's service and more to do with Continental (@&%!#&!) and other airlines, but I will mention that Steve put me in touch with a very nice travel agent here in the States who helped us considerably with bringing my wife's (non-English-speaking)mother, sisters, brother-in-law and aunt and uncle to Cancun. The weather was perfect. Playa del Carmen was great (aside from the pushy hawkers who always litter the streets). The great reception staff helped my family with their misc day trips and area questions. Delmy helped us order flowers and a cake from local merchants, who we never would have found on our own. Our wedding under the restaurant palapas was flawless. The mariachis lent a Mexican atmosphere without being too hokey. Steve plugged my iPod in and piped our wedding march and the soundtrack to our reception into a very good, and purportedly new, soundsystem nestled in the palapas rafters. A surprisingly FANTASTIC meal was served, the highlight being the much-raved-about-in-this-forum Coconut Shrimp. After the dinner came the fire dancers, who were at once surreal and entertaining. It was a 20 minute event and afterward each member of my family came to me and confided that this was different than any wedding they had ever experienced. I took it as the compliment it was clearly meant to be. The only negative thing anyone had to say about the hotel was that the pool was kind of dirty. I mentioned this to Steve after everyone had gone and he told me that he was aware of this. Their usual pool-cleaner had taken the holidays off and their handyman was taking care of it along with his other chores, and just hadn't kept on top of it well enough. I had used the pool many times during our previous trip and it had been very clean. I've read lots of negative reviews that centered around the size of the pool. It is a fine pool for puddling around in. If you want to practice your breaststroke, walk the 50 feet to the sea and swim in that, for crying out loud. So, as you can see, I have nothing but praise for the Hotel Playa. The staff was exceptional for such a small \"boutique\" hotel. The management is clearly attentive and love their hotel. The surroundings are fantastic.

We have previously stayed in Playa del Carmen at a top-rated all-inclusive (we hated the stuffiness and unhealthy food), the El Faro next door (which is now closed to be redeveloped as condos). We looked at the rooms at Playa Maya last year and booked there this year. The rooms were half the price of El Faro, and much cleaner than El Faro, although a little smaller. We would have moved to Playa Maya hotel even if El Faro hadn't shut down. We were very happy with the hotel and staff. The rooms are a little sparse, but the price is incredible, the rooms and everywhere else in the hotel are spotlessly clean, and it is quiet even though it's in the middle of town. The fact that there is only one way in and out of the hotel is a positive --- security is really tight and you feel super-safe there. Nobody can \"wander through\" because there is no street access. You get the benefits of seclusion but you're just a block from everything happening on 5th. A couple of staff members aren't quite as friendly, initially, as they might be. But we found if we were nice to them they warmed up after a day or two, and most of the wait staff and front desk people were very nice and certainly accomodating. For some reason, the beds in every hotel we've ever stayed at in Mexico, including the big Cancun hotels, are hard as a rock --- I don't think you can even buy a bed as hard as they have there, in the United States. Thankfully, Playa Maya has really good \"American style\" matresses and for the first time, I didn't wake up with the terrible back ache every morning (and I'm not an old codger --- those beds at the other places were really terrible). Foam vs. feather pillows was also a huge plus, and the staff immediately brought us additional pillows when we requested them. A big plus to this hotel is it's beach. The beach north and south is cluttered with moored fishing boats, and the beach down by the Royale and Blue Parrott stinks of sewer gas all the time. The beach directly in front of the hotel is great! Another plus is the beach services. The guy who sets out all the chaise lounges AND CUSHIONS (the other hotels in the area don't have cushions on the chaises) is fabulous. You're sitting at the restaurant having breakfast and he sets up your chaises for the day, with or without an unbrella as you desire. He also serves food and drinks on the beach, as do the other waiters, which all but one of the nearby hotels do not have. The food is great (the ceviche is fantastic), and the food and drink prices are very reasonable --- our total bill for breakfast (only charges in excess of the gratis continental breakfast cost), lunch 7 days, and tons of drinks (we won't say how many but we were on the beach for 7 of the 8 days), was about $245, including tip. It doesn't get any better than that. My wife and I have read some of the negative reviews of Playa Maya hotel on this forum and I think they all stem from people having unrealistic expectations of what this place is. Playa del Carmen is strange (by traditional American standarads) in that it really doesn't have any American style big resort hotels. It either has big all-inclusives mostly in Playacar, or it has small boutique hotels (non-chains) that are of the European small-hotel ilk. As with small European hotels, you're not going to get room service and a few of the other amenities that might be standard at a big American-style resort at any of the boutique hotels in Playa del Carmen. Anyone who's stayed in small hotels in Europe knows that you're also going to get relatively sparse rooms. One-time visitors to Playa Maya hotel who are expecting the American-style resort are going to be disappointed because that's just not what it is and, most importantly, you're not going to get that anywhere in the area unless you want to go all-inclusive. I don't think that unrealistic expectations that no hotel in the area can satisfy, should be held against Playa Maya hotel. The owner is around and asks you how your visit is going. I've never seen that anywhere else in Playa. And by the way, the bar has the best margarita on the rocks I've ever had --- and we live in Texas so we know a good Margarita when we get one. We booked our rooms late so we had to change rooms for the last two nights of our 8 night stay. We did minor cleaning up but didn't really re-pack and the hotel staff moved everything for us while we were laying on the beach and then brought our new room key right out the beach to us. That's the kind of service I appreciate.

We also stayed four nights in a studio towards the front of the property only a few steps above beach level. I liked the studio a lot. There are two of them A and B and they're set up like studio apartments with everything needed to cook, make coffee, extra pull out sleeper, table with 4 chairs. My wife liked the first floor deluxe room the best which had a big terrace, full hammock and cafe table to sit and watch the ocean and other guest coming and going. The bathrooms are newish, tiled and clean. Plenty of hot water and water pressure went from adequate on the third floor to torrential in the studio. The matresses in all the rooms we stayed in were firm with some give and I was fine but my wife needed a little softer so I bought an egg crate foam at Wal-Mart. The beds are beds not slabs and the mattresses are of good quality which is a problem in even the 4 and 5 star places in Mexico. The beach is really sweet. Plenty of sand, easy to walk in and a few steps from the bar. Stiff winds for a couple of days took some of the sand out but brought it back. The palapa is the place for breakfast with toes in the sand, drinks, lunch and the food was so good we ate an early dinner there twice. The coconut shrimp, sopa azteca, ceviche and fagitas were excellent. Ramon the chef even prepared red snapper which I caught and presented it beautifully. The waiters are attentive and engaging and Mauricio, the bartender is so nice. He made my wife a really cute grasshopper fashioned from a palm leaf.

The staff carried the luggage from Calle 8 past Alhambra Hotel after we announced our arrival by one of us walking up to the restaurant. Switched rooms in middle of our stay due to late booking and found both the rooms clean with an especially nice ocean view in the second room of our stay, 204. Left bathroom window or door open a bit sometimes for the ocean sound which was relaxing, especially at night where this time of year the temperatures were cool. Enjoyed the coffepot (and some yummy mexican granola-breakfast bars) near front desk @ 7am & sat on patio to enjoy the great sunrise view in Cozumel's silhouette. Hotel has a nice covered beachside palapa to sit under when I felt like having some fresh squeezed oj & chicken chilaquiles or huevos rancheros for breakfast. The buffet was removed and items are now ordered off a menu, with hotel guests getting free coffee, oj & toast. We missed the buffet in that it was easy to grab mexican pastries, rolls, & fruit and eat in a short time with our coffee. Moving out to the beach, we got first dibs on the loungers with the newer cushions, quickly hauled into place by the 'chairman of the chairs' . The beach was maybe 8M from palapa to water's edge the first day we were there, but it changed a bit thru our stay, coming and going a little every day. The rockiness on the beach we encountered last year was all covered up. There were a couple of sandbars off the beach in front of the hotel one could stand on & dive shoreward to catch a wave or two. We relaxed much of the day & enjoyed some drinks & light eats.

Had a good fill of the scrumptious coconut shrimp, ceviche & guacamole. For more solid fare we had the very delicious kabobs, especially the mixed variety. These would tide us over to later, where Ave. Quinta is a 4 minute stroll away for evening activities. Found the staff friendly and courteous and willing to help us with special needs & took some photos of us as well. Rooms we kept clean by the staff every day around 11am-1pm. There's a small safe inside for valuables. Not a lot of closet space but there was enough room around for our bags & other things. Tv with cable worked some of the time, but only had it on a few minutes as we were here to relax & get away from it all & didn't even care if there was one in the room. Who needs TV when you can watch the shorebirds and pelicans fly by and just enjoy the beautiful sound of the sea right from the patio! There's a pc available near the check-in desk during business hours in the event one needs to keep up with the internet or what's going on around Playa del Carmen. There's no longer an oceanview gym, but there's a couple of gyms available in town for a fee if one feels a need to workout. It looks like the former gym is becoming an oceanview office for the owners with a guest area for pc / internet use.

The staff (Wendy, Anna) were wonderful to us--they told us that their jobs were to make sure everything was perfect and it was.

The food, especially for lunch, was excellent (chicken tacos, ceviche, hamburgers, guacamole). The included breakfast was \"OK,\" but the staff accommodated special requirements upon request.

We had the upper-level \"family suite\" of adjoining rooms (305 - 306; If you look at pictures of the hotel, you see an upper-level balcony dead-center. That is the divided balcony shared by the family suite.) I'll do the pro - con thing too: PRO 1. The rooms seemed spacious - there was plenty of walking-around room. Good-sized bathrooms and showers. 2. Housekeeping staff did a great job keeping the rooms clean, and the towel sculptures they made were kinda cool. 3. Having a fridge in each room was great, and the stocking of bottled water was appreciated. 4. Beautiful, though somewhat narrow, view of the ocean. 5. We had the option to open the slider to the balcony at night and listen to the surf, while the kids next door could crank the (very efficient) AC to where they wanted it. An earlier reviewer remarked on a snapping noise from the fridge and rooftop tank noises; they barely registered with us. Noise was not a problem - with one exception I'll note below. 6. Location right on the beach, and only a block away from 5th Ave is great. CON 1. TV reception was sometimes clear, sometimes weak. I didn't care much, but kids notice that kind of thing. 2. Noise: On one night (Saturday), a disco several blocks down the beach, decided to move the party - and their very effective loudspeakers - outside. From 11PM to 7AM, the pounding of the surf was replaced by the pounding of a bass, even through closed windows. Apparently enough of the neighboring hotels complained, because it did not happen again for the rest of our stay. The hotel staff expressed their apologies, but it wasn't the hotel's fault. Overall, our \"Saturday Night Fever\" experience was the only thing that kept us from rating the PM as Excellent. We had a great stay, and would certainly keep Playa Maya high on our list if we should return to PDC.", "Date": "January 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "French Riviera", "Title": "\u201cPlaya Maya a good compromise\u201d", "Author": "Torero", "ReviewID": "UR4312198", "Content": "This review is to add to an excellent previous review titled \u201cJust Right for the Money\u201d which I believe to be accurate. I will only make comments to complete according to my experience. PROS : 1.Beach \u2013 You are getting access to the beach at the same price as some similar priced hotels that do not have a beach. In such hotels you will have to walk the beach and find a spot that is not related to a beach side hotel where guards will ask you to leave or put your towels between their restricted area and the water. This is a definite plus with Playa Maya where you have a beach chair guaranteed. This is valuable. 2.Rooms we had ( 305 and 306) can be considered spacious not just regarding the price but comparing with other Hotels. 3.Although the Hotel is close to 5th avenue we were not disturbed by the noise from the street. 4.The review I mentioned above warned about hot water shortage. I did not experience such a problem in our rooms. We were three to take showers in one room and two in the other and we did fine. I don\u2019t know if there are different conditions depending on the room. 5.Rooms had a fridge. One bottle of water in each and some candies. They are large enough to allow you to bring drinks and food back to the hotel. CONS : 1.Entrance to Playa Maya is only by the Beach. No street entrance. I had not realized this when I made my reservation. This was a problem for us because we had a car rental. If you are arriving with your car and/or with a lot of luggage this will be a concern. I had called for directions a couple days in advance and did not get helpful info from the Hotel staff at that time. I had to \u201cwing it\u201d upon arrival and ended up paying 50 pesos to the officer guarding the street to be able to leave my car on 8th Street instead of having to exit the street and find a parking place else where. You need to know that this street is closed to traffic and supervised by a cop. They don't allow you to park on this street. Once you are able to enter the street, you will have to be able to get to the end of the street at beach side. This can be difficult at this time because there is a construction site on the left side going toward the beach. Then you might or might not get help from the Hotel Staff to carry your luggage. We only got help once we reached the hotel on the beach. ( I had called from my cell phone to say we had arrived and to ask how to get to the Hotel and was not offered help ) 2.Noise \u2013 In our rooms we had two noise problems. One was from the fridge that made a loud snapping noise on start up and when it turned off. Another came from what I think to be the water tank refill system on the roof that was extremely loud when in function. This is lasted for less than a minute every hour or so. Finally, it should be mentioned that the sound proofing from room to room and from room to hallway is not good. 3.Last comment will be about the Staff attitude at Playa Maya. I have always been impressed by Mexican\u2019s kindness and willingness to please at hotels and restaurants. In the case of PM my impression was below expectations in this regard. Conclusion : Considering location, access to the beach and price, PM should be among your choices for a stay in Playa del Carmen. If some of the cons concern you and you don\u2019t want to deal with them then you are going to have to put up more money to get what you want. Some reviews have said PM is a dump. This is not the case at all. It is just not a four or five Star Hotel. The pictures on their website are accurate and give the best image possible of the Hotel. It won\u2019t be better than that when you get there. Reality was slightly below my expectations.

No comparison, PM has the best food compared to any of our evening choices. Everything we ordered off the menu was excellent. 4) Rooms - Well furnished, spacious (for the price), clean, well maintained. 5) Staff - Most spoke English well enough to understand. Most performed their jobs in a perfunctory manner. A few went the extra mile, specifically Wendy and Jorge. 6) Beach - Good beach for the area. CONS 1) Hot Water - Be advised there is a five gallon hot water tank in your room, so be prepared for a five minute shower! 2) Breakfast Buffet - This could be expanded. The food was good, but each day, there was one main choice (eggs, fruit, or pancakes) and breads. 3)No security bolts or \"Do not Disturb\" signs for the room doors. 4) Beach Chair Guy - Not sure what the hype is all about.

The room is right by a shallow (4 feet or so) pool, a jacuzzi type pool and a sundeck with chaises and a table that was shady during the afternoon - perfect for babies! I should add that we had it pretty much to ourselves as most people hung out on the beautiful beach. The restaurant/bar is VERY tasty, convenient and fairly priced. We ate breakfast and lunch there every day and enjoyed everything. The shrimp tacos and the ceviche were particularly delicious. The staff could not have been nicer. From the time we arrived (on a van they arranged) to check out, they were fabulous. They provided a pack-and-play for the baby to sleep in and were just so warm and helpful.

Didn't know it existed before. Wow, reading some of the postings I began to wonder if the Playa Maya I stayed at was the same one that received some of the negative articles I read. I have been a visitor to PDC in January for several years. First staying at the Continental Plaza for a couple of years and then opting for a more \"local\" feel moving on to the Pelicano Inn for seven years. Apparent managment problems there prompted a change so I moved next door to the newly built Playa Maya along with some other longtime Pelicano Inn guests, and I have stayed there for the past three years as I will again this January for my annual getaway from the \"gloom and doom\" of the winter weather in the Great Northwest (Oregon). Now my rantings. First off is the complaints about the sometimes rocky beach in front of the hotel. Come on people, nature determines how much sand is on the beach, not the hotel management or staff. Next is the pool. If you go to Mexico to use the pool, you might as well stay home and spend the weekend at a Ramada Inn. There's a big, beautiful ocean out there. Oh my, the bed isn't to my liking. Of course not. It's not the bed you have at home which you are used to. The restaurant isn't to my liking. Be adventurous! Take the short walk up to 5th and check out some of the many marvelous restaurants there. Better yet, venture a a block or two off of 5th and you will find even more excellent places to eat. The staff was rude and inattentive. Maybe you were too demanding as to what you perceived was their shortcoming. After all its a vacation. Relax! Enjoy yourself. As for me, I'll be there in January having the time of my life. Staying in a comfortable, clean room. Lying on a beach chair in the sun visiting with old friends and meeting new ones.

The hotel is nice enough, the staff is friendly and with the exception of a family with noisy kids in the room next door (2004), we never had any real problems. That said, we knew that for our third trip, we wanted to stay at the Playa Maya, based on all of the positive feedback that I had read on the Playa Info forums. To say the least, I was not disappointed. The hotel is flawlessly maintained, the location is superb (right on the beach) and the rooms are well sized, clean and comfortable. We stayed for a total of 12 days, and didn't have a single problem. The entire staff is very friendly and the process of booking the hotel was a pleasure (unlike the El Tukan). Suffice it to say, we will be staying at the Playa Maya on all of our future vacations in Playa. If you read any negative reviews on this site, about this hotel, disregard them. It's a shame, no matter how nice the destination, some people aren't happy unless they're complaining.", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cdid not fall in love with playa maya\u201d", "Author": "mmonkey", "ReviewID": "UR4006586", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Playa Maya for part of our honneymoon in June.

The beach at Playa Maya is not the best along the strip, if you are intersted in nice beach there are a few beatiful spots a short walk away. Playa Maya's is pretty small and very close to the resaurant which is usually playing music, good for sipping margaritas but not for a nap.

The delay amazed me. The restaurant was not busy at all, there were at least four waiters on duty. And still a whopping 10 minutes to get some salsa.

Having been a little extravagant at the Riu Palce and Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach last month, we decided to scale down money-wise this time. I have to admit, I'd heard so many good things about Playa Maya, I didn't think it could possibly live up to it all. I was certainly wrong! Playa Maya was everything and MORE than I expected! We loved our Deluxe Terrace room with a hammock, pub table and chairs, and also 2 Adirondack chairs and small table. The view was supposedly \"obstructed,\" but only by the roof of the restaurant, which I felt only added to the beauty of the view. I have some evening photos of the full moon shining down on the ocean and the hotel that are beautiful. Our room was quite large with plenty of drawers and storage for my husband's diving equipment and my excessive suitcases! Everything had a very clean, new feeling to it and the room was very comfortable with a nice coziness. We especially liked the nice walk in shower. The restaurant was excellent-be sure to try the Shrimp Tacos and Guac! I was in Heaven when we ordered Pina Coladas and they made them the \"original\" way with fresh pineapple juice and creme of coconut instead of the premix that most hotels-even the Riu Palace-use now. The Banana Coladas were even better and made with fresh bananas! The pool is small and the sundeck only had 4 chairs on it, BUT I never saw anyone use it, so you really have it all to yourself! There is a nice, wide beach, the palapa with tables for meals or drinks, and a beachside masseuse. We found the entrance on the beach to be a definite plus. Our driver went to the front desk upon arrival and immediately came back with 3 Playa Maya employees to carry our luggage to the reception area. Check-in was very smooth. Ana was very helpful to us throughout our stay-very sweet young lady! There is always a night security guard at the entry. Since you enter from the sand, and the entry, right beside the restaurant, is small, it's impossible for anyone to get by him, the bartender, and the front desk to get to the rooms. We felt very secure in our room. The location--on the beach, a block from 5th Ave. and close to several excellent restaurants-can't be beat. We were very impressed and will surely return to Playa Maya. My only disappointment was that we didn't get to meet Steve!

Even the bed was very confortable which I find rare in Mexico. The hotel is right on the beach. Breakfast, lunch or drinks under the palapa on the beach was sooo relaxing, not to mention the hammock swings. The only negatives are out of the control of the hotel. The beach directly in front of the hotel was worn and rocky. From what I understand this changes constantly and could be rocky one day and sandy the next. Still this was no problem at all though. A 50-100 yard stroll to the north has one of the best beaches in the area. Also with the hotel having \"beach only access\" there was the minor issue of sand in your shoes or sandals when heading into town. Really, that was no big deal. If you want value this hotel can not be beat. We paid $130 USD per night with a deluxe ocean view room. This is from a hotel ON THE BEACH!

At first, I was quite displeased with our room. We recieved room 101 with the deluxe terrace on the ground floor. I told our agent with Worldlinks that we wanted a room with a view of the ocean. We could see the ocean but it was an obstructed view looking partially at the ocean and partially at the rooftop of the Playa Maya beach club bar. My wife, Starlene calmed me down and we decided just to go with what we were given. The owner/manager Steven Ryberg called the next day explained that it was the room that Worldlinks and I had decided upon and that he would be more than happy to switch me to another room but the hotel was fully occupied. By that time, I only wanted to get into vacation mode and really didn't want to press the point any longer, so Steve and I mutually agreed to let it be. It was probably what the Good Lord wanted us to have anyway because I continued to strain my right knee so being on the ground floor turned out to be a blessing. Our room was spartan but clean. The bathroom a bit small but clean and functional. The water pressure is half of what it is in the states because it is gravity fed from the rooftop but will get you clean. Very high quality thick towels. They only give you the minimun though. One wash, hand and body towel per person, per day. Good quality TV with remote, small refrig, excellent air conditioning, and probably one of the very best hotel king size beds we have slept on. It was the same size wide but it seemed just a bit shorter than a standard king. The sheets crisp, white, cool, clean with probably 180 to 200 thread count. Very good quality pillows also. The sleep quality was excellent because of where the Playa Maya is located. It is located between two older hotels, the Pelicano and the Alhambra on the beach. It was very quiet throughout every night and we never heard any of the goings on from 5th Avenue which at times can be very noisy. The Playa Maya beach club, open to all, serves the best valued cocktails in Playa del Carmen. At least of what we found. Also some of the best food for the consideration given. Nothing too extravagent on the menu but the quality exceeded the prices. Thank you to Racielle and Juacien, two wonderful young amigos who were our servers during the week. A short comment about the staff. Melissa, Anna and Mayta thank you so much for all of your help, advice and service to Starlene and I. We all know that there are quite a few other people behind the curtain who help make the success of a hotel. We want to thank you all, for cleaning our room, washing our clothes, helping us pack up unruly larger gifts, your graciousness and sweetness of character overall. Who you all are made our vacation a memorable experiance. Thank you. A quick note about Playa del Carmen. Beautiful, but in a place of development in that it can become something very wonderful or tragic. The water, electrical, sewage and roads do not seem to be keeping pace with the explosive growth of the community. Many Mexican establishments, especially resturants do not see the importance of clean restrooms or toilets with toilet seats. Hawkers, in front of their shops can be rude, caustic and annoying, especially the nearer you are to the Cozumel ferry area. Often, many service people verbally hussel you for tips. A practice that would be a terminating event for most service employees in the U.S. Many of these people have not yet understood that by husseling they are degrading themselves and with my wife and I usually devalue their gratuity from 15% or better to 10% or less. Never once was I ever husseled by any employee of the Playa Maya. That was a small blessing. In conclusion, the Playa Maya was clean and quiet with the best quality I saw for a reasonable rate in PDC. I believe that for an $80. to a $150 budget, chances are you will do worse if you stay at another hotel near the 5th avenue area. Although my wife and I will probably not return to PDC we do reccommend this hotel to other adventurers and sun-seekers.", "Date": "April 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cAnnual Mexico rendevous\u201d", "Author": "LakeSammamish", "ReviewID": "UR3324146", "Content": "For the third year we (hghschool classmates/spouses from 1972) have visited Mexico (March 17 -25) for a spring break vacation.

They want your stay to be pleasant and will bend over backwards to accomodate special requests such as a Super Bowl Party.

Rooms have lots of space to move around and the beds are very comfortable, not slabs like others in Mexico and as mentioned before, the hotel is kept very clean. Food and drinks are great and comparable in price to other places in town. The beach is the best stretch, in our opinion, in this area and the beach chairs with the new cushions are great.

Here is my review of the hotel and what it had to offer. Please keep in mind that I am well-traveled in Mexico and in other places throughout the world including Spain, Jamaica, Portugal, France and Morrocco. This was my 6th visit to the country and I have stayed in All Inclusives and Independently Arranged boutique hotels. I must say that we thoroughly enjoyed our vacation, as we always do in Mexico. While we like to try staying at new places, eating at different restaurants, and exploring new places, we have come to enjoy the independently arranged boutique hotels, like Playa Maya better than the All Inclusives. I do have to say that this time around, the Playa Maya was one of our favorite places to stay. First the positives: - Very prompt and courteous check-in..say hi to Filo for me! - Their beach attendent, Feliciano cheerfully lugged our heavy suitcases at check-in as well as promptly had our cushioned beach chairs ready for us each day with a smile. - Service was great, people were very kind and wanted to suit your needs. - Noone was ever discourteous to us in any way - Great location as the entrance leads right out onto the beach and the main drag, 5th avenue is right around the corner, yet the hotel is perfectly quiet from the sometimes raucous 5th avenue activity. - Super Clean hotel. - Nice music around their beach palapa restaurant area. - Great bar/drink service. - Personalized attention by the owner, Steve - I really enjoyed the variety of rooms that I could pick from to ensure I had what I wanted when I arrived! Now the negatives: (and these are only little, picky items) - They don't serve dinner in the evening at their great, casual beach restaurant (although they did happily prepare the fish we caught one evening). We enjoyed many fine lunches there (try the coconut shrimp)! - The pool, which is smaller than most, was delightfully designed and a nice quiet reprieve when you didn't want to be on the beach (which was hardly ever!). As with most good hotels, you really get to pick and choose the room that you want to meet your specific requirements. If you want a great, clean hotel with a super friendly staff; outside the door, wonderful beach location; great beach restaurant for easy access to munchies and a cold one when you really need it, and you are looking for a hotel with easy access to the fun on 5th avenue, without all the noise at night..then the Playa Maya is for you!", "Date": "March 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, NC", "Title": "\u201cLoved Playa Maya\u201d", "Author": "SusieQ", "ReviewID": "UR3268229", "Content": "My husband & I stayed at this great beachfront hotel, as did our friends. We loved it! The staff is terrific, the rooms (we were in the Garden Room) were roomy and super clean. The maids made different arrangements with our towels every day (my friend & I compared the different designs - a pair of swans, interlocking hearts, etc. - I know this sounds girly, but it was a nice touch). The rooms had cable TV, and there were several channels in English. The hotel provides comfortable beach chaises, with huge beach towels. The hotel is centrally located such that you are but one block from the main restaurant/bar drag. The beachfront bar was terrific (the waiters patiently accepted my somewhat slaughtered Spanish and my husbands tendency to put an \"o\" on every word as if that somehow made it understandable).

In an area full of all-inclusive mega-resorts, we were so happy to find a small unpretentious but charming hotel right on Playa del Carmen's fantastic white sand beach. It's crammed in cheek by jowl with other small hotels, but this did not detract from the comfort of the place. The rooms are spacious, extemely clean, simply and attractively furnished. The hotel personnel are very friendly and helpful. The location couldn't be better if you like easy access to Avenida Quinta where all the action is but want a quiet night's sleep and a view of the blue, blue ocean.

The friendly employees and service couldn\u2019t be beat. Our room was very clean and beautiful and we had a great unobstructed view. Every morning after we left the room it would be promply cleaned and they would leave towel art and bottled water. The pool is small, but my husband and I had little interest in that since the beautiful ocean and waves were only feet away. We saw people hanging around the pool, but never saw anyone in it. The food is excelent and people staying all over PDC go there to eat. You\u2019ve got to try the Playa Maya coconut shrimp, it\u2019s the best we have had. The beach in front of the hotel was probably one of the best areas with very few rocks and not as crowded as other places up and down the beach. Juaquim always had a couple cold Dos Equis waiting for us and made our experience at the Playa Maya even better with his kindness and attention to detail. If you can\u2019t find a lounger on the beach the guys at the Playa Maya will find one for you and set it up wherever you want. We will definatly be returning to the Playa Maya in the future. One thing to keep in mind is that this hotel has quite a following and some of the (smart) regular visitors actually make reservations for the same time next year as they check out. Make your reservations way in advance! The Playa Maya only had one room available for the first week of our stay in PDC, and after that we unfortunately had to switch hotels. We were so spoiled at the Playa Maya that the second hotel didn\u2019t have a chance and on several occasions we deserted our new hotel to hang out at the Playa Maya. We highly recommend this hotel, it is fabulous.

The staff was very nice and attentive, the beach was lovely & the hotel was clean. Nice airconditioning if that's what you're into. Wasn't happy with a few things though. The \"free\" breakfast included white bread toast & butter and coffee. That was all, plus they were a half hour late opening the restaurant for breakfast. We were told we had a garden room with a garden patio & hot tub. It ended up being a basement room (so not much light) with a shaftway that had some plants in it and a small hot tub. That was no \"garden patio\"! The photos on the internet were decieving. The patio did not look at all like the shaftway that it was. Also, the hotel is so tiny-- and it's crammed in between 2 other hotels... the pool is pretty much useless... it's tiny and the entrance to the tiny lobby (which isnt really a lobby-- it's more like a hallway) is a bridge that goes over the pool. So there's really no sun there and you feel sort of dumb sunning yourself there while people are walking back and forth. No one ever used the pool there. We had a rental car, and they had 2 spots on the street that the hotel used. You needed a key to unlock the spot to park there, and one nite we came back at 10 PM, and the guy with the key had gone home, so we had to go look for a parking spot elsewhere. They also played loud bad hip hop music in the bar which I hated (but that's just my taste).", "Date": "February 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel and Staff!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3104668", "Content": "My fiancee' and I went to Playa Maya in April of 2003 and we had incredible time. The hotel is spotless, cute, and has a great staff. I believe we were the first couple ever to have gotten engaged while staying at the Playa Maya (my proposal spot has since been replaced by a cool patio). Although the Avenida has a ton of great restaurants (and so does the beach) we found ourselves eating most our meals right at Playa Maya. The food is excellent and I long for having breafast and coffee on the beach. When Steve and his staff found out we got engaged, they went out of their way to make us feel good. My family called from the US and wanted to buy us a bottle of champagne. Since the Playa Maya bar didn't stock it, they went far past the Avenida to find a place to get us a great bottle. We came back to our room and there it was in an ice bucket, with some other nice treats. Usually when I travel I'm anxious to get home. I did NOT want to leave Playa Maya.
