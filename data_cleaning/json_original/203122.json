It is fairly clean but dated. HOWEVER, its location is superb! You are just steps from the famous Piazza Navona where you can enjoy all the outdoor cafes and activities of the season. The taxi stand is literally outside the front door of the hotel. You can walk down the street and catch the hop on, hop off bus for approx 19 euro for an all-day pass, which will take you to all the famous sites. (I highly suggest the RED bus only. Expect to be husselled to take green or blue bus, but DO NOT fall for this one). Also, Genio Hotel has a charming rooftop cafe where you can enjoy your free breakfast and view the sites of the city. The downside to this hotel is that the concierges are not extremely helpful. They don't have much information on buses, trains, fares, or activities other than to perhaps recommend their friends. We had asked the concierge for a restaurant with a good atmosphere, music and good wine and he suggested somewhere he used to work. We just accidentally stumbled upon Piazza Navona as we were trying to find that restaurant . The Piazza met all those requirements!! I would still recommend this hotel as it is so centrally located and reasonably priced that I believe it's a good value!

You also need to be able to walk a few steps in the stairs to get to the breakfast room. The location is excellent.

My girlfriend and I stayed for three nights at the beginning of our week long trip to Italy. We arrived on a Saturday morning around 10am with our bags in tow. At first glance it has a nice street presence in a neat, clean area of town just blocks from the Tiber River. We didn't expect our rooms to be ready and they weren't. However, the gentleman manning the front desk politely held our bags with him in a secure area until a room was ready around 1pm. We came back after exploring a couple of hours and checked in. Our room was good size with one full bed and a very large bathroom with tub. The room appeared clean but smelled like it was a smoking room. The view was not appealing overlooking the busy street in front of the hotel on the second floor. The street noise did prove to be a big negative at night because we wanted to sleep with the windows open to get some cool air. In all fairness, we didn't ask for another room because we figured it would be a hassle and were a little afraid we may be given a smaller room with other potential issues. Bathroom was nice and large, especially for a big city. The only complaint (and it is a big one) was that the water wasn't hot in the morning. It was great at night but not hot while we were getting ready between 8 and 9am. We just showered at night which was fine for a few days. Hotel staff were somewhat friendly. Not overly helpful and I did see them get into disagreements with some of the other guests for various reasons. The best part about the hotel is the location. It was perfectly located so we could walk to many of our destinations. It was also close to the \"hop on hop off\" buses we used the first two days. The Vatican is about a 10 minute walk and the Colosseum was about a 20 minute walk (we walked it once but to the bus the other times we were near it). Piazza Navone is few minutes away with a number of restaurants. Breakfast was included which was a huge plus. Great continental selection of fruit, pastries, cheese, yogurt, coffee, juice, etc. It was so helpful to get a good meal and hit the sights right away each day. Here is a breakdown of what we liked and disliked... PROS: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION Large Room Large Bathroom Great rooftop view Clean room Reasonably priced wi-fi connection Breakfast CONS: Room smelled like smoke Street noise at night Water didn't get hot in the morning No English speaking channels on the TV The hotel worked for what we were looking for--a moderately priced hotel with the basics and a convenient location.

The song Up On the Roof says it all. The furthest major sight is the Colosseum, a bit of a trek but all the other high spots are easily reachable on foot. For fantastic eating value at night we recommend you sail past the more expensive restaurants pitched at tourists and try Gino & Pietro's in Vicolo Savelli (if you can put up with the uneven cobbled street and proximity of scooters) - we usually had two courses wine and water for 28 - 34 Euro for two! The mixed bruschetta is wonderful, lovely spaghetti alla vongole, Saltimbocca alla Romana, tortellini cacio e pepe, pasta with ragu - everything is delicious and so reasonable. The house wines, white and red are very drinkable and so cheap.

They never had the decency to respond after numerous attempts to contact them. (I know they received our emails. When I sent another email with a different return address asking about a future reservation, they quickly responded). This is no way to treat a customer. Here is our story - as told to Leonardi in our complaint: Dear Sir: We have been staying at your Hotel Genio property since Sunday, July 15 in two rooms. Last night, as you may already know, the fire alarm sounded at approximately 12:45 AM (00:45). While this can happen anywhere, the response of the hotel staff was completely inadequate, creating confusion and distress among the hotel\u2019s guests. The night manager on duty, having no idea what to do when the alarm went off, simply stood behind the desk and did nothing. He did not even know whether it was a real or a false alarm. Later we were told that he had checked the building, but I was one of the first people in the lobby immediately after the alarm sounded and I can tell you he did nothing. In fact, he refused to call either the police or the fire department. In the absence of assistance from the hotel, a few guests took it upon themselves to first alert all guests and get them out of the building. Then we began demanding that the manager call the police, and absent any action on his part, attempted to use cell phones and pay phones to reach the police, even going so far as to walk around the neighborhood in search of help. In the end, we, your guests, stood outside the hotel for over an hour before any additional hotel management arrived, and it was another 20 minutes before the police finally arrived. No explanations were offered; no attempt to make us comfortable was made. Eventually we were told that it was safe to return to the hotel, but since nobody had yet checked the building for any possible smoke or fire conditions, most of us were unwilling to take the manager\u2019s word. It was 2:30 AM by the time the police and firefighters added their assurances and we went back to our rooms. I have characterized the hotel\u2019s response as inadequate. Your manager on duty was clearly not prepared for an emergency. His refusal to contact any emergency personnel is beyond comprehension. Another hotel guest repeatedly asked to see a written copy of the emergency response procedure, but it could not be located. We were even more concerned for our safety because earlier in the evening we were told that the hotel\u2019s outside phone lines were not working. We were fortunate that this was a false alarm. Had it been an actual fire, there is no doubt that the hotel\u2019s response would have resulted in injuries and loss of life. We expect much better of a hotel in the Leonardi group. We considered checking out this morning, but decided to complete the 3-night stay we originally booked through venere.com. We will be checking out as planned tomorrow morning.

During the first week of April we booked a room for hotel Genio for July 14, 15, 16 &17 with this hotels website Leonardihotels.com which claims you will receive the best rates available. I received what I thought was a reliable e-mail confirmation from Leonardi hotels for those dates with an excellent rate. When we arrived for our stay on July 14 we were informed that the hotel was overbooked and we would be staying at another Leonardi hotel named La Sistina which is located in the vicinity of the Spanish steps. I planned this trip many months in advance and chose this hotel mainly for its location which is very close to Piazza Navona. I had no intention or desire to stay in another part of the city. Since I had booked the room three months in advance it was difficult to understand why my room was not available. As I protested this to the hotel desk clerk he stated my booking agent must have mistakenly booked a room in a hotel that had no availability. When I produced a copy of my confirmation and explained that I had booked through the hotels very own website his response was that the manager had overbooked and there was nothing he could do for me. I requested to speak with the manager but was told he was not available. After repeatedly denying my request to speak with management the clerk agreed that I had a legitimate complaint but nothing could be done. His only assistance was to offer a taxi to the other hotel. At this point I was becoming increasingly frustrated and angry with the situation. Not only did we get scammed but the hotels response was terrible. The manager was afraid to face us and left his dirty work to the young desk clerk. Their main concern was just getting us out of the lobby as quickly as possible so we wouldn\u2019t alarm any other guest of the hotel. Since we had nowhere else to go we had no choice but accept the offer for the hotel La Sistina. To make matters worse the La Sistina was dirty had no hot water when we tried to shower in the afternoon and was in a terrible location. I immediately started calling around for another place to stay and was lucky enough to get a room at the Portoghesi hotel which is located just around the corner from the hotel Genio. Hotel Genio\u2019s policy of overbooking and then down grading your accommodations along with their arrogant and harsh treatment is bad business and definitely not a common practice in Italy. I traveled throughout the country over the last two years on two separate vacations and never encountered this problem.

The hotel re-confirmed and said I booking was reconfirmed. When we arrived the hotel informed us that there was a problem with our booking so we had to be taken to Hotel Elisio near the Spanish Steps. This really upset me. We only had to stay there one night mind. We then got a free taxi to Hotel Genio on the 17th and then that's where all the other problems began... We had a powercut for 3 days, no TV, not lights, no AC. Because there are no windows in the hall ways you couldn't see a thing. I had to be guided up the stairs by my husband flicking a lighter. No candles were offered but eventually put at the top of the stairs. Of course during our time Rome was experiencing a heat wave so having no AC was unbearable.

ADVANTAGES The hotel is just steps away from Piazza Navona and just a couple of blocks from the Vatican! The Colloseum & Trevi Fountain are further away, but if you don't mind walking a bit, it's still within a reasonable walking distance. It was extremely close to lots of restaurants. The hotel is clean and presentable, rooms are reasonably sized and comfy, baths are clean. Our first room was incredibly warm but when the ac finally got started, the room cooled down nicely. When we left the room, either the housekeeping staff would turn off the ac or it would turn off automatically because everytime we came back it was hot again. They served a cold buffet breakfast. I would have expected some hot items but at least they had some variety, like fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals. Roof patio was very pretty with pretty views. Most of the hotel service was nice but some were not too helpful. Now for the DISADVANTAGES: Hotel was noisy!! I kept hearing banging and lots of clattering very early in the morning. One day, a loud alarm kept going off. At first it sounded like the hotel fire alarm or an alarm coming from the street. I was about to get up to investigate when it finally stopped. Our room ran out of hot water! It was 11PM when we realized that there was no hot water and that only one set of towels were given. I went to the lobby to report it. The guy behind the desk informed me that there wasn't anything he could do since it was so late at night and housekeeping had already left. He said all other rooms were filled except for one which had no working ac. Our only option was to keep our same room but go shower in the vacant room with no ac. Not convenient since our room was on the 1st floor and the vacant one was on the 5th floor. Fortunately, the 5th floor had hot water, even though you really didn't need it since the whole room was so hot with no AC and luckily they had left spare towels in there. Unfortunately the shower door was broken so we had to deal with that ourselves. Atleast this happened on our last night there. I can not honestly say that staying at this hotel made our trip unenjoyable but it could have made it more comfortable for us.

Three people travelling, booked a single and a twin room. Twin room \u00a350 per person per night, for bed and breakfast, an absolute bargain for this location in Rome, at this time. I emailed Leonardi Hotels direct prior to our stay to confirm the reservations. Thankfully, on arrival there were no horror stories to report re overbooking, as has happened previously to far too many unfortunate guests. There were no details from previous Trip Advisor reviews if this had happened with direct bookings only, perhaps this is the case as I\u2019m sure booking agents such as Easyjet/HotelBeds would not want the flack if this was usual practise with booking made through them. The rooms were located on the same floor, near each other and facing the quieter side street. Noise was not a problem as the windows were sound proofed, closed all during our stay and the air conditioning left on constantly. The air conditioning was more than adequate in the single room but on a couple of occasions the same sized a/c unit in the twin room didn\u2019t keep us as cool as we would have liked. A fan was borrowed from reception for the duration of our stay and made the room more comfortable when needed. The rooms and bathrooms were immaculate, bedding and towels changed daily. All rooms had satellite TV, complimentary toiletries and a reasonably priced minibar. Safety deposit boxes were available in reception at \u20ac3 per day. Rooms were large on floor space and storage. Bathrooms were finished in marble, larger than expected and had powerful showers. The roof terrace was quiet, covered in lovely flowering pots, with plenty of tables and chairs and caught the sun all day. A great place to sit and relax after a busy day sightseeing with a magnificent view of St Peter\u2019s Basilica. The plastic chairs were of poor quality, more befitting a street side cafe than a four star hotel. Umbrellas would have been nice, to avoid the baking sun and perhaps a reason guests decided not to frequent during the day. We were lucky enough to have the exclusive use of the roof terrace throughout most of our stay. The downstairs bar closed at 9.30 pm which was disappointing and perhaps more guests would have used the terrace if this had not been the case and the terrace lighting had been on. The cold buffet breakfast was disappointing for a four star hotel. Plenty of juice, fresh fruit, yoghurts, cereals, hard boiled eggs, ham, cheese and cakes. The waitress had to be asked to replace items which would result in a ten minute wait. Tea and coffee were served at your table and on one occasion were cold, as the machine wasn\u2019t working. Rather than tell guests that it would take ten minutes to boil water, you were served cold drinks. The breakfast room is rather small and bland, what a wasted opportunity that breakfast is not available on the roof terrace, which is undoubtedly the strong point of the Genio. Of course you can take your breakfast up to the roof terrace but as the lift seemed to have a mind of its own a lengthy wait ensued. The staff at Hotel Genio were helpful, but not overly friendly, at all times. Taxis were organised for various sightseeing trips for us by the hotel and arrived within minutes. Staying so near Piazza Navona was wonderful, having such a fabulous location as our \u201clocal\u201d for a nightcap could not be beaten. Despite having been to Rome on other occasions we had never ventured west of Piazza Navona previously but discovered lovely pedestrianised street full of restaurants and shops. These were busy but not as busy as the usual Piazza Navona \u2013 Pantheon beaten track in the opposite direction and were so cheap in comparison.

We have stayed at some of the best hotels. This year, we were celebrating our 25th anniversary. We stayed at the Hotel Genio in Rome for 6 nights in September. We found the hotel to be more than adequate. The location is wonderful, right in the heart of the city at Piazza Navona, with great restaurants and within walking distance of every major site. We found the staff to be friendly and accommodating. Our room, # 608, was comparable to North American standards, very clean, though it needed some refurbishing. It had a queen sized bed and plenty of room to move around as well as good closet space. Our bathroom was a nice size with modern amenities, including a real hair dryer (however no bathtub to relax in after a full day of walking!). There is also a nice rooftop terrace on the sixth floor with breathtaking views of Rome and St. Peter's. The breakfast was good -- fruits, croissants, muffins, breads, cereals, meats, cheeses, and hardboiled eggs and great coffee. We were quite happy with this hotel and would definitely stay there again and would not hesitate to recommend the Genio to friends! This hotel was booked through the Venere Hotel reservation site. This was our third hotel booked with Venere on this trip and we had no complications whatsoever and all the hotels were exactly what we expected. We also recommend the Venere website for hotel bookings.

I contacted the booking company and i was told that the reservation was valid and not cancelled. My wife and I just traveled over 12 hours and were very tired so took the move to a different hotel (which was a nice one but near the Train Station very far away from the Central part of Rome...I picked this hotel for location not price)...When my wife and I returned to Rome (after a cruise) we did have a room but it was terrible as described above...I would never stay at Genio Hotel, as the room, at least the one we had) was terrible and I belive they bait and switch people who are STUCK in a foreign city.

Two days before we were due to arrive, I called the central reservations desk for Leonardi Hotels to check the reservations and obtain a reservation number direct from the company as well as the e-mail confirmations I had through the holiday company. I also called the hotel direct and booked a car to meet us at the airport. We were duly met by a driver whose mobile phone rang once we were in the car. The call was from the receptionist at Hotel Genio who advised me that there had been a problem with the bookings, the hotel was overbooked and we did not have rooms there but at a sister hotel, Hotel Eliseo. Hotel Genio is very central in Rome which is why we choose the hotel - Hotel Eliseo is not central! It is a good 25 minutes walk north of the Hotel Genio. After a heated discussion, it was pretty obvious that we had no choice but to take second best and check into Hotel Eliseo. We walked to Hotel Genio on the same day and found a foyer full of people who had all made reservations to stay there and were being advised which hotel in the Leonardi Hotels group they had been reassigned to for their stay. The Leonardi Hotels group obviously uses Hotel Genio as the lure due to the location, takes overbookings and then transfers guests to the sister hotels - all of which are some distance from the centre of Rome. Beware - it would appear this is how the group operates all the time.

The hotel had access to a garage so it worked out, but it cost $$$ and I didn't use it in the city - so next time, I'll rent a car as I leave Rome, and save the headache and cost.
