I was patient enough to give it a 3rd attempt and asked if there's room available during my requested time-NO response.

My client booked this hotel for me as the rate was very attractive then (below HKD1000 inclusive of breakfast). The room is of course brand new, very modern, kind of eco-friendly and extremely hi-tech. The TV comes with a 50-inch screen, a big i-pad awaits you at the bedside, so on and so forth; you won't be disappointed as far as the room is concerned. We also used the ballrooms for some events; the banquet staff was courteous but breakfast was very mediocre. What went wrong during my stay (I think 4 nights) was that the staff wasn't properly trained in terms of processes and protocol. 1. The lobby is often empty with no staff manning the reception because check-in is supposed to be done on one of the higher floors. If however no one is on the ground floor how would we know about that? 2. The daily package came with free drinks in the fridge but I wasn't told. My other colleague who checked in was told and I only found out on the last night. 3. I gave the staff my credit card and passport upon check-in, the lady used an i-pad to key in the details but to my amazement, I was told they didn't have my records when I checked out. All these go to show that technology wouldn't help that much if the staff wasn't trained. 4. One afternoon, I was in the room on a business call. The housekeeping staff rang the bell but I couldn't answer it. Within a few seconds, he opened the door with his card key and I was just in a bathrobe! 5. Yet another night, I tried to get the Front Desk to give me a wake-up call. I tried calling many times within 1.5 hours but no one picked up. The next day, I was told that the staff incidentally left his post to attend to something else. I couldn't believe it, it's supposed to be a 24-hour service and he left his post for more than an hour? 6. When I first walked into my room, it smelled of tobacco (it's supposed to be a no-smoking floor). The manager came over and told me that they couldn't do anything about it if some other guests chose to smoke on a non-smoking floor. While this might be true, I find the response inappropriate and undiplomatic. Having said that though, the hotel's only restaurant offers great Japanese and Italian fusion food. The sashimi is fresh and the dessert wonderful! I was in HK again last week and the client threw a party at the hotel. Our meal with a party of 17 took 3 hours to complete, though the restaurant had no more than 4 tables to serve on that night! All in all, the hotel I think has much to improve on but the rate is attractive enough for someone who doesn't mind the distance and the occasional clumsy service.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, null, Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Basje_74", "ReviewID": "UR132627620", "Content": "Excellent service, clean, good quality room.
