A warm welcome with very secure accommodation that has all the creature comforts of home; TV, Wi-Fi, kettles, toaster\u2019s etc I would say the bed is a little small for my 6ft 2\u201d frame + wife; but the bed was very comfortable and the apartment was very clean. The only criticism would be: 1) The TV did not have any English Channels; an English news channel would have been nice; but the apartment does have Wi-Fi and in retrospect I should have taken my laptop. 2) Noise does echo in the stairwell when people are talking, which can be annoying! Just a reality check; Barcelona is a expensive city; on par with London. The entrance to all the major attractions can be expensive but if offered the audio guide take it for at least the Bas\u00edlica de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia & Picasso Museum as I felt I learned alot.

Yes it is somewhat noisy but it is extremely central. You always tend to have to make a trade off. On our 1st trip to Barcelona we stayed in a very nice quiet 4 star hotel but it was too far from the centre of the city and a pain to get around. This time we were prepared for it to be a little noisy but jumped at the chance of being central. The relative cost was great and contrary to other reviews I would definately stay again. The only slight pain was that we arrived on the weekend and had to go to there offices 3km away to pick up the keys(advise a cab ride). There were people hanging around outside but its so central and the same as any major city center in our experience.

They were there for two hours, left the apartment and literally got ten steps away when they were mugged by 6 men. This was in broad daylight, outside shops and the shop keepers literally laughed at them. They are all over 60 and could not believe what had happened. They went back into the apartment and were told by the receptionist that they would have to go to the police station as they do not come out to you. My mum and one of her friends had there bags literally ragged off them so they went to the police station, they were there for four hours, not offered a drink or anything and were laughed at which obviously made them very upset. They were then told nothing could be done regarding their passports and there was no Embassy open until Monday. My two sisters and I had to get a flight out on Saturday morning to take them there medication that had also been stolen and they were told 'no doctors' are here for you. The apartment, although very small was nice and clean but the noise was very bad. On Sunday morning at about 9.30, a man came along with his bolt cutters and started stealing the bikes that were chained up outside. I passerby asked him what he was doing and he threatened her so she just carried on about her business. I would say if you have no choice but to go to Barcelona then the apartment is nice but in a very rough area. We got 'flashed' by a man in the middle of the street at 9 pm in the evening when there was loads of people around. We also spoke to other people who had been robbed either from their car - being told to pull over as they had a flat wheel and then getting robbed whilst they got out to have a look - or getting their bag ripped from them like my mum and her friend. I am disgusted at the way the authorities did not offer them any assistance whatsoever and have vowed never to return to that godforsaken place EVER AGAIN. If you do go please be careful, this has totally ruined my mother and her friend. They have gone from being out-going fun loving people to ladies who were scared to go out of the door.

Because the apartments are on a pedestrian only area you will have to walk little bit in order to get there. Thats why we'd recomment to use the train instead. Even though you must get the keys from another location the taxi would cost much less if you take it from the train station than from the airport (we paid 40 euros). The train ticket costs about 2,5 euros. 3. Paper-thin walls. You are going to hear everything your neighbours say or do. Noise from outside can sometimes considered annoying. If you want absolute quiteness to get asleep dont stay there. 4. The apartment is small when the sofabed is used. There is no space to walk from the one side of the apartment to the other when when the sofa bed is open, so you must climb over the bed or sofa. 5. You have to buy your own disk detergents and soap.

We travelled as a family of four, two adults and two children - one aged 7 and the other aged 5.

Having originally checked out the reviews on this site, I was a bit sceptical about booking this apartment but I was pleasantly surprised. It was awkward to get to; we had to collect the keys from a completely different location/my limited Spanish enabled me to ascertain from the taxi driver that he was unable to drive us up to the door of the apartment - it would have probably cost us another 10 euros by the time he had driven around the one-way system - and we had to walk but that turned out to be only about 100 metres (I suppose this could have proved difficult if you had too many bags but as we didn't, it was okay). The one downside was the fact that in the ground floor apartment we were allocated, the sofabed in the living area was on its last legs - literally - and wasn't very comfortable so I would say the owner should take note and replace it as it spoils an otherwise lovely, modern apartment. Also, the tip to take a tour bus was spot on - it enabled us to see a lot of the wonderful city for a small cost and minimum amount of fuss - excellent. I would definitely recommend Barcelona for a visit and the apartments are ideally situated for that.
