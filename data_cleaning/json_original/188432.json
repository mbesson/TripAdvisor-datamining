In terms of cleanliness there is nothing to criticise. The location is great, walking distance to Vieux-Montr\u00c3\u00a9al and rue Ste. Catherine with downtown Montr\u00c3\u00a9al. However, I have stayed at this hotel on a previous visit to Montr\u00c3\u00a9al and altough I paid less, my room was larger and more comfortable. I booked an online rate, two twin beds, but was quite disappointed with the size of the room. As I said, I have stayed here earlier booking a similar room, that at least in my memory appeard larger. At least the bed. With a width of 100cm, calling it a \"twin\" is really more of a French style twin... The beds were not comfortable and the pillows even worse for my taste. Additionally, on my arrival the hotel garage was full, so I had to park my car at another garage. Even though I knew parking would be charged extra, had the hotel website stated more clearly, that the garage might not be available, I would have made different travel arrangements (either chosing a different hotel or returning the rental car earlier instead). That is very inconvenient and a reason for me, not to return to this hotel. The door to my room did not open properly and required a lot of force. I reported this to the front desk twice and they sent someone twice. Still, the door was not fixed properly. Breakfast was included in my rate. Overall, if you are strong enough to open rough-running doors, you have a good location at a resonable price.

Had some problems, but was able to deal. Fastforward to now. It's dirty. It's been poorly-maintained. And we've had nothing but problems. I'm sharing a 2-twin bedroom with a colleague. It's a tight fit, which might be tolerable if we could actually get some HOUSEKEEPING. We returned to our room after the first night, to find that they hadn't bothered coming around. At first I assumed this was a mix up due to our room change (they initially put us on the 3rd floor, where you inexplicably can't get the hotel's wifi signal). I was able to get clean towels and soap from the front desk, but it was too late in the day to receive a proper cleaning. But alas, TWO days in a row now, we have failed to receive housekeeping. I left the room over the noonhour, and the maid was working on the room next to ours. She saw me walk out, and remove the \"do not disturb\" sign from the door. Logic would dictate that she'd then clean our room. Nope! When I called down to complain upon my return, I was told that it's POLICY to not do this. When the housekeeping staff passes by a door with a do not disturb sign, their policy is to bypass it and NOT return. Are you kidding me? The beds are all undone, the remaining coffee in the pot from day one is threatening to develop self-awareness, and the shower - which drips incontrollably and splashes onto the bathroom floor - has created an en suite waterpark. Not the type of amenity I was looking for. I received a call back from the front desk, offering to send someone up to empty the now-overflowing garbage can (we've been living on take-out food), and leave us new towels. I accepted the offer, but it never happened. Also, I seem to remember the continental breakfast not sucking so bad back then. You have your choice of carbs, carbs, carbs, and maybe a sad-looking slice of watermelon if you're fast enough. The kicker? I paid more than double what I paid for the room 2 years ago.

When we bought it, we were told it was for 5 nights, with all amenities and parking included by the company we bought it from. When we arrived on the Saturday(25th of Sept.), immediately we were told we'd have to pay for parking. After trying to explain that we had booked the stay weeks prior and were assured that parking was included in this 'charitable' purchase, my wife ended up having to spend 45 minutes explaining our case to Delphine who told her that we weren't even supposed to be inpossession of this package and that it had been given to a company for their use. Nevertheless, after almost an hour, the parking was deleted and my wife kept being asked who we bought it from. We didn't remember and were also pestered about it when we checked out at which time they \"got us back\" by charging us for the fridge, something we need due my medication and were also told was covered with the 'package' when my wife phoned to confirm a fridge was available. We just paid for it as we were tired of answering questions about where we got the package and who sold it and what was covered and what wasn't, but in my opinion, Travelodge owes me $50 for a fridge that had a poor seal and a freezer so packed with undefrosted ice that we couldn't put more than 2 popsicles in it. Having said that. The hotel's rooms are pathetically small, but what does one go to a hotel for? To sleep and shower. But the rooms are not made for anyone over 5'7\" - 5' 9\" as everything is in such close proximity that it's impossible to leave there without having your shins smashed on the solid wooden bedframe(that's right, no boxspring). The bathroom measures about 4 feet deep by 6 feet long and the shower is basically a basin with a curtain and two cheap plastics strips that do a poor job of keeping the water inside the shower. If this is \"European Style\" then I'm glad I don't travel to Europe very often, yet I haven't seen any European rooms as yet that match the puny outlay of these ones. It's a place to sleep and wash but that's it. The lobby has NOTHING except an overpriced souvenir shop and a few places to sit. They do provide free newspapers, but I had to go down from the top floor to get mine after being told they would be delivered to our door, which never happened once. On the first night(Sun. 26th), I woke up at 2 am(as I always do wherever I sleep) and decided to go downstairs for a walk. In the hallway, there was a man sleeping on the floor right by our room. I called the desk and reported it as I was afraid for my wife's well-being and the other guests. I was assured someone would be right up. I went downstairs and around 3:30 went back upstairs. The man was still there. I phoned the desk again and again was told it would be looked after. I fell asleep until 5:30 and woke up at which time I checked the hall again. The man was STILL there! So I woke him to see if he was ok. He was just a homeless fellow, but I told him he'd better get out before the cops got called, so I escorted him to the elevator and pushed the button for the bottom floor. I should have given him one of the hotel's blankets and pillows because an hour later I went to go down to go get coffees and he was sleeping in the elevator. So I(YES, ME) rode the elevator downstairs with him and led him out the front doors. Is this MY JOB? My wife and I and all the guests have the right to think that the hotel staff will do their jobs to see that we're safe when on their property and I confronted the front desk about this. Not the start to our 5 day vacation on our first trip to Montreal I was expecting. The staff was pretty nice overall, especially the Cuban fellow(forget his name) and other than the nitpicking about the parking and fridge, it was a friendly and helpful staff. **SUGGESTION: Change the carpet in the elevators for the love of God. It stinks like urine and mold in all the cars and is LONG OVERDUE for a change. At least steam them and put strong odor destroyer down because they smell that bad. The rest of the hotel is clean and the lady on the 11th floor cleaning staff was excellent and very friendly. **SUGGESTION: Either get some boxsprings or add sleep padding on the beds as by the time my 5 days were up, my hips and back were so sore I could barely walk. If you're there for 1 or 2 nights, it will suffice. For longer stays, go elsewhere. The pillows are flatter than pancakes and even 2 extra ones barely make one pillow. **Breakfast: It's your very basic \"continental breakfast\". **SUGGESTION: One kind of bagel, no healthy cereal choices such as granola or oats but they did have Cheerios along with fruit loops and rice krispies. The coffee is bitter and needs to be improved. And would it kill them to offer yogurt or waffles? Two kinds of muffins, same everyday. On the last morning we were there they provided bananas but they were gone so fast I just about had to wrestle with an angry frenchman who was trying to take the last three for himself. Overall, this place is good for a one or two night stopover, nothing more as there are no amenities worth mentioning. Not even so much as a television in the lobby for latenighters like myself who can't sleep. I have a very hard time recommending this place to anyone except for the fact that it wasn't nearly as bad as some of the reviews suggest and the staff was quite fine in their capacities, other than the pestering about how and where we got the rooms on Ebay. And the location to Old Montreal, the transit system, and many attractions is excellent.

The rooms are small (like a European hotel) and while generally clean the hotel is looking somewhat aged with stains and wear on the carpet in both the hall and rooms. Beds were clean and comfortable but when servicing the room the hotel had missed some plastic rubbish from prvious patrons. There are three lifts, and during the morning breakfast period there could be quite a wait. Irons and ironing boards are not provided in the rooms but are available from the check in desk. A complimentary continental style breakfast is included in the room price. The website describes this as a \"deluxe\" continental buffet breakfast, but it is limited to cereal, bread items (croissants, bagels, muffins and toast) and fruit - several European hotels I have stayed in have offered cheese, ham and sometimes eggs as well as the bread items, so for a \"deluxe\" breakfast was expecting a little more. There is a gift shop near the lobby selling a good range of souvenirs and stamps, and vending machines on the Mezzaine floor. Complimentary newspapers are available from the lobby.

She was better than this lady. While I was talking to this supervisor, she spoke to another girl in a threatening voice about me. By hearing this I told the supervisor that I'm withdrawing my complaints. I didn't have any option. I was afraid, she may do some thing against us during our stay there. About the room, it was a small cattle shed. No internet and no connection to outside in this advanced world of technology. The supervisor told me that this is European style. I lived in many hotels in different countries. Amercas, Europe, Asia, Middle east.... Never seen this kind of room. For all reviews, the management is giving a very good explanation. If you visit the hotel website, you can watch beautiful pictures of luxury rooms. This may be from a different hotel or otherwise the Manager's room itself.

Reserved one room at the nightly rate of $119 CAD. I booked my room on the hotel's website. A few days later, I got a call from the manager as he had noticed I was one person staying in a room with a single and a bunk bed. (It was the cheapest room available.) He offered to switch me to a room with two single beds at the same rate, and I was fine with that. At check-in, I asked if there was any space in their parking garage for my car, and there wasn't. Instead, I parked underground across the street at the Complexe Guy-Favreau (entrance on Rue St-Urbain), a federal government building, for $16/day. I got to my room (518) and was ready for the worst after seeing other reviews and photos. Sure enough, I got a small room with two single beds (not side-by-side, but in an L-formation), a small desk and a flat screen TV mounted on the wall. All bedding and draperies seemed dated. Also, there was no closet but simply a small rack with hangers near the window. As for the bathroom, it was as small as advertised. There was barely any room near the toilet seat, and the sink didn't have a plunger (working or otherwise). As for the shower, it reminded me of a phone booth. It measures about 3' by 3' in a pentagon shape, and anyone tall would have difficulty getting clean. The one positive thing about the hotel was the complimentary continental breakfast offered every morning. It is served in a large dining area on the mezzanine level, and the food selection is quite enormous. I stuck with fruit and yogurt, but there were several types of pastries, cereal, boiled eggs, coffee and juices available. I chose the hotel because my first choice (the Holiday Inn Select) was sold out. The Travelodge is just around the corner from Chinatown, which was the main reason for my stay. It was also convenient to have an IGA supermarket across the street (corner of Ren\u00c3\u00a9-Levesque and St-Urbain, inside the Complexe Desjardins). A few blocks south is the Notre-Dame Basilica and Old Montreal. This hotel was the first Travelodge to be opened in North America and sadly, it has not aged well.

I am typically a low-maintenance guy when it comes to hotels. I rarely ask the front desk for anything. However, the few times that I have had to deal with the front desk staff, the experience was terrible. The people they have at the front desk at night, in particular, are argumentative, unhelpful and tend to blame any problems on the guests. An example: there is no restaurant in the hotel (there is a continental breakfast, more on that later) and the neighborhood is not a place you want to roam at night. For your late night snack or soda cravings there are three vending machines (over-priced, but I expect that). Anyway, I asked the front desk staff to break a 5 dollar bill as the vending machines take only change. No luck. In fact, the guy at the desk offered to give me the 4 dollars in change he had in his pocket for my 5. Huh?! Oh, and I interrupted him having a long, loud argument with another guest who was fed up with the terrible service and trying to cancel the rest of his stay. So, he points me down the street and says there's a store at the corner that's open. I wasted half an hour looking for this place on the corner. Never found it. Another example: I needed to get some laundry sent out. I asked for a second laundry bag which the front desk staff gave me. When I came back down with my dirty laundry in two bags, they wanted me to re-sort it *in public*(!) in the lobby because it was apparently my fault there was only one laundry form in my room. They needed two - one for each bag. You'd think they would have thought of that when they gave me the 2nd bag. On top of that, they couldn't find any more forms at the front desk. They ended up taking my single form and photocopying it. The odd thing is that the front desk staff during the day seem quite nice and helpful. So, I'll echo what others have already mentioned. Yes, the continental breakfast is pathetic. Doughy croissants and fruit cocktail. Yuck! The shower will not stop dripping. The A/C in my room was marginal. It was usually warmer and more humid in my room than either outside or in the hallway. What was decent? Well, the wireless internet in the room worked fine for me. I liked the guy who ran the \"souvenir shop\" in the lobby (open only at bizarre and unpredictable hours, however). The day staff at the front desk were helpful in getting my shuttle back to the airport and in correcting a few minor maintenance issues (a bulb burned out, my telephone stopped working). The cleaning staff also were fine. I would gladly have paid more (significantly more) had there been another option for the conference I was attending.

The breakfast was very ordinary and the lack of any other catering facilities...i.e cafe or room service ...meant that in the middle of winter you had to bundle up and head to a restaurant every night. There are no bar fridges so forget self catering. Lack of laundromat meant another long hike up to the village to do laundry. I think if a hotel is going to be low budget then it should cater for budget travellers with washing facilities and some self catering in the room, especially if no other food service is available.

We did request a room with two twin beds and the bunk beds for an \"inexpensive\" family trip but this was totally ridiculous! There was no room to actually \"sit\" on the bottom beds without hitting your heads on the \"bunk beds\" (which were two single beds attached to the wall, not a bunk bed that I've ever seen in my life. The room was so small we were worried that we wouldn't be able to fit through the door, never mind four of us staying there for two nights comfortably. I will say though, that the shower in the bathroom had good running water. It's just too bad that the drain was about 1hr behind in getting rid of the water. There were no screens in the windows - which isn't necessarily a big deal if you don't have small children with you. The heater/air conditioner kept blowing cold air out, no matter how high we set the temperature. The photo shown on the Travelodge site was NOTHING compared to what we received upon arrival. Breakfast - that's another story altogether. The \"french\" bread was hard as a rock, the \"orange\" juice should have been called coloured water. The croissants were stale. The fruit salad was mostly leftovers from the night before it looked. The only decent thing we found to eat was bread (which had been sitting out for who knows how long) that we toasted. Also, having someone watching you constantly while you're eating tends to turn some people off. The ultimate insult was actually watching one of the employees sneeze about three times in his hands and then just wipe his hands on his jeans - THEN continue with putting placemats and cutlery out on the tables. Then, to keep the excitement going, he's clearing his nose as he's walking by those patrons that are eating - totally disgusting if I do say so myself.

I came onto this website and was reading all the other reviews and couldnt understand why my brother would recommend this hotel when every one else is not recommending it. I trusted him so I booked the hotel for a weekend in June. We arrived about 7pm and check in went very well. There are a two things that I did not know until I arrived and that was parking is 14.95 a night & they need a $50 room deposit. You park right underground of the hotel and there are elevators to take you straight up to your room. We were on a smoking floor but suprisingly it did not smell like cigarettes at all. Our room was a tad bit small, but comfortable for two people. The room was equipped with everything you needed such as coffee maker, wireless internet, AC, & even a LCD television. The bathroom only has a shower stall and no bathtub, so if you need a bathtub then this wouldnt be the place for you. When we arrived our AC did not work, but was fixed within 10 minutes of asking the front desk about it. The gift shop in the hotel can change your money for you, and even when it was closed the front desk had no problem doing it. We had no problems checking out and our car was very safe in the underground parking area. (you can only get into the parking if you had paid for it and you have to slide your room key to open the garage door) The travelodge hotel was located right in downtown montreal, i dont think we could have gotten a hotel in a better location. The next block over is China Town with a lot of neat shops and Ste. Catherins street is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. I would strongly recommend this hotel to travelers who want to be close to everything and be within walking distance to all the bars & shops.

Despite repeated pleas, I kept hearing 'We don't have any other option. If you don't want it, go somewhere else. We are overbooked'. Finally after 20 minutes of this, they finally talked to the manager and found me a non-smoking room! While I was waiting, I saw another individual with a daughter in a wheelchair complaining about the non-handicapped room that she was assigned (despite specifically booking a handicapped room). Again the front desk agent kept saying they can't do anything about it. Finally they had to go to another hotel!! When I went to the room, the keys didn't work. Why? Because there was already somebody in that room. Apparently they had forgotten to check that person into the room! So I had to truck back down with my luggage and wait another 20 mins to get another room. During this time, the front desk clerk did not speak to me once (ie no apologies, nothing.. she wordlessly handed me the new keys). Check out: Apparently this hotel doesn't do pre-paid departures (ie clear bill day prior to departure) as I was told that I can only check out as I clear the room. So then I asked for late checkout (1pm instead of noon). Again I was told NO and only offered 12:30. Size of Room/Bathroom: Very small with little room to even spread out our luggage. Breakfast: It was ok with croissants, juice, cereal, toast and coffee. Location: It is a good location, but I would pay more for a nearby hotel (Holiday Inn, Mariott) to get better customer service.

I have been brooding about it ever since and am very happy to be able to warn other people about this hotel. Online I was given a confirmation number for 2 adults and 1 child for the weekend. I booked a room with a double bed and a cot was to be included at arrival. I printed off the confirmation page and was confident that everything was in order since I have used Travelodge many times. It was just important to have the confirmation number (as I have found out from other bookings over the phone, internet etc.). So we arrived at 5:30 pm on Friday to find a large parade was going on in front of the hotel. Apparently, our room was given away from the walk in traffic and we were given a room with two twin beds and a bunk bed!! The room was literally not big enough to hold our luggage, my golf bag and the three of us standing. When we complained, the front desk said that the paper we presented did not say we wanted a double bed. If I had more confidence in my fellow man I would have included the confirmation e-mail in this note, which states that I had indeed booked a double room. When I complained to corporate Travelodge, they said they could do little to help me because these people were franchisees. It gets better!! Didn't I get another invitation from Travelodge to stay at one of their hotels/motels in Saint Sauveur. It's weird that we got an invitation from that \"franchisee\" because our stay in Saint Sauveur was only one night. It was a short stay there because they were remodelling and there were holes in the shell of the building. It didn't help that it was about forty below zero outside. We arrived there late and couldn't get another room so we opened up the electric oven and turned that on full to get warm enough. Needless to say, we haven't stayed at another Travelodge. We have requested that Travelodge not contact us in any fashion (and they have complied). I am not a snob or anything and can tell everybody that I regularly travel to northern Ontario where there really aren't any Ritz Carltons.

At the risk of sounding like Paul Giamatti? in the movie \"Duets,\" all you want is a little respect!!

CLEANLINESS The lobby and the common areas were clean. The rooms were pretty clean as well. Unfortunately, I received a smoking room. I woke up in the morning reaking of tobacco, and it tasted like a smoked a whole pack too! COMFORT Bed was comfortable, as was the furniture. The bathroom was small, and the shower tucked into the corner, with flimsy shower flaps. Yes, flaps. They sure weren't walls. Oh, and a shower curtain. I couldn't turn around easily in the shower, and I'm not exactly a big or fat guy. There is a very small coffee maker in the room, too. SERVICE When I arrived I was checked in quickly. Unfortunately, I was told parking was full, and the clerk at the front desk told me about some dodgy-looking parking lots in the area, that required me to get up early to pay the attendent to avoid a charge or a tow! I drove around and parked at the Place-Desjardin 100m west of the hotel in a wonderful lot. That lot was expensive, $19.00 for 12 hours. OUCH. The next morning we went for the complimentary continental breakfasts. They left a card in the room. We had two people in the room. We went down to the restaurant to explain, but my friend noticed a sign on the door that said \"2 eggs, bacon, sausages, toast - $7.00). When we told the guy at the door that we only had one continental breakfast ticket, and he said it would be $7.00 for my friend. Fine, $7.00 for a nice breakfast, not the complimentary one. Boy, was he wrong. The $7.00 was for access to the rubbish complimentary breakfast, and if he wanted the bacon and eggs, it would cost an additional $7.00. Speaking of the complimentary breakfast, the crossaints were oily, the orange juice was overly-acidic (probably from concentrate), the bowls for cereal were ridiculously small, the fruit medley was awful and bland, and the muffins were tiny and very dry. Overall, the food was poor quality. The only good things were the coffee and tea, which are pretty hard to screw up. I would recommend not even wasting time on the restraunt on the premises, and go to Chez Cora at 1017 Ste-Catherine est. You have to pay, but it is fantastic.
