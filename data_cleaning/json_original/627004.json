The location of the Breakers Hotel was great because we were right on the boardwalk. Once you were on the boardwalk, you were in the middle of the 'boardwalk action'. The amusement park was nearby as well. My husband and I were especially happy with the location. The staff at the Breakers was excellent. Since this was our first time in Ocean City, we were not familiar with restaurants, activities, etc. The front desk staff helped us with our plans and really recommended some wonderful places; Bahama Mamas's for some crabs, Shannigan's for lunch, Fager's for dinner. On the night of our anniversary, after coming back from a great dinner/time at Fager's, the staff left us some delicious chocolate covered strawberries in our frig for our anniversary! We were touched by the thoughtfulness. Thank you Breakers for making our first anniversary great and memorable.

We love staying at Breakers. We had an ocean front room ( suite) and the view is amazing! We have stayed here several times. We go to Ocean City every year and try to book this hotel every year because it is clean, the rooms have so much space and the location is perfect! The beds were very comfortable, nice sitting area, and they have a microwave and mini fridge and a sink. The bathroom is ok, nothing spectacular but nice enough. Would have been nice to have a full length mirror like a lot of hotels.You don't feel crowed at all in this suite. Although we have never stayed in a room other than the ocean front, I would imagine that all rooms would be nice here. It is located right above the dough roller resturant which is perfect when you get hungry late at night! YUM!!! Its not far from the amusment park and short walk to great resturants on the boardwalk. The staff was friendly at the desk . (which has not always been the case) But the last couple of years they have been great! They have strict rules here but that is what keeps it very nice and safe as well. ( such as for an example, you need a room key to get up to the floors) We enjoy it here and can't wait to go back again next year! They are pricy but again, we feel it is worth paying more because it is so nice and also clean. Some hotels on the boardwalk are not like that. You don't have to get ocean front room to save money. They have standard rooms which have a window ( it doesn't open though) that faces the side and looks at another building with no ocean view if you wanted. Over all, we would be sure to recommend this lovely hotel. If you do however want an ocean front room, they only have 9 rooms so you should book early.

Carpet had several noticable tears and worn spots. Hole in bathroom wall. Vanity mirror didn't light. Our card for entry in the room stopped working twice during our three day stay and we had to go to the desk for them to reactivate. Also second day of our stay the maid service skipped our room and when we came back at 530pm we had to call down and asked for it to be cleaned. No explanation given on why it was skipped. I think for the price of these rooms ($369 per day) updates need to start happening soon. Don't think I would stay here again.

Well...not totally. At check in we had requested an oceanview room on a high floor. When my fianc\u00e9' checked in, she was told we were on the third floor - the first level of rooms - not high at all! When she asked for a higher floor, she was told, there were no rooms on higher floors available and came to get me with the bags and the key to the 3rd floor room. We went up to the room, and found it to be so low that all you could see off the balcony were buildings. If you leaned way over the balcony you could see a small piece of the beach. Be warned! This is considered oceanview! Not the view I expected so I insisted we go back to the clerk and ask for another room. Miraculously, a room on a higher floor was found! So after looking at the room on the 5th floor, we changed rooms. Although, we still had to look over the balcony to see the ocean, it was a better view of the ocean. However, either way, you have to lean over the balcony to see the oceanview. You can also see part of the bay. After our first night, the hotel's hot water wasn't working throughout the hotel. We were told this was the first time that had ever happened and it was repaired by the following morning. The cold shower the first morning was not pleasant! BRRRR! The front desk workers were pleasant and apologetic for the problems we encountered. The room was clean, the air conditioner is self regulated (which is always a plus), and the room contains both a refrigerator and a microwave. We had to call the front desk twice, however- once, because housekeeping did not clean the tub, and second because there was no hotel information book in the room. Housekeeping came back immediately to take care of the matter and someone from the check-in desk came upstairs to bring us the book. Now to the good part...EXCELLENT location right on the board walk. A few doors down from Thrashers and 4 -5 blocks from the amusement park, you couldn't ask for a better location. Although we had a good, but not great couple of days, we would not stay here again.

We had heard from a family friend that the hotel was one of the cleanest in Ocean City, and was right on the boardwalk. While the hotel was definitely pricey (almost $600 for two nights in a standard room), the boardwalk location and the cleanliness of the hotel could not be beat. However, we were disappointed to find that the staff was very rude, and treated us like we were an inconvenience to them. When we first arrived, the woman who checked us in proceeded to explain the rules about the foot washing station, and handed me the key. She then decided to grab the key out of my hand to replace it with another one! A few minutes later, we found some previous stains (although minor) on the carpet, and went to the lobby to inform the staff that it was not our doing to avoid a charge at the end of the trip. The woman at the desk pretty much ignored us, and treated our concern as if we were foolish and incompetent. Also, later that night we had called down to request a few extra pillows (there were only four pillows in the room, one for each person). The staff at the time told us that we should have had some extra ones in the closet, which we did not. Finally, an attendant came to the door and said that she had one extra pillow- the last one in the entire hotel. We found this to be a little unbelievable, which it was. The next day, I had walked by an open linen closet to see a stack of extra clean pillows! All in all, The Breakers is definitely a clean and convenient hotel.

I havd to add that the friendliness of the remaining staff overcompensated for her lack of congieniality. My daughter wiped out on a wave during our stay and had some pretty good scrapes on her thigh. The staff gave us bandages, gauze and all the fixins to mend her. they also continued to ask about her every day when they saw us. On to the rooms...I think these are the cleanest rooms in OC!!!!! We stayed in the Ocean Front Suite, yes it was the most expensive room there, and likely a bit overpriced conpared to some of the other hotels near by, but our room was spacious. Upon entering the suite, there is a sitting area with a couch w/ a pull out bed. The couch was not confortable, but we neve really used it. A table and four chairs are also in the sitting area. The bathrooms were spacious for a hotel. Not huge, but double sinks, which was nice with kiddos and lots of towles were left everyday, with quality soaps and toiletries. The sleeping area was also spacious and the beds were comfy. I do wish the comforters were a bit fluffier, as i am used to sleeping with a down comforter and the Breaker's were pretty thin. My other and last complaint, although minimal, is that becasue we had glass doors facing the boardwalk, we could hear some noise at night, if peopel were loud. Usually it was no big deal, but one night sone kids were outside beign extremely loud. Did I mention the view...fabulous. I highly recommend this hotel.

The woman at the front desk was rude and did not offer any kind hospitality.

Surely we were welcomed, but rather felt that she were doing us a favor by letting us stay there. The standard room (2 double beds, no view, no balcony) was nicely decorated but not very relaxing. After reading all the rules in the guest services handbook and seeing the warnings regarding particular fines (including a strict no-henna-tattoo policy) the place seemed like a don't-touch museum.

Yes the hotel is clean and the added security of key-access elevators was comforting, but I would not suggest this hotel to anyone I know.

Overall it was a great quality hotel and I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, Very clean\u201d", "Author": "Dacystravels", "ReviewID": "UR18118998", "Content": "For our first family trip to Ocean city we were very pleased. We got to the hotel early, our room wasn't ready until 3 standard. We hit the beach which was steps from the Hotel. When we got our family suite(stayedw-2 adults and 2yr and 5yr old) It was bigger then we expected. The Kids had plenty of room to stretch out in the living room area. Our only complaint was where our room was we heard Delivery trucks every morning and people throwing out trash in the dumpsters at night. Also, they don't have a outdoor pool only inside. I guess that's great with bad weather, but we had perfect sunny days. All and All the place was very clean with updated amenties Shower fixtures, even the toto toliet. I would recommened this place for families and get the family suite.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cWell Maintained\u201d", "Author": "Vacation4usPa", "ReviewID": "UR17065205", "Content": "My family and I just got back from a mini vacation at the Breakers Hotel. We stayed in a standard room, two double beds during the week. It was a little pricey, but considering it's peak season at the beach, that was expected. I read the other reviews and have to say that everyone mentioned the parking situation. Yes, it is not easy to find the entrance to the hotel and the parking is screwy. However, no one gave any advice, so to everyone that is thinking of going here, this is the advise. When you get to third street, turn and drive straight like you were headed to the beach. Look to your right. There is a 20 minute parking sign, park THERE! Then when you get out of your vehicle, the entrance to the lobby is straight behind you. When you go through the doors you can only hit to the second floor because you need a key card to access all other floors! If you remember this, the visit will not be as disappointing. The hotel is clean and well maintained. The housekeeping is friendly and staff is also friendly and helpful. The hotel is right above the Dough Roller that serves excellent breakfast in large portions. The access to the beach was great and an easy walk to all entertainment.

The location is great, being on 3rd and the boardwalk. We had an oceanfront suite, which gave us an incredible view of the ocean. It also gave us a view of the interesting people on the boardwalk, providing us hours of entertainment. The room was extremely clean, and the beds were among the most comfortable I've ever felt in a hotel. Staff was extremely helpful with restaurant tips, bus routes, etc. Be sure to take the bus that goes along Baltimore instead of the boardwalk tram. the bus is $2 for the day and comes every 5-10 minutes. Be sure to check out Seacrets on 42nd for good nightlife. They usually have live music on weekend, with every genre of music you can think of. Assateague Island just south of OC is nice if you want to get away from the crowds. Clean sandy beaches, wild horses, and most of all, quiet. And check out Dough Roller on the 1st level of the Breakers.

We had a standard room because the others were booked. We have already made plans to come back in 2008 and get an upgraded room. It is a great place and location. If you have kids it is great.

I read all the reviews on this hotel on this website and I'm glad I did. We stayed in the oceanview king room and it was definitely what it advertised. The room was clean, the bedding was super comfortable, and the attention to little details made it a great place to sleep. The only difficult part of our stay was actually figuring out where to go in the hotel. It's a little hidden entrance and the parking is down the next street but we arrived at night so I definitely suggest arriving during the day. We pool was very nice as well....it was indoor and the room heated so very refreshing when we needed something other than salt water. I was worried about the noise level but we both slept the best we ever had in a hotel. The convience to the beginning of the boardwalk and food was perfect.
