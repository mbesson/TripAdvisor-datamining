The location is great, on Rue Saint-Denis there are many bakeries, restaurants and bars that you can choose from. The room was a fair size with kitchen facilities, which were not the cleanest. It appeared that the glasses that were placed in our room were reused and were not cleaned. I used a glass on my first night and the following day after the room was cleaned, the same glass was on the table. I knew it was the same one as my lipstick from the day before was imprinted on the rim. Upon arriving, we called to order lunch, they had advised that the kitchen is closed, the following morning we heard the same excuse, and lastly the morning of our departure the same excuse was told again. Yes, there were restaurants closeby that my boyfriend and I could have gone to but when you're in the mood to dine-in it is kind of a let down.

It's a small, boutique style hotel, but you wouldn't know that by looking at the rooms. They are enormous and have every amenity you could think of. Between the gigantic bathtub, the fully stocked kitchen (microwave, fridge, stove, pots, pans, utensils, etc.) dining nook, and comfy bed, I barely wanted to leave the room at all. It was wonderful waking up and being able to make delicious espresso in the Keruig style espresso machine in the room. Everything we needed was available to us. We forgot toothpaste, but were thrilled to find individually wrapped toothbrushes and toothpastes waiting for us in the bathroom. And enjoying a bottle of wine was easy with a wine opener and set of wine glasses right there in the room. There was even a lovely little balcony, although it was a bit too cold too enjoy this time of year. For a hundred dollars a night, I can't believe how luxurious the room was. I kept telling my fiance, why would anyone want to stay anywhere else? The hotel is situated on a street full of shops and restaurants, and very close to the metro, so getting around is a breeze and there is plenty to explore. After walking around all day it was a wonderful place to come back to and relax. We didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant attached to the hotel, but it seemed like a nice place. The valet parking was 15 dollars a day which I thought was pretty reasonable, and the staff was very friendly.

People always mistakenly book with the national outfits like W, The Fairmont, Sheraton, and Delta because its like going to McDonalds - you know the price and what to expect and ultimately are disapointed - but to all travelers, I want to strongly recommend Hotel Kutuma. It is the best located hotel in all of Montreal - on famed St. Denis Street, in the heart of Plateau and walking distance to all the chic restaurants, bars, cafes, clubs, lounges. The rooms are so beautifully decorated. Each room has extras, and amenities that are a travelers dream (they actually have good espresso coffee machines in each room). The price point is more competitive vs. the national outfits. The staff are unbelievable... at your beck and call... no matter what the request or what time it is. Because of its smaller size, and boutique feel, you are treated like not only the most important guest, but like royalty.

Overall our experience was good, but we would not recommend the hotel for those with babies or small children. The location is excellent - far enough up St. Denis to avoid the noise but close enough to walk both there as well as in the other direction to less crowded restaurants and shops. Checking in and out: this is quite simply awkward. Here's where the quirky part comes in :). While the service is very good, if you have a baby or small children and a lot of stuff, you have to unload it on the curb, get it into a micro-sized lobby, and then take it up stairs (no elevator). If you are just on your own it is probably fine, but the stairs were hard with a baby (long flight to get up and down), especially with a buggy (which they were happy to store for us, but imagine having to call the front desk for your buggy every time you step out of the hotel). Also, you have to use the valet service, as there's nowhere to park, and this can take a long time. Service was very inconsistent with this, which is a pain. Lastly, when we checked out, they gave us no receipt! My husband didn't realize that I needed this for my company reimbursement, so I emailed them for one later. When it came it was not itemized! Just a total with tax broken down - very inconvenient, and I think unprofessionaly (and hard for reimbursement purposes). Room: much smaller than the website suggests. Having not been in Montreal for over 10 years, I cannot comment on comparables, but this felt like Manhattan sizes. You know those cool, slightly more affordable hotels in Manhattan where they suspend the TV from the ceiling because of no space? It was minimally better than that. Having said that, they did manage to squeeze in the necessities - comfortable king bed, nice living area, interesting and cute furnishings in the African theme, and lovely bathroom with gorgeous jetted tub and shower. The only peculiarity was that the kitchenette was made from cheap IKEA stuff you'd see in a dorm room. No biggie, but not what I'd expect in a hotel. Food: we love Ethiopian, but just due to circumstances we did not actually eat it while there in their restaurant. We did, however, order their breakfast and it was excellent. TIP: great for two, so you might want to order one breakie and share. Service: except for the valet delay and the lack of receipt, everyone was extremely helpful and courteous, and we experienced very good service. Summary: If I did not have a child I'd return, but I'd want to check out comparables before committing to that. According to many, accomodations in Montreal have slipped quite a bit in the last 10-20 years, so maybe this is much better for the money than I am reporting.

We definitely made the best of our little dining room, which, with its pre-set table and candles, was lovely and romantic. The Kutuma offers the best of both worlds: good facilities for doing self-catering, and a top location if you fancy a short stroll to eat out. There was an array of wonderful looking eateries -and a nice bakery- within 100 metres, not to mention the Ethiopian restaurant downstairs, at which we enjoyed a really tasty and different meal. The staff at the Kutuma were so accommodating and, from whisking our far-too-heavy suitcases upstairs with a flourish on day one, looked after us brilliantly (even popping up to our room discreetly to leave a lovely dessert when we couldn't manage one in the restaurant!). My partner and I said we would recommend this place to everyone and certainly return there ourselves should we ever be lucky enough to revisit Montreal.

The kitchenette was really more of a full kitchen with a full sized refrigerator and was ideal for preparing early morning/or late morning breakfasts and late night snacks or drinks. The hotel has a wonderful Ethiopian food restaurant on the first floor (to go with it's Ethiopian themed decor!). Having never experienced Ethiopian food before, it was quite phenomenal, especially after a 7+ hour drive to Montreal! I chose to have valet service because I did bring my car, the staff took good care of it as parking can be difficult on St. Denis, and it really made a difference not having to struggle to find a parking spot especially in a city that is not my own. The rooms were clean, and as mentioned before - Ethiopian themed. The linens were changed daily and bathroom toiletries restocked as well. The only areas of improvement for the rooms would be the minimal space in which to store packed items (only one closet and no drawers), but there was plenty of room for my suitcase. The TV was rather small and I was not able to order any movies, but that was a good thing because there was plenty to do and plenty to see in walking distance in such a good area of St. Denis street. This hotel was an ideal location for a leisure trip to Montreal, I was close to great nightlife, food, and shopping.

This was classified as their \"Superior Queen\" room, the smallest option since I was traveling by myself. Here is an objective list of items (both good and bad) I wish I'd known before booking this room: (1) NOISE ISSUES. The hotel has 4 floors of rooms, and room 302 is on the 3rd (not top) floor. I could hear every footstep of the party above me, particularly when they came home at 2am. Mind you, these people weren't partying and jumping. Just walking around getting ready for bed. It was loud enough to disturb my sleep and I didn't care for it at all. I could also hear the people in room 301 adjacent to me. There must have been a closet door on the shared wall between our rooms because they would slam it and it would shake my bed. I actually scooted my bed away from the wall to try to not be disturbed by it. I requested to be moved to a room on the top floor but unfortunately they were booked solid during my stay. I absolutely wouldn't stay at this hotel again unless they could guarantee me a room on the top floor and then the sound between adjacent rooms would be a crap shoot at that point. (2) AIRPORT SHUTTLE. They offer a courtesy shuttle to the airport. I didn't know this until I was checking out and asked them to call me a cab. They said their shuttle had just left and the next one wouldn't be for 2 hours. He scolded me for not reserving the shuttle 24 hours in advance. How the heck do you schedule something you don't know exists? That really irked me as I wasted a lot of money on cab rides to/from the airport. Very frustrating, especially since I was cranky from lack of sleep due to overhead footstep noise. (3) SHABBY ROOMS. The rooms are a bit shabby. Nobody seems to mention that in their reviews. This hotel is priced accordingly so I wasn't too disappointed, but they show their wear and tear. I definitely wouldn't book this place for a romantic weekend. It's just not up to that caliber. But for a convenient place to stay, then probably. (4) COFFEE STATION. The kitchenette in my room had both a drip coffee pot and an espresso machine. The hotel provided coffee, although I had to ask the maid service to refill the espresso coffee for me as they didn't do it otherwise. The espresso machine only worked half the time I tried, but when it did it was nice to have. (5) DARK ROOM. My room faced a fire escape away from the street side, so upon first entering, I thought it didn't have any windows at all. Upon closer inspection, there was a tiny window in the kitchenette area that had a blackout blind on it, and the bathroom had a much larger window for light. So it felt a bit like staying in a dungeon, but the upside was that the room was extremely dark at night which aided in sleeping (when people weren't walking overhead or slamming doors). Overall, I'll be shopping for an alternate place to stay the next time I visit Montreal. All the noise that carries through the walls and floors made it feel like staying in a tenement.", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kingston, ontario", "Title": "\u201cA low key gem\u201d", "Author": "wombat23", "ReviewID": "UR65227562", "Content": "I chose Kutuma for an anniversary weekend away. We are fans of value, independence and quirky charm, and it had been over 97 months since my wife and I had spent a night without a child under the same roof, so I wanted something luxurious that also fit our tastes. Hotel Kutuma delivered in almost all ways, and I have debated 5 or 4 stars, leaning finally to the former because the excellent service made up for any technical deficiencies. Those deficiencies included an espresso machine that did not work (and they knew this but left it in room to my chagrin after mucking about for 1/2 an hour) and small items on room makeup. The website shows off the high end rooms, so our Junior Suite was initially a slight disappointment for me. But my (design-oriented) partner immediately loved it and I realized I had scored: The room was very nice and well worth the price. The location is great and the staff were really efficient and friendly. We ate in the hotel's Nil Bleu Ethiopian restaurant one of our nights and enjoyed our meal thoroughly. Recognizing us as guests (?) they even sent some complimentary dessert and coffee, even though the restaurant was thronging and we had no reservations.

Honestly, wow! My husband and I stayed in Kutuma just last month and we were so very pleased. It's not often that you get to really enjoy what it feels like to be welcomed somewhere ( when traveling) with true care and concern of your well being and enjoyment. Kutuma is a little jewel of a hotel that is located on one of the THE best streets in Montreal ( Rue St. Denis). You have everything you could need at your doorstep - - such a quaint little park next door and the metro two blocks over plus wonderful shops, restaurants and beautiful streets. The best, most outstanding highlights of Kutuma: The Staff: they greet you at the door and carry your bags up to your room, they are very personable and will go to very far extremes to help you with your stay. On leaving the hotel, the owner personally packed our car with our luggage in the pouring rain! The Hotel: Kutuma has a very unique style. Our room was a junior suite - - honestly, it was the most comfortable stay I've ever spent in a hotel. The bed was FANTASTIC! The bathroom ( shower! ) was very unique in style. We had our own little kitchenette and sitting area, as well. The touches that were put in to the room made it a very memorable stay. Also, you could hear no one! The hotel must be built very soundly - - it was like you were in your own little cocoon. Adjoining restaurant: Kutama has it's own restaurant ( The Blue Nile). The Blue Nile was our first dining experience in Montreal and we were not disappointed! It had a very chic atmosphere/ambiance with a cool, elegant style. The food is Ethiopian and it was delicious! The prices were reasonable and the service was impeccable! One more personal note that I'd like to add - - there was an unfortunate event that took place when we stayed in Montreal. Two doors down from Kutuma ( second nite of our stay) there was a fire that destroyed one and a half buildings. We found this fire around 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday nite. Kutuma was not available to us ( roped off by police/fire emergency crew). We were very worried about our well being, the hotel's and our belongings. The nite wore on without any information on what to do and where to stay. Around 11:00 p.m., one of the staff from the hotel saw us in the street and told us to join them at a neighboring restaurant. The owner of the hotel had sent his staff out in to the streets to try to find/locate people that were staying at Kutuma. The owner paid for us to stay in a 5 star hotel for the evening. He, himself, escorted us to the hotel at 12:00 a.m. to make sure the we were safe and sound in our one night stay. WOW.

I then had the opportunity to see the larger rooms, and was even more amazed by the space and layout. Standards exist in every aspect, beginning with the thoughtfulness and warm hospitality of the owner, Abby. From offering coffee, an umbrella, or assistance with luggage, Abby extends himself with professionalism and kindness. Standards continue with the highest level of cleanliness, safety , and customer care. I had never eaten Ethiopian food, and am so happy I had dinner at the adjoining hotel. The vegetarian combination platter was amazing!. This continued with the complimentary delicious breakfast of fresh fruit, organic eggs, potatoes and vegetables, and freshly brewed ginger tea.

When we called to reserve a few months ahead of time, they told us they would upgrade us if there was anything available. When we got there, they had upgraded us from a junior suite to the deluxe penthouse suite. Every part of our room was gorgeous, from the elephant table in the kitchen to the huge jacuzzi tub. The bed was huge, and was the most comfortable bed I have slept on in my life. I have a lot of trouble getting a good, full night's sleep, and I had no problem during our stay.

The linens were great the room had a kitchen and the bathroom was really really nice. Also every single light in the place had a dim switch on it. The first person we met when we checked in was Abbi. He insisted on helping us with our bags, parked our car for us and offered us something to drink. We modestly said water would be nice, but maybe two minutes later he showed up at our door with mango/papaya/coconut drinks. It was amazing! Abbi was so friendly and eager to help and it seemed like he was working every morning and night that were there. I would definately recomend this place and have to family and friends.

Especially in the off-season, when it is barely over 100USD/night for a standard room, this hotel was a great value. It's definitely a \"boutique\" hotel in the truest sense of the word -- it's a very small operation, often with only one person manning the (very tiny) front desk. It's probably not the ideal place for travelers who put a lot of demands on hotel staff (or have an aversion to stairs -- there's no elevator). But if you're looking for a quiet, elegant, clean, and extremely convenient place to spend your nights in the city, you could scarecely do better. The halls and stairway are nicely appointed, and the room (i got the basic queen) was HUGE. In addition to the wonderfully appointed bed (especially loved the faux fur throw), the main area is set up like a studio apartment, complete with a dining area set for two (very nice settings, by the way), a huge wardrobe, and a full kitchenette with sink, stovetop, toaster, and mini-fridge. The room I had was lacking in all but a couple tiny windows facing the back -- perhaps I would have minded in spring, but I didn't even notice it during my stay. The bathroom sometimes felt a little bit too trendy for its own good functioning, but had one huge plus for it -- a giant, deep, two-person soaking tub. The faucet and showerhead could have used some higher pressure (and really, the showerhead and lack of curtain/shower area made it inadequate for showering), but oh... once i got the tub filled, the candles lit, it was like a little spa. I originally planned on going out dancing on my second night there, but instead wound up going to the best sleep I had in weeks after ordering some excellent ethiopian food from the restaurant downstairs, chocolate cake, followed by a long soak in the tub while finishing a bottle of wine! I never had any problems with noise, and the staff was eager to help when needed (though I didn't have much in the way of requests other than the meal, and figuring out how to use the climate control). The hotel is located about halfway up the Rue St Denis, which is a major strip of restaurants, stores, and boutiques, and makes for a nice stroll to any of the adjoining neighborhoods. Metro access is fairly close, though travelers with a poor sense of direction might get turned around the first time or two.
