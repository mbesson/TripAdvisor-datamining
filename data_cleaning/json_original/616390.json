The room was quiet and clean, but nothing fancy. Just beds, a lamp, a dresser and a small TV. No wash cloths or face towels are provided - only large towels. Was a little alarmed that there was no deadbolt or chain on the door. I asked the lady at the front desk about this, and she stated that none of the rooms had security chains. I didn't really mind the fact that I had to borrow a hair dryer and iron from the front desk. I also didn't really mind wearing that \"mandatory\" paper security bracelet. My problem was that I had NO HOT WATER either night. The woman at the front desk told me to let the water run for 10 minutes at a low volume, and then increase it to full volume. Didn't work! Besides, why should a paying customer even have to tinker with the plumbing in the hopes of getting hot water. It should just work. For $30 more dollars a night I could have been at a resort 20 minutes away. I thought about checking out after the first night, but I was with a group and this hotel was very convenient to the site that we were visiting. Also, as someone mentioned, they charge your credit card in full at check-in. I had a strong feeling that I would be given the runaround if I asked for a refund. My stay here was not bad, but not really good... it was just okay. Tolerable. Wouldn't stay here again unless nothing better was available.

The curtains are so flimsy that you wake up at 5:30 AM when the sun comes out.

My only complaint, the accomodations. The hotel seemed clean, but the room furnishings/decorations were sparce. The balcony chairs were dirty, air conditioning loud, hot water non-existent and the shower, although I believe it was clean, looked dirty. Not sure how you can possibly sanitize a tile floor in a shower. I only got 13 channels of \"cable\" of which 6 were English and none of them network stations or even cable news stations. None of the refrigerators are plugged in; so expect to plug in your refrigerator and give it time to cool when you check-in. I was given one hand towel on my first night. The next day there were no face or hand towels, only body towels. When I asked for hand or body towels I was told that there were none. I stated that I had one the day before and was told because of theft, the number was limited. Lesson: bring your own or expect to use body towels for the length of your stay. The room smelled \"stale\" as though no one had stayed there for some time. I will say the restaurant was excellent and during the times the restaurant is not open, there is a local place across the street with good food as well as the town center. Beach is a 5 - 10 walk away and is fantastic! The party room (on the top floor) was great for the wedding and the package my friend got for the wedding was very good (included decorations, a team of people to decorate, hair and makeup for bride and wedding party, food package, honeymoon suite for bride/groom and band). I stayed here for two nights. I wanted to stay at the Aquarius a block or two down the road (and closer to the beach), but thought it would be rude to my friend to stay away from the rest of the wedding party. Overall, the hotel appeared to be clean, and with a little TLC, would feel clean. If you don't plan on spending much time in a hotel room, this place will do for the price.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan", "Title": "\u201cSleeping in a frat House\u201d", "Author": "PaduaSanJuan", "ReviewID": "UR21867664", "Content": "I rented two rooms for my whole family and we could not sleep for the whole weekend. It was like spending a weekend at a frat house. College kids were drinking,screaming, swearing running through the corridor and stairs. I called the front desk thr first night and they did not do anything. The screaming, swearing and running went on until 5am. The next night, the same thing. I called the fonrt desk again. The young man attending the front desks could not control the situation. There was no manager. The front desk clerk had instructions not to wake him up. He refused to call the police. We could not sleep. The next morning still no mananger. Another employee took my complaint and told me they would call me. I have not heard from the hotel. The whole experience was a nightmare!!!!!! A pity because the rooms are clean and comfortable. Before I forget, DO NOT choose the meal inclusive package. Continental breakfast is: whole milk(no 2% or skim), orange juice, frosted flakes or cheerios,white bread only,coffee(no decaf), bannanas and pinneapples if you are lucky.

We arrived on Thursday, August 30 and left Sunday, Sept. 2. Here is one description of the Hotel. If you are looking for a place to shower and lay down, this might be your place. However, at $95 a night, I have stayed in better. There were many items which could be modified for this review to be better and I have listed a few below: As we arrived into our room, the air was not on so we entered into a sauna. As you can imagine, the temperature was a healthy 90ish or more. In addition, the refrigerator was not plugged in when we arrived so any beverages we had stayed hot. There was also no toilet tissue in the bathroom. Luckliy we had our own wipes :-) There was no remote control for the TV in the room which caused a major inconvenience (we had to call to receive both toilet tissue and a remote). The curtains on the windows were paper thin and you cold see through them. Lastly, there was no hot water in the shower. If there was, I didin't get any. Again, if you like to rough it, this might be your place. Not mine for a second annivesary trip. The beach was within walking distance which was very convenient. The people at the Hotel were great! They spoke both english and spanish. We even got to eat a local delicacy called quinepas which I had not tasted since I was a little boy in Panama! Overall, the people at the Hotel were great. They were able to steer us in the right direction for food and etc.. I just believe the lack of direction and leadership from the Hotel management is the downfall.

On the last weekend of July of 2007 my spouse and I travel from TX and spent 3 days of our our 10 day vacation in PR in this hotel. The only bad part of our vacation. It was a complete disapointment.

Enough with the good stuff: The registration was ridiculous, we arrived early and had to wait for almost 2 hrs in a line outside the hotel in order to check-in. We had to pay in advance our stay (not a confirmation of credit card). The beds were worst than the beds in boot camp in the Navy. Not all the lights fixtures worked, but one did. We complaint no one ever came to fixed it. The fridge was not working, complaint again and we figured out ourselves how to make it work. Management never fixed it. NOISY, NOISY, NOISY. The elevator was not working either. Thanks God it was only a third floor. A Special party on a Sunday morning 1:45AM. YES, 1:45AM without previous notice... We complaint about the noise in the party in the pool area, as PR law has restrictions of noise after midnight. The Admin said they could not lowered the volume because the management authorized the party. We asked for the management at 2:00am and the manager walked by and ignored our request to talked with us and said no matter what you request we will not lower the volume or end the party. We called the police who thanks God were able to end the party at 4:00am. Our money was not refunded. There are other better places to stay in the area.
