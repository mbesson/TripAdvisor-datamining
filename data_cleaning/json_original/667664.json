Rooms are clean, front desk area is friendly and helpful. We could not have asked for more. And we almost didn't stay here because of bad review on Trip Advisor site...but my agent assured me this was a good place and she was right! We will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "Jan 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR191561765", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "linemax"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Stay Wonderful resort in a great location.
