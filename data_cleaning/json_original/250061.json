The reason for the stay is that I live in downtown Montreal and wanted to spend the night somewhere quieter away from all the excitement. I rated my stay so low because the buzzing coming from the big electric station directly next to the side of the hotel where my room was located was so loud I didn't sleep a wink and I was wearing earplugs. Yes, it was that loud! To be fair I do have sensitive hearing, but while watching TV I had to turn the volume to the highest setting to hear it over the noise. I complained to the receptionist who came up to my room and told me he couldn't hear anything. Are you kidding??!! He offered to move me to another room but unfortunately none were free on the other side of the hotel. So, I tossed and turned all night before calling it quits and checking out at 5:30am. My ears were actually aching, and I couldn't leave fast enough. The hotel was nice enough in most other aspects. The hotel was practically right next door to the metro - super convenient. Free parking and free wireless internet were also perks. Just make sure to ask to stay on the street side of the hotel in order to avoid the buzzing problem. And you'll have to bring your own fan for white noise during the winter as the AC unit that also includes the fan is turned off.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ridgeway, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, for the price.\u201d", "Author": "brittany f", "ReviewID": "UR122373957", "Content": "My boyfriend I just got back from this hotel.
