I can echo the positive comments from all of these reviews and dismiss the few negative ones simply by stating-- this ain't the Ritz-Carlton, so what did you expect? Yes, the last renovation was probably in the 80s but everything is SO clean, what does it matter? The tremendous positive aspects of this funky little gem in the middle of the city far outweigh my one complaint: the air conditioner took several hours to cool down. It was unseasonably warm in Chicago for October, however, so this was a very small concern and the room was very comfortable after it cooled off. Back to the positives, the cleanliness of the room was impressive and we got fresh sheets and towels daily. The FREE parking included with your room is a huge plus and the lot is walled in on all sides so that the desk clerk can easily view who is coming and going (which is great for safety). The neighborhood is very nice and it seems pretty obvious that the motel owners are working hard to maintain a tasteful presence in the community. There is a little bar across the street which I didn't have a chance to visit but the 24-hour White Castle a block away is perfect for late-night munchies. The continental breakfast is a simple donuts-coffee-cereal offering but I couldn't complain. Again, this place is VERY inexpensive and the free parking totally makes up for not having a huge smorgasbord or extensive toiletries in the bathroom (soap and shampoo are all ya get!). Fearless travelers and those with a sense of humor will LOVE the Heart o' Chicago and marvel at what a terrific value it is, just as I did. People wishing for a 5-star experience will naturally be disappointed so do yourself a favor and stay away if you are overly sensitive or just unrealistic. I found the fellow at the front desk to be a bit quiet but so what? Privacy seems to be encouraged here and I had no troubles at all with noise from any of the other guests or the traffic out front. After 2 decades of visiting the city at various times, I wish I knew about this place years ago! The free parking alone puts it ahead of so many hotels in Chicago that I can honestly say I'll never stay anywhere else in Chicago now that I've found it! What a great bargain and what a cool neighborhood! Thanks Heart o' Chicago!

The two other hotels we've stayed at in the past were sky high ($190 or more per night). We decided to give this one a try. While it wasn't the worst hotel by far, there were enough negatives for us that we probably won't stay there again. In fact, if we'd been in town more than the two day weekend, we probably would have looked for alternate lodging for the remainder of the trip. Good things: 1. The hotel room was very clean and a nice size. 2. The water pressure was good in the shower. 3. The beds were comfortable. Not so good things: 1. It was very noisy as someone mentioned. (Our neighbor was talking on the phone and it souonded like he was sitting in bed next to us... the noises from the busy street and people coming and going at all hours were just as bad.) 2. The friendliness of the staff was spotty. The gentleman I made the reservation with and the one who greeted us when we arrived (possibly the same guy) was friendly enough and helpful. My fiancee called and talked to a \"grumpy old man\" who exclaimed, \"For crying out loud!\" when she couldn't understand what L stop to get off on to get to the hotel and asked him to spell it. 3. It's not as convenient to the L as we would prefer. Off the Thorndale stop, it's a 15-20 minutes walk. Using the Bryn Mawr stop (the one the hotel guy was trying to tell my fiancee), you either walk about 0.1 miles further or you transfer to the 84 bus. 4. The tub drain was a bit clogged so we were standing in ankle-deep water during our showers. 5. We had a furnace filter covering part of the ceiling by the bathroom.

The fruit, oatmeal, donuts, coffee, and juice are standard \"continental breakfast\" fare, which you will receive at most of the hotels in the area, including the $300/night hotels. Anyway, my boyfriend and I found this gem while I was searching for hotels within the city limits that wouldn't require us to apply for a second mortgage. Heart O'Chicago is located on the north side, in a quaint neighborhood called \"Andersonville\". The neighborhood is full of Scandinavian immigrants, and there are lots of shops and bakeries to reflect this culture. (If you want a full breakfast that packs on the calories, try Ann Sather's on Clark St.) The hotel's location couldn't be better. Walk to one corner, and you can hop aboard the Clark St bus. This bus takes you to Wrigley, the alternative shops on Belmont, Giordano's, and all the way downtown if you're patient. If you walk to the other corner, you can catch the Peterson bus to the Bryn Mawr Red Line stop. The Red Line will take you downtown much faster (and, like the Clark bus, drops you off a mere half-block from Wrigley). You can transfer to every El line using the Red line; it's one of the most popular lines and will bring you a short walk (or bus ride) away from most of Chicago's main attractions. The hotel itself offers free parking, which is almost unheard of for Chicago hotels. Sometimes, the lot gets full and they have to double-park guests, so watch for that on busy weekends. It's mostly due to guests having more than one vehicle per room, as the parking lot has enough spaces for each room. Along with the free breakfast and free parking, you get free wireless internet. Sometimes it's a little spotty, depending on which room you're in and how many people are using it, but this isn't exactly a business traveler hotel. Also, who goes to Chicago, only to spend hours on Facebook? The room was the cleanest room I've ever stayed in. It smelled fresh and sanitized. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was hot with good water pressure. It wasn't the fanciest room, but who cares. When you go to Chicago and spend all day and night at attractions and restaurants, all you need is a bed to sleep in and a shower in the morning. For $80, it really couldn't be beat. I made my reservation over the phone, and the rate was cheaper than the online rates. The gentleman was very nice, repeated all of my information, and gave me a confirmation number. When we arrived, he had it written in a ledger, just like the old days before computers. We thought it was charming. Also, I have to admit... the sign sold us. The entire place reminded us of some 1950s hotel in Vegas. If you're into kitschy charm and the retro lifestyle, definitely book this place.

It is located in good Andersonville, near one of Chicago's best places to see, Wrigleyville. Safe place, with lots of young people, elder women, friendly faces. And the more you get close to the Wrigley Field the more the places look cool. The complaints about its location and how long it is to get to transports are exaggerated, in my opinion. Just outside the motel you have the bus that takes you in less than 2 minutes (seriously) to the EL stop \"Bryn Mawr\" or directly to Wrigleyville. Mind that with the cheap CTA card you can take bus and metro as much as you want, at no charge. As for the distance between Bryn Mawr and the Heart i'd like to point out that the taxi we took upon arrival, not knowing the actual distance from the motel (just a straight road!), took us around the neighborhood for a while, just to build up on fares.. jackaxxs. Maybe it's the reason why some people complaint so much about the distance. THE ROOM was superclean, the kind of cleaniness that makes you come back tired, after a day of sightseeing, make a shower and go around the room, barefeet. Not bad.

We're italians and wanted exactly this type of food in the morning, just to start you up. Good! The (latin?) woman at the front desk is rather unpolite, not very gentle.

Terrible experiance.\u201d", "Author": "Honestreview1", "ReviewID": "UR22003714", "Content": "I had a guest visiting Chicago for the 1st time so I recommended the Hotel. The check-in was no problem friendly older man checked us in, room was nice & clean. Gave his CC checked in for 2 nights & was told a receipt would be given upon checkout. He stayed @ the Hotel the 1st night. The following night we stayed out late so he stayed @ my place. He never returned the following morning to return the key and he didn't get any phone calls from the Hotel, so he assumed they would automaticaly charge him for an extra night. When he returned to the hotel that night he wanted to check in with the front desk before he headed up to the room. When he explained everything to the person @ the front desk. The guy was extremly rude and kept cutting him off. Basically he told him that he was going to be charged for the 2 nights and $15 for a new key since he didn't hand it over @ checkout time. When my friend said he was returning the key & would like to check in again, he was told in a terrible tone of voice that, his room was already taken by another guest & that there was no vacancy there for him that he had to go some where else. My friend said he was very upset but didn't want to start any trouble although it seemed that that is what the front desk clerk was trying to start up with him. So he asked if he could get his receipt @ which the F.Desk person (a guy with a strong accent) replied, with even worst temper and physical movement, by basically backing him out of the door telling him he wasn't going to speak to him anymore & he wasn't getting anything from him if he wanted he could call the next day and put in a complaint and finally slammed the door in his face. I wanted to check on my friend to make sure everything went well at the Hotel so I called him an hour afterwards. He told me what had happened and I was truly horrified. He said he didn't want to tell me about it because he didn't want me to feel bad that he had had such a bad experiance happen to him here in Chicago while he was visiting for the first time. He didn't have anywhere to go so he figured he would drive around until the following morning. I immediatly called the Hotel. Now with out exagerating the phone must have rang more that 20 times before it was picked up but I wasn't going to hang up. I was very upset and couldn't believe what had happened. The guy didn't even say the name of the Hotel so I had to ask if this was the Hotel. So I said I had a couple of questions for him in a very pleasant voice. 1st I asked is there any vacancy. @ which he replied yes there are a \"FEW ROOMS\" available! So I said okay well now I want to ask you another question. @ which he cut me off by saying \"why do you have another question I said there are rooms available\". I told him that I heard him the 1st time but it would be nice if he didn't cut me off because it was rude and I still wanted to ask him some other stuff. So I went on to tell him everything my friend told me happened and the whole time he kept cutting me off and tried rasing his voice but then I raised mine and said I wasnt my friend & I wasn't going to let him treat me the way he treated him to which he started saying it was a mistake that he misundurstood, that he never said there was no vacancy basically everything the opposite of what my firend had told me. He finally said to send him back that there was only one room available but he would hold it for 1/2 an hr until he got there(even thought he had told me there were a few when I called but again he said I misunderstood, when I brought it up) . I called my friend, insisted he come over and stay @ my place but he felt bad about everything already so he preffered to go back to the Hotel. Once he arrived the guy apologized and tried to convince him that some how there had been a missunderstanding on my friends side. He even added that he had already spoken to the person that would be there in the morning for check out and that he had explained what had happened and that a discount would be offered to him as an apology. The best part yet came when my friend finally came to the checkout and the same guy was downstairs and basically said there is no discount, call if you want to put a complaint and kicked him out all over again. I didn't find out about this until 2 days after he had left so I went to the Hotel and set a complaint to the person @ the front desk who claimed they were an assistant manager. They heard everything with detail and they apologized and said they would leave a note with my name & # so that the person that runs the place supervisor/Manager could call me back. They promised something would def. be done about it. They also told me while I was there that the room my friend was staying @ didn't have a second lock so the guy shouldn't have checked the room out to someone else while my friend still had another key. They also said they wouldn't put the reason why my name & number was being placed on the board for the Supervisor/Manager to see because if \"others\" working there found out it was a complaint it might dissaper??? Are they serious!! Aparrently it has happened that someone has complained and yet the complaint filled has just dissapered. I got a phone call 2 days later from someone claiming they where calling to investigate a complaint. They said they were calling from the Hotel, the voice sounded very familiar so I asked who was I speeking to @ which they replied \"I'm calling form Heart O Chicago\". I said I know but who am I speaking to what is your name! The guy finally said it was him who I was complaining about and he wanted to know why I was doing it, basically getting all defensive. I told him I wasn't going to speak to him, that I was told someone specificaly would call me from management and I had nothing to explain to him so I hung up. 3 weeks later nothing from no one..... I guess my # and name misteriously dissapered from the Management board. I stopped in last night to ask about what was going on and the person @ the front desk said he didn't know anything and didn't want to get involved he just gave me a card with the Hotels # on it. Aparently there is no way of contacting anyone else like managment thru email or phone. Just by leaving a stupid note on the board that will end up in the garbage before they decide to stop by to see if things are going well.

Reading a previous critique of the motel, you may want to keep in mind that loose change on a table or nightstand is a common method of tipping housekeeping. If you don't intend to tip, keep your change out of sight. That's common motel/hotel sense. If you are looking to eat or shop, the next southerly street (1 block) on N Ridge is N Clark. Head south (right) and there are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, markets and shops within walking distance.

The motel lies in the northern part of the Andersonville neighborhood, which is undergoing a revival at the moment. It's a vibrant place populated simultaneously by multi-generation families, 100-year-old hardware stores, and Swedish bakeries, alongside new clothing boutiques, gourmet bistros, and gay & lesbian book stores. It's a fantastic neighborhood. The Heart of Chicago also sits right on the #84 (Peterson) bus route, which will take you directly to the Bryn Mawr Red Line stop in about five minutes. I bought a 7-day unlimited use CTA pass and used it constantly. Downtown, Wrigley, the Navy Pier, the Museum Campus, O'Hare and Midway ... there isn't anywhere in the city that you can't get to with a CTA pass! And the food! Holey moley!

The red line El is about a 10-15 minute walk away, so we used that to get to the Loop with no problem (the bus system is also efficient).

The first attraction was the price, $69 for a one bed double, complimentary continental breakfast and FREE parking. What a bargain! Our room was clean and comfortable. Due to traffic, we arrived at 8:30 pm without dinner. We asked the front desk for a nearby restaurant. He told us to go 2 blocks to Clark St, hang a right and go another 4 blocks. Since we had been in the car all day I asked if it was safe for us to walk over there. No problem, this is a residential area. We set off on foot and came across Andersonville, a lovely neighborhood area with an eclectic mix of shops, ethnic restaurants and bakeries. After some exploring, we selected a Thai restaurant for a tasty dinner and great service. We felt totally safe walking around the area and back to our hotel. My husband's weekend seminar was on Lake Shore Drive near Navy Pier. The Heart of Chicago is north of downtown and it was an easy drive to get him to his seminar. For me, I skipped downtown shopping and explored Clark St, driving south from our hotel towards downtown. I came across many great neighborhood pockets to explore. The only downside to the hotel is that the hotel is on a corner and there is a great deal of traffic going by on the street late into the night. We were aware of it but were still able to get a good night's sleep both nights. A light sleeper might have a problem with it.

When we booked the motel, we read other Trip Advisor reviews and were expecting a no-frills but clean and decent motel at a great price. That's exactly what we got. I gave it 4 stars not because of how fabulous it is, but because it is a fabulous value. Sure, the place is dated and is nothing fancy; sure, you get a single dougnut for your 'continental breakfast.' But if you would rather save a few bucks and use it for the rest of your trip, it's well worth a stay at the Heart. One point worth mentioning - I'm not so sure this place would have been as convenient if we weren't driving a car. It is NOT downtown proper, and although there is of course public transportation, it's not always the most convenient option. Bottom line: if we had a car in Chicago next time we visit we would stay here again, but if we were on foot, we might look elsewhere.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "glenview, IL", "Title": "\u201cVery Retro, Very Clean, Very Affordable, and Very Handicapt Accesible\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4978123", "Content": "I'm a wheelchaired patron and I found this hotel uniquely accessable given it's size and age.

We took the bus on the corner and it took a minumum of 45 up to 1 and half hours to reach downtown and then back again. Too much time on bus. It is a motel the room you enter from outside of the building. I can not express how loud it is inside the room during sleeping hours. MOTEL is on busy intersection lots of sirens, horns, and car noises. BRING earplugs. The room is clean, cleaned daily, friendly staff, and donuts and instant coffee offered each morning.
