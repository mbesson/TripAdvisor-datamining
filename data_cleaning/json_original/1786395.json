I couldn't believe the pictures on the website were for real, but they were. I found it a little silly but secretly kinda liked it (not so secret any more). -- The hotel is well located in SoHo just off of Broadway -- we had a pleasant walk from battery park in less than 30 minutes. -- The rooms are small but well appointed and functional. I liked the large shower, comfortable bed, and window that actually opens. The desk and sink were really squeezed in making it hard to use either effectively. -- The room boasts lots of technology. You get an iPad, but it didn't appear to have an Internet browser loaded (huh?) and an iPod dock, but I couldn't get mine to work. Internet will cost you, which is one of my big pet peeves.

Arrived prior to family with 4 LARGE bags for the week, the hotel has a funky gardeny entrance that sets the actual front door 25 yards off the curb, no bell man in sight to help and as I approached the door he finally appears after chatting it up with others at entrance>> this is likely a management issue rather than bell issue, with that distance from curb to door you simply need to make sure there is always someone on curb,,,at ~$400/nt that expectation is minimum I suspect, even if its just to flag a cab. Rather than running to flag a cab my wife was urged to do so,,,see the $400/nt comment above. Crosby is a side street so catching a cab there is likely not happening unless you are catching a cab after a drop off. Desk staff, especially Catie were awesome and super accommodating, Kelly in restaurant same thing,,just really friendly and nice. Joey, our exiting bell man was great, lugged a ton of stuff for us and packed the car. Room was clean, fresh, cool as you'd expect from Mondrian, the only watch out is staying there with 3 in room gets tight and also the major issue is the translucent bathroom door, morning comes quickly as the shower is really a clear window to the world as well which turns the lights on well earlier than we'd like. Not sure that every room has the same door, I'd ask if you enjoy sleeping in on vacation. Food in restaurant was very good, just couldn't get up to eat it more than once. If returning to area I may stay again if alone or with wife only, tough call, we were lucky with good weather for walking etc otherwise getting to trains and cabs would be a major issue. With other Luxury near by and Sheraton Tribeca around the corner for value not sure I'd do Mondrian again. Also this was a business and pleasure trip,,,poor for business in room, just not equipped as many of the hipster places are not for business.

On our first pass down Crosby, we missed the place. From ground level, it's easy to do. The signage is small and hard to spot from a car. That's the beginning and end of my complaining. Signage on this ultra-modern, upscale property should be more prominent on both Crosby and Lafayette. This would certainly help with walk-in restaurant business. But once we found our way and got up to our 21st-floor room, we knew we were in a special place. The Mondrian has a cool, hip vibe from the low lighting to the stark colors to the ceiling-to-floor windows in the guest rooms. We had a 180-view of Lower Manhattan. Gorgeous, especially at sunset. The amenities are what you'd expect in an upscale brand though our room wasn't spacious. Still, it was comfortable and pleasant to be in. The real draw here is the location -- in Soho within a few blocks of Little Italy and Chinatown. Two-minute walk to a subway stop that will take you wherever you need to go.

On both counts the hotel met our needs, though on both counts it also fell a little short. Highlights: - Great location, right in the middle of SoHo. Easy to get uptown, downtown and everywhere else. - Very friendly staff. Good service as you would expect. - Great bed, great pillows (very important), and very clean. The amount of blue in the room and hotel can be a bit overpowering at times though. - Good view if you get a room on a higher floor. - Quality TV and sound system with ipod/iphone dock. - iPads in the rooms for guests to use. - Decor was nice but might not be to everyone's taste. Questionable: - The design of the rooms. Don't know what the other rooms are like but ours was a strange design with very thin walls. The bathroom is basically screened off rather than walled off so privacy could be an issue for couples who are just getting to know each other, if you know what I mean, plus you can hear other guests sometimes. - The entrance way to our room was a wasted space where they decided to place the bathroom sink. Hmmm. - All rooms have a shower instead of a bath. Apparently you can ask for a room with a bath so remember to do so if you want one. - Our room had a tiny table so if you want to do some work in the room it can be a little difficult to spread out. - Room service prices. I don't know what the prices are like at other hotels but $50 for a simple breakfast of fruit, eggs and coffee seems a little steep to me. Tips: - Ask for a higher room. - Ask for a room with a bath if you want one. - If on a business trip, don't expect to be able to work in your room too much as the tables are tiny. - Eat out. There are plenty of amazing restaurants within walking distance of the hotel that are much cheaper than room service. Conclusion: A very cool hotel in a great location. Not the best room but definitely does the job, and the beds are fantastic. The hotel bars downstairs attract a hip crowd that can be a little too cool for school, but hey, that's New York.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThoroughly enjoyed the Mondrian Soho\u201d", "Author": "dramamama56", "ReviewID": "UR124740019", "Content": "Stayed for one night while in the city -- and are so glad we did.

The entrance to the hotel is lovely--a long ivy-covered tunnel, with limited signage, so it pays to know the exact location ahead of time. It is a very brief walk from several subway lines. The \"lobby\" is small and looks like a somewhat disorganized parlor from \"Alice in Wonderland,\" complete with furry lamps, velvet upholstery, and ornate dining chairs haphazardly strewn about. I kept having to look out for the heavy metallic dining chair that always seemed to be sitting awkwardly in the most direct route from the elevator to the front door. There is a small concierge desk in the lobby but no indication of the elevators or a registration desk. The elevators are located in an alcove hidden from view in back of the lobby. All the reviews that talk about the dark elevators are absolutely correct. It is so dark in the elevators that you have to be sure to push your floor's button before the doors close and you have no light, because the buttons only light up when pushed. While many of the other details of the hotel seem like borderline hipster silliness, this detail is way over the line into complete silliness. However, this detail can be overlooked by the wonderful rooms. Yes, the rooms are indeed small, but the decor is fabulous. The minimalist blue and white paint and white bed linens gives the room a light, airy feel despite its small size. The floor to ceiling windows also afford terrific views and expand the vistas of the room. The room is designed for maximum efficiency without sacrificing luxury. We had a deluxe king room. The marble shower was high end and large enough for two (even three possibly :-). The toiletries were Malin and Goetz and were a nice touch. The wet bar also had a small pharmacy tray stocked with essentials such as a \"mile high kit\" and ibuprofen. No standard plain water glasses, cut crystal stems were de rigeuer. What else can I say? There were no noise issues whatsoever. The heating/HVAC worked wonderfully. The location was very convenient to South Broadway shopping and Chinatown. Many terrific restaurants were in easy walking distance. If you want to catch a cab, exit the back entrance onto Lafayette--tons of cabs available. All of the staff, every single person we met who worked there, was unfailing pleasant and wished us a good stay. I don't think I've ever stayed in a hotel with such a gracious staff..

No IM not crazy, just a change of pace. I usually stay in the midtown/Times Square area whenever I visit the city, but not this time. Wanted to try something different. I got a great \"advance purchase\" deal as a member of Tablet Hotels and booked 2 rooms for our 11 nights stay. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a wonderful smile and courteous reception of the doorman who took our luggage and showed us the way to the lobby on the 1st floor. Easy check in and we even took advantage of a room upgrade to a suite for another USD80.00 per night. I figured our deal was so good, that I could add on the room upgrade and be comfortable in a larger room. All NYC hotel rooms are small. Loved the room, the cal or harmony in the room with the crisp white contrasting with the royal blue. Bed was probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in. There were ample drawers in the dresser and bed to unpack and put away our clothes. The only thing the is no space for the empty bags which I wished I could store for the 11 nights. But we made it work. Our room was a King Suite with separate sitting area, floor to ceiling glass windows looking west over Crosby Street with a glimpse of the Hudson River. The shower was a bit voyeuristic with a big glass window to the city. I don't know what kind of peep show I was providing for 11 nights. But I was not arrested. House cleaning staff were thorough and non-invasive and courteous. The dining room at Imperial No. 9 is beautiful. Rustic and elegant at the same time. A Garden Green House with crystal chandeliers, best suited for an organic/farm to table restaurant. But it is not. The menu is seafood and we did dine there for one dinner and 2 breakfasts during our stay. Very peculiar food, unappealing plating and outright unappetizing. What a pity. Thankfully we are in SoHo and there was ample dining choices all around with amazing food. We did a Thai Angel delivery to our room one rainy night. Excellent thai food from next door. Some restaurants I'd recommend which we ate at are: Certainly BALTHAZAR at Crosby/Spring for Breakfast, but try and make it before the crowds come from 9. Lunch are L'ECOLE Broadway/Grand, and then dinner at DAVID BURKE KITCHEN Thompson/Grand St, ABC KITCHEN 18th/Broadway, TAMARIND (Indian) Hudson/Franklin in Tribeca and as always a must do for us is always lunch in the dining room at THE MODERN at MOMA. Some misses for us was Kittichai, Gramercy Tavern, Chin Chin and Dim Sum at Oriental Garden. None of these lived up to the hype. Will review each later. The staff at all levels of the Mondrian Soho were wonderful. All the guys at the door, the concierge, the hostesses at Imperial No. 9, the Front Desk team and house-keeping.

The bonuses of a stay here were the in room IPAD with free Wifi (if you use your own computer and tablet you will have to pay for internet) Its great location on the fringe of Chinatown, Little Italy and in Southern SoHo.

We are glad we haven't paid the real price f the hotel since it is pricey. The hotel is a the very beginning not very obvious to find unless you take a good look at the map and look at the hotel picture to find how the hotel entrance looks like. The advantage of this hotel, is that it's still new and you'll end up seeing the good side of the hotel for being new. I've read a lot of previous reviews saying how they would hear how loud the neighbors rooms can be. It can be sort of true, but we've barely heard anything from them. Maybe its by luck. There will be at the beginning some issues in the room, like the function of the shower that can be tricky that the technician will help resolve. But you will have the neediness to almost harass the reception, by calling several times with a little of anger, to finally have the person come to the room. I don't quite understand the logic of needing to wait and call several times for the person to come and show up at our room. Especially when you need him not once but twice. I will not blame the technician but the reception that maybe they feel to good to make an effort to dispatch the technician asap. The room can seem small but the way it was designed, makes it see there's no need for more space. I can say I've previously been in a crappier hotel in the past in NYC that was a lot more smaller than this one. So there should be no complaints about the size, since we're in NYC Manhattan, what do you expect? a penthouse size room? The bathroom is a thing to admire since its marbled from top too bottom. One thing that was enjoyable to have in the room was the offered Ipad 2 to be used during the stay. We we're very tempted to bring the ipad 2 out in town but we had the scarcity of loosing it. The only thing that cant be criticize in about the hotel, is the restaurant. From the entrance view, the restaurants looks lovely, but do to the high price of the food we never eat there. So we've always dined out. The trip was great but there's one thing really one thing you will have to know about the place that's essential. The Bell Boys will try to get the run of your money and I'm glad I haven't felt for it. They breath lies when it comes to help you finding a taxi. When you try to take a taxi for the airport or for whatsoever reason... the bell boy in reality will not run around the block to find one. No even after waiting 30 mins for him to find one, he actually stands in front of the second not obvious entrance trying \"with so much energy\" in finding a cab with a wave of the hand... Yeah he doesn't budge he just stand there hope to get a taxi that already taken. He just never goes out of the hotel piremessis to find one for you. The best part of the whole story is there's a taxi limo at the hotel entrance, that the bell boy will try to convince you to take. The charge of taking that taxi to go at Laguardia airport: 60$. So we finally too initiative too go up the street and get ourselves a taxis after much frustration of the noncooperation from the bell boy. I think he was shocked that we haven't felt for is trap. And we gladly found a taxi after 10 minutes of going up in the streets. Is it luck ?maybe but all i know i saved a lot of money. The better part of all this is when talking to the taxi driver, a real taxi limo will not charge such a high amount of money...So that taxi limo waiting at the hotel is a buddy of the bell boy that will get profit out of you so that bell boy gets a sort of commission out of the scam. That is what really destroyed the end of our trip is the temptation of getting scammed by a guy that as the same age as us. Besides we're two university students that as not a lot of money that went to spend a 3 day shopping trip. Getting ripped off by an idiot like him isn't our thing. Such a heartless, and lazy bell boy. Hope you get fired soon. I regret I haven't filed a complaint about that guy for doing what he did. But i would have never known about the scam without being informed by that nice taxi driver we had.

We had to complain again, and after a bit of a struggle the following night they gave us a bigger room with a great view.

Twice I called the concierge to schedule a limo for my wedding and both times they never got back to me. I had to book my own limo for my wedding, which was fine but irritating for such a fancy hotel. My reservations were under my first name and not my last so they couldn't find it and I was panicked as the front desk people tried to not look worried. When we asked what came with the room the desk person said a mini bar. We were never told about the safe, restaurants, internet or laundry service. My husband could not get over how unprofessional the front desk staff was. There was a bottle of wine in our room with a note for a different person---attention to detail, not so good. We had asked the person who booked my room many times about photos on our wedding day and I was assured it would not be a problem. 5 minutes into photos I was told the manager was upset and wanted to know who gave us permission for photos. I WAS LIVID. We were running late anyway for our wedding and then had to deal with this after I asked so many times if it would be okay. It started my wedding day off really bad. We asked the restaurant attendant how we went about getting some food and she snapped at us and said to ask the front desk she didn't know how it worked, we has to sign up in advance. She was so awful. For such an expensive hotel, you have to pay for internet! They do have ipads in the room that you can get on for free but it was set up to be quite a bother. We were also told that we would be able to use a steamer for our wedding clothes when we booked the room only to find out we couldn't and if we did we would have a huge charge. After talking with the manager we miraculously had a steamer in our room after being told by the front desk person that they weren't portable. On the up side, the room itself was INCREDIBLE, clean and like nothing I have ever seen, blue carpet and crisp white walls. Floor to ceiling windows with views of the city, perfect lighting for the make up artist and photos, an amazing bathroom and just over all outstanding and dreamy. I would stay here again just because it is that beautiful and it was perfect for a wedding. Hope the staff can try to smile and be a bit more friendly next time. They also let us stay an extra hour after check out time which I thought was very, very nice.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "Detts11", "ReviewID": "UR116777084", "Content": "This hotel is amazing it has the nest location of any in SOHO.

The location is great. Very close to the Subway (Canal Street N,Q,R is the closest stop) and just a short walk to Little Italy and Chinatown. Finding the hotel initially can be a little challenging as there is no sign displayed, but as soon as you see a courtyard with a walkway with climbing vines, you've got there. Reception is not actually on the ground floor, you need to take an elevator up one level but don't be concerned about getting lost, the friendly doormen will make sure you head in the right direction. Checking in was very efficient. OK, the rooms. Like most hotel rooms in New York they are not large, but they are equipped with everything you need except a coffee maker, which I didn't find too burdensome as I've never been impressed by the stuff that hotels supply in the room anyway. Our bed was a king sized bed and very comfortable. I loved the fact that the bed had additional storage built into the base as well as a decent sized closet and a chest of draws. Every room has an iPad in it which largely takes the place of the big books that you find in most hotels. You can access the Internet for free via this iPad, accessing it through any other device can bring you a charge of approx $10 a day. The Internet service was reliable during our stay. You can also access the websites of some of the major papers via the iPad, I noticed the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and the British Guardian Newspaper for example. The bathroom is small, just enough room for a shower and a WC. Water pressure and temperature was great. If bathroom privacy is a major concern for you, be aware that there is frosted glass panelling separating the bathroom from the rest of the room, no you can't see what is going on in there but it's not the best sound barrier. The sink is actually in the room entrance foyer and separate from the rest of the bathroom The room also contains a Mini bar (which thankfully is not of the type fitted with sensors that charge you the moment you pick something up). It keeps things cool but not cold, for that you'll have to call for ice. A phone call to the front desk will quickly get you a large bucket of ice, the floors themselves do not have ice making machines and there is no ice bucket in the room. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and always seemed to be smiling, looks like they enjoy their work. Some earlier reviews did comment about the noise. I am a light sleeper but found this hotel no nosier than any others I have stayed in. In fact the hotel was fully booked but there was no noise from adjoining guest rooms. In the evenings, the ground floor restaurant and bar do appear to become quite a social attraction, coming back in shorts and a tee shirt did make me feel a little underdressed when compared to the patrons of the bar, but that didn't matter to the hotel staff who were always welcoming. If you do need food or drinks without using the hotel facilities, there is a 24 hour grocery store on Broadway and plenty of other places which are not 24 hour but may better meet your needs. Overall I was extremely satisfied with my stay, friendly staff, the rooms were kept clean, and a great location from which to explore New York City.

The mini bar was reasonably priced and had a thoughtful and cute selection of items for sale.

We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stayed at a boutique hotel in ages and we were pleasantly surprised. As others have noted, our cab driver couldn't figure out how to get to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc9 Crosby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so instead of battling traffic again, we just walked half a block to the hotel. There is no sign outside but we recognized the greenery and canopy from the photos we saw here on Trip Advisor. We paid $30 including tip for our cab ride from La Guardia at around 12pm. The staff at the door were quite young - a trend we saw throughout the hotel. There weren't any 'grown-ups' over the age of 35 that we could see. The language and manner in which we were spoken to was professional but definitely California cool, very informal. \"Hey, Brother, let me help you with that.\" \"Hey man, my name is <insert name>, let me know if you have any questions.\" Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because we were the same age and perhaps some of the older people in the hotel were not spoken to like that. Since we arrived too early for check-in, we left our bags with the boys. We went to check-in, which is located on the second floor and was relatively quick. We needed to send some work emails and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to give us the WIFI code. As a result, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to pay for internet during our stay. Perhaps that was an oops on their end, but we were happy about that. Upon entering the hotel, there is a nice fragrance, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is all blue and white and the restaurant and bar are beautifully decorated with glass and other beautiful textures and materials. It must be beautiful in the winter as well. There is a beautiful balcony opposite the check-in to just sit out and relax \u00e2\u20ac\u201c granted, its astroturf, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful contrast to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s d\u00c3\u00a9cor and quite welcoming. When we returned to get our room after 3pm, we were upgraded to a King room from a Queen room on a high floor; the view was great. The elevator ride was surprisingly dark with a dim blue light and played loud music. We had trouble with our key, but still managed to get in the room. This problem was never resolved although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention it until late on our second day. Apparently all the vacuuming of the halls sends fibers into the air which block the key readers in the doors. The rooms are on the smaller side, but its standard for NYC as others have mentioned. The floor-to-ceiling windows were beautiful as was the d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The royal blue carpets were clean, but show every spec of dirt and dust. The layout was well thought out with storage in the base of the bed and a fairly large chest of drawers. Showers were decent; my husband didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there was enough pressure, but I found no issues with it at all and I like a very strong shower. The toiletries were very nice from Malin and Goetz. They were replenished each day even though the original bottles were not completely finished. The relatively small sink is outside the shower/toilet room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wish they had a towel rack to hang hand towels/face cloths; nowhere to put them to dry properly. Safe was in the closet, but was high up on the shelf in the closet so for someone of my height (5\u00e2\u20ac\u21223\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), it was hard to see what we put in there. Beds were beautiful to look at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very comfy when lying down, but both my husband and I had trouble sleeping all three nights. The beds were a bit too soft for our liking and the pillows were feather. We changed them to foam, but still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep as well as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hoped. There is no turn-down service in the hotel although there is room service which we never used. Overall, the room was very clean and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a complete germaphobe. Although I wanted to break out the Lysol, I fought the urge. Breakfast was included with our rate each morning. We were pleasantly surprised by the Continental breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not as bad as others have felt it was. Fresh fruit, nuts, cheeses, cold-cuts, muffins and the some of the most delicious croissant I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reminiscent of visits to Paris. For $21, it would have been steep since we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not crazy-about-breakfast people, but definitely better than other hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. The last day I should mention someone in the kitchen seriously screwed up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they ran out of croissant at 9:05am. Come on. I know the number of guests dropped significantly on the last day, but come on. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotta have some bread for guests. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed with that oversight. Granted, they were apologetic and offered plain toast, but seems to me that kind of problem is resolved by calling a local bakery and getting more croissants STAT. There were line-ups of guests after we left breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m certain people were not pleased. They called our cab back to La Guardia relatively quickly from the Lafayette St. entrance and were very polite as they bid us adieu. Overall, our stay was quite uneventful and enjoyable. We liked the proximity to Canal St. and the Yellow subway line\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we got everywhere we need to go with that (including a mistake trip to Brooklyn on an Express train!), but we loved the area. After staying in the Upper East Side most of our visits to NYC, this was refreshing. Yes, it is on the lower east part of Soho, perhaps not really IN Soho but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like we were not part of the excitement or too far into Chinatown. We would definitely stay here again and will likely recommend it to our friends. Be sure to check out consolidators such as Hotwire for great deals.

You have to call down for ice, which means you have to tip every time you want ice ... lolwut? Windows open slightly for semi-fresh NYC air - but I like opening windows. Slightly noisy air conditioner but it worked GREAT, and NYC was HOT when we visited. One free bottle of water per day. Leaving a tip on the bed does not result in more goodies or extras like chocolate on the bed or more bathroom sundries. Nor a thank you from maid staff. Cute feminine inspired boutique hotel with extremely friendly staff. Would not recommend room service, ever. Very close to Chinatown! Very close to Little Italy. In lower SoHo which has terrible traffic but LOTS of \"action\" (people on the streets). Chinese food and Italian food surprisingly meh/average. Very surprising. Noah's Ark deli near Lower East Side (but in a nice area) is EXCELLENT NY Jewish deli. Seriously. Central Park in summertime is freakin' amazingly beautiful. NYC people were ALL - every. single. one.

I would have preferred if she had approached us about it if she knew that it had happened. There was not a good explanation of how this serious safety issue could have happened or whether they knew how to prevent it from happening again. Of lesser concern, but also problematic, is the room entrance design, which places your neighbor's door directly facing yours about three feet away in a very small hallway. This creates huge noise issues as your neighbor enters and exits their room (in our case every night very late). Noise is a big problem here as the walls are also poorly insulated.

The hotel is very trendy and beautiful. As other reviews have stated, there is no visible sign outside and no directions to reception when you first walk in...but it's not that hard if you know the address and/or have seen pictures! I'm not a cab person...I prefer the subway, and the NQR/6 is right around the corner. Also steps to Chinatown and Little Italy and nice shopping, either boutique or Bloomingdales. The bed in my room was extremely comfortable and I can say that I had two of the best nights of sleep. The walls are extremely thin. I did not mind any of the noise from the lobby...not did I hear much of it once I reached my room. The music in the lobby and the halls fit the hotel very well. I would not expect rooms to be completely soundproof, but I was upset at being able to hear even the smallest noises (people zipping up their clothes next door when getting dressed in the morning) or conversations of the housekeeping members in the hallway and on their walkies. I did not complain, as I would not expect the hotel to ask someone to zipper quietly or re-insulate the walls during my stay, but sound between rooms and the hallway is something they should consider for the future. Housekeeping is done until 10pm at night. On my first day out, I came back from a meeting at 4pm and my room had not yet been made up. I wanted to take a nap before going out for the evening, and even though I put out a privacy sign, I got a call from housekeeping (after hearing a walkie talkie outside my door) asking when they could make up the room. I did see that on the iPad in the room, there is a section to request housekeeping, so it may be beneficial to use that when you first go out for the day so that you come back to a made-up room. By biggest problem was at check-in. As a little background info, I am one of the people who no longer carries a credit card. I have a debit card that can be swiped as a credit card. I usually keep my funds in savings, and transfer over small amounts to my card account to use when needed. So upon check-in, my hotel room was paid. I was asked to see a credit card, which would not be charged, but used to put a hold for incidentals. I was told that the card was declined and asked for another charge. When I asked the hold about, I was told that $300 was held for incidentals. I understand that copying a card or holding a small amount is common, but I found $300 to be very large. I didn't want to explain my full financial arrangements to the lady at check-in, but I told her that I would need to transfer some money over. I could not get internet service on my phone, and she told me that people tend to get service near the terrace. I still could not, so walked downstair and outside to call my bank, and by that time was unable to complete the transaction. I had enough to pay for the hotel, have a little cash for the night, and planned to do my transferring in the morning. I asked her (Kate, I believe), if there was any way I they could amend this to $150 until the morning. She spoke to her manager and came back and was able to do that. I have to say that Kate was extremely pleasant in what could have been an embarrassing situation for me. I mentioned that the $300 hold was not on my reservation or any paperwork and she apologized for that. Nothing was her fault and she handled it well. However, I believe that the hotel should let a guest know the hold beforehand, as $300 is a steeper amount than customary, especially when the room is fully paid for in advance. It made my first 1/2 hour in the hotel very uncomfortable. After that, besides the non-music hotel noise, I had a great time. I hope to visit this hotel again in the future.

And the rooms, which are tiny, are efficient and nicely appointed and comfortable. But if you want room service, food at the restaurant, drinks at the bar or -- G-D FORBID -- A CAB -- forget about it. What you will get is a total disregard for your happiness or satisfaction.

That depends. They don't serve between 3 and 5 pm. So no snacks after you've gone shopping. Of course, some staff will say that they have food. Others won't. The truth is: no food between 3 and 5.

We went up to our room, it was clean, white and fun (no issues there).We did not have a problem with noise like in other reviews (15th Floor) I have to mention that the elevator is a little to dark and moody, You really cant see who is in there with you.

I was very excited to discover the hotel and to book the weekend at a very good introductory rate. I was enticed by the press that I read and by the whole experience of being at a hotel during its opening weeks. I have to say that, overall, I was not disappointed. The vine-covered entry way and outdoor \"courtyard\" were very welcoming. The funky, artsy blue and white decor of the lobby was quite unique. It was little confusing getting to the front desk (located on the second floor), and we started up the stairs with our luggage in tow, as we were unaware of the location of the elevator. But an employee quickly assisted me in carrying it up the stairs. We arrived from the airport at 1:30, but could not check in earlier than 3:00. The management did, however, store our luggage as we wandered around the area. (The location is great! I much prefer the little shops and restaurants in this part of the city to midtown.) When we got to the room, I was definitely impressed with the cleanliness and comfort...and, yes, with the ipad! The pillows are absolutely the best pillows I have ever had in a hotel! On the issue of noisiness, I had read reviews complaining about the \"thin walls.\" So we mentioned to the desk upon check-in that I was a light sleeper, so we got a room on the 23rd floor. We had no issue with noise, and the view was astounding! During our stay we experienced both the bar and restaurant. Though not inexpensive, both were excellent! And kudos to the bartender on Sunday morning...great guy! Actually, all of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. But, there were a couple of glitches: it took quite a while for us to get our luggage after checking into the room. We actually had to call to track it down. There needs to be some more specific written directions in each room as to how to operate the ipod dock and the ipad. The tap water had a strange milky appearance...the hotel needs to provide bottled-water for no cost. We had a leak from under the sink and called the front desk. No one ever showed up to look into it. And the night club-like atmosphere in the bar and lobby at night was a little intimidating for those of us who are far beyond being 30 somethings! But, all in all, I would recommend this hotel. The management seems responsive to working on the glitches. The Mondrian SoHo is on its way to being a fine hotel!", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here if you actually want to sleep\u201d", "Author": "kategem", "ReviewID": "UR101503424", "Content": "I'm not a precious traveller.

Our room was not ready (turned out to be trashed by prior client) so we were upgraded to a double double room which also was not ready. No matter, we went to eat at Balthazar as the room was readied (Good resto not far from this hotel). Alas, the room was still not ready when we returned. Once we did have our room, we so enjoyed our stay! Now, keep in mind there is no sign in the front. It is a lovely vined front and while not fully completed when we were there, there is now an arched vined walkway in to the front door ( a \"verdant entryway\"). We were met greeted at the front door (Crosby Street) by a young fellow who took our bags and advised us to go up the stairs to the second floor to check in. As we entered the main floor, it was a delight to see the large blue chairs and artsy set up with fun Dr. Suessesque fluffy tall lamps. Of course, this is to channel the early (non-Disney) Beauty and the Beast movie. Thus one could describe some of the chairs as large enough for a beast but lovely enough for a beauty! Up the stairs we went, and Shawn (Sean) was a very gracious and friendly staff member who did the best to accommodate us as we checked in despite the problems of room availability due to previous late staying (and errant) guests. Once in our room, I was delighted again with the decor of white, blue and chrome! The pillows with the blue design are such a lovely accent. The view from our window was absolutely great! Yes, you do have a free iPad in your room (don't lose/take it...will cost you dearly!). The shower was great and the beds most comfy! We found our room to be quiet. In the morning we were delighted to have a free continental breakfast since it was soft opening time and Imperial 9 (the restaurant) was not open yet (opened March 1, I believe). We were most pleased with the food and decor of Imperial 9! I sat on a pretty golden benchette and I noted there were tastefully done \"fish scaled\" walls. Truly would love to go again!
