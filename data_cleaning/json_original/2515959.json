One tip: if you don't want to be disturbed during a mid-afternoon nap definitely put the Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob outside. The cleaning staff seems to make multiple rounds asking if there is anything you need.

After much research, I decided The Orchard was reasonably priced (for San Francisco) and well located. I wanted access to the hotspots of The City without being in the middle of crazed tourisits. I am thrilled with my experience at The Orchard from the large room and wonderfully updated and HUGE bathroom (again, for San Francisco). I have stayed at many a \"boutique\" hotel that were absolutely tiny but so opposite at The Orchard. Chinatown and Union Square are both within walking distance and you can get a great work-out from those hills. Chinatown is 2 blocks away and if you go straight through the neigborhood across the street from the hotel, the hill(s) and stairs are exactly what you need before hitting an authentic Chinese restaurant and bakery! Remember, look for the restaurants who serve the local culture, not the tourist traps in ethnic neighborhoods. You will have a much better, inexpensive, and friendly experience. We chose to valet park our vehicle at The Orchard. We simply needed to leave and come back once a day so felt it would be easier to spend the $45 ($40 + $5 parking tax) to have it parked for us. If you choose to use valet, call down for your car 15 minutes before you are ready to leave. One morning, it took them 20 minutes to retrieve our car (even though we pre-called) and the next morning it only took 10 minutes. They will call your room if the car is ready before you come downstairs. I always request the highest floor possbile when traveling. I like a view and I like quiet. We were on the 10th floor on opposite end of hotel from Bush/Powell corner and I was shocked at how quiet our room was. Quieter than my house and noise from my neighborhood!

It's like being nickel and dimed to death - or death by 1000 small cuts! One pair of slippers, not two. Missing toiletries not replenished. No fitted sheet (the flat sheets used on the mattress were never quite big enough nor anchored quite well enough to prevent bunching up overnight). A single caffeinated coffee pod, so one person must choose decaf. An old goldfish cracker on the carpet. The location is superb, but the windows on our 6th floor were so filthy, it wasn't much fun to look out over the rooftops in what would otherwise have suggested a Parisian experience. The bathrooms are spacious with lovely tilework, but the floor was so sticky (seemed to be cleaning product, nothing worse, and more water applied - by us, using the bath linens - mostly ameliorated the problem) that it distracted from what would otherwise have been a great first impression. No bathmats scattered around to tempt you to stay longer - tile floors get pretty cold in San Fran in the winter! Not enough hangers. Worst of all, the free in-room internet never did work, despite multiple calls to the toll free number, the front desk, and our firm's help desk. That detail defeated our plan to begin our holiday a little early \"because we can work from the hotel room.\" Think again. No internet service in San Franciso is pretty mind-boggling! We booked this hotel partly because the reviews consistently mention the wonderful staff. And it is true that this hotel is serviced by wonderful staff, without exception. Each person feels like a family member who you really like. The problem is that there are too few of them. Walk into the dining area at any time of day, and no host or hostess is there to greet and seat you. Eventually, someone can be summoned, but . . . death by a thousand cuts again! The TV or radio used by the dining staff competes with the music in the dining room, so every morning one must request that staff choose one or the other, not both. And the single dining room wait staff/host/manager might get in a long conversation with a visiting staff member and forget all about you, jarringly moving the experience from solicitous to abandoned. The food is, however, far superior to the crowded cafe next door, and the room is lovely. Sometimes there is a door man to hail a taxi, sometimes not. The noise outside picks up right at 5:00 a.m. each day, especially if you get a room close to the elevator bank.

But we were amazed \u2013 it did not bother us. And we both hate noise. After a day or two we didn\u2019t hear it, even at night. The area around the hotel felt safe. Not once did we feel threatened or even uncomfortable. Can't say the same for some other parts of SF. And lastly, we want to thank the staff. They were great. Attentive but not overpowering. They were there when we needed them and answered all our questions. The front desk staff were nice and friendly, the concierge was very helpful (get him to organise the car to go to the airport \u2013 it was great) and the maid service was very quick and thorough. Did we have any grumbles? Yes, but they were minor. The windows were dirty (big city grime?) and there was no way to boil water other than for coffee (we drink tea and water boiled in a coffee maker tastes like coffee no matter how much you rinse it). And their TV was a bit ancient - a flat screen would be nice (although there is so much to do in SF that watching TV is not top of mind). We thought their breakfast was average \u2013 they could do better \u2013 so we only tried it once. There are lots of other places to eat nearby. This is a very good good hotel in a great location. It is safe, quiet and leisurely. It was a big part of a vacation we really enjoyed. Thanks Orchard - we will stay again. And thanks San Francisco.

We selected the Orchard as we wanted to be in the center of the city, away from the tourist trap of the wharf and piers. We selected the Orcahrd based off other reviews and after viewing the Hotel's Web site. We booked via hotels.com. Please keep in mind, our review is based off how we travel: we just are after a nice, basic hotel and primarily need a bed, hot shower and bathroom. We don't spend much awake time in a hotel while on vacation. Our room was clean (no bed bugs after inspection), king bed, eletronic safe (that passed the 0000 and 1234 test) and decent sized bathroom. There was no fan in the bathroom and the shower was a tub-based shower with curtain. The grout/caulking was in need for a good scrubbing. Not a deal breaker by any means. The hotel loves to market itself as a 'green or eco' hotel, however the room had no much areas to place plastic bottles, newspapers seperate from the standard trash. Housekeeping may do this, but we made it a point to have those items on the desk with a note asking them to do so. TV was a CRT or non flat screen. Not a big deal for us. The front desk had a DVD collection you could borrow. Oh, no real lobby area if you like to read, drink tea, relax, etc. The room also had a 'sleep CD.' USE IT! Very relaxing and assisted with catching some REM sleep. Speaking of which, this hotel is in a major U.S. city, if you are expecting complete silence, you picked the wrong city to visit. Expect police and fire sirens to happen once or twice a night. Chinatown is two blocks down on Bush. After dropping about $40 (for two) at a nearby diner on morning one, I walked and got a pork steamed bun at a Chinese bakery for $1.10 on morning two. Score. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant. You will find more Walgreen's, Wells Fargo's and Starbucks in this town than anything else. All were within two blocks of the hotel. While more about the city than the hotel, don't support the hobo's. They will be everywhere. (Avoid Market St and the Tenderloin or TL.)

Its a very quaint hotel and it has so much charm. The staff are really friendly and help out where they can. The restaurant attached to the hotel is questionable, we had breakfast the first morning and it was ordinary to say the least, the buffet breakfast ($16) is very basic and put me off, the scrambled eggs look like they had been there from the night before.

My wife and I had a fabulous time staying at the Orchard Hotel. The hotel deserves its high rating. Location Location Location- you're walking minutes away from Union Square, Chinatown and the Westfield shopping centre. The cable car stops right at the intersection of Bush and Powell, so access to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf is easy. My wife and I took a day trip to Sonoma/Napa Valley and the Avis location to pick up a car was just a few blocks from the hotel. Although parking at any hotel is very expensive in San Francisco, this was offset by parking just a block away at the Stockton garage. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. We requested via e-mail a high room and away from Powell Street. We were very pleasantly surprised upon check-in that not only did they acknowledge the request, but that that they were able to accommodate it as well. The bathroom was huge and clean. There is a mini-fridge in the room as well. Also, wi-fi is available in the room, which was important to us as we have a phone that is wi-fi enabled but without a data plan, meaning that we have access to internet and e-mail only via free wi-fi. The front staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The cleaning staff did a fantastic job every day. The doorman, Cornell, was exceptionally professional, courteous and full of great suggestions as to what bus to take, where to eat and where to visit. One of the best things we did while planning our trip to SF was to buy a CityPass. It gave us unlimited use of Muni & Cable Car for 7 days plus admission to the California Academy of Sciences, Blue & Gold Fleet Bay Cruise, Aquarium of the Bay at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and the de Young Museum (which we chose over the Exploratorium). The CityPass is well worth the $69, but a really good tip for you is that if you purchase it directly from alcatrazcruises.com, for the same price you can exchange the Blue & Gold Fleet Bay Cruise for an actual tour of Alcatraz prison. Also, if you want to visit Alcatraz, book it in advance as you will probably not be able to get a ticket if you just show up to the ticket counter. It can sell out several weeks in advance.

Aside from a few minor annoyances (noted below), we had a great time staying here. Pros: Location location - you're blocks away from Union Square and Westfield shopping centre, and there's a street car stop literally outside the hotel. Another bonus for us was the Walgreens a block away, as well as the Starbucks across the street from it. Convenience is a huge plus Staff - all very nice. Front desk clerk cleared up an error that was made with my room rate on my reservation. We were always greeted with a smile and a hello whenever we got out of the elevator, and never had any issues or problems with anyone who worked there. Comfort - rooms were big and spacious, the bed and sheets/pillows were very comfy (many naps were taken after shopping trips) and the bathroom was clean and definitely large enough for both of us to get ready. Cons: Noise - Walls seemed kind of thin, we could hear noises from the room beside ours. Also, there was this strange beeping noise that would constantly go off in the middle of the night. Definitely didn't come from our electronics, seemed like it was the walls or ceilings. Lots of street noise as well, even though we requested a quiet room. Cost of parking - This was almost a dealbreaker for me, it's $45 per 24 hours and that's pretty steep. 4 nights there added $180 to our bill, but what can you do? Overall I would definitely go back. It was nice actually being a few blocks away from Union Square, but close enough to walk down when we wanted to.

The rooms are comfortable, attractive and moderately priced. They use hypoallergenic cleaning products, forbid smoking and meet the standards of chemically sensitive guests like ourselves. While the healthy choice restaurant on the ground floor has never appealed to us, Roxanne's Cafe fourty steps away on the corner at Powell is one of our favorite local places for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The cable car also runs on Powell which provides convenient transportation up and down the big hills when needed. We also like The Orchard's proximity to the Grand Hyatt on Sutter which has a top floor restaurant and bar area providing commanding views of the city and Bay in addition to a good menu. We have many breakfasts there and don't mind the two block walk downhill for a convenient meal in a congenial setting. The Orchard fulfills all the basic comfort requirements admirably (hair dryers, robes and nice marble bathrooms) and the staff is polite and friendly. The suites have TVs in both the bedroom and sitting area which provide nice viewing alternatives. We also make use of the DVD player in the room by bringing a collection of our favorite movies from home since we find the local cable selection a little thin. The Orchard is a competently managed mid-tier hotel and an enjoyable place to stay. In the only incident where we had cause for complaint, the management addressed the problem expeditiously and completely satisfied us with their response. We will undoubtedly stay there again.

I did miss having a fan in the bathroom, and since the windows did not open the whole room would be a little steamy after having two people shower in a row. All in all the room itself is plainly decorated but clean and has most things you would look for - desk, free wireless internet, minibar/fridge, iron and dry cleaning available. We used the room service menu just once to get breakfast. The tab was $50 and our meals were quite small - my husband had a breakfast sandwich and I had a scone, english muffin, fruit and juice. Not worth the money! Also, the lady making up our breakfast trays called our room twice an hour before delivery (7 AM) because she didn't know if she got our order right. Twice! Needless to say, we didn't do that again as there are many better breakfast options nearby the hotel (like Sear's fine foods, just 2 blocks down or Starbucks). As for amenities, we only checked out the DVD library and hit up the front desk/concierge for advice a few times. DVD library was fairly updated with a good range of movies to choose from. There are no movie channels available so it was nice to have that. The front desk staff were always very courteous and helpful, even calling for a last-minute town car for us at 5:30 AM one morning when we forgot to make reservations earlier.

It's also very close to a few good eateries and cafes, Market Street as well as the start of Chinatown. However, if you have mobility problems, it may not be the best for you as it is quite a steep hill to come back up from Market Street/Union Square. The hotel staff were friendly enough and the rooms were a decent size. The King size bed was probably the most comfortable I've ever slept in (including my own at home!) and the big TV worked well. Had a coffee maker in the room (you can to use this to make tea) and the bathroom was nice and big and well stocked with eco-friendly products. Also, unlike many hotels in SF, it has a little laptop in reception for you to check emails etc. for free. The breakfast room doubles for a restaurant and bar, neither of which we utilised as it was a bit lacking in ambience. Now to the few negative points. Firstly, you cannot open the windows, although the air con works fine.....just makes you feel a tad claustrophobic on the odd occassion. The second point was that when we booked, we were to receive breakfast included in the cost of the room. When we arrived we got some vouchers to use each morning, but they were only for 2 pastries and 1 cup of tea or coffee each (although 'pastries' included some rather delicious home made scones and muffins). The breakfast staff seemed a bit miffed when we said that's all we wanted as it was enough to get us out of the door in the morning and we just had brunch later on when we got hungry. Just double check that if your room includes breakfast, what type of breakfast it is! However, probably the most annoying thing on our entire trip to America was the Chinese cleaner lady. For some unknown reason, she felt it necessary to try to clean our room at 8 o'clock every morning while we were either still in bed or in a state of undress! When I told her we didn't want our room cleaned, she still came back later in the day and was very persistent.....even when I put the do not disturb sign out! Got a bit annoying after a day or two. I really don't know why hotels don't offer discounts on your room if you don't want it cleaned while you're there. I was trying to save them money changing towels etc. which for an eco-friendly hotel, I'd have thought they'd appreciate!

The front desk was also very helpful in assisting us with navigating public transportation--like the bus lines, which we used to get to AT&T Park and other areas throughout the city. I'm not sure I understand the negative comments about the staff as we interacted with numerous workers at the front desk. The only reason this hotel didn't get a five star rating is because prior to our stay we spent three nights at a wonderfully, charming inn in Napa and this was just slightly less romantic.

I have been traveling to San Fran for almost a decade and have always stayed at the Maderin Oriental. But after the last several years I had noticed a drastic decline in the level of service at the Manderin, so I decided to try the Orchard. What a great change... I wish I had done it sooner. The reception and service were excellent. The room was spacious and extremely comfortable (I had a larger room with king bed.... there are apparently two sizes of 'regular' rooms, and I would suggest the larger). And the location could not be beat, with easy access to nob hill, union square, chinatown, and many others. Even the immediate surrounding of the hotel was perfect, with great restaurants and bars within feet of the place. The hotel bar was nice, low key, and rarely crowded at all.... with friendly bartenders eager to engage. The overall value of the room was unbeatable for San Fran. There was one rather minor, but annoying, 'con'..... the food. Particularly breakfast. They provide a continental breakfast buffet which was seriously lacking. Stale sliced bread, bland bagels, some limited fruit, and maybe some muffins and scones. It's what you'd expect from one of those horrible Best Western 'free' breakfast, not a nice boutique hotel in San Fran. And while my breakfast was included as part of a promotional deal, I overheard another table complaining that they were charged $14 per person for this \"buffet\". The hotel was even going to charge me for a coffee only (instead they just made my included breakfast). It's those type of meaningless annoying charges things that really turn me off (just raise your room rates by $3/night and give me the coffee for free... it's a huge appearance plus). So breakfast was a disappointment... and I'm not even a big breakfast eater! That being said, I will still return with pleasure to the Orchard Hotel. I look forward to returning in fact. It is a truly exceptional hotel in a great location. I hope they fix the breakfast, which would require little effort. But even if they don't its an easy to walk to one of many nearby restaurants and coffee places open in the morning, so that one failure will not keep me from returning.

The doorman Bob took us up to a room to have a look. Having sussed out the Four Seasons (very good, but would have cost us $1200 per night - for interconnecting rooms), the Westin (had conferences on - and you couldn't get a lift. Waits of 5-15 minutes each time) and a couple of others - the rooms at the Orchard were large, clean and looked a lot more welcoming than what we have seen elsewhere. The bathrooms were large and good quality. As a result we moved accross straight away - initially to just 2 rooms and then changed over to interconnecting rooms the next day - the staff were very helpful (although communication was a bit lacking). In the days that followed we discovered that the location was very good. While not right in Union Square - and those hills in SF are quite demanding - it was right on the Cable Car route - and if you buy a 1 or 3 or 7 day pass - you can jump on the cable cars on the way up (or down) Powell St. For restaurants we generally travelled down Bush St to Chinatown (for Chinese) and nearby alleyways for Italian.

I decided on 3 afer all the years we have stayed here, brought a family reunion once to this hotel and suggested it to other travelers. First off, we have stayed at The Orchard every Thanksgiving and a few other times over the past 8-9 years. The pluses have been the location, the room price (minus the expensive valet), size of rooms and seeing Cornell, a long time exceptional employee every year. The cons we noticed this year were the same furnishings that have been in the rooms for all these years. I think it's time for some replacement pieces do to wear and tear. The bed is long over do for replacement. I have a neurological condition and the springs poking through sent me into a massive flare. I have never had this problem with other hotel beds. There's a staff member operating the breakfast area who could care less he was even employed (I see this mentioned in another review as well). Although the price of the hotel is attractive, they make-up a good portion on parking. I would suggest literally going around the corner and parking for almost 1/2 the price. On our last night, a water pipe broke on our floor around 11pm and it caused massive flooding. The entry way into our room and past the bathroom was soaking wet. I'm sure this was nothing compared to the other damage in the hotel. It looked like there was a good 1\" in the hallway and we were told it flowed from the 9th to the 5th floor. Disasters happen and I feel bad the hotel had to deal with this mess. What was unacceptable was the way they did deal with it. I completely understand the need to get the water up ASAP and make an attempt to dry it before mold infests and mitigate further damage, but the people operating the machines were yelling the entire night. As we layed awake listening to them, they weren't just yelling about the job at hand...they were also yelling idle chit-chat without any regard to the guests in the rooms. Sometime around 7am, I heard one of them yell..\"Well it's time for these people to wake-up.\" I don't think anyone ever slept! If I was the manager of this hotel, I would have bent over backwards to apologize and provide service above and beyond. If I was in charge, I would have provided free coffee to all the guests in the lobby and maybe opened their Continental Breakfast to everyone in the hotel as a way of showing good faith at minimal cost. After our 4 night stay at check-out, we were charged for the last night. Really? You must be kidding? After some negotiation, we were offered a discount on our next stay. NO! Then, it went to 20% off. NO! Then, it went to 50% off. NO! Then finally, the Manager removed the charge for our very long, sleepless night. From the beginning, there should have been NO question that the night would not be charged, not only for us, but for all the guests that endured the brunt of it. The hotel has to have insurance to cover these disasters and loss of revenue, so from a financial standpoint, the charge was senseless. My only hope is they got the place miracously dried out and maybe it will light a fire for some refurbishing.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cThis is the best hotel I have stayed in in years!

The city, and Napa are both really unbelievable! The location of this hotel is fantastic as well, being in the heart of downtown S.F.: close to Union Square, Chinatown, North Beach, the Fisherman's Wharf, etc.! With that being said, there are a few things I would like to tell future travelers to this hotel so they know, before they go: 1) We arrived early in the morning, because of our flight schedule, and while I understand the hotel room was most likely not going to be ready, the reception we received, upon arrival was disappointing. They took my husband's cell phone number and promised to call as soon as our room was available. Hours later, after touring the city on our own, and arriving back to the hotel around 7 PM, and still no phone call from the hotel, the lady at the front desk proceeded to talk over my husband while he tried to find out why a phone call was never made to us. We took that as a sign that they prefer not to answer any questions about their service, but rather talk over us instead. That was just the beginning of the mediocre service of this hotel. 2) Upon entering our room to freshen up, from our morning travels and day excursions in the city, I found the toilet to be in not working order. Luckily, it was a simple matter of lifting the cover of the tank, moving things around the inner workings of the tank, and making the toilet work, that we did not need to call for further hotel assistance-thanks to my husband's knowledge of how toilets function, because if it were just myself in the room, I would have been calling downstairs, requesting help in a heartbeat! 3) While I applaud the efforts that this is a \"green\" hotel, and part of the L.E.E.D hotel chains, they really need to decide what they want you to enjoy, as far as basic amenities are concerned. For example, I would consider myself a fast shower-taker, as well as my husband, and yet, in the morning (or even in the evening for that matter), we would find ourselves with no hot water to take a shower. While, on occasion, he or I (depending on who went in first) would find that turning the handle to the extreme hot side would, on a whim, give the 1st person lukewarm water for the first 15-30 seconds of a 3-minute long shower (that's even a little too quick for either of us, but trust me, you wouldn't want to stay in there any longer than necessary either). I gave up on even hoping for warm water by the 3rd and final morning we were there, and just dealt with taking an ice-cold shower. While some people may enjoy an invigoratingly cold shower, I am not one of those people. 4) On the 2nd night of our stay, we decided to stop into the hotel's restaurant, Daffodil's, and grab a dessert to eat in our room, after enjoying a nice dinner in the city. Much to our further disappointment, my husband's flour-less chocolate cake was not only extremely dry, but tasted as if they had made it a week prior, and were still trying to pass it off as if it were made fresh that morning. The \"homemade\" trio of ice cream (caramel, strawberry and oatmeal cookie-a strange combination, in my opinion, but the caramel flavor was really and truly the only enjoyable and seemingly fresh tasting one of the 3) were scooped out with a tiny melon baller, to which the hotel had the nerve to charge $8 for each lousy dessert. 5) We decided it was unfair to give the hotel restaurant only 1 shot at proving themselves to be a good restaurant, so we went down for breakfast the following morning. When the waiter finally came over to ask if we would like anything to drink, we both ordered coffee, and when they came, the waiter did not bring any milk for the coffee, which seems like a standard in most places, but OK, a small oversight, no big deal. They have a small \"buffet\" for $14/person, or you can order a la carte from their somewhat limited breakfast menu. If you're expecting eggs, waffles, pancakes, etc., included in the buffet-style breakfast, you'll have to rethink your idea of a breakfast buffet. I will admit, they did have eggs on the table, but they were hard-boiled and cold-no scrambled eggs in sight! Also no pancakes or waffles either. They had 3 different types of mini bagels with a selection of plain or chive cream cheese, butter, and 2 different types of jam. They also had 1 type of mini scone and croissant, as well as a choice of white or wheat bread. They had a small selection of pre-sliced fruits that did not look appetizing, at all, and a choice of granola or another dry cereal, accompanied with plain yogurt or milk. There were also no plates anywhere in sight. There were only large and small bowls. I guess the hotel seems to think people enjoy eating bagels in a bowl! We were there to witness more people come in for breakfast, and plates were never placed on the table. But that's just a knit-picky observation of mine. To me, it was more of a continental style breakfast, but I ordered the \"buffet\" anyway, and asked for 2 eggs over medium, at an additional a la carte price of $2. They did manage to bring my eggs on a plate (if you could call it that)-a super thin oval-shaped plate, that barely had room for my 2 eggs, and an orange slice, for decoration, but in a conscious effort to be green and not have to clean big plates in the wash, I can appreciate the gesture. What I can't overlook is the fact that the waiter only came back once to check and see if we needed a coffee refill, which we did, but also I had been needing a glass of ice water, but never had the opportunity to get his attention to request a glass, until he finally showed back up to our table, towards the end of our meal, to ask about the coffee. But, in the end, he did manage to bring both of us a glass of water, and our coffee refills, so I can't say that our needs were NEVER met, they were just not met in a timely manner. 6) I really don't like writing so many negatives without also giving the positives, and truly there were 2 REALLY great things about this hotel: First, the location. Hands down, incredible!! We could walk everywhere and see and do so many different things all within a 30-minute (max) walk! And secondly, the beds. We slept like babies every night! The hotel was in a quiet area, and the beds were extremely comfortable! Well done with the mattress, pillow, and comforter selections. :o) All-in-all, while this may seem like a negative review, I simply want everyone to understand that if you want a fantastic location and a great night's sleep, this is your hotel! While I don't know how much it cost, since it was a birthday present from my husband, for your money, I would consider looking up reviews for other hotels in the area and comparing other peoples thoughts and recommendations about the service and quality of another hotel. I am very big about quality of service and I was left with a very bad taste in my mouth about the quality of the front desk staff, as well as, in the restaurant. There was a very helpful and friendly doorman/concierge man who, unfortunately I never got his name, but he was great and I hope the hotel recognizes what a great employee they have in him. He recommended places to go eat, arranged our airport shuttle for us, and even accompanied me, and helped me learn the tricks-of-the-trade with the ice machine on our floor that was giving me difficulty earlier in the day. That reminds me: another tip for the hotel, if you plan to go to Napa and by white wines and want to chill them in your room, they only have ice machines on levels 3, 6 and 9 (of a 10-floor hotel). So if you don't mind going on the elevator to another floor to get ice, don't worry about what floor you'll be on. :o) Also make sure to ask ahead what kind of room view you'll have. Unfortunately we were on the inner side of the hotel, facing another hotel, with no city view in sight. Again, I don't know the price of the hotel, and I'm sure there are cheaper and more expensive hotels around the same area, but the location was perfect, and even a lack of quality service couldn't ruin our weekend in San Francisco, because being there with my husband made the trip absolutely perfect anyway! :o)", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat loacation, Great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "iva_van", "ReviewID": "UR74239173", "Content": "We stayed for two nights.

There are plenty of places to get a quick bite around the hotel, so we did not eat in the restaurant. We had breakfast at Lori's Diner just around the corner and it was great (we did not want to wait in the line for Sear's and I have no regrets that we didn't).

(said taxis would not respond to calls); we had no problem booking one ourselves for next-day pick-up over the phone. Ended walking all the way to the Orpheum, since it was difficult to flag one on the street.

Bathroom was impecable, with plenty of towels and toiletry. Staff was non-obtrusive. I enjoyed the bed. Thought is was quite comfortable and had a great night sleep. My companion found it too soft for a bad back. Only issue I had related to the locked controls for the AC. Was set at 75F, and I prefer thermostat around 70F.

Neither of us had been to SanFran and we both decided just to go see it. We didn't want to stay in one of the big chains so we decided on the Orchard based on reviews and location. For us, we were thoroughly pleased with this hotel. Not sure what others were expecting from a 3-star hotel, but this one met our expectations just fine. We arrived early -- several hours before the check in time -- but were taken directly to our room. We had a room with two oversized twin beds. While our \"view\" was not all that great, that did not concern us since we only came back to the room to sleep. The beds were comfortable & the room was clean. After the first night, I discovered that the bed frame platform was broken which caused the mattress to sink a bit in the middle. I spoke to Marissa at the front desk the next morning and when we returned that evening, the bed frame was fixed. All the front desk personnel were friendly and helpful. We did not eat in the hotel as it seemed a bit expensive to us but there were plenty of options near by. Our favorite for breakfast and late evening dessert crepes was the Cable Car Cafe...jusr around the corner and down 1/2 block on Powell street. Reasonable prices, good food, and the owner was simply delightful. The last few days of our weeklong trip, he would provide us \"extras\" at no charge....a cup of fruit...a bowl of ice cream, etc. We also tried Uncle Vitos and would say it was OK. The Orchard's location was outstanding. We did not have a car but we had no trouble getting anywhere in the city. While the Cable Cars were pretty crowded in the evenings, we figured out ways to avoid the crowds and usually got on without a problem. I would recommend purchasing a 7-day pass for the public transit system for $26 which is an outstanding buy and permits you to ride the buses, cable cars and trolleys. Other reviewers mentioned the homeless people being very agressive.....we did not find that to be the case. Homeless people congregate in all large cities and SanFran is no exception. However, most that we encountered simply asked for a handout and when we passed them by, they didn't say or do anything more. My experience has always been ... \"you get back what you give out.\" When you \"ask nicely\" (not demand) and are appreciative of others, most people will return your kindness. Oh....and one last recommendation on things to do. Go down to the Wharf area on Hyde Street and rent a Go-Car! www.gocartours.com Drive the GPS guided tour of the city in a 3-wheel scooter/car. If you can imagine two old ladies zipping around town in one of these things, it was a hoot. The most fun I've had in a long time.

First off I must note that this is a three star hotel. We stayed here because of the reviews on Trip Advisor which have never let us down, until now. This hotel ranked as number 3? Check in was simple and easy but the 3:00 pm check in is strictly enforced. We asked for a high floor that was quiet. We were given room 906 which is high but NOT quiet. There were garbage trucks dumping bins three nights at 2:30 am loud and clear along with slamming doors at all hours of the night. We had to ask for a portable fan to run all night to try and cover up the noise. I realize that all hotels have some noise but this is #3 on Trip Advisor and is not expected. It takes very little money to have soft closures installed on all the room doors to stop the SLAM at all hours of the night and this is not dependant on the star rating in any way. Three days there was no hot water for the second person who wanted to shower. We stay in hotels in India that have more hot water than this one. We went to eat at the restaurant at 8:30 pm on Sunday and were told the kitchen was closing at 9:00 pm and besides, \u201cThey were out of most things anyway\u201d. When we finally did try this restaurant the wine glasses were very dirty and even the ones they brought to us after we complained, were dirty. Is this not #3 on Trip Advisor. The \u201cgym\u201d is as mentioned previously by other reviewers, has three machines which are very low cost machines. Our home machines are better quality than the ones on offer. To make up for this the hotel offers guests a \u201cdeal\u201d on a nearby fitness centre for only $15 each a day!!! The good points: The staff was very good! All were classy and professional. Temperature control in the room worked well and the room itself was clean and well kept. As well the bed was quite comfortable. We asked quite a few people who work and live in the area what the best food was and were told it is a must to eat at Uncle Vito\u2019s pizza. We did and it was average pizza. Location is good if you want to shop. The homeless are all around and are very aggressive. They swear, yell and follow you if you turn them down. The famed Tenderloin is only four blocks away so it is not hard to see why the homeless are plentiful. I can\u2019t stress this point enough. 20-30 people a day will ask you for money and 50% of them will cuss at you if you refuse. In summary this area is not a nice place to visit. We were told by many people not to go too far this way or that due to the \u201cdanger\u201d in all directions at night. Even in the daytime the beggars are nasty! The wharf is a nice place to go as the beggars are a little fewer there but beware late at night. We closed a blues club around midnight and it was very doggy trying to get to the tram. It actually reminded us of Mexico City at night! Perhaps we are just used to a better class of hotel but there were deficiencies in the Orchard that are not acceptable in any star rating!

Business users beware, as the hotel will pass you off onto the WiFi Guys tech support (i.e. \"not the hotel's problem\") - surely it's the hotel manager's job to resolve this, not the customers job to spend 30 minutes in a call centre queue reporting the problem? -Water takes a long time to warm up in the mornings and shower is quite weak (floor 7) -Noise from next room *if you have adjoining doors*, avoid those rooms, as otherwise the noise suppression is pretty good. -Breakfast was lowish-quality & the staff at the breakfast sitting were truly miserable and surly, when they bothered to make an appearance.

The shampoos that they give you now are not quite to par, there now is only 1 soap given (hello, needs for hands and body!). The plush bathrobes are still in the closet - yay! No longer is a complimentary continental breakfast served (or maybe it only is during the week and not on weekends). Also, the wireless Internet connection in any part of the hotel (including the lobby) is either Low or Very Low. This has been consistent over the past few years. Ask for the cable to plug into the wall at your desk if you're going to be using your laptop. Also ask for a high level room or one in the back of the hotel. The hotel is located at Bush and Powell which means you are hearing the cable cars until midnight and stating early in the morning. Overnight parking is $40 - not to be surprised at since this is San Francisco. Union Square is within walking distance - do not underestimate the big hill on the way back (going uphill when returning from Union Square). Free DVD rentals from their collection at the front desk (maybe about 100 to choose from). Overall I will continue to stay at The Orchard.

I have to say the hilly location didn't bother us at all. Happily recommend it. Other notes about San Fran: If you plan on using the public transport you can buy 1 day ($13) and 3 day ($20) passes. Considering a single journey on the cable car is $5, then this is worthwhile. It is also valid on the metro, buses etc. You can buy these passes from Walgreens which is just round the corner from the hotel. If the weather is nice a bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge is fab. We used Blazing Saddles - not impressed with their bikes so maybe shop around before you choose.

They have a library of DVD's down at the front desk, but my advise is to get there early as most of the newest releases were taken after dinner. Viewing a DVD can be a little tricky as the remote flips open to reveal a hidden keypad to operate the DVD player. Ask the front desk and they will be happy to help you if you have trouble. The bathroom was clean with a large shower (no bath for our room). We didn't eat at hotel as there are a lot of great restaurants within walking distance from the hotel.

The location was absolutely brilliant and easy to get to. If you are catching the BART (train system) from either airport (SFO or OAK) get off at the union square station and exit to powell st. This is sooo much cheaper than a taxi and really easy to do. When you get out of the station however, you may want to grab a cab up the hill to the hotel. The hotel is only a few blocks up powell st, on the corner of powell and bush st, however there is a steep portion at the top (totally walkable usually, but with two heavy bags it was easier to get a taxi). On arrival to the hotel we were greated very warmly and check in was quick and easy. They provided information to us, such as the free DVDS available to watch, the free computer and printer in the lobby for use any time, etc etc. We requested a high level room away from the elevators and were given one on the 4th floor, away from elevators. We checked in early, around 10am, so it was great that it was ready for us then. The room was beautifully decorated in calm tones with great prints of the local area. A decent sized room, with a bay window area with work desk and chair which made for a cosy work area. The bed was comfortable, however sheets didn't seem to fit very well. Bathroom was a great size and nicely tiled with sophisticated details. Water pressure was brilliant, something I always look out for, and hot water was perfect and consistent throughout the whole stay. We had a connecting room and could hear the loud people in the room connecting, also could often hear people in the hallways and the doors slamming through out the day and night. This is usually unavoidable in most hotels though, it just seemed a little louder here, but may be because of the boutique building. Noise from the street was minimal, however there was also a constant high pitch ringing sound that never went away - it took us a long time to figure out that it was the fridge!! Could be very annoying to those sensitive to sound. Parking seemed expensive at $40 per night, but why you would have a car in SF i don't know - all the one ways streets and so many public transport options to get around instead! Free wi-fi in the rooms worked perfectly the whole time. Over all, the stay was lovely. The service wonderful - turn down service each day, staff always asked if there was anything they could help you with, etc. and location really can't be beat - I looked at many hotels when chosing which one to stay at in SF and am glad we chose this one at union square, in amongst the lights at christmas time and shopping and lots of transport options, instead of down at fisherman's wharf, which was very touristy and not that much to do really - would have hated being in a hotel down there.", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winter Haven, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value, comfort and friendly.\u201d", "Author": "Joedolson", "ReviewID": "UR50974991", "Content": "The Orchards was excellent.

This was our second visit (the first was about a year ago) and we'll definitely be back next year for our annual mother-daughter trip to SF. So the details in no particular order: - The hotel is 20 minute BART ride from the SF airport and then a quick 5 minute cab ride up Powell (and I do mean up...the hill near the hotel is much too steep for pulling on luggage). Don't make the mistake of taking the cable car up to the hotel because the line is too long and the ride is crowded, especially with luggage (but do ride the cable car at least once on your trip...it's fun). - It's a smallish hotel, so check-in was quick and easy. - Space is a premium in most of SF, so they provide two oversized twin (\"three-quarter\") beds in the double rooms instead of two full- or queen-sized beds. We honestly didn't notice much difference because they were VERY comfortable and still quite roomy. - We were given one of the wheelchair accessible rooms again, which had its pros (better view of the city from a larger room in the corner) and one con (awkward hand-held shower with low water pressure). - Unlike our first visit, we had some difficulty setting up the free wi-fi this time around, but a somewhat lengthy and involved call to the help desk got us up and running. - We didn't order room service or eat at the lovely-looking restaurant, but there are decent enough restaurants within walking distance in Chinatown and the Financial District. -The hotel doesn't have a vending machine, but there is a slightly overpriced neighborhood convenience store about a half block away if you crave snacks (the minibar in the room was locked and we didin't request the key). - On our last night, some guest(s) starting smoking somewhere near our room (it's a non-smoking hotel), and the smell came into our room through the vent. I guess other guests also noticed this because when I called to complain, the front desk said they were aware of the problem and that security was working to catch whoever it was. It was definitely a mar to an otherwise nice stay, but the smell dissipated within about an hour and we were able to fall back asleep. - The doormen were super friendly and helpful, giving good restaurant recommendations, getting cabs for us, helping with luggage, etc. - Cabs sometimes confused The Orchard Hotel with The Orchard Garden Hotel, so be sure that you know the address or intersection.

On arrival we were told that some guests had not booked out of their rooms and there was no availability for us, and as a result they had arranged for us to stay one night at the Club Quarters and they would refund us the cost of one night's stay in compensation for the inconvenience. There was not a lot that could be done about the situation although it was fairly annoying as we had chosen the Orchard for its proximity to Union Square and Club Quarters is in the Financial District. Upon checking in to the Club Quarters we were given a tiny room with a queen bed, - apparently CQ does not have rooms with two beds or so they claim. This was certainly the smallest hotel room I have stayed in and the bathroom was similarly minute. The following day around 2.30 pm we duly turned up at the Orchard to check in, to be told that rooms were still being made up. When eventually we got a room, the wireless internet did not work. After spending half an hour talking to the wireless service provider without any solution, I then found that the issue was due to our room being too far from the wireless node for a strong enough signal to be detected by the laptop. Some time later another network was set up which worked. On checking out of the hotel, I enquired as to how the refund for the first night's stay was going to be made as I had booked through a travel web site and pre-paid. I was then told that no refund would be forthcoming as I had booked online and that was that. Needless to say I was less than amused that they had reneged on their word. We also had a maid come barging in to our room despite there being a Do Not Disturb sign hung on the doorknob. She wanted to check the minibar fridge and when I said we had not used anything she then left, grumbling away in her dialect. Putting all those issues aside, I would say that the staff are not overly friendly, the service (what little we saw of it) was average, the room, furnishings, TV and bathroom were dated.

We booked based on the reviews here and we weren't disappointed. It was our first visit to San Fran and found it quite hard to get our bearings after catching the BART, but eventually got where we needed to be. The hotel is in an excellent location, just about 2 blocks from Union Square (Go to the cheesecake factory for lunch - in our opinion, the best value meals), and literally on the corner of the cable car stop. China town is 5 minutes walk away, and so too is the Westfield shopping centre. Our room was very big and had a very large bathroom. We couldn't fault anything. It was very clean and housekeeping did an excellent job. The bed was huge (compared to our standard double back home!) and was actually the comfiest bed I've ever slept in! We stayed on a room only basis so didn't get the breakfast option, however, we ate in Roxanne's (on the corner, next to the hotel) and in the Cable Car Cafe (on Powell street, almost opposite to the entrance to Roxanne's). The cable car cafe was very good value for money - Bagels, crepes and healthier options were very good. Reception staff were always very friendly and the concierges were brilliant - we asked for restaurant recommendations a couple of times and they were spot on. (For excellent Pizzas you have to visit Uncle Vitos, opposite corner of the intersection - it doesn't look too inviting, but is the best pizza we've ever tasted). Wireless internet is free and more than adequate for our needs. There's also a laptop in reception and you can print for a modest fee (handy if you want to check-in online and print your boarding passes). If you want to travel about a bit the cable car works well but can be very busy with tourists. We found it easy enough to use our 7 day muni pass and caught the buses and F-line wherever we wanted to go. We could sit here and sing the praises of this hotel all day, but that would make this review too long and boring! In short, if you want a great hotel, in a great location, with great staff then this should be your first choice.

The hotel staff are really friendly and helpful and there is 1 computer at reception you can use for internet, emails and to print boarding passes. There are loads of restaurants nearby - Scala at the Francis Drake hotel for a posh meal and Louis Dinner for breakfast which is on Powell Street just one block down. There is a nice coffee shop at the corner of Powell and California (Illy coffee) if you fancy a light breakfast. We got the BART to Powell Street and walked from there (less than 10 mins) Montogomery Bart is not quite as near but the area is a slightly nicer one to come out into.There is a steep walk whichever option you choose!

We picked the Orchard Hotel based on the reviews that we read and this is one time when everyone got it right. From the moment that we checked in we knew we had made a great choice in the Orchard. The location was wonderful. The cable car stopped on the corner and Union Square was 3 blocks behind the hotel down the hill. You couldn't beat the location. The room was clean and spacious and had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay. There were robes hanging in the closet, a safe, good quality toiletries, nice soft towels and a very comfortable bed waiting on us. The refrigerator was stocked but if you used anything there was a charge. We just walked down the street to a liquor store and stocked up on soda, water, etc and put our stuff in the refrigerator. Each time that my husband and I went out or came back in we were greeted by the staff by our name which was nice. The staff made it a point to always ask if we were okay, if we needed anything or if we needed directions, suggestions for eating, tours, etc. The hotel has a restuarant, The Daffodil. I can't rate the restaurant since we didn't eat there but it was beautiful on the inside and there were always people eating there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The price for this hotel was very competitive and we received a first timer's discount. I know that everyone has different experiences but I could never rate this hotel the way I did if I didn't have such a good experience here.

With the streetcar located literally 10 seconds away from the hotel entrance you have easy access to the city. I would definitely stay here again.

The buffet ($14) offers a rather poor selection, only cold stuff and no ham or cheese except for Philadelphia.

We stayed at the Orchard Hotel for 7 days for $741 USD, which for the location was amazing but it was also a clean, bright and spacious hotel with everything anyone on vacation could possibly need and free Wi-Fi to boot! The hotel is at the corner of Powell on Bush St. and you\u2019ve got the Cable Car right outside the front doors, which was great because the hills are plenty in the area! From Powell, the cable car will either take you to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf or to Market Street. The California Cable Car line isn\u2019t but a couple of blocks away while Chinatown is a short walk as is Union Square! The BART ride ($5.35) from the Airport brings you to Market and Powell Street and we walked up Powell to Bush. There is one big hill to walk up but it is doable even with luggage! We could have taken the Cable Car up but I\u2019m not sure how they feel about luggage\u2026? We had an interior room on the 6th floor, which had a view of the buildings next door...not great but we weren\u2019t in San Fran for the room. We had a huge King size Bed which was unbelievably comfortable, and a really nice size bathroom with nice calming scented shampoos, body wash, conditioner and lotion\u2026it was like being in a spa every time you showered! They also provide a one-cup coffee maker with coffee (reg. & decaf), green tea and regular tea pods. We used the coffee maker once, the coffee was okay but it was mostly because there was a Starbucks one block away. There\u2019s a mini bar with some snacks not too badly priced, $5 for a good size bag of chips or\u2026$20 for a one-person size bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon\u2026. Walgreen\u2019s is down a couple of blocks and a corner store selling full size bottles of wine for reasonable prices if you\u2019re looking for those kinds of snacks. Check-in took all of 3 minutes and up to our room we went. The towels in the room are ticker than your average hotel towel and they provided us with two robes\u2026nice touch!! We brought our laptop and the hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi always had an excellent connection! Without hesitation, I would recommend (and have already) this hotel to anyone!

After dropping by a couple of hotels in Fishermans Wharf and Union Square, prices seemed to be a bit on the steep side so we popped into a Starbucks and got online to try and find a deal. Without checking tripadvisor and having only driven past The Orchard we found a fantastic deal for only $91 a night, we booked for four nights and hoped we had done the right thing. We arrived at the hotel roughly 20 minutes later and were greated by the incredible nice and friendly front desk staff. The room they gave us overlooked Bush Street (the main entrance to the hotel) and was fantastic. Lovely and spacious, very clean and had everything you needed. We were very, very pleased. The location is great and we felt perfectly safe there, you can easily walk straight to Union Square and you are right on Powell street and the cable car stops right outside. The further away from Union Square you get the more homeless people you do encounter but that is to be expected from a major city however we never once felt uncomfortable. The hotel has valet parking but we parked at the car park on Stockton street which was a lot cheaper and didn't have any problems. The hotel does do an express breakfast for $5 which includes either toast, bagel or croissant and tea/coffee. However we went to Loris Diner which was just down the road and was great. I would definitly recommend staying at this hotel and would advise anyone to book online as they seemed to have various special offers. The DVD's they have for you to borrow at reception is pretty vast and they had quite a few new releases which was nice.

The housekeeping and the front desk staff is very polite and always greet you with a smile. The toilets are large and the rooms have a well stocked minibar with a coffee maker, iron and ironing board. They have a nice restaurant which I never tried though. The hotel seems perfect for a single business traveller like me, being in the heart of downtown San Francisco and most of the places were walking distance. I did not find any serious flaws with the hotel.

The hotel staff did not do much to help on this but forwarded me the phone no. of the wi-fi company, Those guys were really helpful but the wi-fi hardly worked and I had to depend on the cable. -I had an extra guest for a night and when I asked the hotel to accomodate him in my room they said they cannot as the rooms were not equipped to do so. They don't mention this on their confirmation and infact mention that they charge $25 for an extra person. But, they did not allow me to have an extra person and I had to arrange for alternate accomodation for my guest. -I never ate the restaurant as I felt it was over-priced and as it was not a 5 star hotel i dont think they should have such high rates. I would have liked a microwave in the room which would have been of a great help as I was there for a week.

The bed was large and very comfy, the bathroom was clean and spacious and featured lovely bath products and fluffy towels, and the staff was helpful and courteous. The decor is a kind of Art Deco theme so do not expect a boutique hotel with stark, minimalist style. The hotel is located just steps from the Powell St. cable car and a few minutes' walk to the BART and MUNI stations (the two public transit systems serving the city). It is also within easy walking distance to many attractions, cafes and restaurants, yet it's not in a noisy area. We didn't try the restaurant so I can't comment on that. The staff let us print up our e-tickets for the Alcatraz tour using the laptop and printer in the lobby at no charge which was much appreciated. They also were happy to give directions whenever asked. Having free Internet access was great as were able to get info on attractions and easily find out how to get around town using the MUNI web site. The free DVD library is also a nice touch though we ended up having no time to watch any movies. One minor negative point is that if your room faces the back alley you will probably hear garbage trucks going by in the early morning if you are a light sleeper, but this is pretty normal for a downtown hotel. They're not extremely loud but are audible. Our minibar fridge seemed to buzz quite a bit the first night but the noise seemed to disappear after that. Another small thing that was somewhat annoying is that our card-keys for the room failed to work on more than one occasion. On two occasions we had to go back down to the lobby twice to remedy the situation (on each occasion they sent us back upstairs assuring us the key would now work and it still did not). Again, this is not the end of the world but something that I hope will be remedied.

The staff are polite and very helpful - they were great when we asked for a Napa or Sonoma vineyard suggestion, looking up addresses and writing down information. The only small downside was the cost of the valet parking - at $45 per day it worked out expensive picking the car up from the airport.

We were certainly not disappointed! Staff were friendly, right from the initial welcome, and able to advise on things like what bus to catch to the Golden Gate bridge. The requests we made at the time of booking were met. Location - near the intersection of Bush & Powell Streets, convenient for Union Square shops, cable cars, Chinatown, and easy to get to just about everywhere else. A safe area, with enough places to eat nearby. Facilities - a moderately sized hotel, with 10 floors but only about 12 rooms on each floor. Elevators always arrived promptly. Ice machines are on every third floor, but hidden away behind doors so you may need to ask at reception where they are. There is a laptop at reception for customer use, useful for checking emails, checking in for return flights, etc. Room - the hotel met our request for a high floor and there was no external or internal noise. Also the room did not face onto the street. A good size room with plenty of places to put things. A very comfortable king size bed. Air conditioning was quiet and could be adjusted for the desired temperature. En-suite bathroom with bath/shower - not a big bath but I hate it when a hotel only offers you a shower! The worst thing I can say about the room is that the plug in the washbasin allowed water to slowly trickle out. Breakfast - choice of a la carte or buffet. The buffet selection was rather limited (only one type of meat, for example) and the price was much the same as for a la carte so we went for the menu choice. I recommend the salmon. Typical cost 15-20 dollars. Dinner - we only ate in on the first night, preferring to sample what was on offer in the area. Good, but not a wide menu selection. Price - we booked through Expedia who were doing a special room rate of 143.30 UK pounds per night including all taxes etc, but excluding breakfast. Certainly worth it at this price. That was back in the summer when you got 2 dollars to the pound - happy days! Conclusion - would we choose this hotel again if we returned to San Francisco? Definitely we would - at the right price! Eating out tip - try the various European cuisines in Belden Place, which connects Bush St and Pine St (between Kearny & Montgomery). Plenty of choice, plus the chance to eat out of doors (with heaters when it gets a bit chilly), and you might even end up talking to your neighbour! Oh, and this city certainly takes its wine seriously, with just about everywhere offering a wide range of Californian and other wines. Transport tip - a MUNI passport covers buses and cable cars and is good value, especially if you intend to ride the cable cars a lot as they cost 5 dollars a time otherwise. 1-day & 3-day passports can be bought at Walgreen's about a block from the hotel towards Union Square. For a 7-day passport costing 24 dollars go to the booth that sells theatre tickets on Union Square.", "Date": "November 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cgreat place, super location\u201d", "Author": "Garak", "ReviewID": "UR21651220", "Content": "We stayed there for two nights and really liked the place.

There was hair on the doorframe and the walls, and the ceiling was quite discusting. When taking a hot shower there will always be small particles of fat from the skin that stick to the vapour. The fat will deposit on the ceiling and create spots. I informed the front desk about the problem but the problem remained when we left the hotel. The lights on both sides of the mirror were also full of dust. I think it was not solved due to lack of cleaning standards. The person responsible for cleaning the bathroom obviously did not understand the nature of the problem and could not choose the appropriate solution. My point is this; when there is a complaint about the cleanliness of a bathroom, the responsible manager should take immediate action and take a look in detail.

The staff was super friendly and always asked us if we needed any assistance, the rooms were very clean and big, as was the bathroom. The bartender/waiter in their bar was friendly, polite and always at our service...the happy hour $3 lemon-drop martinis were a great hit after a long day of walking. We got a great deal through Expedia and I can say that we have stayed at far more expensive hotels with far less service and smaller rooms...they even come in and turn your bed down in the late afternoon. Their lobby may be a bit small but who cares I don't stay in hotel lobbies, I stay in hotel rooms and that's where this hotel shines. Also, it is extremely well located, a quick walk to Union Square, the cable care stops right beside the hotel (BTW we didn't hear any cable car noise from our room) and the cable cars take you right down to Fisherman's Wharf, or China Town, or Little Italy.

We purchased groceries outside of San Fran (we came from Sonora) and brought them to the hotel. We got the key for the refrigerator and emptied out the hotel's pricey contents and put them in a box that the hotel provided so we could put our own food in the fridge instead. That way we were able to eat our breakfasts and lunches without having to pay restaurant prices! At the end of our 3-day stay we put everything from the hotel stock back into the refrigerator and locked it up and returned the key. Worked out great, and the hotel staff helped us keep on our budget without our feeling cheap! We parked our car at a garage just 3 blocks down from the hotel, so we were able to save a bit by not using the valet parking of the hotel. It saved us about $12 each day, which adds up! The people working at the Orchard were extremely helpful and friendly. The doormen were exceptionally nice and willing to help in whatever way they could. The front desk staff was great, too. We tried to tip the maids and doormen for their services and they seemed very appreciative, not like they just expected it. The king sized bed we had was SOOOOOOO comfortable. The comforter on top and the 100% Egyptian cotton sheets were wonderful after a long day of walking around S.F. We also enjoyed watching movies using the free DVDs from the front desk and the DVD player in the room. The Azur brand lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner made us feel pampered and smelled so good. We requested that the maid leave some extra and left her a tip, and we were delighted to have a few extra! The large bathroom allowed us to spread out and added to the luxurious atmosphere. The location is excellent. Close to China town, a cable car line, Union Square, etc. The Golden Gate bridge is a short drive away, too. One caution: My knees had serious problems with the incredibly steep streets, even with excellent walking shoes. Take the public transportation whenever possible, and save your legs for seeing the sights! The only downside was our view. We requested a high floor, which they granted. But our \"view\" was of the top of another building, and other buildings beyond. The location was quiet, however.

Dinner in the hotel's restaurant, Daffodil's, was only so-so however; husband's flatiron steak was superb, but my pork tenderloin entree was dry and tasteless, very overcooked. The waitress said the chef prefers to serve the pork rare, probably because he has never heard of trichinosis and has no idea how easy it is to cook a pork tenderloin to non-pink, tender perfection. Whatever, I suggest you select something else from what seemed to be a relatively limited, somewhat precocious menu. Be aware that there are tiny, easily overlooked coupons at the far end of the reception desk that knock $20 off your dinner bill.

The European-style breakfast buffet was more than adequate and included juices, cold cuts, cheese, tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, assorted cereals (with yogurt available), a variety of fruit, delicious croissants and muffins, bread and bagels for toasting, teas, coffee, and so on. Hot breakfasts were available at an extra charge. We had the San Francisco Chronicle outside our door every morning, and both USA Today and the Wall Street Journal were also complimentary at the front desk. The room had free wireless, and the bathroom was large and well appointed with good linens. Shower/Tub was clean with excellent water pressure. Little noise transferred from adjacent rooms. The in-room coffee was not memorable. Elevators were prompt and swift. The beds are cloud-like, almost too much so. After an uncomfortably hot first night alternating between the too hot duvet and too cold sheet as a cover, we requested a regular blanket rather than the fluffy duvet -- problem solved. The huge pillows are deep and fluffy, nice if that's want you like but miserable if you prefer something smaller and firmer. A selection of pillows amid the six on the bed would have been much appreciated. The decor is very tailored with extremely nice furnishings, and the staff was highly professional and pleasant. All in all, the Orchard proved to be ideal for our all-too-short stay in SF.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThis is a great find - thanks to Trip Advisor\u201d", "Author": "Sww52", "ReviewID": "UR16711073", "Content": "I think all the other posts covered the good points but we we booked 4 rooms for May 16-18 and were very pleased with our selection.

The position of the hotel is good being close to Union Square. We stayed in one of the King suites which had a lounge and separate bedroom. The room was comfortable and clean with plenty of room for us all. We had a few glitches on our arrival which got things off to a less than ideal start but nothing too dramatic. As we had a 2 year old, we requested a cot (or crib or \"play-pen\" as they call them in the States) to be in our room. Unfortunately, on our arrival (after a 12 hour flight) our now asleep baby had no cot. The first that arrived was broken but the 2nd worked fine. Then we couldn't get into the fridge because it had a lock on it! I have never stayed in hotel with a lock on the fridge.. it seemed a little odd. The lock was broken and the fridge could not be opened. This was fixed quickly which was good because my needed to keep her insulin cool. Then when we tried to use the coffee machine in the room, it belched out rotten smelling hot water with chunks of God knows what in it and eventually got a replacement (after staff intially telling us that was normal for those machines!). However, all the above was minor and not that much of a big deal and I only mention it here as all the other hotels we stayed in during our 1 month away had cots ready in the rooms, usable fridges and clean tea/coffee making fascilities. The biggest disappointment about our stay was at breakfast. We paid for a \"breakfast included\" package and for the most part the breakfast itself was ok... nothing startling (again compared to our other hotels) but good enough. We effectively served ourselves with little help from the two fairly sour looking staff on each morning. In fact, the male staff member serving made us feel quite unwelcome and seemed reluctant to be there or help. Now, tipping is not the custom in our country although i do understand it is big in the States and for the most part we follow that custom when in the USA . However, I expect good and pleasant service before forking out extra cash for a tip and if staff are off-hand, rude or make you fell generally unwelcome, then I don't think a tip is deserved. Due to the sour service received, we did not leave a tip on the first two mornings and one that second morning the male staff member gave me a lecture about tipping him. This was a surpirse and extremely rude. Although we had already paid for breakfast for the next two mornings, we did not eat at the hotel as I did not wish to feel pressured to pay extra (i.e. tip) for poor service or risk some form of retribution if we did not tip him from then on. In summary, the hotel was a pretty nice and convenient place to stay (with a few glitches intially but not too big a deal). However, definitely do not pre-pay for breakfast. You will eat a lot better elsewhere for less and get much better service (the pancake place around the corner was good for breakfast and Uncle Vito's do good pizza for dinner)", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "moritzchicago", "ReviewID": "UR16395022", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights at this hotel.

I wanted a small hotel with the flavor of old San Francisco, not a generic national chain hotel. I spotted the Orchard on the internet but was unable to book it my first week. I ended up at one of the many older, small hotels that populate the area and the very first night challenged my preconceptions. I got a dinky room that looked into a 6 foot wide alleyway separating my hotel from the next building; the restroom was so small, I had to go outside to turn around; my air conditioner was an open window. I had already booked the following week at the Orchard and decided to pay an inspection visit just in case I needed to revisit the chain hotel option. I was delighted by the large rooms, new furniture, huge bathrooms, and comfy pillow-top beds. Each room is equipped with a DVD system and the front desk maintains a DVD library. The hotel building is new with all the safety features and amenities that includes; the visual elevation, however, is designed to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood. I immediately booked several more weeks and now I\u2019m finishing up twenty weeks at the Orchard. The on-site restaurant, Daffodil, is first rate so on-site dining is rewarding if you\u2019re not in the mood to go out. The staff is great: friendly and knowledgeable about the area; attentive to my routine. I\u2019ve been pleased with my decision to stay at the Orchard from a comfort, safety, and cultural standpoint. The Orchard has just the flavor to complement that special San Francisco \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d without cramping my need for modern accommodations. Located on Bush Street, the Orchard is two blocks away from Union Square. It\u2019s located in a city residential area that has both fine and everyday restaurants, stores, salons, an art school, Cathedral, and the like. The Orchard is just steps away from the cable-car line on cross-street Powell. Union Square, just down Powell, is bustling with all the well known shopping, eateries, and hotels competing for your attention. Chinatown\u2019s Pine Street parallels Bush just one block further away from Union Square, while the main entrance on Grant Street is just two blocks down Bush. The location is \u201cIDEAL.\u201d Plenty of attractions and amenities are within an easy walk, but the noise and congestion of the commercial area isn\u2019t in your lap. Transportation to the wharf, Market Street, North Beach, and the rest that San Francisco offers is at your door. Put it this way, after twenty-one weeks, the Orchard remains my hotel-of-choice in San Francisco.

Taxi from airport was a little uncertain of the hotel's location which was surprising considering how central it is. Perhaps it does not have the same exposure as some of the bigger names in the area. Best thing about this hotel is location and bedrooms. First impressions of the hotel were a little unsure as the entrance and reception areas are simple. However, the bedrooms are very spacious and comfortable as are the bathrooms. Free wifi was also a pleasant surprise. Breakfast included in the rate is simple enough but adequate. Location is just off Union Square which is very central. Only problem is the steep hills around this area! Street cable car stops on the corner and a taxi trip to most of the city is about $10 per trip which is a bargain. Street cable car is expensive at $5 per journey per person if there are a few people so taxis are much better option. Would recommend this hotel for location and bedrooms but it does lack the public areas of some neighbouring hotels.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Reviewer030", "ReviewID": "UR14599310", "Content": "Lovely hotel and excellent location.

We had a 3rd Floor room on the corner of the building and experienced a small degree of noise from the traffic and early morning rubbish collectors but nothing that kept us awake.We had a room with 2 beds as requested and had a very spacious bathroom with a walk in shower but no bath. It was our impression that this could have been a room adapted for the disabled as there were several grab rails but these were not obtrusive. Breakfast was served in the restaurant off the small lobby and the buffet available was simple with a choice of some fruit, juice, bread, scones (delicious) cheese, ham and boiled eggs and croissants. Cooked meals were not available and this would have been a nice option but presumably, our tariff would have reflected this addition should it have been available.

We got the BART from the airport for $5 each, and decided to walk uphill up Powell Street (10 mins) which was fine until we reached the last block which was really steep pulling our bags! Extrememly welcoming at the Front desk and they also gave us a room on one of the top floors as we'd requested to have it quieter. We could still hear the morning noise from the street, but it is a city location! Fairly large room with large bathroom, not so soft toilet paper though. Shower over shallow bath was fine, always hot water. Very large comfortable bed. There's free internet on a laptop in the reception. Free USA Today newspaper in the morning outside your room. There are a couple of diners within one block. It was also only about 3 blocks from Avis car hire - we booked a car online from the UK for only \u00a336 (GBP) for 24 hours one way.

Some people have cited the room size as a concern; me and my wife differ. The room size was an average hotel room size; it was not noticeably small at all.

The only slight issue I'd knock is the breakfast. The Orchard offers what most other SF hotels offer -- a continental fare -- but perhaps I'm biased because I like to start my day with a big, protein-heavy breakfast.

On the whole, they are overpriced (tho often glamourous) and you always have to pay some exorbitant fee for parking when you arrive from out of town. The Orchard changes all my thinking. Just off Union Square, this boutique property has all of the amenities (and then some) of the larger properties just up the hill (i.e. Fairmont, Mark Hopkins) without the price tag and snooty staff. The lobby is tiny but nice and upon check-in, the staff was phenomenally kind. While the room was a tad small, it's not much smaller than a standard SF room elsewhere and as there were only 2 of us, it's not like we needed a suite! The bed and pillows were wonderful and the beds had DUVETS (which I'm an enormous fan of -- DOWN with those gross bacteria-filled coverlets!). There were spa robes in the closet for each of us (tho, one of them was starting to come apart a little at the belt loop) and the bathroom was extremely spacious and well-appointed with Aveda products and fluffy towels. The hotel provides DVDs for in-room use and has a pretty expansive library of new releases and classics. The staff is so helpful that when my boyfriend and I rolled in at around 1 a.m. in NEED of some late-night food, we were directed immediately to a diner up the street which satisfied our cravings. The location is fantastic and you can walk to everything (Chinatown, shopping, restaurants, bars). North Beach was a minimal $5 cab ride away. Despite having a view of another building (the standard view in a big city), the hotel was VERY VERY quiet. Our parking was taken care of by parking in the Sutter-Stockton garage merely 1 block away on Bush. The hotel only has valet and charges $34 overnite, but if you arrive on a Saturday after 6 and leave on Sunday any time after 7 a.m., the fee is only $15.

We had a beautiful suite on the tenth floor. It was a splurge, but it was great having two rooms. Huge bathroom. Walk in shower and also a bathtub. Free videos, with many choices. Local newspaper delivered to the room every weekday morning. We found that the staff was friendly and helpful- especially the doorman and the front desk.. The bed (even though people complained about them in previous reviews) was so much more than comfortable. The location was perfect. Within walking distance of Chinatown, North Beach and Union Square. Cable cars were a few feet away from the hotel\u2019s front door. They were crowded most of the time but they were worth it when we got on (other times we took cabs for about the same amount that it would cost to take the cable car to the Wharf). We met friendly and interesting locals and tourists on every cable car trip. The restaurant re-opened while we were there, but we never had the time to eat there. We did, however, enjoy the bar a couple of times. The only negative was that the wine prices were sporadic. One day a glass of wine was one price and the next day the same wine was $3 less than before. We never made it to breakfast at the hotel. We slept in most mornings because it was so quiet (we faced Bush). It was great to have coffee service in the room; but we were only given one caffeinated coffee packet. The other ones were one decaf and two teas. We never said anything about it because we were so happy with everything else. You must have breakfast and an Irish coffee at the Buena Vista at the end of the cable car line near Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Wonderful!!! Sears Restaurant, down Powell, near Walgreens, was a great breakfast place also. Even though Fisherman\u2019s Wharf is pretty commercial, we enjoyed Pier 39 (there were some nice restaurants there; try Pier Market), especially the sea lions. Alcatraz is a great half day trip. Sausalito was a great day trip by boat, too. When we left, the doorman recommended that we take the limo instead of a cab to the airport. It was only $12 more than a cab would have been and it was a perfect way to end our vacation. The next time we travel to San Francisco, we will definitely stay here again.

The car came in less than 10 minutes in most cases. they were very child friendly and got us a crib ($10) right away without even asking after they saw our 4 month old. we came in late after a very long day traveling with kids on a plane from LA and ordered room service. i could have eaten a shoe by that time, but it was EXCELLENT. my wife's spinach side was the best she ever had she said. the room is ample and not too frou frou but clean and good. not cool and sexy like a W like i like but that's so overplayed its nice to go the other direction. their hallways are small so you have nowhere to get lost. the elevator is quick. the visitors are mostly German for some reason. their bar later was great too. lots of small batch scotches and good stuff like that. the location cant be beat. you are literally 1.5 blocks from Macy's Union Square, Levi store, Cheesecake, Barney's and Neimans. Try the Neiman's bar - they rock too. Chinatown is just 2.5 blocks away and starbucks is right there at the entrance of Chinatown. what i dont like is their coffee setup in the room. too cumbersome and no way to not spill water on the counter. the shower has a plastic curtan too which is not great. it wasnt nasty, but they could do a nice tericloth and just wash it more and people would feel like its cleaner. also, it flooded our bath floor on both occasions. they have free dvd rental downstairs which is cool if you like that. all in all, another great find thanks to tripadvisor. btw, i am a big city guy doing reviews here. my buddy says all you tripadvisor reviewers are midwesterners -- not true. real travelers use this site exclusively and i am one of them. my only tip is to book at the HOTEL'S website only. You wont pre-pay and you get better terms and usually better pricing. i'd rather pay $10 or $25 more to get a free cancel opp the day before.

The Orchard staff promised that one of their finance members will call me within 48 hours. Surprise, surprise, the hotel did not call me back.

Not only did the hotel not return my call, but they did not refund the overcharge. I contacted the hotel for the third time, and the lady told me that she could NOT help me because she was NOT the people that I spoke to earlier. I informed her that I had spoken to two different people and that both gave me the same spiel about 'how they will take care of it' but neither followed through. I told her that ''Why in the world would I want to talk to those individuals again when they couldn't follow through their promises to their customers? Hence, the reason that I want to talk to someone else.' She then told me that she 'will take care of it'. I informed her that I will keep calling the hotel until I get this resolved. Within an hour, the hotel called me back and told me the refund has been processed. Honestly, the Orchard hotel should not have taken nearly four weeks to process my refund. Furthermore, why did the hotel immediately processed my refund ONLY after I stated that I will keep calling the hotel until this situation gets resolved?

The hotel is quiet, very convenient to the cable car lines (Powell, California and F Line), and the hotel staff from the desk, concierge and continental dining staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The rooms are very comfortable and I thought the rates very, very good. I did not mind that the hotel did not have a full dining room as there are excellent restaurants nearby. In fact, I found the Roxanne, right next door, to be perfect for breakfast when I got tired of the continental fare, but the continental breakfast (free) at the hotel was really pretty nice. We are not frequent travelers, so we did not fully understand the hotel's refusal to allow us to take the continental back to the room, but it was not a big deal. If you have not been to SF before and you are going to be there for anything near three days, get the city pass that allows you to travel on the muni systems including the cable cars. The stop for the Powell lines is all of 50 paces from the hotel door and is a must for sane travel around SF. The Powell line can take you down to Market where you can get the F Line from Market and Stockton to do all of the Fisherman Wharf stops. From Fishermans Wharf you can get either the Powell Hyde or the Powell Mason cable car back to the intersection of Bush and Powell and see most of what you want to see in downtown SF by riding them that way.

We paid less than $200 a night. This is a small, clean, comfortable, and most importantly, a quiet hotel. It is very clean, and they also offer free WiFi, which some others in the city charge for. There is also a laptop in the lobby you can use for checking email, flight status, etc. The bathroom was great - larger than average with an elegant appearance. The room was probably larger than most hotel rooms in San Francisco, but not large by any definition. But it was comfortable. Our room had a lousy view of an alley, but then again, we didn't choose this place for its view. Our room location may have been a factor in the quietness. Also, the hotel is just steps from a Hyde St cable car stop, so you can get quickly to and from Fisherman's Wharf. Chinatown is 2 blocks down Bush St, Union Square is 2 blocks down Powell.

This is a good place to be, in my opinion; not as costly as the name places on the top of Nob Hill, and not as noisy as those hotels right on Union Square. Front desk service was friendly and capable, though when we arrived around 7 p.m. on a weeknight, there was only one person behind the front desk, and no bellman apparent. But the reception was still courteous and quick, since things were not very busy. The room itself was a nice size, clean, and well furnished with one major exception: the bed was very hard, and not what one would expect in a superior hotel (no box spring: just a mattress on a the wooden bed base). This may sound like a small point, but after four nights, we were very ready to not sleep here any longer. It just was not a good bed. The hotel offered a turn-down service, but we found the knock on our door at 6:30 p.m. to make the offer too early, and intrusive (as we were getting ready to go out for the evening). Can't this thing just happen while one is out to dinner, as it does in so many other hotels? All in all, this is a fine hotel, and for the price, a good deal for the area it is in. It is not, though, a 4 star experience, and for those spending more than a night, I would probably recommend spending a bit more, and staying on Nob Hill, or at one of the better Starwood properties in town instead.

We had one regular room with a kind bed, and a suite which had a king bed in the bedroom and a queen sofa bed in the living room for our children. The location is excellent for tourists in San Francisco. We went to see Golden Gate Bridge and Muir Woods before checking into the hotel so we could drive there.

After leaving the car with the valet, we did the rest of the sites by walking or taking the cable cars. This hotel is located very close to Union Square (lots of shopping and restaurants), Westfield Centre (very large high end mall), and China town. These were easy to walk to. There are some hills, but that is part of what you expect to see in San Francisco as a tourist. The cable car stop is at the intersection of Bush and Powell, within a few yards of the hotel, where 2 cable car lines stop. You can get an all day pass for the cable cars (and buses) for $11 per day at Walgreens (located one block from hotel). I recommend this option because otherwise it is $5 per ride. You can take the Mason-Powell cable car north to the end of the line, and then walk a few blocks to pier 33 for Alcatraz tours. You can take the Hyde-Powell cable car north to see the crooked part of Lombard St. It is a lot more fun to take cable cars rather than cabs. We like the Union Square area much better for our hotel instead of Fisherman's wharf area (were we stayed in the past).

The best thing about The Orchard is it's location. It basically sits in the Nob Hill/Union Square area on the corner of Powell and Bush Streets which is 3-4 blocks from Union Square and 2-3 blocks from the main gate to China Town. The Powell-Mason and Powell-Hyde cable cars lines are literally 20 steps from the hotel front door. Both will take you to Union Square and the Powell Street BART station and either to Fishermans Wharf or North Beach depending on which cable car you hop on. But if you aren't into the cable cars or feel like getting some exercise then Union Square is a quick 5 minute walk straight down Powell Street and China Town is also a 5 minute walk straight down Bush Street. If you are renting a car the closest and best place is on O'Farrell Street in the heart of Union Square about 4 blocks from the hotel. There are 4-5 major rental car companies and the mid week rates are relatively cheap. We rented a four door Economy for $28 per day. And here's a little secret........if you have to keep your car overnight but don't want to pay the $30+ for overnight parking at the hotel then you can park for $15 (late night special) in the same garage as where you first picked it up for as long as you arrive after 7pm and leave the garage before 9am. The Orchard is a great value because your room rate includes free continental breakfast every morning, free internet and a free shuttle to the financial district. We stayed there a few weeks ago and averaged approximately $175 per night. Other larger chain hotels in the immediate area were $250+ per night and didn't include breakfast or internet access. The rooms are very nice and in great condition with updated features including comfortable beds, nice furniture and a stocked \"honor\" bar including cold drinks, snacks etc. Our bathroom was larger than average and very nice with a marble floor, high quality toiletries and a very nice sink / vanity.

She had never been to SF and I was returning after 20 years. The location is absolutely the best and must be figured in with every other deciding factor. We had a wonderful time, easily walking from the hotel through Chinatown, North End (Italian) and then finishing up at and immediately turning back from the touristy Wharf. It was interesting, almost disheartening, for her to see that there are \"repeat performances\" at all tourists areas throughout the world (d.j.s, fast painting, same restauraunt chains, same hustle) and that it is important to find the unique aspects (sourdough bread) in each city. SO, back to the hotel. We arrived with a rental car which we eventually returned early . Parking was a total drag. The hotel admonished us to watch out for towing, asking us to remember to fill the meters up until after ticket time, etc. and always segued by encouraging us to use their extremeley expensive valet service. Well, this can be taken both ways I expect and they were just trying to (in my most optimistic mood) keep us from getting towed, but I do live in a major city, know how to read meters and so on. Bottom line is a happy one: you don't really need a car if you are staying in SF! We actually drove to and from Santa Clara, returned the car to the airport, took the BART train back in to town and used BART again to get back to the airport. Further to the hotel, as promised..The bed was remarkably comfortable. We had no view but it did not matter. Daughter liked the Aveda products. Our tub did not drain well (7th floor) and water was nigh calf high after the two of us took back to back and not excessively long showers. Admittedly, I neglected to mention this until our last day, however this issue is rarely encountered at even the most budget oriented hotels. I was not able get online (directed to an 800 number for which I had not the energy to deal) so instead used the very accessibly computer right at the reception desk. Was able to print out boarding passes, quickly check email, etc. We were too tired to use the movies, but it was a nice idea. As to breakfast, and having read the earlier reviews, I really cannot imagine what else on earth one could want unless it is total table service with warm food being served by request. No, there is no Devonshire cream, made to order pancakes, soft boiled eggs on toast crusts. Isn't that the \"not included\" breakfast concept where we get to order a specific breakfast? We were thrilled with the choices: fresh (not sugared!) yogurt, fresh fruit (lots of it ) toast, and so on. There were numerous choices, in our opinion. We even took some bananas and apples for the road when on our way back. I am not a business traveller for this review, however, if the getting online in room problem could be fixed, I would highly recommend this hotel for that purpose.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, Penna", "Title": "\u201cexcellent\u201d", "Author": "Occasionaltraveler4", "ReviewID": "UR7975859", "Content": "spent 7 nights with 2 rooms for our family of 4 including a 16 and 19 year old.

The experience from start to finish was excellent. While being priced similarly to other boutique hotels, the Orchard featured so many little touches that just made your stay so much more pleasant. For example: - Large room, with king-size bed, and more pillows than anyone could ever use - Free (wired) internet access (wireless only on first 2 floors, due to range of the signal) - Large TV, with combined DVD/CD/Surround-sound system - with even (surprisingly) a bass speaker, that made watching any of the extensive range of complementary, up-to-date DVDs from the hotel reception a real cinematic experience - A 'calm' book and music CD on the table for those who have trouble sleeping - Amazing 'natural flow' taps in the bathroom, that, cheesy as it may sound, reminded me of a mountain stream! - Walk-in shower - A (quite stylish) laptop for guest use just by reception, with printer, on which I printed my Alcatraz tour tickets, and boarding passes for my onward flight The staff were also very well turned out, professional, and always friendly. The overall experience was such as to make it impossible to leave the hotel feeling anything but positive. The location is also great - two blocks uphill from Union Square, and 20 paces from a Cable Car stop, which goes to Market Street in one direction (major 'real' shopping street / thoroughfare), and Fisherman's Wharf in the other (extremely touristy area). The only two hiccups: the breakfast in the downstairs restaurant, while complementary, is pretty limited in size, range and quality; I'd simply ignore it unless you really don't want to go out. The other was the Valet parking charges; the rate was advertised at $34 per 24hrs, which seemed just about reasonable - however, the valet's services are added on-top, as is tax - leading to just under $100 for two nights' parking, and taking the car out once in-between! This was as much as a week's car rental - and there is no other option. Parking in SF *is* expensive, but the price is $10 higher than at the local car parks, so the additional valet charges (I tipped as well) were unexpected. Overall, however, it's a wonderful hotel.

King bed and ,surprisingly, pull-out queen sleeper were comfortable. Room was clean and modern. (I like new and big vs. old and small). Front staff couldn't have been better. Shout out to Brent-doorman (saved me a parking ticket), Art- doormen (knowledgable), Beth and the birthday girl (front staff) and the rest of the staff. Check in and check out were uneventful which is good.

Arrived Sat., found a parking place on the street and found the meter is 25 cents for 5 minutes of parking. But after 6 pm, is free until Mon. am. Monday we parked a couple of blocks down Bush at the Sutter/Stockton garage. All in all, an excellent stay except for a minor hassle. Sun. a.m. went to the front desk for additional coffee packets for in room coffee maker and the person at front desk indicated ther was also coffe in the restaurant (run by another entity and not by the hotel). Went in, got two small cups to go, no charge (or I could pay $1.00 each for a large cup). Came back down and had continental breakfast. Mon. again went to the restaurant for coffee (half asleep) and was told by Jose that if I take coffee to go, this will be considered my continental breakfast or I can pay $1.50 per cup if I wanted coffee to go. Explained to him about Sun. He would not budge. Talked to Beth at front desk about this. We went back to talk to Jose and I could see Beth was surprised at his response and she asked when this change took place. He gave some lame excuse and refused her plea .

Check-in at the marble-tiled lobby was smooth and quick. The rooms are clean, bright, and fresh. The beds are very big and comfortable, with soft white sheets and fluffy comforters. The bathroom in our room was bright with clean, white tiles, and lots of Aveda bath products. High speed Internet is included, but unfortunately our room (on the 7th floor) did not have wireless. The complimentary breakfast buffet was a fantastic way to start the day. We took the newspaper that was delivered to our door down to the restaurant and enjoyed their freshly brewed coffee, toast, jams, cereal, fresh fruit, bagels, and juices every morning. The Orchard caters to a range of different groups of people. It is a great option for couples looking for a romantic weekend, business people wanting close access to downtown, and families with older children wanting a nice place to stay on vacation. We will definitely stay at The Orchard again next time we are in San Francisco!", "Date": "March 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfort, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOrchard is Fantastic\u201d", "Author": "bwm57", "ReviewID": "UR7196188", "Content": "My wife and I heard about the hotel from friends and booked our stay with our two children.

The staff were out-of-the-way helpful, whether offering advice on getting around the city, restaurants or a town car to the aiport. The small lobby is attractively finished, but there is no room to hang out and people watch. The hotel is located on the southslope of Nob Hill, 2 blocks from Union Square. Easy walking to many restaurants and dozens of shops, and if you don't mind a steep or longer (15 minute walk), in range of Nob Hill, Japantown, SOMA, the Ferry Building and even North Beach. Mass transit is easy: a north-south (Powell-Hyde) and an east-west (California St.) streetcar line are within 2 blocks, as is a bus route. Taxis are hailable within minutes in this part of the city. My wife and I walked or used mass transit most of the time, including after midnight and never felt unsafe, although the Union Square area is thick with pandhandlers, especially during the day. (On nice weekend days, the streetcars can be insanely crowded with tourists and may necessitate finding other transportation.) Our room was on the 8th floor with a view of a couple of blocks of the city. The room was medium-size, which for San Francisco is supposedly larger-than-average. While there were a couple of small stains on the carpet, in general the room was in good condition and decorated better than a Holiday Inn but not as nice as a Hilton perhaps. We had a reading chair in one corner and a desk in another, with complimentary ethernet broadband which was fairly fast. (There is wifi in the hotel, but it only works on the 2nd floor.) An armoire held a 27\" TV with DVD and CD player. The hotel has a large DVD library that you can use for free. The bed was a king, which seemed to be like a futon on top of a platform. It was overly firm: my wife didn't mind it as much as I did, but both of us slept well anyway. The minibar fridge had room to put a few of our own perishables in it, and the closet was stocked with robes, slippers and a safe. Fairly large bathroom nicely finished in polished tile with fantastic water pressure. Housecleaning was thorough and prompt everyday. The hotel works with a babysitting company (licensed and bonded) if you need to escape for an evening while they watch the kids in the room. Expensive-but-standard rate around town for hotel sitters: $100 for 4-hour minimum. Complimentary \"European\" breakfast consisted of a light continental breakfast with slices of ham and swiss as well. Barely sustainable for us and very average quality. They seemed to be temporarily out of 1-2 items almost at all times, although it was eventually restocked. By the way, the hotel may have used to do a little happy hour with free wine like many boutiques in the area, but they don't anymore. There is a laptop at the front desk with broadband internet access for guest use - a nice feature when you want to quickly check the weather or directions to a meeting at the last minute. Overall, we had a very nice stay and I would recommend it to friends if you don't need a grand lobby typical of the chain hotels.

Our greeting by the front desk staff was terffic. They did not have a room ready yet (we arrived at 10:30AM) but took our bags, made some suggestions for Dim Sum lunch, and did a good job orienting us. Upon our return, our room was ready and the staff quickly brought our bags up. The rooms are very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The linens are great and the bathroom was huge. Great comfy robes with linings and slippers were very much appreciated. It was also well lit, which is a complaint of mine. More and more hotels seem to leave you in the dark with 25 watt bulbs. Breakfast was a very nice continental buffet with fresh fruit, baked breads, hard boiled eggs, sliced meats and cheeses, juices and great coffee. It was at our first breakfast that we had the honor to meet the owner Mrs. S.C. Huang. She is extremely unassuming, warm, brilliant person who is often in the dining room having breakfast with the guests. She shared many stories about the hotel and it's sister hotel, The Orchard Garden. The hotels are built in the loving memory of her husband and her daughter, both of whom she recently lost to cancer. The staff is extremely helpful with ideas for dinner spots, things to see, directions, and can arrange car services, taxis, and other transportation for you.

Better to explore San Francisco. As soon as you step out of the hotel you're on a cable car line. Turn left and you're on another cable car line. Walk 2-3 blocks downhill and you reach yet another cable car line, the main drag for several bus routes, and the underground train. The Orchard offers a breakfast buffet that you must pay for.

The room was exceptionally quiet, with no adjacent room sounds and very little street noise. Each morning a buffet continental breakfast was provided with several choices of ham, cheese, hard boiled eggs, toast, jam/jellies, spice cake, cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, juices, etc. The rooms also include DVD players and the front desk has a variety of DVD movies to choose from at no cost. We ate at several places during our stay, but absolutely loved Harris Steak House for the best filet I ever tasted, also ate at Tadisch Grill, the seafood was excellent, and for a quick inexpensive great Chinese lunch, try the House of Nanking.

They are professionals at taking care of the details. A great treat was meeting the hotel owner Mrs. Huang. She told me \"I tell my staff that I only have the money our guests spend here to pay you. So, treat them with respect and treat them well so they'll come back and so they'll refer their friends to us. Otherwise, we won't be able to stay in business\".

We were visiting with our two children aged 7 and 14 and we had spent a day doing a lot of walking, in the evening they were very tired and we allowed them to stay upstairs watching TV whilst we decided to go down and eat in the restaurant. We asked the barmen if we could have two cheese sandwiches sent to the room for the boys. They said this could not be done as it wasn't on the menu, we persuaded them to go and ask the chef but apparently the chef said that although he had both cheese and bread there was no way he was going to do this. When we explained that the boys were upstairs watching TV after a long day and just wanted something quick and easy one of the two barmen commented that perhaps the solution would be to turn off the TV! In fact both of these barmen had a friend at the bar and were more interested in discussing \"adult\" web sites with each other thank attending to their guests. Yes it was a quiet night and the restaurant was empty and we were the only two at the bar, however this is no excuse. Needless to say we declined to eat at the restaurant and went down to Subway to get a sandwich for us all. We really feel this let them down a lot and was not the sort of service that appears to get them such a good rating on trip advisors web site and so accounts for them not getting 5 stars from us. We would like to say that the young girl who works the restaurant floor and the lady who works on the bar were very nice, chatty and helpful and perhaps the two gentlemen might take a lesson in good manners and a helpful attitude from them.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5351924", "Content": "We stayed at the Orchard hotel for two nights (June 5th to 7th).

The Orchard proved me wrong and I say with a smile, I am glad I found a perfect place that fits all my needs when in SF on business trips (which is several times a year). When booking, I requested a high floor room and stated I would have a late check in (did not arrive until 11pm). I was so happy that I got on the top floor as typically such a request is a shot in the dark when you have a late check in a full hotel. The staff was very friendly. Everyone was smiling and very communicative about the services offered by the hotel. I was even more happy when I opened my door and entered my room. For ONCE, I was in a very clean room. No stains! I knew the hotel offered a DVD player as well as a DSL connection but, as typical in other hotels I stay in, I did not expect much when turning on the TV. I turn on the TV and guess what .... The Orchard offers free standard cable and HBO; not your typical 10 or so channels. Also, the TV is a normal TV not tied to some hotel menu driven system in which you have to pay for movies or pass a menu screen first. So in this respect, you have a feeling of being at home. They offer a wide variety of movies for free use at the counter. But, knowing they have a DVD player, you can always bring your own too. Since I was there on business, I bring a laptop. The DSL connection service is great. Simple to set up, logon, and use - they even provide cables if you forget yours. Unlike tourist (I used to live in SF so know the City), when in SF, after a long workday I typically just get take out after work and head to my hotel and relax. So, these simple accomadations are very important and made my stay very comfortable since I spend considerable time in the room. The hotel itself is very clean and nice. You won't get fancy high-end furnishings (REMEMBER this is under $200/night) but, you will get nice up-to-date simple, clean and modern furnishings. Very clean bedding with very soft pillows. The bathroom is nice with Avena products. My room also had a bar area with a fridge and coffee maker. The included breakfast is basically coffee, juice, a few cereal options, a wide variety of bread choices, fruit, jelly, cheese, hard boiled eggs, and lunch style meat. Nothing fancy, nothing made to order but, very decent and FREE. You do have options for parking. There are several garages around the hotel but, I chose to valet park at approx $39/night. Bascially, the garage up the street parks your car for you. You can park in the same garage directly yourself for a few dollars cheaper if you wish but, if you are going in/out USE the hotel valet service since if you park yourself, you cannot go in/out and have to pay each time you exit. There is also another garage down the street from the hotel that can be even cheaper but, I beleive you have to park after 5pm and leave by 7am the next othewise, the standard downtown rate of approx. $35-40 applies. If you book on the Orchard website, they do have a \"Park and Shop\" special which includes parking but, it was not available when I booked this stay. Luckily, I return next month and that package was available. If available, nothing beats that package and the daily rate is still well under $200. Expect to pay around $230/night if paying for parking separately (still an excellent value for what you get in this hotel). Can't say enough about the staff and customer service. You'll get a reminder email about the hotel a few days before your reservation date too. Also, when I checked in, the front desk was very speedy ... I did not see the same person until I checked out 4 days later and as I walked out of the elevator she addressed me by name which I found impressive. The bell hops, parking attendants, and maids were all very friendly too. Now is this hotel without any issue? Ok, in all honesty (with all my reviews) there was only ONE thing. My room had a door that connected to another room. That door is not a good sound barrier. One morning, I did hear a conversation in the room next to me but, in fairness I know the person was on a cell phone since she was talking business and talking very loud and standing right next to that door. The rooms have a surround sound system too. I can see a possible issue if someone next to you is not \"polite\" at night and decides to blast that system watching a DVD. But, for my stay that was not an issue. So to sum this up ... a SF hotel for under $200/night that provides a clean room, a free DSL connection, a good variety of TV choices, a DVD unit which you can bring your own or borrow from a wide selection, up to date simple furnishings, a good parking package for the area (if available), free breakfast, and a very friendly staff .... I know it sounds too good to be true but, IT IS! The Orchard can't be beat for the price in a great downtown location. It's just a few blocks from Union Square. For being in downtown, the location is actually quiet. I did not see any of the negativities normally seen in SF around this hotel (such as the homeless). Needless to say, I was impressed. The front desk also mentioned they are in the process of building a second hotel nearby this one. I've posted a few reviews on SF hotels here and honestly, this is the first positive review of mine for SF hotels priced under $200/night.

Oh by the way, the Bart Station is five blocks walk from the hotel and if you are not used to walking, it could be a strenous exercise so better bring comfortable shoes and lugggage with wheels.

Check-in was fast and easy and the doorman was really friendly and helpful. Our room was nice looking. Since the hotel is only a couple of years old, its fresh and clean. The room did not have a microwave, but it did have a mini refrigerator. The refrigerator was part of the mini bar, so you had to get a key from the front desk to use it. That was a pain. The room had a nice large TV with a DVD player. The sound system was decent. There was a speaker built into the ceiling right above the bed, and there was also a subwoofer. I thought that was a nice touch, even though we didn't watch much TV. The bathroom was OK. There was no tub, just a huge shower stall. I didn't like the shower stall that much because it didn't have a shelf to put my shampoo and soap on. The Aveda cosmetics didn't really excite me at all. I don't understand why other reviewers are going nuts over these average (at best) cosmetics. There was nothing wrong with them, but I just don't understand what all the hoopla is about. The breakfast sucked. Why did the breakfast suck? Let me count the ways. Primarily, lack of selection. They had some fruit and a few pieces of bread, and boiled eggs. They had two very plain and boring cereals. They made a big to-do over it, and tried to act all stuffy over it. Instead of just letting people come in and sit down, they had one of those \u201cPlease Wait to be Seated\u201d signs. The worst part is that there was no one there to seat anyone! We wound up just walking in and sitting down after a nice customer told us we should. For some reason, they were using white linen tablecloths. There were no disposable cups or plates, which meant we could not take food to our room, or take a cup of coffee to go on the way out in the morning. Of course none of that mattered since there was nothing worth taking. The breakfast scared us away from ever ordering anything from room service. I know hotel continental breakfasts are just supposed to be a light meal to get your day started, but I also know that the breakfasts I have had at chains like Hampton Inn were a thousand times better than this garbage. All in all, I would say The Orchard Hotel is really overrated on TripAdvisor. I don\u2019t really agree with the reviews. I don\u2019t think the people who wrote them get out too often. The place was perfectly acceptable, but not amazing by any stretch of the imagination. Also, I agree with the last reviewer who mentioned that the location is not that great.

There was deli ham and cheese, however nothing to put it on except for the white bread.

Juan unloaded our bags and and waited for us to check-in and then proceeded to help us to our room. The room was gorgeous! About the bed: My husband commented that the bed in our room was almost more comfortable than the one at home!! We got a king-size bed in our room, and the linens were REALLY nice (not sure what the thread count was, but it was pristine). We each had two full-sized goosedown feather pillows to ourselves, which was a treat considering we usually get three at a hotel where we reserve a king-size bed and have to call down to ask for another. Instead of the usual bedspread (which, frankly, give me the creeps in hotel rooms and is the first thing to go on the floor), ours had an impeccably plush (and clean) down comforter. The bathroom was large, with a stand-up shower and the best part...Aveda products! Aveda soap, moisturizing lotion, shampoo and conditioner...this is good stuff! The Orchard offers valet parking for $34 a day with in-and-out privileges; it proved to be worthwhile. Parking in SF is a pain in the behind, and it was handy to be able to call down to the front desk and have your car waiting for you in 15-20 minutes. A complimentary European continental breakfast was included with our stay. The items included delicious pumpkin and other sweet tasting breads, yummy croissants, fruits, juices, teas and coffee. During our first morning there, we had the great pleasure of meeting the owner of the hotel, Mrs. Huong. She was really sweet, and you could tell she takes great pride in how her hotel is run and, more importantly, how her guests are treated. This type of customer service is a rarity these days.

This was my first trip to SF, but with any luck, it won't be my last! What a wonderful town!

Temperatures ranged from 68-72 during the day, and once the AM fog was gone, the sun shone brightly all week. Evenings were cooler, I think it may have dipped to the upper 50's one night. Several establishments chose to forego the air conditioning in favor of open windows to take advantage of the breezes. The Orchard is well situated between Union Square, Chinatown, and Nob Hill. The staff couldn't be more helpful. The room was spacious and clean. Following the advice of previous posts, we requested a room in the front, to avoid the alley and trash pickup. Some people had said that, being in the front, they were bothered by the cable cars--they stop about a half block away, we hardly heard them at all.

We booked our Alcatraz tour in advance, again following the posting advice that trips sell out, which, in fact, was good advice, as they had. Took a tour of Muir Woods and Sausilito--loved the woods, didn't get much time in Sauilito, so we took the ferry over again later in the week. Also took a tour with SF Tours of the wine country--a combination of Napa and Sonoma wineries. Next time, I would rent a car and spend a couple of days--it was a nice introduction, but I definately would have liked to do some more exploring. For a fun evening, don't miss \"Beach Blanket Babylon\". Have dinner before hand at Trattoria Cantadina, just a block away. We also had a great dinner at Julius' Castle--the food and the views were both top notch. Plan to be there for sunset. We also took a dinner cruise on the Hornblower--pricey, but good food, spectacular views, and live music. An aside about the cable cars---don't look to them as a reliable means of transporation--take them instead for the novelty of it, when you aren't in a hurry to get to where you are going. Unless you wait in line at either end point of the route (which can be up to an hour wait) your chances of getting on along the way are slim to none, as the crowded cars will not stop to pick up more passengers, and routinely pass by the stops with would-be passengers. Buses run frequently and are easy to navigate. As an \"easterner\" I found San Francisco to be a city of friendly, happy people. No trace of the harried, hurried pace found across the country. And---what a concept---cars actually stop for pedestrians!", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cDeserves the great reviews\u201d", "Author": "WestCanTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3728725", "Content": "I've stayed in many SF hotels, but decided to try the Orchard after reading TripAdvisor reviews ... and I could not agree more with all the good press the hotel gets.

I was so excited to try the Orchard after reading all these great comments. My wife and I are frequent visitors to S.F. so I have stayed in quite a few hotels in the city. The Orchard was a dissapointment, plain and simple. Its not that anything was really all that wrong with the place, it just was not anything great. We paid close to $185.00 per night for a mid-week, three night stay. King bed, top floor. The hotel raves about the complimentary breakfast, we thought it was gross. The coffee was not very good, the selection was really weak, and what they had tasted bad. They had an assortment of fruit, an OK coffee cake, juice, coffee and thats about it. There is no real lobby, you walk in and there is the door to the resterant, the front desk, and the elevator to the rooms. Thats it. The location is not good. It is a real hike to get from Union Sqaure to the Orchard by foot, because on either side of the hotel are very, very steep hills. (Even by SF standards) Children or older folks would not be able to do it, espescially after walking half the day around the city. The resteraunt is very nice, but very pricey. The room was quiet and clean, the bed was comfy. If anything, this hotel is standard. If the prices came down, it might be really good. BUT, it will never be great. Oh, and the staff at the front desk were not friendly either, in fact upon check-out I gave the young lady the wrong room number and she rolled her eyes at me, then looked at her fellow employee like \"Can you believe this?\".

Chinatown takes less that 10 minutes to walk to and the trolley runs down the street just outside the hotel, but good luck getting a spot on the trolley because it's so packed by the time it gets up here that people are literally hanging off the sides of the thing. The staff has been very nice, we were greeted by a kind doorman named James who told us to not worry about our bags and he then brought them up to us within 5 minutes. The staff was always willing to answer any questions or refer us to someone else who could. HOWEVER - we had problems with our tv and we called down to let them know. I was told I would get a call back in a few minutes and I never heard back from anyone. I had to call them again. In another situation, we called down to ask about making reservations for a restaurant, the concierge told us he would call us right back with information and he even offered to make a reservation for us but he never even got back to us so I made a reservation myself (which I would have done 30 minutes before if he didn't tell me he would take care of it!). When we left to go out to eat, he was standing around outside doing nothing. The breakfast is decent, good enough to kill the hunger pains and it's f-r-double e. Room service menu is the worst I personally have ever seen. One last thing I will mention is that they claim to have a workout facility but don't go there expecting much. It's 2 stationary bikes and 1 eliptical and thats it...not 1 pound of weights.

The doorman (who, by the way, never once opened the door for us) seemed indifferent most of the time. Upon our arrival, someone was parked in the unloading zone, so my boyfriend parked a few spaces ahead, whereby the doorman advised us that it was a truck loading zone. When we proceeded to unload our bags and bring them to the room, he then called towing and notified them that our car was parked there! Aside from the amenities listed above, the high points of this place are the location (a mere two blocks from Union Square and a brief journey to Lombard St if you\u2019re brave) and the hotel restaurant/bar the Vignette was quite good and the staff was wonderful.

In contrast, another raved-about place on tripadvisor has increased prices by only 20%. (These two places had been about the same price in early 2004.) Maybe Orchard realized they were worth more. Maybe most hotel rates in the city have spiked. Whatever the reason, their price increase bites, because I have a feeling that Orchard's fabulous prices were a big reason behind all the gushing. So I hope the rates stay reasonable. That's what made The Orchard special. (Just a year ago it was $105 for a Sunday night stay. A weeknight stay is now about $180). Having said all that, Orchard is still a good deal at today's prices -- compared to what you'd have to pay at the big names -- because the Orchard's accomodations are just as good.

We arrived at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday afternoon and expected only to park our car and return later to check-in. We were greeted warmly by the doorman (and somewhat of a legend) James the second we pulled up to the curb. Imagine our surprise when we walked into the lobby and were told a room was not only ready for us - that we were being upgraded at no charge to a King Suite!!! Considering the already-great AAA rate of $144 a night we received, this was a wonderful surprise. Check-in took about three minutes total and we excitedly headed upstairs. We were put in Room #601, a lovely suite with great bay window views of Bush & Powell Streets and all the way down to Kearny Street. You could even see the Grant Street gate leading into Chinatown. It was on the sixth floor right next to the elevator. We were concerned by this for all of about one minute, as we discovered immediately that you couldn't hear a THING outside the room once the door was closed - not even the icemaker next door! Street noise was barely audible as well. If the wonderful sound of clanging bells of cable cars aggravates you, I don't suggest staying elsewhere - I suggest not staying in San Francisco at all! It's an endearing feature of this great city! The room was absolutely spotless. Floors, carpeting, furniture and walls were all spic and span. The bathroom was scrubbed clean and everything smelled very fresh. It had both a tub and a large shower and was well-stocked with big fluffy towels and Aveda bath products, which I really enjoyed using up. The furniture was all lovely and in great shape and the bed super comfortable. I do recommend watching your shins on the corners of the bed, as has been noted here before - since the beds are on a platform there are sharp corners at shin-height just waiting to make contact with your legs if you aren't careful. The duvet was soooo thick and comfortable, and there were extra pillows in the closet along with two great big cozy robes. The minibar and snack drawer were packed with a great assortment of drinks and snacks. The televisions in both rooms were large Sonys with great sound. We honestly could not find ONE thing to speak critically of, and as often as we travel we usually do find something not to our liking wherever we go - but The Orchard successfully stumped us and left us both feeling very pampered and happy during our far-too-short stay. The entire staff was polite and friendly and James had great recommendations for places to dine out. Cornell brought our car around within a few minutes upon check-out on Sunday afternoon and even offered to pack the trunk for us. My one regret is not remembering the name of the front desk clerk who checked us in on Saturday - she was polite and efficient all at once and I feel bad I cannot name her by name here. We both enjoyed The Orchard Hotel so much that we are already looking for excuses to stay over in early March when friends from London come to visit. They had a reservation at another Union Square hotel but will be canceling it in favor of staying at the Orchard now, thanks to the wonderful service we received from this first-class establishment. The Orchard Hotel is a world-class hotel disguised as a smaller boutique property. Take my word as well as the hundreds of other satisfied guests here. Book your stay here and you won't regret it.

His organization books numerous guests there annually. So I booked a two-night stay in December 2004 with great anticipation. When I went to check in, at 11 p.m., the woman at the front desk asked for my driver's license. It was then that I learned that I'd left it in my rental car, which I'd already returned to the Oakland airport. I asked if I could show alternate ID and/or pay cash for the room that I had reserved. She hemmed and hawed and looked uncomfortable. Then she asked the night manager. He said that they required an ID. He said that they would call the hotel manager at home but that generally they would not allow someone to check in without a photo ID. I asked him if he intended to put me, a single woman, out on the street at 11 p.m., to which he looked at me and just repeated that it was their policy. I said that surely they have had this situation come up before and had some way to deal with this, but he repeated that it was their policy. At that point, he turned away, so I was left to go outside, by myself, with my luggage, and hope to find a hotel that would take me. I am very sorry that I had this experience because people speak so glowingly of the Orchard, but I cannot in any way recommend the Orchard. That type of rigidity and failure to go the extra step to find a resolution is not the mark of good guest service or good management. In contrast, I went around the corner to the St. Francis, where a very nice night clerk waived their requirement for a photo ID, saying that I looked acceptable and not a security threat, and gave me a very nice room.

This wasn't a problem, however, and we didn't hear any noise from it at all. The bathroom was huge and was stocked with Aveda products. The shower was separate from the bathtub and was very spacious. The room was nicely decorated and the king size bed was extremely comfortable. One quibble about hotels in general --- use fitted sheets! I HATE it when the bottom sheets slips off, exposing you to the bare mattress. Ugh. This happens at the Westin too. Internet connectivity/DSL was free. The hotel also had complimentary DVDs -- from suspense to comedy, kids' fare to drama -- and very current titles. The suite also came with a CD player -- you have to bring your own music -- and two TVs. The mini bar was amply stocked as was a drawer filled with necessities you could buy. We paid $259 USD for the suite and it's well worth every penny when you're travelling with a child. The average room cost, I believe, is about $159 USD. In terms of location, it was perfect. The hotel was on the corner of Bush and Powell, minutes from Union Square, Chinatown and right on the cable car line. Breakfast was included -- European style. The concierges and the front desk staff were wonderful and went out of their way to help us out. This is definitely our home away from home in San Francisco. We loved it! One last thing -- we found a great little Italian restaurant on lower Columbus Avenue (15 Columbus) called La Gondola. The phone number is ---------. The food was delicious. Also, if you're in the mood for some quick Mexican, there's a little hole in the wall restaurant -- only four tables -- just up the street from the Orchard on the same side of Bush. The food was fab.

The bad news is that the Orchard is not a Hyatt. Let me point out that I enjoyed my stay at the Orchard (12/4/04-12/6/04) and plan to stay there again. But I will do so fully aware of the hotel's quirks. The hotel has the intimate feel of a boutique hotel without the tiny claustrophobic European-style rooms so commonly found in such hotels. And I enjoyed the many features one would not likely find at a deluxe chain such as a Hyatt or an Intercontinental. For example, the staff was exceptionally friendly (though not particularly professional, see below), and the continental breakfast was a bonus (with one caveat). I also enjoyed the large TV, full array of cable channels, and full in-room stereo (including subwoofer) that one would not likely find at a large chain. But we also had a few minor negative experiences that I would not expect at a deluxe chain. On checking in my wife and I were given a room with two small full sized beds instead of the king bed I reserved and paid for last August. The first desk clerk indicated that it was all she had even though the hotel was not full. Only upon moving up the food chain and discussing the situation with a more senior clerk/manager was an appropriate room found, albeit one next to the elevator and absent a bathtub (shower only). While the bed was comfortable, the two tiny pillows were inadequate and the sharp bed frame corners mentioned by other reviewers were found repeatedly by my wife. I was most disturbed by the lack of adequate soundproofing in the windows. From our room at the back of the hotel every early-morning-dumpster-emptying in the alley we faced reverberated thoughout the room. There was no need for this as proper windows would have alleviated the problem. Further regarding the service, on our second morning the restaurant server attempted to seat us at the first table just inside the doorway. We were reluctantly allowed to sit at a table farther back in the less than half-full room. This annoyance may be the reason our server never returned with the only thing we ordered from her (juice). And the one cup of coffee we were served at seating must have been our entire ration as well. Curiously, the only time our server did return was with a check for $0.00 with a line for a tip on it. Finally, on our second night most of the towels disappeared from our bathroom. Even though we had hung up our towels for reuse (California water shortage), all but two of our towels were taken and not replaced. Upon questioning the desk clerk on checkout we were told that there was a towel shortage that day. Very strange. The bottom line is that I liked The Orchard and I'll stay there again.

For me, the hotel is in a perfect location. Right next to the Powell/Market cable line which brings you to Fisherman's Wharf (the only reason to take it down there really is to go to Alcatraz). But, Market Street is well within walking distance (just 5 blocks away) and from there you can catch a bus or subway to anywhere in the city. So, location is excellent. As far as the homeless than some mention, yes, you will see a few from time to time, however, I was never once approached by any of them. Listen, this is San Francisco, and, sadly, homelessness is part of the scene no matter where you go in the City. If you go into Haight/Ashbury you'll really see what homelessness is all about - and I loved the Haight/Ashbury area. They are people like everyone else. They don't bother you. Enough about that. Union Square is literally just two blocks away. The Sunday morning I was there they had an art festival/exhibit. It was great. Lots of local artists. There are also a vast variety of restaurants/bars in very close proximity to The Orchard. OK. The hotel itself was great. Very courteous front desk staff and doormen. I had a room on the 8th floor overlooking the corner of Powell and Bush Streets. What more could you ask for? I could watch the cable cars run through the intersection every few minutes. Ask for a higher floor on Bush Street and you won't be disappointed (no street-level noise and great views). I thought the bed was very comfortable, but you know, everybody has their own opinion on what a comfortable bed is based on firmness. I will warn you, however, be prepared to ask for at least 2 additional pillows. They provide 4 pillows (for a king size) and they are tiny and flat. That is really my biggest complaint, but not really a complaint since they promptly provided me with the additional pillows, which ended up being enough for me to sleep comfortably. An additional note about the bed. The matresses lie upon a wood frame. Because of the configuration of the room, I banged my shin on the corner of the wood frame (nearest the desk) at least 5 times. (I wouldn't have been a good subject for Pavlov - LOL). My right shin was black and blue, but I finally started being careful on the second day and didn't do anymore damage! The room was very clean. The bathroom in perfect working order and very clean.

Linens are mostly very good, but not consistently so there was invariably one scratchy pillowcase or a rough sheet in with the lovely Frette bedding. Staff was competent. This is a bit petty, but I had mentioned when I made the reservation that we would be celebrating our 10th anniversary, so I was a little disappointed that there wasn't so much as a 'congratulations, thanks for staying with us' card in our room. But, for this price, I'm not complaining about the details. All in all the Orchard is a great hotel. We got a $119 rate as quoted on quikbook (we booked it through the hotel itself, not the website).

What's the big deal? Yes, the rooms were decent, but no better than many other hotels I've seen. In fact, the first room they put me in was on the 3rd floor with a wonderful view of a building wall across the street and dumpsters on the street. (Of course, in SF it's hard to tell whether you're looking at garbage bins or just the normal street trash; this is one of the dirtiest cities this side of New Orleans.) Getting back to the hotel itself, I arrived around 7:00 pm -- not particularly late -- and was greeted by the doorman. Checked in and asked about a restaurant recommendation, and was told I could call the \"concierge\" when I got to my room. I did, but all buttons on the phone lead to the front desk, no matter which department you think you're calling. The front desk person said the \"concierge\" was on a break and would call me back in 5 minutes. I did get a call back in 5 minutes, but the \"concierge\" sounded suspiciously like the doorman who had carried my bag into the hotel. When I asked for a recommendation of a Thai restaurant, he said \"Oh, you want Asian food?\" No, Thai food. He couldn't think of a Thai restaurant in the area. So I gave him the list I'd printed out from the Internet. He wasn't familiar with any of them. I ended up finding a nice Thai place just three blocks away that this \"concierge/doorman\" apparently had never noticed. As for cleanliness, I used the tag to indicate that I wanted them to change the bed linens, but it was clear that they had not done so when I returned. In fact, when I checked the bathroom, they hadn't cleaned the toilet, either. So I can't give the maid service high marks, either. Decent hotel, quiet, good location, but I certainly did not feel pampered or feel that they had their act together on guest services. I'd like a concierge who is more familiar with the restaurants in the area than I am, and a maid service that actually cleans my room thoroughly. Oh, one more thing: The \"exercise room\" is just a 2nd-floor hotel room -- just like any other room in the hotel -- with 3 pieces of equipment and a water cooler.

We chose to try Orchard because of the good reviews we've read and affordable room rate. Overall, we had a good stay. To start out, the hotel has pre-assigned our room and left a red wine bottle and 4-piece box of chocolate on the top of the bar counter which was a thougthful touch. Though it didn't feel personalized like some top hotels with your names in a card signed and welcomed by the manager, which was all right. Didn't experience the turn-down service as listed in the inclusives. Pros: Like the other previous tripadvisor reviewers have mentioned: Sometimes you could get very affordable rates, good location in walking distance minutes to the foot of Chinatown and Union Square and other downtown areas, but the location is less noisy than those areas. The famed Masa's restaurant is across the street. Many inclusives like free internet access, DVD player with free DVD rental at the front desk. It really felt like home because we found out the in-room Sony TV is similar to ours at home and used the same remote control; lots of TV channels including free HBO. The room & bathroom are of medium comfortable sizes, not small like other city hotels. The hotel claims all rooms are of the same sizes. The booking agent was friendly and helpful, so were the front desk staffs and bellmen. And the mattress was one of the most comfortable ones we've ever experienced in hotel beds. It sit on a solid wood plateform bed frame. We had a good rest. Cons: We used tripadvisor hoping to find a good rate and it was all sold out and also checked the hotel's own website which listed very desirable valuable packages. But I couldn't book on line so I called the hotel directly only to be told that those packages weren't available because it was a conference week and few rooms were left -- Demand and supply. I'd recommend the hotel to get the Specials page off if that's the case. Thin door: You could hear the noises from the hallway. Thin-walled restrooms: You could hear next door's turning on/off the facet. Parking fee is $30 plus tax that runs up to $34.00.

We booked through the Orchard's website and paid $149.00 per night (AAA rate) for a king deluxe room and this included valet parking for two nights & free breakfast. I requested a high floor as far from the street as possible with a street view, in case of noise. We received a floor on the 9th floor (there are only 10 floors) with street view and it was nice and quiet. Our car was always brought around within 20 minutes of our calling down for it. The room was clean, large and nicely furnished. The two feather pillows provided were awful and far too small for the king bed so after the first night, I called housekeeping for better pillows and 5 minutes later I was brought three larger (much better) pillows and we slept so much better that night. The surround sound system was sort of a waste since all the speakers were crowded on a shelf together above the TV. The bathroom was large by S.F. standards and the quartz(?) countertops & marble tile inlay in the ceramic tile floor was a nice touch. The blowdryer was fairly worthless to me, however, so consider bringing your own if you want to dry your hair in less than an hour's time.

You can easily walk the distance from Powell Street although the last block is quite steep. A couple of warnings, both relating to food. I really enjoyed the breakfast here. It was continental - cereals, fruit, hard boiled eggs, cold cut meats, cute little mini-muffins and bagels and the like - so don't expect the frieds eggs and bacon. I was there for four nights and the breakfasts, although good, did start to get boring as they were exactly the same every morning. I actually heard one guest ask if the breakfast ever changed. The hotel waiter said it did relatively often, at which time the guest retorted that he had stayed there 5 nights so far and not a single thing had changed! A small blemish though. The other thing has nothing to do with this hotel, but more to do with San Francisco generally. In London, I am used to being able to get get dinner whenever I want it. On a couple of occasions, we tried to go out for dinner after 9pm only to have pretty much every good restaurant be closed. It was admittedly during the week, but I was shocked that I could not dine at that time of night. At many of the top restaurants in London, a 10pm sitting is not at all unusual.

The only part that left me a little disappointed was the free breakfast. They told us that a free breakfast was included with the room, but it was no big deal, it was just a continental breakfast. When they left out the part about it being continental, I had grand visions of choice omelets and French toast smothered in powder sugar and real maple syrup. No such luck. Oh well.

First off the location is GREAT! Close to Chinatown, and Union Square, if you want, take a short 10-15 minute cable car ride, which stops right outside the hotel, to North Beach, the Wharf or many of the other neighborhoods in the area. A cab ride to the Wharf runs about $10 with tip, so if it's cold or your in a hurry to get somewhere, hop in a cab and your on your way. The property is close walking distance to Chinatown, Macy's, Neimans, and all the great shopping in Union Square. My wife having forgotten an item found it very fortuante to have such great shops available to complete her outfit for the night, we hustled down to Macy's got what she needed, giggled all the way back up the hill and rewarded ourselves with a Margarita on the walk back to the hotel. Though the neighborhood at first glance seems crusty, it is all part of the quiet and charming part of San Francisco, you become just part of the neighborhood. The hotel is fine, but nothing to shout about, it's all about charm, quick elevators, easy access to the many neighborhoods, the helpful staff, comfortable rooms, simple breakfast, Again, location is what we were looking for, when you're trying to cram as much as you can into 2 1/2 days this is a great choice.

We (family of 4 incl. 2 teens) checked into the Orchard around 9PM a coupel of days before Labor Day weekend. It's very conveniently located a block and a half up the hill from Union Square. We had booked our room on the internet and received a email reply confirmation that, at the rate we requested, our family would be accommodated in a standard room. When we checked in, the Orchard's print-out of our reservation only showed two adults for the room, which as it turned out is all a standard room can accommodate. We had no choice but to upgrade to a full one bedroom suite which was all that was left that could accommodate 4 persons. Needless to say, we didn't really budget for another $60 per night for the larger room. That was the bad part. I'm not sure where the fault originated from. Best to confirm internet bookings with a follow up call direct with the hotel. That having been said, the one bedroom suite was marvelous and huge with everything very well appointed (the Orchard gave us a very reasonable break on the rack rate they would normally charge). As I am an architect, and a pretty discerning one at that, I would say the appointments, interior design, materials, furnishings and overall quality are all very well done and that's something I very rarely say. It's not Four Seasons level, but it's very close at less than half the price. This quality is not just limited to the rooms, but includes the Lobby, elevator cab and Dining Room as well. The front desk staff are very friendly and are well groomed. The Dining Room, where we only had the complimentary breakfasts (afterall you're in San Francisco!) is very comfortable and spacious. The food at breakfast, while not outstanding in terms of the menu and degree of preparation required to put it on, was of good quality, fresh and with enough variety to keep anybody happy (although more varieties of fresh fruit for me would have been the icing on the cake). If you rent a car, parking is a killer at $30 per night, but then you're in S. F. which is not car friendly in the downtown area.

The DVD library was a very pleasant perk. The collection is quite good and we never had a problem borrowing a movie. The continental breakfast was also convenient, especially if you're looking for a quick bite to eat before you hit the road.
