{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A wonderful surprise!! The Hotel Villa Ambrosina is a lovely , warm and friendly hotel and staff on a hill overlooking the Chianti region. The view from our room was beautiful. The room was large, nicely decorated. The breakfast room was attractive also and the breakfast was delicious. We wished we could have stayed longer. It is a great location for touring Florence and all of Tuscany. A car is necessary however as the walk up the hill`is only for the very young.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR617516175", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "firstson"}, {"Content": "Dont stay there!!!!!

I wish we had seen the review from the Chicago tripadvisor member about that steep hill before we traveled to Villa Ambrosina!!Don\u9225\u6a9b get me wrong, this is a beautiful hotel set with breathtaking views. There is an adjoining restaurant that has great staff and delicious food. My sister thought the spaghetti dish at the restaurant was one of the best she\u9225\u6a9a had. The room was big and clean and the price was great.BUT (1) we did not realize how far outside of Florence this hotel is located. Our only consolation is that the bus stop is just down the hill and it\u9225\u6a9a a scenic ride.(2) That infamous hill to reach the hotel is no joke! We had to let the hotel staff know how displeased we were to walk up and down the hill in order to get around. A taxi is about 25 euros and can be expensive if you want to do anything away from the hotel. Stay here if you are fit or you plan to rent a car.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR839422547", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "WorldTraveller-Bajan"}, {"Content": "Very nice hotel We stayed at Villa Ambrosina for one night in July. It's a beautiful mansion newly refurbished into a hotel (according to the front desk, they have only been open for 3 months). The rooms are very nicely decorated and well-appointed with stuccoed walls and Tuscan-style furniture and decor. They are larger then average in Italy. Bathrooms are very nice with large showers. Air conditioning was ice cold. The bed was very firm as are most beds in Italy.The hotel is only about 20 minute drive from downtown Florence, and sits on top of a steep hill in a small town of Tavernuzze. It has an ample parking, and a wonderful restaurant next door (although it appears as if attached to the hotel, it is an independent establishment). The breakfast was served in a room upstairs and was about average - just standard continental fare, no eggs or hot dishes.One caveat: bugs. Even though we kept the window closed, mosquitoes still found their way into our room. My girlfriend said she was showering with 4 of them circling overhead. The hotel provided a bug-repellent plug-in (looks like a scented plug for the electrical outlet) - had we used that, we would not have had the mosquito problem. Other than that, our stay was great, and the staff helpful. As for accessibility - do not even think about staying there if you don't have a car, unless you enjoy hiking up a steep hill.", "Date": "Aug 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR409612511", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ladausa"}, {"Content": "Wonderful WE stayed at The Villa Ambrosina on the 13th -16th of May 2006The staff were wonderful, they couldn't have been more helpful.The room was great with a terrific view of the valley of Florence.I hope we get another opportunity to visit this Villa in the very near future, some of our fondest memories of Italy are at this Hotel...Thank you to the staff for making our visit to Italy a very special one!!Julia  Ken Taylor", "Date": "Jun 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR434497674", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Villa Ambrosina under construction When we arrived at this hotel, we found it to be under construction. The 1920's villa they talk about is currently being remodeled. You will be staying in a more recently built hotel on the property. The rooms are clean, of adequate size and the bed was comfortable. The view from the hill the hotel is on, was beautiful. The problems we had were finding the place-it is in the country, and security. We solved the first problem after turning around a few times. The second problem was a little more serious. Our first night, we were confused about how to lock the door. Subsequently, we were visited at 3 am by a person who took a pair of pants off a chair by the door and ran away. The phone in the room was not working at all and when we used our cell phone to call the hotel desk, the person who picked up the phone did not speak any english. The management was informed in the morning of our problem and advised us to keep the door locked.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR221163139", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Veramente un bel posto da...   showReview(22049471, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR614914064", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Pas forc\u8305ment facile \u813f trouver...   showReview(21836791, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR499297980", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bel h\u4e48tel mais nous...   showReview(21766795, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR380054966", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'h\u4e48tel est tr\u732bs agr\u8305able.
