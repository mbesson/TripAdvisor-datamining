We searched for another hotel, confident that at such short notice we should get a good deal on another hotel, We came across the Glendale Hyde Park Hotel's site. It looked small but well maintained and ideally located. The site boasted of it's \"first class accommodation\" and \"warm and friendly welcome to all guests\". We were to be very disappointed. Upon our arrival, we were barely greeted by a man who seemed more concerned by the television program he was engrossed in. After 5-6 minutes of searching for our reservation, he eventually found it and informed us that although the room was ready, we were 45 minutes before their agreed checkin time so we would have to come back. When we came back, we were brought to a room in the basement floor of the hotel. the room consisted of a bed and a bathroom. No window and a door linking it to the next room (we would later discover that this door allowed us to hear every breath of the guests next door). Breakfast (included in the rate we paid) consisted of toast, filter coffee, orange juice or cold hard-boiled eggs. The breakfast room was similar to hostels I have stayed in over the years. I might add at this stage that we certainly did not pay hostel prices!! Upon leaving, the man at the desk (not the same as on our arrival) looked up at us and said goodbye (again, engrossed in whatever was on the tv).

On our 1st stay we were on the top floor & the stairs were 'interesting' for my husband who has bad knees but the desk clerk helped, The 2nd time we stayed there the hotel was overbooked but they squeezed us into a small room in the basement- not great, very small bathroom, but well maintained. The breakfast in the morning was simple but of unlimited amounts in the time alloted. I particularly liked the international nature of the guests. Internet worked (the desk clerk was very patient with me) & the small lobby was often filled with guests who were hanging out- all very friendly. The price is low so don't expect alot of frills or space but what there is, is good.", "Date": "October 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay in thid hotel again under any circumstancesl\u201d", "Author": "Chabenet", "ReviewID": "UR5966838", "Content": "At \u00c2\u00a365 a night for a double room in Central London I certainly wasn't expecting luxury but I certainly wasn't expecting a cramped pokey room in the basement where the toilet could only be used by sitting sideways. The bedside lamp was hanging off the wall and there was only one dirty blue plastic cup in bathroom. Luckily my husband and I are of normal proportions - anyone slighty overwight would have great difficulty in managing in these conditions. I usually book toursist class hotels and have got some good deals in the past- however the weekend of 13-15 October was very busy which is why I ended up in the Glendale. I am just sorry I didn't pay more for better accommodation as it spoit a very good weekend in London.
