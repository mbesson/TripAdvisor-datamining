Upon arriving to this hotel, I was intrigued by the brown stone style buildiing, and the warm and cozy lobby area. However, after exhaustively carrying our own luggage up the long and seemingly neverending staircase, we enter our small standard room, and are immediately overcome by a strong mildew stench that was coming from the bathroom. The shower head had green mold on it. We bought Lysol and ended up cleaning the bathroom thoroughly, ourselves. The carpet was stained from what seemed to be water damage. After we sprayed the room with air freshener, we hoped that we can begin to enjoy our trip to Montreal. However, unfortunatately this was not the case. Our first night, we were extremely hot. We had the window wide open (it was cold outside, since it was late November), yet no air seemed to get in. I had to sleep with a washcloth that was soaked with ice water around my neck. We had no control over the temperature in the room, and the hotel pumped heat through the hotel and made the room feel like it was 90 degrees. The extreme heat continued for the rest of the trip. On our second night, we were kept up by this strange loud humming sound that was coming from the shower. In addition to the noises and heat, a terrible mattress and horrible pillows contributed to the poor sleep I received. Every morning, I woke up with a sore neck, and I'm still sore after being home for two days. Also, at 7:30 am every morning, we were woken up by someone doing construction in the side of the building. I know this is not under the hotel's control, but it did add to our frustrations nontheless. We ended up accidentally dropping the one bar of soap in the toilet, and we never were given another one, so we ended up buying one at a local store. Overall, this hotel did not make this the vacation we had hoped for, and will be sure to stay at a chain hotel next time, just to be safe. Finally, we asked the front desk for some directions to a few museums in the area, and they seemed to be just as clueless as we were as to how to get around the city.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hot Springs, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "boneman7", "ReviewID": "UR120134746", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor.
