The hotel itself: The rooms were really clean, everything worked just fine, we didn't order the breakfast, so I can't comment on this, the stuff was just excellent and really really helpful. The down sides are I guess the size of the rooms - for my understanding the standard for Paris is 10-12 square netters for double / tween room. I guess our room was a bit larger than that (the website says ~14), but still felt small - I don't think it's a big deal considering the upsides of the hotel. Another thing is the elevator which went out of use for the weekend - we stayed on the fifth flour :-( and besides highly unrecommended for claustrophobic people...

It was remodeled completely within the last 2 years and I suspect the negatives from older reviews were justified with the older building and prior owners. It certainly deserves high praises now. It is two blocks west of the Madeline metro stop, easy to each if you have a map. Its in the middle of the block, you'll miss it unless you look up to see the sign. Many nice small ethnic restaurants on the street. I dined two nights at the Sejong, a Korean restaurant. Also saw a Japanese, Pakistani, and I think and Italian place. The Hotel has a very nicely decorated and friendly lobby. It smelled very clean. I was quickly checked in by a well dressed young man and shown the elevator up to my room. My room was beautifully remodeled with tile bath and separate lav. High ceilings with crown molding and modern central air with room controls. A 24\" flat screen TV is on the wall. Completely free internet via wifi was also provided. The bed was very comfortable and sheets of high quality. My room faced the street and with the windows open, of course, I heard some traffic but closed, nothing to complain about. Its not a major street so noise not an issue unless you have the windows open when the garbage trucks pass at 6 AM ! There was a minibar/refrigerator. No coffee maker in the room, so I had to wait till breakfast for that first cup - arrrg. The breakfast is down stairs in the all brick cellar with curved ceiling, painted white. Its decorated with pictures of 50s to 70's pop rock stars in a nice theme. My only complaint about breakfast - no meat ! As a registered carninvore, I'd like some ham or fish or beef or eggs. There was plenty of fresh bread, cheese, yogurts, cereals, tea, coffee, etc. Perhaps if I'd been a bit more bold and asked, I'm sure the friendly staff in the breakfast room would have found something for me in their own private area. Speaking of being bold and asking, I bet if I'd asked, the hotel staff would have also had a small coffee maker for me to use in the room. I had planned to stay 5 days on business but after 2 days, my circumstances changed and I had to leave early. I explained my situation and there was no charge at all for the cancelled days even though I was a bit late on the 2nd day in telling them I was leaving early. Summary - don't be afraid of 3 stars in this place. Its like a BB but with 6 floors, plenty of privacy. I'd stay again if I had business or vacation plans in that part of Paris.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly Amazing\u201d", "Author": "Ulrick", "ReviewID": "UR94724081", "Content": "I have been to Paris almost every year and most of those times I stayed in an overpriced, crappy, stinky hotels. This hotel though, proved surprisingly different for Paris hotel standard. It may be located in an obscure corner but once you get to know and explore its immediate surroundings, again you'll be surprised to know that this hotel is still right at the heart of Paris. The facade of this hotel doesn\u2019t reveal much but once you entered its reception area, you'll get a hint that they mean to show some proper French accommodation with style. The hotel personnel especially the receptionist, smells delightfully good with their perfume called Professionalism. At some point they might have some difficulties explaining things properly in English but that never stop them from trying further until you get the point. Really commendable. The \u201cSuperior Double room\u201d that I got was not particularly big but it has all the necessary things I look for in a room. I can\u2019t help but to compare my room to a well made espresso, small in size but packs a lot of whooping goodness straight to my veins. The interior of the room was tastefully designed without sacrificing functionality. As for the WC it was delightfully great. I can literally stay in it for hours. The main reason for this is that the bath tub has its own TV with considerable amount of channels. Aside from this, the toilet bowl has its own door so it didn\u2019t bother me while my partner is using the bowl. Lovely isn\u2019t it? Moreover, the room is equipped with WiFi, minibar, safety box, TV and some thoughtful amount of candies on the bedside table.
