Price was reasonable (under $100) and the room was fairly large with a very comfortable king sized bed. The room also had a desk and business chair, and a Lazy boy type chair. The bathroom was clean and good sized.. The staff was excellent. It has free Wi-Fi and a business center,. There's a restaurant there, but we didn't have occasion to use it. The hotel has a complimentary hot breakfast. For us, it was scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, two choices of sausage along with fresh and canned fruit, an assortment of pastries, three types of juice, coffee, cereal, hard boiled eggs and probably a few othre items. The hotel was within 1/2 mile of Silver Dollar City. They have a free shuttle, but since we were just a one night stay, we didn't use it.

This is definitely an older building but the rooms have been updated recently. I was impressed how nice the room felt, especially the bathroom. The beds had a pillow top feel, bedding was clean, and the bed didn't squeak every time I had to get up. It was almost eerily quiet in the room. Would have thought we were the only ones there but a full parking lot attested differently. I could never get the keycard to work but my grandaughter had no trouble with it. The hallways are somewhat institutional, monotone whitewash walls and tired, worn carpeting. The pool area was large, surrounded by windows and sliding glass doors. It was an extremely hot evening so the air flow was welcome. The hot tub is fiberglass and felt clean and temperature correct but the water flow is minimal. Was also nice that I could watch my girls in the pool from the hot tub. Pool hours were great, staying open til midnight. There is a kiddie pool, also. Breakfast fare was pretty standard but the room was above standard with 2 walls of windows and plenty of seating. Beats the usual cubby hole breakfast areas. The staff at the desk are excellent, very friendly. Location is ideal for SDC and being able to enjoy Branson without suffering maddening traffic. It is next to SDC and was great to come back to the room at will to freshen up, rest, and go again. We didn't use the shuttle but can see how that would be nice with little kids and strollers. I would have liked to have had a microwave and fridge but I didn't ask for these specifically. The shampoo sample is tiny considering had 3 women in the room so I was glad I thought to bring my own. Also, if I had gotten a receipt for the room under my door, I wouldn't have had to check out at the desk. Overall, I am happy I chose to stay here.

We drove our own car to Silver Dollar City, but we did see many families with small children taking advantage of the hotel transportation to the park. The parking at Silver Dollar City gets very crowded so it would be a huge plus to get dropped of right in front of the gate and picked up there as well especially if you have small children. Elevators were quick, and the hotel has a luggage cart so you don't have to make multiple trips to and from your car. They will even provide ice for your coolers! The breakfast area was very large and clean, the food was laid out nicely and had a better selection than some of the Best Westerns we've been to. The air conditioner was a little noisy, but we are used to central air at home so I'm sure that's why it woke me up a few times. The beds were wonderful!

This is a quiet hotel. If you want to stay close to Silver Dollar City, this may be your place. There are also lots of condos for rent in the area as well. We found the whole area to be very quiet. The hotel is easy to get to from the strip, but far enough away that you don't have the traffic jam of the strip. Lots of back ways into this sight with NO traffic. They have a big parking lot so you can bring your boat. It is a short drive from the State Park Marina if you want to fish Table Rock Lake. There is an easy back way to the public launch on Tanneycomo if you're going for the trout and don't like the idea of dragging your boat down the strip. I get that. This place is not the Cheateu on the Lake. But the Cheateu is double the price. This place is clean and they treat you like family.

They had eggs, sausage, bisquits and gravy, french toast, fruit, cereal, juices, yogurt, all you can eat. We were really impressed with breakfast and the dining room is huge. We took the 9:30 shuttle to SDC which opened at 10:00. I love that they dropped us right at the front door! We have been to SDC many times, but never at opening. They have a flag raising ceremony with veterans from the crowd that is really neat. The 3:00 shuttle was on time and got went straight to our car which we left parked at the hotel.

I didn't use the pool, but my wife and 10 year old son did. They didn't stay very long since it was very crowded and pool had a lot of chlorine.

This is the main reason we stayed here since traffic has always been a pain for me at SDC, but this made it a breeze. Saturday afternoon my family and I stayed in the room to watch a football game and the housekeepers were very nice and friendly about working around us to clean up the room. We asked for a late check-out on Sunday (1:00) so we could hit SCD in the morning one last time, and it wasn't any problem.

It was also empty whenever we wanted to use it...which was wonderful! Fridges and Micros available for a fee. This is NOT a new hotel. It probably dates back to the 60's.

Though we were a bit apprehensive as we drove up (there were several in our caravan who started joking about the hotel's resemblance to a maximum security prison as we pulled into the parking lot), we were met by super-friendly and accomodating staff. We ended-up needing to play a bit of musical rooms to get our families settled and the staff was very nice about all of our shuffling. That being said, the property itself is a bit ... odd. It's long and low and you feel a bit like a rat in a maze as you navigate from one place to another. Not a problem, just odd. The rooms were fine, with the exception of the lumpy pillows. They were so bad we bought our own at the nearby Walmart. The pool area is nice, but it was REALLY hot in there. My kids (eight and nine years old) loved it, but most of the adults didn't want to hang out in such a steamy place, so the over-20 crowd steered clear. The reason I had to give this location a \"poor\" rating and NOT recommend it is that the breakfast is appalling. First off, the hotel uses styrofoam plates, bowls and cups, and plastic cutlery. Hello, people -- are you living under a rock or do you just not care about overflowing landfills and the overall health of the planet? Disposable is just plain lazy and irresponsible. Shame on you. Besides, it's just plain icky to eat and drink with that stuff. Again, we made a trip to Walmart for some cheap glasses, mugs and cutlery for our family. And speaking of icky, the only edible thing here is the cereal. Boiled eggs are the sole protein source offered (aside from milk), and whoever prepares them must boil them for at least half an hour in order to achieve their rubber-like consistency. Inedible. The biscuits are salty enough to curl your tounge. Also inedible. There isn't a single whole grain to be found anywhere near the buffet area. Coffee is weak, fruit is canned and weird -- are those potatoes in there?? Really, how hard is it to put out some whole wheat bread, fresh bananas and apples and maybe a little yogurt? And what's the problem with using uncut oatmeal instead of that instant stuff if you're cooking it in a crock pot anyway? Giving a little thought to nutrition and conservation would go a long way here.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "FL", "Title": "\u201cCheck your credit card statement for duplicate billing\u201d", "Author": "SAR17", "ReviewID": "UR27326069", "Content": "We were double billed on our credit card for a one night stay.

The deciding factor for me was the response he gave to the lady from Overland Park who could not find anything good about the place. That was classic and expressed my feelings exactly!!! The motel was nice, clean, and quiet. It was close to Silver Dollar City and a visit there was on our agenda. We were VERY appreciative of the shuttle bus especially after we witnessed the Christmas traffic to SDC on Saturday evening. The staff were friendly and more than helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We cannot speak to the pool (although it LOOKED nice) since we did not use it.

We were booked for a second night as well that we ended up cancelling. The hotel is very convenient to Silver Dollar City. The double room itself and the bathroom were very clean. The lobby is nice. We did not check out the pool area. Parking is good and no matter where your room is, it is accessible with little or no hassel. The beds are rock hard. They are bad enough that if I layed on my side, my arm and shoulder would start to ache and I would wake up. We had no blanket either on the beds or in the closet. The beds had a sheet and a comforter, and everyone knows not to use the comforter. The pillows were very nice however. It is an older hotel and it shows. The breakfast is barely edible. It consists of pre-made french toast and english muffins. Both are cold and sit next to a 4 slot toaster to be rewarmed. Don't get in a hurry if you need to rewarm your food because there is, no doubt, room for a traffic jam at the toaster. The french toast crumbles when you pick it up. There was also plain bread to make toast. There were biscuits and gravy. The gravy was fine. The bicuits are also pre-made. The bottom half inch of every biscuit we picked up was rock hard. We had to cut the bottom off to eat them to keep our teeth intact. There was cold cereal and milk, doughnuts, canned fruit of some sort, oatmeal, both pre-made in a crockpot and individual packets to mix with hot water, juices, coffee and hot tea. I tried the french toast, biscuits and gravy, cereal and coffee. The cereal and coffee were fine. There is a computer for public use. Do not expect to find it available. There were always children surfing the web, or on two occasions we tried to use it, there was an employee sitting there using it. In the less than 24hrs we were there, we tried to use the computer 7 times.
