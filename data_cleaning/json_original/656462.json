Pool area is really nice! Room was a decent size, but felt a bit overcrowded because of all the furniture in it (desk with chair, chair with ottoman, bench, etc.) The fridge and microwave were wonderful!!! Our room was a non-smoking room, but the hallway was so full of smoke - either from bad venting or from people smoking out there - that our room smelled smokey a majority of the time. It smelled like it was coming right in the bathroom vent, so we closed the bathroom door and this helped some. Breakfast is okay especially if you are trying to save a little time or money. The smokiness was a major turnoff and I would not recommend this hotel to any non-smoker.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Lee V", "ReviewID": "UR124760288", "Content": "This hotel is a great stay with great amenities.

Here's the good and bad: Pro's- The pool is awesome! Very warm, clean, and really large for a hotel this size. The jacuzzi was the perfect temperature and the pool is open 24 hours, except for kids under age 18 it is only open until 11. GREAT pool area! The staff was friendly and tried to be helpful, but didn't seem to know much about the area. The hotel was just off the highway but very quiet and had a nice homey feel to it. There's nice quiet sitting areas with lamps all around the lobby so you can sit and hang out. There's also a nice little \"living room\" in the lobby with couches and a TV where you would feel comfortable just coming and hanging out. The room was very clean and larger than a normal king room. Although not huge, the room did have a king bed, and also a sitting area that allowed plenty of room for our child to spread his toys out. The bathroom sink is seperate from the shower and toilet, which is nice with a little one. The shower had a tub, which is also nice with a child. All the rooms have a fridge and microwave, which we loved! The decor was a little outdated but not a big deal for us. This is the first hotel we haven't had a flat screen TV in, they had the old tube type TV that didn't have the best picture. But, still worked fine and my son didn't seem to care! They do have a small fitness room that isn't fancy but will get the job done. There was one treadmill, one bike, and one eliptical machine. It is also open 24 hours. Con's; The hotel doesn't seem to be in a real \"suburban\" area, meaning there wasn't any of your staple stores (grocery, Target, restaurants, Walmart, etc) really close. We ended up driving about 10-15 mins to find major restaurants and stores, but once we found them there was everything you would need. If you head about 10-15 west from the hotel it is a sketchy area and I wouldn't take my family anywhere near that area of town. We were on the search for a restaurant and found ourselves in an area that we weren't comfortable with. The front desk staff didn't seem to know much about the area or the local festivals etc. I recommend using your computer to find what you want to do and not rely on the staff for their help. The breakfast was just ok, nothing fancy. It did save us money and time as we could just eat there but the choices were slim and not excitingm, especially for those of us trying to eat healthy. There were waffles, pastries, bread and bagels, a few cereal choices, yucky looking apples, watered down juice, and a few other things. Nothing exciting and no one really keeping things stocked and straightened. If you want some healthy choices, bring your own food. There was nothing there for me to eat. The fresh fruit looked like it had been around for a few days.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baldwinsville, New York", "Title": "\u201cpleasant\u201d", "Author": "scooby-BTR", "ReviewID": "UR121106039", "Content": "have stayed here for 3 years in a row as I attend the FDIC show as a vendor. our corporate HQ is just down the street so staying here is very convenient. staff friendly and nice. room always great.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "springfield,ohio", "Title": "\u201cFirst stay, won't be the last.\u201d", "Author": "sengstock", "ReviewID": "UR118587707", "Content": "Clean room with very comfortable bed and bedding.
