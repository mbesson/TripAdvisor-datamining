This apartment-hotel is one of your best options staying in the fashion district of Berlin and with many interesting shops & restaurants at your doorstep. The apartment is close to underground stations for exploring other parts of Berlin. You get more space for your money (115 euro) than in far more expensive hotelrooms or -suites. This is good value in Berlin Mitte. But if you object to a hard bed go elsewhere. The rooms get hot in summer, fortunately four large windows (three with a view of the famous communication tower of Berlin-landmark) can be opened. There is also a fan. Park your car in one of the busy streets near the apartment with a parkingpermit of the hotel (8 euro).

The apartment was furnished with every imaginable amenity (except an air-con but there was a fan) like iron and board, vacuum cleaner, real blow dryer, DVD player with small TV, etc. The kitchen is furnished with a stove, oven, dishwasher, fridge, microwave, toaster, pots,pans etc. although no oil,salt, etc., and not even vessel detergent to clean dishes. The apartment was done up in a charming fashion but we were disappointed to find 2 double beds instead of the single king we asked for. Like most apts., they only clean when you leave, and don't change towels either. The croissants and tea/coffee every morning downstairs were great supplemented with the cereal-milk we bought from Netto supermarket (5-7 minute walk). The location is in a fun area with some happening nightclubs and restaurants, and there are 2/3 subways close by although we only used Weinmeisterstrasse-this we found inconvenient as the Berlin metro is pretty complicated and we would have to always make a change at Alexanderplatz (which is also supposed to be walkable distance but we never tried). The lady at the reception was super helpful. I gave her a load of clothes for machine wash (8 euros) but since their dryer was broken, she charged me nothing, and hung the mostly dry clothes in my apartment on her clothes line with a very sweet apology letter. The free wifi was great, and although they give a password for one machine, one can ask them for more, free of charge. As for location, one has to eat at Monsieur Vuong (10 steps from hotel) for the best Vietnamese (or other) meal of their life! My superlative-hating husband said it was the best meal he'd ever had. Great c/mocktails too. Flower's was a great experience and great value at 106 Euros a night.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value & service.

The apartments are well-priced and in a very convenient location. With three of us in our party, we had a one room and a two room apartment. Both were spacious and stylishly furnished. We had a great view from the larger apartment of the telecommunications tower and down Alte Schonhauser Strasse. Some of the other reviewers have commented on the breakfast (rolls and coffee from the reception area). We found this a very convenient way to start the day. Both were excellent - no-one does bread as well as the Germans. The hotel information I saw before I booked and the receptionist when we checked in took great care to specify that it was not a full breakfast but sufficient to tide you over until you find a cafe for a fullsize breakfast (if that is your thing - the coffee, croissants and buns were sufficient for us). The apartments are well placed - within an easy walk of a range of quirky and trendy shops and restaurants and also to the Dom and Pergamon and other major sites. The location is also very well serviced by public transport with three different Metro lines within easy walking distance.

They did the booking, so I did not have any expectations about breakfast - I must say however, that I was disappointed to read the review (after my stay) that complained about breakfast being included - I agree wholeheartedly that rolls and coffee at reception (which doesn't open until 8:30, well past breakfast for many people) does not equal breakfast! Further, there are two entrances to the hotel, and the section that our apartment was in is not connected directly to reception, so we actually had to go down to the street and around the corner to the reception. Aside from the breakfast issue, though, our experience was generally excellent. We had a few minor issues at the beginning of our stay, but the staff was helpful in resolving them. We appreciated an apartment to call home while in Berlin, much more convenient than a hotel room. Everything was very clean, comfortable furniture, a good look and feel to the apartment (modern, not institutional looking), a good set of utensils in the kitchen, huge windows, etc. We had a problem with the wireless internet, not being able to connect for the first 3 days of our stay, but the problem was eventually fixed. This was inconvenient as some of us were trying to do work while we were there. Location - excellent.
