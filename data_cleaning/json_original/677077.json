The appartment was really big - it would suite at least 3 persons, while I was alone. A lot of space, large bathroom, wardrobe, fridge. However rennovation is extrimelly needed: everything is old and of a poor quality. Location is the best if you visit exhibition at MesseBerlin - few steeps away. Breakfast is not bed, but no hot dishes at all. Price is main advantage of this accommodation: I paid EUR 60.00 per day for my large appartment.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "KIMRICHES3", "Title": "\u201cNever felt so uncomfortable\u201d", "Author": "KIMRICHES3", "ReviewID": "UR40796757", "Content": "The only saving grace for this place is the location. It is conveniently located a few minutes walk from the Messe. The building a run down with a shoddy lift. The room was small and it had stains all over the walls.

We looked for a double room, but they had free only an apartment, so we decided to save more money bringing some food from home (we came by car) and cooking there. Because we thought that an apartment would contain what is needed to cook and eat, but we were wrong: there was one small pot, two pie dishes, but no forks, no pans and not even a table to eat on! When we complained about this they told us that in the past some cookware had been stolen, so they stopped buying new one: what about checking the apartment when people left?!? But the worst has to come: we arrived at the hotel pension Gribnitz and they asked to be paid in advance, although the apartment was in another building, so we could not check it. We were told that there was some restoration works going on in the stairs, but this did't bother us so much. The problem was that the restoration works had just ended also inside the apartment, where the smell of varnish was terribly intense and disgusting. They had left the windows open (probably they had finished painting the same morning) and when we closed them (it was december...) it became worse. We complained but the staff didn't even think about a possible solution: they looked as if the problem wasn't theirs. We stayed in the room as little as we could, but each time we came back the smell was sickening. To complete the review: the room (I can't call it an apartment just because we had two hotplates) was quite large with a small bathroom. Windows didn't close well. It is very close to the U-bahn, but it takes half an hour of U-train to the city center. We had also breakfast included, but we had to go to the hotel, which was 1 block away, so we never went. In conclusion: I don't know anything about the hotel rooms, but the staff is really unhelpful and I would never recommend the apartments of hotel Gribnitz!", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel-Pension Gribnitz", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d677077-Reviews-Hotel_Pension_Gribnitz-Berlin.html", "Price": "$55 - $98*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kaiserdamm 82</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">14057 </span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "677077", "ImgURL": ""}}
