The pools, golf course, bar(s), lobby, rooms, etc. We're diamond members and were upgraded to a gorgeous suite with views of the golf course, pools on one side and on the other a lovely view of the parking deck and downtown disney in the distance. (nice if you want to see fireworks at night). In our suite, we had a huge bathroom with a soaking tub and shower, a separate bedroom, living room with sofa bed, dining area and wet bar with expresso maker and over sized mini-fridge. My son especially loved the doorbell :) We had issues with a lot of miscommunication between the front desk and housekeeping. It took forever to get what we needed whenever we called, and for the duration of our stay the hotel did not have any wash cloths. Strange for a Waldorf. They actually finally found a few for us that they borrowed from the Hilton next door! Room service was also an issue. We ordered mac and cheese for our child and a cheeseburger for me. After an hour, we called to see where the food was. No record of the order. A few minutes later the room service manager called to inform us that the order had been sent to the Hilton-so they said they would start over and comp us for the mac and cheese. I felt the entire order should be comped considering this situation-but, it didn't matter because our son was already asleep-it had been 2 hours by now. So, we cancelled the mac and cheese and stuck with the cheeseburger. I had to ask to have it comped, which I thought was kind of tacky considering the situation. But, it was comped and arrived within a half hour and it was very good. Aside from that, the rest of our stay was wonderful. All of the staff was pleasant, cheery and helpful. No surly, bored or irritated people working at this hotel-which was nice, considering the fact that the place was over run with families with kids running around everywhere. The fabulous thing that we discovered was the fact that even though the waldorf pools were gorgeous and there were children swimming there, adjacent to the hotel is the orlando Hilton and they have a zero entry lazy river pool, water slide and great area for families with kids. Excellent poolside food/beverage service, plenty of big, fluffy pool towels and to top it all off-when it got dark, their was a giant movie screen set up and everyone was treated to a movie while they swam around and played at the pool. We were also able to order take out and have it delivered to the Hilton's front lobby and take it to the pool where we had pizza one night for dinner. A great option when you're spending hundreds a day at Disney, etc. So, stay at the Waldorf for the beauty and upscale ambience (and high prices) and play next door at the Orlando HIlton. Whether you're looking for a quiet, romantic time chilling by the pool in your private cabana ($$) at the Waldorf or playing over at the HIlton with the kids-it's a winning combination. They also have comfy free bus transportation all day long to the Disney parks.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "travelermia", "ReviewID": "UR128280408", "Content": "One of the best hotel experiences ever.

I am now completely spoiled and I wonder how any other hotel will live up to this stay. From the moment we checked in, the service was impeccable! We've stayed at several Four Season Hotels in the past, and still, I was blown away. We took a very early flight in and arrived before 11 AM. We were checked right in and given a 15th floor room with views of all the parks and their firework displays. The room was gorgeous! The bed was heaven (though I do favor the bed at the Four Seasons). And the bathroom was very large and meticulously clean! We mentioned our oldest had just turned 6 and when we arrived back from The Magic Kingdom on our first day, there were cupcakes, a card and a gift waiting for her in the room. Just another example of how they really go above and beyond in terms of service. The location is perfect! We rented a car and we were literally minutes outside of every park! Just and FYI, navigation took us to the wrong location. Be sure to use the actual address and not just the Waldorf Orlando that may come up as a selection. We were there for 6 days and only spent 2 of those days at the pool. Both of my girls had a blast! The pool was not crowded at all. I was expecting spring break being chaos with children everywhere. Not the case here! It was delightful and relaxing! My husband and I were able to enjoy ourselves as well. I seriously debated on staying at the Hilton next door simply because I knew my kids would love the slide and lazy river. I'm so glad I went with the Waldorf! The Hilton pool was exactly what I imaged spring break would be. It was nice to be able to leave that behind after a couple hours and go back over to our pool. The food and drinks at the hotel were also incredible. My husband thought the breakfast buffet was one of the most amazing spreads he has ever seen. So such to choose from and delish!

I agree with other travellers that you need to look out for signs for the Bonnet Creek Resort otherwise the hotel is not the easiest to find. Anyway we arrived mid afternoon and was greeted by valet parking who efficiently emptied the car and whisked it away. There is no self parking but if you're staying at the Waldorf why would you want that anyway? We initially had a Deluxe Disney View room with twin Queen beds which was on the top floor so fantastic views. As a Hilton Honors member I had requested an upgrade to a suite but sadly none was available. We were on the Wandering Wizards package which included breakfast and a Harry Potter wand toy for my son. I discreetly asked at reception about the wand as I wanted it as a surprise for my son and was told that it would be ready and waiting for him in the room. He was very excited about a surprise gift and raced up to the room. Unfortunately he hunted the room but couldn't find the gift. I rang down to reception and had to explain (and spoilt the surprise) and they said they would send it up. What wasn't mentioned was the toy needs batteries to work so he couldn't use it anyway. I know this sounds minor and it is, but it sets the tone. I thought a 5 star hotel would consider small things like this that make a huge difference to a little boy. The room was excellent and well equipped although I noticed the Nexpresso maker only had two pods of decaf coffee and very little milk left. We dined at the Bull and Bear and agree with other reviewers that although excellent food, the menu was very limited, expensive, with little choice for children. Our meal for three (two adults one child) was $ 160 + and that was with only two glasses of wine. The pool at the Waldorf and adjacent Hilton were great. My son particularly liked the lazy river. You could hire inflatable rings to float round at $5. The pool staff at both hotels were very good and efficient in taking orders for drinks etc. The cocktails were well made and we were asked regularly if we needed anymore. We had breakfast included within our package and were given a voucher for two adults when I checked in. I didn't query this at the time as I presumed my son would have been included. I was a bit surprised to receive a bill at breakfast of $18 for my son. I queried it with the waiting staff but was told to raise it with reception. The breakfast was very good with an extensive selection of hot or cold food. The chef at the omelette station was great and cooked exact to order. The following day we returned to our room after a day out and although the room had been serviced we were surprised to note that our dirty coffee cups from the morning were still there and we had been left with no coffee replacements or any milk. I rang down and some were brought up immediately. We also tried to use the in room safe but unfortunately the previous guests had left it in locked mode. I called down and was told that a security guard would be up to unlock the safe so we could use it. After about 45 minutes I rang down again to chase up the security guard as we were keen to go out. The guest services operator apologised and security was at our door within 5 minutes and sorted the problem. Our flight home was delayed by 24 hours so I asked if our stay could be extended and as we'd already packed our bags asked if a suite was now available. I was told that would be no problem but my original upgrade request could not be honoured and I would have to pay the rate as a new booking. $469 + taxes. I agreed and was told a bellman would be up to help move our bags to the new room in a few minutes with two new keys. After 20 minutes I called down again and a bellman arrived but no keys so he had to let us in with his access key. The room was amazing and although expensive was very spacious and what I expect of the Waldorf. Unfortunately our extension did not include breakfast so that made it. Very expensive night. The final annoyance was on the final day and after agreeing a late check out which had been part of our earlier package our room key didn't work. I went down to reception (from the 15th floor) and she apologised and 'zapped' it again. I returned back to the room.....and guess what....the key still didn't work. I traipsed back to reception which had approx 4 staff members standing around and she zapped it again and said she would send up a security guard again if it still didn't work. What really surprised me is that not one member of staff offered to accompany me back upstairs. Also the security guard didn't turn up. The above examples sound like a catalogue of complaints and fairly minor in nature and I agree, individually, they are small but added together it spoilt the end of our trip. Also at the price paid I simply do not expect amateur service. I have stayed at the Waldorf in NYC in the past few months and the service was exceptionally good. I am a traveller who is happy to pay a premium for good service but will have to secure a very good deal to return to this hotel again. There are hotels at half the price very near by who offer excellent service. It is such a shame as the complacency from some staff reflects poorly on the others.

We could not have planned this trip any better. From the moment we stepped in the staff EVERYWHERE was courteous, kind, helpful, literally jumping to serve us in any way they could. Upon check in they offered us vouchers for the breakfast and several vouchers for spa services. The hotel is beautifully appointed. The beds are incredible. The housekeeping staff was extremely thorough -- they service your room in the morning and in the evening. It was always beautiful. The grounds around the hotel are immaculate. Our room overlooked the beautiful golf course and brick paved walking path. There is a very nice fitness room but the hotel complex, which includes the Waldorf and it's sister property the Hilton, is surrounded with beautiful walking/biking/jogging paths with park benches along the way if you would rather walk/run outside. The Hilton is connected by both outside sidewalks and interior corridors and guests may use facilities at either hotel --- pool, fitness room, restaurants, etc. The pool at the Waldorf was always full as there were many families there during our stay but the pool attendants were bountiful and they did an incredible job of helping to find seating, keeping chairs ready for guests, etc. I never had any trouble finding seating at the pool. The hotel also offers bikes and surreys for use. With the lovely paths this is definitely a plus. The rooms were magnificent and the bathrooms very large and very beautifully decorated as well. As with any 5 star, robes and slippers were in the rooms as well as a Nesesspresso machine and a nice selection of coffees as well as a mini fridge. The breakfast buffet was absolutely incredible!!!!! I don't understand the \"negative\" written by another reviewer. We ate at the buffet four mornings and there was never a line anywhere. Homemade maple syrup is not of the same texture as \"Mrs. Butterworths.\" It does have a more natural watery consistency because there is no high fructose corn syrup in it. The buffet had every imaginable item you could possibly conceive for breakfast on it and everything on it was homemade. There was an omelet station with about 12 items you could select for your omelet, a waffle station, a crepe' station, 8 different types of fresh fruit, smoked salmon with several cream cheese varieties and 4 or 5 different bagel varieties. There were scrambled eggs, fingerling potatoes, crisp bacon, beautiful sausage links, and french toast. There was also a huge selection of homemade pastries --- AT LEAST 30 different things, all homemade at Oscars -- croissants, chocolate croissants, Swedish croissants, banana nut bread, various muffins, etc etc etc. Seriously, there were too many to even remember. They also had three or four different cereals (for children, I'm sure) as well as an incredible homemade granola with additional toppings you could add. Then there was the \"bread station\" with about 8 different types of homemade breads which you could toast or eat cold along with butter and different homemade jams. There was also an assorted olive tray, with a variety of cheeses and salamis. The highlight of the breakfast for me was the \"Juice Bar.\" This bar included 6 different freshly made juices each morning. They have someone who works full time all morning just to make the juices ---Apple /Kiwi, Apple/Pomegrante, Watermelon, Orange/Strawberry, Pear/Honeydew, Orange/Carrot. Of course, just plain Orange or Apple juice was also available. The weather was beautiful while we were there so each morning we enjoyed having breakfast on the patio and lingering for an hour or so with our coffee and juices. I really can't say enough how incredibly wonderful the entire staff of this hotel was. We used the Disney Shuttle several different days and it was punctual to the minute both at the hotel and at the parks, going and coming. From the valet attendants, to the door attendant, to the front desk, pool attendants, housekeeping ---- ALL were incredible and extremely professional and helpful.

We have stayed at the Hilton Bonnet Creek (it is next door) previously, but just couldn't remember how to get there. I called the hotel, and they gave us a different street name to use. Worked perfectly. I would definitely suggest calling before your trip if you are driving. First impression: The lobby is gorgeous!! Beautiful marble and tile floors. Definitely a contemporary feel. Check-in went smoothly. Super friendly staff. Mandatory $20 valet parking system. This was one of the only negatives about this resort. Positives: Heavenly bed!!! Beautiful room. Gorgeous bathroom with separate tub/glass shower. Drawers in the vanity, which was such a plus! Robes, slippers, Salvatore Ferragmo toiletries and lighted magnifying mirror in the bathroom. The room had two closets in the entry way area as well. Kids club/activities. My son enjoyed going to this. The food. Nice health club. Lovely spa. We also rented a cabana ($300 for the day or $150 for a half day--AFTER 4 p.m.). The cabana came with two bottles of three different types of sodas (your choice), several bottles of water, Evian mist, a pitcher of virgin Mojitos, a HUGE fresh fruit platter and sunscreen packets. Yes, $300 is high, but we felt like it was worth it, as we were there from 10-5. There is a TV in the cabana as well. We had lunch delivered to our cabana from Aquamarine which was very good. Negatives: Mandatory valet parking. I thought this was ridiculous since there was a garage closeby. Plus, you are in and out so much going to Disney. That can get a little pricey, but you are staying at The Waldorf. The \"young\" staff around the pool. They weren't very attentive until I talked to the man in charge of the pool area. Things changed after that. Otherwise, the staff was great! I definitely will be returning. We have stayed at many hotels in Orlando while visiting Disney. This one is luxury at its finest! We also love The Hilton Bonnet Creek next door. We had a great rate. In fact, we have paid much more to stay in several of the deluxe Disney resorts with rooms not nearly as nice for twice the money!! We paid $278 a night for our room on Expedia with a Florida resident rate.

Amazing new hotel, very clean, very modern, perfect interior everywhere (public spaces, restaurants, rooms), just can't praise it enough. We were staying in a suite with a balcony, nice pool views, fireworks in Magic Kingdom every night from 10pm sharp, don't miss it! I had the best bathrobe in my life, even bought one for myself from the hotel shop, around $86, can't wait to start using it. Opulent bedroom, gorgeous bathroom with everything you might need, great toiletries from Salvatore Ferragamo, amazing smell.Lots of towels in all sizes. Just a couple of concerns: 1. We hired a car with Garmin GPS at Miami and travelled all the way to Orlando. The adress the hotel provided us with (Bonnet Creek Resort Lane) was not on our GPS, neither was Waldorf Astoria hotel itself. I knew from Tripadvisor that Waldorf was overlooking Hilton so we started driving around Hiltons (there are 2 or 3 in the area), but it was all wrong. It took us 40 more minutes to realise there is no such thing as Bonnet Creek Resort, what it used to be has been completely redevelopped and new Hilton and Waldorf Astoria hotels added. If you have the same problem with your GPS look for Bonnet Creek Resort. 2. Dining: we travelled with a 9 y.o., so I must admit there aren't many dining options for that age group. In Waldorf, you can eat in the lobby if you like, but in Easter it was overcrowded. There is Bull&Bear Grill, which does not cater for kids and the prices are just ridiculous, $48 for a steak with no sides, + 18-20% compulsory tips -by far too much, so we ate there just once. We found a perfect place in Hilton (the hotels are connected on the lobby level, you don't have to go outside, and you can buy/dine in Hilton using the Astoria hotel card, really handy). The Italian restaurant La Luce in Hilton is amazing, reasonably priced and the dishes are very, very tasty. We had pizzas, pastas, risotto, fired seafood, etc. - sensational. There is another place in Hilton for people with kids, Harvest restaurant, but it looks more like Butlins, we didn't try it. On the last night we went to Wyndham hotel for dinner, good value for money but not as good as La Luce. And also you have to pay straight after dinner! 3. Last thing - Such a shame we did not have enough time to relish the hotel enough as we were SO busy in Disney every day! Pay more and book one more day just to stay in and RELAX, it's well worth it.

The hotel was running an excellent offer of a $100 resort credit per night and although the price for our suite was costly I felt that the offer would help defray the cost of our food. I spoke to a very kind woman with whom I made our reservation and explained the purpose of our visit. She spoke with me for quite some time and seemed genuinely interested in making our stay memorable. Upon arrival we were greeted appropriately and there were gentlemen present to hold the doors open as well as bellmen to take our luggage. The front staff was welcoming but did appear a bit unexperienced. The lobby was absolutely beautiful and seemed very warm and friendly opposed to the initial feel of the Grande Lakes Ritz which we have previously stayed. Our room was a gorgeous Deluxe Suite with a very nice balcony that over looked the pool. Although I did request a high floor and did not get it, even though I am a Hilton Honors member, I was very pleased with our room assignment. Upon entering our suite there were two cupcakes with several toppings to choose from and a happy birthday note for my daughter. Needless to say that was a very nice touch. Now, at this point I must say that the bellman did stay a little too long \"showing\" me the room. I never felt uncomfortable but I did feel as though he was going the extra mile for a bigger tip perhaps. The weather was not very nice the weekend we stayed but we did dine at the outdoor pool area. The food was great and our server was attentive however I had to interrupt the very talkative bar tender to politely request that he send someone to take our order. Our first night was fabulous and the next morning we ate breakfast at Oscar's. Once again, noone was available to seat us and I had to find the hostess. I did find the service to be subpar but my daughter enjoyed the food and we were fortunate to have the amazing chocolate croissants. Our visit continued with a stop at the adjoining Hilton's lazy river pool which is a must see. Unfortunately our second night's stay was interrupted by loud neighboring guests. I did call the front desk and ask that the issue be addressed as I was suffering from a severe migraine. Now for me this is where the Waldorf does not stack up against the Ritz in customer service. Although I was told a security guard would be sent up I was never asked if I needed anything such as a pain reliever or perhaps chamomile tea. As a parent traveling with a lone teen and with it being quite late I think it should have been basic common courtesy to see if I needed anything. That may sound a little over the top for some but I can tell you that the details are what create and sustain luxury hotels. The next morning I requested late check out but was also denied inspite of the prior evening's events. After my visit I received an e-mail survey from the Waldorf and was contacted by the evening manager who did credit my bill a small portion to make up for the poor service. This is a beautiful hotel with so much potential. I really hope they hire some experienced hospitality workers so they can improve their customer service. The absolute best part of our stay was a special dinner at Bull and Bear which I will be reviewing separately in the restaurant section. I would also like to add that there was an age limit for use of the spa at the time of our visit so my daughter and I could not even get a mani/pedi together. I was very surprised since many of the local spas offer a \"Mommy and Me\" package let alone allowing teens who are accompanied by an adult.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal Canada", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Hotel\u201d", "Author": "AndreMontrealCanada", "ReviewID": "UR127626314", "Content": "My wife and I are just returning from a 5 nights trip in Orlando at the Waldorf Hotel.

There isn't much I can add to the gushing reviews before me. They truly deserve their Travellers' Choice 2012 Winner award for Luxury! Beds were so comfortable it was difficult getting out everyday. Turn-down service was lovely with them setting a relaxing atmosphere by laying out the robes, chocolates and even setting the TV to play jazz music. Nice touch! Hotels find it very hard to design a shower that doesn't leak, but the WA has mastered this. Finally! No pools in the bathroom! The bathroom was massive. The tub was relatively small, but I personally don't use tubs anyway. The free Nespresso machines were a very nice touch. My only gripes/comments are: 1. Breakfast at Oscars - they made us wait even though the restaurant was half empty! Not sure what was going on there. There was a crowd waiting when they appeared like they could sit us all anyway. The wait wasn't very long, but it was odd with the number of empty tables they had. The buffet breakfast was great with lots of choice (unlimited coffee and orange juice, omelette and waffle station, pastries galore, cold cuts, fruit and standard breakfast fare - sausages, eggs, etc) at $28 per person without tip. 2. We needed to extend our stay by one night but they couldn't accommodate us as they were fully booked. I just felt that they dropped the ball on their top-notch service during the stay by being unaccommodating. The lady at the front desk wasn't very helpful or friendly and I was surprised she didn't offer to check with the Hilton next door for us, even though that would be the next logical step given that they share facilities and it's right next door! I had to ask her whether she could help check with the Hilton and we managed to get a room there. Comparing the Hilton Bonnet Creek to WA Orlando, the Hilton is A LOT more kid orientated. The Hilton has many small kids running around, so it'll be better staying at the WA if you'd prefer somewhere less chaotic (in a small children way). 3. The shuttle bus to Disney Land fills up pretty quickly as it stops at the Hilton first before it reaches the WA. For the 3 days we used the service, either from the hotel, or returning from the park, they usually had to call for a second bus. 3. The biggest gripe I had was the differential in pricing for services between the Hilton Bonnet Creek (literally next door, around 200m away) and the WA Orlando. A town car (i.e. taxi) to the airport from WA would cost $75 flat rate (quoted to me by the driver), whereas from the Hilton BC was $67. Excuse me?! I understand that the WA is more of a luxury hotel than the Hilton, but this is blatant price fixing!!!! Also, at the WA, the buffet breakfast was $28, whereas in the Hilton, it is $19 for 90% of the same food, and children under a certain age (can't remember how old) could eat for free. WHAT!? At least you can walk over from WA to use Hilton's amenities but I felt a bit cheated. Saying all that, I would return.

The bus played a constant rotation of Disney movies which kept my little one entertained however with all the stops it took at least 45 minutes to get back to the hotel after a long day at the parks.

Since they made my first stay there very enjoyable. My girlfriends and i planned a reunion/birthday trip. We called the hotel prior to our arrival to inform them of the special occasion. After an exhausting red-eye flight, I was expecting the gracious and warm welcome that I became rather used to during my first stay at the Waldorf. I was not impressed by the young man working at concierge. I felt he was very dismissive; I got the sense he assumed we were young and naive. Although my friends and I may look young, we're all professional adults; which is why I can't comprehend why we were treated so poorly. I informed the young man at the concierge again about the momentous occasion, and that it was my friend's birthday. I asked if there was anything they could do in order to make it special. He told me they charged for champagne and chocolate covered strawberries but would send them up. The last time I was there, it was my wedding anniversary and we were never charged for the champagne or chocolate covered strawberries. In fact, we were also given a complimentary suite. When I informed him of this, he said he could do nothing about it. I called my husband, who then called the reservations department. They set up the complimentary strawberries, and the young man seemed surprised. I also asked about any upgrades; because truly, nothing beats a Waldorf suite for me. He kept insisting they had no free upgrades available. I stopped him and said as a preferred Hilton Honors member, I wouldn't mind paying for the upgrade. I was informed there were no upgrades available even if I paid, and I was just about done checking in. The entire time while I was trying to speak to him, he kept answering phone calls and interrupting me to say hello to other guests. I felt quite the disappointment and my sudden change of mood became very clear. To make up for it, he offered vouchers for each of us to get a free beverage at the bar, but after the way we were treated, none of us wanted anything from him. He also tried to cut us a deal, saying he wasn't supposed to do this but he could offer us a small percentage off the spa services if we bought any spa packages, but we turned him down. The rest of our time was amazing there. The room service and the door men were divine and just plain sweet. The pool is heavenly and the shuttle to Disney is the biggest plus. We also ate at the Bull & Bear and were treated incredibly well by the manager and the waiters. Nothing beats the Bull & Bear steak, and their dessert is to die for. I wish I could just focus more on the positive like I did for my first review at the Waldorf (subject: My favorite!) because it was fantastic. However, the way we were treated when we first arrived did leave me feeling rather unimportant.

A. THE LOCATION: It is as close to Magic Kingdom as some of the Disney Resorts such as Coronado Springs, All-Star Sports Resorts...The frequent shuttle service provided to Hilton Bonnet Creek and Waldorf Astoria (WA) makes it a convenient, quiet, elegant choice to stay when visiting Disney. Moreover, depends on the location of the room (such as those facing the pool and golf course and are closer to the Hilton property), you might be able to see the fireworks from Epcot at night. Shuttle service goes every 30 minutes (with exact schedule time) to and from MK. Epcot is every hour and Animal Kingdom is evey 2 hours (I think). I've never experienced any shuttle service as on time and precised as this. Disney transportation does not go on schedule. It is more like every 20-25 min. Everyone just form a line and wait. B: FIRST IMPRESSION: Having passed through the Grand and massive Wyndham at the entrance of Bonnet Creek, I was heartbroken seeing the WA. The hotel building was smaller, the look wasn't resort-ish; but rather a more modern looking building with some unattractive light blue color outside. Even the entrance of the hotel is not as grand as the Hilton next door. C. THE LOBBY: Big, clean, nice view of the pool but somewhat sterile. Don't expect the Grand lobby look of the WA New York. The multi color neon light behind the check in area was another miss. However, the hotel's goal is trying to achieve a more modern and not traditional look. The marble lobby is very clean. D. THE ROOM: We had the Deluxe Suite (945 sft) room on the 11th floor with the expansive view of the pool/golf course and fireworks at Epcot. The decor is modern and elegant, simple but tasteful. The separate livingroom has blueray DVD player and the most luxurious pull out queen size sofa bed (I think it was memory foam). The breakfast area has a dining table and chairs for 4 with generous cabinets for wetbar and a small/wine refrigerator. The beds in the bedroom, however, weren't the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in (be advised that we prefer our beds a touch firmer, just personal choice and in no way means that these beds are not comfortable). The marble bathroom is very clean with separate tube and shower. The room is very clean and comfortable overall. E. THE FOOD: Breakfast buffet at Oscar was decent with made to order omelet, crepes, pancakes, fruits, scrable eggs, sausages, bacon, french toast, smoke salmon, grits, oatmeal, variety of bread, pastries, juices. Service was excellent at the restaurant. La Luce (at Hilton) was a surprisingly good place for delicious Italian food (best pizza, thumbs up for clams with pasta, pork loin and rotisserie chicken). We didn't dine at Bull and Bear because of young children. However, the Manager Brendon was nice enough to allow us to order their food for room service. The steak was 8/10. Wasn't as juicy and sweet and melted in your mouth as I was hoping for. The fish was bland, fishy and dry (5/10). F. THE SERVICE: The best part about WA. From Georgie, the Assistant Director who was very personable and attentive, to Matt, the food manager, to the housekeepers and their supervisors. Everyone was extremely helpful, attentive. The star of my stay has to go to Michelle (personal concierge), who took all of my groceries that I've ordered thru Garden Grocers(snacks, yogurt, milk....for the kids and water...) and arranged them nicely in the fridge and cabinets before my arrival to the room. That was the best service I've ever experienced. OVERALL: I visited Polynesian, Grand Floridian, Contemporary, Animal Kingdom lodge and villa just to see if I made the right decision and could change it for next time. There was no way on earth I would change my mind. These resorts are older, more crowded, suffocated. I wouldn't want to go back to the same crowd at the park.

They had the room for a nice tub, but NO they put in this nothing tub. The lighting in the bathroom was SO poor, the CEO should try to shave with that lighting! The bed was way to soft and the TV was at an angle from the bed. Amenities were just so-so for a so called top hotel. The worst was the charges for WiFI, what a rip off!

We chose this hotel because we wanted a quieter, less chaotic environment sans Disney sensory overload. We chose right. Let me start with the positive... The hotel is beautiful. In true Waldorf fashion, the staff was impeccably poised and charming. We were upgraded from standard room to a one bedroom king suite which was a nice treat and the room was absolutely beautiful. I can't say enough about the room, it was luxurious and spacious we loved it! The bathroom alone was the size of a standard room! The breakfast buffet at Oscars, lunch at Aquamarine and late night room service was great. Attention to detail and excellent customer service is top notch. And now the not so positive... Our one and only bad experience was upon check-in with GABE the desk clerk who so willingly offered us our room upgrade to a suite on the 11th floor but made us wait (unnecessarily) for 2 1/2 hours for the room. Without too much whining on my part, he lied about the room being ready in an hour, he continued to lie for 2 1/2 hours, then after all that wait, he finally advised us that the room would be done in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later no Gabe and no room so we asked went to the front desk to ask Gabe and, what a surprise, Gabe had left for the day. The uber snobby night clerk who was now \"helping\" us had no idea that we've been waiting for a room. The nasty, brainless twit had no clue what we were talking about (\"what suite on the 11th floor? Oh that's not ready, you can't have it\" she snipped). After explaining all that had happene d and a phone call to Gabe, she begrudgingly offered us another suite on the 7th floor and ever so nicely (sarcasm here again) said, \"take this one instead, it's not a big deal\". Well, yes it was a big deal for us since we had to sit in the lounge (did I mention for 2 1/2 hours?) with 2 anxious little girls who were dying to go to Disneyworld and we were being told over and over again by Gabe that our room was almost ready and it was a complete lie. Ok, rant over but on a good note. We did talk to the very nice concierge the next day and mentioned what happened and without hesitation he apologized and comped us our first night's stay. Tip: The buses to and from the Disney resorts are well run and easy to use. The downside is, it can take up to 40 minutes to get to some of the Disney parks because of the bus stops in between so we chose to take a taxi to go into the Disney parks each day and took the Waldorf/Hilton bus back to the hotel each night. The bus ride back to the hotel only takes about 20 minutes. Overall: Our stay at the Waldorf was exceptional and restful. It was well worth the initial headache. We would highly recommend it.

The good: Breakfast buffet at Oscars definitely met our expectations. Service was ALWAYS friendly with some staff seeming to know what they were doing and others needing a bit of direction. Food was great! Pool service was nice and pool area, in keeping with the hotel, is sprawling. This was fun for our children. Door/valet staff very polite and punctual each time we requested our car. The not-so-good: Hallways were messy with leftover glasses and room service that never seemed to be cleared. Also, the night we had dinner at the hotel (we ate at the bar because we did not want fine dining at Bull and Bear and there were no other options) the food was horrible. I read prior to booking that this was not a very kid-friendly hotel. To a certain extent I think this is true, however we saw more children during our stay than we expected. Perhaps this is due to the time of year. Either way, we felt our children were mostly well-received. The lazy river and slide at the Hilton next door were always there if we wanted a louder atmosphere!

It did but there were kinks in this Orlando armour. Firstly the pluses - we stayed in the premier room which was big and airy, with two large beds and an excellent view of the golf course. For the price we paid, there was a buffet breakfast thrown in at Oscars which was lavish to say the least as well as a $50 credit per night which can be used at any of its outlets. The staff at Oscars were extremely helpful and attentive - two worthy of mention were Carrie and Clay. There were also helpful reception staff and the concierge was equally noteworthy. They gave the name to a fantastic Japanese restaurant called Dragonfly which was superb! However, housekeeping failed to live up to expectations not replenishing soap or Q-tips when they were used. And there was the cause of a leaky shower stall that flooded the bathroom every time we bathed! The hotel only managed to solve the problem after we explained to them that the gap between the shower door and the wall meant water seeping out and making huge puddles. It didn't help that housekeeping never supplied us fresh floor towels after we mopped up the water. This was only rectified after I complained! Also, the hotel had placed the safe in the room on floor level so if you were not able to squat, you would have to sit on the carpet to open the safe every time you wanted to use it. That I found quite weird! But the good things were still plenty including the excellent Bull and Bear restaurant in the hotel. My husband and I had dinner there twice because the food was just so good. The 10-ounce burger gets top marks ... the best I have ever tasted and I have tasted many burgers in my lifetime. And the appetisers were a great fusion of colours and taste - try the truffle-flavoured devilled eggs or the escargots and gnocchi. They were an unusual blend but very good. Even the corn soup (not my husband's favourite choice) got a thumbs-up from him. For those who want to visit Disney theme parks, the Waldorf has a bus service to all the 4 parks on a fairly regular basis, or you could hop on a cab which would cost around $9 - $12 depending on which location. Because the hotel is linked to the Hilton, there are a lot more F&B outlets to choose from and one could get the hotel to use a golf cart to send you over to the Hilton if you were too lazy to walk the distance.

There's a shuttle to the Disney parks. Downtown Disney has free parking and it was a 5 minute drive (almost nothing) from the hotel. We took the girls to Cirque du Soleil for a 6pm show and then had room service for dinner at 8pm while we watched a movie. I would highly recommend this hotel. If you need to bring the kids to Disney, but still want a civilized experience - stay at the Waldorf.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hartford, New York", "Title": "\u201cWent out of their way to be superb!\u201d", "Author": "lillious", "ReviewID": "UR124706646", "Content": "I had originally booked the Hilton next door but thought I had booked the Waldorf.

Great service - we got extra blankets and toothbrushes quickly. The customer service always picked up on the first ring. The buffet breakfast at Oscar's was to die-for! Truly the best breakfast I've had anywhere. It seemed to have good conference facilities and it was convenient for me because my conference was there. Downsides - Tripadvisor reviews suggested in getting a high room with a view of DIsney to watch the night fireworks. So when I made the reservation, I made this room request. This was 3 months in advance, and then I called a month in advance to confirm the room request, and then called a day before arrival to confirm. At checkin at 3pm - they said they sorry but they did NOT have my requested rooms available! We got a low room, inside corner rooms with no view. Second downside - unreliable Hertz car rental office. The hotel is connected to the Hilton (Waldorf Astoria is part of Hilton) and we reserved a rental car to go to the Kennedy Space Station. We went to pick up the car in the morning and..no car. They said for us to wait and they would get the car from the other location. 2 hours later of waiting in the lobby? No car. The Hertz office simply did not know where the car was. We missed our lunch with the astronauts as a result. The hotel concierge was not helpful and could not find alternative transportation, other than telling me that I could book a car service for $170 each way. Thirdly - this hotel is not convenient for those wanting to go to Disney because it is not one of the Disney properties and you can't get to the DisneyWord/Epcot directly. You have to take the shuttle to the central parking place, and then take a Disney monorail/boat. In our case, we kept missing the shuttle, so had to take a cab to the parking place, and then wait for the Disney monorail/boat. We had gone to DisneyWorld in the morning and wanted to go home in the afternoon and play in the pool with the plan of going back to Disney for the fireworks, but it took so long to get back to the hotel - wait for the boat/monorail, wait for the shuttle - that we didn't end up going back to Disney later.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milford, New York", "Title": "\u201cAdult Luxury Next Door to Disney\u201d", "Author": "kelting", "ReviewID": "UR124683280", "Content": "My sister and I spent two nights at the Waldorf/Orlando enjoying grown-up activities while our brother and his family visited Disneyworld.

Location This is as close as you can get Disney without staying with Disney. It's close to all the Disney attractions including Downtown Disney. It is also easily accessible from I-4 exit 67. Price Rooms typically run $149-250 which is a real deal for an upscale hotel. Food There are two main restaurants in the hotel. The Bull & Bear is a super expensive steak house. Oscars is the hotel cafe where breakfast is $28. If you want more variety stay at the Hilton next door. Room tip -- if you stay on the side of the building over the Bull & Bear (even on a high floor) expect to smell charred steak during your stay. Room Rooms are large and well equipped in modern elegance. They have all the usual electronic amenities and Ferragamo toiletries. Pool/Spa High end luxurious spa. There are two pools. One of them is designed for kids but I've never seen any there. The pools are quiet -- perfect if you want to just relax and read a book. If you're looking for family fun or a festive atmosphere, you can take the long walk (or ride) to the Hilton pool which includes a lazy river. Lobby Gorgeous. A modern interpretation of the classic. Upscale yet accessible and artistic. The lobby bar is large with music. In February they have a gourmet chocolate bar. Valet Super fast and friendly. Very professional. They keep cars moving and you feel like a VIP. Service Overall excellent. Housekeeping was discreet, polite and thorough. Check in was fast and friendly. Check out was a horrible chaotic mess. There were about 50 people waiting for four check out counters. All the while there were hotel staff standing in the lobby with nothing to do.

The mandotory charge but a little steep for the service received. Apart from the valet the staff were very efficient and accomadating. Only downside is the food and beverage options are very expensive. Even more expensive than the Boca Raton Resort (also a Waldorf). The cost for breakfast was included for 2 in our rate but it was still $25 for my 7 year old to have the buffet.If we had not booked a rate including breakfast we would not have paid the $35 per adult plus tax and tip.

From dropping off the car curbside to having our reservations being exactly as asked (including the wonderful extras from American Express) to being escorted to the elevators after a tour of the lobby, our impression within the first 15 minutes was that we had found that great place where luxury meets comfort in a hotel. Our room was beautiful, with a view of the Disney Parks fireworks and also the fireworks provided by the hotel for the holiday weekend. The bed was comfortable, the room was spacious, and the bathroom was well-stocked with fluffy towels and robes.

The pool staff were incredibly attentive and accommodating. We enjoyed the touch of live music with the talented acoustic guitar player. In the late afternoon each day, tables were set up on the pool deck with hot cocoa, smores, hot wassail, whipping cream, peppermint sticks. It was a fabulous sweet treat!

It was loud with lots of kids. There appeared to be a soccer conference underway so there were young families everywhere. We really appreciated the elegance and solitude that the WA exuded the moment we crossed onto its premises. We dined at Oscars for a dinner and breakfast buffet with our children. Again, the service was excellent with special attention paid to the kids. We also dined at Bull and Bear and La Luce (Hilton) sans children. Both meals were exceptional, especially the Bull and Bear.

Absolutely. Except For One Itsy Bitsy Thing....\u201d", "Author": "BluntedHedgehog", "ReviewID": "UR122298877", "Content": "Let's be honest. As a serial monogamist Disney-ite (someone who plans their jailbreaks as often as possible but recognizes no theme park but The Mouse), I splurge for my 2-4 night holidays here. I've given up on the Disney-owned or sponsored properties after too many Deluxe resorts surprised me with rude/unhelpful staff and shabby housekeeping. But as one of the submerged 99%, going to the Waldorf Astoria felt awkward. Trolling through AAA rates and specials, having available dates so flexible my calendar started looking like a politician's morals, well, it took a bit of persistence and luck to find a price on the HHonors site that the Spouse wouldn't cite as evidence of Irreconcilable Differences. If you're used to trudging up to the Front Desk, exchanging pleasantries and plastic and then nipping off to your room in solitude, the Welcoming Committee at the WA is twelve steps above following the bellman and a Hohner Trumpet Call harmonica below having your own brass band. I was the proud rearguard for Chelsee, my Personal Concierge; Chelsee's personable but awe-inspiring understudy and my Weekend Life Coach/Bellman Steve (or Charlie). This was my escort to my suite-upgrade. I'm only kidding about Steve/Charlie being a Life Coach but he did seem to know more about everything than I did, including which of the four closets in the room held the slippers and how he could smuggle prime rib from the restaurant to my room since it wasn't on the room service menu. I was nearly sorry to see everyone leave since I forgot to ask which of the four remotes in the living area operated what. And Chelsee never made it back with the schedule of theme park shuttle times. But the room, ah, the room. A Sub Zero mini fridge to hold the contents of an oenophile's most ambitious dream, mirrored wet bar, glass dining table, marble floors (and heated, I think, in the bathroom), room to walk anywhere without fear of careening into furniture, glass door to the balcony with a sublime view of Downtown Disney and the Cirque du Soleil building, nearly full-sized Ferragamo toiletries and a separate glass walled shower large enough to wish I hadn't made the trip alone. The bathrobes were a bit disappointing; two part textile thingies that were comfortable enough but didn't really sing with barely restrained decadence. And sadly, nothing I wanted to purchase as a souvenir. Interesting touches such as a brass pull handle on the back of the bedroom desk chair. All the better to avoid soiling and wearing the damask upholstery. And mirabile dictu!-the chair height was ergonomically perfect for computer work! That alone was worth the price of admission. The bed was a lullaby confection of pillows and bolsters and duvet and woven coverlet and there was so much that I gratefully admitted defeat and stood aside while the evening turn-down magician made sense of it all. The towels were beyond compare for softness and size. I've seen bath sheets before but I tied three of these together and was able to comfortably lower myself from the 12th floor to the porte cochere. Part of that statement may contain flexible standards of veracity. So what was the Itsy Bitsy Problem? Well, that's kind of a multi-episode situation. One which would make Basil feel right at home. No, it wasn't a filigreed Siberian hamster in the biscuit box. But of three room service visits, all had glitches ranging from annoying (someone else's jam on the breakfast salt shaker) to the frustrating (requesting the filet mignon to be 'juicy, pink, not shoe leather but not pulsating' and getting a grey dry something that still managed to have terrific flavor) and a midnight snack that lead to an excess of alimentary entertainment. The situation was finally dealt with effectively and without the polite wide-eyed skepticism learnt from steely Risk Management personnel but it wasn't pleasant to run the gauntlet of staff to get to an upper managerial level better able to respond. Let me be very clear: I understand that they've Seen It All and guest service runs a tight race beside loyalty to the corporation. And as a former police officer from one of the more swank areas of South Florida, I know some of the scams hotels have to deal with. They have my sympathy but this one should have been handled without the guest having to plod up the corporate ladder getting callouses from the sandpaper of disbelieving looks. (Ow. Talk about a tortured sentence. Apologies. Caused by reliving the experience.) Will I be going back to the Waldorf Astoria Orlando? In a New York minute. Even if I have to pay rack rate. Will I order room service? Oh, yeah. Oscar's Angel Food Cake was the caloric equivalent of the fireworks over Cinderella's Castle. They both look incredible and you know you can't duplicate the experience anywhere else. And that goes for the entire Waldorf Astoria Experience. Stay tuned for the next visit! **Note to Parents Staying with Children Between the Ages of 5-15: Offer to give the little darlings $1 for every time they hear a staffer use the word 'absolutely'. You have to let them listen in on phone calls, too. Keep at least $25 per child, per day for payment and make sure they don't get the giggles when they're keeping track of the Luxury Language. Oh, and pay no attention to the spoiled families grousing that it takes 20 minutes for the WA bus to take them from EPCOT back to the hotel. Complaining because drinks aren't served and they don't have programmable entertainment in the seatbacks.

We came to the hotel to enjoy the holiday season with family living in the Orlando area. The Disney attractions were not on our radar. What we came to do was rest, relax, read, sleep, eat and entertain family. We all had nothing but praise and will undoubtably return as our plans allow. Our welcome at car arrival was genuine, while our welcome at reception was also filled with warmth. Our personal concierge promptly escorted us to our room, pointing out hotel features. Our room, a king, two room suite was unreal. There was so much space to stretch out, sleep, watch two tvs, and a kitchen area to allow for food and drink preparation for a small army. Room ammenties were luxcuroius. We so enjoyed the master bed and its high qulaity sheets, pillows and mattress. Our bathroom was promptly filled with the extra towels and soaps we requested. The Nespresso coffee machine was a joy. We have one similar at home and delight in its quality. Our room attendents saw to our every need, every day. I used the gym daily and delighted in its cleanliness and most modern equipment. Our experience at Oscars for morning buffet breakfasts was joyful. The food was amazing and we absolutely delighted in the French style baked goods that were both delicious and beautiful to look at. What was especially nice for all hotel guests was the free morning coffee/tea bar in the glorious lobby each morning. Service started at around 6 am and carried on until past 9 am,which was a real plus for all hotel guests. We have been in many 4 & 5 star hotels where this type coffee service is not as abundant. We definitely would return to the wonderful Waldorf property. A return dining experience to the Bull & Bear restaurant would rank as number 1 on our to-do list along with a return to the glorious Gurlain spa. Both are simply that amazing. We look forward to our return to this wonderful property and thank the WA staff for making our holiday weekend so memorable. Thank you.

At any given time there is a high ratio of staff to guests walking through the hotel lobby. The hotel is on Disney property at Bonnet Creek, but the property doesn't provide all the same benefits as a hotel on sight property like the Grand Floridian or Contemporary. We stayed at this property as a family visiting Disney Theme Parks. The WA functioned well in this capacity, but I see this property as better suited for corporate meetings and functions. For instance, when we checked in I needed to buy Disney tickets and I was informed that we had to make our way over to the adjacent Hilton in order to buy tickets. Considering that this is a WA property I would expect that Disney tickets and conveniences would be on property for guests. The lobby of the WA fills the guest with senses of blues and whites. According to employees the center piece clock is a replica of the clock at WA in NYC. The only difference is that the NYC clock is gold and this is silver. From my standpoint, the big difference is that the WA NYC clock is filled with tradition in a beautiful traditional lobby while this clock is new and in an unimpressive lobby that is neither quaint, warm or impressive. My daughter (15 years old) observed that the property didn't feel like a \"special Disney\" hotel and that it felt more like it belonged in Los Angeles or any other American urban setting. The suite we stayed in was large almost to the point of feeling cavernous. Now, traveling with children large works out well and is functional. The bathroom was huge with both a shower and tub. In November we stayed at the WA in NY and those rooms are older, but more quaint and comfortable with the fire place and tradition that doesn't get built over night in a new structure. The coffee maker was an issue for our family in that it was loud considering we wake up earlier than our children and crave that morning cup of coffee. I liked the coffee system, but it didn't please my wife. The bar area on the lobby level felt large and lacked the cozy, comfortable, warm feeling that a property like this should offer. The hotel provides bus service to the parks on a regular basis, but we decided to drive as waiting is not my favorite activity. Yes, I know, this is Disney. Hilton Diamond and Gold members do not receive complimentary breakfast and there is no executive lounge. For me, this is a major drawback and offers me no incentive to stay at this property vs other competitors. From my standpoint I would stay at the JW Marriott or the Ritz over this property because of the feel and overall experiences I've had at that property over numerous visits to Orlando. I would suggest staying at the Grand Floridian, Polynesian, Contemporary and Wilderness Lodge over this property if you are visiting to do the Disney Theme parks. I would consider this property for a business function or weekend getaways if Disney isnt the only reason for your visit.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Wonderful Expereince!\u201d", "Author": "Alison P", "ReviewID": "UR121885114", "Content": "From the moment you pull up and the doorman opens your door to greet you to the time you check out, every second at the Waldorf is special!

Free coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning was nice and convenient. Location within Disney World is great, we took cabs everywhere and had no problem Here are the not so good: housekeeping was pretty bad. we left the robes on the floor one day, because the kids spilled some juice on them and we wanted the maids to take them to be washed. well, the maid NEVER picked it up off the floor. After the first day she left it there, it was a game to me to see if she would ever pick it up, nope never, lol. It was just left in a dirty pile in the bedroom. The showers are starting to have mold/mildew stains in the grout. This is a fairly new hotel, and mold/mildew in the bathrooms should not be a problem yet for sure. The maids need to buddy up to a bottle of clorox and a scrub brush. I could tell they clean around your stuff, instead of picking things up and doing a thorough cleaning. We were there a week, so I expect at least one very thorough cleaning during a week stay. The 'kitchenette' had zero supplies. No dishes, no silverware, only a couple of glasses. there was no microwave. The only thing it had was a bar to sit at to eat room service, a fridge, and a sink. This is not very helpful if you planned on buying supplies to feed the kids in the room. otherwise what is the use of the kitchen? The whole reason I paid for a suite was to eat in the room a few times, to give the kids a break from restaurants, and give us adults a break from making the kids sit still in restaurants. we ended up order a lot of room service which was good, but expensive and it is such a waste to spend that kind of money on dinners for 2 kids under 5 years old. same for breakfast. $30 buffet when my kids are just as happy with a bowl of cereal in the room before Disney is just a waste of money. but with no bowls and no spoons it just didn't work. the gift/sundries shop didn't even carry a small bottle of dish soap so I could wash baby bottles in the 'kitchen' sink! This mattered to us as we were there for a full week The service overall was just ok. Nothing special, nothing terrible. So, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 3, is that I have a feeling there isn't anywhere nicer to stay in Disney World at this price. The Grand Floridian was twice the price, as were a couple other of the 5 star Disney properties, but I read that they are in dire need of updating (one of my pet peeves in a hotel). Would i stay here again? Probably because I just don't see the point of spending double on a trip to Disney.

The front desk staff was always willing to help in any way they could. The first day we got there the pool staff was very attentive to our needs,however the second day the guy who was at the pool was no where to be found, and showed little to no attention to us or anyone else. At the poolside bar the bartender who's name is Ryan was absolutely amazing!! His drinks were great and he was very nice. The only thing we were not happy about at all was our first night stay. We called the front desk and asked about the bars and restaurants in the hotel where we would be able to have a little bite and some drinks. The gentleman who answered right away geared us to go next door to the hilton saying that the bar there stays open till 2am as to where the Waldorf bars/restaurants close 11pm and sooner. So we felt we had no choice and went to the bar in the hilton as he suggested and the service we got was HORRIBLE! We asked the bartender if he had a certain kind of liquor and he said no, we then asked if he had another kind of liquor and he again said no and walked away without even suggesting something else or just to make an effort. After that my husband and I didn't feel welcome there at all so we got up and left. We then went to the italian restaurant at the hilton which was a bit better but i have to say the drinks were bad, we had to ask if there was any liquor in the drinks cause it tasted like pure coke in my husbands rum and coke and mine tasted like sweet lime water instead of a mojito. After we finished there we went back to our hotel and looked at the restaurant there called Bull and Bear and when we went in and asked what time they closed the nice guy at the front told was 11pm but if you are here enjoying yourself we will stay open for you.

I searched for a nice hotel to create a special memory for my wife and me and discovered the W/A. I'm an HHonors member and booked through their site with a note regarding the birthday celebration. We showed up and were greeted with a hearty \"happy birthday\" and an upgrade to a very nice suite. 30 minutes after we got to our room, the wine and a note from the manager arrived wishing is happy birthday and a pleasant stay. The greeting set the tone for a wonderful 5 day stay. We found the hotel staff consistently pleasant and helpful. The room lay-out is very comfortable, the hotel lobby is beautiful, workout center is large and complete. Plenty of restaurant options on property, large pool with attentive attendents. We didn't take advantage of the on-site spa on this trip. Loved - the warmth and effort of the staff, Bull and Bear, immaculate grounds, workout center (water and clean towels at all the aerobic gear), drinks in Peacock Alley, the value (we were there in \"off-season\", but the room rate was LOW given the quality of the experience). Didn't love - the property is pretty close to hwy 4 and for the suites facing that direction, the balcony will be noisy (with the door closed, there is no outside noise at all), we ran into some inconsistent service in Aquamarine - slow bringing correct size spoons, incorrect orders. Very pleasant servers - just not as sharp as what we experienced in other parts of the W/A. Here's the bottom line - for the money, this property is the best hotel experience my wife and I have had. Don't come expecting 4 Seasons or Ritz (you won't be paying near the money you would at those place) - this W/A is not as formal and precise as those icons, but I don't think that's what they're trying to do.

The hotel is in a quiet section of the Disney madness and pulling up to the hotel, I was a bit surprised at how low-key the entrance was. As another poster commented, the facade of the hotel is a bit plain, but the interior lobby space has an amazing ceiling, which appears to be lit stained glass. Check in was pleasant; the staff called me by name and came out from behind the desk to point the way to the elevators. But when I dropped some items off of my suitcase, none of the staff made a move to help me pick them up. But certain members of the staff in later instances were extraordinarily helpful so I'm not sure if it wasn't just a situational issue rather than service being off as a whole. My room faced the entryway so I did not have a view to speak of. The only negative I will mention about being on this side of the hotel is the fact that the valets pressure wash the drive and entrance rather early in the morning (5-6am). If you are a light sleeper like I am, you will be awoken and wonder what that noise is. The room itself is very nice, crown moulding all around, a large flat screen TV, stylish furniture. I had a room with two queens. I only tested one bed but it was very comfortable. I actually preferred having two beds so I could raid the pillows from the other. The only pillow choices are down, which can go flat rather quickly. There is a down mattress cover as well, so for my fellow suffers of down allergies, bring Benedryl. I was unable to find an alternative pillow choice in the room but had I called housekeeping, I probably could have gotten a synthetic. The Benedryl helped me sleep so... The bathroom was enormous, with a large one-sink vanity with granite counter, a separate tub (not a whirlpool, alas), stand up shower and the requisite phone next to the toilet. I did attempt to take a bath but the tub is not really designed for soaking and the water became cold rather quickly. The shower did have a nice showerhead and good pressure. The bedroom area was comfortable but it's not any more luxurious than some of the nicer Hiltons I've stayed at. I did enjoy the turndown service but declined to wear the robe or slippers (the robe had stains - almost like pen markings - on the cuff, which then made me wonder if it was laundered lately). Housekeeping service always seemed to do a top-notch job otherwise. The pool area is nice although the pool at the Hilton is supposed to be nicer. It was too cold for me to go into the pool but those who did seemed to enjoy it. The service out by the pool was fabulous however. I also had a great service experience from Jose the bellman who helped me with some large boxes and the morning valet who dropped me off at the Hilton very early in the morning to catch the Go airport shuttle which apparently will not pick up at the Waldorf. The woman at the front desk when I checked out was also extremely nice. The service was great for the most part and the room was really nice but not over the top. I'm sure for the right room rate, I would return, if only to try some of the on-property restaurants, which I did not get to try on this trip. If you want to be a little removed from the Disney madness but still be on-property (there is a free shuttle that picks up between the two hotels that runs to Disney) and earn Hilton Hhonors points, the Waldorf is a very nice place to stay.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeland, FL", "Title": "\u201cService seems to be slipping....\u201d", "Author": "sunshine618", "ReviewID": "UR120393690", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in May 2011 for a late anniversary trip. We loved everything about this hotel so much, that we couldn't wait to come back. So, with our son's first birthday approaching, we thought it would be a great reason to return to the hotel. Upon arrival, no one from the hotel held the door open for us even though we were toting several bags, a stroller and our son. We were also not greeted by name this time when checking in - not big deals, but not the great first impression we received last time. Although the hotel was aware that we were there celebrating our son's first birthday, they did nothing to recognize it. We weren't expecting a free meal or anything, but maybe a card in the room, a balloon, maybe a stuffed animal in his crib? Nothing. The man checking us in did say to let them know if there was anything they could do to help us celebrate, but should we really have to ask? Oh well. As we checked in during the evening, all we wanted to do was get to the room and order room service dinner, so we can put our son to bed. Anyway, no room service menus to be found. After a girl comes to the door w/ a crib for us (which we already had in the room), we asked her for breakfast and dinner menus. She did not return. After 10-15 minutes, we called in-room dining and asked for menus. They sent the same girl w/ a breakfast menu and a binder w/ local attractions. So, another call to in-room dining and we finally rec'd the dinner menu. After ordering, dinner was served promptly and it was hot and delicious. However, our drink glasses remained outside of the room on the floor for the remainder of our 2-night stay. Maybe no one saw them? Also, there was some kind of stains on the carpet that had been cleaned, but the texture of the carpet was markedly different in those areas and I wasn't too thrilled w/ my son crawling around on them. But - what can you do? The rest of our stay was much better. The service by the pool was great. The pool is heated to 82 degrees, which is cold for native Floridians like us, but others didn't seem to mind it. The zero entry pool was great for our son to sit and play. Dinner at Bull and Bear was fantastic! They really made us feel comfortable to have a small child and even brought out a Happy Birthday dessert w/ a candle. Much appreciated!

The hotel is stunning and the staff are quite simply exceptional. Relaxing at the pool was such an enjoyable experience particularly after a visit to the theme parks, shopping malls or to the various other popular attractions. Minutes away from the theme parks the short drive to and from the hotel along the quiet landscaped road overlooking the golf course is a joy itself. Even better, take advantage of the hotel's complimentary luxury coach service then sit back and enjoy the short journey. The hotel's refreshing ice cold bottles of water are a must for the journey. Tip No.1 no parking fees at the theme parks - normally 14 dollars a visit - when you take the bus. Regular drop-off and pick-up times and always on time. During our stay we dined at Oscars, La-Luce (Hilton) and the Bull & Bear. Top class food and thoroughly enjoyable - the Bull & Bear in particular was extra special. A big thank you to Brendan and the team for an unbelievable meal and world class service . Tip no. 2 visit the B&B early in your stay as you'll want to return...oh, and the lemon sweet (can't remember the exact name) Is a must. The food in Peacock Alley was also very good and a bit less expensive. Ditto the golf club lounge and Aqua Marine by the pool. The room, facilities and views particularly if you overlook the pool area and golf course are simply stunning. Tip no 3 ask for a room on one of the higher floors facing in that direction and enjoy the firework display at night from the theme parks in the distance. Other enjoyable and unforgettable experiences - the unique fragrance , atmosphere and subtle background music when entering the hotel. A drink in the lounge (Peacock Alley) at night while the pianist is playing. Relaxing at the pool when the singer / guitarist is performing (Sunday). The valet parking service ( self parking Facility at the Hilton - a minute's walk or 30 second buggy ride if you prefer - a bit cheaper than the valet parking and good fun). The complimentary ice cold face towels handed out by the pool area staff and frozen fruit - absolutely amazing! The jewel in the crown is undoubtedly the quality of staff. Each and every member is polite, attentive, professional and above all - caring. Unrivalled service. Take a bow the entire management team! In all walks of life there are always individuals who stand out so a special mention and a big Scottish thank you to Brendan (B&B), Ryan (Aqua Marine - loved the hiccup cure advice), Nadia and Shannon at the poolside.

Every encounter I had with hotel staff was positive. It appears they even pay people with contagious smiles to stand in the in the lobby to make sure you are smiling. Everyone is very eager to help you and the local restaurant recommendations were always spot on and I was well taken care of at the different places because Waldorf made the reservations for me (at least that is what I was told by the hostesses). I didn't use the pool or spa, but they were only okay looking when compared to the sister property next door. I believe these are shared access properties and I highly recommend the Hilton pool area over the Waldorf. There is 3 star and 5 star difference between the two pool areas. Hilton has a lazy river, organic rock carve shapes and lots of palm trees scattered around this area to give it a more natural setting, where Waldorf is very basic concrete rectangle and flat pool deck. The rooms are extremely clean and kept that way during your stay. My bed was very comfortable. I believe they service the room 2 or 3 times a day. While I was away at dinner they would come in and clean up and put jazz on the radio a robe and slippers next to the bed with some chocolates. A very nice touch. I had several articles of clothing dry cleaned while I was there and everything was done perfectly. The pricing was even reasonable. It was delivered to me at 5pm sharpish as promised. I did not eat at the main restaurant; however, I did eat at the bar one night and the food was very good. They have a great cigar selection there as well and drinks are well executed. I used room service for breakfast and dinner and it was delivered on time as promised and was well prepared. Location to other restaurants and shopping isn't the best because you are on the edge of Disney property, but within about 7 miles you can hit restaurant row and quite a few shopping areas. Nothing within walking distance though. My only two complaints: 1. Expect to go next door to the Hilton if you want an early morning espresso. 2. The shoe shine service was very poor.

We arrived after a long flight from the UK, picked up our car and drove straight to the Waldorf. I am a Hilton honors gold member and had used points for the stay. I was expecting a stuffy hotel with expensive food and drinks and nice but small rooms. When we pulled up to the hotel I was surprised as the porte corchere doesnt look like any other hotel I've visited. The main doors are frosted so you can't see through and it's really quite simple. Bell hops took the luggage and valet parked the car as we had no immediate plans to use it. We were offered cold water and towels and checked in with no fuss and straight up to the room. At this point I must say how great the bell hops and valets are. I seem to remember one called Steve who always remembered us and always had a smile and a chat. When we arrived at the room we were told we had been upgraded to a suite and wow what a great upgrade. We had two rooms with two bathrooms and a lounge with wet bar/kitchen area. The rooms were large, flatscreen TV's, very comfortable bedding and balconies. It was all great. We ate at the pool bar that night. The menu was upscale and the price reflected this. Good quality food in a nice setting. We used the bar every night but didn't eat in the other restaurants. Pool service was good too. My husband and son played 2 rounds of golf and said they were the best rounds of the holiday - better than the Disney courses with better service. My daughter was going to use the Guerlain Spa but they were fully booked so if you want to take advantage then pre book.

From the moment we arrived the hotel staff made us feel like welcome guests in their amazing home - and what a home! The hotel is impeccable clean, bright and airy, with suprisingly serene views of the Disney properties in the distance. Everyone seems to genuinely appreciate that you have come to visit and strives to take care of anything you need. It was my wife's birthday and I had only left a simple note in the online reservation (which I had forgotten about), and when we arrived we were greeted with a spectacular room upgrade to a suite with a balcony overlooking the property and Disney Lands beyond. After we unpacked and enjoyed the balcony view with a glass of wine, there was a knock at the door with a complementary bottle of spakling Domaine Chandon and some chocolate covered strawberries. the Suite itself was large and luxuriously appointed with a ful wet bar and dining area, comfortable living room area with an awesome HDTV and sound system. The seperate bed room and spacious bathroom gave us plenty of room to get ready for the evening together. We were unable to get reservation for the hotel's Bull & Bear restaurant, but the concierge was able to suggest the bar area which had a perfectly romantic small table available. Our server delightfully took great care of us with an excellent wine selection, nice conversation, and a special dessert offer. The meal was all excellent and perfectly prepared, with a creative take on Steak Frites. The next day we both enjoyed the Guerlin Spa, which rivals the service and quality of the local Ritz Carlton Spa. The facilites and talent of the massuesse are absolutely on par with any of the best in town. As a very frequent business traveller, I am ordinarily underwhelmed by the service and attention given by most high-end hotels. So it was really a very special effort, across all areas of this Waldorf Astoria, that impressed me enough to reccommend this Hotel to anyone looking for very special treatment and a genuine, feel-good, relaxing escape from the ordinary hotel experience. This is a luxury hotel that felt balanced and not stuffy; adult but not boring. I will definiately be back and am recommending it to all my local friends who like to take advantage of what the Disney Scene has to offer from time to time.

I was very excited to try out the new Waldorf. The hotel is pretty much on Disney property, this gives them a leg up from the Ritz Carlton which is a ways out closer to the airport. They are going with the Ritz/JW concept of having 2 affiliated hotels side by side with the Hilton being right next door that you can take advantage of. From the exterior, the design of both hotels is not the impressive. The entrance, etc. Once we pulled up and went inside the lobby of Waldorf, I was VERY impressed with the styling. They did an excellent job with interior design. Sort of Chic modern with a glamorous 1930s era edge. Valet only, get ready to pay $20. This is typical for these type of hotels. If you are really cheap, there is nothing stopping you from parking at the Hilton garage and dragging your bags over\u2026.not worth it to me since we were comped for it, but I can understand. If you have visitors or others coming over, grab a drink at the bull and bear and get your $20 valet validated, that is the only restaurant that does it at the hotel. The staff was helpful enough. We were upgraded to suite with our amex platinum and was also very impressed with our room. Again, the interior styling of this hotel is quite stunning. We decided to use the gym before popping over the epcot for food and wine fest. The gym is very nice with plenty of equipment and bottled water. This is a good place to stock up on free bottled water if you need some. We even jogged on the outside jogging trails, but they were way too short and sort of took you through the front parking lot at one point\u2026.not great. The hotel offers transportation to the parks but it is on a specific schedule and is not affiliated with the Disney transportation. This is a downside to staying here. The Disney transportation is much more prompt and much more connected to different locations including other hotels. If you want to go anywhere other than a Disney park, you have to drive or take a taxi\u2026or their black cars that are their version of taxis that charge you triple what a yellow cab does. Again, not great. We ended up going to the pool at the end of the afternoon, it is bit small but very nice with a zero entry. We ate breakfast at Oscars, which had a nice buffet. We had a free credit to try out the spa, very underwhelming facilities\u2026.not worth it. Go to the ritz in Orlando if you want a real spa experience. We had apps and drinks at the Bull and bear steakhouse. This is a beautiful restaurant with pretty good food. The views at sunset were very pretty. In regards to the staff at the hotel, they were nice but they didn\u2019t blow me away. This isn\u2019t Ritz or Four Seasons staff, but this could be a management or leadership issue. I feel like this hotel does not know what it is trying to be. If you stay on a Disney property or the ritz, they go out of their way to make the kids feel special. I felt like the staff didn\u2019t know what to do with the kids at the waldorf. Overall, one of the nicer hotels in Orlando with some of the best interior design and finish, but the Ritz Carlton still wins out with overall facilities and both Disney and the Ritz win out with their amazing staff.

For the price of a business-class room in any big city, we stayed in the best hotel in Orlando. And when we checked out, we'd spent significantly less than we expected (and way less than at any Disney resort). The property is new and immaculate. The room is immediately recognizable as an upgrade to the Hilton standard. Again, no ornate pretense, just luxury and style, with features well outlined in the hotel's description. Unfortunately, the sofa bed seat canted so far forward that we kept having to brace ourselves from rolling off (honestly). Half of the rooms have a view of all 4 Disney parks and their fireworks, across Bonnet Creek and the Waldorf's beautiful golf course; most other rooms can see the D'town Disney Saturday fireworks, the remainder have a golf view. The spa is spacious, beautiful and amenity-blessed. We were blown away by the gracious pool deck and it's pools. Although we ate every meal at the hotel for 6 days, we never sat in a restaurant, so can only comment on the In-Room and poolside food: yum. Everything was fresh, delicious and well-portioned. With all of the other excellent dining options at hand, our best value and first choice was to eat at the Waldorf. Of course, the Waldorf provides every service imaginable. They invented room service and it's surprisingly affordable: choice of sandwich, fries and a soda are the b-traveller standard $20. Spa services cannot be matched. Next time we plan to spend some time with the golf pro. The staff aren't newbies, and the depth of their experience across Orlando hospitality shines. Outstanding and unpretentious applied to every staff interaction, period (I think it's the confidence of competence). If you need fawning, you only need ask. It is the hallmark of the WA brand. My only issue was my language barrier with the housekeepers. **IMPORTANT: it may be crass to discuss, but these people work hard for minimum tip-earner wages and are taxed at 18% of their sales by the IRS, whether you tip or not. If there isn't an automatic gratuity, we give a 20% tip on all sales. We also put a (tax-free) bill or two in everybody's hand, and more for personal services. Even when we feel outrageously generous, it's still very small in the costs of visiting Disney. On the other hand, the staff understands $1 means more to you than $5 to a millionaire, so don't feel compelled to overtip.** The pool culture was the best surprise of the Waldorf Astoria Orlando. It reminded me of the legendary Hollywood pool decks: cabanas, cabana kids and all. The adjacent Hilton has a splashier pool and lazy river for the kids, so families at the Waldorf pools seemed to be spending time together. We ended up spending three-of-five days in a cabana, instead of going to the parks! My one suggestion is to play something more approachable than that ominous lounge-jazz music (maybe primetime TV's favorite format: adult alternative?). Best of all at the Waldorf Astoria Orlando was the rockin' pool staff. While they sensed we wanted informal interactions, I saw rude guests handled with deferential applomb and left beaming. We noticed the excellence of the entire department, who made it blithe for us to lounge the day away. In particular, Jean, Sam and Jenna charmed their way into our hearts, and supervisors Ali and Vanessa ensured we were being coddled. We will return to this hotel because of this department. I splurged and booked a King Suite w/ balcony, Disney view and a dining table for four. I checked and my rate was cheaper than a deluxe king room in the Hilton Times Square (42nd St. NYC) for the same dates. We both agree, if this was not our best hotel or resort experience, it was certainly on the shortest list (and I've been criticizing Orlando hotels since 1972). Hilton knows how to price a room and they're still building the clientele of this property, so even in-season rates may be low for awhile. Eventually, this property will collect a premium on every other hotel room in Orlando, and be worth it.

We had a personal concierge who spent a huge amount of time with us in the room (possibly too much!) after check-in sharing loads of information about the parks and other options. Stayed in a king-bed suite with disney view which was huge. It had a wet bar (basically a kitchenette without cooking facilities), a dining table for 4, livingroom with sofabed and a Nespresso machine. Masses of closet space which was bliss as we were not tripping over suitcases or shoes. Bathroom was also huge with a separate bath and shower, high quality toiletries including bath salts, and more towels than we knew what to do with. We watched the fireworks every night from the balcony (can see both Epcot and Magic Kingdom). Pool area was gorgeous. Pool boys and girls prepare your bed with towels immediately and bring a change during the day too. Nice chilled out music in the background. Yes, cocktails are expensive, but you're on holiday, just grin and bear it. The food at the pool bar is delicious and reasonably priced - amazing tacos with seared tuna. Went round to the neighbouring Hilton to use the lazy river. It was very busy, you had to walk to the kiosk for towels, and it felt like a noisy holiday resort. Soon returned to the calm of the Waldorf! Dined at the Italian restaurant in the Hilton two nights as the Waldorf's restaurant was more aimed at adult fine-dining and therefore not great for kids. You don't even have to walk the short distance if you don't want to as hotel staff will drive you round on a golf buggy.

Check-in: We had 2 king rooms booked and Adam & Byron arrange for us to have the 13th floor AND with DISNEY views. The rooms were STUNNING with great beds and superb housekeeping standards. The robes are wonderful and we actually bought one as a gift. The Pool: What fantastic staff! From day one we noticed that the \"supervisors\" who managed the bar and pool area (Ali and Vanessa) were very efficient and kept all the staff on their toes. They had a terrific team who were SO attentive and I must mention Shanna and Jerome who seemed to love their job and made the guests feel good. While we were there we witnessed a very troublesome guest who was always professionally handled and all credit to the hotel team for that!!!! We enjoyed the luxury of a Cabana one day and these are highly recommended! Love to the pool team from the Sinclairs! Dining/drinking: We used Peacock Alley, Sir Harry's and Bull & Bear. We thought prices were reasonable especially for cocktails (around $9). Service was impecable and friendly... never in the least stuffy! The steaks at B & B were incredible. It was my birthday and a complimentary desert, complete with candle, was provided. Such a nice touch! We enjoyed rooms service one night and our only complaint would be we had too much food!!! We loved the valet parking and the fact that the staff welcome you back to the hotel after every trip. Valet parking can be a bit pricey but it was a special holiday and added to the luxury. The car was always delivered promptly with no issues whatsoever! This is undoubtably a luxury hotel however you need not worry about feeling it will not be relaxed as the team do everything to look after you and give you a great time.

My room was outstanding, scrupulously clean, with large overstuffed furniture, big marble bath with separate glass shower, stacks of huge towels, robes, high-end bath products, etc. I loved the Nespresso espresso/coffee machine and free bottled water, as well.

We found a table and I thought, forget it, we'll never get service. Then I noticed staff members from all over the hotel streaming in to help with the unexpected overflow of bar patrons (it was almost 11 p.m.). Clearly, the hotel immediately recognized the situation and responded. Our drink orders were taken promptly and delivered to us in no time. When several other friends joined our table, they were quickly served. Nice work! My room was freshly made up promptly each day. I noticed little things, like my papers were neatly restacked, or shoes realigned into a straight line. During turn-down service each night they freshened up the room again, closed the drapes and put the TV on soothing music channel and a lamp so I wouldn't return to a dark room.

The pool is very comfortable and the cabanas, although a little pricey are very enjoyable on day you are planning to simply relax at the hotel. Transportation is available to the theme parks and is direct between the Hilton/Waldorf Bonnet Creek. Will we go back again... the answer is a resounding YES!

I travel quite a bit as a consultant and consider myself to be a hotel snob over the years after getting spoiled on business travel. This was family vacation. From the first step till leaving, the Waldorf is the best experience I've ever had at a hotel. Soon as the doors are opened for you, the cool air and a fresh smell hits you in the face, and you are greeted with chilled champagne. Check in was smooth and Steve our bellman gave us brief tour of hotel on the way to room. Room was a suite overlooking pool and golf course. Beautiful. Could see Epcot fireworks every night. Room is expected clean. High end decor and trim in room impressive. Robes, Espresso machine, fridge with wine rack, etc. Pull out bed for kids was comfy, not a foam pad with bars poking your back. Bed is absolutely the most comfortable ever! King size triple down - like being swallowed by a marshmallow. Food - while on the higher end, outstanding is only way to describe. If you're coming for chicken fingers and pizza, go to Pop Century. The hotel connects to Hilton Bonnet creek (which their restaurants were great too. They offered a mid tier price level where kids eat free). Pools - quiet, beautiful. As mentioned, can go over to Hilton pool across property. That pool is better for kids with lazy river and water slide. This one more crowded. We like coming back to our quiet retreat when kids got tired. Service - second to none. Front desk, Concierges, bellman, - everything great. Had some issues with transportation - Concierge Jeremy promptly took care of it. My daugther lost a disney trading pin while walking to restaurant. I asked if it got turned in to lost and found - later that night the front office mgr Zoltan called me. He \"found\" a new one through \"friend\". That was on our final night - he didn't have to do that and it made my daughter's day. Nice touch. All the employess seemed generally happy here, and happy to help. If you're considering a high end Disney resort vs here, it's a no-brainer. You pay $300+ at those to stay on property. This location is very close to all parks and has free transpo on air conditioned buses to parks. I've now done both. The Disney rooms are like Holiday Inn express - similar service. What you're paying for is the grounds and theme of resort. Here you get best of everything - service, beautiful pool, great room, food.

Housekeeping service was excellent, timely and unobtrusive - I love the fact you don't see their carts in the hallway. Even though the Hilton and Waldorf are connected - both indoors and outdoors - I prefer the Waldorf side. It's definitely quieter and less crowded. As a Waldorf guest, you can use the Hilton pool area which includes a lazy river and slide. My husband and 12 year daughter played golf each morning. Very attentive staff, the driving range is well maintained (free tees and ball markers) and the course was in excellent condition. There's no coffee maker in the room, but just go down to the lobby to get a complimentary cup in the morning.

We booked a suite which was spacious and very luxuroius. Plenty of room for the four of us, large living room with bar (Nespresso, fridge) and a sleeping sofa for the children. The bedroom was big with a fantastic bed. The bathroom had a seperate bath, a large shower, sink and wc. There was a second 1/2 bathroom with wc and sink. All suites have balconies. We overlooked the pool area and had a great view over the golf courses. At night we could see the fireworks at Epcot. Everything is very clean, the resort is very luxurious! The Waldorf has a great swimmingpool and enough longchairs for the guests. And there is a Great gym! Besies all the facilities at The Waldorf there are restaurants, a swimmingpool etc. at the adjoining Hilton hotel. We have not used the restaurants except for Oscar's for breakfast. The buffet was very good. The Waldorf Astoria is situated on a perfect location to visit all the theme parks, specially the Disney parks which are all very nearby. Location is also very close to the I4 highway. After been to Orlando two times before we chose the Waldorf Astoria over the Ritz Carlton because of the very spacious rooms. Overall the hotel is fantastic. There are however some things which also have to be said: - service is great but this is not experieenced with all the staff. Everbody at Valet were very nice and helpful, the staff at Oscar's did a great job but the staff at the reception (not all of them) were a bit detached and formal. We experienced overall a much friendlier staff at the Ritz Carlton! - although the rooms were clean and we did not have the beds to be changed daily (we used the card to say when the bedlinen could stay) we experienced that sheets were not changed when indicated. - most doubtful: we asked for a late check out because our (total over 12 hour) flight was early in the evening. This was not a simple thing to arrange. The check out is at 11.00 and a complimentary hour is given by the hotel if possible. Actually the hotel was not at all completely booked so we could not see the problem. But the strangest thing is that we had to pay by the hour for a longer use of the room. After a stay for THREE weeks we tought that this was very unusual. We have stayed in several hotels for shorter or longer stays but have never experienced this sort of formal attitude! We think this is dealing by the rules but aso very unprofessional, every rule can be changed per situation.

My only beef was that there is piped in music everywhere (hallways, elevators, patio, common areas), so if you just want to read a book on the patio and have some quiet time, you need to \"tune out\" the music or head back to your room.

It is, at best, a 4 star with a staff that needs a bit more training. Check-in: This was quick. I was not accommodated with the king bed request, but that was not a big deal. Two queen beds were fine. They also \"upgraded\" me to a \"park view\" room so I could watch the fireworks at night. The view was actually quite impressive and I did enjoy the fireworks. Bell Service: It took almost 30 minutes to get the bags from the car to our room. Normally I wouldn't care, but the baby's diapers and food were in those bags. So that was quite inconvenient and unacceptable for this hotel. A plus for the bell service: They did help us install the car seat into the rental car. This was highly appreciated. Room cleaning staff: Out of all three days we were there, the room was never cleaned before 3:00 PM. This was totally unacceptable and quite inconvenient when we had to bring the baby back for his nap. Additionally the ice bucket was only filled up once during the entire stay, despite the fact that I had a wine bottle in it the entire time. Once again, not a big deal, if you are staying at a 4 star hotel. Valet service: Generally quick and efficient. highly appreciated. One complaint is that I asked them if they could pull the car around because we left a package in the car. They said no need to pull around, they would check for us and bring it in. We never heard from them again on the topic. Since we found the package in our room, I can't complain too much though :) Rooms: I had the normal double queen room, and found them to be quite small. (I did know this going in though.. so no complaints). The blankets on the bed were quite heavy. I need to be covered the whole night and I couldn't because I was sweating profusely. This caused me to wake up several times during the night. The beds, though, in general we comfortable. The blu ray player in the room was appreciated, and kept baby happy. The rooms were ok... I hate to keep repeating myself, but think 4 star ok. Nothing special. Robes and slippers were something you find in a Radisson... the toiletries were nothing special... The one thing that was very tacky was the Voss bottled water in the room with a $6 price tag on it. C'mon... really... in a supposed 5 star hotel. Food: We didn't try the room service or the any of the resort restaurants, so I cannot comment on that. The coffee in the lobby was very good in the morning. The remove it way too early though. Overall, for the money, I would rather stay in the Radisson Lake Buena Vista. The rooms are a little bigger, they have large flat screen TVs and you get the same basic service (minus valet parking). Granted it is listed as a 4 star hotel... but that is what it is!

It is luxurious and elegant with a very modern exterior (not what I expected). Staff was the most professional, courteous and extremely helpful (with the exception of a couple of valet personnel, who acted like they were doing me or management a favor - the only drawback from a hotel that receives the highest marks in each and every category you can come up with). The turndown service was the best I've had - I returned to a room with classical music on the large flat screen tv, slippers by my bed, bench cleared off, water by the bedside. I was so impressed that I wrote her a note with a nice tip (as I had forgotten to leave one in my haste to go shopping) and left it with the front desk. The bathroom offers you a separate tub from a shower; and while I love a good soak, I take a bath in a hotel - except here. A single king size room is very large and I believe the sofa maybe a pull out. I don't sleep well when I travel, especially alone, yet I fell asleep immediately in the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, anywhere. I even removed the linen to find out the brand so I could buy the pillows, they were perfect. This is a quiet, sophisticated hotel and I didn't see the usual unruly, screaming kids running around; especially for being located in the Epcot resort area of Walt Disney World. I would even recommend staying here while visiting any of the Orlando area theme parks (check to confirm but you can always buy the Express Passes instead of staying at one of the property's hotels), or while on business in downtown (which is where I had to travel to). I didn't have much time to enjoy The Guerlain Spa, but I did treat myself to a wash/style inside their hair salon (so convenient to have one in the hotel, instead of driving to another location) - which is high end and accordingly priced. The stylist did a great job on my hair, but the Florida humidity is cruel and one of the least attractive parts of summer; so keep this in mind. I only got to stay one night but I will most certainly return with either the hubby for a romantic visit or with the teenagers for a family outing. Needless to say, I absolutely loved this place and it is definitely my favorite hotel (favorite resort - Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, NY). **NOTE** I did have a problem locating this hotel on both my Garmin GPS system and my IPad2's GPS application (not worth the $30 cost).

View over Disney parks in the distance and the golf club in the foreground were beautiful but even more inpresive was the pool area which was always inviting. The room was most comfortable, beds were a joy to sleep in. Bathroom was also a delight, with towels chamged whenever required and sundries were always replaced regularly. The peacock Lounge was used often by my wife and I, it was such a relaxing place to be. A grand piano being played every evening by a very accomplished pianist (my daughter plays, so she should know) made it all the more special. The serving staff were also very attentive, special mention of Jill who got to know our likes and dis-likes, I hope she gets her wish and succeeds in the hotel trade, she does have the qualifications, and the will, i'm sure. The pool area was great for relaxing, beds were very comfortable and staff always ready to help everyone settle down for a days sunbathing. Pool staff would bring cold facial towels, frozen grapes or melon and and drinks through-out the day to help keep you cool. The pool side bar served delicious food and drink all day. The staff here were also brilliant. In case Andrew who serves at the bar reads this. \"Thanks for taking the bet on the World Cup Ladies Final\". The Waldorf Astoria Golf Club was a joy to play, all 4 rounds that we managed to get in. As one who normally prefers to play a few different courses in the area, on this occasion we only went to one course, Falcons Fire G.C., outside the resort. This was due to the great service at the resort course, turning up well before tee off allowed you time for complementary coffee or tea with a good selection of cakes and pastries. The restroom was also well stocked with various toiletries after your round. Maybe they could look at giving hotel guests a better price, but that is NOT a complaint. My wife and daughter visited the Spa for some treatments. They had nothing but compliments about the place, might try it myself next time.

Our bed was oddly higher at the foot - not sure what the cause of that was - it was just odd. The linens & pillows were nice. The bathroom was luxe with a separate tub/shower. The live music on Friday & Saturday night in the \"Peacock Alley\" lounge was fantastic. There were some interesting libations listed on the lounge menu so we tried several of them. My \"Alpine Pear\" cocktail ($14) was wonderful until I noticed a dead fly was floating in it. The server was kind enough to bring another one promptly when I pointed this out to her, but I was a little surprised that it wasn't complimentary...not that I'm looking for something for free, but I guess I kinda expected that level of service from a 5-star when you serve someone an insect. On Friday night (1-2am) there was an overnight party with loud music, etc., going on in a room adjacent to that of the other couple in our party. Security went to the offending room, but afterward there was banging on the door and prank doorbell ringing which was disconcerting & frankly, a little scary - particularly since our group had not interacted with them at all & had left it up entirely to security to resolve. Though the following day, hotel staff were nice enough to move the other couple in our party to another room on a different floor.

I called to try and cancel the meals for my husbnad and I, but the food was already en route to our room. I told them to just leave the food for my daughter - that we couldn't eat because we'd be at the emergency room. I fully expected them to charge us for the entire dinner - they made it, I ordered it.

Last year we tried the JW Marriott on the recommendation of a friend, but we wanted to be closer to Disney this year. We narrowed our choices down to the Waldorf and the Grand Floridian. Having stayed at the GF before we knew that although we liked the convenience and the main area of the hotel, but that the rooms themselves were not so great. After hearing good things about the Waldorf we chose to stay there. Pros: * The Waldorf is located on the Disney property. It is very close to everything. * We found the staff and service to be terrific. Wonderful check in and bell service. We called ahead for our car about 10 minutes before we left and it was waiting for us every time. * Our suite was wonderful. We were in a corner suite on the 15th floor--the side facing Disney. We had a wonderful view of the Epcot fireworks. Bathroom had great amenities and linens were great. We had a large living room area and a kitchenette with a dining table. We enjoyed breakfast in the room several times. Both the bedroom and the living room had flat screen televisions. This allowed for mom and dad to watch the news, etc. in the living room while the kids watched what they wanted in the bedroom. * The turn down service, chocolates, slippers, robes, etc. were so nice and appreciated at the end of a hectic day in the parks. * We enjoyed the wide selection of newspapers and the complimentary coffee each day. * Although we did not use it, the hotel does offer bus transportation to and from the parks. * The lobby and main areas of the hotel were nicely appointed and pretty quiet. It was a nice escape from the crowds/heat/noise of Disney at the end of each day. *One example of excellent service: We took the kids over to the Hilton to use the lazy river. On the way back, the shuttle was delayed. The staff immediately offered to take us in the hotel's Escalade, offered chilled water, etc.. Cons: * I agree with the poster who was upset about the Coke situation. Although we had a mini Sub-Zero fridge in our kitchen that we could have stocked up (we did this the second night) we did not have time to do this the first night of arrival. I found the lack of a mini-bar inconvenient. * For some reason, we received washcloths when we checked into the room but never again despite requesting them. * Charging for the internet is ridiculous. Wireless internet is complimentary at most three star and below hotels. It should be included in the price of the room.

If you want a true 5 star experience you are going to have to stay at the Ritz Carlton. I commend the management on some things. For example, on check in, when we had been promised adjoining rooms when we booked, we found that they had put us across the hall from each other. When I refused to split the family and was ready to go elsewhere, the management actually upgraded us to a suite with an adjoining room for no extra charge. It was a spectacular suite. Well, the issue isn't the willingness of the staff, they are all very nice with good intentions and seem very capable. It's the forethought put into the way things are done here with the food services and other ancillary services like the valet. For example: twice, when we needed food or drink after 10 pm we were given the option of either ridiculously expensive room service(8 bucks for a coke), or \"going to the Hilton next door\"! You have got to be kidding ? Oh, don't worry about how far it is. \"there is a shuttle\". What an incredible joke for a supposed 5 star property to be sending it's guests to a 4 star property 300 yards away to get a damn coke! ( also no stocked minibars) . Another time we just needed a sandwich. Same deal- Hilton or room service. Then, for the valet, the guy has to run super far to the , you guessed it, Hilton parking deck, to even get to where they park you car to get it too you. We never had a wait under 10 minutes and had several more like 20 minutes for the car to be brought out. If you are in a hurry to drive anywhere you better call ahead - way ahead. Local car service to places nearby also costs around 15 to 20 bucks for a short trip. Nice to have it available, but it is complimentary at many 5 star properties. Also room service itself is super slow. 50 minute wait for burgers and a sandwich our first night when we were tired and hungry and arrived late. Had to stay up another hour and a half just to eat!. Food service at the pool - same deal - very slow and inconsistent. Wife at pool said waitress at pool didn't return with drink for 30 minutes and then forgot her bill so she had to get up and go find her. So, I feel this place is rated 5 star based on it's name and it's sister property in New York. If it had any other name and had to be rated based on their actual performance right now they wouldn't be a 5 star property because of the service issues. It looked 5 star , but it isn't. It seems that while the staff is great and very willing( sent me a complimentary coke when I complained about having to go the Hilton for one), that some of these issues just haven't been thought out well by whoever is ultimately in charge. So, lot of loose ends right now in terms of service but not so much quality of the people but the systems themselves. They need a consultant to come in a fix this stuff. I definitely would not stay here again with all these inconveniences when you expect a 5 star hotel not to present any whatsoever .", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frisco, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPerfect.\u201d", "Author": "BeachGal3333", "ReviewID": "UR114985773", "Content": "We stayed at the Waldorf Orlando in late November 2010.

From the valet to the bellman to the pool guys...everyone has been exceptionally attentive. Awesome food (yes, expensive, but you're in Orlando). The rooms are nice. Probably the one area in which they can improve slightly. Small things. No coffer makers in the rooms. Our room is supposed to have a couch, but there is only a chair...so either my wife or I has to always sit on the bed. The walls are a bit thin - we heard the neighbors talking last night.

Second, when we entered the room, I realized that there were no drinks or snacks available in the fridge. Empty! When I called the operator, the lady told me thats the way it was there and gave me an attitude. She said that I needed to call room service to get these things ordered. Honestly, I was tired and didn't want to call and wait for another 20 minutes for someone to deliver a beer to my room. My mood was already gone! Third, House-keeping forgot to make our room the first day so we needed to launch a complain to the front desk in late afternoon. Luckily, the lady at the front desk was very professional and took care of the matters. Forth, after a long hot day in the WDW, my daughter wanted to take a bath but found hair and other dirty stuffs in the bath tub. Fifth, the choices of cuisine in the property's restaurants (excluding Hilton) and the hours of operations are very limited. If I wanted to have a late lunch at 2:40pm or a late night snack/ice cream at 11:45pm, I had to call room service. Sixth, the valet was super slow in getting my car ready each day despite I called 20 minutes ahead. It doesnt really worth the $20 comparing with other 5-star neighbor hotels.

I decided to treat my partner to a very special private dinner, after checking with the fantastic lady concierge I learned that they had no private rooms that were small enough for 2 people ( quite understandable too ) she suggested an in room dining experience and set up a meeting with the In room dining manager Gino Rincon. He could not have been more helpful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the dinner, he made great suggestions and then followed them all through.

This particular visit was very special in that I was there celebrating my 40th birthday. My husband had surprised me with a grand birthday trip to Aruba just a few weeks prior to this. While Aruba was breathtakingly beautiful, their accommodations left a little to be desired. I am a recovering \u201chotel snob\u201d and while there, I couldn\u2019t help thinking (out loud) about the Waldorf. My very perceptive husband took the hint and the rest as they say, is history. We arrived at the Waldorf and just like on our two subsequent visits, the valet personnel were courteous and professional. Throughout the duration of our week long stay, we were always offered cold waters as we entered/exited our vehicle. Additionally, they were always more than happy to provide driving directions. My husband would like for me to send a special thank you to William. He remembers us year after year and goes out of his way to be cordial\u2026 thank you William. At check-in, much to our surprise, we\u2019d already been checked \u2013in! After a very FULL flight, we really just wanted to get to our room. So, this was a very thoughtful gesture. Everyone at the front desk knew that it was my birthday and extended to me very kind birthday wishes. I was very appreciative of the warm sentiments. As we began to walk away from the desk, my family and I were shocked (in a good way) when a lovely young lady, wearing a warm smile, appeared from a side door. She introduced herself as Nicola Gonda, the Personal Concierge Supervisor for the Waldorf Astoria Orlando. We knew exactly who she was- as she had made us feel so welcome on our last visit. We were unable to meet with her on our last stay; and it was really nice to finally meet her and express our thanks for the awesome job she\u2019s doing. Now, my family and I travel a lot. We\u2019ve never however, had the Concierge Supervisor personally escort us to our room. Nicola did just that. We had been upgraded to a MAGNIFICANT suite with a BEAUTIFUL view! Nicola stood by silently as my husband, son and I, toured the room. She allowed me to \u201cstumble\u201d upon a gorgeous birthday cake, compliments of the Waldorf! I was speechless\u2026my husband and I are still trying to figure out how she obtained the picture for the cake. Not to be left out, Nicola even provided a little something special for the dinosaur lover in the family. Who, just like a kid, conveniently mentioned that he\u2019s phasing out his love for dinosaurs\u2026kids! Throughout the trip, special things like this were done for us. I was even left a cute gift basket from housekeeping! The customer service and hospitality of the Waldorf Astoria Orlando continues to be unmatched. The hotel is I believe, entering into it\u2019s third year and it looks as immaculate as it did during it\u2019s opening year. Everything continues to be clean and in wonderful condition. Even the cabanas around the pool were in top shape. As you know, being exposed to the elements, pool furniture and the like can get a bit worn. Sitting inside our cabana we took notice of how nice everything looked.

My wife and I spent a few days at the amusement parks, and after each long day, spending the evening, chillaxing in our room was just as great as our daytime activities. For the first time staying at a hotel, I literally felt like I was at home. The furniture and decor made the stay comfortable and having two--yes, TWO--large flat screens was amazing. The staff were great. They were friendly and engaging. At breakfast the chef pointed out the crab meat for omelets, and I joked that they needed avocados. The chef was willing to somehow acquire avocados based on my simple joking. That's service! Lastly the attention to detail is what really blew me away. No detail was overlooked.The toiletries, by Agraria, were lavish (I love the pomegranate smell). This is the first room I ever seen that had a Blu-Ray player and a Sub-Zero mini-fridge.

I won't repeat what has already said about the positive attributes of the hotel, including a very nice, beautiful room with a wonderful view of the pool, spacious bathroom, nice desk with good lighting and many plug-in outlets. The two downsides to staying here was that the hotel maid service moved my personal toiletries from the sink counter into a drawer in the bathroom. Unfortunately, I do not like my personal things moved around. When I came back to my room in the afternoon, I could not find my personal toiletries including my medications where I had left them. Long story short, a call to the front desk and then a visit by hotel security solved the mystery. My items had been moved into a drawer that really did not look like a drawer. I still did not appreciate my things being moved around by hotel staff. The second mishap was an error on my hotel bill discovered after I returned home. A hotel guest from the adjacent Hilton Hotel property had eaten lunch at the Waldorf and correctly put his hotel room number on the bill on the Hilton Hotel line (versus the Waldorf Astoria line). Yet, the accounting staff charged that to my hotel invoicel. After two phone calls to the hotel for a copy of the signed receipt restaurant ticket uncovered the error. The hotel should have at least compared the printed name written by the guest against the name that came up printed on the receipt. They would have noticed that the names did not match. Long story short, the Waldorf reversed the charge. I'm glad I reviewed that bill because I would have had to pay for a $23 lunch. While the Waldorf Astoria is a nice hotel, I would probably stay at the Hilton Hotel next door, which is probably a better bargain and has a more family oriented pool scene.

Steve - one of the guys who works outside - was great about shuttling us over to the Hilton and back with his golf cart. A super friendly guy. Service at the Waldorf pool was a little slow at times; I had to track down the pool guy to do our towel set-up and even though I pushed the button on the lounge chair for drink/food service, no one came until I hunted someone down for that too. But the pools were nice. We ate mostly at the poolside restaurant at the Waldorf, called Aquamarine--a nice lunch selection including a yummy guava drink. We also ate several times at the Harvest Bistro at the Hilton next door (kids eat for free during breakfast or dinner, if you purchase an adult entree or adult buffet). The best meal of the trip was at La Luce at the Hilton next door. Great service and fabulous food. Even though it's a fancier restaurant they have a kid-friendly pizza with just cheese and tomato sauce (\"no green stuff\") which comes with french fries on top (much to my daughter's enjoyment).

Free breakfast at Oscars, complimentary glass of wine each night of my stay at the Peacock Lounge, free wireless Internet access and as an added bonus $50 resort credit per each night of my stay.

Living in Orlando, we decided on trying the Waldorf Astoria out as our weeekend \"destination.\" Overall I thought the hotel was very nice. We were looking for an upscale hotel to stay at that would allow us the opportunity to go to some of our restaurants and such. The Waldorf, on the outside, is asthetically pleasing. Well manicured drive up with fountains etc. However, I cannot say that I was wowed by it. With a regular Hilton hotel right next door that looks strikingly similar, I'm not sure it has the initial wow factor that one would look for with the \"Astoria\" name. But certainly don't get hung up on that. I am writing the review the hotel all around. Normally I'm not too picky, but I want to give our full review. As you pull up you are quickly welcomed by a very attentive staff. The valet crew were on their game the entire stay, and we never waited for our car. That includes the night in which that had a very large NBA team's x-mas party there. Check-in was very easy, and they were attentive to any details that we had on our reservation. The Lobby is certainly the centerpiece of the hotel. They had it all decked out for Christmas, but it certainly had a granduer about it. We had a king bed, deluxe room. The room, upon entering was very nice. With a king size bed and then a sitting area with sofa certainly gave the room a large and accomodating feel. My wife loved the large bathroom, and I thought the seperate shower and jacuzzi tub were a very nice touch. Very very clean, and the room itself was well put together. The decor stayed with the many gold shades that you find in the lobby. During our stay we did not eat at any of the restaurants as we went offsite both nights. We were not there for Disney, so that did not factor in the weekend. The Waldorf is owned by Hilton, and if you are in need of any internet service, you will have to pay for it. For me, that probably has turned into my biggest travel pet peeves! The only other quasi complaint i'll have is the parking. The valet was very nice, and very efficient, but the self parking was adjacent to the other Hilton hotel, and still a pay/day and not close if you had to walk out. The workout facilities were very nice. We did not use the spa or golf course or pool as it was cold and rainy. Overall, it was an excellent hotel that I would recommend to many others. I cannot complain about our stay. It is not the New York Waldorf Astoria, so if you can come in without any pre concieved images, you will really love this place. Hopefully this helps!

The hotel is located on the Bonnet Creek Parkway, sharing grounds with the Hilton Bonnet Creek and the Wyndham Vaction Club properties, near Lake Buena Vista at Disney Main Gate. The Waldorf Astoria Orlando exudes elegance and class from the moment you arrive. Staff was friendly upon check in and had tons information on dining, golfing, spa, and Disney World attractions. There is a shuttle bus that runs every half hour from the property to area Disney theme parks. We were able to leave our car parked for the entire trip and utilize the shuttle service to get to and from Disnay and LBV dining/restaurants. On Sunday nights in the Peacock Alley Lounge at the hotel, there is a pianist that is wonderful to listen to and enjoy a cocktail or coffee. We ate at the Bull and Bear restaurant on property for appetizers and drinks and found the dark-wood bar inviting and cozy to slink into and relax.

We are Disney experts and have made several trips. This was our first time staying off-property. We chose the Waldorf Astoria Orlando due to being Hilton Diamond members and having a free stay. As far as the hotel goes, it is beautiful! Upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite (without even asking), which was amazing! In the suite we had a large eating area with refrigerator and a large living room area complete with a nightly view of the Disney fireworks and a large flat panel TV. The bedroom had 2 queen beds, large flat panel TV, ample closet space, and an idock for your iPhone or iPod. The bathroom was spacious with marble tile and a separate shower. The service, cleanliness, and comfort could not have been better. The staff is practically tripping over themselves to assist your every need. As mentioned, we traveled with 2 young boys. Our children were treated very well and were not made to feel unwelcome as other posts have suggested. That being said, the Walforf Astoria is definitely not kid friendly. We did not see any other children for the duration of our stay. When at the pool, we felt the need to constantly remind our kids to be quiet and not splash. However, the connecting Hilton Bonnet Creek is SUPER kid friendly. If you have children, stay there instead. We spent much of our time next-door (there is a complimentary golf cart shuttle) at the Hilton's pool which has a waterslide. The Hilton also has a weekly movie night by the pool. Be sure to ask for a printed schedule of events. The Hilton offers lots of little \"extras.\" That being said, we are not regretful that we stayed at the WA, we just probably would not do it again with kids. If you are looking for a full Disney experience, you probably do not want to stay at the Hilton or Waldorf. Though the location is very convenient, there is definitely a disconnect. The resort transportation is nowhere near as convenient as the Disney resort busses. We had an issue where the bus was very late so we ended up driving our own car to the park and having to pay for parking. I will say that the resort made up for this 110% without us having to put up a fuss. They sent complimentary cookies and milk to our room that night w/ an apology letter and gladly removed that day's valet fee from our bill. How could we complain after that level of service recovery? Speaking of valet fees, if you have a car, it must be valeted and you are charged approx. $22 per day for this fee. Obviously, tipping is also necessary every time you need to access your car. Bring your wallet to the Waldorf; you will need it! The pool guys and gals that set up the pool chairs and umbrellas will also bring you cool wash cloths while you are sunbathing. This is a super nice touch, but is another area that you'll need to tip. The pool-side restaurant and bar are VERY expensive as well. The same goes for the Hilton.

This hotel is excellent. We were staying with my three sister in laws + husbands/boyfriend + 2 babies. We arrived after a very trying Virgin flight from Manchester. It was the first time that we had travelled with the new baby and we were very tired! The moment we arrived we felt a massive weight off our shoulders. The Waldorf is pretty much brand new, so it is all sparkling! There are hundreds of staff all very eager to please with big smiles and efficient manner. Apparently the hotel runs at between 20% and 60% occupancy, which would explain the excellent service. Room service takes 5 minutes, as does baggage pickup and car delivery etc. Our room overlooked the front of the hotel, which was quite good, but did not compare with my sister in laws room which overlooked the pool - This looked BEAUTIFUL at night. Being American you get two double beds which is great since Mrs M-B is very pregnant and separate beds is a real treat! The duvets and pillows wear virtually worth taking home with you, as were the bathrobes - none of your standard white towelling robes in sight! It had one of those Bose radio ipod things and a huge TV. Bathroom was spotless with huge walk in shower, seperate bath and a set of scales! All very upmarket. Unfortunately they had not put in the cot that we had ordered. I called reception and ten minutes later a knock at the door annaounced a guy with a single bed! Apparently what I wanted was a 'crib' not a 'cot'. 10 minutes later the 'crib' arrived - what you and I would call a big cot! We were very tired and only managed a couple of drinks in the bar before bed without dinner. At 2 am I called for some warm milk for the baby. Delivered in 2 mins ($8.39 for a glass of milk might be considered expensive by most!). The girls went for a day at the pool while the boys played golf at the club twent yards away. It is the Astoria Golf Club but kind of shared with the Hilton next door, I think. Our round of golf was $100 dollars but, like the hotel, the service and facilities were excellent. After a light breakfast from the golfers buffet I stepped into my freshly cleaned shoes with my gleaming clubs. The buggies (included) had the inbuilt gps screens that you could email for assistance and order food through. This and the course made it a great morning. We had lunch with the girls in the golf club. Excellent burgers etc. There was virtually no check out costs when we checked out at 2 pm since we had prepaid - through Travel Republic. \u00a3120 a night. Absolute bargain. We came back a week later. This time it was only Mrs M-B and Hector staying but everyone piled in to use the pool for the day - maybe a bit cheeky but we spent ALOT at the pool bar! The pool facilities are very good. The loungers have a buzzer thingy on them to call a waiter, the frozen margaritas are as good as you will get, and the food is excellent. We had a boozy lunch after another round of awesome golf. $400 for lunch for six is quite alot but the rooms are quite cheap so you kind of make up for it that way. Mrs M-B had a facial in the spa. $180 but it was very good! We departed very early the next day to goto SeaWorld so missed out on any breakfast so cannot comment on that and I fell asleep before dinner so cannot comment on the Bull and Bear steakhouse. My only gripe was the room on the second stay had a kingsize bed but felt quite tight when the cot was in there too. Admittedly we had alot of luggage and there was a sofa in there too, but i think if I had been there for longer I would have asked for a bigger room. At the end of the day the Waldorf Astoria in Orlando is just another big chain hotel. But it is very good and shiny new! Get in while you can...

Having stayed at the Boca Beach Club (also part of the Waldorf line) since it's major remodel, I was interested to see how this one measured up. As others have mentioned, the place is brand new so everything is pristine. From the front doors (which are beautiful), to the lobby (outstanding) to the rooms, it all works very well together. As a lot of others have mentioned, it's (seemingly) pretty easy to get upgraded to a suite for free. I am Hilton Gold, and the recognition program at this particular property is pretty robust. The suites are indeed amazing, at almost 1000 sq. ft. A blu-ray player and a wine fridge were nice touches. In terms of features, the rooms are better than those at the Boca Beach Club. My room was made up twice daily, and when I was about ready to go to the ice machine, I picked up the bucket and lo and behold, fresh ice was already there. The service was outstanding. One day I had gone overboard on the sun tanning and ended up with some pretty painful burns. The concierge at the front desk gave me a free drink ticket (on top of 2 that I had already received) and sent someone to the neighboring Hilton (after closing hours) to get me a bottle of \"Aloe Freeze.\" Although it was $15 (ouch) it was nice to have it delivered even though the gift store was closed. Probably the only downside of my stay was my trip to the Spa. Although the massage itself was outstanding (and very interactive), for $180 I would have expected the overall experience to be more of an \"experience.\" The Spa at the Boca Resort has this place beat hands down. At Boca, you can make a whole afternoon out of it. The massage beds weren't heated and the treatment room itself was too noisy. As great as the massage was, I'd have a tough time spending that kind of coin again. I did walk to the neighboring Hilton one morning and although it seemed nice, it was a noticable step down from the Waldorf. As others have stated, if you're looking to get away from the wet kids and old ladies who wear their swim suit cover-ups to the breakfast buffet, the Waldorf is the place to be. Going another BIG step down, after a couple of nights I had to move to the Swan/Dolphin in order to be closer to the conference I was supposed to be attending. I'll post my review of the Dolphin separately -- but WOW what a dump...totally unsatisfactory.

We were upgraded to a suite with a balcony for the entire stay by the evening manager. We also had a $100/night (!!) resort credit which was really nice. During the check in process it was clear that the staff were invested in making sure we were getting set up for a perfect stay and it really was just that. The valet parking is quick and organized if you want it, although you can save $20/night if you use the attached Hilton garage which is a 2 minute walk from the Waldorf front door. I had business in Orlando during the trip so it was very important that we had a place to stay where I could work comfortably and efficiently while my family vacationed and the Waldorf was perfect. You could be at a first class/business level resort anywhere and the staff is ready for the business traveller (incidentally they have excellent conference facilities). However, for the family the attraction is the beautiful and peaceful pool (and the walking proximity to the more \"fun\" Hilton pool with slide, lazy river, etc.) and the great food. The staff treated our children wonderfully and made them feel very special, especially the pool staff. One of the best parts of the entire experience is that if you are here for Disney, you are as close (or closer) to the parks than some of Disney's own hotels, but even though it is located within the Disney property, it is a world apart. Each day you can take their free shuttle (which is actually a luxury coach) to and from any park and then back again. At the end of a busy (and exhausting) day touring a park, you can retreat back to this oasis away from all the craziness. Not only is this nice for parents, we found it to be good for our kids to get them to settle down, take a break, swim and get a good rest for the next day. Speaking of rest, the room itself was terrific. The room was totally quiet, silent in fact. The bed was amazingly comfortable, the living room of the suite was great and the pull out bed was very nice for our son. There was a full table for 4, perfect for room service, and a small fridge, which was nice for laying in a supply of snacks. Overall, just a great room. In summary, if you are going to do Disney, this is really the only way to do it.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous Hotel, fantastic service\u201d", "Author": "Its_Tina", "ReviewID": "UR83749307", "Content": "Our stay at the Waldorf Astoria was superb.

The room was really nice and spacious, the bed big and very comfortable, big flat screen TV with good choice of films. The bathroom is lovely with a separate bath and shower and nice hotel toiletries. The supplied robes are absolutely wonderful, we wanted to buy one from the gift shop, but they are so popular they were out of stock. The living part of the suite was great with a 4 place table for room service, fridge with free water, a pretty good coffee machine, another TV and sofa & armchair. With a suite you also get a balcony, which we really liked, looking out over the pools and golf course. One thing I found a little strange, was that there were 3 phones in the bed/bathroom, but none in the living area. With our suite being at the rear of the hotel, we had views of Disney and could see the nightly fireworks at EPCOT and Magic Kingdom from our balcony at about 9PM, I'd stay here again just for the view, never mind all the other amenities. Valet parking is $20/night and there is a self-park option available for $13, but the valet service is great, it's worth it, they will also give you free water. They run a coach service to Disney, which we used one night, which was fine. The whole hotel is lovely, which you might expect as it's quite new and a Waldorf, the thing that set it above other \"very nice\" hotels was the level of service we got. It was exceptional from everyone we dealt with from the valet, bell-hop, reception, bar & restaurant staff, not just the people expecting a tip. The bars and restaurants we used were all excellent, if a little pricey (but you don't go to the Waldorf for cheap), the bar by the lobby has live music which was really nice. You can also go through the attached conference centre to the Hilton and use it's facilities as well. The pools were generally very quiet during the week, they got a bit busier at the weekend, but I didn't ever see more than about a third of the loungers occupied, which was really good as I don' t like crowded pools. The one thing that irritated me was their internet access policy, it's $10/day if you want it in your room. However, if you go down to the lobby or bar, it's free down there, so I don't really see why they need to charge you to have it upstairs, it can't cost them anything and I can get free wi-fi in a cheap 3* hotel.

It was great to see that a year later this wonderful property is still holding itself to a higher standard and delivering great customer service in a gorgeous setting. If you're looking for a true luxury hotel experience in Orlando, the Waldorf is definitely the way to go. Of course, most Orlando/Disney hotels tend to offer a more \"themed\" experience. There is nothing wrong with that, I've lodged at many of these types of hotels (Grand Floridian, Animal Kingdom Lodge, Boardwalk, Coronado Springs, etc.). The Waldorf offers an elegant alternative to these properties. Because the Waldorf is so close to all the Disney parks, guests get the best of both worlds - the opulence of a 5 star hotel and all the great \"themed\" activities that Orlando has to offer. Of course, beautiful hotels are not uncommon and the Waldorf is a shiny new property, so I must say that what really sets the Waldorf apart is the level of service. Prior to arrival, my wife contacted the Waldorf and informed them that I would be celebrating my birthday while at the resort. She also told them that my son, who loves animals, would be traveling with us. When we checked into our room we were greeted with champagne, wine, chocolate covered strawberries, and a card in honor of my birthday.

Raw French Toast, overcooked eggs, then undercooked the next day, chewy toast, then missing toast. Weak coffee no matter how often we asked for it to be stronger. Even though room service was included in our rate, at one point we gave up entirely & had breakfast at Epcot instead. They did offer to send replacements but it would have been better to get it right the first time. To be fair, my husband is a chef & we own a restaurant, so perhaps our standards are higher than others. We have spent the last 8 summers at Disney's Grand Floridian for our annual, week long Anniversay trip spending between $500-700 per night for rooms sized at 450-750 sq feet. Waldorf Astoria offered a 2 room suite nearly 1,000 sq feet in size. WA provides true 5 star service, not Disney star service, which, as anyone who has stayed at the GF can attest, is equivalent to 3 star service at 5 star prices. If you are the type of vacationer who believes most of your time is spent in theme parks so who cares about the room, then you probably won't appreciate what Waldorf has to offer. If, however, you are a traveler who values their hotel experience as much as the rest of the vacation, WA is the place to stay. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the convenienc of staying 'on the monorail' at the GF, the service at Waldorf is just too superior to pass up. My family will stay here from now on.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, South Wales", "Title": "\u201cFirst class luxury and service from the moment you arrive!\u201d", "Author": "melliemels", "ReviewID": "UR73765275", "Content": "Following a very disappointing stay at the Ritz Carlton Grande Lakes last summer, we were hopeful that the Waldorf would live up to its reputation as a first class hotel.

The rooms are fantastic with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and a great view of the pool, golf course and Disney parks in the distance.

We were warmly greeted and welcomed in and were so impressed by the interior that had we had a wait a bit for check-in, we would not have minded at all. But of course, they didn't make us wait. We were about an hour or so too early to check in but were placed in a room immediately. Now, we initially asked for a deluxe suite with a bit more space but didn't realize that this meant a king bed with a sleeper. Since we preferred two queen beds, we were immediately MOVED AND UPGRADED to a larger, more exquisite space w/a connecting room, which worked out perfectly! We were told that the room chosen for us was not prepared. So, we went out to lunch. When we returned, we entered into an impeccably luxurious space and a platter of fresh fruit welcoming us to our temporary home! By now, we were sold! We had a wonderful three nights stay, with a staff that somehow stayed one step ahead of our every need, who all looked as if they were enjoying their jobs, and who made my husband and me feel like a king and queen traveling w/their prince and princess!

We booked again with at the Waldorf for a 7 night getaway for the 4th of July holiday weekend... and my opinion of this hotel has not changed at all... this hotel is first class, and is affordable. I cannot write enough on this hotel, except that it is top notched. When you come and stay at a hotel as this, you must expect to use Valet parking. The parking garage is quite a walk to both the Hilton and the Waldorf, but Valet parking is close and it was worth it, since most of the week we were there, it was raining. Bell service is superb. I was surprised to find that the gentleman who checked us out the last time was the one who would greet us into our new room. Since I can't use any names here, I will say that he remembered who we were and later in the week greeted us again with a special package that he, himself, put together for our family. This was beyond our expectation and was a thoughtful gesture to us to make us feel at home. Our room was more than adequate. If you get a Deluxe Suite, you should book for a room that over looks Disney and arrive early. If you're fortunate enought, you'll get one of the \"end\" suites, which are bigger than the ones in the middle. This was close to 900 sq. ft. of space and had two bathrooms, a wet bar, expresso machine, refridgerator, two large screen tvs, a king size bed and a pull out mattess couch. The view was spectacular, since we had one window in the living room which over looked the golf course, and faced toward Hollywood Studios, and the other window in the bedroom overlooked the pool where the cabanas are. The bed was comfortable, with goose feather downs and feathered pillows, which I didn't respond too well to, so I asked the front desk if they could bring an alternative, and they were more than happy to defeather our room so that I could sleep comfortably without sneezing. We used room service about 5 times: 1 for dessert, 2 for breakfast, and 2 for dinner, and it was consistent each time. Basically, whatever time you put down for breakfast to be delivered, breakfast was ready to go before that time. Coffee is free downstairs at the bar area, and it does shut down at 9am, so if you do order in room breakfast, just go downstairs for the free stuff. Shuttle service to the park is posted on the website, or you can get it at the front desk. We did not use this service, but it seemed that the bus ran on time. It does run to Magic Kingdom every half hour, and it does run very late. We didn't use it because of children, and lugging around a stroller, but we would have used it if the circumstances were different. House cleaning comes twice a day, and they are sweet ladies who will work and chat with you if you want. They clean everything and tuck away shoes, and later in the evening will get it ready for bed for you to slip right in. The pool area is great since they have a zero entrance side of one pool, so the kids can play and you can just sit back and relax. You can also use the lazy river and pool area at the Hilton as well.

We had booked a regular double queen room, but were a bit concerned how our daughter would manage in a regular bed, so on arrival we asked if we could change it to a king and a lower rollaway bed. They didn't have anything on check in (hardly surprising as we were trying to check in at about 9.30 in the morning, way before check-in time!), but after a conversation with housekeeping upgraded us to an absolutely fabulous suite, which they gave us immediately. The hotel has a great steakhouse restaurant called the Bull & Bear, we tried the hotel bar for food at 10.55 (they close at 11 - we are awkward!) and they accommodated us we some fab snacks and also room service, which was very prompt. and again exceptional. The pool area is tranquil, with a graduated area at one end, which made it safe for our daughter and also great for us to sit and read our books in when it got really hot, they also have bungalows with tv's. If you want to got to any of the parks, there is a free shuttle bus to all of them. The service by the pool, by house-keeping, bell-boys and reception was impeccable and we couldn't fault a thing. We fancied trying breakfast at the Hilton next door one morning and were promptly taken over by golf cart as soon as we asked for directions. The Hilton's pool area is great if you have older children as there is a water slide and a lazy river, they also have a lot of activities going on if you want a bit more action.

The time for these trips is difficult for us to find, and we were very disappointed in our stay. Our visit was from March 25th to March 28th. We chose the Waldorf because we wanted to simply relax and take advantage of the hotel amenities. It is hard to explain, but the vibe of the hotel was awkward. Everyone was trying to be nice, and the luxury suite was absolutely beautiful, but it never felt welcoming. When we first arrived, we were greeted at the check-in counter with \u201cWelcome to the\u2026 (long pause) Waldorf Astoria\u2026 we really appreciate your brand loyalty\u201d. We laughed about this on the way up to our room because she thanked us for being loyal to a brand that we have never visited before, and one which she could barely remember the name of. We didn\u2019t think anything of it until our experiences the rest of the weekend. As I mentioned, our plan for the weekend was to never leave the hotel since it offered all of the amenities we were looking for. I don\u2019t want to write a book, or sound hyper-critical, but here are some of our experiences: - The lobby bar was the epitome of stuffy. We tried it a few times\u2026 one time I received a terrible poor from the bartender who corrected my pronunciation of a scotch (twice), and the second time we were never greeted after sitting there for over 20 minutes. - The pool area was beautiful, but on the first morning we had to listen to loud maintenance workers while shifting from lounge chair to lounge chair as they updated the lights. The following day, when the pool was busy, there was one server for the entire area, and getting a drink was an effort. - When we ordered room service, we were given an exact time the food was going to be delivered, unfortunately it came 25 minutes later and was completely cold. - We were told Sir Harry\u2019s had a nice selection of drinks, but it was never open. - Our dinner at the Bull & Bear steakhouse was mostly pleasant. The service was great, the oysters and the carpaccio were amazing, and I enjoyed my scallops. Unfortunately my wife\u2019s filet that she ordered medium-rare came out medium-well. The server was sympathetic and wanted to replace it, but we wanted to eat together rather than watching each other eat, so she kept it. We also ordered the souffl\u00e9, and were told it would take about 20 minutes to prepare\u2026 it ended up coming out 50-55 minutes later because we were told the first 2 had collapsed as they were being made. The waiter was fully aware and apologetic for the situation, which wasn\u2019t his fault, but never offered to do anything with our bill. The funny thing is that as we were walking out, the manager asked us if we enjoyed everything, and we mentioned that the filet was overcooked, and his reply was shockingly, \u201cyeah, that happens from time to time, have a nice night\u201d. - We really enjoyed the very challenging golf course, but again had a weird experience in the restaurant there. We sat down at a table and were the only ones there. The server, who was seemingly doing side work behind the bar, never came over to greet us. After 15 minutes, I walked over to the bar and grabbed some pastries and coffee which were out. - We ended up walking over to the Hilton, and had somewhat better experiences there, but they also seemed confused and understaffed.

The flowers and the property are absolutely georgious. The location is fantastic and the disney shuttle is very nice. Upon entering the hotel, the lobby is beautiful and exudes luxury.

The pool area was nice and not overly crowded. The steakhouse restaurant is also beautiful and has a private club type feel. The Neutral: The room is acceptable, but not great. On par with other high end hotels, but really not special. To be expected, good bed, good towels, good bath products, but again not great or \"the best ever\". The restaurants are okay, but not special. Certainly not up to the standards set by the Ritz Carlton/JW Marriott Orlando that houses two top end restaurants (Norman's and Primo). They could really use a top level restaurant at this hotel. The Bull & Bear steakhouse was okay (asthetically it is beautiful), but in my opinion the food is not up to the standards of a Ruths' Chris or Flemings Prime, it was good, but not great. Certainly, a step down from Orlando's famous Charley's Steakhouse (maybe they could attract Charley's to take over the space)... The negative: Nobody opened the door for me when I walked in (and a doorman was standing there looking at me). The front desk attendant failed to make me feel welcome and did not provide me with the drink coupons, nor the bottled water that is mentioned on the Hilton Honors website. I visited the gift shop and the attendant did not even say hello, but just looked at me and continued to fold some t-shirts. All in all, the hotel did not remotely exude a home away from home feeling. It actually left me with a \"cold\" feeling. I agree with the earlier comment of \"stay at the Ritz instead\" in Orlando. This hotel is beautiful, but just didn't make me feel like I was special. I believe that at this price level, you should feel like a \"king\".

The treatment rooms were wonderful, however, in the middle of my massage, someone from the outside unlocked and opened the door. Not good. The therapist was very apologetic, and the charge was removed but this should NEVER happen. They really push buying the products which I think is obnoxious. My facial person hovered around the check-out area and again pushed buying the products as she did in the middle of the service. Then, when I checked in, I was assured that I had gotten the upgraded room; when I got up to the room, it was the same standard room that I booked. I was willing to pay the upgraded price, why did they screw this up? The room is lovely and clean, but no mini bar, no coffee maker, no bottled water (obviously, not the Ritz). Room Service was atrocious. No nice touches--no flower, nothing special. My order was pretty basic, burger and fries and a salad. The burger was dry, the salad had brown apples in it.

We could not fault this place and in fact, I didn't want to leave.... The hotel is brand new, having opened for service in October of 2009. Everywhere we went in this place just screamed \"high falootin.\" We got an excellent rate online (we are Florida residents) but it was one of those prepaid deals where you cannot cancel or you lose your money. If I had paid full price I would be even more broke than I am now but even then the lost funds would have been worthwhile. My husband has stayed in the NYC Waldorf and said that while the lobbies were similar in comparison, the overall decor of this one in Orlando and the size/quality of the rooms surpassed the Waldorf in NYC by far. We had one room that was a suite of sorts, with a large king bed and a pull-out sofa, which wasn't used, and that room faced the golf course (room 738). The other room was a standard king room with no sofa, and that room faced the pool (737). There are also Disney view rooms available for an upgrade fee. Every bathroom in this place has both a walk-in shower and a separate tub. The decor, specifically the tiling, in the bathroom was to-die-for. There were Guerlain bath products, lush towels, and a hairdryer nicer than the one I OWN. Turn-down service in the evening was awesome (included in the rate of course). To come back to the room to find the robes and slippers laid out, the bed ready to be slept in, and dark chocolate on your pillow was like something out of a dream. Room service is available 24 hours a day and we took advantage of this on our second night, after having had a bad meal at a restaurant in Downtown Disney. The cost for our room service was comparable to the cost for our meal earlier that night but the quality simply cannot be compared. What I'm saying is that unless you need to leave this hotel for a meal, DO NOT because you may be disappointed. This is Disney so meals will be expensive, and you might as well get good quality when you're paying premium prices. The pool area is amazing. Three pools, ample lounge chairs and cabanas that you can rent. Do yourself a favor and order a bloody mary or two. We questioned whether or not we should rent a cabana (I've been to hotels where you have to leave your room at 5 a.m. just to claim some freaking pool loungers) and were told that it was not necessary, which it wasn't. The hotel was not at capacity and we had no problems finding five seats together at 1 p.m. on a Saturday. Valet is $20 a day but very prompt. There is complimentary bus service to the Disney parks, leaving the hotel every 30 minutes. Everyone on the staff had a can-do attitude. We arrived at the hotel bar pretty late one night and even though they were closing up shop (they close at midnight so bring drinks if you want anything later than that!), the bartender stuck around so we could order a bottle of wine and didn't act huffy when doing so. The decor and ambiance in the bar was unbelievable as well. We ate at Oliver's, the 'daytime' restaurant and the food was outrageously good. Try the french toast. Prices are a tad high in their restaurants but hey, it's the Waldorf and it's located near Disney so we expected that. We also saw a wedding taking place and it looked like something out of a fairytale!

We ended up leaving the hotel on 192 and booking with the Waldorf Astoria. The lady who booked us into the Waldorf Astoria set it all up and we were on our way, and we were amazed by everything this hotel has to offer. Valet Parking was awesome. Whenever we needed our vehicle, we just called Valet, and it was ready to roll, with someone waiting at the door to open it for us. The Bell Service was awesome, with very polite gentlemen taking care of luggage and personal belongings. As we checked out, I asked if he could bring our bags down and store them till we got downstairs, and he said \"Do you have Valet with us? If so, I'll just get your vehicle and load it up\". (EXCELLENT) The rooms... OMG... what an experience. Two robes, and two sets of slippers await you to slide into! The rooms have soft, comfortable beds, with TWO huge comforters on each bed and four huge pillows. The TV is huge with blue ray disc capability off to the side. The bathroom is huge with separate tub and shower. The quietness of the room is excellent considering we had an adjoined room (with guest who we did not know next to us). We have small children, and so did the other guests, but we could barely hear the next door neighbor. We were also across from the ice machine room and we could not hear people moving in and out of that area (whereas with other hotels, one could hear the noise from the ice machine and people coming and going). We used in-room service for some dessert, and ordered the \"CHOCOLATE I.V.\" All I have to say is \"Oh my Lord.... BLESS MY SOUL!\" This dessert is evil and should not be eaten by the faint hearted. The location of this hotel appeals for those visiting ANY Disney Park. It is less than 10 minutes away from Downtown Disney, and just a few blocks away from Disney Hollywood Studios.

Hilton, the owner, knows how to build business hotels, but doesn't know how to built five star hotels to add this extra touch that makes them so special. That lack of 'something more' is apparent throughout the hotel.

This is always nice to have, especially when you have a near-1-year-old. There was no full kitchen (nor did any of the rooms have one that I saw on the website), but it did come with a small refrigerator. It was bigger than I thought it was going to be. It held what we needed, which was milk for baby. The bed was super comfy, as was the SLEEPER SOFA. We pulled it out so my husband and I could watch a movie and he actually ended up sleeping on it while I slept in the room with baby. The mattress is a 3-fold foam. Not your traditional folded up mattress with bars going across your back and legs. They even had a Crib for baby. Not the pack 'n plays that we usually get at other hotels, but an actual crib. I thought this was nice. CLEANLINESS: Very clean - afterall it's only 5 months old. However, my husband did find an old tangerine that must have rolled underneath the TV console unit - after going and searching for our child's toy. Eeew. AIR CONDITIONING: There were 2 separate units. One for the main, living room area and one for the bedroom. I couldn't get EITHER one of these at a comfortable temperature. Every time I set it to go cooler, it was too cold. And when I set it to be a little warmer, it got hot. All I did each time was push the button down and up 2 times for 2 degrees difference. BATHROOM: Very nice, but I've been seen nice. The tub was not that big. I don't have a tub at home, so I indulge in baths when I go on vacation. After laying down, my whole body wouldn't fit; my legs were bent and body not fully immerged in water - and I'm not even tall - 5'4\". From laying in the bathtub, I could see underneath the vanity - and there was a missing piece of tile (a small piece), but it looked like the builders just did have a half-\"butt\" job and didn't bother cutting the right sized tile to fit in the corner. There was a piece of painter's tape up on the ceiling behind the bathroom door - and I think the main center light bulb was out. Or maybe that fixture was there just for decoration - OR - I just couldn't find the light switch to turn it on. SPA: I had the intensive hand AND foot treatment. Form definitely took precedence over function. While benches and tubs where you got your pedicures done LOOKED nice, it wasn't very comfortable. So for a 2-hour treatment, I wish I could have the opportunity to get comfortable. Instead, I came out with a back ache. AND...For the money paid for this treatment, I should have been offered to use the rest of the spa, but I wasn't. GOLF: My husband got an all-you-can golf package for one day, but since it was SO windy and rained on the one day, they let him play again the next. He said the course was very nice. He also described it as \"tight\", meaning a challenge to play.

The front desk folks were helpful and very friendly - but, once we got past the front desk, things weren't so great. Oh, I should mention, the valet parkers were excellent - always timely, friendly, helpful and professional. Examples of mediocre service - After the first night, we needed new, little shampoo/conditioner bottles - these weren't provided automatically, each day as in other luxury hotels - so, I asked a housekeeping attendant in the hallway and she said that she \"would get to it\" (never happened); Also, I asked a coffee/tea attendant who was serving complimentary morning drinks where I could get a tea after he closed his station at 11am and he responded \"not here\" - that was it - no helpful suggestions - there was just a lot of this - not awful service, but not 4 or 5 star quality. Also, I should mention the room - we were upgraded to a huge suite, overlooking the Disney properties - excellent view - the room was very elegant and special - but, the bar/kitchen area was odd - it had a small refrigerator but no mini bar, no microwave, no way to make coffee/tea . . . all it had was a couple of bottles of water and 4 wine glasses in a cupboard. Given that the rate on the suite could go up to $1,400/night, it should be better appointed (in the kitchen area). In sum, the property is very clean, new, bright and promising. The suite we stayed in was near perfect. The valet parkers and front desk employees (including the concierge staff) were excellent. But, the employees who we encountered once we were past the front lobby needed work - their resistance to helping us was inappropriate - especially given that the hotel was barely 1/2 full when we were there. I do recommend this hotel - but, the managers really need to push the staff to deliver a higher level of service (I didn't expect the Ritz or Four Seasons - but, kind, helpful staff members would have been nice).

But, no separate sink or toilet area. No phone in the living room/bar area. My husband wanted to surprise me with breakfast in bed and had to use the phone in the bathroom-which didn't have directory. Very insignificant issues and we only noticed because many of the staff had asked the guests for their comments. We both went to the spa for facials. The spa bed was so comfortable. Finally someone who knows how to design the right shape bed. No back ache after the hour is over! Fantastic and yes expensive but since we're not regular spa goers we didn't mind. Really liked that the Hilton is on the other side of the property and connected via an elegant corridor. We had lunch at the Hilton cafe which was very good. Dinner at Bull and Bear was excellent.

They have more than ample staff available to help with anything you may need. Service--was truely great. The room-was a wonder. They don't miss a beat with the high end fixtures, lovely marble floors, drapery and fine linens. We had both a tub and shower in the very large bathroom and two very comfortable beds. They came in for turn down service daily. The room service was great as well. We ordered it New Years Eve at 11 pm and it was delivered within 30 minutes. They offer a selection of children's items on the room service menu as well. The daily buffet breakfast at Oscar's had a lot of choices. Omeletes, breads, cereals, meats, cheeses, freshly squeezed oj---very complete and tasty. It was $24 per adult and $12 per child. Since there is no where else to eat near by--we ate here every morning. It was great but pricey. We noticed a lot of children around the hotel and the staff was very accomodating to the kids. Event though the hotel is very upscale, there were a lot of families with young children staying there. The shuttle to and from the Disney parks loads up first next door at the Hilton-where there are 1000 rooms--and we were told that on busy days the bus may already be full when it arrives at the Waldorf. We went to Universal and Sea World and the buses do not go to those locations so we took a town car there and a Mears cab back--the ride back in the Mears taxi was always less.

I wanted to take my family to Disney for a week, but there had to be a compromise in that I could get away from the craziness at night. Originally we booked a suite at the Ritz, but my AMEX agent talked me into checking out the Waldorf due to the close proximity to the Magic Kingdom and knowing that my wife and I were going to be toting around a 5 and 2 year old along with strollers and all the other stuff that goes with taking two girls to the parks. I knew going in that we were taking a risk on a new hotel and not having all the kinks worked out, and after reading the first few post on Tripadvisor I was more than a little concerned. I was very close to changing the reservation back to the Ritz, but decided to wing it as I didn't think that it couldn't be that bad. Well within 5 minutes of our arrival all of our concerns disappeared. The Waldorf did not disappoint, while on the outside it is not as aesthetically pleasing as you might expect, the inside is simply stunning. My little girls loved siting and then chasing each other around the clock tower in the lobby and the staff made them feel like they were coming into their very own Cinderella castle. The suite that we were in exsquisitely furnished and the only complaint that I have is that it would be nice if they had more than just a few wine glasses in the bar. We kept fruit, juice, and snack in the fridge and a few plates and some silverware would have been useful. I also did not mind not having a coffee maker in the room, because i enjoyed waking up before the kids and going down to the lobby to read the paper and have some free coffee from the well stocked coffee and tea service. We did Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom during our stay. We utilized the free shuttle service and it was great. You do have to get used to the schedule, but the convenience of it was great. It takes you right from the hotel to the transportation center for MK and right up to the gates at Animal Kingdom. It takes about 25 minutes to get into the MK from the hotel and I would say a good hour to get back from the park to the hotel after the monorail, and the shuttle stops at the other parks. We did get a towncar one night after getting stuck at the Grand Floridian and it was a worthwhile 20 bucks. Next trip we might take the shuttle in the morning and a towncar after the park for the convenience. Overall, as you can probably tell we were thrilled with the hotel.

From the bellstand, to the front desk to housekeeping, to room service\u2026WOW. For just one example, Ryan at the bellstand heard my name in passing, once, when we arrived. The following morning after seeing dozens of people go in and out of the hotel, he still called me by name when I stepped out of the hotel to ask for my car! This was not an isolated incident as all the employees we passed offered a pleasant greeting. Most importantly, when my husband checked in early and went to play golf I asked him on my way to the hotel how check in went\u2026 he said it was the most pleasant check in he\u2019s experienced in years. We were even able to put in a request for an upgrade online (done once you make the original reservation). My husband played the golf course and said it was outstanding. My 10 year old son did not want to leave! He was very impressed with room service.

There are towels and water set up at each machine as well. Very nicely done! Any complaints? Well, maybe just one - - the valet parking is really expensive at $20 a night (the hotel may be named the same as the one in NY but this is FLORIDA). This would be just fine however in order to park your own car you must park in the adjacent Hilton parking garage which is quite a very long walk back, up hill. I wouldn't mind paying valet when my husband and I arrive together but we usually take two cars and I'm not a fan of paying $40 a night for a parking space PLUS tips.

So when I get service and extras, it is just icing on the cake. My wife and I do a Disney weekend every year around Christmas because no one does it better than Disney, it is a great way to get into the holiday spirit, plus it was my wife's birthday. We originally were going to stay at the Grand Cypress, however, changed our reservations when we saw the opening of this hotel, plus I am a Hilton Honors member. I read some of the reviews about the newness, and the inconsistent service that came along with that, but for the price ($239 a night for a Deluxe King Suite with Balcony vs. $400 and up for Disney Resorts), we were willing to try it out. Being a little proactive, I responded to the likely automated e-mail that is sent to your e-mail account a few days prior to your stay. It is from the Front Desk Manager. I responded to him to state concerns about the service I read on some of these posts, and to express how much we were looking forward to staying at the hotel. He was quick to respond to reassure me, and to even offer something special to celebrate my wife's birthday. With his prompt communication I felt good about the weekend. I was not disappointed. The hotel was beautiful, and tastefully decorated for Christmas, and the service throughout the weekend was what I expected and more. Starting with the room, I think it is perfect for a weekend get away, and with a lot of closets and cabinets, it was perfect for our 21 month old to keep her entertained. It doesn't have a coffee maker, but the coffee is free downstairs, so not a big deal. The fridge was just the right size too. If you have to sleep on the sofa bed, don't sweat it, the mattresses they have on them are amazing!! The Deluxe Suite is definitely the way to go, plus we had a great view of the Epcot fireworks. And the TV/Audio in the room was great for watching the SEC Championship game, unfortunately with the Gators losing! Next is food. We ordered room service twice, once for breakfast, and another for a grilled cheese for our daughter while my wife and I went to Bull & Bear (we had a family sitter for our daughter). Starting with the room service, what can I say, it was great, food quality was very good, and the wait time was less than 20 minutes each time. It can be a little pricey, but you are staying at a luxury hotel, so it is to be expected. As for Bull & Bear, what a great restaurant. My wife and I both got the Filets, she got the cognac sauce I got the red wine bernaise, both were very good. They have ala carte sides, and got the Mac & Cheese (I know, at a upscale restaurant!), at the recommendation of the waiter, and we loved it, we also got the mushroom side. We also brought our own bottle of wine and cut cost that way, only getting charged the corking fee. Again, it can get pricey, but we knew that going in, and the quality of food was worth it. Plus, they had a free dessert for my wife's birthday. Location is great, it is about a mile away from Downtown Disney, and very close to the resorts. I agree with a previous poster, it is just far enough away from Disney to feel secluded, which is nice for a change of pace. Also, I was salivating the whole time as their golf course looks AMAZING! Will definitely have to bring the clubs the next time. As for the location of the entrance as some posters have written, I could care less if I am driving through cow fields on my way there, as long as it is spectacular when I am inside and get treated with care. Other amentities that we observed but didn't use were the kids area, with video games, art stations, crayons, etc, very nice and staffed until 5PM, the fitness/gym was awesome, very large area to work out, and the pool both at the WA and the joining Hilton looking very nice but too chilly for this weekend. Also, as for the $20 valet parking, compare it to places like the Dolphin Hotel that charges $12 or $13 a night when you are staying there for self parking, and it is not much of a difference, I'll pay the few extra dollars for them to go get it for me!! Overall, we were very, very pleased with our stay, the weather actually worked in our favor because we got to enjoy the hotel more, as we ended up at the Parks on Sunday.

I know I was giggily when I checked out, and I loved it!!!!", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cThink again..Not what you expect from the name\u201d", "Author": "TheConcorde", "ReviewID": "UR50578451", "Content": "We stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Orlando in November for 14 nights. The first unexpected surprise was the Valet ONLY parking at $20 a day despite the web site failing to mention this fact. Actually the web site was pretty vague about the hotel in general. Not only do you pay $20 to have your car parked whether you like it or not but the service is poor and slow, Valet staff leave mud in the car as they have to run a gauntlet through unfinished areas of the grounds and then work you for tips (this service is provided by AAA and seems to be beyond the hotels control). The hotel is beautiful but they have failed to get finishing touches right and staff in some areas seem to lack customer service training. The room we had been given was facing the Disney parks (1117). On arrival we were surprised to find the room without a fridge despite the fact that the furniture which had been placed in the room had been designed for a fridge to be fitted. After 3 calls to reception a fridge was finally installed. (We were advised that we should have asked for a room with a fridge, not really what you would expect from the Waldorf Astoria and very odd considering the furniture had obviously been ordered with the intension of a fridge to be fitted. Breakfast was taken in Oscars only once. Whilst the quality of food was good the service again was imposing. We were approached by 5 different members of the serving team asking if our food was ok and if we were enjoying our breakfast (we would have enjoyed our breakfast if we had been left in peace for 5 minutes). This was not the effortless service we have previously experienced from the original Waldorf Astoria in New York. My partner decided to make use of the Guerlain Spa area at $30 a day per person (this cost is just for the steam room and Jacuzzi) but he was disappointed to find the steam room was not working and maintenance engineers were trampling through the shower and relaxation area. Hardly the tranquil experience he was expecting and as a result of this and the initial poor handling of his complaint he chose not to make use of the spa and treatments again. Above all else the worst thing about the hotel is the house keeping. They seem to follow no standard when servicing the rooms and its hit and miss as to what is done and more important what isnt. They don't seem to follow the information provided by the hotel advising guests on what to expect from there stay. Information in the room advised that a full change of linen would be carried out every 3 days. This wasn't the case and we had to ask for this to be done. Bath towels ect would be changed if placed in the bath tub like most hotels but this wasn't always the case and we had to poor mouth wash onto bath linen to get the maid to realize we wanted them replacing and not just hung up. Long black hairs were found in the bath after the apparent cleaning and the vanity unit round the sink was not cleaned throughout the stay as when we re packed our toiletries there was dust and dirt marks where they had been. We also had to ask for the room to be vacuumed. These are just the basics of good house keeping and something that really should be addressed. We were also surprised that despite there being 3 of us staying in the room only 2 robes and 2 pairs of slippers were provided for use during our stay. We would have expected this kind of information to be passed to house keeping by the front desk and wouldn't have expected to have to ask a week into our stay. Its disappointing when you choose to splurge on a little luxury for a vacation and find that you could have got better service from a lower grade hotel. I work in the travel industry and spend two thirds of my working year in hotels around the world and really expected better from a hotel with such a heritage. The final straw was being woken by the in room alarm clock at 7 am on a Sunday morning despite non of us even touching the clock radio during our stay. We viewed this as a petty response from house keeping to our complaints. Despite raising these issues early during our stay with the duty manager it is our view that the Waldorf Astoria staff failed to turn the situation around and were slow to respond. Very disappointing and if i were the Manager of the Waldorf Astoria New York I would be concerned for future damage to the brands reputation.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jupiter, FL", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Need to Work Out Kinks\u201d", "Author": "JPinJupiter", "ReviewID": "UR50132728", "Content": "I was attending a weekend conference being hosted at the nearby Gaylord Palms resort and thought that I would combine work and pleasure by bringing my wife and toddler son with me for the weekend. Instead of staying at the conference location, I decided to \"upgrade\" and stay at the recently opened Waldorf Astoria Orlando. We paid about $220 per night. Overall, the Waldof Astoria is a nice hotel, but it's more comparable to a Hyatt than to a Ritz, Four Seasons or even a Peabody or J.W. Marriott. It was not the special experience that your mind conjures up when you think \"Waldorf\". Here is my review: Front Desk: Poor We arrived about 2 hours before check in (had requested early check-in at booking time). When we went to check in, the front desk clerk told us that he had us confirmed for three nights but that our room was not ready and that although it was clean, a supervisor would have to \"check off\" on the room before he could give us keys. We were told that would only take a few minutes and I was asked for my cell phone number. After about 5 minutes, the same clerk came up to me in the lobby, asked me for my name again and repeated that he would contact me. I told the clerk that my wife and I would go to lunch in order to give him some extra time to get our room \"checked off.\" When I went back to the front-desk after lunch an hour later, I was told that the room still hadn't been \"checked off\" by a supervisor. I had to instruct the young man that I had a toddler that needed to take a nap and that we couldn't continue to wait beyond the hour that we had already waited for our room to be \"checked off\". This is unacceptable for a three-star hotel, much less a property billing itself as a five-star hotel (hence, one of the reasons I'm only giving the Waldorf Astoria Orlando three stars). On a separate occassion, I called the front desk and the phone rang 10 times without anyone answering--and nobody ever did. BELL MAN: Excellent Very courteous and friendly. He asked us if we needed any help or information as he brought our bags to our room. On another occassion, I was leaving the hotel early in the morning and asked the bellman on duty if there was a place I could buy a coffee. He said that the restaurants were closed, but that he would get me a cup of coffee. I declined the offer, but I definitely appreciated the offer. VALET: Fair On one occasion I had used the guest services button to call down to have my car brought up. When I got to the front of the hotel, nobody had left to get my car. Another time when I was returning to the hotel, the valet saw the blue ticket on my dashboard and asked me \"Is this one of ours\" to which another valet responded, \"yeah, they changed them over today\". The only time I was addressed by name by a valet was when I was picking up my car at the Gaylord Palms for the conference--and I wasn't even staying there! I also read a review where a reviewer said that she was offered bottled water while waiting for her car. That didn't happen once to me in the three times I picked up my car from the valet. ROOMS: Very Good/Excellent This hotel is brand new. The room had individual reading lamps and HDTV, which were nice. The beds were comfortable and the bed had a beautiful comforter for bedding, although I thought it was a bit heavy and warm for a Florida hotel. The room lamps also had a dimmer switch which I thought was a nice touch. I had a king size room with a view of Disney and could see the fireworks above Disney in the evening. BULL & BEAR RESTAURANT: Execllent My wife, son and I ate in the Bull & Bear. Both the staff and the food were exceptional. We ordered a Caesar Salad as an appetizer and the salad was made table side. Our waiter was attentive without being intrusive and our steaks were cooked to perfection. Whoever trained the restaurant staff should be placed in charge of training the rest of the hotel. I highly recommend this restaurant. POOLS: Very Good The Waldorf pool is designed more for adults, but you also get access to the adjoining Hilton with a \"lazy river pool\" which is great for kids. I wouldn't put the pool in the same category as the J.W. Marriott Orlando lazy river pool as it is shallower and not as well landscaped, but it's very nice. The pool and bar staff is also very friendly and helpful. LOCATION: Excellent The Waldorf Astoria is located next to Disney and is very convenient if you're visiting Disney. GIFT SHOP: Fair I had forgotten my belt and tried to buy a standard black dress belt at the gift shop. However, they didn't carry belts, an item that most hotels catering to buisness travelers would have. It was just a reminder that the hotel is really geared towards Disney tourists. OVERALL RECOMMENDATIONS: -I would set the appropriate price point for this hotel at around $200-250/night. If your room rate is less than $250, you may want to go ahead and book it. However, once you reach the $250/night category, there are far better options in Orlando for the price. -Call ahead to the hotel on the day you're arriving. This should be totally unecessary for a luxury hotel, but given my experience with the front desk, I'd recommend doing so until the kinks get worked out. -If you do decide to stay here, eat at the Bull & Bear. It's one of the highlights of the hotel. -This hotel caters mainly to Disney tourists. If you're traveling solely for business, this hotel may not be for you. Overall, I can't recommend this hotel to a friend because it's not a five star hotel, which is what it purports to be. Maybe the Waldorf Astoria Orlando will get there with some additional staff training and improvement, but for now I think there are better options available.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm City, FL", "Title": "\u201cThis is NO Ritz Carlton!!

The staff is awesome!! Bull and Bear is equally as good but is definetely on the high end price wise. If you are a thrifty type you might want to avoid the Bull and Bear. Ocsars staff was awesome for breakfast and it was good but also very pricey. Breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children with 20% gratuity was $104.00!! $6 for a glass of OJ and $5 per cup of coffee. We went back to La Luce on our last night and it was awesome the second time as well!! Cannot say enough about the staff at this establishment. I may drive there for dinner even if I am at the Ritz! The pool area and landscaping at the Waldorf is sub-par....really dissapointed!! We spent our time at the Hilton pool instead and it was much better.

In addition, the rooms have no coffee makers in them. We called down for hot water and it took about 45 minutes to get it from room service. Then, at breakfast my husband got up to go to the bathroom and when he came back the whole table was cleared. He hadn't finished eating his first plate of food. We visited the spa too and that was way overpriced. The spa had no monthly specials, no Florida resident discounts, nothing. I though the spa was a bit sterile and stark looking with very little in way of amenities. We mentioned the lack of service to the hotel and they told us a manager would call us. It's been over a week and we've had no call. I have to say if your coming to Orlando go for the Ritz or JW Marriott. The hotels have a lot more for kids, families, and couples. The spa at the Ritz is great and is cheaper than the Waldorf. The service at the Ritz is far superior. I was surprised and disappointed. Thought the Waldorf would live up to it's name.

While our vacation didn\u2019t physically begin until the 31st of October, communication with the Waldorf Astoria \u201cprofessionals\u201d began weeks prior. It all started when I joined the Bonnet Creek/Waldorf Group on facebook. In joining the group, I was extremely surprised to see that posts from other members were actually being responded to! I soon began adding my own posts and unbeknownst to me, one post in particular caught the attention of one Vanessa Sain-Dieguez, eCommerce Manager for the Waldorf Astoria Orlando. More about the post and Vanessa shortly. As we neared our arrival date, my husband began receiving correspondence from Joshua Ruck, also part of the Waldorf Astoria group of professionals. Joshua contacted my husband bi-weekly if not weekly inquiring about any special needs/requests my family might have. With each email, Joshua\u2019s determination /commitment to ensure that our family\u2019s first visit to the Waldorf Astoria Orlando would be a memorable one, was genuinely evident and greatly appreciated. The attention Joshua gave to my family in the weeks leading up to our arrival really made us anticipate our stay at the Waldorf Astoria all the more. Pulling up to the breathtaking entrance, the three of us each had our door simultaneously opened by (3) members of the most professional valet team ever encountered. We would like to take this opportunity to thank Rodney, Tara, Edward, Chris and Stewart (as well as the entire Valet staff) for the special attention they gave. Each member of the team daily inquired about the type of day we were having and were always very cordial. We were always offered cold bottles of Fiji water as we waited for the car to be brought around. While my son and I took pictures in front of the stunning clock, my husband checked in and happily informed me that we had been upgraded to a suite! Entering the well appointed two bedroom suite, I knew instantly that my family would never stay at any other hotel while visiting Orlando. As we were being given our tour of the suite, I noticed a little something extra that further solidified my allegiance to the Waldorf\u2026 I have been diagnosed as having OCD. Because of this \u201cailment\u201d I have a love-hate relationship with hotels and I stated this on the Bonnet Creek/Waldorf Astoria facebook page. In the post, I detailed how I clean \u201ceverything\u201d in hotel rooms before my husband and son are allowed to touch anything. I physically clean every item in the room, right down to the light switches! Well Vanessa, the young lady I spoke of earlier, read and responded to my post by providing me with lovely baskets of hand sanitizer, wipes, soap, etc., to use when outside of the Waldorf! I was overcome with emotion to see that she actually took my OCD serious enough to \u201chand write\u201d me a lovely note and provide me with the thoughtful baskets. I was even allowed to attend a morning meeting with the housekeeping staff to see first hand the detail that goes into taking care of the guests and their \u201chomes-away-from home\u201d. I was honored to have been invited. The Waldorf Astoria Orlando is not just a hotel, it\u2019s an Experience; an Experience that you will have to see and partake of firsthand to believe. The plentiful restaurants, the lush grounds and golf courses, along with the resort like setting of the pools aid in making the Waldorf Astoria Orlando truly an unforgettable place. It is obvious that all associated with this phenomenal place have been extensively trained in the area of customer service. Additionally, my family\u2019s numerous trips to the pool were made all the more enjoyable by Michael and his willingness to keep us cool and comfortable on the hottest of days. Michael along with each member of the staff is to be commended for succeeding in helping me overcome my OCD (for the week ;)!

Forgive the long review below but I feel as this is a brand new hotel, it deserves detail so as to help undecided travellers to whom it will be completely unfamiliar - hope helpful! Facade of hotel - as you approach, it all looks big! I wasn't sure about the sky blue colour scheme and still am not - hubby and daughter liked it. As you enter main drive of hotel, agree with other review somewhere that drive past garage of self park is not attractive. However, WAO entrance itself OK - they are working on 2 topiary gardens which will brighten up area as you approach. While we were there, they completed wroughtwork on the outer doors which made it more swanky. Location - thought this couldn't really have been better for us. When you come onto Buena Vista Drive from the Bonnet Creek road from the hotel (1 min drive), I4 easy access immediately on your next right. Typhoon Lagoon, one set of lights away, Boardwalk c. 2 sets of lights, turn off to MK, etc all very handy for Disney. Valets/bell hops - couldn't have been nicer to us. Rush to open doors, chat, offer advice and lets's face it, if they do happen to miss a door once or twice, no big deal surely? Valet is $20 per day - you can self park but you won't! Caddies are available to take you to self park or to the Hilton next door. Bus - never used it but would have if daughter had been amenable to working to a schedule other than her own! Object to the $14 charge for Disney parking, could have saved that by using this complimentary service. Bus looked very swish and empty - valets were pushing the bus service. Lobby and public areas - these were truly classy and fabulous. I feel that some reviewers may have been expecting something more \"obvious\" - however, perusal over the prolonged period we were there showed the tasteful and elegant decor more and more. E.g a walk along the really huge conference facility corridor between both hotels - the carpeting, curtains and lighting in these areas alone were really spectacular. It's quality not quantity and ostentatiousness that counts here - the WOW factor is in the overall atmosphere and discrete quality. There was only one huge painting which I thought was ghastly and not at all tasteful - but hey, probably the most expensive piece there, what do I know? Walk to Hilton definitely seems longer going outside in the heat as opposed to inside via the conference centre. Room - separate room with lounge area/kitchen and separate bedroom with 2 queens. No balcony - I think only 60 rooms in the hotel have balcony, half being central, other half at the end of one block. As a small word of caution, I believe there may be some slight confusion with classification/naming of the room types - between hotel's website/phoning their reservations teams/other travel websites - try to be 100% when booking that all parties are in agreement about what you are booking. Our room itself was lovely - corner unit,12th floor out of 14. In lounge we had 2 picture windows - one onlooking DTD, distant Contemporary and Bay Towers - Epcot ball blocked out Cinderella Castle. Other window had AK, Epcot, MGm - great view of Epcot fireworks. Bedroom, full picture window of pool, golf course and AK, Epcot, MGM. Kitchen area had sink and fridge - coffee maker not to be seen - believe on its way. Had dining table and 4 chairs. Bottled water arrived after first couple of days. DVD player and some kind of high tech sound system in lounge. Bedding in 2 queens beds ranked with the best - superb quality and comfort. 2 nice bathrobes and best hotel slippers ever! Storage facilities adequate as there were several drawers in the lounge area. Ipod docking station with alarm clock in bedroom (did not seem to accomodate Iphone). Bathroom - lovely. Yes, might have been nice to have 2 sinks but there was only the one. Toiletries were Agraria (not familiar with those). Copious towels and facecloths which were of highest standard. I thought was spacious enough. Separate AC in bedroom and lounge area. Newspapers delivered every day (USA Today and WSJ). Not sure what some people expect from a hotel room nowadays - I thought lovely. Finishing of all rooms and fixtures and fittings was of a very high quality. Spa - schedule only allowed for visit to request a price list. Reception area deluxe and fabulous - price list to match!! Manicure $50, pedicure the same - then you are up to well over $100's for various treatments. Pool - hubby enjoyed this every day (I was theme parking mostly). As expert on sun loungers around the world, he declared them top notch! Don't know how to describe them, but no padding, just kind of nylon-y material (though know that is not right terminology, you know what I mean). At all times we were by the pool, we were offered drinks, food. Hubby had water brought without request each day to his lounger. He ate several times by the pool and enjoyed his club sandwiches, etc. The menu changed in the 2 weeks we were there. Pool/bar staff all nice and helpful. There are sun parasols at WAO, not yet at Hilton next door which has the lazy river and water slide pool. Gym - meant to use - ha! Hubby went in for chat with staff - equipment looked fine. I would not think size would be a problem during conference times as there appeared to be more than enough gear to go round. Dining - hmmm. Ate breakfast both at WAO and HBC. First few days at WAO Oscars for breakfast were definitely the \"lowest\" aspect of our stay (however, read on with perspective) - food was fine but they were still finding their feet with the service, e.g. they would bring toast but no butter, jam; hot food with no condiments; hot tea with no milk - you get the picture. You just had to ask though and it was brought. It was obviously teething issues which they recognised and by end of week 1, no problem at all. I did have to laugh though as manager introduced himself on c. day 3 and asked how we were enjoying restaurant - when I responded \"there are a few things we have had to ask for\", I hoped for \"oh, what have those been madam?\" (so he could have gleaned info on what to improve) not \"oh that's fine!\". On our second weekend, they provided a hot and cold buffet which I enjoyed - largely the same as the HBC one I had eaten the previous weekend but $5 more expensive which I thought was a bit cheeky. You can ask for items off the menu if you wish which a number of people did during the week. Menu e.g. $17-18 for 2 eggs with bacon or sausage; $12 for omelette. Apparently you could eat at Oscar's for lunch but I never saw anyone doing so. I did not find the room itself at all attractive but that might just have been my taste - you can eat outside on a terrace. Pool bar food, I have mentioned before. Normal 5 star prices. You can also order food from Oscar's and Bull and Bear (probably pool bar also) and eat in Peacock Alley seating areas. Bull and Bear Steakhouse - ate there once (hubby twice). Thoroughly enjoyed our meals - staff were extremely attentive and well mannered. Would return back. Cheapest steak I believe $36. La Luce - Italian at the Hilton. Was being touted by all staff. We went and as a family gave it 7/10. Starters were fine (and no more than that). Main courses - hubby had pizza which he declared best he had ever eaten, daughter pasta which was good, I had pork chop which was undercooked in areas. As have stomach of iron, ate around and not a problem, these things happen. Pointed out when waiter collected plate, that \"pinker than I liked\" - absolutely no response back. We generally didn't feel it was worth the hype but perhaps we just made wrong choices. Room service - as others have mentioned, no menu in our room initially - though this appeared beginning of week 2 without us asking. Extensive menu choice. We did not use it - though if we had, like all hotels all over the world, we would have expected to wait for it - that's the way of it! Bars - Sir's Harry Bar not yet open though complete - very gentleman's club like. Peacock Alley lobby area bar had lovely staff and was main venue for drink or coffee - carpet might have got a bit scary after too many drinks! 2 tv screens that were placed too high for bar viewing ( my gripe!). Also bar in Bull and Bear you can sit at with tv and have food. We looked at Hilton lobby bar and their trendy bar. Seemed fine. Golf - husband and 2 friends played round. Absolutely loved it - got very reasonably deal and loved the course. Even enjoyed the alligator on the course!!! Clubhouse was beautifully laid out. Sorry - did not check out bar and food options there. First tee is stone's throw from the pool. Shopping - Waldorf shop may as well not be there IMHO. Selling some very nice clothes, handbags, candles and exclusive toiletries with a few Waldorf tee-shirts/polo shirts. Not a newspaper or sweet to be seen. Never say anyone in it the fortnight I was there. Hilton shop on the other hand, stocked all hotel necessities - sweets, chocolates, mags, newspapers, general medicines, crackers, etc, etc. That suits me much better and I can't believe I am in the minority. Staff - all excellent. My other favourite hotel in Orlando is known for fabby customer service - this hotel was no different. We are not \"fussy\" guests at all - I am quite capable of doing a good deal for myself, even when on holiday so perhaps our expectations are lower than some others. I appreciate staff are generally trying to do their best and I also believe that when a hotel opens (even a 5 star one) there will inevitably be some confusion/ missing items/ lack of knowledge. That's why there are reasonably priced deals or you will get comped if there really is a significant service issue. It's glass half full/half empty mentality I think in terms of the service feedback to date. I was generally charmed by the staff and felt if I really needed something, they would help me. There were certainly less hitches that I was expecting given they had only been open 1 week. Worth particular mention (though they were all very nice) - Casey, Jack and Stephanie in Peacock Alley bar, Oskar in Oscar's and Whitney at Front Desk. Pet Policy - being from UK, was somewhat surprised when we saw dogs at hotels (not that usual in our country). Even more surprised when we saw pooch in our corridor in its own baby stroller! Not sure I would like to be in a room where a pet had been previously. Having said that, no issues with barking, poo, etc. Smoking - much contrition etc, but hubby and I smoke. We completely understand and accept that hotels are non-smoking (though apparently you can smoke in WAO if you have a balcony room). However, I believe that they need to improve/increase ashtray locations outside to accomodate those of us that continue to do so where it does not impact others. . Has to be sorted out as people will smoke outside and sadly if there are no ashtrays to hand, some litterbugs will just put out their butts on the ground wherever they are - not us, I hasten to add. Overall - we really loved the relaxed, restful atmosphere of this hotel. Any teething problems could be readily resolved if they were of sufficient need to warrant comment. The staff and grounds were lovely - there may be more wowee pool areas somewhere else but I think you would struggle to complain about the overall package at the moment given the deals that are available. We would absolutely love to go back and it would certainly be our hotel of choice in Orlando, money permitting. I don't think those of you who have been deluxe Disney resort visitors/Ritz Carlton for example could be disappointed in this hotel if you stay in a positive frame of mind and enjoy.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "travelingfamMaryland", "ReviewID": "UR47456677", "Content": "Just got back from three nights at the Waldorf in Orlando.

We look forward to going back again!", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNice\u201d", "Author": "karinli", "ReviewID": "UR47346648", "Content": "We stayed 1 night at the new Waldorf Astoria and were pleased. Although the hotel looks like a hospital from the outside, it is really nice and luxurious on the inside, with nice rooms and bathrooms. Lunch at the Aquamarine was reasonably priced, healthy and delicious. Dinner at Bull & Bear was pricey, but the food was absolutely great, 5* worthy, and the service was perfect. We also played a round of golf, great course, fast greens, and again, great service. There's no minibar in the rooms yet, and room service was a bit slow, but considering that they just opened those are minor things that they'll certainly fix.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Waldorf Astoria Orlando", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d1389861-Reviews-Waldorf_Astoria_Orlando-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$190 - $487*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">14200 Bonnet Creek Resort Lane</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32821</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515833", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/22/4a/d5/waldorf-astoria-orlando.jpg"}}
