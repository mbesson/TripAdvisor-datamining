Check in was very efficient and all the staff I met were friendly and helpful. I normally stay in rather bland 4 star chain hotels so it was nice to be staying somewhere with local character. The public areas were clean, cozy and nicely decorated. There is a lift to the upper floors if you don't feel brave enough to tackle the VERY steep spiral staircase. I would recommend not using the stairs if you have feet larger than a UK size 4 or have drunk any alcohol in the previous 24 hours! You will need 100% attention! You need to know that the rooms vary a lot in terms of size and quality - some are even in a separate building over the road. My room looked nothing like those you'll see on the Hotel website. The rooms on my floor were themed and decorated in what first struck me as a slightly hippy 1970s style. I wasn't too keen when I first saw my room but I have to admit that it grew on my during my stay. If you're a 'glass half full' type of person you'd say that the room has character. The room was a reasonable size with a very high ceiling. I had a view over the nice garden at the back, I think it would be a very good place to relax with a drink in the summer. The shower room / toilet looked like it had recently been modernised. The shower was very powerful and the water lovely and hot. As others have mentioned, the shower screen only covered about half of the shower enclosure which means that no matter how careful you are, the whole of the bathroom floor and the toilet gets wet which isn't ideal. The bed was a little tired but I got a reasonable nights sleep during my stay, partly helped by the very thick curtains that kept the room dark in the morning. The radiators in my room were easy to control and I could change the temperature in the room very quickly. There is free WiFi downstairs and some can get a signal on the second floor - I did which was a nice bonus. Breakfast was a reasonable mix of hot and cold food. At 15 euros though, you may prefer to take a stroll and find a cafe nearby. The hotel is in a quiet street in easy walking distance of local shops, a nice park and several museums and galleries. I walked to the Van Gogh museum one afternoon; took about 15 minutes. There's a tram stop (line 1) about 200m from the hotel. Great for getting back to the central station and some of the main shopping areas on route. Overall, nice stay.

No shower curtain. Every time we showered, the entire bathroom was soaked. A definite inconvenience (this is an understatement) -The mattress was lumpy to the extreme, with humps in the mattress up to 4-6 inches in height, large trough like areas, and ridges that stuck up into one's back during sleep -Internet (wireless from the hotel) was very bad, and this is an understatement. It was mostly non-functional. -We were told the room was the largest, but it was tiny. They lied as I saw other rooms, all of which were slightly larger though still very small and cramped in general. -The staff was mixed-- some were very helpful; others rude, condescending and totally unhelpful. One staff member repeated the mantra \"we are not responsible\" about eight times until I begged her to at least give me an answer to a question. Exasperating -After I was sent (by the hotel manager) to the breakfast room to heat my coffee in the microwave, the head housekeeper came screaming at me across the breakfast room that I cant use the microwave-- in front of all the guests (about 10 of them, eating quietly).

The room price was ridiculous compared to the standard of the hotel. The rooms were badly maintained, everything was on the cheap in them, for instance the toilet paper that looked like something out of a movie about the great depression. The walls and celling stained, the carpet dirty, the windows badly maintained and the TV broken. Stains on the sheeting, dust in the corners, a worn down but big bathroom. The staff, friendly, but clueless. We felt like we were staying at the Fawlty Towers. When checking out we were first confronted with paying (again) for the stay. After some discussion and providing the receipt as evidence the receptionist, coincidentally the same that checked us in, accepted the fact that we actually had payed for the room. Then she claimed that we had not paid the city/tourist tax, witch we had. Again, after a discussion about this and having to provide an copy of the reservation I received by email, she finally accepted this as well. Unbelievable! I have no idea how to run a hotel, but I'm pretty sure I'd do better than the staff at the Filosoof. The only advice I can give others is to stay far, far away from this joke of an establishment.

In essence, there was no place to sit in the room and two bags could not be opened at the same time. The shower had no separation from the rest of the bathroom, causing a flood with every shower. In the evening it took about 5 minutes to get hot water. They supply no shampoo and only liquid soap. the towels are rough. They will rent bikes, which are essential due to the location from the center of the city, but the very kind attendant told us where we should really rent bikes, a 5 minute walk. We did use the hotel bikes one evening, which are dangerous in that they do not have bells, an essential and the brakes were poorly functioning. I walked around through the building: the stairways to the upper floors are a pain. The location is close to the canal stop and tram stop and easy to get to from the airport, and close to the park where the main museums are, but getting into the center of the city really requires biking, not a bad thing if you are comfortable biking through crowds and traffic.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful offering to book tours, restaurants, taxi's etc for us and always enquired about our day/evening when we returned to the hotel at night. The breakfast buffet was delightful, with a great selections of breads, fruits, spreads, cheeses, hams. A great continental breakfast that could beat many other \"good\" hotels (and certainly filled our stomachs for the day ahead.) The general decor of the hotel was amazing and we felt like we were stepping into different eras and cultures with each step we took. Our room was very comfortable overall and the bed was one of the best beds i have slept in at a hotel in a long time, we visited in winter and although it was cold and snowy outside, our room certainly kept us warm and cosy! What was great also, is that this hotel is supporting a Dutch charity that is working overseas in Africa so at the end of my stay i had the opportunity to donate a few euros to a good cause!

Even though we knew each room had a different \"theme\", we expected slight variances in interior decor but the overall impression would reflect the photos on their website - relaxed, comfortable & warm. We were wrong. Based on our experience, Room 30 was themed \"Guilliver's Travels\" - a room fit for six inch Lilliputians. The colonial features and cosiness weren't charming. Instead, it was a history lesson in how the the lower class lived in the 18th century. The sloping attic roof extended into the shower recess which meant showering on your knees but even that was a problem since the recess was literally 2 feet wide. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed in our room and the nail in the coffin was the beeping alarm clock hidden under our bed at 7:30 in the morning! Funny in hindsight. Not so funny at the time, As we had another two nights in Amsterdam, we kindly asked the front desk if we could switch rooms. She was extremely considerate and showed us other rooms that were available. She also organised for our luggage to be placed into our new room (Room 4) which was basic but twice the size of Room 30, clean and reasonably comfortable. Unfortunately, they forgot to give us towels so the attention to detail is slightly lacking at this hotel. Taxis are expensive in Amsterdam, particularly because of the one-way streets and canals in the central area. So if you are not willing to walk or learn the tram system, I would not recommend staying at the hotel. A taxi fare from Dam Square to the hotel is around 15 euro one-way. Getting to the hotel from the airport was very easy. A taxi was 38-40 euros. Otherwise, you can catch the train to Central station for 3.60 euros and then a cab for an additional 20 euros. Would I stay again? Probably not. We paid over 100 euro/night for a cosy room.

The decor has definitely gone from Shabbychic to just plain Shabby. I had a single room which was very small, but the bed! I'm no expert on this, but I suspect you get wider beds in prison. There were a couple of occasions during the night when I nearly feel out. And in case you are wondering, no I am not a large person. On the day I was due to go to a friends' wedding, I did not have any hot water in my room. I reported this in the morning and it was still not fixed by the afternoon. I had the joy of washing my hair in cold water - and spraying myself with lots of perfume! The situation over breakfast is really clever. I had a variety of confirmations, some which indicated breakfast was included, others did not. When I checked in, it was very carefully pointed out to me the times for breakfast - but not that breakfast was not included. 15 euros it cost me for bread and cheese! The last time I paid this much for a breakfast was in a top London hotel which was a full cooked breakfast including smoked salmon. My fault for not checking, but I feel I was led to believe that breakfast was included. Not of course that breakfast was a joyous occasion, the first morning the cleaning staff were vacuuming, which was accompanied by the housekeeper shouting at them - not to stop, you understand, but to continue! The second morning, myself and another woman were sat in a draught as no one could shut the window. And the window in my room developed an alarming leak. Filosoof charges as if it is a top hotel - and it isn't. I have stayed in bed and breakfasts at seaside towns in England at the height of the season, and have enjoyed much better facilities.

However, it was so bad, we had to pack our things and leave after the first night. We had originally booked a DELUXE room. We were given a room which was of good size. However, the bathroom was tiny and did not have either shower cabin or bath tub; there was just a shower pluged on the wall, sending the water directly to the floor. A plastic curtain separated the \"shower\" from the toilet. The bathroom was so small, that taking a shower would make it a lagoon. We asked for a room with a proper bathroom. They showed us various rooms -no wonder why there were so many vacancies- and we ended up in a standard room (EROS room). Again the bathroom was too small, and you could smell the mould, but at least it was properly equiped. In the room, the wall paper was filthy and so was carpet, under which you could feel the holes on the wooden floor. The window did not close properly -we asked for someone to fix it but they didn't.

Whilst we appreciated the quirky ideas put into the room, it felt more like an an after thought than the basis for the design of the hotel. We stayed in a cosy room, which was a small, basic, 'no frills' room with a tiny shower room with toilet. This room is shown on the internet with the french windows opening up into a lovely garden; in reality it smelt damp due to the location being in the cellar and the garden was in need of a gardener. When we first arrived, the room was also very cold, but this improved when we turned the heating up to full blast. The location of the hotel was in a quiet area about a 10 min walk to one of the main eating and shopping areas, we found this a positive aspect of the hotel as it was nice to be outside of the 'craziness' of Amsterdam city centre and you could stroll back via the lovely Vondel Park. Also, the area is well serviced for trams and is close to the museum district. However, our room was not in the same building as the main hotel, since it was in a separate house across the road. The basic-ness of the room's facilities meant we were quite isolated as we had no fridge, or communal area where we could see other people, (also, not that we went to watch TV, but the one in our room was very old and a bit dodgy) and, there was no security.

But we were told to expect that from hotels in Amsterdam, so that wasn't the biggest problem. However, we spent the first night freezing, because a gap had been left in the window overhead.

We spent 2 nights here, and the first night I couldn't sleep ebcause of the cold, and the second night, I didn't sleep because of the nauseating smell of paint! We had no idea what philosopher our room was meant to represent - there was a flaming, golden tulip painted on the wall, and there was a homey, eccentric feel to the decor.

De Filosoof is with no doubt one of the most friendly and unique hotels I have stayed in.

(We had made a booking through an agency for a different hotel and through a mixup of the booking agent, our rooms not only weren't reserved (had been prepaid), but the hotel was full! Luckily, the staff got us rooms at the Hotel de Filosoof which turned out to be our good fortune!) Though there are rooms located in the hotel proper, our rooms were actually located across the narrow street from the hotel and were brand new....all new carpeting, new, modern tiled bathrooms, new mattresses which the staff said were from an ergonomics store...and they were so comfortable! Rooms, at the reasonable rate we paid, can be very small in Amsterdam, but our twin rooms had ample space. The street was very quiet, next to Vondel Park and within a few minutes' walk from the Museumplein; lots of restaurants and the trams on a cross street made the location perfect. The hotel has a nice sized lobby area with comfortable chairs and a bar...we enjoyed a drink and conversation after a busy day of sightseeing! The breakfast room is very nice....several areas in fact in which to have breakfast including a windowed porch. Breakfast was excellent with fruits, cereals, assortments of delicious breads and rolls, eggs, meats, cheeses, coffee, tea, etc. The breakfast staff was very courteous. Also, there is a very nice garden in the back of the hotel proper....various areas to sit with tables and wicker chairs, very quiet and quite lovely. There was a computer on which to check email....very convenient. The staff was truly exceptional - very friendly and kind, giving us tips on transportation, restaurants, etc. They recommended an excellent restaurant in the Jordaan area, Luwte on Leliegracht, a street that is around the corner from the Anne Frank House. We highly recommend this hotel for good value, great staff, comfortable rooms, great location.

The hotel staff went above and beyond the call of duty to help me make transportation arrangements to get to Gent, Belgium. Since I speak no Dutch or Flemish, the female clerk at the front desk spent much time on the phone, then wrote all the information I needed in English, giving me very specific directions so I would not end up on the wrong train, and would not miss the train I had to change to in Antwerp. (Her English was impeccable.) My room was clean, comfortable, and I had no problems with it. I enjoyed all the philosophical quotes and pictures of great philosophers in the hallways, lobby, and my room. The buffet breakfast was fresh and more than adequate. There were many different foods to select from, and the coffee was the very good. My room had a nice view of a church and the hotel courtyard. The internet service was free, a fast connection, and there was no time limit if no one else was waiting to use it. There were enough nice restaurants to walk to in the area - which seemed like a safe and quiet neighborhood. The tram system was easy enough use, and next time I will buy a pass. The walk from the tram stop to the hotel was quick. I did not have nearly enough time in Amsterdam, and would like to go back. I would certainly consider staying in the Hotel de Filosoof again. While it is close to some museums, it was a little too far out from the main part of the bustling city- such as the Dam Square area - for me to want to go back out at night.", "Date": "February 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sandton Hotel de Filosoof", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d196103-Reviews-Sandton_Hotel_de_Filosoof-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$124 - $274*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Anna van den Vondelstraat 6</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1054 GZ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "196103", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e4/01/e401b37f7d721a6a36d359b068d3c2166large.jpg"}}
