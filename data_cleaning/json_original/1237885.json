For over 500 Euros for the easter weekend we didn't think a hello would be too hard. The man and two ladies behind the counter were the rudest we've EVER encountered. There was no way to access the rooms without them buzzing you through. However, they were rarely there and we had to wait for them or find and press the buzzer ourself - great for security! First morning for breakfast the manager did not even talk to anyone - no offers of coffee or tea. Informed prior to arrival am allergic to OJ - that was the only option - couldn't even have water. Our last morning - there was no food left for breakfast - so had to have stale bread with the last 2 pieces of salami. Rooms/bathrooms were fine and big. It is on top of the redlight district. But for the inflated prices you would think customer service would be ok and an easter egg on your plate - no that seemed too much!!

They were very nice and professional during phone conversations and emails before my stay. They were extremely welcoming. I arrived hours before my check in time and they still offered me breakfast and let me wait for my room in their lounge area. Clean towels every morning. I always slept through breakfast so I cannot comment however while waiting for my room on my first day I saw around 10-15 people come down for breakfast and some had seconds so it must be okay. When I was leaving they were still very kind. I did notice that some people got a second visit discount card but I wasn't offered one. The room was nice.. It was very spacious, clean and had a TV. The carpet in the room should be removed and burned. with that in mind, bring slippers or something. Double bed was cosy, nice firm mattress with mattress protector. The bathroom was AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Shower is very powerful and there was always hot water. I took a shower but it was so good I took a bath so I didn't have to get out so soon. Also the bathroom and toilet were very clean. Great location. Close to everything. Overall it is good value for money. I would definitely recommend and come back again. As a female travelling alone it was very safe.

We had a brilliant time in Amsterdam and wanted to leave a balanced review as some of the reviews on here left us petrified about what we would find when we got there! Location - Perfect, you could not get a better location for a fab weekend in the dam IF you plan on drinks, dancing, clubs etc. If you want a sophisticated base for the weekend, then dont stay here. Room - the room was clean with fresh towels everyday, the beds were comfy and our view was right of the canal. Was the room basic, yes it was, did this matter? No not really. If you are out seeing the sights, eating nice food and drinking, you dont see much of the room anyway. Hotel facilities - fine for what we needed. Shower, towels, beds, wifi, breakfast (which again was basic but great to line the stomach) perfect!! Staff - we fund the guy on reception great fun. He has a dry sense of humour, agreed, but one wonders if people think he is rude, they may not have the greatest or varied sense of humour themselves. In all, it was perfect for what we needed.

There was a cigarette butt under the heater and god only knows what else was on the floor. A place that I was not game to take off my shoes.. My husband and I decided that this palce was not for us and decided to leave. Luckily they had free wifi and we looked for another hotel.. We then looked at trip advisor to look at the reviews and in the 4 months since we had booked it, it had gone down he rankings quite dromatically.. We walked down and I checked out within 30 mins of cheching in. If you are looking for a hotel with a brothel feel then this is the place for you.. If you are however looking for a nice hotel to stay at I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you do not come near Hotel 83..

The staff were friendly and helpful, I got in at 3 in the morning only to discover when I went to get into bed that the sheets were filthy and covered in hair, so I went to reception and he changed the bedding straight away. The only downsides are that the stairs are very steep, especially when you've visited the many bars and coffee shops, and the breakfast was disappointing only cereal and cheese and ham and orange juice, not the right food to pull you round from your hangover.

The nearest metro is about 5-10min walk, but we only used this to get to and from airport, the city is compact so getting around on foot/bike is not a problem. very basic but nevertheless breakfast of bread, cheese and some ham along with tea/coffee is provided Good points: The hotel is very basic but clean and the bathroom was newly renovated, friendly and helpful staff, central location, free wi-fi Bad points: steep stairs to get to the reception and then to the rooms, no lifts but i think this is not unique to this hotel.
