The room did not at all meet the descriptions or pictures on the apparently fraudulent website! ROOMS: Apart from being incredibly filthy, they were so tiny that not even a cupboard or nightstand would fit into this \"closet\". There was a bathroom with a \"showering corner\" (no shower curtains or other device keeping you from flooding the floor). Instead of a toilet, we found just a hole in the floor - so do not expect western style facilities! The once transparent fittings were apparently old and disgustingly infested with algae.To complete the picture, we discovered that the bed sheets and carpets were stained. NOISE: Our room was adjacent to the breakfast area, which meant noise from 6 o'clock onwards. Since the room was on the first floor facing the street, there was constant noise from the tram passing by. We had not been warned that construction works were going on right next to the hotel, so we were confronted with unceasing jackhammer noise all night long. BREAKFAST: was quite unappetizing. The table clothes were stained all over, the personnel failed to provide enough plates, cutlery and napkins and the food did not seem very hygienically made up. STAFF: Complaints during the night had not been forwarded since the person on duty was not able to speak English. We asked for a compensation in the form of a reduction of the price after this horrible night but were granted none. After lengthy and tiresome discussions, we were informed in a very aggressive and impolite manner that we would have to pay the full price. We wanted to cancel the second night but were very rudely made aware that the full amount of the booking would be charged to our credit card - but we could leave if we wanted to. We left and we will sort things out with our financial institution. Booking.com - our booking portal - informed us, after we had changed hotels, that the Luxx had claimed that we had never shown up in order to claim all the money - which only emphasises the dishonest way they work. We advise everyone against staying at the Luxx, you will surely regret it! It was the worst hotel experience we ever made.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cGOOD LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "nevin g", "ReviewID": "UR123237066", "Content": "excellent location and excellent personel the room is clean and large", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cThe Luxx Hotel Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Katie133", "ReviewID": "UR98613121", "Content": "The location was excellent .Carpets where filthy.

We reserved a room with a double bed only to find the bed was two twins pushed together. The room was tiny, no room for suitcases nor was their any place to sit except on the bed. Upon entering the room for the first time, the towels were in a wrinkled pile on the bed; Unsure if they were clean. There were dark hairs on the bathroom sink. The location is one of the few positive things about this hotel; However because of the central location it was quite noisy. Finally, the shower did not drain well and we worried it might overflow. I would not recommend this place as there are many comparable hotels in the immediate area for a similar price.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fethiye", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and biggest room ever.........\u201d", "Author": "thebaroness", "ReviewID": "UR81437944", "Content": "We visit Istanbul every year to shop and stay somewhere different every time. We booked a triple room and were given a 4 person one, with one double bed and two single beds that was 60sqm in size - huge. Fridge, tv wardrobes, sofa and chairs. Beds extremely comfortable, room clean. Bathroom clean and functional. Location of this hotel is perfect as you can walk to most attractions or get on a tram from the nearby stops. Breakfast was basic - so we just had that then went out, plenty of places nearby where you can get a toasted sandwich or pastry etc. Despite being in a lively area right on the tramline, we slept with windows open and were not bothered by noise. The room was a corner one on the 7th floor offering views out over the Bosphorus, and into the busy streets. All in all i felt it was good value for money, staff tried hard to please and i would recommend it to fellow travellers.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "THE LUXX", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1799891-Reviews-THE_LUXX-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$64 - $130*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1799891", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4e/b1/4eb1203d0d81b2ad4a6eac29556672e819large.jpg"}}
