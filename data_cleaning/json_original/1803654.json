Instead we were given a triple room for one night. The next day we enquired about our room and we were shown a room that somebody else was still in. We were eventually given our room that afternoon. The lift in the hotel is very very small. We just about managed to fit in with our bags and one member of the hotel staff. We used the stairs for the rest of our stay. I would not want to get trapped in there! Our room was very small. No space for a wardrope so we kept all our clothes in our bags. The windows in the room opened inwards across the bottom of the bed. There was a TV on a very unstable stand which only had foreign channels, therefore we never used the TV and didn't really see the purpose for it. The bed linen was too small for the bed and the bottom sheet didn't fit the matress. Everyday we woke up sleeping on a stained matress. The bathroom was a wet room so everytime we had a shower we had to remove the toilet paper. There was also no window so it took forever to dry. The room had no air conditioner which wasn't a problem for us in October but we imagine in summer it may be a different story! The hotel states it has a hairdryer but when we went to reception to ask for it we were told it was broken. This was a real issue for myself as I have long, thick hair which takes a long time to dry naturally. On the plus side the walls were solid brick so you couldn't hear other people. The maids changed towels, bin and replenished shower gel daily. The hotel offered a continental breakfast for 8TL between 8 - 9.30am but we never had it. There was also a computer in reception to use but again we never used it as there was an internet cafe next door. The location of the hotel is very good. Very close to the Blue Mosque and Spice Bazaar. Also close to a tram line but we never used it. We probably wouldn;t return to the hotel due to the space constraints and lack of hairdryer (which was a big issue for us). But if all the points mentioned above are of no issue for you then I would recommend this hotel for you.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Midlands, UK", "Title": "\u201cLilliput\u201d", "Author": "zwaard", "ReviewID": "UR79932685", "Content": "Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start with the positives. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very close to the railway station and the ferries at Eminonu. And a stroll away from Topkapi. The bed was comfortable. The hot water flowed well. All else is negative. The main problem was the size of the room. It seemed as though they had squeezed a double bed into a <small> single room., Walk through the door and there is a tiny shower/toilet wet room at the side and beyond that the sleeping area. The double bed fitted snugly (ie only just) touching two sides and almost touching the third side of this area. At the side of the bed was a space the length of the bed and 90 cm wide. I make that 1.8 square metres maximum\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. and the limited storage facilities also occupied this space. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all there was for two people. It was not possible for both to get dressed in this space at the same time. The promised air conditioning did not exist; there was a fan. We travel light (flying with carry-on bags only) and we just about managed to stow our bags. How we would have managed with more, I can't imagine. To use the toilet I had to sit sideways and swivel round as there was just about a hand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breadth between the WC and the wall opposite. The breakfast was adequate: bread, butter, olives, boiled egg, pieces of tomato and cucumber, jam, tea or instant coffee. This was taken in the reception and bar area where there are tacky fake(??) black leather chairs. There is no way I would return to this hotel. Well, maybe if you paid me quite a lot.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cClean and good location\u201d", "Author": "gouigouicito", "ReviewID": "UR76062647", "Content": "I paid 32 euros a single without AC.

The shower is not seperate from the rest of the bathroom as westerners are often used to but that was not a big drawback. The location of the hotel was ideal for seeing the old part of Istanbul and very close to the tram stop and fairly close to the ferry docks. We thought of the hotel as a tempory place to rest. We spent 90% of our time exploring the city. This hotel was great for the price and location. The staff were very helpful.
