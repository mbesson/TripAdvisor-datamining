In a city with high hotel costs, this place was a bargain considering the location and relative amount of updates and general cleanliness. If you book this place well in advance you get a very good rate. As much as I would liked to have stayed at the Westin, this place was 172$ cheaper per nite. That is a lot to me! The outside of the building is quite dingy and looks like a prison. However the very very tiny lobby is clean, not fancy but serviceable. The staff working at the check-in counter are quite friendly and helpful. The halls in the hotel are pretty dark leading to the rooms but they are clean. The rooms are clean and simple. There's nothing fancy or upgraded in here, with the exception of a flat screen in the bedroom area. The bathroom is the only part of the room needing serious renovation. It feels old and tired, particularly the countertops. The windows in the room are probably the worst quality of any chain hotel I've ever experienced. The noise level from outside is truly insane. I wish I could give this place 3.5. It's not quite 4 b/c of the bathroom, halls, windows. However it is not a scary place to stay. At the same time, it's not like you're gonna jump up and down with excitement to come back to your comfortable hotel room and want to spread out and relax. So if you're looking for a place to relax on vacation and sleep in late, this may not be the place (however, w/ the hotel prices in YVR, this place may be one of your better choices). I'd say this is a solid step below a Hampton Inn, which may be what the typical Best Western is supposed to be like. If so, it generally meets the standard for what I would expect. The area around is eclectic. Don't be scared away by the multiple sex shops across the street and down the street and across the street (hahaha). The neighborhood is a fun, hipstery kind of area with lots of good pubs. Around the corner on Davie street you have lots of great restaurants and you're in a few minute walk of the Yaletown area. so it's got plenty to offer. Lastly, the pull-out sofa couch was one of the more comfortable of these types of slept on in a long time. While the sheets and comforter were not what I'm used to, they probably are typical of BW.

Karen is wonderful, she welcomed me when I arrived and went through the whole set-up with me and made sure I knew my way around lights and AV to comfortably handle those during the day. She made sure we always had fresh water and coffee and was very approachable when I had a question. She is just a pleasure to work with. Lunch was wonderful and I saw great team work where everyone pitched in to make sure my big group had lunch set-up on time. Loved, loved the food! I had seconds and was tempted to ask for a doggie bag.

We had the security of having our own keys, own bathroom, free internet and clean linen (a big plus). The room was actually three times the size we were used to. We stayed in the rooms across from the main hotel in the courtyard and while the alley way can be a bit daunting and I don't think I'd chance it alone by myself late at night, it is well lit and very close to a door which leads directly to the hotel. As for the area, there are a lot of homeless people and yes a 25c peepshow but that's just the area. We never had any trouble or felt intimidated. There's a good nightlife on Granville St. and the hotel is also very close to the skytrain, only 10 min walk so the location was perfect. The hotel itself was clean, and staff were very friendly. The restaurant downstairs was a little pricey but nice. We only had a problem one night in particular as there was a group of around 25 college kids who acted up in the hallways and kept a lot of people up. It was annoying as I don't think staff did enough to stop them and left them stay again for a further two nights.

The room was clean and large, the decor slightly tired looking, had ample closet/cupboard and drawer space, 2 tvs, a fridge and microwave. No problems with the electronics/appliances/hot water. Can not comment on the wireless internet, as we did not use this feature. The sitting/living room had a couch that pulled out to a bed, (not too comfy to sleep on), a desk and 2 chairs. No complaints from my parents who slept on the beds in the bedroom. Our balcony opened up to a very large, landscaped terrace, but if you walked to the other end of it, you would also walk by all the other rooms that opened onto this space. IMO, a few chairs here would have been nice. Our view consisted of some high-rises, some other old/tired looking buildings that could use sprucing-up and the roof of the building next door, which had a noisy, buzzing generator of some kind. This buzzing noise wasn't noticable from inside the room. In fact, the room was fairly quiet, but every now and then, you could hear some of the loud, raucous party-goers that ventured off of Granville street and into the back ally, just below our room. The rate that we paid for the hotel included secure, underground parking and breakfast. (Deal found on internet). I was expecting a breakfast buffet, but we were given vouchers that entitled us to 2 scrambled eggs, toast, hashbrowns, orange juice and coffee. We're not big eaters, so the portion size more than filled us up. I also wouldn't hesitate to order from the menu, as it had a good variety of items at a reasonable price. In fact, this may be the better option if you are staying for an extended period of time and do not care to be eating the same thing every morning. The front desk staff did not acknowledge nor greet us any of the times that we walked through the lobby, but were friendly and helpful upon check-in/out and when approached with questions. The location of this hotel was good for our needs. Granville Island, B.C. Place, the Casino and Stanley Park were only a 5 minute drive or about a $10.00 cab ride away. Robson St. was 3 blocks away and it was an easy walk to Yale Town. We walked to Robson St. several times and passed by a vast array of places to grab a bite to eat. There were pizza/hamburger joints, convenience stores, trendy bars and elegant looking restaurants. There was also a Chinese restaurant at the corner of Granville and Davie that my brother-in-law recommended. We ate here one night and quite enjoyed it. There were a lot of different items to choose from on the menu at a price that wasn't \"over the top\". Service here was friendly and efficient. The Orpheum theater and Commodore Ballroom were just \"up the street\" and on a few occasions, we kidded my dad about checking out the 25 cent \"peep show\" that was just across the street from the hotel. Granville St. as well as Robson, were always abuzz with people from all walks of life. From the elegantly dressed, to the unfortunate homeless: and everything in between. On the Friday and Saturday evening, Granville street came alive with the late night party/club scene. Part of the street was closed to vehicles and had a number of police and other security present. I questioned this and was told that the increased security and lack of vehicles helped decrease the undesirable behaviour after the bars closed. We ventured out at different times of the day and night, (although not very late), with security present and without, but never did we feel threatened, nor unsafe. So, if you are the type of traveler or business-person, that is looking for a deal, that doesn't mind a room that could use some up-dating in the decor, or a few stains on the carpet this may be the place for you.

As well, the bed was the most comfortable bed we have seen in a hotel in this price range. The only complaint with the room was that it did not have a mini fridge, but we knew that prior to booking the room. We were lucky enought to get a second floor room at the end of the building on the front side, thus the room had four windows (including the bathroom window, which was the largest bathroom window we've ever seen in a hotel). The courtyard had a very comfortable atmosphere, similar to a townhouse neighborhood. As well, it was very well lit so there was no fear of walking back to the room at night, though the alley was not so well lit. But it was only about 30 meters from the secured parking garage to the courtyard gate, so it wasn't too much of a concern. We were glad that we chose the courtyard over the main building, since although we stayed in a hotel, it did not have that type of feeling to it.

Of the four nights I stayed here, I ended up cabbing right to the Courtyard door two of them. - the location is awful; you may be right downtown, but you're on a street that's been under construction so long that half the businesses seem to be either relocated or closed entirely (NOTE: this doesn't apply to porn shops and peep shows, which populate this particular hotel's corner in abundance) - the above construction has extended from the street to the hotel itself, which meant that they couldn't offer any kind of room service - the rooms are small, cramped and dimly-lit, and have absolutely zero personality. Not only do the windows not allow any light in (they're frosted and have wires, just in case you were hoping for a nice institutional feel), they also don't open. - the wireless internet is most definitely not high-speed, unless you haven't been online in about fifteen years. Apart from the very last morning I was there, the max speed for my internet was about 2k/s, which made it virtually useless for anything other than reading e-mails (though getting it to actually open a log-in page was remarkably difficult). - The beds are small and cramped, even for just one person. They call them \"queen-sized\", but there's no way they're bigger than a double. - The cost: way higher than a hotel this lousy has any right to be. All in all, avoid this hotel.

We didn't have time to do as detailed a web search as we normally would do for a vacation, so we were quite pleased with our experience here. This hotel is downtown Vancouver--which is what we were looking for. We wanted the ability to walk the downtown area without having to jump in our car. There is a very tiny parking area where you can park while you check in, but we ended up parking in the street since the parking space was already occupied by a vehicle. Check-in was prompt and courteous. We were in a one-bedroom suite on the 12th floor. The suite was huge! The main bedroom had a king-sized bed, dresser, chair, TV armoire, and two closets. The bathroom was large and contained a hair dryer and all the typical toiletry products. We were shy one set of towels in the bathroom--and they were brought up within five minutes after a call to the front desk. The living area was also huge. There was a nice office space, where we were able to use our laptop through the hotel's free wireless connection. Across from that area was nice large built-in, which housed a large television, a mini-frig, microwave, and coffee and supplies. Also in the living area was a large pull-out sofa, which our daughter slept on. A couple of tables and chair completed the area. Sliding glass doors led out onto a fairly large balcony/deck, with great views of downtown Vancouver. Our bill came to just over $400 for two nights, which included parking in their enclosed parking garage. (The parking was $12 plus tax per night, with daily in & out privledges.) There appeared to be plenty of parking, but the spaces are a bit tight. The hotel faces a couple 24-hour XXX book stores--so I'm not sure if I'd be completely comfortable walking there late at night. During the daytime, however, there really were no problems (just some interesting characters!). The hotel is one street away from many of the more upscale hotels, and just a few blocks from great shopping and dining on Robson street. Perhaps it's because we were way up on the 12th floor, but it wasn't noisy, even though the hotel's on a busy street. We were told that the hotel was built with a lot of concrete--so the floors and walls are solid and extremely quiet . . . no annoying toilet flushing noises from the floor above! We heard absolutely no noise from other hotel guests, which was amazing. There appears to be a lot of construction downtown right now, no doubt in preparation for the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver. I would imagine that this area of downtown could be getting a mini-makeover before then.

Of course, the stylists are tattooed and pierced in various places. Fun to see but you wouldn't want to take them home to momma.
