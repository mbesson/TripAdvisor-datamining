Day one was uneventful, although I agree with a previous reviewer that this property could use an upgrade. Nothing special. Surprising, in fact, due to the good Trip Advisor reviews. At about 11:30 p.m. the second night, we were abruptly awakened by a screaming fire alarm. Somehow the ceiling fire sprinkler went off in a guest room two doors down from our room and across the hall. Water came streaming out of the room and before long, two fire department trucks arrived. By the time the water was cut off, it had streamed down the hall to our room's door. We hurriedly packed the van, sloshed down the hall to check out, and met \"George\" behind the counter. I asked for a refund for the two remaining nights and for check-out documentation. He asked if would like to be moved to a room on the second floor. When I declined, he replied that I would have to contact Hotels.com for a refund, and further, they didn't give check out documentation in this case. After I got home, I called Hotel's.com and have received no satisfactory service from them or Country Inn and Suites Champaign-North. I called Hotels.com and when they failed to work out a compromise, I called \"Penny\" the manager of the property. So I ask you? You are aakened by a fire alarm, two fire trucks, and ambulance, workmen trying to stop water from flooding your room, the smell stinks and I should not be able to check out early for a refund? (By the way, my reservation was not an advance, no changes reservation!) Some service! For those interested, Wingate, right next door, was so much nicer in facilities and staff for the same price.

In fact, so many people were enjoying the pool during our Friday night stay that they ran out of pool towels. The staff was quite accommodating, however, and gave us extra regular bath towels to use instead. Some reviews had mentioned the noisy ac. For us it was just right - enough noise to give us \"white noise\" in order to sleep and an ac which stayed on all night instead of going on and off. Speaking of noise, we were right across from the busy pool, but once we closed our door, we never heard a sound. Must have great noise-reduction insulation in the walls. As if all these thing were not great enough, breakfast this morning impressed me the most. Rarely does one get to eat breakfast at a hotel on real, solid dishes with real, heavy silverware. What a treat! By the way, they also have a later checkout time than most hotels: officially 12 noon, but 1pm was fine we were told.

No running down the halls, slamming doors and talking I found to be bothersome at other hotels closer to the university. Free WI-FI in the rooms. Feather pillows (nice touch). Cons: TV is a bit dated in the room and there is not a large variety of channels. Closet was a bit small (but I made do). The small refrigerator and microwave sat on the floor. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. I was looking for a quiet relaxing hotel far enough away from the \"college scene\" to get a good night sleep and I found it here.

For this trip, we saw that Country Inn had a special offer of 30% off for 3 nights or more. This put the cost of a one bedroom suite at less than a standard room at the neighboring hotel we tried (and liked) last trip - so we thought this was a great chance to try Country Inn. The hotel is well located for travellers as it is quite near to a variety of dining and shopping options and allows easy access to any number of destinations within Champaign - though having grown up there, I do know my way around so may be a bit biased. Check in was quick and easy and the front desk clerk very friendly. We were allocated a one bedroom suite on the ground/first floor right by the elevator. The room was very nice, having a refrigerator was important to us and having a microwave was an added bonus (as far as I know these are only availble in the suites, but have read they can be requested for the standard rooms). The bed was extremely comfortable as was the bedding. The toiletries provided were good quality too. We did use the pool and found it to be generally empty during the day (weekend evenings it was crowded with lots of kids, though). It was very nice overall. Nice buffet breakfast and nice dining room. Very large widescreen television in the breakfast room/lounge with a nice comfy sofa in front of it - we saw people watching various sporting events, etc. there in the evenings. NIce touch. We did have trouble with the free wireless connection - very slow and dropped out a lot, but when I called the front desk to ask about it they offered to give us a cable to plug directly into the connection - this worked perfectly for us and we were very pleased and having a wired rather than wireless connection was not an issue for us, though I suppose that anyone who wanted to use their laptop in the bedroom might. On the 2nd floor there is a coin operated washer and a dryer for guests to use - this was one thing that our last hotel did not have - and a big bonus as we were travelling on from Champaign for a further 10 nights - so really nice to be able to do a load of laundry. The front desk clerk didn't have enough quarters to give me change for the machines, so be sure to have enough with you if this is the case. I got around it by buying a ridiculous number of packs of Big Red gum from the vending machines and getting quarters in change. :) The business center is very handy, though as another reviewer indicated you do have to go to the desk to get a key for the room. If you are a light sleeper or go to bed quite early as we did as we were quite jetlagged, I would recommend requesting a room that is not by the elevators and not between the elevators and the pool. Two of the nights we were there there were a LOT of kids staying in the hotel for various sporting events and they made quite a lot of noise running and yelling in the hallway on the way to or from the pool and the elevator - I mean a LOT. As we had a suite and the bedroom was at the back of the room, we were able to get away from the noise and get to sleep, but I would think that in a standard room without the option of closing the bedroom door it could be quite difficult. We never heard any noise from the rooms on either side of us at all -just from outside the door so I think we were unlucky in where we were placed. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful - I would say moreso than any other hotel we have ever stayed at in Champaign.

BUT the front desk personnel were basically non-existent. When we checked in, there was no one there and no bell to ring. We waited a short time and someone showed up. A short time later, I went to the front desk and again no one was there. I waited several minutes, then went looking around for someone, ANYONE who could help me. I finally yelled \"HELLO!\" towards a open back door and the front desk lady apparently was right in the next room and I startled her. I don't expect the front desk people to just stand there waiting for a customer to show up but if they are in a back room, there needs to be a tv camera to alert them they have a customer or at the very least a bell to ring. A guest shouldn't have to stand there waiting for someone to happen upon them. Then the other gripe I have is their business center. Every hotel I've been to uses the room key to access a business center but the Country Inn and Suites chooses to make this difficult. You have to go to the front desk to get a special key and you must then return the key. This normally would not be such a big problem but then I refer back to the problem of no front desk people....you can't get a key or return a key if nobody is there. And the business center was FREEZING! The one lady who was in there trying to get some work done was wrapped in a blanket. I was just in there to print out boarding passes so just jogged in place to keep warm. But I will clarify that when the front desk people DID show up, they were very pleasant and friendly. One recommendation if you visit Champaign, print out or bring a very good map. I unfortunately booked the Country Inn and Suites thinking it was an airport hotel. Luckily I had a map because there are no signs to the airport and from the hotel it was a slow, stop and go ride and even with the map, I would doubt myself....you drive through the downtown and then find yourself on a dark road that looks like you're in the middle of nowhere and then all of a sudden you see a lighted airport sign....and that's it, you can't see the airport, just the sign.

All served in a cozy breakfast room off the lobby. Wow! Upon check-out, we failed to get our receipt to turn in for business purposes. We called to ask them to mail the receipt to our home address and the always-helpful staff agreed. Once we arrived back home, we received a phone call from the person who took our request. They explained that because we booked through Expedia, they would not be able to follow through with our request, as the rates we contracted through Expedia would not match their rates. It was not suprising to know that the staff went the extra mile ~ again ~ to contact us to say that we would not be getting the receipt and did not want us to be looking for something in the mail that would not be coming. We would definately stay here again, and would highly recommend to other travelers.", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cOur Credit Card Was Used By The Front Desk Clerk To By Rock Tickets!\u201d", "Author": "mikie12", "ReviewID": "UR7246052", "Content": "After a long day driving, we finally arrived at the lodging establishment. I went to check us in, and my spouse got the car parked and unloaded. The motel was clean and the front desk help, friendly. However, regardless of how clean this was we were shocked when we got home and found out that our CC had been used by the front desk clerk to purchase $530 worth of tickets through Ticketmaster. I contacted the motel, the manager said they had fired her, but never once offered to comp us for the night. Apparently they did not check out her history very well, as according to the police she had done this before. However, she had only been employed there for five weeks.

The minute I checked in, the front desk clerk called me about a fax I received and brought it right up. The room was clean, smelled fresh, and had a long hallway because I had a lot of gear. It was perfect because they also put me next to the elevator. I used the pool and Jacuzzi too and both were clean and hardly used. The breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices and friendly staff. I asked them about restaurants in the area and was pleasantly directed to a variety of them with good directions. i would definitely stay there again.Wat a bargain", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oak Park, IL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, Service Oriented, Comfortable Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Chayadina", "ReviewID": "UR6110045", "Content": "Since I began visiting the area for work in July 2006, I stay at the Country Inn and Suites regularly (as well as when we are out of town in Indiana and Wisconsin).
