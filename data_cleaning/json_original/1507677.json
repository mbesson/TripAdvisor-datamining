It took 30-45 minutes to get anywhere each way. There were different shuttle vans with different routes to downtown and MRT stations, but you have to check schedules carefully. After a couple of rides, we opted to take taxi, which cost $40-$60 one way to some attractions downtown, not too bad and much faster. We had an executive level room with some view. The room was very modern, clean, well maintained, and larger than many HK hotels. Service was good, but some did not seem friendly, almost too professional, lacked personal touch, reminded me of some hotel personnel (not the servers nor cleaning ladies) in some hotels in China. The breakfast was surprising good with good variety. You should be able to find something to eat for two or three breakfast. There were only restaurants for local folks in the neighborhood as the hotel is in a residential area. We tried a small restaurant for wonton noodle. It was surprising good and inexpensive, the best wonton noodle we had in HK!!! I assumed it was very authentic and completely local flavor. We ended up buying some dry wonton noodle to take home because we liked it so much! Just remember to bring your own napkins as local restaurants do not provide free napkins!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood value and service.\u201d", "Author": "Brizzy62", "ReviewID": "UR139714562", "Content": "I stayed for 5 days with my three children aged 11-16 years. I found the service to be good. Kenleung on the tour desk was very helpful in suggesting tours to suit my family dynamic and the manager at the front desk was generous when i needed to stay an extra night and upgraded us to a suite at a reasonable rate that included breakfast for the four of us. The breakfast buffet was excellent and catered for all tastes with plenty of food on offer which really helped setting us up for a day of sightseeing. Also had a facial with 25% off for guests. It was so relaxing and really good value. The downsides to my stay were that my son who doesn't swim was not allowed to join us in the pool area if not swimming and was left to sit in the room alone ,very dissappointing. Also the shower over the pool entry was silly and very annoying as when entering the pool you had to pass under the shower and got wet every time. In the room, the bathroom glass sliding door had mould all over it and the shower did not drain properly with water flowing onto floor area. Housekeeping notified and did not seem overly concerned but did clean the glass. The pool bar service was not friendly and the food was terrible and not cheap. The hotel is not close to anything but the regular free hotel shuttle bus makes up for this taking guests to the main shopping district and subway. Overall, happy with stay and would recommend it for those wanting good value for money.

If your are still hesitating, I highly recommend this one. I go to Hong Kong every year, tried a lot of hotels and this one is almost perfect. For this budget, you usually have a very small room in HK, to the point that you ask yourself if normal rooms exist... Well, there you have... I disagree with most travelers who complained about the size, it's enough big, especially when you compare with 90% of the hotels of the same range. The rooms look eastern style, with \"normal\" space (really!), the beds are large and comfortable. The bathroom has real walls (not \"glass walls\"), it has the combo bath/shower, with the choice to fix the shower or not, the shower has a good flow (rare!). The only problem is the location, but this is really a small problem: First, yes, the streets around are ugly... but it's only because the buildings are old (the hotel is an exception), you are in HK, one of the safest city in the world, so don't worry! There are tons of supermarkets & great local restaurants in the area, including the one from the hotel itself that is very good. HK is so interesting that you are not going to spend your stay in the area of the hotel anyway... Second, there is no walking distance to a MTR station. BUT, as you read in almost every other comments, there is a very efficient (free) shuttle bus service from the hotel: every 20 minutes (1 hour of break during meal times), approx. 20 min. of travel to Tsim Sha Tsui. If you are patient, there will be normally a new MTR line in 2018 with a station near the hotel, hem. About the staff, I'm not going to repeat all what you alrdy read: great staff, helpful... The lobby is not as bad as lovetravel006 said: it's big and mainly, there are 6 lifts so that you never wait... The facilities are very good too, I let you be surprised by the quality of the swimming pool. Now, important tips... \u2022 The meeting point of the Shuttle bus in Tsim Sha Tsui is in front of The Penninsula Office Tower Entrance. At the MTR station: follow exit F signs, then take exit L4. \u2022 There is one problem with the shuttle service: it's efficient in july, but you have to fight to have a place in august during the rush hours... In these moments, the drivers have a real hard time: they must fight to stop angry guests when the shuttle is full... It's also off course frustrating for guests who have to wait for the next shuttle. I saw a guest one day who ended up damaging the shuttle with some kicks because he could not have a place after three trials... Mad! There are solutions to this problem, here are three... 1. Take the taxi, it's cheap (apprx. 50 HKD from Tsim Sha Tsui) (the cheapest is from Mong Kok East MTR Station: 30 HKD). 2. The public bus is even cheaper and the number 116 from Quarry Bay has a stop just behind the hotel (approx. 40 minutes from Quarry Bay) (Find more informations about this bus line on Internet). 3. Choose the boat, it's fun! The boat is going from the hotel (I mean from a pier at 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel) to North Point MTR Station in only 20 minutes. Departures every 30 minutes. The only problem: last boat at around 7 AM in North Point (Then take the public bus if you want to come back late). \u2022 FROM THE AIRPORT: Honestly, taxis are so cheap, you should not bother using public transportations... Just take a taxi: expect 40 minutes of driving for only 250 HKD... If you want, before leaving with the taxi, you can already buy the public transportation card at the airport as it will be useful for you during all your stay in HK (you can buy it in a \"7-Eleven\" Shop). This card is called \"Octopus card\" and works like a prepaid card (I usually initially charge it with 200 HKD). When you use the MTR, the fees are automatically charged on your card when you pass the doors. Simple! \u2022 CHANGE: In your country, just make the minimal change for your first day in HK (DO NOT CHANGE ALL YOUR BUDGET IN YOUR COUNTRY; YOU WILL WASTE A LOT!). Then, the best deal is... changing banknotes in a \"Bank of China\" (They ALWAYS have the best rates, do not choose any other bank). Make your change in the city, not at the airport (there is one near the hotel). Finally, quick words about Hong Kong: HK is the safest and most civilized city of China with Beijing... Highly recommended for everything: shopping, sight-seeing, food, leisures... You will enjoy!", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stellenbosch, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cGreat hospitality\u201d", "Author": "xxLeanie", "ReviewID": "UR135992307", "Content": "The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially with arranging tours.

There is nothing in the immediate area of any interest what so ever, it just seems run down and depressing, the closest MTR is a good 15 minute drive away and most taxi drivers didn't know where the hotel is! The hotel has no seating in the lobby except a small cafe, which made it very uncomfortable waiting to meet up with people. It's gimmick is that the lobby is set at an angle of 8 degrees, I didn't really find that too impressive either. The rooms are small, already look a little tired and for some reason the ac made everything feel damp -even the bedding. The room had a sofa and table and tv. I was in a twin bed, I'm 6.3 and know these beds were not made for people my size! Shower was in bath rather than a seperate shower unit. It had an ok restaurant and pool area, and also offers a shuttle bus every 30 minutes to take you to somewhere in HKG that you'd actually like to visit!

However, the Harbour Plaza 8 Degrees (Deluxe Room) is, by far, the worst hotel we've been to - not just in HK, but in any part of the world. Granted, the hotel is new, has a lovely swimming pool, and is located near a 7-11, but the good stuff end here. The moment we entered the room, there was an unpleasant smell. We changed rooms. In the new room, upon looking out the window, we were greeted by an ugly sight of (as one review earlier mentioned) a ghetto-like area. The same night, the bath tub clogged up and our bath water accumulated in the tub. The bedsheets also caused us to break out in rashes every night. All these were still bearable. What really angered us was (1) the one night when we arrived 10 minutes ahead of the scheduled time to catch the shuttle bus back to the hotel, only to see the bus driver drive off, although he obviously saw us waving frantically at him, (2) the fact that we asked for an extension of our check out time from 12pm to 12.30pm only to have our request turned down because the hotel room was apparently booked; at 3.35pm, when I went up to the room to check things out, the lady had only just started cleaning our room, and (3) I was charged HKD240 for the use of WiFi at the hotel lobby, although it was not clearly stated that use of WiFi was chargeable (it was clearly stated that broadband cable in the room was chargeable, but as to the use of wifi in the lobby, it left much room for other interpretations). Sure, every hotel has its fair share of dissatisfied customers, who unfortunately had to bear the brunt of rare cases of hotel non-conformities. We have also had our fair shares of unpleasant experiences at hotels around the world.

Having read this, I downloaded the hotels shuttle schedule from their website (unnecessary as they gave me a copy when I checked in). If you are prepared, there are no real problems.

It is super far from any tourist/shopping area; smack in-front of the hotel is a wet market street selling vegetable, fruits, meat, fish & sundries from morning till afternoon, to the right is a big building dealing in car spares part. Not the most idea spot for a hotel. No MTR nearby, a cab to nearest subway took 20 mins travel time and cost around HK$40-60. The free shuttle is totally useless as it run at 1 hour interval to Hunghom MTR/ Tsimshatsui (opp Kowloon hotel). Most of the time u are not able to board the mini bus as it's full, u need to be 20/30 min standing in the queue in order to be grantee a seat as the hotel is pack with China, Taiwan & Indian tourist. Another free shuttle route is to Kowloon Bay MTR, but this one only run once in the early morning & evening; what a waste as this stop is where Telford plaza is, a huge shopping complex. From Kowloon Bay MTR you could also catch the free shuttle provide by MegaBox shopping mall. Cross the street in front of hotel and on yr left is a money changer whose sign board is so small u miss it most of the time, the egg roll shop next to it is nice, can try. There's a 7-eleven down the street; walk till the end of the wet market street, turn right there's 2 super market (ParknShop & Vanguard), 1 Watson & Manning store. Walk further and there's a few Chinese cafe/restaurant. Hotel lobby is very small and always pack full of people, hotel room size is ok by HK standard. Carpet n bedding are all very clean n new, the bed was comfortable, no stain on carpet; luckily our bathroom comes with a bathtub, those opposite our room (815) don't and the shower area is small. The digital air-con control in the room is great, after some adjustment it operates at the temperature that I prefer so that I could have a good night rest. The only complain I have for the room is that it had too many mirrors, a total of 8 pcs including the one in the bathroom! A strange issue is the mini-bar, it's locked! If u need to use it u got to call front office n they will sent the house keeping staff to open it, than the lady simply remove all item from it! Nothing is left for u to consume even if u are willing to pay for it! There's a plastic tag that say \"complimentary water\" but I never see any bottle water in the room for us. Guys, pls bring yr shaving kit as none is been provided. Ladies, yr body lotion as none is been provided as well. The front office, bell man & housekeeping department is great, courteous with a smiling face always willing to help at all time, that cannot be said for the cafe staff, all have grumpy look, no one ever greet you \u201cGood morning\u201d when u enter for breakfast, that\u2019s including the reception & restaurant manager. This department definitely need to pull-up its sock. One of our tour mate actually lost a tote bag in the cafe when she just left her table for 5 mins, luckily for her it\u2019s not something of value, just a water bottle she bought the day before. :) I would not recommend people to stay here (if u are on free & easy) as it's a far distance to anywhere; even tho the advert say they are in Kowloon City. Transport & the hotel surrounding is a major factor; it's a dead town by 10pm, not a single soul on the road, we only met one couple walking their dog. We walk past a few eateries which are open but there will be a language barrier if u don't speak Cantonese/Mandarin. Not an area for shopping, it\u2019s more residential + auto parts/hardware shop.

Going there, and going anywhere from there will cost you money and time. if you factor that in, it is much better to invest the extra HKD 300 that a daily taxi trip for two from the airport and your (at least once daily) round trip into town will cost you. We had booked a King size bed, and got two single beds, which we had to put together ourselves, since the staff never came to the room to help or to put something on the mattresses to avoid the gap between. We asked for a heater, as it was very cold in HK and the A/C does not have a heating setting. The heater never came. Anything you may want to do means having to go down to the front desk and queue up for 20 minutes, as the staff is not very well trained (although quite friendly). Another thing is that the rooms, however clean and nice, have no view on anything but a highway for the luckiest guests. Bath tubs are quite small. The options for foot or body massage around the hotel are not very appealing (not very clean), and the spa in the hotel is substandard. The reason why we chose this hotel is that the gym seemed very nice. In fact, the equipment is not very good, even by HK hotel standards. Also, the gym is used as an extra ball room, and there was a marriage going on in it on the day we got there. the equipment was moved aside and there were tables set in the middle. Very festive indeed... There would not be any using the gym on that day, of course. The hotel's options for food are limited, not very good and quite expensive. There are no seats in the foyer area, unless you want to have a coffee at the local espresso bar. And this is not good coffee. There is a 7-Eleven nearby, though, but I guess that there is no place in HK sufficiently isolated not to have a convenience store within a 300 feet radius. Finally, the hotel is packed with very noisy and poorly educated tourists from the mainland, who seem to spend their days roaming the corridors shouting obscenities in Chinese (mostly complaining about the service, which is quite amusing). This means that the hotel management must have some agreement with a state-owned travel agency in China.

The hotel is near the airport and they have a shuttle bus to the hotel. I booked online on the hotel website which was easy.

Since my selected room type was not available on check-in, I got upgraded to a suite. The rooms are great, bright and with big windows. Room size is not huge but good for HK. The hotel is new and my room had modern decor (design hotel like), a kitchen in the living room, a small bathroom with a shower and a bedroom. All rooms have TV with international channels and pay-tv. All rooms were nice and clean and the hotel provides complimentary drinking water. Broadband internet is available for about 10 eur per day, which will also allow you to use the WiFi around the public areas of the hotel (as everywhere in HK you have to pay for internet). It did take me a while until I found a power plug around the table in the living room and since there is no WiFi in the rooms you are bound to work at the table where there is the only internet cable in the room. The hotel has a pool area, which is a bit tricky to find but otherwise great if you catch nice weather and have the time for a swim. There's a bar and restaurant near the pool and also a fitness center. Another cafe/restaurant is located on the ground floor. I did however not have breakfast or eat there since you will easily find hundreds of opportunities to eat outside on the streets and around HK. Service was really good. Staff is great, very forthcoming and speaks good English (as anywhere in HK). The concierge service will help you find your way around town, should you want to go shopping or sightseeing. The hotel itself is on the Kowloon peninsula, a bit outside, near the new HK airport and the former Kowloon Walled City but you have good connections with the subway to HK's shopping areas, Tsim Sha Tsui, and Central and a taxi is always around the corner to take you downtown in a few minutes.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam", "Title": "\u201cNew Hotel but location is out of the nowhere\u201d", "Author": "bizarre98", "ReviewID": "UR83882497", "Content": "Nice hotel with plenty of package travellers.

I stayed at the new Harbourplaza 8 Degrees in early February 2010 at the end of my business trip in Asia. This hotel's address is 199 Kowloon City Rd, but if you told any taxi driver the address, they will correct you that the entrance is actually on Mok Cheong Street (pronounced Mook Ch-ong guy) in To Kwa Wan, Kowloon. Relatively, the travel agent prices are similar to their website prices, so I decided to book via their website instead. Rooms: Stayed in the City Deluxe room on the 15th floor and there was a king sized bed, a small sofa, coffee table and a huge desk for working on. Bed was comfortable, 4 pillows, sheets were pretty new, and overall the room looked modern and nice and clean. No funny smell noticed, even though I was on a smoking floor. Everything you would find in an hotel room was there, maybe except an ironing board and an iron. There was also enough open space in the room to do maybe 3 tumble turns on the floor for the claustrophobic person. Had a sneek peak at the normal superior rooms, and they looked modern, but quite small, so it's advisable to get the deluxe room there. Now the bad. Cleaning staff and the person who checks each room after the cleanup should actually look under the sofa and clear out the garbage there, as found some leftover stuff behind the toilet and under sofa. Otherwise, everything was quite clean. Internet was around $120 dollars HKD for 24 hours or you could have booked the room with their 2010 promotion from their website which includes internet, where you save $20-100 HKD bucks a day on Internet. Staff: Excellent staff at the door, the reception, the concierge. I checked in early and a Miss Tsang was helpful and friendly. There is nearly always someone to open the door for you, either the side exit or the main entrance, and always greeted you with a smile. Overall, the all the staff in my mind are excellent and comparable to 5 star hotels in Hong Kong. The restaurant staff at the Cafe were also excellent. Well trained, all smiles. Atmosphere: Hotel looks very good overall, gives out a luxury feeling but the area where the hotel is is a very odd one. Industrial, tons of vehicle repair garages and tons of really really old Hong Kong buildings. I do suggest taking photos of this really old area before they tear it down in the future. In the coming years, this area will become much better as many of the old buildings will be eventually torn down to prepare the whole area to be a tourist attraction when cruiseliner docks are completed at the old Kai Tak airport. Around the hotel, there is nothing much to see or eat..... To get to the famed Kowloon city eateries, you will have to trek maybe 10-15 mins to the otherside. Don't expect much outside the hotel. It's like this modern building next to a whole bunch of old industrial buildings. Other reviewers of this hotel obviously have mentioned that outside likes like an eyesore. Transportation: There are no MTR stations near the hotel. That's the only down side of this hotel. All travels can be down by taxi, free hotel shuttle bus, or the public double decker bus right ouside the hotel. If you are taking the taxi from the hotel to somewhere like ladies market in Mongkok, it is going to cost around 50-70 dollars HKD depending on the traffic. (avoid after work hours). Hotel provides free shuttle bus every hour from morning 8am to 10pm on 3 different routes. One route goes to Telford Plaza at Kowloon Bay MTR (green line), another route goes to the Kowloon Hotel at Tsim Sha Tsui, which you can get to the MTR (red line) and the last stop of this route ends at the Kowloon Airport station for the airport. For example, I took the 2pm shuttle, and after picking and dropping other hotel guests, I was at the Kowloon station at 2:30pm. Convenient. I strongly suggest taking the free shuttle as first, its free.... Shopping and Food: There's absolutely nothing to really shop for where the hotel is located. But I did spot a local laundromat near the hotel where you can do laundry by the pound. There are couple very small resturants nearby the hotel, but cater mainly to locals. There is also a 7-11 store on one corner around 2 mins walk from the hotel where you can buy munchies and smokies late at night. Eating right inside the hotel is also a good choice as the food is quite good. Conclusion: Hotel is pretty good for tourists and area may seem old, but safe. May not be suitable for the business intensive guest as it is too far from all the financial areas. For the adventurer and explorer, its actually quite good. Compared to other hotels, the price is actually quite decent for this class of hotel in Hong Kong, but the location is the main drawback as it is not the most convenient.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious hotel set in old style HK\u201d", "Author": "ALU8", "ReviewID": "UR51267624", "Content": "This new hotel has gorgeous boutique styling.

This hotel is lucky that have some staff like her.She show me a room at 21st floor which is exutive floor but the room was again small I dont like it then she offer me for suit room not upgrated just need to pay aproximitely 300HK$ more I accepted it when I was checkout I saw the price 2370HK$ per night on my invoice normaly must be 1320HK$ I refused to pay this amount they show me contract which was sign when I was checkin. On that contract 1050HK$ was canceled (scratch by pen) then on the right side of canceled price written new price by hand 1320HK$ I sign this one. But when i check out they show me contract 1050HK$ scratc by pen + 1320HK$ under 1050 HK$ total 2370HK$ written by pen I said when I sign it there was just 1320HK$ not pluss 1050HK$ and total 2370HK$ I said can not be like that (I think front desk staff mistake) please find Mrs Judith and ask her she knows very well the story they said Mrs Judith is on vocation can not contact with her on that moment. In the end after many arguing I paid high price they said that will contact with agency on monday if any thing wrong they will correct it They really did it and refound money.It was headach for me. During check out. suit room size is ok but bathroom is too small.
