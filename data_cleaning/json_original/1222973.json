The room was comfortable and spacious, the appliances all worked, and the shower had plenty of hot water. The booking was easy and the check-in was slow and disorganized, but nothing unusual for Bur Dubai hotels. Reception got my wake-up call right the first morning but then forgot to wake me the second morning. Like most hotels in Bur Dubai, the corridors are tiled and as a result, are noisy. The hotel is located on a small, quiet street, so there is very little street noise. The drawback of this is that you have to walk to a main street to find a taxi - not much fun when you are hauling luggage. So, all in all, the hotel is inexpensive and offers comfortable mid-range accommodation. They delivered exactly what they promised on their website.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cGood Deal - Great location\u201d", "Author": "Ericsosa", "ReviewID": "UR124577237", "Content": "Live in Abu Dhabi and go to Dubai for the weekend. This hotel has a great location. We feel we got a great deal considering we have stayed at other hotels in this area and payed more for less. Our room was clean, but there was a weird smell that we did not like. I think it was the cleaning products they use. The one thing I hated was there was no free internet even in the lobby. There should be in this day and age, but we knew that when we booked. While there the staff were good though not very knowledgeable about what is around their hotel. ---*I would recommend this to my friends. * Stay at the hotel and go on a desert safari http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGLO9SevS7s&list=UULENPQ0kK3ndzO0PssTiofA&index=7&feature=plcp We went on this trip and loved it.

It had all the facilities (kitchen, fridge, stove, cutlery, pots, tv, air conditioner,etc), but most of them were dirty (greasy, bad washed, one saucepan smelled like vomit) and we even found a dirty towel in the bathroom when we checked in (it wasn't ours). The staff doesn't bother to be polite, to say hello, to look at you when they're talking, and if you ask them for anything to be repaired (like the oven and the washing machine that weren't working) they reply almost barking. We got a room with one double bed and we needed 2 single ones, so they came to change the beds and the housekeeping guy (who was sweating and smelly), climbed on top of the clean sheets while changing them...we thought twice before using those beds. From our point of view, the hotel could be a good idea with a better management...but meanwhile, find another place to stay, there are plenty in the area", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Room Service\u201d", "Author": "sethi_sakshi", "ReviewID": "UR89398518", "Content": "the hotel is in a very nice location of dubai but lacks a good service. the reception staff is not at all helpful & courteous and the room service was horrible. we had to wait for 2-3 hours after calling the room service for our room to get cleaned.
