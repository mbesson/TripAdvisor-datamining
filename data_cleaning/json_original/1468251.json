This is our second stay at the Element. We are a couple with a child 2 \u00bd years. The tenants before us had not left the previous day and they were expelled in the morning of our arrival. We waited 3 hours to integrate our condo. We were disappointed to find our condo poorly cleaned when we arrived and were forced to redo the whole household to be comfortable. We have not had our welcome basket. Sylvia our maid did not clean our condo the first two weeks of our stay but after Damien superintendent of the situation, she did a good job. Compared to past years where we were at pH 14, there was not a lot of towels and we were only three people. No bath mat, one wash cloth and linen for bedding were stained and withers. We had to buy wine glasses as there were none. No flat plastic or glass leftover food which is not practical when we cook every day. By cons, public areas and grounds are well maintained, we enjoyed the beach monitoring. The past year anyone could use the chairs. This year, the guards made sure that people who used the chairs were many customers Element. Very disappointed maintains the pool compared to last year. Last year the employee who took care of the pool doing a great job. For observing the employee for six weeks this year, it was very bad job. What caused the water to the pool to be quite blurred for a week. Then one day they had to empty the pool with pomes and bring in tanker trucks to fill it! We did not appreciate having ant colonies throughout the kitchen and living room, or cockroaches we found in the laundry room. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, the concierge Damien dedication is greatly appreciated, it offers an efficient service in case of trouble and without him it would be difficult to have such a good service. I still recommend the place especially for families with children as the pool is well suited for them and the private beach. But I give as a three star rating overall.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sault Ste.

I'm a little surprised about a bad review here I just read and am, frankly, skeptical of some things said. In any case, here is my experience. We went with another couple and rented a \"penthouse.\" A penthouse unit includes a rooftop area with your own freestanding hot tub and sitting areas. It is very private and we enjoyed having the extra amenities there. In fact, I watched the sun come up several times with a cup of coffee in the hot tub. The unit was quite nice with two bedrooms and two baths. The kitchen area has a full size fridge, microwave, stove, and everything you would need. A trip to the Mega grocery store and we had snacks and the makings for breakfasts. A dishwasher and washer/dryer for clothes are also in each unit. There is a great balcony and wall to ceiling windows facing the water. There is a road between the hotel and the beach but it is more like a service road. It is not busy at all and quite safe even for kids to cross. It is made of paving stone and not very wide. We didn't really view it being there as a negative. This is not really a hotel. It is a condo property and all the units are privately owned and leased when the owners are not around. So, the furniture and decorating will vary from unit to unit, but I'm guessing they are all pretty nice. When we arrived late on a Friday night, we were given a welcome pack that includes a cellphone that you can use to call the concierge,Damien, at any time. Nice touch. We did call him with a couple questions and met with him the next day. He is very helpful and friendly and usually on property. I'm guessing that not all the condo-owners wish to rent their units so many units were not being used. There is no hustle and bustle that you would experience at a typical hotel and the overall experience is very personal as the help at the front desk quickly knows you and they are also very helpful. There is no in-house bar or restaurant, but there are so many options around you, including your own kitchen, that we did not find that to be a problem. The pool area is beautiful and we found it and the grounds to be well kept. I swam in the pool and found the temperature to be pleasant and the pool clean. The beach is interesting. With the entire width of the hotel, you have a private beach area right in the middle with lounge chairs. It was never busy and there was no problem of people saving seats with towels and that sort of thing. To the left and right of the private area were public beach areas. The one on the left seems to be a staging area for fishing and diving boats. We enjoyed watching the activity over there, but I can see where some people might not. The beach itself is quite nice and the comment someone else made about smell is not accurate. When you walk the beach, as we often did, you occasionally get a whiff of something that smells sulfur-like. You get this everywhere, even in front of the most expensive resorts further down the beach, but it is just an occasional whiff and not something to be concerned about. Speaking of walking on the beach, a 10-15 minute walk takes you down to the busy mega-resorts around Constitution Avenue. It's fun to walk down there, but with the thousands of people on the beach, it makes me appreciate the uncrowded, quiet area that Elements offers. A 5 minute walk down the beach takes you to Origenes Restaurant. This is slightly off the beach and is a great place. It is on Calle 38 and if you walk past the restaurant, it takes you closer to the 5th Avenue area. We found this to be a more desirable walk than directly from Elements. The first couple of blocks from Elements to 5th Avenue is probably safe, but looks a little sketchy and the girls weren't too comfortable with it. Speaking of that issue, cabs are always available from Elements and a quick ride for 50 pesos will have you in the heart of 5th Avenue. That's about $4.50 at current exchange. The rate seems to vary a bit from cab to cab, so it doesn't hurt to ask before you close the doors and take off. We found that if we caught a cab from 5th Avenue back to the hotel and offered 50 pesos, they were generally happy with that. The wireless internet at the hotel did not work for our iPads. Damien recognizes that they have a wifi issue and said it is one of his main goals to get addressed in the coming months. We soon learned that the beach club a few hundred yards away had wifi and went and had a few beers and got the password information. So, I would walk over there once or twice a day to check my email. Speaking of the beach club, it is right next to the public beach I spoke of earlier. It is three levels high with a restaurant and bar service. The food was quite good and you can order food while you sit on a lounge chair taking in the sun with a cocktail. Great place to people watch and the locals like it too. So, we really enjoyed Elements and would go back. Next time I would like to stay longer! This is a great part of the world to vacation and Elements is a very relaxing place to do it.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yakima", "Title": "\u201cBad \"welcome\"\u201d", "Author": "diannelg56", "ReviewID": "UR124920483", "Content": "After viewing hundreds of condo rentals in the Puerto Morelos-Playa del Carmen area, we chose the Elements, as it looked great from the pictures, the reviews were good, and the booking process was easy. Also we felt that the rates were reasonable. I have to say that it is a beautiful building, the way it is designed. But we had a very bad welcome to the place. Being tired after flying all day from Washington State, enduring and ignoring the harassment near the taxi exit at the Cancun airport, we found that it was pouring rain. We had arranged taxi service ahead of time, so that worked out well. But it went downhill from there. This was Saturday evening, the day before the Super Bowl. When we arrived at the Elements, there was only one security guy at the front desk, and he did not speak English. He did have an envelope that had been prepared for us, so first he put those paper bracelets on our wrists, putting my husband's on way too tight, then took us to our condo, #118. He showed us the keys in the envelope and the security codes, then started to leave us there. My husband kept asking him to get another wristband, as his was uncomfortable. It took several charades-type sessions to get the message across. Finally he got the message, left, and returned with a new wristband. So we're standing there, not sure what to do because nothing had been properly explained to us. The envelope had Damien's number on it, but we couldn't get the phone to work. We tried walking to the beach club that we knew was next door, but it was dark and already closed. This was only about 7 or 8 in the evening. Then we tried to get back into the condo via a side door. The security code on the envelope for the side door didn't work. We went around to the front of the building and got a cab downtown to get some dinner. Coming back from town, by the way, a lot of cab drivers have never heard of the Elements, so you have to know the address! Anyway, we get back to the condo and find out there's no hot water! I tried the cell phone again, still didn't work, so I called the \"front desk\" on the phone that was on the kitchen counter. A guy answered in Spanish, I told him #118 no agua caliente, and he told me \"manana\"!!!! So the next morning, Sunday, we couldn't shower, and the cell phone still didn't work. My husband went down to the \"front desk\" (what a joke) and got them to call Damien. He said, oh, the breaker must have tripped, and told my husband where to find it. Sure enough, that was it. Couldn't someone have fixed that right away? We didn't get showers until that afternoon. Finally after another call from my husband, Damien came to the condo to show us some of the things we needed to know. One of the shower drains was plugged, and the kitchen faucet was loose. He did get those things fixed on Monday morning. We felt that the advertising for the place was a little misleading. There was a beach club called the Royal Caribe, I believe, next door, although it seemed to close rather early in the evening. But the \"beach club\" in front of the condo building was nothing more than a square of roped off sand with some lounge chairs on it and a few palm trees. There was no food or drink service. One day I was walking through it to get back to the condo from the beach, and I got stopped by security, which I thought was rude, since I was obviously wearing their wristband. The little street between the \"beach club\" and the condo grounds was always flooded with water. You always had to walk around a big puddle. And cars were allowed to drive and park there, so that kind of ruined the ambiance. The pool was very nice, the first day. As the week wore on the water got more and more murky. Saturday when we left, you couldnt see the bottom anymore and it had a slight green tinge. \"Workers\" (I use that term loosely) were there every morning tending to the pool and lawn, but they spent a lot more time standing around and visiting than doing any actual work. I watched a guy spend 10 minutes mowing the same 10 by 10 foot area of grass. And it wasn't even long enough to mow. I think he was enjoying the \"view\" at the pool. We finally discovered that the only way to get the cell phone to work was to go down on the ground, out of the building. The only way I could get internet service was to hang my Ipad over the railing of our balcony, and that only worked a few times. We tried using the internet in the business center, but that didn't always work either. Very frustrating! One of our last days we mentioned to Damien that the security code for the side doors didn't work, and he said, oh, you're not supposed to use that code! You use the \"beach access\" code! The \"side door\" code was only for 2 private condos! Well, how stupid of us! Why did they even give us that code if it didn't apply to us?? The elevator to our condo quit working halfway into the week, so we started taking the stairs, afraid of getting stuck! The beach was nice, if you don't mind the smell of sewage. And the Royal Caribe had some good food and drink. However, on Thursday, all day long, they played extremely loud techno music, which made it impossible to enjoy any time on our balcony. I believe Thursday was \"ladies night\" but it lasted all day! In spite of all the problems at the hotel, we still did have a lovely time. The weather was actually very good after that rain the first day. We snorkeled in Puerto Morelos, took many trips to 5th Avenue, went to Rio Secreto, and parasailed twice, just off the beach by the condo. By the way, the action of 5th avenue is quite a walk from the hotel, and part of the walk is through a kind of sketchy area. We usually took a cab. I do want to mention that our mad, MariCarmen, was very good. She was so sweet. I didn't understand everything she said but she seemed to understand my very broken Spanish. I don't think I would recommend this place. The condo was nice enough, although the couch in the living room was extremely uncomfortable. But we had such a bad welcome that it soured us on the place. Communication there leaves a lot to be desired. If we return to this area we will definitely stay elsewhere, maybe where the beach doesn't stink.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oliver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe comforts of home.\u201d", "Author": "Satoriguy", "ReviewID": "UR124783995", "Content": "My fianc\u00e9 and I stayed for 4 nights in February 2012.

In Playa del Carmen the waves are not strong so you can actually enjoy the beach.

Back then \"5th avenue\" was only a couple of blocks long. There were three areas of town - Playacar, Playa del Carmen, and del campo. If you wanted to stay in a hotel that was more than a place for beach bums to pass out you had to stay in Playacar. Oh sure, there were some nicer places close to the beach including some cool palapas down by the Blue Parrot (a name that means something totally different today) but Playa was not about luxury. Playa was about the beach, music all night, in a word - tranquillo. Tranquillo not because of opulence but because of the beauty of the air, sun, sand and laid back atmosphere and approach to life. Believe it or not, in the three months I lived there I spent less than a grand. Yesterday, my wife and I returned from a week at The Elements. This condo/hotel is as good as the new Playa has to offer. We stayed in Penthouse 19, a top floor condo with balconies off the living room and the bedrooms. Best of all is the rooftop patio with the hot tub. The view of the ocean from the rooftop is simply the best I have experienced in Playa. Even with all the development going on, there are only a few non-resorts this close to the beach. If you want a view, then The Elements is 5 stars. The Elements is also about luxury and modern refinement. As you can see from the hotel photos (which happen to be accurate), the structure is modern by design with glass, marble, granite everywhere. Think Taj Mahal (India, not Vegas). The furniture is also modern, which is code for spartan. While the furniture is the ultimate in hip, I can't say the couch was the most comfortable or that the bed was terribly soft. These are fairly minor points in my assessment, but when you are shooting as high as The Elements is trying to go, these are the kinds of details that some find important. The outdoor areas are well maintained and refined. The property is gated although the fence is more for definition than safety. The pool has a very unique design. A large portion of the pool is only 6 inches deep, a perfect place to lay in the pool chairs and soak up the sun. During our stay there were several families with smaller children that seemed to use the pool without pause all day and into the evening. It was also a good refuge from the blowing sand and rough surf left over from Alex, the tropical storm turned hurricane. The pool was also very clean, the staff spending several hours each day vacuuming it out and scrubbing it down. I'm more of a fan of Kool Beach Club at Mamitas Beach than sitting at the pool, but the families that stayed poolside certainly seemed to enjoy it. So, the one thing that is not clear from the other descriptions of The Elements is its location. It is not centrally located and is very much isolated. This is not necessarily a criticism but was a bit of a shock for us. This was our third trip to Playa since 2007 and we are very familiar with the town so getting around is no big deal. But if you want to go participate in the tourist tradition of walking down fifth avenue and getting accosted by shop owners who \"want to ask you a question\" and resturanteurs whose \"mother works in the kitchen\" then plan on walking at least 10 to 15 minutes to get to the newer north end of the avenue. If you are going to go get groceries at WalMart or Mega, then taking a cab is mandatory, at least on the way back to the hotel (50 pesos without a tip). While I have never had any safety issues in Playa, I don't think I would have walked back to the hotel at 2 or 3 in the morning if we had gone out to the clubs. While taxis are everywhere, some people have a lower tolerance for this sort of thing. It only takes five minutes to walk to the Oxxo, Mexico's version of QuickTrip or Seven-11, so buying convenience store type things (beer, cigarettes, pork rinds, coca cola) is not a challenge. The Elements has an arrangment with a resturant and you can call the concierge who will order the food for you. The service is quick and the food is very good, especially the breakfast. So the question neither my wife and I have been able to answer yet is whether we would have stayed at The Elements if we knew how far it was from everything. The answer is probably. It's not cheap. The flip side for us was we saved a bunch of money staying in and not partying all night at the disco's. Staying in required us to make a couple of trips to the grocery store for food and Oxxo for beer. The decision comes down to eye candy - the view of the ocean, the architecture, the manicured grounds. If this is what you like, this is the place to be. If you are interested in spending more time going out in the evening/night, look at the other Bric properties like Maya Villa with similar high end finishes. While the ocean view is not comparable, you can stumble back to the room when the fire dance ends. Being away from the crazyness of 5th avenue certainly made this trip much more relaxing than when we have stayed in the middle of things. Finally, Damian is the concierge and he is a wonderful asset. His English is excellent and he tells it like it is. His resturant suggestions were spot on. Also, there is a little Italian resturant two blocks away that is fantastic. The name is something like Pummarola. (Damian can correct me.) It appears less than impressive when you walk by but everything does because you just walked out of The Elements. But the food, service and prices are wonderful and with your first bite you feel as if you have stumbled on a real culinary find. I got the fish filette and had no idea that I would end up with a fantastic mix of clams, muscles, shrimp and fish. An absolutely wonderful meal. So that's the end. Playa del Carmen is not a sleepy fishing village any more. It is becoming more and more luxurious and The Elements is at the top end of this trend. Be prepared to walk but know you will be happy everytime you come back.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Apopka, FL", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "Masarp", "ReviewID": "UR65839422", "Content": "Beautiful location, gorgeous rooms and a huge pool!!

The location was great, with a beautiful view of the water and a two minute walk to the beach club. I don't think I have ever stayed any place so clean. The condos were modern, large and exquisitely furnished. Huge rooms, tiled and glass floor to ceiling showers, dining room, beautiful breezy living room with a quiet patio where we had our coffee every morning. On site massage therapists, a fantastic staff. Great fitness room too. Easy beach walk to downtown Playa, or a 5 min taxi ride. We met some great families, as well as couples. We liked it because it was quiet and relaxed, yet close to everything. I felt very safe and will be bringing my children next time. With the spaciousness of the layout, it was indeed quiet...even though it seemed like the hotel was full. The beach club was my favorite place to eat and hang out, casual yet up-scale.

There is a bar next door Canibal Royal but it is pricey. We had drinks from our room [they even provide a cooler] or wandered south to a beach club if the mood hit. The location is as far north as you can go but nothing is very far in Playa. There are even some restaurants really close by....La Cueva del Chango is a must for breakfast or lunch. There's also 2 italian restaurants close by...Piola and Pummarola. Sadly we couldn't find Pummarola until the last day. Duh. But we enjoyed Piola.

Stephanie with Bric Rental was very nice and quick to help us book our condo. The conciere on duty was very helpful with getting taxi's or helping us find a place to eat. The maid cleaned our unit every day but Sunday when she was off duty. We used USA Transfers for the cab ride from the airport to the hotel. Susan with Latido de Mexico cooked us dinner in our condo one rainy night. It was really nice to have someone cook us dinner so we didn't have to go out in the rain with our daughter. Her mexican cheese dip was delicious! They have a babysitter available if you want a night out. We also got a couples massage on our patio when our daughter was taking a nap, $25 each. We took a taxi to Mega for our groceries. We later discovered a grocery store called Dak, it is a small grocery store and the produce looks better.

After dragging our luggage through 3 feet of snow over our unplowed street at 11:30 PM, reality set in. We had just left paradise. I promised a few people that I would write an honest review of The Elements, so here we go. We arrived to the condo (which is what it really) with no problem. I arranged a transfer with Entertainment Plus, which was $105 USD for roundtrip transportation. They were waiting for us at the airport and we had very nice English speaking drivers both ways. After a pleasant 30-40 minute ride we arrived at The Elements. Damien, the property concierge, was waiting for our arrival at the front desk. I really can\u2019t say enough about him. He is fluent in French (my husband is French), Spanish, and English. We were shown to our condo, which was Penthouse 16. Don\u2019t expect a bellman, The Elements isn\u2019t like that. I\u2019m not saying this in a bad way; someone will help you, for example Damien, a security guard from the condo, or even a guest if you need it. When we got into the apartment, Damien gave us our keys, showed us all of the electronic gadgets, and gave us a phone with his cell number, as well as the number for Bric, the management company already stored in it. He let us know that if there was anything we needed he was there for us. He ended up making all of our dinner reservations and transfer confirmations. As per his advise, every restaurant he recommended was excellent. The building is beautiful. From the time you arrive you feel as if you are standing in front of a modern Mayan structure. The grounds and pool area are immaculate, the caretakers work from sun up to sun down. The condo is huge to say the least (compared to a hotel room). We stayed in the master suite, with a giant bathroom and shower, and our kids shared a second bedroom with 2 full sized beds and used the hall bath with and shower. The d\u00e9cor is modern and sleek, the kitchen was perfect and had almost everything we needed. Views from our place were beautiful. The building is still fairly new and so there is not much wear and tear. There are many units, which haven\u2019t been sold yet, so there haven\u2019t been many guests. We went to the Mega (a local grocery store) to stock up on food for breakfast, lunch and snacks. You will need a few staples like plastic wrap, sugar, napkins, etc. We are not big eaters, which is why we prefer staying in an apartment and not an all-inclusive. We also like to get a feel for where we are staying, which made The Elements the perfect place for us. We were provided with plenty of towels but there is no service at the pool or beach. The maids (off on Sunday) do the laundry every other day and do a great job cleaning the apartment. It was nice having a washer and dryer in the unit. If you are looking for action The Elements isn\u2019t for you. My husband and I spent a week; our kids were with us for 4 nights, our daughter (22) and our son (26). The arrangement was perfect for us because of the 2 bedrooms. The beach and pool are very quiet and relaxing. The Jacuzzi was an excellent way to end a rough day swimming and tanning. We met a few couples from Canada and a family with young children. However, the walk to 5th takes about 5-10 minutes, so you can be in the heart of Playa easily, if you want. Damian arranged to have women who give massages on the patio of one of the vacant garden units, this was one of the highlights of our trip, an hour massage in the warm Mexican breeze for about $25USD/hour. To the left of the condo is an adorable little beach club and restaurants called the Cannibal Royal, with good food, great music and fun for all of us. To the right of the condo is a small fishing house which seems to be a hangout for local fisherman who are very nice and don\u2019t get in your way. Many locals visit the beaches in Playa so you will see a real mix. I must add, that this area of town is seeing a lot of construction, so I imagine that in a few years it will be more crowded. There was talk of getting a concession by the beach or pool to offer drinks and snacks as well as arranging for some umbrellas for the beach. This would be an added convenience, but with the cooler that Damien provided us with, keeping hydrated was not a problem for us! Finally, this is a flip-flop destination; leave your diamonds and Gucci\u2019s at home. If you are looking for a fancy schmancy vacation, The Elements isn\u2019t for you. Playa is a beach town, just like in the states but with an international twist! Just relax and enjoy. We are already planning our next trip!

I just spent a week in PH2 and it was so beautiful down there, and the complex is kept meticulously maintained. The pool man spends 3 hours every day cleaning the pool and the grounds are constantly groomed. Now the private beach club has been made...all the little huts that were there originally are now gone and the sand was sifted with a large sieve so that it is powdery and soft and clean. They are soon going to have comfortable lounge chairs, umbrellas, and maybe some things like kayaks for use by owners as well as guests..paid for by the owners in their monthly condo dues. There is an upscale seafood restaurant close by right on the beach that will be catering food and drinks to the beach club. I can't wait to go back when this is all ready, which sounds like it will be very, very soon! As far as the electricity and power being shut off, I heard that did happen which was inconvenient for the people who were there that week. That was resolved now, and was because the developers saw that minerals were starting to build up in all the pipes in the complex, especially in the pool pipes (water in Playa I guess is very hard). So they spent a lot of extra money installing a special ozone system to purify the water so that sludge would not destroy the pipes in the future. ..which was necessary and a good thing for owners in the long run. So I would add that this looks to be taken care of and was all done by the time we went down a few weeks ago. The place is definitely high class and so well designed and we will go there again because we had a great time! We were informed of this pipe thing while sitting at the pool by some owners who were there, as well as one of the developers who lives right there, so it was from a good source.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Elements", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d1468251-Reviews-Hotel_Elements-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$170 - $312*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avenida Flamingo &amp; Calle 46</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1468251", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cc/cc/ccccc4d77789404e0bdc32218b45616f4large.jpg"}}
