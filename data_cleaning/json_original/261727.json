Reading many of the reviews about London budget hotels, you are aware you are going to get a tiny room. I couldn't imagine such a small bathroom, though. We went there last week (so, February) and it was really worm in the room, which I liked very much, since I'm cold almost all the time :) Room needs a lot of ,,refreshment''-walls had stains, doors and windows are in poor condition, but I must admit it was clean. We got clean towels and soaps every day, bed sheets were clean and so was the bathroom. It is small and old, but it was clean! Breakfast was a great start for the day, a little bit of toast, butter, jam, cerials, juice...I mean-what would you expect for that price?! The best thing about this hotel is location. Very near to Victoria station, from where you have 3 metro lines (Victoria, District and Central) and station of Gatwick express. There are several ok restaurants/pubs, it will keep you full untill you get to know the area. You can even walk to some locations. Noise-I heard a little bit of trains first night, but I was so tired it didn't bother me. If you hear them, that means you didn't walk around London enough! :D I would recommend it for younger travelers and for a good place just to come back at the evening to go to sleep. For that it is really ok, considering the price.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ccheap but adequate for overnight stay\u201d", "Author": "NINOKAZ", "ReviewID": "UR122720759", "Content": "I stay in this hotel when in London on business.

The Dollar to Pound exchange rate is abysmal, so if you are too proud to bunk down in a hostel, be prepared to budget more or you will end up in some place just like this. The room was cramped, like a closet with a bed shoved in, with worn carpeting and an unrelenting musty smell. The private bath is squeezed into what must have been the coat closet, so compact that while sitting on the toilet I could rest one elbow in the sink and the other against the shower wall. We slept fine the first night, being jetlagged from our first day after a transcontinental flight, but the second night was a doozy due to the constant noise from Victoria Station trains running right below our window. On the plus side, this place is an easy walk from Victoria Station.... Do not confuse this hotel with the Alexander House Hotel in Sussex, a 4-star luxury hotel and spa. At the time of my review, the tripadvisor site links to THEIR photo page instead, which is infinitely more glamorous.", "Date": "March 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cBRING BUG SPRAY!!!!\u201d", "Author": "pink_pony", "ReviewID": "UR3452323", "Content": "This hotel ia horid.

I wanted a cheap overnight stopover with full breakfast. As many others have found, the room I booked was not in the building I was shown to (the owner owns 5 or 6 buildings adjoining one another). If they made clear that this was the case and that alternative accomodation i.e. not a specific room in a specific hotel, the feeling of unease might not occur. The single room became a three bed (single and a bunk) room with bathroom. I fortunately wasn't spending much time in the room as it was TINY, dark and very cramped. It also backed onto a railway line that was fairly busy and the rooms are not exactly soundproofed. A basic clour TV, kettle and tea/coffee are available in rooms. The bed linen was clean as was the room although spartan. The full breakfast consisted of fruit cordial, instant coffee, cereal and toast with a selection of jams. Hardly a full breakfast but adequate - why not just say continental as that is closer to the truth?

We booked one nite stay in a double basic room and 4 nites stay in the double en-suite room. I stood in disbelief when I saw the the double basic room. It was right at the top of the bldg. It was so small & cramped. There was not enough space to even put our bags in. The room had been partitioned with wood, therefore we could hear everybody else' conversation & bedroom lambada the whole nite. I thought the nightmare would end when we were to move to the double en-suite room. I was very dissapointed as the room had a double decker bed & a single bed. There was barely enough space to move about. And the room was facing the railway tracks & it gets quite noisy.
