We purposefully selected a room on the canal, anticipating on a holiday weekend there would be some street noise. Not much noise and the joy of having a beer or glass of wine in your room canal-side was just what one dreams about when visiting Holland. All the rooms were beautiful, each one different, expensively appointed and lovely furnishings (ours had a few real antiques). A cozy room with a larger than usual bathroom (which would have benefited from a few towel racks), and plenty of surface space to arrange travel items. As other reviews have noted, the hotel is well-situated for walking access to nearly anywhere you would want to visit in the city. Added bonus: we were induced to walk so much that we both lost weight despite eating several pasta meals at the wonderful Italian restaurant, Ponte Acari, on the nearby corner. Pierre was very helpful, suggesting the best travel routes to museums and dining spots, arranging for taxis, dinner reservations. Narrow stairway added to the charm. Surprise breakfast on our final day provided us with enough food for the next 24 hours. We stayed five nights and would welcome a return. Final note: While the big museums are obvious attractions for hordes of tourists, also consider the Dutch Resistance Museum, a small gem that does a great job of portraying the difficulty of life under Nazi occupation. It's also a lovely amble from the hotel across the Amstel River right near the zoo.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas, United States", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Donald B", "ReviewID": "UR127753562", "Content": "I stayed in canal view 6 -- great view.

Rooom 7 faced the canal, for future visits I think I would choose to save money and face the gardenside because we didn't spend much time in the room. I felt the location was great but I thought the price was high (155 Euros/$190US a night). The room was clean and functioned but cosmetically it was a combination of old & new tile in the bath, an antiquated velour/velvet bedspread, and plain furniture. I have only stayed in one other hotel in Amsterdam so it's hard to say whether this is normal or subpar.

Carrying any more than a weekend bag up those stairs could be a nightmare. My friend and I stayed in Room 4 because it offered the cheapest rates and we didn't have to use the stairs. The room is as pictured on the hotel website. It is about a standard size for most European hotels. It looks out onto a small garden. The mattress is really comfortable and the temperature of the room was comfortable considering the cold February temperatures outside. The bathroom was small and the water pressure a little low, but it was clean. You could occasionally hear other guests in the morning shuffling about. Free wifi is available with directions in the room as to how to access the internet. It is, however, a bit on the slow side, but free internet nonetheless, which I really appreciate when traveling. TV has mostly Dutch channels, but a couple of English stations are available. The staff was friendly, held our bags at both the beginning and end of our stay, offered us outlet adaptors when our Italian plugs didn't fit, suggested dining spots, and called a taxi for us.

Since we experienced two days of torrential rain it was great to have a room where you could actually sit and relax, taking the occasional break from the storm. If this appeals to you it's a great place to stay. One word of advice is that if you're not walkers and most of what you plan to do is on the other end of the canals you may want to find a hotel closer to that area and while you may find something equally charming, my experience is that it will be at a much higher price.

Everything worked, the manager was friendly and took the initiative of calling us in advance to describe the room to us. The only downside was a bed which sloped a bit to the middle. Plus, as in much of central Amsterdam, the stairs are long and not for the faint-hearted; and there is no common area (breakfast is only served in the rooms). But definitely a very good experience.

I was in Amsterdam for a few days attending a trade show before my wife joined me for a quiet weekend away. In view of the glowing reviews and attractive website, I had high expectations upon arrival - all of which were completely exceeded. Booking by email was a breeze, and Mr. Glaner was very patient to answer my many questions about access to the convention centre, nearby restaurants, and such. Upon arriving in Amsterdam, I followed the simple directions I was given and made my way to the hotel by public transit in just a few minutes. My immediate impression upon arriving was 'holy cow!' The hotel is set in the most beautiful street imaginable, right in the heart of Amsterdam's historic canal district. Everywhere you look, the view is right off a post card. Checking is was quick and simple, then I was show the room and given a quick orientation. Room Six is right at the front, overlooking the canal, and the view is absolutely out of this world. The room was absolutely spotless, the furnishings exactly as shown and described, and the only real surprise was how quiet it was when you closed the double-pane window. The hotel advises that rooms overlooking the canal also overlook a street, and can be noisy. I expect it might be difficult to sleep with the windows open in summer, but since I was visiting in November, that was not an issue whatsoever. I slept like a baby and my wife, a notorious light sleeper, had no issues either. We did not partake in the optional room service breakfast each morning, so can't say what that was like. But in every other way, the hotel was simply wonderful. The English leather club chairs in my room were incredibly soft and comfortable, and the bed - one of those chiropractic, memory foam mattresses with matching pillows - proved to be tremendously comfortable. I would go as far as to say it was among the nicer hotel beds I've ever slept in. Housekeeping services each day were great. The hotel does not have a lift, and the stairway is every bit as steep, tight, and winding as described on the hotel website. Not a worry for us, but it's not exactly wheelchair accessible either. The location is awesome, with all sorts of great restaurants, bars, coffee houses, markets and public transit just a short walk.

The owners know what kind of business they're running and they're pretty up front about things. \"Service\" is minimal. Courteous and informative, but if you need lots of assistance, maybe not a good choice. It was perfect for us. Don't get me wrong, the rooms are cleaned spotless and the breakfast is delivered to your room (and is huge!). But you will have to carry your own bags and can't call for room service etc... I loved this hotel. We stayed in 2 different rooms (No 9 up on the top floor/attic and No 5, the garden room). We also spent some time in our friend's room (can't recall No. maybe 7?) When we booked, you could only make reservations directly through their website or on the phone. Initially it looked like we would not be able to stay there but then they were kind enough to let us switch rooms because we really wanted to stay there. I recommend booking early - it's a popular place. The owners also do not allow bookings from large groups to avoid noise and partying. As I said, they make it very clear who's running the ship and this may not be to your liking. We did not mind this attitude as it was never impolite or irrational. All rooms had a lovely and unique atmosphere. Each item in each room was interesting. Whether or not it's to your taste, you can't help but admire the furnishings and the love and care the owners put to decorating. Absolutely a delight! The location is excellent, you can sit and watch the canal, or step outside and walk around. Amsterdam is a lovely place and no better place to stay than on the canal in my opinion! The breakfast is huge - you can easily skip lunch. The website has lots of pictures, although in many cases they do not do justice to the rooms.

This review is a little overdue since my wife and I stayed there last September. Not only did we love Amsterdam but we loved this place. Just looking at some of the pictures today while reading some of the reviews made me homesick to be back there. It is a great location on the canal and as mentioned in many reviews, it is convenient to everything. My wife and I were there for 10 days and walked everywhere we went. We arrived early before check in and were given a place to store our luggage while we did some sight seeing before our room was ready. We stayed in room 9 and loved the view. We did not mind the steep stairs because when we left in the morning, we were gone all day. It was a little noisy on the weekend but earplugs were available in the room and during the rest of the week, noise was not a problem. It is no doubt in my mind that the furnishings were unique because I was certainly impressed. I can't imagine this kind of antiques in most hotels. The breakfasts were great and huge. Breakfast was brought to your room each morning at the time you specified and served on china. I certainly don't require china for breakfast but if one is going to do a review, they should tell it like it is. The Seven Bridges Hotel serves their breakfasts on china! If memory serves me correctly there was a pitcher of coffee (containing serveral cups), orange juice, yogurt, several slices of different types of bread, cheese, lunchmeat, usually two different types of fruit, crouisants and jellies and jams. After eating our fill each morning, we would make sandwiches from the leftovers and have them for lunch as we explored the city. Our hosts offered the options of not having breakfasts some mornings if we chose not to, but it seemed like a good deal to us so we continued them every morning. Rembrandt Square was very convenient with all sorts of bars and restaurants nearby. Yet only a couple of blocks away, we were off the main drag tucked in to our scenic street. One day we were pleasantly surprised to hear music coming from the canal and were treated to a concert by a musician in a little boat. He had a handcranked organ and played a variety of trumpets. After playing several numbers and interacting with those who gathered to listen, he motored off to another location to repeat his performance. What a nice touch, right outside our hotel! Another night, we saw a wedding party arriving by boat and being greeted by guests holding sparklers which reflected off the water. Just a beautiful setting. The staff was very accommodating and I did take advantage of their laptops and internet connections to check my e-mail and communicate with some folks back. When leaving to come home, we walked about two blocks to Rembrand Square and took a tram to Central Station, then, a train to the airport. A very convenient location. I have absolutely no complaints with this hotel and would gladly stay at the Seven Bridges Hotel again. I know they do have some bigger rooms there but we enjoyed number 9 so much, I would be tempted to stay in that one again. Amsterdam has a lot to offer. We found the people to be very friendly. We enjoyed seeing so many people using bicycles to get around especially families with small children in the carts and on various attached seats. The only problem we had with the city was remembering to stay out of the bike paths. Great city. Great hotel.

The hotel location is easy to get to by public transportation and offers you easy access to just about anything you'd want to experience in Amsterdam. From our room, street noise was never a problem and we were always served a delicious breakfast each morning from Gunther or Pierre. And thank goodness for the fridge in our room as we used it to store our leftovers from our huge breakfasts. We did get to peek in at room 5 which seemed to be larger than room 6 with a very nice gargen view, but no canal view. Seemed you couldn't go wrong with either one.

This was our first stop on our European jaunt, and it was absolutely marvelous. You cannot beat this location. Just 2 blocks up from Rembrandtplein, gives you plenty of night life and party options. Also located right next door is Barney's Lounge - an extremely nice and relaxed coffeeshop. You can walk to everywhere, yet it's oddly serene and peaceful for being such a short bit away from party central. We arrived at the hotel shortly after 9am. Pierre was kind enough to have us leave our luggage in their offices until we were ready to come back to check in after 1pm. The hotel is flat out gorgeous. Meticulous, spotless, tasteful and decadent. You are in for a treat just staying in a canal house to begin with, but this one is extra special. The contemporary d\u00c3\u00a9cor and antique furniture is just amazing. After you ring a bell on the outside to be let in through the front door (after checking in, you receive an actual key to the building so you can come and go as you please), there is a long narrow hallway that leads to the back of the building (and I think one or 2 other rooms). Directly to the left of the landing, is the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFront Desk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This is behind a door, which opens up into a small area with a couch, desk and chair, and then further off I could see the private area of the innkeeper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. This is where we stored our luggage. Almost directly past this area on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvisitors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side of this front desk, are the stairs. Now, let me tell you, believe what you read about the stairs. Also please believe what you read on their website where they recommend you stay elsewhere if you have issues with small, spiral, narrow staircases. We loved it! But man are they tight! The name of the young man who transported our luggage to our room while we were out and about during the day escapes me, but let me tell you, better him than me! (Although I was fully prepared. It was quite a chore hauling them back downstairs on checkout day). We winded up 2 flights of these stairs to our room. Opening the door, you are greeted to a very large room. This room serves as your bedroom, sitting room, and breakfast area. Nice high ceilings and crown moldings everywhere. The room was just breathtaking. The bed is sitting up against a floor to ceiling mirrored wall to your right, with end tables on either side. One table housed a flat screen TV and lamp, the other an alarm clock and lamp. On the far side of the bed, is an enormous closet built into the wall. This was spacious and plenty deep for all our stuff. (Although we did keep our suitcases out on the floor.) There is then a fireplace (which is not usable), and then 2 lovely chairs and a very nice large table. These sit against windows, opposite the bed, looking out at the spectacular canal, bridge and street. In the corner is a very nice antique \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which actually houses a small mini-fridge! Ingenious design. There were fantastic fresh flowers on the table for us as well. On the same side as the door to our room, is a separate door leading to the bathroom. Nicely tiled in blue and white, this was a very spacious area. Shower (no tub), sink and toilet. Plenty of room for all our bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaccessories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Exquisitely decorated, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t begin to describe the types of furnishings, although they do leave little notes in the closet about the time period and origin of some of the pieces. Which I thought was so much fun. The bed was fantastically comfortable and we had no trouble sleeping. Although at night it can be a little loud with the spillover from Rembrandt Square partying come to an end around 3am. So bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Pierre delivered breakfast to our room each morning (at a pre-determined time which you and he will select). Beautiful china and flatware. Made it a joy to pour our coffee from the porcelain carafe each morning. The food was wonderful and plenty of it. Each and every morning, we had packed up the EXTRA rolls and cheese to snack on later that night before bed. Yogurt, different breads and croissants, meats, cheeses, OJ and coffee (or tea, you let them know beforehand which you want). You will not be hungry afterwards. Trust me. The other staff we encountered during our stay were all fabulous and friendly. Pierre helped us with shortcuts and directions, and was always smiling and happy to see us come down each morning on our way out for the day. They allowed us to peek into the Garden room one morning as they were cleaning it, and it was even more spectacular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a step up into a gorgeous little private garden area. Lots of rain ensures there is always plenty in bloom. It was terrific. Free wifi as well, so we stayed connected with family back home each night.

Furthest sites are maybe 25 mins away walking (Centraal station and Anne Frank House) On days we were feeling lazy we caught the tram (located 2 streets over) to our destined site. Tram cost is 2,60 Euro per person for a 1 time ride. The room was gorgeous with a canal view and was located up one flight of truly steep stairs from the main lobby area. We were totally intimidated by these stairs at first but you do get used to them and the proprietors did help us with our luggage. A comfortable queen sized bed with nice pillows and bedding was a true treat as well as the lovely antique marble table and leather chars we sat at each morning in front of the windows to enjoy our breakfast. Bathroom was equipped with a nice sized shower and was not cramped at all. Good water pressure, clean, and bright, and nice towels, too! We did not really hear any noise at all from the other guests or the street although it is a fairly well used street given its proximity to the Rembrandt square. I would not give this a second thought when considering this hotel because unless you are the world's lightest sleeper you will sleep like a baby. Closet shelving is a bit narrow but lots of shelves to use and also a rod to hang clothes was available. Closets were lockable with lovely old fashioned keys and though the room did not have a safe we felt comfortable leaving valuables locked in the closet or in the hotel safe located with the proprietors. The breakfast. Oh my. The best part of our experience, I'd say. Delivered to our room each morning at 8 AM (you can select the delivery time when you check in) on a tray loaded with 2 croissants, 2 different types of bread, scones or coffee cake, sliced meats and cheese,oranges, bananas, or sometimes apples, fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee or tea, yogurt and a variety of jams. Presentation was on china, a different pattern each day, and absolutely lovely. The breads were warm and fresh, fruit was ripe and the coffee strong and delicious. We felt like we were feasting each morning. Due to the size of this breakfast we did not need to eat again until dinner, which we usually had around 9 PM at one of the restaurants in the Rembrandtplein. Our room was 150 Euros per night including breakfast which I feel was a great deal and on the one day we did not take breakfast, which we advised them of in advance, they deducted the cost of breakfast from our nightly rate (20 euros).

As such, it is about 20 minutes walk along the beautiful canals to places of interest such a s rijksmuseum as well as van gogh museum. Many other places of interest are also within walking distance such as the hash museum and the RLD. We walked practically everywhere and did not avail ourselves to the public transport but seeing the many trams lines that we crossed about a mere 3-5 minutes walk away, you shouldn't be too far from access. We requested for the canal view room 7 which was gorgeously decorated with period furniture. Little did we realise that the arm chairs we were sitting on were 17th century antiques! Room was a bit on the small side but adequate (considering that this is Europe afterall). toilets and bath are adequate and spotless in cleanliness.

View from the room is gorgeous and despite facing the road in front, the little human and vehicular traffic is fairly well insulated and we were not bothered by traffic noises or noises from late night revelers. This room is reached by a tiny and steep circular fire-escape like stairs. can be difficult to maneuver if you have large and heavy luggage which we did. But the owners were around to give a helping hand. Breakfast is served daily by the owners themselves. you can request for it at a pre-determined time which is useful if you need a lie in after a heavy night. Breakfast is served on nice china-ware from the likes of villeroy and boch. Includes croissont, scones and sliced bread, yoggurt, cold cuts and cheese and fruits. choice of tea of coffee is available. We asked for Earl Grey tea and although they said they don;t have it , they still serve it to us on the first morning! also included is a 20 inch flat screen TV which includes many channels including CNN and BBC world. Internet is Free of charge and fairly stable over wifi. In summary, we will strongly recommend this hotel to those seeking a unique place to stay in a wonderful city. Afterall, when was the last time you sleep in a room decorated with bona fide antiques with all the mod cons too?", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cfinding the needle in the haystack - one of a kind in amsterdam...\u201d", "Author": "Villavillerkulla", "ReviewID": "UR35544881", "Content": "Amsterdam is a favourite place of mine... and to stay at a hotel like Seven Bridges was like finding the needle in the haystack.

A few things to bear in mind, if you are going to stay there. There is not really a lobby, just an entrance hall. So if you picture yourself sitting around the lobby visiting with the other residents, you would be disappointed.

It looked good at the internet site, but in real life it looks even better. The location of the hotel is probably the best in Amsterdam, at a picturesque crossing of two canals (check out their site, www.sevenbridgeshotel.nl), 200 meters from the busy district. So you have the advantage of staying in a beautiful, quiet residential neighborhood, whereas at any time it takes you 3 minutes to reach the lively, busy city center. It takes less than 30 minutes of walking to reach any other place of interest or 5 minutes in the tram (there is a station nearby). Interestingly, there were hardly any tourists although the weather was not too bad (a little bit of drizzle, temperatures in the range of 6-15 Celsius) so it seems like a good season to tour Amsterdam. We stayed in room C. The room is magnificent (again, just look at the site but the pictures underestimate). You enter a 17th century house and climb a surprisingly steep staircase into a rather spacious room, which includes a living room with a view of the canal and the bridge, a bedroom, and a bathroom. Everything is furnished in great taste with beautiful antique furniture and the organization is very comfortable. It is evident that someone really thought about every detail. The staff is extremely friendly, attentive and helpful. We are not very well organized so we booked the hotel at the last minute.

The little touches were wonderful - they gave us stamps rather than sending us to the post office, and there was always a friendly face to greet us - plus we had our own key so there was no buzzing to wake someone at night to let you in.

Within about two blocks, you can find anything you need, from restaurants, to tram stops, to coffeeshops. It's especially nice for first-time visitors who will be roaming all over the city and need a centrally-located home base that's easy to get to from any of the main sights. The owners are very sweet and attentive. The complimentary breakfast (brought up to your room!) is wonderful, with juice, coffee, tea, meat, cheese, fruit, yogurt, and a variety of breads. We could never finish the whole thing, so we usually saved the bananas for eating while out exploring later in the day. The cleaning service was always great. Even the bathmat was changed daily, with a different color every day! Little touches like this made it clear that the owners really cared about what they were doing, adding to the overall charm of the place. The free wireless internet was a blessing. It was great being able to spend downtime over breakfast and before bed keeping in touch with friends and family and searching the internet for information about the next day's adventures in Amsterdam. We stayed five nights in room 10, the Garden Room, which was incredibly quiet. We were amazed at just how peaceful the room was. Even during Holland's string of wins in Euro 2008, with excited football fans in local bars just a block or two away, we were never disturbed. Some of the canal-view rooms might be a bit noisier just because they overlook the street, but the street always seemed very quiet, so noise is certainly not a problem in the hotel, and especially not in the Garden Room. The room itself was small, but not uncomfortably so. It's perfectly-sized for a single or couple who don't plan on spending all day in the room (which you shouldn't be doing in Amsterdam anyway!). There is a little nook for doing work out of sight of the bed, which came in very handy when one of us wanted to sleep while the other needed to use the computer. The only negatives are incredibly minor. The breakfast table in the room was too small for the huge breakfast, but using the bed as extra table space worked fine. As others have noted, and as is true for many hotels in Amsterdam, the staircase is very small and tightly spiraled. You will have a lot of difficulty if you bring bulky or heavy bags. Pack light, and you'll be much happier, both in this hotel and in general. Overall, this is a great hotel, well worth the expense.

As indicated in previous reviews the staircase is almost vertical with very thin steps. Room 8 is exactly as the photo's detail - very large enough for two people and full of antiques. The bath/shower was nice and clean. A great breakfast was delivered each morning to our room - you just let Gunter know what time you would like breakfast and it will be delivered - they are even nice enough to give a courtesy call to the room asking if they could bring up the food in ten minutes. The hotel location is perfect! The hotel itself sits just to the south of Rembrandt Plein (Square) - which is full of restaurants, cafes and a few coffeeshops. Next to the hotel is Barney's Lounge (One of the several Barney's locations around the city). They are open from 10:00am - 01:00am daily. They serve a great cup of coffee and have a very nice cannabis menu - and it's a great place to start and end the day. Many thanks to Andy for all of his great advice.

The card is good for 24, 48 or 72 hours and get's you free travel on Amsterdam trams and buses, free parking for your car, and free entry to most Amsterdam museums (Anne Frank House not included) - plus two free canal cruises.

Our room was made cosy for our arrival with the door opened for us and the lights turned on. We couldn't have felt more welcome! We had been lucky to get the last available room, which they almost made excuses for - small, having no view etc. - when we booked. So we expected something rather basic. But it turned out to be a lovely, cosy and very tastefully decorated room with a soothing garden view of trees and blue sky - giving a calming feeling of being in a green oasis in the middle of the city. I have rarely felt this much at home in a hotel.

Well...considering that a week's stay at the Seven Bridges is about the cost of one (two at the most) night's stay at the Amstel, the answer is an unequivocal yes! The properties of course are not comparable...One is a budget hotel... priced nearly as low as any in the Canal Ring...the other a true 5 Star, but value is a truly important consideration when deciding on lodging. For your $1,200 or so per night at the Amstel, one gets great public spaces...people flocking around serving you...and the opportunity to have a $500,000 Chopard watch delivered to your room. For your $1,200 or so at the Seven Bridges, you get about a week in a cool little Canal House, well located and well decorated with antiques, complimentary modern pieces and oriental rugs. An abundant breakfast is brought to your room on lovely China...all adding to the charming ambiance of the hotel. The peaceful Garden Room 4 was our home for the week of March 27-April 4, 2008 and the only complaint I have is that the table is a bit low. I twice bumped the edge with my long legs, spilling some coffee during the abundant breakfast. Covered with glass, cleanup was easy. That's it...a bit of my clumsiness is the largest finding of fault... This little gem of a place is exactly as advertised...a sparkling clean, calm and beautiful retreat for the independent traveler. Hotel doesn't quite seem the correct word; but it's not a B&B either...It's a labor of love shared by the proprietors for those willing to go through the process to book a room here. The lack of amenities (no elevator, public rooms, bar, etc) are OK considering that Barney's Lounge (Mint tea, milkshakes...and.) is a stumble outside the front door...and the ample dining options (Tempo Doeloe, Mujah Taret, Alfonso's and more) on Utrechtstraat are also just a short stroll...as is Rembrandtplein and its tremendous selection of eateries and little food shops.

The interior stairs are steep, no doubt about it, but Garden 4 is on the entry level...removing that concern. Garden 5, up one flight, is easily one of the nicest rooms you'll find anywhere...and the room's private terrace is a great place to take breakfast during pleasant weather. The Seven Bridges Hotel is a quiet and tremendously refined slightly upscale budget hotel with limited services. It is not an acceptable lodging for those that need to be watched over or have their every question answered, although they will assist their guests however possible.

Seven Bridges is for those who want to experience Amsterdam in an authentic artistic way. There is a lily above the sign outside and there was a scent of lillies as we walked into the hallway. Oscar Wilde and the art deco movement immediately came to my mind... Seven Bridges is a canal house similar to the type Rembrant lived in - a definite visit if you have the time. This is a great opportunity to experience something very unique. The furnishings have been selected with love and care. It is very clean and comfortable. The beautiful breakfast is supplied on exquisite china with plenty extra if you want to pack a little for later (these are heavy trays, but nothing is compromised for the sake of beauty) The hotel is tasteful, conveniently located to the Rembrant Square, where there are buses and cafes, clean and very elegant. We would definitely recommend it. We took the Garden Room number 4 as we had fairly heavy cases and it wasn't far to go up the stairs. A small passage is part of the room and makes it very convenient to put the luggage there with a glass door that closes into the suite. Our hosts were very kind and caring... we were very grateful to see some other rooms. Each contains a uniqueness and elegance of its own. I would suggest if you are chosing a room going up the stairs to bring light compact luggage as the stairs are winding and narrow. This is a characteristic of all canal houses, but good to keep in mind. We would love to come back, and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Seven Bridges... I would definitely spend more time getting to know local people. Everyone we met were so friendly and kind. I felt a bit strange as we didn't speak any Dutch, but English is used everywhere and nobody makes you feel bad for not speaking their language. It was a truly unique and authentic experience.

I don't even know where to start with this review, so I think I'll do bullet points: * The host, Gunther Glaner. Staying at Seven Bridges is like staying at a family friend's home. Except in this case, the family friend is an nurturing antiques collector with a penchant for Art Deco, and the home is a beautiful brownstone situated on a canal. Gunther must have the patience of spider, because prior to my trip, I kept changing my arrival plans. Gunther was accomodating through it all. * The location: Seven Bridges Hotel is named such because at the corner street, when the bridges are lit up at night, you can see straight across the canal and count seven bridges. This area is perfect for strolling around at night - peeking into parlors and walking in moonlight. In fact, we had come here from Paris, and we found this area to be far more romantic that Paris! Upon arrival, I HIGHLY recommend renting bicycles. Amsterdam is bike-friendly, and it is the best way to get around. Once you get a bike, most attractions are minutes away from the hotel. * Breakfast: after a friendly wake-up call, Gunther or Erik will come up to your room to deliver breakfast. Breakfast consists of yogurt, fruit, croissants, bread, cheese, charcuterie, and coffee - set on bone china dishware. A very civilized way to nurse a hangover. * The Antiques: you know, I have to admit that I was reticent to write such a glowing review of Seven Bridges, simply because they *are* reasonable priced, and Amsterdam *does* end attract a certain tourist set on partying heavily. I actually worry for Gunther that he will one day have a guest sully his rug! When we first arrived, Gunther thought it necessary to apologize for the \"temporary\" curtains (\"they are usually blue, but they are at the cleaners...\"), which is a testament to how important aesthetics are to him. Each room is has at least one historically significant piece. Ours had a fantastic marble Art Deco table, among other important pieces.

Getting a GVB pass at the airport is a must. Amsterdam is a small city and it's great to be able to hop on and off the tram, just a short ride to anywhere in the city. The I amsterdam Card is great if you plan on combing every little museum in town, otherwise, I would book online especially Anne Frank House. The advantage is while there's a line around the block, you get to enter through a side door, no wait.

It was our first visit to Amsterdam, and we decided on the Seven Bridges based on all the Trip Advisor reviews. All I can say is \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the reviews could not have been more correct. We decided to stay in Room 6 based on the pictures posted on their web site. For two people, we had plenty of room, and a nice size bathroom with shower. We also wanted a canal view, and this room overlooked one of the prettiest (so we were told on our canal boat tour) in all of Amsterdam. I strongly suggest checking out the web site, as it gives very good detailed information, and I like that you can actually see pictures of the rooms. Keep in mind (as the web site states), the photos are taken with a wide-angle lens, but they are still a very good size. We actually got to see Room 5, and even though it did not have a canal view, it was a little larger and had a little patio where you could sit out (weather permitting) and have breakfast. It was lovely, and next time, we may have to try Room 5. If you are looking to stay in a beautiful, spotless clean, friendly-staffed canal house, then this is the place for you. Our room rate included breakfast, which was served in our room each morning. Fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee, yogurt, fruit, croissants and delicious breads and jam made for a great start to the day, and there was plenty to carry you over to lunch if need be. Each morning we would open up the curtains, sit by the windows and watch the morning unfold Amsterdam style. Gunter, Pierre and Erik were very discreet, and the perfect hosts. If you needed something or had a question, they were there. Otherwise, you were left alone to enjoy and come and go as you please. As for location, you could not ask for better. We used the tram only a few times, as walking is so easy and so much more fun. Pack a pair of good walking shoes, get lost on purpose, and just explore. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to thank Gunter, Pierre and Erik for a memorable stay.

All the good things you read are true! We had room 8 on the top floor, but also had the chance to see some of the other rooms and they all look beautiful. We were originally booked into room 4 with the garden view, but on arrival were asked if we would mind changing as the air conditioning was being installed. (note that this is complete now, for those who complained last summer!). We were happy to change as the new room was lovely, and although we were offered the opportunity to move back to our original booking during our stay, we felt so cosy in our upper room that we elected just to stay there! Our early arrival and check in due to our flight was accomodated without any problems. Similarly on departure, we requested an earlier breakfast, and again this was not a problem. As to the breakfast, well other reviewers have said all there is to say on the huge platters and the tasteful china. Suffice to say that you may not need lunch! As it was March, it was quite cold outside, and it was bliss to return to our cosy room which was always wonderfully warm. In fact, just coming back to the \"hotel\" and walking up the steep steps, it is easy to imagine that this is your home. The hosts are so charming and welcoming, it feels as though you are staying with good friends for a couple of nights, and certainly nothing like being in a hotel. The stairs inside the hotel are very steep, but this is all part of the charm, and we thought it was fun! The location has been well reviewed - we can only repeat that it is an ideal location, easy to get everywhere once you get your bearings, lots of good restaurants nearby and handy for the tram if you don't want to walk any more. The views of the canals are fabulous, and it is easy to sense the history behind the city. As we have been to Amsterdam before, we did not plan to visit any of the usual tourist venues, but the Seven Bridges is ideal for just wandering the banks of the canals and taking in the sights and lifestyle. We have nothing but praise for the hotel, the biggest problem will probably be making a repeat booking, as it is so rare to find such a charming place whose owners really care about their guests!

The room was better than expected as had a T.V & a newly installed fridge cleverly disguised as a marquetry bedside cabinet - sweet touch. Everything was clean & in order as shown in the pictures on their website. Mosquitoes were mentioned in another review so did take repellant although we only saw one in the room. The hotel provided a very useful map with the hotel & a few sites ringed - we walked to most areas in our three 3 night stay.

At first, I was disappointed by the room itself and the lack of a convenient breakfast, but I soon got used to the lack of carpeting and began to realize how nice it was to have the kitchenette. We quickly found a nearby grocery and stocked up, then made our own breakfast each morning. Since we were lodging \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outside\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the main hotel, we never saw the management except when we arrived and when we left.

We never saw the maid service, either, but they came every day and did a good job of keeping things clean. The location was nearly perfect for our needs, since Seven Bridges is located midway between the train station and the museum district. We took a cab there when we arrived, which cost a lot, but by the time we left a week later, we knew which tram to use, and it was about a Euro to get back to the train station. If you wear good walking shoes, you can walk to almost every location in the City that is of tourist interest, which is what we did. I think our area was one of the most charming around. In fact, the canal boat tours all paused at the end of our street, to allow passengers to photograph \"our\" canal and its line of bridges. We felt lucky to be staying where we were. At night, when the bridge arches are lit up, it is just magical. On the same street as the Seven Bridges is a wonderful Italian restaurant. Just a minute's walk down the street takes you to the Rubensplein, a large social square lined with places to eat and drink. Multiple tram lines stop there every few minutes. Once you get familiar with the city's tram system, everything is within reach. Given that many hotels in Amsterdam are in the $250 to $350 range per night, we consider our studio at the Seven Bridges to have been acceptable.

Now for the review. We just loved the Seven Bridges! We loved the accommodation, the location, and the hosts. 1) Accommodation: We stayed in the Garden Suite. We have stayed in many interesting places but this was quite unique. The antiques used to decorate the room were of very high-quality and the room proportions were impressive as well. The high ceilings, fireplace, huge windows, fabulous fabrics, furnishings, and artwork were a real delight. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept like logs. The bathroom was spotless, spacious, bright, and modern. A glass door in the bathroom opened onto a lovely terrace with potted camellias and other plants. We are both appreciative of good design and employ an interior designer for our own home, so we are fairly picky when it comes to these types of things. 2) Location: The location is, in our opinion, perfect. The upscale neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. Yet, it is one block from the tram that provides a very quick trip to the city center station, one block to lovely neighborhood stores and restaurants, and it is, of course, in the heart of canal country. 3) Hosts: The owners of the hotel are two lovely men. We had the most contact with Gunter as he usually delivered our delicious breakfast. We just adored him. He was the kindest and most gracious host. He always seemed so cheerful and ready to offer advice. One thing that really impressed us was that, during our stay, someone from my office contacted the hotel, asking me to call. It turned out to be very sad news (someone I work with had passed away). It was evening and, sensing that something was wrong, Gunter rang our room and offered to bring up tea and cookies. When he arrived, he asked if everything was OK. It was obvious that he brought the refreshments to cheer us up which was just so sweet. In summary, for many reasons, we just loved everything about this hotel. It is the perfect place to stay while in Amsterdam.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cinderford, Gloucestershire", "Title": "\u201cGREAT place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "DeanForesters", "ReviewID": "UR7587443", "Content": "What a lovely to place to stay.

As before, it is a wonderful little property. Gunter and Pierre are so nice, and it feels like you are a guest in their beautiful home. Stayed in room number 8 for my second time, as it is one of only two rooms that have two beds. This room faces the garden and is incredibly peaceful. With an 8 hour time change from the US, an afternoon nap seems to be in order for the first few days, and this garden room is an ideal spot. Just open the windows and listen to the birds sing with the gentle breeze blowing in...heaven. This time I travelled with two friends, so the third wheel got room number 3...also very charming and facing the garden. Tiny bathroom, but who cares? For the price, you are lucky to be getting your own bathroom in this town. We left Amsterdam to travel to Belgium mid-week, and ended up staying at the much more posh and expensive Banks Mansion for our final evening, as a one night stay at Seven Bridges is almost impossible to book for a weekend. Even with all the glitz and luxury, I missed my Seven Bridges. Elevators are over-rated, and I don't feel like I'm really in Amsterdam without dragging my bags up a narrow winding staircase. It's all part of the charm. The location is perfect...central to the whole town. Only one block off Rembrandt Square on a quiet charming canal. Close enough to all the action, but far enough away to enjoy peace and quiet whenever you need it. Breakfast is fantastic...best croissants and coffee this side of Paris...maybe better. I wouldn't be completely honest if I didn't gripe about how much planning it takes to get a room here. They won't take reservations for short stays more than 60 days out, and if you wait to book within 60 days you probably won't get it in. Their cancellation policy is strict and seems to be somewhat at their discretion, but it is worth the effort and planning. I guess with so many repeat customers and only 9 rooms, they can afford to have strict rules. I will definitely return, and it is now one of my top reasons to keep going back to Amsterdam.

On the outside Seven Bridges looks just like a reasonable small hotel but we received a very warm welcome and were taken to the canal side basement apartment where we had agreed to spend our first night as the hotel was fully booked when we had first contacted them. We found the apartment charming being a good size and well furnished so much so that we were reluctant to leave it the next day to move into the main hotel next door. We had booked the small room in the attic which we had been pre-warned entailed climbing a very steep staircase that was not easy which was no exaggeration. The room itself however was very cosy and as described by other travellers well furnished with period pieces. It was a real treat to start our day by having a first class continental breakfast in this room although how they managed to get it up those stairs with it on a tray without breaking the fine china is a mystery.

Right after my wedding, I came to Europe for two years training. Now having completed the course, I searched around for excitement and unique places that may bring her exhilirating experience. Hotel Seven Bridges is my big finding. I was lucky to get a canal view room (room 7) in January. Since then I waited for two long months until this big excitement came to us. My wife is a fan of western arts. I knew she would cherish everything in Seven Bridges. And yes, she actually loved it more than I had expected. From the moment we arrived, we got overwhelmed at how cozy and unique the hotel is. There was a charming fragrance from the two bunches of lily flower in the reception room. When we climbed up the 3 hundred years stairs, we saw two other rooms (room 5 and room 6) had been set ready for their guests. Both rooms are extremely nice and have its special lay-out and art collections. The lights were all on and the atmosphere was really cozy. My wife couldn't resist rushing in to take some photos. You could see how delicately the owners of the hotel are caring their properties. We were completely beyond words. When we arrived at our room, we immediately responded with a 'wow\"! Everything was spotlessly clean and the canal view was so romantic. We loved the furniture, especially the pair of classic chairs. The best thing about Seven Bridges is the breakfast. It was the ever best breakfast I tasted in Europe - a huge one, with various breads, juice, coffee, tea, fruits... god! The owner sent the breakfast into our room by himself. That was the most tasteful coffee I had in my trips. We blieved that the host spends lot of time in designing and organizing the breakfast. We actually couldn't finish all the foods. What a pitty! Anyhow, I found that we did not need to eat lunch for this fabulous breakfast. It was also a great experience to talk with the owner. He is a very kind and respectable man, investing all his energy and brains in providing unique experiences for the Seven Bridges guests. We were happy and honored to learn from him that we were the first Chinese guests. I have seen some other 'big name' hotels in Amsterdam. In my view, they are just common, and located in the 'noisy' and crowded city center. The best thing about Amsterdam is its canals and the houses along the waters. Those communities are not far from city center as Amsterdam is not big, but very quiet and enjoyable. It was so interesting that we just turned a corner from the main street and suddenly entered the quiet neighbourhood. Seven Bridges is just located in the center of that quiet neighbourhood, with walking distance to all the major sites and a long dinning street just behind it. This also addes a lot of points to its overall impression to us. Having said all these, I want to clarify that business travellers with a vision to see big big lobbies, large large rooms, bath tube, smiling receptionist girl, elevators... better step away from this lovely hotel. Seven Bridges and Hilton are not on the same track! If Hilton is a rich business man, Seven Bridges is a real artist! Seven Bridges only belongs to those with a vision to seek the unique experience of arts in Amsterdam! Finally, I want to say that Amsterdam is a very safe city - just be careful of your handbags. At least we did not experience anything unpleasant walking around 10 o'clock at night around the city.

After he left, it occurred again, so once again he cheerfully ran up the stairs and corrected the problem again.

We have been to Amsterdam 5 or 6 times and have stayed at a different hotel each time, All of them came well recommended on this website (each with a bad review or two amidst a ton of good reviews) and all have been nice -- imperfect in some way, but all very good in some way. Seven Bridges is one of the better places we have stayed, and we can recommend it without hesitation. If you want a traditional hotel room at a major inner city hotel with a fancy lobby, this is not the place for you. What Seven Bridges was for us was a quaint, local guesthouse, a very nicely appointed room in a very convenient and central location, very convenient to public transportation, yet on a relatively quiet street in a great neighborhood. It would have been nice to have a larger and more expensive room that was eligible for breakfast (particularly after reading the reviews of the breakfast) -- we would have gladly taken it had it been available -- but Room A was the only room available, and it was charming and perfectly acceptable, and made up for the lack of breakfast with a kitchenette. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was small but perfectly adequate, it was very clean and well appointed. The kitchenette had a fridge and a stove that came in very handy (we were able to eat a meal or two in, and reheat some great Indonesian food from Indrapura and Tempo Doloe, two excellent restaurants nearby). The pictures of Room A on the hotel's website are completely accurate. Apart from the room, the owners and the staff were helpful and courteous to a fault, and the only other room in the hotel which we were able to see (the owner showed it to us briefly on the morning we checked out) was much more substantial and charming as well. Perfect?? No, not perfect. Did we love it?? Yes. Is this a place we would consider returning to in the future? Yes, without a doubt.

There's a TV to the right of the front door which has a number of channels including BBC. On the marble floor there are 2 colourful rugs.

Yet there was a large LCD T.V and wireless internet connection for your convenience. The hotel initself is quite small, with only a handful of rooms, there is no dining room but that wasnt a problem becasue we enjoyed breakfast delivered to our room every morning, and might i say what a delicious plentyful breakfast it was. Location, well, you couldnt ask for a better location, 5 minutes walk from Rembrandt square where you will find plenty of activity, pubs, clubs, dining areas and all the shops your desire. It is however just far enough were you can get a goodnight's sleep over the weekend when the square is packed with partiers. The tram station is also a three minute walk away which makes it very convient, but in all honesty, we did most of our sightseeing by foot, the hotel is quite centrally located to many of the touristic areas. There are only a handful of people working in the hotel which is quite pleasant as you get an immediant sense of warmth and hospitality especially from Gunter the hotel manager, who delivered breakfast to our room himself! The only negative point i will say is the staircase leading to the rooms, it really is quite steep, so i wont recomment any seniors with hip arthritis problems to stay there as they will have a difficult time climbing up and down the stairs, also, if your wife makes you pack very large suitcases, then that will be an issue as well!!! Otherwise, i highly recommend the hotel, particularly room #5 that had a lovely padio that overlooked a garden, we had our coffee everymorning on the padio enjoying the cool breeze.

And it did it in such a charming, effortless way that this was the most relaxing holiday I think I have ever had. In fact, contrary to the review previous to this one, I don't think I've ever had a better night's sleep. Our room (number 8) was charming, clean and very well decorated. We were served the finest breakfast in our rooms and the hotel staff were incrediably accomodating. The even managed to satisfy my hunger with delicious jams and breads so that I was not at all envious of my boyriend's coffee and croissants which I cannot eat because of an allergy. The location of the hotel was also top notch and I wish that I had been able to stay for longer. It is not possible to give this hotel anything but 5 out of 5. If you do decide to stay there, please do not be put off by the two beds in room 8 rather than one double, they are a very generous size and are simply a slightly smaller version of a double.", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Godalming, England", "Title": "\u201cWhat a very special hotel!\u201d", "Author": "JanFr", "ReviewID": "UR5783844", "Content": "This is a very special hotel for people who appreciate staying in a genuine canal-side house rather than a plastic hotel that you could find in any city in the world.

One of them being German helped a lot in this respect. As an unexpected add-on a Tibetan Buddhist center is right next door where you can join meditation sessions and find a well-assorted bookshop. What was the biggest surprise was the fact that in two minutes walking distance you will find Amsterdam's most beautiful garden as part of Geelvinck Hinlopen Huis museum (-). This is still an insder info as this musuem only opened in Feb 06. Have a coffee in the mystic garden and enjoy chatting with one of Amsterdam's \"Grand Dames\" who is running the museum and actually is inhabiting it. Coming from Hamburg we are familiar with high priced parking lots. But man Amsterdam is cheeky. They will ask EUR 3,40 per hour ! So if you are lucky (as we were) to find a parking lot right in front of Seven Bridges, have a lot of small change ready to feed this parking machine. It will not accept bank notes, but only coins. So, if you want to stay over night ... ask at Seven Bridges for not as high piced alternatives.

We had absolutely no problems with our reservations, with our payments or anything else. The whole experience was a happy one. We were so complimentary about our stay, our family wanted to come and see our room. Thank you Pierre, Gunther and Eric.

The rooms are both quaint and eclectic, and many have canal views. The rooms are very clean, and were well attended to each day of our stay. The owners were incredibly helpful, and made our trip to Amsterdam a complete pleasure. The price of the rooms was a value compared to some of the other rooms available in other hotels. As some have noted, it is sort of a mix between a hotel and B&B, and is very quiet, with broadband internet connections in every room, some with mini-refrigerators. I have to admit that when I ran across this website, I read through some of the reviews below out of curiosity, 95% of which are quite accurate. As far as the ones stating that the owners had tried to double-charge them... Well, I have a very, very difficult time believing this now that I've stayed at the Seven Bridges. The staff of the Seven Bridges was incredibly helpful, especially given our unique circumstances, and I'm certain that they would never, ever intentionally try to cheat someone. I highly recommend the Seven Bridges, and if I am ever in Amsterdam again, I will go out of my way to assure that I can again stay at this exceptional place.", "Date": "September 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erie, PA", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite hotel in Holland\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3724362", "Content": "I always stay at this hotel when I stay in Amsterdam (I regularly go to Europe for business).

Since we visit Amsterdam--one of the truly wonderful cities in Europe--at least twice a year, it won't be the last. If we're lucky. I write this rave review with some concern--concern that the next time we try to book the hotel, TripAdvisor readers will already have snared MY room! This hotel has two owners/managers (Pierre & Gunther) and several assistants, including the superb Eric. They somehow manage to care for the guests (and I talked with seven other guests over our week's stay) as if they were house guests. When I requested a firmer pillow it was followed up. And when a change of linens meant a change to a duvet, Pierre asked if we were comfortable with the new bed treatment. At the same time, they are not obtrusive in the least--one could stay there and have a conversation only at check-in and check-out if that would be preferred. The room service breakfasts were just about perfect--we wouldn't change a thing. And the cleanliness of the individually-designed and furnished rooms was at the ultimate world standard--namely, the Dutch standard!

I think the problem is that some rooms are quite a lot better than others and so you're taking a chance that you will get one of the good ones. Ours was right on the top flooor and it was quite nice, on the small side but quite cosy. The bathroom wasn't much to write home about, there was no bath (I think there are showers only at this hotel), and no toiletries. The assorted bread rolls at breakfast (there is no restuarant so its breakfast in bed every day!) were very good. As a previous reviewer has mentioned it would have been nice to have juice. My partner doesn't drink tea or coffee in the morning and although we requested juice instead for him it never came. There was no explanation and this happened twice. I think maybe they meant to buy juice but forgot. So although the attention to detail in this hotel is good in some areas such as eclectic furnishings, in other areas they just don't seem bothered. As I paid \u00c2\u00a3100 per night for the room it wasn't good value for money for me- small room & poor service.

The next morning , October 8, 2004, as we were leaving for the airport to return home to Portland, I went to the owner and paid him the 240Euros due. I paid him in cash and asked for a receipt. He acted indignant and said he was out of receipts and did not have time to go get more since he had to run the place alone. As we had a plane to catch, I was unable to do anything other than write down the amount I paid him in my spiral notebook. I signed a blank VISA paper when we checked in and I was told it would be destroyed if I paid cash,WHICH I DID.

As it is a quiet area (and yet only one block from Rembrandtplein), there was not too much noise from the streets to be a bother. The room itself was decent and spacious although there could be more amenities in the bathroom (just small pieces of soap). The breakfast in the room is a nice treat (but could be better with juice). Those steep stairs were a bit tough with the luggage but I think you find these in almost all such places in Amsterdam. It is a nice charming place with character.
