This is a hotel where the staff is truly efficient and helpful. Me and my wife came down with food poisoning after having eaten some mexican food from a mall nearby and the hotel staff took good care of my us by helping with medicines and speecific food. Its an efficient business hotel. The only problem I had was with the Doctor that they had sent across for treating us Dr.Santiago Reyes, who fleeced us by asking for 2800 pesos just for giving some medicines on what was just a normal stomach infection. He said its for an injection, when I was telling them it is not required, simple antibiotics was enough. But that's Mexico for you, people can commit fraud at any moment so watch out. Apart from that incident we had a pleasant stay here with a truly warm and couteous staff.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, good price\u201d", "Author": "Lanagoncalo", "ReviewID": "UR124459259", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel.

The hotel was very modern and European in style. It looked as though it had been furnished by IKEA. I was very pleased with the room, the bed, bathroom and cleanliness. The breakfast buffet was good (you can negotiate that as part of your room price if you ask ahead of time). WIFI is fee and supposedly accessible throughtout the hotel but my room was at the end of the corridor and I couldn't access the internet. There is no express checkout so allow yourself plenty of time to check out - it was painfully slow if you are used to checking out of US hotels.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fiesta Inn Insurgentes Sur", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d2045297-Reviews-Fiesta_Inn_Insurgentes_Sur-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$112 - $164*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mercaderes No. 20</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
