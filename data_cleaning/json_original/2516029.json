It reminded me of a motel, rather than a comfortable, conference hotel. I located my room behind a large, beat-up kitchen-style door that led to a narrow hallway. My room was the last room on the row with a huge picture window. I have never seen anything like this before, and as a single woman, I felt completely exposed, despite the curtain. Also, the shower head was non-working. On requesting another room, I was told that I could wait for a renovated room. I had no idea that some rooms were renovated and others were not. The new room was fairly up to Sheraton standards, aside from a smelly sink faucet...please get your pipes cleaned. At that point, I was too tired to complain and simply dealt with it for the next two days. The best thing about our stay though was the amazing staff on hand....despite any initial problems, our requests were accommodated and needs met with a smile.

After many positive reviews and looking at other properties, I finally decided on the Four Points Sheraton LAX. I could tell from the reviews and photos that the property was undergoing a makeover, though the building itself was clearly older. The common areas (lobby, bar/lounge area, etc.) looked fresh and modern. So far so good, and met the expectations I had from doing my Trip Advisor research. Things fell apart when I got to my room in the middle tower. The only window opened to the hallway. The hallway in turn had (dusty) windows overlooking the pool area. In other words, the original design of this tower is just odd. For privacy, you have to close the curtains or shades and then you have no natural light. There was also a lot of noise from the people and housekeeping staff going by; the windows don't offer much sound insulation. The thermostat didn't seem to work. The cool air was noisy and kept blowing no matter what I set the temp to, so I had to turn it off completely. Then the room got too warm and eventually woke me up, not to mention the mattress felt like it was dropping slightly down and away from the headboard, toward my feet. The room itself was recently updated, nothing great just nice by today's standards. Pretty much every major hotel chain is following the same retro-modern updates for their second and third tier chains (Holiday Inn Express, Hyatt Place, Springhill Suites, Courtyard by Marriott, etc.). This is not a complaint at all, and a trend I whole-heartedly endorse. There was no closet--only an armoire crammed into the bathroom between the shower/toilet on the left and sink/vanity area to the right. The armoire was not deep enough for me to hang my garment bag, slightly annoying. Also, they have energy saver, motion-sensor light switches in unintuitive locations. The sink area light was on the wall outside the bathroom and the shower/toilet light was outside the doorway as well. Once, I was on the toilet and the light just switched off while I was sitting there. Shortly after checking in, a housekeeper barged in without knocking as I was working at the desk. She was apologetic and said \"oh, I'm sorry, did you check in?\" I'm thinking \"yes, how do you think I got in?\" (I could've been watching porn or something--how embarrassing!) After the first night, I decided to ask for a different room. I was relieved that the front desk gave no resistance to the request. But when she went to find a room in a different tower, the rooms there had not been redecorated (no flat-panel TV, for example). I thought a minute and decided it couldn't be worse than the first room, especially if it had an exterior window instead of hallway window. I'm glad I switched. The room was definitely quieter and more comfortable. The bathroom fixtures looked pretty ancient, but I didn't mind taking everything else into account. The first night, I was too tired to drive anywhere for dinner. I was intrigued by the Brewster's Bar in the lobby, which offers over 100 different beers (about 10 on tap and the rest in bottles). I didn't have high hopes for the hotel food, and I was right. With my first (yummy) Belgian-style ale, I ordered the \"charcuterie\" off the small plates menu. The description was assorted \"salumi and cheeses.\" When the plate arrived, I couldn't have been more disappointed. I love plain old salami but what appeared was slices of supermarket pepperoni and ham or Canadian bacon--accompanied by rubbery sticks of bland white and pepper jack cheeses. Some nerve calling it \"charcuterie\" or \"salumi\"! With my second beer, I just went for traditional buffalo wings and seasoned fries. Nothing you can't get at home from Costco frozen foods, but at least I knew what I was getting. The beer selection is truly impressive and easy to read. They also provide a glass of big pretzel sticks when you are seated. In any case, I can definitely recommend the bar as the highlight of the entire property. Note that their definition of \"happy hour\" includes drink specials but no food specials. I am bummed because my default hotel (Sheraton LAX Gateway) was over our company's hotel limit for the dates I needed. I get to book my own travel and pick my own hotels so can stay pretty much anywhere. After doing the research on Trip Advisor, I never imagined it would be this disappointing. I am definitely not a hotel snob but won't be coming back.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFine for what I needed.\u201d", "Author": "tdmac", "ReviewID": "UR127121357", "Content": "I was at the Four Points Sheraton with a group rate for an intensive 5 days.

So I immediately selected Four Point Hotel by Sheraton, however when I initially showed up to check in, there seemed to be some confusion at the front desk. The manager, Adam was not there, but once word got to him, he quickly resolved the matter! From that moment on, service was excellent. I inquiried about golf courses and the consi went about searching for various course, but he took the time and the crew which one informed me of a golf course in Cypress City, Seal Beach Golf course which one famous golfer grew up on. I played three straight days there and had a blast, although my score was a little sub-par.... excuse the pun! It was well worth the drive there! Finally, one night late around 1:30am I notice the water pressure was very low, and thought little of it. Well, when it came time for me to check out, I was reimburse for two nights stay!

It has convenient and free parking (my overnight parking was free with validation- I see other comments to the contrary here, so double-check this before booking), check-in is quick and efficient, rooms are neat and tidy, beds are comfortable, wireless internet is available. The hotel was completely quiet at night and I had a very restful sleep. I was here just one night after a business trip to L.A. and was completely satisfied with my experience. I have stayed in other Four Points properties that were less than stellar, but this is a pretty nice one. I used Starwood points to pay for my room, so there was no charge. However, when researching options for a quick overnight in L.A., this was one of the more affordable properties on the Westside. I think it's a good value. The neighborhood is fine. Culver City has gotten really nice in the past decade, and while this isn't the chic end of town, it's just a 10-minute drive to downtown Culver City for shopping and restaurants. You've also got easy access to the 405 from here, so you can be anywhere pretty quickly, traffic allowing. This is not really an \"airport hotel\" in that it's not right next to the airport. But if you have a rental car, it's a great place to stay the night before you turn in your car and head out of town. It's close enough to be quite convenient. If I was coming to L.A. with the family for the first time to sightsee, this probably wouldn't be my first choice. I'd look for something more central and scenic, even if it was a bit more expensive. However, for my purposes, this was the perfect place to crash before a morning flight, and I was pleased with my experience.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asbury Park, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cA good employee makes all the difference!\u201d", "Author": "sonja o", "ReviewID": "UR123979983", "Content": "Just had a wonderful experience when relaxing in the lobby of this hotel.

I see some reviews here that talk about the price of parking, the rooms being basic etc. Okay this is LAX which means you are going to pay for your parking no matter where you stay in the area. My room was clean, nice and comfortable. Internet was also free which is a huge bonus for those of us who travel. Some or most hotels charge for this service. The best part was the value. This hotel is very reasonable for the price I paid for my weekday room which was around $100 for the night. Can't beat that!

It was situated near LAX so the rate was a steal. When we arrived, check-in was painless and the room was very clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets had a strong smell of bleach, which I can overlook for the most part. There were a lot of dings and dents throughout the room but overall, it was a pleasant place to stay. You can hear the people in the next room through the shared door, but thank god they weren't roudy or rude. Other than that it was pretty quiet. There was a situation with the elevators. We wanted to go eat and out of the three elevators that were there, only one worked at around 10pm, when there were maybe 8-9 people waiting. And the elevators were very small and EXTREMELY SLOW for just having only three so it was about a 10 minute wait for an elevator to go up and come back down. In the morning, two of the three were operational. We were excited to see that they had room service, but at a 16% gratuity and a $3 delivery charge, we decided to not waste our money, especially not knowing if the food would be any good. So we decided to go downstairs to the Bar and Grill restaurant in the lobby, and it was packed. No one greeted us at the door, which would have been fine if they were busy, but the staff was just standing around, chatting. There was plenty of seating in the back which were we were going to sit, but that is when we attracted one of the waiters. The waiter was not helpful or welcoming at all. He handed us two menus, which was a wrinkled, single sheet of card stock, and then walked off. THE PARKING This situation alone killed the experience at the hotel. In the front, there is valet parking, which was empty, because I believe no one would want to pay $25 a day for parking. We were able to park in a space in the area that was not sectioned off as Valet, the first night we arrived with no issue. Apparently, when you first check-in, you can park in that area, but after than you would have to pay $19 a night to park in a jam packed parking lot in the back. There was a sign in the lobby that said that they were renovating their parking system, but I didn't see anything indicating as such. The only time I saw anything resembling construction was workers repairing the street.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Deal on Holiday Stays\u201d", "Author": "spcy", "ReviewID": "UR122074893", "Content": "This is not my first time staying at this hotel.

There are good options for restaurants within 3-5 miles of the hotel. That is a real plus when you realize how long it takes you to get 3-5 miles in LA with the traffic. A 3 mile ride can take 30 minutes or more. The bad - Our room was 64 degrees and the only way we could warm it up was to turn off the a/c and open the door. We called and were told it was area controlled and that was our only option. Our room opened to a hallway and all night long partiers were slamming doors, laughing, talking loudly and so needless to say, we got little rest.

Even if we were a bit tired after an 8 hour flight, we took the concierge\u2019s advice and went on a 4 hour tour to visit L.A. After the tour, we went to our room... it was nice. I just didn\u2019t understand the lights: there was this timer installed on the lights so they would turned off by themselves after a while and turned on when would would pass by (so no need to touch the switch). The timer were setup to turn off after 5 minutes or more (at least it felt like it). So during the night, if you needed to go to the bathroom, the main light would turn on, then the bathroom light would turn on and would still be on for over 5 minutes after you went to bed. For me, this was pointless so I turned of this feature on all the switches. Other than that, the room was nice and cozy. I would stay there again, especially being a Starwood member.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cok stay - terrible service in the bar\u201d", "Author": "PJ_SYD", "ReviewID": "UR120776243", "Content": "We arrived late - check-in was smooth and efficient.

We watched them having their order taken, drinks and food served and practically finished while the same waitress who was in charge of our table never came back after dropping off our menus. At the time there were 3 other tables max occupied - 2 of which were just sitting on a round of drinks - so there was no real excuse for the delay. After waiting for more than half an hour i went up to the bar to complain that we had been waiting for a long time and to ask if someone could take our order. The guy behind the bar didn't really react but said he would send someone over. 5 minutes later the waitress came over and simply said \"oh are you ready to order now?\" No apology, nothing - just a very dismissive attitude. After another wait, the decidedly mediocre cocktails and bar food were finally served. We complained to the duty manager after check-out the next day and although apologies were made and an offer to make an adjustment to the bill, no credit was made to our account. The room & bathroom were small but comfortable and functional - it looked like it had been made over recently. The room location was a bit odd though. The only room windows overlooked the communal hallway so you couldn't really be in the room without drawing the curtains unless you wanted to be looked in on.

Very accomodating concept --- you have to arrange and ask for it at booking -- but a very nice feature for air travellers. It's not available on the lowest room rates - but for an extra $20 off the bargain basement rates, the flexibility is wonderful.. Staff was great, decor was a re-do in a modern chic style ... nice in some aspects, wierd in others. The rooms don't have drawers - but cubicle bins - -- It's definately a remodel on an old creepy hotel. Long corridors with low ceilings and the bathroom is done in a full white redo -- but the heavy textured wallpaper over the existing tiling? or something and the paint/overlay on the tub and tile was already starting to peel a little -- made you wonder what else they \"cheaped out\" in the re-do -- I could already see the paint/overlay peeling off on the wear points on the elevator doors. Windows on our room were absolutely filthy -- we could barely see out of them. Restaurant was friendly and wide beer selection was fun, appetizers were good and overall both hotel and restaurant staff were extremely helpful.. The exercise room is GREAT! great machines, lots of space, yoga mats and a good attendant. Outdoor pool was cold -- but it was early October -- nice pool area, but they could have done more to make it not just a summer thing -- pool could have been heated, there could have been a hot tub and the nice looking outdoor bar could have been staffed -- but instead it was just cold and empty, even though it was a bright sunny day . Would be a definitely consider this hotel again for a layover because of great staff and accomodating policies and nice bar and exercise room and convenient location... but not for an extended stay --- and I'm not sure it's going to age well......", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cVery average\u201d", "Author": "Nettersbetter", "ReviewID": "UR119488165", "Content": "Though this hotel is newly refurbished, I found it to be very average.

Last things first - on my last day there was an area power outtage lasting several hours. All electricity in the hotel was effected and guests had to get their luggage down to the lobby by the stairs because the elevators did not work. Does this hotel have a protocol for emergencies? I would expect that protocol for a major power outtage would require guest notification of electricity interruption via staff going room to room to offer luggage assistance and to explain the situation to the guests. No notification by LAX 4Points staff was remitted until the guest made it down to the lobby area (via the dark stairway). Other negatives: During my stay, the shower fixture broke off and thereafter spurted water from the side, the bathtub would not hold water, the buffet breakfast was dry, and - prior to the outtage - the maid knocked on my door at 10:30 am - \"sorry, just checking\". I know that chain hotels like their maids to knock on guests' doors one or two or three times before posted checkout time. Here is my suggestion for the hotel: Assign the maids the duty to perform the emergency guest services so sorely needed. First knock - replace \"sorry, just checking\" with either \"need any assistance with checkout\" or \"no emergencies yet\" or \"emergency [e.g., no elevator] - do you need assistance\"; 2nd knock - (see 1st knock, above), etc. The benefit of my suggestion for the hotel is that, at no extra expense, the hotel could comply with the basic rules of civility, and with local, state or federal regulations requiring contingency plans for the circumstances I encountered. And the benefit to the guests is that annoyance is replaced by assurance/assistance.

At first we were skeptical because it was substantially lower than the lowest advertised room rate, but everything was legitimate. For almost $50 cheaper than comparable rooms in the Santa Monica area, the drive may be a bit longer, but the savings were well worth it. However, parking here is $19, but there are in and out privileges. Regardless, Four Points was still cheaper than a lot of other hotels in the area!

After my stay at the Sheraton Gateway LAX, I have to post. First of all the rate seemed too good to be true. I had read the negative reviews and thought -its a Sheraton property who bad can it be? I booked direct with the hotel. I have stayed at various LAX hotels but never at the Four Points LAX. The rate was what encouraged me to give it a try. When I arrived the lobby looked clean and pleasant. The check in was not warm and friendly. It was very matter of fact. The windows along the walkway to my room were filthy. The maids in the hallway were accompanied by a man that I caught staring into the room of a guest. I looked to see what he was looking at and it was a another female guest (creepy). The windows face into hallway that has windows to the outside. Everyone walking by can see into your room if you raise the blinds. Dirty room service trays were sitting in the hallway. My arrival to the room was a huge disappointment. It smelled musty and damp. There were stains on everything. The decorative pillows on the bed looked stained and well worn. The bedspeads were tired. There were no cups for the mini coffee maker. The room was basic old and roughed up. It looked like they had painted over mold in the bathroom. The tub was cracked and stained. The carpet was dirty. There was rust all around the door frame in the bathroom. The A/C did not work well. Then the bed...very tired sagging and old! So uncomfortable. Now I understood the low rate. O and for breakfast you can have for $10.00 (+ gratuity/svc chg) a bowl of oat mill - by the time you add to that coffee and juice (well you get the point a very pricey breakfast. The maids will start yelling down the hall at each other at 6am. They will bang their carts around and do everything to wake everyone up. After looking back through the reviews I now understand. The Manager refers to their remodeling etc. The should advise that for the low rate, you get a room that is subpar to an old Quality Inn. It should be embarrassing to Sheraton to allow these rooms to be in their network. \"Traditional Room\" - means old tired and musty. \"Deluxe\" means we give you the quality that you expect out of Sheraton. I am sure GM Phil will be happy to get all those who are disappointed into one of the \"Deluxe\" rooms for the same low rate when they return -HA! This GM needs to spend some nights in his \"traditional rooms\". When I checked out, The lady did not ask about my stay (she probably knew). She did not say good morning/ thank you or get lost. When I said I was checking out she said \"didn't you get the receipt under your door?\" Sorry Sheraton Four Points ...you do not get my vote. Who will want to return when you finish your remodeling??? You did not win my business and won't get it again! I work for a major corporation that travels into LAX frequently and Four points will not be our hotel of choice. If this place had a manager, they would at least QC their older rooms and keep them as clean as possible - and throw in a free continental breakfast. It would certainly do something to say ** \"Hey we are not what we are going to be..but we want you to know we appreciate you putting up with our very rough edges\" **. \"Here is a coupon for a free breakfast and please come back when we finish our remodeling\". That would work for me! Or how about a clean room and a small basket with a banana and a muffin and have a card that says \"Thank You\". And actually have cups in the room so people can use the coffee maker. Or have a central area on each floor in the morning with fresh coffee. I guess I can't turn my marketing mind off. There is so much this hotel *could do* if they only had imagination and had someone with initiative to lead.

I would like to share my horrible experience with all travellers around the world who are going to Los Angeles either for vacation/business or with a family, especially Europeans who might not be aware of the situation. Do not stay here. Its not worth it. Location is not to far from a bad side of town. Paid the entire stay in advance, 2 nights, $190 in full - several days ago with a credit card. At the check-in, a woman by the name of \"G\" ( name witheld by the author ) the unfriendly supervisor, demended additional $100 in cash or $50 with credit card a day, additional \"deposit\" just in case that : \" when we leave we do not take their flat TV ( the one they so desperatelly advertise ) with us back home. Even though these 2 nights were booked and paid in advance entirelly - IN FULL - she stated that if I do not give additional $100 in cash \"for the unforseen situations in the future\", we can go to another hotel. As you can see, the staff here wasn't friendly, efficient and helpful. She clearly demonstrated she did not care if I would stay there or not - and if 2 nights were already paid. She said that if I dont give her additional $100 in cash she would not check me in but would not hesitate to call the police and ask me to leave the property if necessary even though 2 nights were already paid in FULL. I have degree in Criminology and this was totally out of line for a hotel supervisor to say to a guest who already invested money in this travel, flight and hotel. I did not get used to such terrible and direspectful hotel check-in service, I was shocked for awhile in disbelief. She then offered me to refund my booking agency in full for both nights, would not check me in - without $100 in cash under any circumstance, however the refund money for 2 nights which had been already paid in full - would be posted back to my Credit Card and become available in a week from now. In other words, this hotel got paid for 2 nights in advance, in FULL and secured the payment in FULL - made a promise that I would have this room for 2 nights, but would not care if they cancel my stay at the Check-in point unless I give them additional $100 in cash, which would leave me to have NO hotel for 2 nights. While they still have my $190 which would be unavailable to me for another 7 days. I so badly wanted to make reservation with another hotel. When the business doesnt care about having the payment in full already in their hands and in advance, and they treat me as if - my money and time does not matter to them, and their promise means nothing, the reservation means nothing, the relationship with booking agency means nothing, the payment in full in advance means nothing, I as a guest mean nothing - then I do not want to reward the bad business for the bad business and a bad treatment. However, my option to make reservation the very same hour, and the very same day with another hotel were limited at that point, and would require another $200 dollars, because the reservation would have to be made the very same day - and I would have to travel to that place, and pay all inconvencies myself, in addition to spending another $200 and lose additional valuable time! Had I known this will take the place, I could have picked another hotel and had great experience. I travel relativelly often, prior to this hotel, had stayed in 2 other hotels in Los Angeles. Neither insisted on additional cash for already paid nights in advance, had undisclosed hidden charges, put a condition on a check-in or offered such a poor treatment to the guests! I want to save someone else the headache of staying in this hotel: don't ever consider staying at the Four Points LAX.

Be ready to wait for an extra shuttle if you're towards the end terminals at LAX! Now onto the hotel itself- The lobby was nice enough, there's a restaurant, bar and a gift shop. The restaurant that we had planned to eat at had closed earlier and the gift shop was also closed. This left us pretty much one option as far as food- room service. There aren't any other food options within walking distance except a Burger King down the road, so keep that in mind. The room itself left much to be desired. The hotel rooms look very, very worn. You can tell that the non-smoking rooms were converted because the walls still smell of decades of smoke. The bed was the most rock solid thing I think I've ever slept on, and the outside noises were pouring in through the poorly insulated window. The air conditioning hardly worked, it kept the room around 80 degrees overnight- which was actually warmer than it was outside. The bathroom was pretty small and the tub looked 30+ years old, it had to be the oldest tub I've ever seen at a hotel! They had the typical \"fake ceiling\" that is used to cover up an older, mold damaged ceiling. The sink was built onto a wooden vanity constructed on a base of some unpainted 2X4's, maybe they had just replaced the wood or something, but it looked tacky as heck. Overall the property is old and shows it's age. The \"non smoking\" aspect doesn't fly when the hallways and rooms just reek of lingering decades of smoke. We got a decent deal (under $90) but in the end, there were properties around the area that were a few bucks more and next time I'll be looking into one of those.

Maybe my memory is faulty, or more likely, the hotel has gone down hill ... a lot! When I checked in, I was given a room in the back building, which requires a walk through the ballroom area to a very remote bank of elevators. No big deal, but that building seems to have been annexed onto the main building (because the upper floors don't line up. Perhaps the distance from the main building is a problem for the housekeeping staff, because when I got there (to a very hot room), the bathroom was short some towels and soap, and worse, there was a wet dirtly towel lying on the desk!! So, frustrated (and not wanting to collect my things and trek back to the front desk, I called housekeeping and let them know that I needed some soap and clean towels, and asked them to remove the dirty towel. They said they'd send someone up ... and when he arrived, he had the coffee that (he thought) I'd requested! (What? ... Coffee? ... How does \"Soap\" sound like \"Coffee\"??) (He did bring some, but not all the towels). Anyway, after asking him to remove the dirty towel (which evidently they hadn't told him about), he did go back and get the bar of soap I'd requested. After that, I went down to the (mostly empty) restaurant for a quick dinner. When I got to the restaurant reception desk, there was a very frustrated couple having a heated conversation with the gentleman behind the counter. When they stormed off, he showed me to my table and appologized that I had to hear the dissagreement with the previous patrons (although he placed all the blame on them). The waiter brought me a menu and some rolls. Then I waited, for about 15 mins, until another person was seated near me, and the waiter finally came back to take my order. When I asked what the \"catch of the day\" was, he said \"tilapia\". When I hesitated, he said the also have \"fillet of sole\" ... which I ordered. Imagine my surprise when he brought my dinner, and it was swordfish! Not a problem, really, but he didn't seem to notice until I called him on it! After dinner, I asked the waiter what time breakfast was served (since I had an 8:30 flight out). He said they open for breakfast at 6:00 am (which would just about give me enough time to have a quick breakfast and catch the shuttle to the airport (about a 1/2 mile) in the morning in time for my flight. Also, at a hotel at this level, you don't expect to see an old curved screen CRT television ... maybe it's a \"retro\" thing? Oh well, I only needed to stay for the one night, so the next morning I got up early enough to get ready and go down for breakfast (which was included as part of my room package). I arrived back at the restaurant at 6:00 am but was surprised to see it was dark. So, I went over to the hotel front desk and asked when and where they serve breakfast ... the woman there said that the restaurant should be opening about now and I had gone to the right place. So, figuring I might be a couple of minutes early, I went back to the restaurant and waited for about 5 minutes when a gentleman came out from the kitchen and (looking at me like I was in the wrong place) said the cook was \"sick\" that morning and to come back at 7:00 am (which was too late for me ... I told him that, but he didn't seem to care, and offered not alternatives). An airport hotel doesn't have more than one cook (it's a major international airport, so people are coming and going at all times ... and leaving early to catch a flight should be expected ... but they don't have a back-up plan!). I was more than happy to leave and have breakfast at the airport while waiting for my fligh!

The value for that $99 at Four Points was impressive. Unlike the W, Four Points offers free Internet, free water, free coffee in room and free LAX shuttle. None of these were offered at the W, Internet was $15 a day. Four Points beat W with quicker room service with better food and a lower service charge. Four Points is less than a mile from LAX yet was much quieter than W. (I had to call four times for neighbors' noise at W, and they never did stop partying). I had elevator problems at both hotels, at the W, I was told to go to the front desk by a bell hop since my floor access key was not working rather than help me access my floor. Instead a fellow guest let me use his key in the elevator. At Four Points, before we had a chance to ask for help, a night manager gathered several guests and took us to the service elevator so that we would not have wait to get to our rooms. All in all, my visit at the Fout Points was a complete breeze. I was very happy with all the staff, even when I had to call for a bathtub faucet repair. Maintenance was up in less than five minutes.

A female behind the counter was laughing while watching him in action. We booked a night city tour through the hotel and asked about options for a ride to the port for our cruise the next day. The concierge said she would take care of it for us. She should have told us it was going to cost $70 bucks for the ride instead of us finding out when getting out of the car! After arriving back at the hotel following our honeymoon cruise, the concierge again offered poor advice when we asked about transportation options to Hollywood. She said it would not be easy for us without having a car and advised us to catch a shuttle from LAX. Terrible advice. Another $35 wasted and we had to walk several blocks to our destination and were left with no ride back to our hotel. After asking a tour guide we booked outside the hotel, he advised we take the train back to LAX and then the hotel shuttle. We could have spent $12 total! Avoid booking tours thru the hotel as well. The breakfast is rediculously overpriced. The room was terrible both nights. A terrible overall experience. I left a review at the desk when checking out.

I am not one to complain but the service that I received at this hotel was beyond what I could take. I asked for a refrigerator in my room. The guy checking me in said it was arranged. An hour later, I was still waiting for one so I called the front desk and when I inquired about the status of the fridge, the front desk said they would check the status (in a very annoyed tone) then hung up on me. Another hour passes and since there were no return calls, I called again and was told me that they were trying to track one down and that I could leave the room and when I returned from dinner, there would be one there. Returning from dinner, there was still no fridge. So I called and was finally connected to a manager who then told me that there were no more fridges available. So why promise to provide me with something that you don't have? So the next morning, I went to the front desk in person to speak to someone. My leftovers from lunch and dinner had spoiled and there were still no answers. When I explained this to the General Manager, he apologized and offered to take $40 off my room. Even though that would not excuse the mix up, it compensated what I lost in my left overs. I thought everything was fine. The next morning (check out morning) I received an express/automatic check out. My bill was sent to my room and it was itemized. Instead of the promised $40 off... he only took off $35. I would never stay at this hotel again. They can't seem to keep any of their promises. If I book a room and it was promised that I would get a room. When I show up... Will I really get a room?

I was then put into a room that should have been \u201ctaken off market\u201d per the hotels GM the original issues with the room included a FILTHY, moldy gross tub, complete with hairy ceiling and walls, stained and buckled carpet, noisy door, and faulty HVAC. The GM contacted me apologetic and sent me a certificate for a 2 nights stay in a Jr. Suite for my troubles along with a reward card full of points that will allow me to stay at a discount at another hotel in the Starwood network. Long story short, months pass and I find myself traveling for business in LA again so I call over and over and over and over again trying to redeem my certificate. Left at least 5 voicemails and spoke to several different people in reservations who were unable to book the room. I should have cut my losses and kept it moving on to another hotel but apparently I am a glutton for punishment. I FINALLY find out after talking to at least 3 different people that the RESERVATIONS dept cant redeem the certificate it\u2019s the INTERNAL reservations dept that must do it\u2026 I left several more messages including one that just said here is my cert number, my name, date of my stay just book it for pete\u2019s sake\u2026 and it was NOT booked. Finally I got in touch with someone in the internal reservations dept, book my room and they again apologized for the inconvenience. Fast fwd to my arrival date. The day prior I called to CONFIRM that I would be arriving late the next day and to ensure that my room would be held\u2026 they assured me that it had been reserved. I arrived late after appointments in the city to an empty counter. I stood for 15+ minutes before someone arrived to go find the night auditor. The night auditor comes looks at my certificate and tells me that my room had been given away due to late checkin. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!! So I get a standard king room which should be nonsmoking but that smelled like an ashtray and was far away from being a SUITE and the MOMENT I fall asleep the FIRE ALARM goes off. I evacuate my room sleepy eyed and finally return to get some shut eye. Then the POWER goes out on one wall in the room. The wall of course with my charging cell phone and alarm clock so I overslept for my appointment the next morning. In the morning I go to the front desk to alert them of the power issue and they again apologize and move me to the suite I should have had in the first place. The suite I finally ended up in was newly remodeled and very nice, but what a fiasco. There are truly some systematic issues going on with the hotel, poor customer service on the phone, lack of personnel during late shifts, lack of communication and even in the new wing they find some sort of weird need to use old school STOPPERS for the tubs that are gross/discolored and outdated. Parking lot was full, rooms are poorly insulated so you can hear your neighbors making love, screaming babies and the whole shebang even in the new wing. On a positive note the pool looked inviting and the bed was comfy... avoid the restaurant with its $15 salads... that can easily be copped from a nearby McDonalds for 1/3 of the cost.

I almost forgot to mention the used band aid on the floor as well. There were no bathing towels in the room, nor was there any conditioner. Lastly, there was only decaf coffee in the room. I spoke to GIna, the manager, but unfortunately there were no more renovated rooms available. Problem is this was one of the reasons we chose this hotel. So, Gina offered to comp parking. This was nice but I would rather have had a nice room than free parking. She's working on getting me an additional night, at least, at no charge. I'll let everyone know what happens. Gina is very sweet and accomodating, just not a whole lot that could be done at this point. :-(", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse, New York", "Title": "\u201cShort But Sweet\u201d", "Author": "handee4", "ReviewID": "UR102309133", "Content": "Our stay was just an overnight to catch a plane the next morning.

I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, and booked a one-night stay at the Four Points Sheraton Hotel at the LAX International Airport for Saturday, October 9 2010. The purpose of the stay was because my elderly parents were flying into LAX on an International Overnight flight, which was scheduled to land at 6:00am. I live in San Diego, which is approximately a 2.5 hour drive from LAX. I decided to get a hotel so I could pick them up very early, then bring them back to shower and rest for a few hours before heading back to San Diego. Starwood hotels have always been of the highest quality, so I was excited to find a Four Points for only $75/night. Upon arrival at the hotel, there was a bit of a traffic jam entering/exiting the self parking area. This was due to a giant party at the hotel letting out, and 15-20 cars had parked in no parking areas along the sides, creating a one-lane only width in what should have been a 2-way traffic area. It took almost 30 minutes just to get in to park. We checked in, but were given absolutely no paperwork proving that fact. We were told we would be given a receipt upon checkout. We went to our room, (#223 on the 2nd floor). After calling Guest Services to order a wake-up call for 5:00am, we went to sleep. Luckily, I happened to set the metal security lock on the door before going to bed, because at 12:56am we were awakened by the sound of a key being inserted in the lock on our door, and a strange, random man trying to enter our room. When my husband said, \"May I help you?\" he was informed by the man that he had just checked in and been assigned this room. My husband told him to go back down to the counter, because we already had this room. We then tried to go back to sleep. I was unable to do so, as I was worried about our safety, so I lay awake all night long. This is how I know that our room, #223 is directly above the valet pull-up (which is also where the airport shuttle stops). Every 15 minutes, the shuttle pulls up and broadcasts a recorded message of \"Airport shuttle and Hilton, next stop.\" It was not exactly quiet and peaceful. At approximately 3:00am, some random person again tried to insert a key into our door. This time it did not open. Imagine my surprise when 5:00am rolled around, and no wake-up call came. Luckily I was still awake. At that point, my husband went downstairs to the front desk to complain about the dismal lack of service, quality and security. The woman at the desk expressed surprise that there were people in room #223, as apparently it had never been entered into the computer. So that when some other guest checked in at 12:30am, he was assigned our room. Our missing wake-up call had also never been entered into the system (no doubt due to the fact they didn't know anyone was in that room). She didn't even offer so much as an apology. This was the biggest waste of $102 I have ever spent (including parking). I would have gotten a better nights' sleep had I stayed home and woken up at 3:00am to drive to L.A. After this disgusting treatment, I sincerely hope to never again have to stay at a Starwood Hotel. I am shocked and apalled that such a thing could happen at a Starwood. The entire place should be bulldozed.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cDecent airport hotel -- poor wi-fi\u201d", "Author": "garfodie", "ReviewID": "UR83020305", "Content": "Visited Los Angeles County again, and stayed at the LAX Four Points for an evening. Shuttle buses from LAX and location are decent (it is, after all, an airport hotel). Self-parking is relatively expensive, but no more expensive than other airport hotels in the area.

If you are SPG Platinum, don't hold your breath for any benefits from this hotel, though. It appears that I had a non-renovated room (see SPG Plat), with a CRT TV, and a functional bed/bathroom format. The facilities (e,g. bathroom) are noticeably dated, but it wasn't grimy or anything. The room came with a fridge to store milk and groceries, if you wish. What bugged me the most of this hotel was my room's proximity to wi-fi -- while the signal was strong, it was very difficult to connect to a continuous session, which made business e-mails a challenge through VPN. Even surfing through web-pages was a challenge. I tried upstairs, lobby, netbook, and iPod touch -- all devices were a challenge to get service (though the lobby was slightly better). A pet peeve of mine is hotels that rely on wi-fi only for their Internet connection -- I'm willing to pay extra for a wired Ethernet connection, but if there's none available, the Wi-Fi had better be solid.

I was able to return my rental car and walk across the street to this hotel for a good night's sleep before my morning flight out. I followed suggestions in TripAdvisor and requested a renovated room in the central tower... and the furnishings and layout were fine. One thing that's a bit different is the windows look out onto a hallway which has exterior windows on the other side of the hall, rather than looking straight outside like normal windows. I worried a bit that foot traffic past the room would wake me up during the night, but it didn't. The folks at the front desk were extremely nice and very accommodating for check-in... a welcome touch after a long drive on California's freeways. While I was checking in, a group of about ten international flight attendants came in... this is obviously a busy airport hotel. There's a convenient (albeit a bit confusing) kiosk in the lobby where I was able to print out my boarding pass for the next day, and there's a Burger King across the street for fast food devotees. Complimentary wireless internet is available (thank you), but the signal is fairly weak (ranges from poor to good) so service is s-l-o-w. Apparently you can get faster service for a fee. Throughout the hotel staff are exceptionally nice... unusually so. Good hot breakfast buffet was included in price of my room... eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc. One pet peeve - the room bill was not left under the door at night so had to check out at front desk... waste of my time, especially since there was a bit of a hold-up at the front desk. Nice convenient shuttle service to LAX. I liked the idea of staying here on my last night of a trip to Los Angeles so I could turn in my rental car the night before departure, and have a relatively stress free trip to the airport... you'll need it once you get to LAX!!!

And while we're on the subject of the bathroom, it was barely larger than a coat closet and so uncomfortably small that my legs were knocking against the door and the bathtub when I had to use the toilet. (Too much info? MAYBE, but in case you want to know if you'll be comfortable, you most likely won't be in the bathroom.) I also didn't make a big deal of the fact that the pool had no water in it. Why bother? There is a whole entire ocean a couple blocks away. Personally, I think some of my disappointment comes from the fact that I read about the hotel on Trip Advisor and I knew that some of the rooms were being updated/remodeled. So I asked for an updated room, which the desk guy was really nice about giving me. But...if the one I got was an UPDATED one, I'd hate to see what the NON-updated ones looked like. The decor was like staying at someone's aunt's house who hadn't redecorated in years, and who also has bad taste. The comforter on my bed had a small stain, which was somewhat distasteful, but the sheets were always fresh and clean each day. The lobby is gorgeous and looks really high end, which is why it was surprising that the room was so motel-ish. Another point about the \"remodeled\" room that we were in...the rust on the door hinges in the bathroom was clearly obvious despite having a fresh coat of paint over it. The hallway carpet also had a big stain on it (stayed on the 5th floor). I don't know. Overall, it was decent, but the lobby made me expect something really nice, and the actual rest of the hotel was really not living up to that expectation. Staff was really nice and helpful. Parking costs $16 a day extra, so take that into consideration when comparing prices, if you'll be driving. Decent, industrial type neighborhood.

It was about $25-50 bucks cheaper than the surrounding hotels. I was excited that we were going to be staying at a Sheraton. When we arrived, the lobby was very nice, and the service at check-in was very pleasant. The front desk mgr checked us in, and told us that we would be in one of the renovated rooms. When the elevator arrived at the 5th floor, we were confused at where to go. Yes, there were arrows pointing to the numbered rooms, but they all pointed to exit doors that looked like stairwells. When we ventured through ours, we walked down a long, musty, smelly hall (not to mention the pot smell coming from one of the rooms). It was like a motel, large glass windows with pull down shades in each of the rooms, that you could look into as you walked by. There were no windows to the outside, other than across the hall. Once in the room, the furnishings were nice, (but the room was small). Not much room to move around if you had luggage. There were four of us, two adults and two teenage boys, each w/one suitcase and a backpack. Large flat screen tv, nice linens, nice wallpaper, nice desks (two), a single cup coffee maker & free wi-fi. The weird thing was the carpet. It was really old looking, but very clean looking (but didn't match).The bedding was nice and the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom sported new, modern fixtures. I'm glad we got one of the renovated rooms! This was NOT up to the standard of a Sheraton, and I am very surprised that they have allowed their brand to be associated with it. We also went to the restaurant, which, much to our relief was open until 1am. (We arrived after 10pm, starving!) The waiter kind of messed up our order, but he was quick to fix it and the food was delicious. The guest services desk was very helpful in holding our bags at no charge until for a few hours until we left to catch our next flight. The pool was 'under renovation' due to an 'emergency issue' according to the front desk, but they quickly advised that we would be able to access the pool at the Renaissance Hotel next door, as long as we showed them the Four Points business card. What was attractive was the free shuttle to/from the airport every twenty minutes. Overall, it was a place to sleep, but I would NOT be comfortable staying there had I been traveling alone.

Here are the details, the room was extremely outdated. The hallway in front of my room had buckled and sticky carpet. In the room was an old oak headboard, a filthy outdated bathtub with stained tiles, a waterstained and hairy stopper for the bathtub (YES I SAID A STOPPER!! OMG) and moldy caulking, hair stuck to the shower walls and ceiling, and the AC unit was EXTREMELY noisy cutting on and off throughout the night and waking me up with rattling noise. The bed was comfortable enough and the bedding clean and welcoming. I was told that the hotel was sold out so they were unable to move me to another room, so I took the stinking \"breakfast credit\" for my inconvenience. The breakfast was tasty once they bothered to refill the buffet (which took about 30 minutes of waiting). The staff however in the caf\u00e9 was extremely courteous and friendly, I did enjoy dining there and that was the highlight of my stay once everything was refilled. The room I was in (RM 366) according to the front desk should have been \"taken off the market\" but was put back on market apparently since the hotel was overbooked due to cancelled flights etc. The Entry way, lobby, restaurant and pool areas all looked newly remodeled and were gorgeous so at first sight I was impressed with the hotel. The hotel rooms are under construction so it appears I just happened to get a very outdated crappy and FILTHY room. I was VERY dissapointed! Although it was tasty, the breakfast didn't come close to making up for my crappy room... I have literally seen better rooms at a Motel 6! Now IT GETS BETTER... when I contacted the hotel for a refund, the answer was no but we will give you a complimentary 2 nights stay in a suite... sounds like a good deal right? NO, it took me reminding the Assistant GM 3 times to finally get the thing in the mail and her cover letter said the cert was only for a 1 nights stay. I was a bit alarmed so then read the cert, which then said 2 nights stay. However, before I could feel releived I read on and discovered that her letter was dated June 30th, 2010 and that the certificate EXPIRED June 29th, 2010. Granted I live in Indiana and don't own a time machine so how the heck am I supposed to use it? Not to mention the countless spelling and grammar errors found in the cover letter and on the certificate. I am like YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!

This time I had not stayed at the Four Points LAX for about a year. I arrived without a reservation and approached the front desk agent. I remembered him from pervious stays. Now here is the incredible part, with the thousands of guests that they see every week he also remembered me. Not just that but he remembered my favorite room. Wow! After a 500 mile drive I was tired and did not want to go anywhere so I went down to the hotel bar to get something to eat. The waiter also remembered me and brought me my favorite Germen beer. On a side note the hotel bar, Brewster's servers an incredibly large selection of beers from around the world. Ask for the beer menu, it is broken down by country of origin. The restaurant is currently being renovated but you can still get anything off the restaurant menu in the bar. The food is very good with large portions that could easily feed two. What makes this hotel stand out is the incredible staff. I often travel to LA on business and to visit relatives. Over the years I stayed at many of the hotels around LAX (and there are a lot of them). They are all about the same, as far as room size and amenities go.

Since her company paid for the hotel room during the class, for the first night we were there we had to make a separate reservation. Our flight from Honolulu arrived in LA at about 5:00 a.m. and even though we knew that maybe our room was not ready, we decided to try and check in. When we first arrived at the hotel, it was difficult trying to find a parking space in the \"check in\" parking spot. Even though there was a sign that said \"10 Minute Reserved Parking Space to Check In\", we found out no one really monitors this. We ended up parking in the \"No Parking Area\". When we went to the registration, the staff member greeting was okay. I understand it was very early, but try to have a little enthusiasm. The staff member said at the earliest a room would be available is 7:00 a.m. My wife and I left, ate breakfast, and came back at about 8:00 a.m. When we came back, a different staff member checked us in. At first he said the room was not ready, but for some reason he was able to get us a room. We were very happy until we got to the room. To get to some of the rooms at Four Points, once you get off the elevator, you have to go through a separate door that leads you to another part of the hotel. This room was located in this other section and when we entered the room, it was one of the smallest rooms I have ever been in. Even the cruise ships have bigger rooms. Since the room did not have a refrigerator and my wife needs one for her medication, we called for one. The refrigerator they brought up was one of the dorm -sized refrigerator and the only place to put the refrigerator was in back of the front door. This means that since the door opened into the room, it would always hit the refrigerator. In addition, the bathtub faucet was coming off, so everytime we pulled the lever to turn on the shower, the faucet seemed it was going to come off the wall. As for the noise, I'm not sure if we were tired from the red eye flight, but we could not hear the noise from the aircraft, even though the planes fly right above the hotel. The next day, my wife checked in and we got a different room. This time the room was located in the main building and it was much bigger. In fact the refrigerator could fit almost anyplace in the room. As for the location, there isn't much within walking distance. For eating places, there is a Burger King, but that's about it. Good thing we had a car to drive to various places. The hotel does have two laptop computers to use if you need to use the internet. The laptops are located in the lobby area, right across the front desk and it is locked to the desk. This was very convenient especially if you do not bring a computer. If we had to stay in the first room, I would never go back to the Four Points. But since the second room was a bigger improvement, I would consider staying there again.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cOnly to spend the night before early flight\u201d", "Author": "Pepetito", "ReviewID": "UR53994429", "Content": "Book it if you need to wake up early to catch a morning flight from LAX and if you find some promo rate like I did ($75).

The tub and shower were pretty nasty with soap scum as other posters have mentioned. The toilet kept running unless you worked it just right to make sure you had the tank flap positioned properly.

The rooms at the front which include 'Sheraton Preferred' floors in some cases face the street and in other cases face the pool or parking lot. Many, if not all, of the rooms in that building have been refurbished (2008) and are, in our experience, clean and reasonably well kept ( some omissions from housekeeping - odd towels or free gift 'cosmetic accessories' sometimes. They also have refrigerators, new 'comfort' beds, flat screen TVs, new 'IPod' clock/radios and cosmetic 'amenity packs'. However there are other rooms at the front, as described , with an outside corridor, which are less desirable. At the back of the hotel there is a tower block where, I understand, the rooms have not been refurbished. they are also smaller rooms and lack amenities such as a refrigerator and may have older TVs and beds. The elevators can be very slow. Our experience is that there are often good package deals available which can include parking and buffet breakfast all for $115. Otherwise, If you have a car, it can cost $16 a day extra without such a deal. The buffet breakfast ('Full American\") is a good deal at about $10 for two people within a package but $20 per person without. It usually compares favourably on price with all LAX hotels, especially on weekdays. Weekend rates elsewhere vary from $80 upwards with $150 a day upwards on weekdays - Four Points 'pay in advance' non-refundable is often less than $100 on weekdays and much lower at weekends.

But the room facility control is poor, I can say. I was once very tired after my trip, just to find that the bathtub faucet wasn't working, and it took a hell while for them to put me in another room. Also, there is something about the front desk and restaurant staffs. The control over them, I may say, is so poor. Say, wouldn't you be disturbed when you are having lunch in a restaurant, and the janitor decided it's time to vacuum clean the restaurant carpet?? Or, in what kind of hospitality training did the waiters join, that they casually LET THE PLATE FALLS DOWN onto the table from their hand (literally) when they serve our orders, or sarcastically commenting in a rude way when my father asked for the water to be replaced with one in a room temperature? Now, the front desk staffs were even ruder. Not all of them, though. Some are very polite, and some of them, wow, WHO WAS THE GUEST THERE?? We have this young woman taking care of our bills when we were checking out, and she kept on saying that we are billed for two rooms when we were only stayed in one. No matter how patiently I explained it to her over and over again, she persisted that we are to pay for the phone bills for the other room we didn't even step our feet in! \"Sir, you booked this room through tripadvisor under your name, and you use the phone, so you gotta pay for it,\" she said while waving the bill paper in front of me.

Driver was kind enough to \"turn off the bus's tracking system,\" go off his approved route, and drop me at Four Points. He said it wasn't a really safe place to walk and he was right--it wasn't a BAD neighborhood, but it was poorly lit and consisted of mainly alleys and backs of hotels or hotel parking garages with no pedestrians whatsoever. Check in at midnight was pretty seamless and fast. Hall directions out of elevator were totally misleading. I didn't expect there to be no exterior windows--your window faced out into the hallway, which had windows, so the room got some natural light. The room was as I expected, and identical to website and orbitz photos. Room was clean, and I liked the simple updated style (nice big flat-screen). Bed and linens were clean and bright white, good feather pillows too--I slept well. I got coffee, banana, and yogurt at the coffee bar (not complimentary--I think it cost me about $7). The solarium-type, large lounge was bright, spacious, and generously furnished with several t.v.'s and laptop ports. I told the concierge I needed a cab, and I was in a hurry. He told me it would be about 10 minutes (this surprised me because we were spitting-distance from the airport, and I expected them to be plentiful). He told me to \"sit right there\" on a specific couch--which I also thought was odd. I got antsy and walked outside for some fresh air. 8 feet from the door was a line of cabs--and I hopped in the first one which pulled right up the moment I came out. Obviously, the concierge wanted a friend to have the business (my driver agreed with this theory).

We stayed here for two nights prior to sailing on Carnival Cruise Lines and to do some sight seeing in Los Angeles prior to our cruise. We arrived right at check in time and were greeted by a friendly front desk clerk. We were checked in very quickly. In fact, all of the staff we encountered were friendly. A room was nice, modern, clean and well maintained. At first, I thought we had no bathroom. The door to that is to left of the main door but the bathroom is tucked away behind the closet wall. This is an interesting and great feature as it gives you a bit more room to move around. The bathroom itself was a bit small but at least was clean. The tiles on the walls and in the shower were showing some wear and tear and needed to be replaced. Someone tried that in the shower and used the wrong tint of white so it showed badly. Our bed was fine as they are always are at a Sheraton and the television was nice and big. The room was kept spotless by housekeeping. The lobby area can be very loud and crowded at times. This is due to very busy times with check-in, airline crews coming and going and the hotel also a popular place for meetings and parties. The food here is just average but there is not a whole lot to choose from in the area. The hotel itself has a restaurant where we had the breakfast buffet twice. It was your standard fare but not much to choose from and definitely not worth the $30 they charged us. There is a bar serving all kinds of beers from all over the world. This is actually quite good. You can also get food here as well as they have the same menu as the restaurant. Again, it was pricey and the quality just average. There is a Burger King across the street and we found a steak house in the Marriott across the street. That was fine but even more expensive than what the Sheraton had to offer. Since most people only stay here or night or maybe two, you\u2019ll survive. There is a pool here which was fine. Although, it was smaller than the picture shown on their website! It was clean and not too crowded. They also keep the water quite warm so you won\u2019t freeze when you get in. There is also a fitness adjacent to the pool which is well equipped but in a small room. We only took the free shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel. This took a while to show up. When it did, we discovered that one bus serves three different hotels. It was fine as we did make it to the Sheraton which isn\u2019t all that far away. If taking this to the airport, give yourself extra time as we saw a few instances of passengers being forced to wait for the next shuttle as the one that showed up was full. It\u2019s also not painted in Sheraton colors like other buses you\u2019ll find at other airports. The bus\u2019 destination sign in front will tell you what hotels that it stops at. Make sure you get on the right bus! If you are looking to do some sightseeing, take Sightseeing LA which provides bus tours. They will pick you up here and then bring you back. You can make reservations yourself or the hotel can arrange it for you. We took a full day tour and they are really great. Also, if you are going on a cruise like we did, here are a few pointers for getting to your ship. If you sail on a weekday, give yourself plenty of time due to traffic. We left on a Sunday so the traffic was light. Have the hotel book you a car to take you to your ship. It\u2019s the same price as a regular taxi but more reliable and comfortable. The cruise ports (there are two in LA) are about a 40 minute ride from here with no traffic. Overall, not a bad place to spend a night or two.

However upon getting off the lift we were bewildered as we could not find our room number indicated on the nearby walls and asked a staff member for assistance and they opened a rather shabby solid door to the external balcony. This resembled the setup of a Travelodge hotel elevated several floors and in going into the room and in being in a Travelodge this feels like a Travelodge with better furniture. The bathroom is quite dated and the carpet has been quite dilapidated and there were several visible stains. The room also had an unpleasant musty odor. Upon speaking to the manager he stated that as we booked through the website those rooms were the only ones assigned and if we wanted an upgrade it would cost significantly more and yet we paid $386 for 3 nights. The upgrade would give us a non balcony room, which would have represented a hotel rather than the motel that this establishemnt ufortunately is. We weighed up the facts and decided that we would rather spend money on clothes etc One morning my wife went downstairs to ask for a couple of glasses of milk to have with our prepurchased cereal and the lady brought them back within a minute asked for $4 for the milk and If she can have a tip. This was sharply refused especially as 5 minutes down the road you can buy a gallon of milk for $4.20. Naturally our room only had an ice bucket which can only fit one water bottle preventing any such purchases. Fridges we found are a rarity in the US hotels having seen only one in 25 days. The hotel offers two computers with free internet facility with a sign indicating 20 minutes per customer however the service desk is located within 10 metres and yet they allow people to stay there for considerable time whilst others are waiting. Rather than asking them to move the staff just chat to each other unaware of what is going on. The hotel like all others displays brochures of attractions, with cost savings etc. I asked the attendant where the Disney Land brochure was and he stated that they are popular and are all gone. No attempt was made to ask us about our length of stay or that he will organise for some brochures. I revisited the stand 3 days latter and naturally there were no Disney Land brochures. Finally we paid $36 for the three nights to park the car and we got lectured by the parking attendant who took a minute or so to let us off the lot stating that we should have had a pass which were not given instead of making a quick phone call and politely asking us to rectify. I am amazed at the rudenees exemplified - Does anyone train these people - How would they speak to the elderly?? Naturally there were no mention of alternative choices. This could have been better spend in other activities. The hotel is not near any food places. Upon coming into the US we stayed at the Radisson and upon reflection it is far superior to this as it is a hotel, has double glazed windows, extensive business centre on the lower floor as well as an extensive breakfast buffet, as well as a subway within a couple of minutes. As stated I was eager to book this hotel initially but in staying there I have come to the conclusion that there are much better and cheaper choices than this overrated upmarket Travelodge.

When I was checking out I settled the respective bill with cash (approximately $75), rather than having it charged to the credit card I have registered upon check-in. Before flying back to the uk I decided to take a few days in Las Vegas, where I stayed at the Hilton. I was initially alerted that there was an issue when I checked into the Las Vegas Hilton. The same card I had used in Los Angeles was 'rejected' as payment for the room. I immediately contacted my credit card company in the uk, who informed me that a charge of $750 had been made to the card by the Sheraton Four Points Hotel at LAX. This almost wiped out the remaining credit on the card, and as I did not have any other credit cards I was forced to use the limited cash I had on me, as a consequence I did not have the greatest two days in the city. I was unable to rent a car as had planned to do, plus I was also restricted to eating 'budget' food. After two days a security supervisor from the credit card company called to inform me that they had been in direct contact with the Four Points Hotel, and the customer services manager had confirmed that a desk clerk had been fired as a consequence of a number of thefts. When visitors settled their hotel accounts in cash (as I did) the offending desk clerk would simply charge the amount to the registered credit card, then pocket the cash ($750 in my case) When I reported the matter to the hotel they did not even apologise. However, after a number of letters and emails to the Starwood HQ they agreed that they would provide me with some level of 'compensation' which was in the form of either a free stay, or at least vouchers. It will shortly be the FOURTH anniversary of the stay and I have still not received any vouchers, or indeed any physical confirmation that I would be provided with a free stay upon my next trip to the United States. The reason this matter came to mind again is because I am flying out to Los Angeles later this month and I would like Starwood to provide me with what they promised. I have sent them two letters over the last few weeks but they have failed to respond to any of them. To say I am disappointed with the outcome of this matter would be an understatement. Not only was I the victim of theft, but the premeditated criminal actions of a Starwood Hotels employee robbed me of a relaxing stay in Las Vegas, and a trip to the Grand Canyon, which I had always dreamed of. Needless to say, I shall never stay with any of their hotels ever again, and I would like to warn all visitors of the possibility of becoming a victim of theft whenever you stay with Starwood Hotels.

On the night before and the night after the cruise, we stayed at this Sheraton. Beautiful hotel, comfy beds, clean rooms (we are very picky about cleanliness), great location. Never have we experienced such helpful staff.......I actually took down the names of the wonderful concierge staff so I could mention them.....Teresa, Jess and Miguel. They were WONDERFUL!! They made our two and a half days full of great things....arranging transportation to Santa Monica pier, arranging shuttles for us to Disneyland, printed out maps for us, confirmed reservations for us, and even went so far as to drive us themselves to a wonderful Mexican restaurant called Paco Taco's because they had so highly recommended it and wanted to save us the cab fare. Now that's impressive!! Check in was smooth and quick, we had two rooms booked on both nights as we were travelling with my motherinlaw. Rooms were great, large, clean, comfy, bright and modern. Lovely bedding. Airport shuttle was fast and easy picking us up at the airport and taking us back to the airport. Very friendly shuttle service. Close to many amenities, including some restaurants and very close to an easy to follow bus station. Cabs easy to find too. Super quick internet room always available. Friendly service in their very nice gift shop. Our only complaint was the restaurant. Service was by far the worst we have ever encountered, and we eat out in nice restaurants a lot. Food was mediocre. Service staff was so slow and incompetent, it was almost laughable. Skip the hotel's restaurant and have them take you to Paco Taco's or another restaurant. You will love the Sheraton Four Points at LAX....we sure did and will be staying there anytime we are in LA.

Don't worry, the parking lot is protected from intruders by gobs of razor wire and the lot is illuminated for your protection with the ambience of a fine gourmet restaurant. The lobby is quite nice and large. Check in was reasonable. I walked around looking for the elevator and had a look at the meeting rooms. They appeared to be above average. Up to my floor - 5th - and the worry sets in. Not too pretty of an approach to the room, and the entrance to my room was on a long porch exposed to the open air. Not a huge deal, but considering how this area had aged, it wasn't what I expected from a company with the Sheraton name behind it. The room was fine, nicer than the outside. Four Points is one of the many hotels trying to attract customers with comfortable beds. The bedding was very nice and the bed was comfortable - a plus.

You can even view your account balance, charges and check out of the room on the TV.

The location was excellent. Right at the airport between the runways but we never heard any of the aircraft from the room. We did however hear the neighbouring room slightly. There is a shuttle from LAX that goes every 15 minutes to the hotel and is free. Just look for the red hotel signs outside of the airport and wait specificly for the Hilton / Four Points Sheraton bus. It might take a while but it will show up so don't panic like we did. :) The Palm restaraunt had a daily buffet breakfast which was ok most of the time. The shrimp scampy dinner was probably the best we have had and is highly recommended. The staff at the restaurant were very friendly as they always seem to be in LA. Stay away from the VIP Star tours and get one of the independent tours. The VIP tours are inexpensive but they have so many people in the tour you get stuck on a set schedule. They pretty much flyby everything so taking pictures is almost impossible. Independent tours have way more flexibility in what you want to see and how long you stay at the sights although they cost more. It's the old saying, you get what you pay for. If you get to Universal Studios take the VIP tour. This is one step up from the Front Of The Line pass but I have been on this twice and it is the best there is. Sure it's $150 US but you get a dedicated guide, walk on and in the sets and get in front of the Front Of The Line people. :) Well worth it.

When we checked in, they couldn\u00b4t find our reservation at first, but after a call and a walk to the back office by the front disk girl, they checked us in. Traveling as a couple, we asked for a king non-smoking room and she didn\u00b4t objected. When we arrived at our floor we had troubles to find the room. We had to walk through a door that looked more like a door to (emergency) staircase than to the hallway to some guest rooms (see the picture). When we walked through that door it did not get any better. This is motel, was our first thought. The room doors and the painting looked worn. When we entered our room we had to find out that they gave us a two queen room which we found unacceptable. I called the front desk and they sad the our travel agency booked a two queen and that they are completely booked. There would be no possibility to switch rooms. I don\u00b4t believe that my agency booked this kind of room. They booked other hotels for this trip and they were all king rooms. Also they knew that we were having a vacation as a couple. I think it\u00b4s just the people from the Sheraton trying to fill there hotel and trying to get rid of the complaint. The room looks a bit bleak. Though it\u00b4s a motel-like arrangement there is the door with a window on the one side. The bathroom on the opposite sdte is not such a nice view.

I think we were a bit lucky that we got a room overlooking the pool and not the back parking lot. Speaking of the bathroom, i didn\u00b4t expect to have a rusty AC intake in a Sheraton property. The AC can be adjusted but proofed not to be efficient during our stay. They charge you $1.50 per local and toll free call (for the first 60min and 10ct/min after that), which is a rip off in my opinion. Internet Connection is wireless and for free but the speed sucks!

Since then I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza - a little more expensive, but definitely worth the extra $10-$15 .", "Date": "June 15, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d208191-Reviews-Four_Points_by_Sheraton_Los_Angeles_International_Airport-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$102 - $284*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">9750 Airport Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90045</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516029", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/52/2f/522f25ae322bcb46f8db24f5ed0073597large.jpg"}}
