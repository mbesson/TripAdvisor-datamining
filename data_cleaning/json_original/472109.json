We are a family of 4, including 2 older children (12 year olds). We wanted to all stay in 1 place and we quickly discovered that only a few hotels offered rooms which would accommodate our family. Fortunately, we got this place at the last minute on booking.com for a fair price, especially given that it was a spacious 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom place. It was clean and quiet, although there is construction on the street side which would have been loud during the day had our room been on that side. Ask for a room in the back of the building. The room was well equipped, although I wish it had a washer/dryer. They do have communal washers and it cost $4 to wash and the same to dry. The breakfast was excellent and offered variety for nearly everyone. No complaints there. Plus there is a food court across the street. We ate a couple.of meals there which were inexpensive in an otherwise expensive city. Finally it is a convenient location with several MRT stops within walking distance.

The space is small, and I didn't get that cozy feeling throughout my stay. In general, the place is well-equipped, the kitchen has enough utensils for basic cooking, the gym is decent, and the breakfast was basic. But you will get sick of it after awhile. The rooftop pool is quite nice as there were not many people utilizing it. A few comments about my stay: 1. Housekeeping - I wish the staff is more courteous, as there had been a couple of times while I was getting ready for work, the staff pressed the bell and said \"housekeeping\" and before I could even respond (less than 3 seconds), she already made attempt to open my door (the latch was closed, luckily). That saved me from embarrassment as I was not entirely decent at that time. Also, there was a time when they did not change the linen for 5 consecutive days (but to be fair I did not request for housekeeping on 2 days in between). And also they forgot to leave any towels after they took away the dirty towels, and I had to request for it. There is also one time when the aircond remote was hidden under the linen after they made the bed! I had to look around for it for awhile! 2. The oven in the kitchen was not working, I made my complaint, and they said they fixed it, but it was still not working when I tried to use it. 3. This is not really the place's fault, but the construction can be bothersome due to the noise and accessibility. Besides the comments above, I would say that the location is actually good to get around, there are 2 MRT station and one of them is Dhoby Ghout which is the main station with many lines which is about 10min walk, and Bras Basah station about 5mins walk. Plenty of bus stations around as well and getting taxi at the area is fairly easy. Food-wise, there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Especially if you are a muslim traveller, in the same building there is a halal nasi padang restaurant, which is quite famous among Malays in Singapore, 24-hour Indian restaurant just a block away and a halal chinese restaurant behind the block. There is also a mosque within the building. I think if they put more effort to improve on the services with a bit of refurb to the room, this place has potential especially once the mega-construction across the place is completed.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cOnly basics\u201d", "Author": "tuu32", "ReviewID": "UR123628148", "Content": "I had a one bedroom apartment.

I agree with the previous reviewers that it certainly is not luxurious but it was clean and had everything we needed. We wanted more space than just two hotel rooms for 2 adults and 2 kids, and a small apartment was what we were looking for. In that sense it was perfect. What I didn't like was that the apartment seemed a bit dark and that the bathrooms are not well-ventilated and smelled a bit damp, especially after the doors were closed all night. The one thing that did bug me was that the balcony light can't be turned off and the curtains don't close all the way in the master bedroom. Basic crockery is provided, and tea and coffee. Fruits, drinks and snacks can be bought from the 7-eleven across the street. The rooftop pool is great not only for the kids. There is a playground on the rooftop as well, though I would have used something more solid than glass for the barrier (quite scary for people afraid of heights). Breakfast was provided in our rate and was of acceptable quality and with sufficient choice. Again, if you are not expecting luxury then you won't be disappointed. There is construction going on in the road in front of the hotel but this is only during the day so it didn't bother us. Location-wise, it is excellent. Convenience stores and fast-food outlets (including Subway and Coffee Bean) are near by. Two MRT stations are within walking distance: Bras Basah station (2 minutes' walk) and Dhoby Ghaut a bit further up. The purple line from Dhoby Ghaut takes one to Harbourfront (Sentosa) in no time. Bras Basah is on the Circle Line which takes one to Clarke Quay. Also within walking distance is the National Museum, which is really worth a visit, especially on a rainy day.

We were intrigued with what Singapore could offer as a family holiday. We did our research before leaving as we always do and it paid off. We had a list long enough to cover our 10 days stay and more. We chose to stay at the Somerset Bencoolen serviced apartments due to having 3 loud boys and also it was more practical than getting two hotel rooms and cheaper. We stayed in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite and had an extra bed set up in the lounge area. It was well furnished and the beds were comfortable even the rollout. The bathrooms were substantial and all the little shampoos and niceties were supplied as well and even replaced. It had a well equipped kitchen with all the utensils required to cook and eat. A good sized fridge and microwave. The minimum stay I believe is 7 days so that needs to be taken into consideration before booking. The rooms were cleaned every day and the staff were very polite and helpful. The breakfast was a wonderful buffet breakfast so there was no need for us to go out for breakfast at all and the kids loved it which is saying something! Singapore is such a beautiful place. There is the shopping; the people; the zoo; Jurong Birdpark; Chinatown; Little India; Science and Technology museum; Snow City; Marina Bay; Singapore Flyer; 737 simulator; beautiful exquisite buildings to admire; Clark Quay; Boat Quay and of course Santosa Island with Universal Studios and various other attractions including the chairlift and luge it just goes on. We ran out of time to do everything and they are still building new things. There is an ice rink in the new section of Marina Bay with beautiful boutiques. We were 10 mins from the nearest railway station which is easy to use and you get a $SG1 refund on each ticket after use so it only costs $SG1 per trip or thereabouts. We loved it and our kids had the best time.

I hadn't a clue where this was and on a map, it looked like it was in a bit of a no-man's land between Orchard Rd and the marina front. How wrong I was. It simply couldn't have been a better located hotel. Within walking distance are 2 of Singapore's most interesting districts - Little India and Kampong Glam. Both worth a 10 min walk to sample some authentic Singaporean experiences - shops, markets, food, architecture. The hotel is also right in the middle of what Singapore is trying to brand as the 'Arts District' - so there are galleries, musuems and exhibitions all around you. Orchard Road for major shopping is about 10-15 mins away. Fort Canning Park is one of the nicest green spaces in Singapore and that is about 5 mins walk from the hotel. We found ourselves doing a lot of exploring on foot to get to know our new home city and found you could reach any of the touristy spots within a 30 min slow wander. Transport wise - 2 mins to Bras Basah MRT station on the Circle line. Not very useful to be honest but less than 10 mins away is Dhoby Ghaut which is one of, if not THE, main MRT interchange. You can access 3 of the 4 lines from here and go anywhere you want to. There is also a heap of buses on the corner of Bras Basah Road which will get you to the Financial District/Marina Front in about 10 mins. There's also a taxi rank right out the door so that comes in handy for getting around too. It's also right opposite a great, cheap, clean food centre - part of a well known chain called Kopitiam. If you are going to go there regularly then buy a card which you load up with cash and you will get 10% discount when you pay with that rather than cash. You will also find some of the cheapest beer in Singapore here too - large bottle of Tiger for SGD$5 vs small bottle of Tiger in a bar for SGD$12. If you are self-catering, then it's opposite a 7-Eleven for emergencies or there is a Cold Storage Supermarket in a place called POMO on the road that runs behind Bencoolen Street called Prinsep. There's also cafes, bars and some food places along this road too. Drinking wise - you can walk to a place called 'Chijmes' (big bar/restaurant complex) by walking along Bras Basah Road for about 10mins. There's lots of choice around you. The hotel itself is extremely dated - our 1 bedroom deluxe room was just about OK in size for 2 people but it was so dark and '80s' we found we had to escape the room as much as possible. Thank god for the great location! Hard to self cater too with just one frying pan and enormous stock pot. Plus our room had an adjoining door with next door and the cooking smells from their room would drift over to ours and linger for days. It really wasn't pleasant. Ended up buying tonnes of air fresheners. However, the hotel provided some great cable TV channels and free, reliable wi-fi so big thumbs up for that. The rooftop pool is simply stunning though with great views - especially over to the financial district. There is also a jacuzzi on the roof too but in the month we were there is only worked once. There is also a semi-decent gym and a cheap and fast laundry room. Other positives were the staff - very friendly and polite. Room was cleaned spotlessly everyday. Very unobtrusive service. Overall, it was a great introduction to living in Singapore. Shame about the hideous rooms. It really needs some renovating and then it will be an amazing place.

We have a 4 year old son and wanted him to have his own space and have the ability to put him to sleep and not have to go to sleep at the same time! We found this and much more at Somerset Bencoolen. The apartment (we stayed in a 2 bedroom one) was fantastic - modern, 2 bathrooms, great kitchen & lounge. Breakfast was provided every day in the dining room on the 5th floor. The pool area (on the roof) was fantastic with amazing views and a separate pool, spa and children's paddling pool and playground. Our 4 year old wanted to be in the pool almost every minute of the day! The staff were all exceedingly friendly and provided excellent service. The aprtments were close to transport and taxis were always coming past (max of about AU$5.00 to go most places). We walked to most places (even with a 4 year old in tow) so as you can tell it wasn't far from anything. My husband loved it due to its proximity to all the fishing stores in the Bugis area! Suffice to say we loved it and will certainly stay there again when we return to Singapore.", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Somerset Bencoolen", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d472109-Reviews-Somerset_Bencoolen-Singapore.html", "Price": "$210 - $286*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No. 51 Bencoolen Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">189630</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "472109", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2e/b7/2eb741444320c3e69bbbfb3eac1396ce5large.jpg"}}
