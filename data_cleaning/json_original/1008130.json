The room was quite nice (modern and simple), the bathroom has no place to put your soap or toiletries, decent room service and friendly front desk staff. My room had an ante-room that faced the back street. Clean and cosy. The breakfast was not good at all (watery scrambled eggs and dripping bacon). The coffee shop staff was efficient and very helpful. I would go there again but would try and negotiate the price a little bit. Oh yeah...not many TV channels that you can watch.

She told us to have our cases packed the next morning an come back in the afternoon at 3pm to make the move, which we did, when we arrived at reception she looked at us with a very puzzled expression and said she assumed we never wanted to move because we had put the clean room sign on the door (our cases were inside ready packed and ready to be moved!!) again she treated us like we were a pain and changed her tone whilst speaking in Spanish. We were eventually moved to a quiet room, and it must have been the worst in the hotel, but I did not hae the energy to complain.

The hotel is \"hidden\" in the very middle of Barcelona, with reception one floor up from street level. The entrance in convenient once you have registered, since the lift takes you straight to your floor level. The lobby is stylish and compact. There is no separate breakfast room; a part of the lobby is used for serving breakfast in the morning. Corridoors are simple, but when you open the room door, you get a surprise: extremely modern room where eveything is open including showers and toilet (which are behind a glass door each). Overall special. Breakfast was good and eveything fresh. There was a small hickup though: the room in which I was staying was booked and paid for over almost a week. I left early after three days and another person from our group arrived that day and he was going to stay in the room I stayed in. I left my Mac charger into the room for him to use, but when he arrived a few hours after I had left, the charger was gone. And the room had not been cleaned, so somebody must have entered the room, and taken the charger. I contacted the hotel and told them that I feel they are responsible for the loss, which they did not agree to. In a hotel of this quality should not happen!

Shops, restaurant or tapas bar, the luxury stores and of course the famous and always filled with tourist and locals alike, the Las Ramblas. Close to transport too, the Passeig de Gracia Metro, the bus stops and also taxi stands. The hotel has no lobby, when you arrived by taxi, if the taxi driver didn't point you where the entrance is, you'll be lost! The entrance (very small and narrow), is between Nike and Ermenegildo Zegna stores and has no sign ligthing. It is across the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. It has a locked sliding door and you would be stumped how you would get in, lucky for us, a couple was coming out. You will then be presented to 2 lifts and would have to read which floor is the reception area. The reception is on the first floor which is just outside the lift, no fancy reception desk just plain reception which also houses the breakfast area on the right. The hotel has 5 floors with 70 rooms of accomodation. It has a rooftop Jacuzzi which can fit 8 to 10 people at the same time and the fitness centre which is also small is beside the Jacuzzi. It has no swimming pool but there is an outdoor sitting area on the first floor on the left of the reception, which if I would design it is make this the reception lobby because nobody sits there anyway. The hotel comes with a free wifi-G and not the N type which is adequate. Our room, no 405, is average in size, Be careful after you enter the room, the floor has a step down and if you were in a tired mood, you'll miss it and hurt yourself. it has the street view. The shower room and toilet are separated with wall and has doors. There is no bath tub that is why I called it shower room. But the sinks, just like the other reviewer said maybe cute but uncomfortable. It has a shelf right above it and since they're so small, you'd be lucky not to hit your head while washing your face and also wet the floor. The toiletries are mninmal, it has soap, bath gel, very small box of tissue, shower cap, no shampoo, no conditioner and no lotion, only came with 1 toothbrush and 1 comb. You also don't get free bottled water. The room has no couch with only 1 chair. The desk don't have drawers, the wardrobe cabinet don't have drawers too, you'll have to make do of putting all your undies and t-shirts together beside the safe inside the cabinet. There are plenty of space to put in drawers inside the wardrobe cabinet but I guess, the designer don't want you to stay more than 1 or 2 days! There are also no hooks to hang your clothes and this hotel is not green because it does not encourage you to recycle your towel for second use because there is nowhere you can hang your used towel to dry. Not a lot of thought for the comfort of the customers was put it here. No idea who this room design is targetted for. The bed is comfortable and one good in the room is that there are plenty of powerpoint outlets. The breakfast is good with not a lot of choices. Salad, fruits, different small muffins, smoked salmon and beef, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs but no fried eggs and is almost the same everyday.

I'm a very seasoned traveler; I love the niceties but don't have to have them. But I payed $190-$308/night (almost $900 total for my 4 nights) and expected more for the money. THE PRO's first: - Terrific location, lovely upscale neighborhood, a block from Casa Batlio, a couple blocks from Le Pedrera. Three short blocks north of Placa de Catalunya, and walking distance to the Gothic Quarter, La Boqueria market, La Rambla, Palau de la Musica...Loved the location and neighborhood - Phillipe, at the front desk, was most helpful. He had all the answers to our questions, was happy to help us with directions and daily walking agendas, spoke perfect English and had a good sense of humor - The decor of the main (1st) floor was very cool, very \"mod\", very red - Our room had a nice little balcony overlooking the street, and very good windows, so no street noise when they were closed - The bed was comfortable - Jacuzzi deck on Floor 5 was nice The CONS: - The other front desk people were hardly helpful. When Phillipe was not around, they barely could give directions, advice, information - The SINKS in the room were ridiculous. There were two round sinks, each about 12\" in diameter (photo below), with a faucet dropping down in the middle. You couldn't wash your face WITHOUT GETTING WATER ALL OVER THE FLOOR. And my husband had the most difficult time shaving. They were just so impractical to use. They give you a tiny bar of soap (1\" square) but there was no where to put it except leave it tossed in the sink. And a very small shelf near the sink to place your toiletries etc, was very inconvenient - The lighting near the sink was poor. I appreciated the makeup mirror but there was no light shining on it, so it was really useless - Shower was OK, however they gave you ONLY a tube of shower gel. NO BATH SOAP, NO SHAMPOO OR CONDITIONER, NO LOTION. I can't recall EVER staying in a $200/night hotel without those simple amenities. - They were really stingy with towels. For the two of us, they gave us 2 bath towels and 1 hand towel daily (and no washcloths). And they were rough and old, far from fluffy or luxurious. - The toilet was basically free standing (frosted glass walls) and tiny. If you're at all large, it's a stretch to get in and out of the bathroom stall, as the door swings in and nearly touches the toilet. And don't think of getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom without waking your spouse. Or feeling like you have much privacy at all to use the loo. - The free internet connection was not secure (no password needed) and the connection was so slow, it was so frustrating. The best connection I could get on my laptop in my room in my 4 days there was \"48 MBPS, very slow\". - The room lighting was bizarre. There were small tube lights next to the bed, and no matter what we tried, they remained on on one side, tho very dim, though the night - The room was hot. We set it on 19C (and it would set no lower), but we never heard the A/C kick on, no matter what it was set on - There was no clock in the room - There was a desk chair in the room, but that was the only chair The design was too cool to be practical. Maybe if I was just there for one night, it would have been palatable, but not for 4 nights. Clearly, the negatives outweighed the positives, so we'll be staying elsewhere when we return next to Barcelona.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ramat Gan, Israel", "Title": "\u201cPrime location, but dissapointing\u201d", "Author": "ednago", "ReviewID": "UR119965204", "Content": "I will start with the good things: The location is just great: 3-4 min. walk to Placa catalunya and then the Ramblas, 1 min. walk from Casa Batlio and about 15-20 min. of (lazy) walk to the Segrada Familia. It's close to everything. The service was ok, and breakfast was good. There's a free WiFi everywhere in the hotel, and that's a big plus. The bad thing is that the stylish design is not backed up with actual thinking about the costumer who's using the room. The hot water in the shower came about 10 min. after I caved in and started a cold (and terrible) shower. I was with a group on business trip, and some complained about the same thing but some didn't, so it depends on the room. Also, the TV didn't work, and the A/C I tried to chancge from cool to heat didn't manage to do so, so I frozed a little. I had no street view. Personally, I think that the idea of an open bathroom with no walls and door in the middle of the room is horrible, but I didn't have it in my room - be careful to ask about it when you order. The tiny sinks maby cute, but not comfortable, and have a shelf right above them so you have to stick your head in to wash your face... the lamps by the bed are tiny spots of light. So what's I'm saying is this: a) The design is not something to count on. b) It really depends on wich room you get, because they are all different. c) Is the location worth it?

Had the usual choices of LeMeridien, several of the Eurostars, etc... and hopefully can provide you with a well balanced account as the reviews on TripA for this lodging border on two extremes. The location of this hotel is simply amazing. Located right on the Passeig de Gracia, you will be minutes away on foot from world class shopping like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, as well as markets and department stores (El Cortes Ingles) where you can buy daily amenities. La Rambla and the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya is only a safe and short walk away, but the hotel is located away from their hustle bustle, so noise and traffic is not a factor for your sleep. For the Gaudi buffs, Casa Battlo in on the next block, and Casa Mila is a few blocks away on the same street, saving you a lot of time in knocking out some of the most famous architectural high points of Barcelona. La Sagrada Familia is less than 10 euros away by taxi. The Metro station and the Hop on Hop off bus is a few seconds away on foot, as well. The hotel insulates itself from the street by having the lobby on a higher floor. The front desk manager Felipe is humorous, knowledgeable and professional. The bell captain was extremely courteous as well. Our room was well appointed with an LCD TV and a large round tub in room. The shower and toilet were in covered frosted glass stalls, so we did not think that privacy is an issue for a couple. If you are sharing a room with only a friend, you are indeed sleeping in the same room with the person, so we are not quite sure why there will be too much worries about toiletry functions behind a closed door. We read here about the lack of space for soaps, etc...but in reality, none of this was an issue. The room had a great deck, with chairs and table for a nice meal outdoors.The jacuzzi on the common deck was clean. Wifi worked. Overall, this is a boutique class hotel which can present a different experience than your usual Ritz Carlton or W or even LeMeridien. However, its pricing is significantly less than those hotels. Service is excellent, and the overall presentation is certain unique, yet functional enough for the seasoned travelers.

Let me get the positives out of the way. The hotel is ideally located in the center of things. The property is all quite modern and the staff is professional & accommodating. We stayed 5 nights in 2 different rooms (our choice). Bedding is comfortable and plenty of lighting in the large rooms. Rooms facing the back courtyard are dead quiet to the extent you can sleep with window open. Some rooms are quite large (floor 1-3), floor 4 rooms take interior space and give you instead a balcony that is quite large (perfect for a cup of coffee). Styling is quite modern. Internet is wireless and free. Small business center with printer. Now for the negatives. The bathroom is open to the room. I don't care how well you know someone, there is a desire for privacy. The dual sinks are stylish but functionally useless, there is no where to put your toiletries. The small size means you splash water everywhere. The room has some unique LED lighting and we could never fully turn it off (I ended up pulling the lightbulbs out). Finally, one Sunday morning, the maids made a huge racket starting at 8.30 in the morning. After a while it became obvious - they wanted the guests up and out.. This is not what you'd expect from this class of hotel. Would I tell you not to stay here? No. Would I tell you to see if there is something else in the neighborhood perhaps as an alternative. Yes.

And the location just cannot be beaten - I defy anyone to find a better placed hotel in Barcelona. There's a small but lovely roof terrace with jacuzzi and also a lovely garden area. I think you'll either love or hate this place but if you like chic, modern hotels and you can put up with a few impracticalities, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cdesign over practicality\u201d", "Author": "Anniemw", "ReviewID": "UR26003355", "Content": "I was very disappointed by this hotel and do not think it merits 5 stars There was no seperate bathroom indeed no bath, the loo was a glass cubicle with an ill fitting door and if one turned on the light during the night the whole room was illuminated. The shower cubicle also had an illfitting door and flooded every time, thus rendering the bath mat unusable and water pools all over the floor. The wash basins, without plugs, were so small with the tap above that using them was virtually impossible, especially for my husband shaving or rinsing ones teeth etc. Indeed frequently if the tap was turned on more than at 50% the water hit the bottom and spurted right out and over one. There was absolutely no space whatsoever for toiletries near the basins. One morning there was no water at all. Not even for the loo, this lasted for over an hour. The room was not made up until after 4.00pm, there was no turn down service or replacement of towels or soaking bathmat ready for the morning. The towels were thin and small and clearly rationed, there was no flannel, we were begrudgingly given 2 bathrobes - one in a tatty state when we requested them, they were not changed nor was the bedlinen. One bedside lamp was not working but loose off the wall. There was only one 'comfy' chair and very limited english based TV. (analogue only) The general hotel areas were very poor with no comfy lounge etc. service was difficcult to obtain. Receptions understanding of english was limited and I suspect some had limited spanish too. The only really good thing about this hotel was its location which was great!", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Dee28", "ReviewID": "UR25355328", "Content": "We stayed here for the first few nights of our honeymoon and loved it. We were a bit skeptical after the bad reviews on TA but it was one of the best places we stayed on our 6 week honeymoon. It was also one of the best value for money hotels. It cost about 25 Euro to get a taxi from the airport to the hotel. Next time we'd probably just jump on the train/bus that goes direct to Catalanya Square and get a taxi from there. The reception staff were really friendly. We were greeted with champagne at check-in as it was our honeymoon which I thought was a nice touch. The room was really spacious and ultra-trendy which is what we like. The bed was really comfortable and we had a great view out onto one of the most prestigious streets of Barcelona. The bath was awesome too and a nice place to relax after a days sightseeing in the cold. The free wifi is an added plus. The hotel's location is great. We hardly used the metro system as everything was within walking distance. We walked from the hotel to La Pedra, then to La Sangria Familia and the next day down Las Ramblas to the gothic quarter (about a 10-15 minute walk). There is a metro stop about 100m from the front door of the hotel if you want to use it. Make sure you eat at Cafe Cervecerria (see TA reviews) as this was the highlight of our trip. We would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there next time we visit Barcelona.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eurostars BCN Design", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1008130-Reviews-Eurostars_BCN_Design-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$219 - $551*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Passeig de Gracia 29</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08007</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1008130", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/98/53/9853a1eb988587ec9823e13d014dc6405large.jpg"}}
