I can understand that, but our toilet was not flushing correctly from the time we checked in. My husband fixed it a couple of times and then I called for maintenance on it. We had to wait a few hours until the maintenance person came in and my husband told him what was wrong with it but it still wasn't fixed. We called again for service on it and the person at the front desk said all she could do was write up a work order for it. We were actually checking out when the maintenance person asked if we wanted the toilet fixed, by that time I figured it wasn't my problem anymore. There is a sign in the bathroom stating if you want to reuse your towels to just hang them up, if you want fresh towels to leave them on the floor. We chose to reuse our bath and hand towels and left the wash clothes and bath mat on the floor. When we returned to the room after it had been cleaned all our towels were gone and nothing had been replaced. I saw a couple of housekeeping employees in the hall (with my hands dripping wet) and I asked them for towels. Apparently they didn't have them and would bring them later. It wasn't very long before the towels were delivered but they weren't folded. I know this is a small matter, but I found it odd. It was several hours later that a bath mat was delivered. The safety lock on our door was broken and the door didn't seem to fit the frame correctly. You could see a good bit of light all around the door from the hallway. We were going to eat dinner at Damon's inside the hotel, but it took 20 minutes and asking twice before we ever got a menu. We were then in a bit of a time crunch, so we just ordered a salad to go. The restaurant didn't appear to be too busy so I'm not sure what the service delay was. The salad was tasty and fresh. The hot breakfast included with the price of the room consisted of scrambled eggs, sausage links, bagels that they ran out of, toast, cold cereal, milk, coffee, water and Tang (or some other orange flavored drink mix). The eggs and sausage were nice, but I was really wishing for some type of fruit or yogurt.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vincennes, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel I've ever stayed at\u201d", "Author": "Christina P", "ReviewID": "UR125284075", "Content": "To start off, we called the hotel to confirm our reservation and were on hold for 43 minutes!

Every week my key card had to be re-activated due to the guest service counter thinking that I had checked out. The room(s) 607 and 531 were beyond horrible. The curtains were stained, the carpet was in dire need of a cleaing and the ice machine did not work. The elevators tend to stop in-between floors and one elevator is comletely shut down for some reason. The \"free breakfast\" was apparently not included in my contractual obligations because guest services simply informed me that I wasn't able to eat anything because it wasn't in the contract. I found a sign/card in my bed under the sheet that stated if I wanted to do my part in protecting the environment then I would just place this card outside the door so that hotel service(s) will no I wish my bed linens to be changed. They did offer free internet for me due to my contract but it was so slow I couldn't even get a facebook game to load. Also, I was forced into having a roommate and well lets just say that the guest service staff, Ryan, refused to accomodate a room change even though this other guest was clearly sick beyond function. This poor guy was so sick I could \"feel\" the sickness without stepping across the threshold. My first night I slept in my van. The next day my key card didn't work. I went to guest services and they informed me that because the roommate was no longer in the room it was policy to deactivate all key cards associated with that room. That does make some sense. However, when I acutally entered the room I found all of this other man's stuff still there. He had clothes, personal items, food, etc. all over the room. I went right back down to the front desk to inform them of the situation. Mr. Ryan looked shocked-he opened his mouth slightly, then muttered I had no idea his stuff was still there. I informed him that there was some very personal items with delicate information just sitting up there and that I wasn't comfortable being in the room with all of that stuff. One reason for the liability of his personal information being available for me to see and second, I had no idea what made that man so sick! It took the better part of the afternoon/evening for the seemingly un-professional housekeeping staff to clean out the room. I wound up sleeping another night in my van. The next day guess what happened-my key card didn't work again. Lets just say that Ryan and I got to know each other very well from that point onward. I was approached by another guess that informed me that they were switching rooms because of a possible bed-bug infestation, though I could find no evidence in my room(s). He did apoligize for the issue and quickly re-activated my key card. I was actually looking forward to staying in a room that night, but I was quickly wishing that I wasn't. The hotel was having air conditioning issues and well my floor didn't have any air conditioning. All the unit did was blow around the hot air that was already in the room. This continued on and off-again for the rest of my stay, a period of three and half weeks. I have stayed in a number of different hotels all around the world and I can say without any doubt in my mind that it would only be doing the Ramada family of hotels justice if they demolished this particular hotel. The staff needs to be trained in proper customer service/appeciation skills; Room presentation/upkeep; General maint. issues/repair; General property upkeep/presentation.

There was a wedding party there on Saturday and never heard anything from them. I used the indoor pool and it was warm & clean. The hot tub was on the fritz but u could still sit in it and enjoy the warm water. The only thing that I wasn't happy about was that I was given a breakfast voucher to use the next day at the Damons restaurant it said that there was a breakfast buffet on the weekend. I went down at 8:30 a.m. with my daughter & niece and was shown to a table near the buffet when i asked what there was he said I had to order. The voucher said the buffet was from 5:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. I was disgusted so we went down the block to McDonalds. I got up Sunday morning and went back down to Damons when I talked to the hostess she informed me there wasn't a buffet on Saturdays only on Sunday we did stay and eat. They had bisquits & gravy, scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage & bacon. They had an omlet station set up but nobody there to make you one. The food was good & the hostess wrote us a new voucher to use to get our free breakfast.

Skip the restaurant in the hotel, Damon's: The staff seemed in disarray when we arrived around 7 p.m., and the speakers at the table didn't work. The mildest bar-b-q chicken wings served in the Damon's restaurant were so spicy my 10 year-old, who eats wings all the time, could not eat them. I told the waitress who told the manager but only the waitress said, \"Sorry,\" and nothing more was done.
