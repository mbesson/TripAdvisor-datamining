The staff was very friendly. That was the good stuff! Now for the dig: As the title of the review indicates there was not much rest to be had. Here was the issue - we walked into the room and it was a little stuffy and warm. Within a minute the air conditioner turned on and the room cooled down. Whenever the compressor turned off so did the fan (usually there are settings on the AC that allow the fan to run continuously thereby keeping the air flowing and the constant hum makes for a good night's sleep). This AC had no such setting (kind of - explanation to follow). So, all night long the AC would turn on and we would get cold and turn off and we would get hot. We actually set the thermostat to 65 degrees to achieve some kind of balance. The second night we found the setting on the thermostat for the fan to run constantly - hooray! Not so fast. Same thing happened as the previous night except that when I would get up to check the thermostat the AC would turn on. EVERY TIME! It appears that there is a sensor that senses motion and turns on the AC (remember what happened when we first walked into the room). There was no way to keep the air circulating. Upon complaining to management they said that the AC was designed to turn off for 2 minutes every so often to keep it from freezing up. Running just the fan does not make the AC freeze up. They denied that there was a motion sensor controlling the AC. Coincidence that every time I got out of bed the AC turned on? Coincidence that every time we walked into the room the AC turned on? Enough about that. The reason we stayed at this hotel was that it was among the newest in the Daytona area. I can guarantee that we will not come back here. Besides the issue mentioned above, there is also no place to eat nearby. We found a few restaurants but there was some travel involved. They have a restaurant that is part of Holiday Inn but it tends to be pricey. Also the only way you can get a free continental breakfast is by being a Priority Club member and that will get you 2 breakfasts per day (if there are more in your party that's just too bad). If these concerns do not trouble you then enjoy your stay here.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Skillman, NJ", "Title": "\u201cAce\u201d", "Author": "CVCCpro", "ReviewID": "UR128875221", "Content": "I tried this Holiday Inn in 2011 and returned with 4 of my golf schools that I conduct at LPGA.

The first night I was in a regular room, the second night I switched to the pull out in a friend's suite-room. Check in was very easy. They had room keys already coded for you. Very cool, you just showed ID, provided a Credit Card for Security (Never been anywhere where I didn't) and I was handed the booklet that had my name on it, and card inside with the FREE WI-FI code. FREE WIFI!. I've stayed at places that want to charge as much as $30 for Wi-Fi, its so nice when places see it as an added value, not a random revenue stream. The two queen bed room I stayed in the first day was very clean, and had a south east facing view toward the Speedway. Morning sun was bright this time of year if your not an AM person I suggest the Blackout curtains that are on a separate track from the sheer curtains (Nice touch having two types.) There was a desk to get work done, with a note that stated they had at the front desk Wifi Adapters if you needed one. This place is setup for business travelers and its nice to have access to local number and 800 numbers for free *Plus the wi-fi. Room came with a very nice iron that quickly moved through the packing wrinkles on my outfits. Bathroom was clean functional and spacious for a hotel bathroom. (It might even be larger then the bathroom in some apartments I've had.) What really made the stay was the \"extra touches\" done by the staff. As stated I was in town for a wedding. The bride and groom suggested the hotel and they worked with the staff to place personalized notes in each persons room that was attending the wedding. I was shocked to have one as I did not book this room until 4:00 A.M. the morning of my stay! That made the trip right there. They had worked with the staff & bartender to ensure their guests would be well taken care of, Megan the bartender was great in addition to being friendly and helpful to our large bar party even stayed a little late to ensure our full satisfaction! I checked out the workout area and was very nice and a step above the normal treadmill and lat pull down bar I've seen at most hotels. Keycard are awesome and use NFC. Every fiddle with your keycard trying to figure out the right direction to apply it, have that magnetic strip worn off? Battle with the door to gain entry in your room? Not here! They use NFC. Slip this card in your wallet and you're never going to lose it (unless you lose your wallet.) Get back to your room, waive your wallet (or card) near the door and it unlocks! Worried about security of this feature? Don't its harder the magnetic tech to forge a room key based on the coding of the locks. Its like that ID badge at work, or to enter your apartment complex. Here is the best part! I accidentally left my sunglasses in the lobby late Saturday night. I called up three days later. Spoke with the front desk, they took my name and number. Within ten minutes they called me back with wonderful news, they found my glasses.

The hot tub isn't really hot, but it is loaded with chlorine, so don't bring one of your favorite bathing suits.

We've also eaten at restaurants where breakfast or lunch typically costs about $30 and dinner might average $75 (tops being maybe $250). So that's our background for judging places. We were forced by driving rain and hail to make it an early night at this Holiday Inn (after having a great time at Kennedy Space Center). It looks a bit above average from the outside. It's even better inside. The room was clean, bigger than we expected, and cost about $70 after either the AAA or AARP discount. Since we travel after Labor Day, I don't know what the rate for a room with two queen beds (like ours) would be, but that's what we paid. The pool was small but clean. The hot tub next to it was the same. The staff was very pleasant. The whole place just had a comfortable feel to it, despite being booked up due to a nearby tennis tournament. An even bigger surprise was the restaurant just off their lobby. My brother had salmon. I had a steak and crab cake combination. I'm not an expert food reviewer, but he liked his salmon, the salads were fresh, the carrots and aspargus crisp and hot, the steak was marinated in something that added nicely to the flavor ... and it was cooked the way I asked for it -- juicy light pink on the inside, seared on the outside. The crab cake was very good. Not the best I've ever had, having eaten many crab cakes in Maryland and having had some sensational ones on St. Pete's beach not long ago. But again, this crab cake was perfectly acceptable. The server was new, but was learning fast and trying very hard. She'll have it down by the time anyone reads this. Since there were few people at this nice restaurant, I asked the hotel staff about it. They said the chef was quite new and had changed much about it. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone in the area or passing through. (The chef did come out twice to check on how we were doing. Perhaps he did so because he knew of the server's inexperience, but he seemed genuinely interested in what we thought.) So that's it. My first review.

Watch out groups, this hotel is double charging by using the guise of needing a credit card for incidentals. Be sure to check your charges carefully.

I have called for two days, left messages with both the person in charge of reversing charges and with the general manager. No one has bothered to return my call.

There were a couple of things that went a bit awry for my stay. I booked the Executive Suite in March 2010 for my Feb 2011 stay since I needed a room that held at least 5 ppl, especially during Daytona 500 NASCAR weekend. When I attempted to check in at 2/2:30 upon arrival, the very sweet and pleasant front desk attendant, said my executive sweet many not be ready (which she ran up to check). It wasnt due to a short-staff issue with housekeeping. I was told to come back in about an 1hr to 1.5 hrs to check in.OK no problem, I left and returned. When I returned I was told my Executive Suite was given to someone else and I was moved to a Standard Guest room. Even though my room was downgraded, the price was only $50 less than my premuim for the larger room. Why was I downgraded? Front desk mgr said \"She was out for a few days and this seems to be happening to a few guests while she was gone\" I had no choice but to accept the downgraded room (however, since only 2 ppl could stay in here, the rest of my party found a hotel about 45 mins away from Daytona and stayed there!) Not happy, but I didn't have much choice. (NOTE, I even called ONE MONTH prior to my stay to confirm my reservation and my room type...obviously that proved to be pointless) Once checked in and in my room, the previous guest bathroom garbage was still there. REALLY??! At this point, I was tired and did not feel like 'complaining' so I disposed of the remanant garbage myself. Not an ideal thing, but ok. The room was very clean and nice - typical standard 2 queen bed room. It was nice to have a mini fridge and microwave in case we needed it. Beds were very clean, pillows were small, but with the 4 or 5 on each bed, it made up for it! A few other reviewers noted the internet not working. And guess what...IT WASNT working for us either. I did call down to front desk also, and they suggested since th WiFi wasnt working, use the ethernet cable. HAHA, that didn't work either. When I went down to the front desk, she said she would have the manager reach out to us to remedy the issue, or at least see what the issue was. Guess what, we stayed there 3 nights and NO ONE attempted to contact us about the non working internet. I will say however, my brother who is in IT, figured out if you go directly to the entrance of your room, WiFi worked like a charm..but once in the interior, DEAD ZONE. I ended up buying a Hotspot while there for internet usage. Front desk mgr was REALLY nice about the lack of internet working for us, because on my last night there, she discounted the rate for that evening (thanks Carri). Overall, it's a very nice property to stay at. Safe, VERY CLEAN and great location. What I did not like was (1) previous guest garbage (2) non-working internet in my room and (3) which is the BIGGEST issue is being re-booked into a room totally opposite of what what my reservation had. I dont understand how my room could be 'given' away to a guest that arrived the same day I did, and merely requested a 'larger' room, while I RESERVED the suite at a high premium. I did write into the IHG/Priority Club Guest Relations, who advised within 48 hours the General Manager or Owner of the Property would call me to discuss. Guess what, that was 5 days ago, and I haven't heard from anyone. Advice to potential customers: if you need internet, have a hotspot or teeter off of your mobile device. AND call to make sure your reserved room type is CONFIRMED AND BLOCKED OFF (so your reservation won't be trumped and you wont be downgraded). I would still go back..but much smarter my next time around.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stamford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel overall\u201d", "Author": "lilums", "ReviewID": "UR94994105", "Content": "Stayed here for family funeral/visit - location right off I95 so convenient if driving down.

But very disappointed internet in room didn't work but maybe 15 minutes total all week. Front desk gave us ethernet cable but that didn't solve problem - we didn't have problem at other hotels this week so not our laptop. Staff did say system being upgraded but for 5 days? Otherwise I find Holiday Inns a good place to say if it weren't for the sheets. Also bathtub has not traction at all so slippery but many hotels are like that I find. Noisy people in nearby rooms a few nights, slamming doors and kids running in halls - after 9 pm - wish staff had noticed and said something but I guess they can't control all the guests.

Upon check out, the manager asked if we were playing golf that day and provided us with an additional discount for the LPGA course. The location was perfect, we were 5 minutes away from the course. The only negative was the air conditioner in the room, it sounded like a jet engine everytime it started up and ran. We told the manager about it at check out.
