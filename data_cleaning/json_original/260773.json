I have extensive experience with hotels in Europe and the USA and this is by far one of my worst choices. Besides the location, that is good, we got an unbelievably small room so our trolley for the child had to be kept in front of the room in the corridor. The room was really ridiculous with a tiny bathroom separated by a sliding wooden door (no privacy at all). I guess that for a couple the hotel might do fine (I doubt it though) but I would really NOT recommend it to people with children. The staff was very formal and unkind at times, so I was stunned when I remembered the reviews I have read concerning the staff being pleasant and helpful. The price was not cheap at all (over 100 euros per night) and the city tax was not included in the price (additional 12 euros for 3 nights for 3 people). The breakfast is miserable (coffee good though) and the breakfast is taking place in an improvised corridor in front of four other rooms (I never figured out whether those rooms belong to this hotel). The reception desk is far apart from the rooms, and the elevator that takes you to the rooms is very tiny and claustrophobic (not really a problem per se). All in all, too expensive, ridiculously small rooms, old and ugly furniture, nothing Italian and stylish. Would NOT recommend it (maybe for half the price) and especially not to people with children.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "denmark", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel at Termini\u201d", "Author": "Rosingfamily", "ReviewID": "UR92366282", "Content": "This is a little hotel - but a lovely one.

Actually, it is not a hotel... it's a pansion I think or something like that. The rooms are clean without any luxury. The important is that you hold your room keys all day long. The bathroom is very small but that was not a problem. The region (termini station) is of bad reputation but it's the best start to explore rome. Overall, the hotel is clean and value for money.

We were directed to this hotel after another hotel cancelled our reservation. We were assured that this hotel was of similar quality and in an area close to the train station. When we arrived the man behind the desk was arguing with a previous guest about their bill and refusing to take a credit card for payment. When we spoke with the clerk/owner, he demanded payment in full up front. This should have been our clue to leave. We ended up paying because we couldn't find any other rooms even close to our price range. We paid 120 euros/night. After spending one night in the room, we were ready to leave. The shower had no water pressure and would not drain. The toilet wouldn't flush properly (it tok 4-6 flushes just to get some toilet paper to go down, much less anything else). The cups at the sink had a white crust on them and the halls smelled like a dirty nursing home. We complained to the front desk and were assured that it would be looked into. upon our return that night, we found no change in the plumbing for the bathroom. Also, don't let the pictures fool you. They are taken with a \"fish-eye\" lens. The rooms are barely big enough for the bed. we had about two feet of space around the bed. There is no direct dial telephone. you have to call the reception and give them the number to call. If it is after midnight, then you have a different extension to dial and hope that it wakes someone up so they can place the call for you. In closing, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone no matter how desperate you might be.", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey City, NJ", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for low-maintenance types\u201d", "Author": "Stinger296", "ReviewID": "UR2587889", "Content": "This place was great. The staff spoke english well and were very friendly. The location is excellent, right near the train station with Metro access. Also, across the street is an internet and phone cafe.

There was another bedroom and a shared kitchen, living room and bath and a terrace (it was the top floor). It was very nice. The sheets, bathroom, etc were clean. The second night I stayed in the room I booked. It was spartan in style, just a bed, sink and closet. The bathroom was off the hallway shared by 2 other rooms. For each room I had 4 keys, one for the main door off the street, another for the hallway door, one for the room and one for the bathroom. There was never an issue sharing the bathrooms. It seemed everyone else staying there did the same thing I did, and spent very little waking time in the hotel.
