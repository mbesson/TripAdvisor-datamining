I stayed 1,5 hour more after 12 o'clock for 10 USD agreed before, but at check out they asked 25 Euro, started to shout, to speak not nice, making me to call the police.

The room itself was clean, bathroom was newly renovated. My window view backed directly across an alley to another building so not a great view but I barely spent any time in the room so I didn't mind. The best thing about the Bilinc is its location.

Breakfast is typically turkish with nice fresh bread, cheese, olives, cucumber & tomato which I love! There was free wifi if you take your own laptop or there was a pc you could use in the breakfast room free of charge. Location wise there are lots of clothes shops in the surrounding area and several restaurants, it is a 5-10 min wa lk to the Grand Bazaar and the nearest tram stop. To the central sights of Sultanamhet it is about a 15 min walk and there are lots and lots of restaurants there too. Istanbul was a great place to spend Christmas. We also used the transfer service from Sabiha Gochen airport to the hotel as recommended on the Istanbul forum and it was great for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 each.
