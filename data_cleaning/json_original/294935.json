The hotel could not be better placed for visiting all of the main attractions in the Sultanahmet area and is situated very close to the main tram line. You will soon get used to the \"daily calls to prayer\" one of which is around 5:15 am each morning, but we were sufficiently fast asleep most mornings to miss it! The hotel staff are very attentive, helpful, and polite and the hotel itself is very well appointed and has a roof terrace and restaurant from where you can see the Agia Sophia and the \"Blue Mosque! The rooms are perfectly adequate, comfortable, clean and have tea and coffee making facilities. There is also a fridge. The superior rooms have a safe, but if you book a standard room you will have to use the free safety deposit box facility adjacent to the reception area. The hotel breakfast was excellent and had a considerable range of options. We also ate in the hotel roof top restaurant a few times and were not disappointed. There are plenty restaurants on the doorstep and you will be spoiled for choice. A few doors from the hotel there is \"The Antiique Gallery Restaurant\" and each time you pass you will have to run the gauntlet from Ali who will entice you in for a meal every time you pass. The food there is very good, but watch out for some of the \"extras\" which are put before you, and also the multiple glasses of Raki which will end up on your bill if you are not careful. Also a few doors along in Yerebatan Caddesi there are two other excellent restaurants, \"The Kybele Hotel & restaurant\" and the Baran Fish Restaurant. Within walking distance there is also Sirevi and Amedros, both of which are highly rated by Tripadvisor contributors. If you wish to save some time and money and you are staying in Istanbul for several days it will be well worthwhile purchasing an Istanbul museum card either for 48 hours of 72 hours. You can purchase this a few doors along from the hotel at a travel agent. This could save you time and money and enable you to avoid queuing at some of the places such as the Agia Sophia.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hillsborough ca", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful Istanbul home convenient to everything\u201d", "Author": "706marylm", "ReviewID": "UR127838684", "Content": "We had a brief 2 night stay here and wished we could have stayed longer.

Please be aware that we stayed in \"Superior\"-grade rooms at the Celal, our rating above relate to that level of room. We have no experience with any other grade at the Celal. We found the staff to be excellent and helpful. Their english was excellent at all times of the day or night and their friendliness was warm and heartfelt. Like many hotels in Europe, they sold tours packages and we were very satisfied with the tours recommended. The breakfast was excellent and the wait staff friendly and accommodating. The roof-top terrace is unequaled in both it's view of Aya Sofia and the excellent service provided by both the bar staff and the restaurant staff (which is also located on the roof-top). We found everyone to be very gracious and kind to our 82-year-old parents traveling with us and we really appreciated the great service.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cAn Excellent Choice for Your Stay in the Sultanhamet\u201d", "Author": "Saavytraveler44", "ReviewID": "UR80352387", "Content": "Our group included my spouse and another couple.

Arriving from Bergen, Norway in late oktober, is was really nice with a temperaturs above 20 C. Located in the heart of Istanbuls old town, Celal Sultan hotel was a perfect startingpoint to see all the historical places. You can view the impressive Hagia Sophia from the rooftop and also from some of the rooms. The hotel is just minutes away from the blue mosqe, Topkapi palace, Yerebatan sisterne and the great Bazar. From Calal you are also sorrounded with exellent restaurants and the athmosphere in the old town is really relaxing. We also tried out some good waterpipe-places nearby and the Cerbalitas Haman turcish bath. Both 5-10 minutes walking distance from the hotel. We also went to the new town and the Asian side. 2 minutes walk, and the tram will take you to Taksim, Galatabridge and boats. (If you are interested in soccer you can find a English pub near the Tram, with English prices though) I was lucky to get tickets for the clash between Fenerbache and Galatasaray. What a match!! Seated with the Fenerbachefans in the 3-1 win was a great experience. Thank you so much for the ticket Serdar Guzelce :)The staff was Galatasaray and Besiktas fans, and I enjoyed talking about football with them. We ate lunch and dinner out, but we found the breakfast really good. Not fettish and greasy but clean and fresh bread, fruits and vegetables. The room was clean and it was really quiet at night. I think we paid around 930 Euro for 3 persons for one week, wich is not bad for this hotel. This was my second time in Istanbul. The first time I stayed at a big hotel without charme and athmosphere.

We booked one of the two suites in the hotel, specifically the one with the balcony with the view of the Haghia Sophia shown on the website. The room and bathroom were a comfortable size, with the bathroom having double sinks. Note that the suite has a claw foot-type bathtub, and while it may sound romantic, it is difficult to take an American-style shower in it. Although there was a plastic curtain around the tub, it did not completely close, which really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem since the shower was only hand-held. The hand-held part did not slide up and down on a pole, so the only way to spray water over your head was to hold it there. The real problem, however, was that there was nowhere within the tub to set your shampoo, razor, or even your soap, so it meant popping your head in and out of the shower curtain to grab and replace the items on the counter. It was not the greatest setup in an otherwise good room. Looking on the hotel website now, it seems that the lower-category rooms have more standard, American-style showers with shower heads. Again, lesson learned from this trip to Turkey--the best (and generally most-expensive) room doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always have the most standard amenities that we are looking for. But again, location can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat! The buffet breakfast was nice, but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bowled over like some other posters have written.

We had booked 2 twin bedded rooms but for some reason one was only available on arrival so two of us were upgraded to a junior suite where there was room to install another bed and all this was done in 5 mins & with a smile! The standard rooms are smaller than UK hotels ( this is the case in most Istanbul hotels) but they are well decorated and comfortable with excellent en-suite facilities. We stayed 3 nights specifically for sightseeing before flying to friend's house near Bodrum and had no complaints. The 'boys' on reception (we are old age pensioners so they seemed like boys to us) were very patient and helpful, answering questions on almost anything and advising us on best 'value for money' trips etc. Lovely hotel and excellent value for money.

We were a little disappointed with the size of our room. A little pokey (402) but for a long weekend it was ok. Immaculately clean and a lovely comfy bed. We slept like logs every night. Until 5am when you are called to prayer from the mosques nearby. But we loved that it, was slightly eerie but all part of the experience! On arrival we had a lovely basket of fresh fruit in our room. That was a lovely touch. Be careful also, as I got an electric shock from the socket in the bathroom as they haven't quite caught up with Health and Safety in Turkey! We had a private taxi back to our airport that the hotel arranged. That was really nice and much better than a taxi to Taksim square and then catching the bus.

The room was very clean and of a good size for a hotel in Istanbul. Even though our room was right next to the lift we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear it at all as it was so quiet (this really surprised us). Although we didn't get a room with a view, the window let in plenty of light and fresh air. The heating in the room was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very easy to adjust. The bathroom was immaculate with a very powerful shower (great after a long day of sightseeing!) and ample toiletries. The only problem we had during our stay was a leaky kettle in our room but this was replaced within minutes with no fuss, so no complaints there. I thought the hotel was very tastefully decorated from the lobbies, landings and rooms to the two restaurants. The view from the terrace restaurant is fantastic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can see how close the Aya Sofya and Blue Mosque are. We ate there one night and although it was perhaps a little more expensive than other restaurants, the view was great, atmosphere cosy and the waiting staff was very attentive. There is also free internet access which was very useful for checking-in for our flights on line. We didn't use the hotel pick-up service as they quoted 30 EUR which is a bit steep (only costs 25-35YTL in a taxi) but we used the hotel transport to the airport (as then it cost the same as getting a taxi!). The friendly driver turned up on time and dropped us off at the airport smoothly (always a relief at the end of a trip). As we were leaving before 7.30am (when breakfast starts) on our last day to catch our flight we thought we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to miss breakfast but the staff made tea for us and asked us to see if we wanted anything from what was being laid out breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all without us asking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the small touches like that that really count. The buffet breakfast was excellent with a wide range of cheeses, breads, jams, biscuits, olives etc (more than made up for the lack of fresh orange juice!)
