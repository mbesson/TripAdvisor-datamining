Nicely landscaped with small lake in a business park, it almost beckons one to stop and stay. The interior is almost the opposite of the surrounding property. We haven't stayed here in three years, and what a change this place has made in that time. Apparently Mgmt. has ignored cleaning and maintenance since our last stay. First hint was that the latch portion portion of the door jam was missing. Walking into the room the carpet was filthy and appeared that it had not been vacuumed in a while. Behind the door was a pile of dust and pieces of cereal. The carpet was frayed around the edges and had many stains in it. More observations: bathroom sink drained very slowly and had a stinking odor, rust stains in tub, black mold around and under tub caulking, black mold around edge of tub surround. water temperature control nob in tub broken off, tub drain plug broken in half, dark spots on bathroom floor, white and black stains in front of bathroom sink. brown stains on sink counter, couch cushions covered with black stains and strong odor emitted from couch when sat upon. no cold water from kitchenette sink faucet, bottom drawer of dresser broken, black dirt marks on all walls. Sheets appeared to clean, but when they were rolled back, a cricket jumped out from under them. On the positive the air conditioners seem to be new. The front desk said they had one other room, but upon inspection, it was just a filthy. Front desk did lend me a vacuum cleaner so that I could vacuum the room carpet. They also lent us a sheet to cover the couch and a rubber tub pad to cover the bottom of the club (although it took quite a while for them to find one). This use to be quite a nice place to stay, but now, it needs to be bulldozed down. Only stay here to get out of the rain.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prammage35@gmail.com", "Title": "\u201cThis place is nasty and dirty\u201d", "Author": "plove_11", "ReviewID": "UR116136792", "Content": "I will never stay here again.

Air unit was covered in filth, grime and mold and was missing pieces. The tub had a large, yellow/brown sludge in it--so dirty we refused to shower. Our non-smoking room had apparently been smoked in by every previous tenant...ashes everywhere and an overwhelming smoke odor that burned our eyes and caused coughing. The common areas were just as filthy as the room. I had my two year old with me, and would not let him touch anything or sit anywhere unless it was covered by the bedding we purchased.

They had no luggage cart so we made several trips from car to room. In the corridor was this big furry blob. Relieved that it was not a rat, we found it to be a pile of hair extension. There were arguments coming from the neighbor's door in languages I've never heard. We got into our room and found it, like some others on this site, pretty nasty. Dirty, stained carpet and similar condition for the furniture. There was moldy caulking in the bathroom. It was the kind of place which makes you wonder if an owner lives in a place which is this bad, if he just doesn't want to make any improvement, or if he is just clueless. The worst part was that we had to get up at 4 a.m. to make it to our reserved tour at Mammoth Cave.... and the front desk did not honor our request for a wake-up call and the alarm clock did not work either.

When we arrived we were told that they no longer had the double bed with sleeper sofa that we had reserved a week prior. We were told that the flood victims were taking the rooms. I'm ok with that I understand emergencies happen. So we had two options #1 take a room there with 1 queen bed and sofa bed or #2 transfer to the sister Hotel Extended Stay Deluxe. We went with option #2 after being told that the Extended Stay was much nicer, breakfast included, and outdoor pool. When we arrived we were really excited it had really looked like we had upgraded and still kept the good rate. DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER- Our first room had huge stains in the carpet and the counter tops were dirty in the kitchen. We called the front desk and then were escorted to another room that was still in need of a good carpet cleaning and a fresh paint job and the air was not cooling the room. We were then upgraded to a 2 room suite at no charge the only perk here was that we had to televisions. We gave up and stayed in the suite but I hated it and if I could do it over again I would of canceled the reservation and gone somewhere else.

The second (\"clean\") room had stains on the couch; old food in the kitchen; the cheapest furniture I've ever seen; the television didn't have one clear channel on it; The bedding had an odd smell to it; the pillows were so cheap and flat that it was as if we weren't even sleeping on pillows; several of the light bulbs/lamps were nonfunctional; there were no sheets for the pullout couch. Condition of property: The pool area, even though it was closed, looked junky (our room overlooked the pool); several chairs had been thrown onto the pool cover and things were strewn about. The music in the lobby was the most depressing, horrible noise that we've ever heard - even our children remarked on it. Amenity Issues: In-room internet was advertised but it turns out there is an extra charge for it. A pullout couch is advertised but no linens for it were in the room, forcing us to go downstairs and wait while they \"found\" them. A continental breakfast was advertised but the offerings were extremely sparse - a couple of muffins and bagels and a few pieces of fruit. The maintenece workers had cleared much of the \"breakfast\" out. Service quality: When arriving in Memphis we called ahead to see if we could go ahead and check in -- we were assured that we could. After fighting the mall traffic for thirty minutes to get to the hotel, we were forced to wait for at least twenty five minutes while the desk person took other guests ahead of us because \"she couldn't check us in right away\", even though we'd called ahead and been told we could. (There weren't more than ten cars in the whole lot, either at that point or much later on that evening; this hotel was NOT full or busy.) Once we were checked in, we got to the room to find that it was dirty (unmade beds, dishes in the sink) and had to drag all our luggage and kids back downstairs and wait longer until she gave us a different room. Another unduly long wait to get linens for the pullout couch; and yet another to check out. The room was reserved on Hotwire. We were charge another twenty five dollars upon arriving because we needed two double beds instead of a queen room. We will NEVER stay in another Extendedstay hotel, and we will probably never use Hotwire again because of the chance of getting such substandard accommodations.", "Date": "December 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "North GA", "Title": "\u201cThe worst place I have ever stayed\u201d", "Author": "icee", "ReviewID": "UR6363327", "Content": "This was my worst ever priceline experience. Our room stinked, stank, stunk! We arrrived late and the person that checked us in was not very nice. I had called a few days earlier to see if we could get a room with 2 double beds or a room with a king and a sleeper sofa. I was told that I could \"upgrade\" for $25. I also asked to be put in nonsmoking. Since the grandgirls had decided to go with us, I agreed to pay the upgrade. Of course when we got there they still had us assigned to a queen 1 bed with no sofa bed. Well the super friendly (NOT) desk clerk changed our room assignment while she grunted and groaned and huffed and puffed. We finally got to the room and it literally stunk....of course, we had been put in a smoking room. You could smell smoke as soon as you got off the elevator. Since it was so late we stayed in the room. I checked to make sure the sheets were clean and they were. We were put on the interstate side of the hotel and you could hear traffic all night long. It was like the cars were going to come thru the window any moment. When I checked out they charged me $35.99 + tax for the upgrade. I did not say a word about the overcharge. They definitely need the money more than I do. Maybe it can be used for a renovation. The website says they have done a complete renovation. Well, I don't know where they spent the money, but it wasn't in the stinky, stanky, stunky rooms. This place is literally the pits.
