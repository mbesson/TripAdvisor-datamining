{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Charming small hotel in Florentine hillside Charming 10 room hotel in hills ten minute drive outside of Florence. The property is tastefully appointed, and the location was a peaceful escape from the overwhelming summertime crowds in the city. The pool was perfect for late afternoons after sightseeing with children in heat of the the Italian summer. The staff was wonderful, very available to help coordinate and make reservations for our itinerary prior to arrival and extremely warm and hospitable. The ancient roads with hairpin turns leading up to the property were part of the Italian driving adventure, but the peaceful location, local flavor and gracious staff with relaxing breakfasts, beautfiful gardens, clean rooms with air conditioning all made this property part of a lovely Tuscan vacation.", "Date": "Aug 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR630557618", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ready2goCO"}, {"Content": "Could have been so much better Since Florence was our main destination in Italy, we splashed out on 10 days at the the Morais, but it was ultimately disappointing. First problem is the distance from the centre: it's just outside the city in a pleasant stretch of country, but that means you're at the mercy of the taxis, at 12-15 euros a go. That adds up fast, and the taxi quality was variable, with some dodgy fares attempted: you need to know what's reasonable when you get in. So with the wait  the 20 minute ride, you can easily lose 90 mins each day fighting the taxis. If you are there high season, then you also spend a lot of time hunting one for your return. For the hotel's price, I would like to have seen a daily return taxi fare included in the tariff.The distance also means that there's no food nearby, save one average restarant (which you'll only use once, and which you can't walk to: the road's too busy). There is a restarant in the hotel, and while the food was reasonable, the bill was ridiculously high; most nights no-one dined there. So more taxis back to town to eat each night. We travelled with two small kids, so this got tedious fast. Meanwhile breakfast was OK, but humble for the price.Which brings us to the Rules. The owners liked things done Properly. No food in the rooms (with small kids? yeah sure). None of your own wine consumed. Don't drive up to reception during breakfast. For these prices, I want my wishes to be uppermost. I'm not sure the service philosophy is there yet. They were very affable, and tried hard to arrange things (with varying success: our laundry returned monochrome, and their car hire suggestion failed to deliver) but we did feel like the difficult cousins sometimes, apologising frequently.Then there was the Smell. One of our rooms developed a sewerage smell early on. We've got a baby, so we assumed it was us somehow. After a while we realised it really was the toilet, as we found it in other places in the hotel. At times it was very difficult to stay in the room unventilated (but without insect screens, the viscious mosquitoes ate you if you left the windows open). We vividly demonstrated the smell to the staff, and they agreed it was awful. So now for this price, you'd get moved, perhaps upgraded, yes? No. we have some air freshener. By this point it was our last day, so we didn't start throwing things. In hindsight, we should have. And you should too, if you get the same situation there.What was good. Everyone was friendly, and fine with our kids. The pool was great  warm, with a lovely view across the valley. Beds  AC ok, and everything quiet (however beware the nearby tunnel works, hinting at a big road passing nearby soon). Showers only in our rooms, which was odd for the price,  not good for very small children.Now if this was a three or even four star, all these shortcomings could be overlooked as bearable, especially in Italy. However this was an expensive hotel by most people's standards. It was a our biggest outlay in Italy, and our expectations were disappointed.", "Date": "Nov 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR919182327", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Sedona2222"}, {"Content": "Loved it! We have spent 3 nights at la Marignolle on our honeymoon trip to Italy. As we have done a little reseach in advance and new what we are getting we were not dissapointed. The short drive (or taxi trip) to the city is well worthwhile. It is a very small hotel that feels more like visiting your friends house/villa with garden - for me a nice change from a large hotels with no personality. Lorenzo (owner/manager that my wife referred to as Antonio Banderas) was very helpful in advising us where to go, what to do, where we should eat, etc. He even helped us to organize accommodation at another hotel on the coast we were heading for. There is no restaurant at the hotel but they offer to prepare a meal for you if you ask in advance. We had a dinner at a Bibe restaurant few minutes walk from the hotel and can highly recommend it. Relaxing by the pool was definitely a big bonus after a whole day walk around Firenze!", "Date": "Aug 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR839725889", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "parviskanka"}, {"Content": "Very nice, perhaps overpriced... my opinion We stayed here in July 2007. Rooms, garden  pool are excellent; quiet relaxing and private. I would say, however, that it is somewhat overpriced. The breakfast is very sparse and a bit boring. If you want eggs, meat, cheese etc. you must pay extra! Really, this is uncalled for. Also, one night we stayed in to eat. The hotel does not provide evening meals as such but will prepare something for you which is very nice and accomodating. However, what they prepare is food which does not have to be cooked - salad, bruschetta, melon etc. It was the most expensive meal we had in Florence! Tut! Tut! Also, taxies into and back from Florence will set you back about 20 euro each way.

The Hotel Marignolle certainly oversells itself. The 'hotel' is recently built and is faintly reminiscent of a pensioners bungalow in middle england, with a breakfast room which reminded me of a motorway service station. None of the rooms had views or baths. The hotel sells itself on its homely details (lots of overdone 1980s upolstery, matching lamps, reproduction furniture and pictures of hunting scenes).

To be able to enjoy the Tuscan countryside only a few minutes from the city was very relaxing. The hotel does not have a view of the city, but the views of the surrounding hills and olive groves is wonderful. Our room was very clean, nicely decorated, and the bathroom big and comfortable. Lorenzo, and the rest of the staff were always helpful and pleasant. We took the optional Chianti Wine tour with Lorenzo, and it was a highlight of our trip.Due to very narrow and dark roads, you cannot safely walk to town. Cabs are required (10-15 Euro each way) so just plan ahead on using them. The breakfast was nice, but simple and somewhat limited in selection. YOu can get meat and eggs, but these items cost extra.

We arrived late afternoon, tired after a long day of traveling. We were offered some ice cream, which was a nice gesture, only to find out later that we were charged 16 euros for 2 very small dishes.  The room next to ours apparently had water damage which they were repairing. The first night we had to stay in the lobby for a couple of hours because of obnoxiously strong sealant fumes. We were told there was nothing that could be done and that we should understand that they needed to take care of this. I explained as paying guests our comfort and safety should be taken care of first. We were told that there would be no other problems. However, the second night we couldn't even use our rooms because they decided to paint!! At that point, we were given a room away from the problem area.While the two receptionists were always pleasant, the owner was not. His attitude was arrogant and he never apologised for our discomfort or inconvience. We were treated as if we were suppose to accomodate their needs.This is a costly, boutique hotel and there is a facade of hospitality, but it evaporates quickly and we were extremely disappointed in how we were treated.As a matter of fact, in all of our travels I don't think we have ever been treated so poorly.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR644890745", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Very nice place The Marginolle Relais is a very nice small hotel located in the hills outside of Florence.

There's a reason that everyone gives this place excellent reviews, because it is excellent. It is everything that all the other reviews indicated. The hosts, the rooms, the bathrooms, the soap, the service...I could go on and on. When I researched the hotels in Florence, I noticed that Marignolle's reviews were all excellent, and thus we made reservations for 3 nights. The hosts are very charming, gracious, kind and helpful. In Florence, reservations can be made in advance if you wish to visit the Uffizi gallery or the Accademia. Victoria and Lorenzo asked us immediately and offered to make the reservations for us. This saved us a 2 hour wait for tickets. It is all the little things that they do, plus the place itself is lovely. We loved the place, we loved their dog, Ginny, who loved to run and run on the grounds.

Wow. It's the best way to describe the Marignolle. Just came back from an amazing 4 day stay this month (June 2004).

Phenomenal service from everyone there - Lorenzo, Lorenzo's father, Victoria, Nicholas, etc. Would bend over backwards to help, recommend restaurants  places to go, book tickets for you, etc. It's truly a beautiful escape from the hectic centre of Florence, but so close. We didn't have a rental car, but it was only a 8-10 euro taxi cab to get into the heart of the city.

We loved the Marignolle. What a treat! From the moment son Lorenzo met us at the train station in the family Mercedes, we felt at home. We stayed three nights and could have stayed more. Marignolle is just outside of Florence (5-10 minutes by car/taxi) and you really feel like you are in the quiet rolling hills of Tuscany. Everything is pristine and manicured, the gardens, the swimming pool, the gazebo where we had a welcome champagne and fresh fruit on arrival. a delicous homemade breakfast is served either in the gazebo or in the lovely living room/parlour all with a room with a view. The family is as lovely as the place. Our room was extremely comfortable, with AC, Tv, phone, frigo bar, a selection of wines from the family cellar, a modern bathroom with beautiful soaps and thick towels. Even our own set up to make coffee or tea at any time. From the drapes to the kleenex boxes, everything matches. It is so charming. Everyone was so kind and hospitable. When we blew out our converter with our powerful American hairdryer, Lorenzo offered us one to use during our stay, he even tried to fix ours. Even a bad hairday is a good day at Marignolle! We highly recommend the chianti tour and wine tasting. Visited a small out of the way winery (Cennatoio)and enjoyed a perfectly relaxing day on the Chianti way. A lovely place to be.
