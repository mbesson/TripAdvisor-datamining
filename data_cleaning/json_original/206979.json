In the nine months of planning for the trip, I was in email communication with the hotel's manageress Raquel, who made it very clear that she and her team would be only too happy to assist us in our planning and needs. For the whole of our stay, we were made to feel welcome and that it was the hotel's pleasure to host our group. Breakfast was excellent, and all of the individual dietary needs of our pupils were met without any problem whatsoever. The meeting room adjacent to the eating area, which we hired out for the duration of the trip, was always laid out ready for us in the morning and thereafter transformed into a comfortable meeting area for us. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable, all with en suite bath and/or shower, and there was free wi fi in the lobby area, which the pupils enjoyed using. The hotel's location was excellent, a two-minute walk to the Alonso Cano metro station or 5-minute walk to the Rios Rosas metro station. I certainly would not hesitate to use this hotel again, be it for business, pleasure of nex year's school trip (although I'm not sure which of those two categories that falls into!).", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guayaquil", "Title": "\u201cNice location.

The room was big, bright and clean. The bathroom was ok and clean too, with many amenities. The view was nice, a big yard with pools. Two metro stations are located near the hotel (Rios Rosas and Alonso Cano). We didn't enjoy our beds, because they had rollers and they were moving all the time, although we tried to use breaks. Free wi-fi is available only in lobby, it's only for 30 minutes and the speed was slow. Staff was very friendly and helpful! There are many nice bars in the neighborhood and a Dia market right next to the hotel.

There is a big variety of restaurants of all kind in walking distance. The front of the hotel gives to a narrow and quiet street. The rooms might look a bit old, but are well maintained, comfortable and with all the necessary amenities. The windows are double so even if there could be some noise from the street it wont be perceptible. The bathroom is wide, the bathroom equipment is modest, but in good condition.

Located in a quiet, safe feeling district, the hotel was good value for money. It was clean, comfortable and the staff were very friendly. Best of all, there are three metro stations all within a 5-10 min walk. Its only 3 or 4 stops into the centre of the city (takes about 10 mins) and the metro also provides easy access to the airport. Madrid's metro is one of the best underground systems I've travelled on. Its fast, efficient and very affordable (6-7 Euros for a 10 trip ticket). We had a fantastic time in this city.

Even walking to the historic city centre is possible (20 minutes). It is also very convenient for the airport (10 minute walk to the metro line which goes straight to Barajas). The area is quiet and safe, but still has a couple of streets full of good restaurants for tapas and wine, in a very lively atmosphere of local people.

And for a 3 stars hotel you dont find this kind of service.

The room, was spacious, very clean, and well furnished, the bathroom, clean and shiny, with lots of towels, and hot water! The Breakfast, delicious, Full Continental style, with a Spanish toutch, lots of fresh fruit and Tortilha, I recomend! The personal, was allways very pleasent and helpfull, and I didn't expect so many attention for someone being there just for a night. NH Hotels are good Value for Money, I payed 90\u20ac, with taxes and breakfast, its not that cheap, but You will not find this price in any other good Madrid hotels.
