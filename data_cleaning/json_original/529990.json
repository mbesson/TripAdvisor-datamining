{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent location, fantastic value , would definitely go again Went for five nights, 7-12 December , slightly daunted by some of the adverse website comments so were a bit put off be the dreary concrete stairs with no lift, but if you're not reasonably fit should you be going to Florence anyway, or perhaps go on a package holiday where they can carry you about. Any way when you get up those stairs - we're in our late 60s not especially athletic,but we soon got used to it. When you get to reception it's just like any other small hotel reception - the staff were attentive and in general were cheerful and friendly. Our bedroom was large and well-heated with a comfortable bed and the basin shower room was`a bit on the small side but the water always seemed hot.The dining room was plain but bright - self service of course plenty of coffee and cereals the usual tasteless rolls/croissants but when is it much better? Room cleaned daily. Marvellous central location, only about 10 minutes from the station, 5 mins from PonteVecchio, Duomo, Signoria etc. This price 60 euros for 2 with breakfast per night, in this location - I couldn't find anyhing anywhere comparable. Go there", "Date": "Dec 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR950983342", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "For the very Budget minded Traveler Okay...this hotel is on the 3rd or 4th floor of a residential building( No elevator). Its about a 10 min walk from Santa Maria Novella train station in the Centro area and about a 2 blocks from Via Tournabuoni. It might be a bed  breakfast, ( i had the feeling that I was in someones large Apt) but I'm not sure because we were approached with this option in the train station and it was only 80 euros per ngt so we took it. The other guest we observed were college age or young adults.The room we received was quite spacious but the bathroom small. The linens and towels were clean and so was the room.. The only staff observed was at the small reception desk and she was quite friendly and spoke a small amount of english. The breakfast included in the rate was VERY basic was not the best.The location was great as we walked to everything and quietl. But the buzzer at the front entrance did not make me feel secure as anyone that buzzed was let in and the front door on the 3rd floor was always opened.", "Date": "Oct 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR784024292", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ATLtraveler"}, {"Content": "Das Zimmer, welches wir...   showReview(12871301, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 18, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR176511740", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d529990-r4241697-Hotel_Adam-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "529990", "Price": "$97"}}
