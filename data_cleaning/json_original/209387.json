Nightly price is a bit high for what I would consider smaller rooms but the appointments and larger bathrooms do a fine job of making up for the room size limitations. The staff absolutely go out of their way to take care of you and often remember your name after meeting you just once. Due to the Hyatt\u2019s location on Key West they are quite limited to actual beach space so they have added some nice make-shift beach areas next to the pool that face the ocean. Certainly served our needs just fine. The hotel manager found out that we got engaged while in Key West and had champagne and strawberries waiting for us in our room when we returned from dinner the second night. In addition he stopped by and said hello on multiple occasions when we were sitting on the beach and even bought us a few drinks. The property is extremely well cared for and very clean. Additionally, the Hyatt is close to the action at Mallory Square but not too close, so you get all the benefit without the noise. It is also a short walk to Duval Street. Parking was a bit tight at times but not a major dilemma. We only went to the hotel restaurant for breakfast, the food was very well prepared, the prices perhaps a little high but reasonable for hotel restaurants and the outdoor seating on the ocean well worth it.

The check in process was good, the bellboy and the staff was very helpful and nice to us. We were escorted up to our room which was seemingly quite newly renovated. The room was quite okay and we did not really spot anything wrong with it at first. We did however come upon two issues with the room: 1) Aircon was loud 2) The bed overhead fan was downright scary. As we started it, we found it was wiggling and we were actually convinced it would fall down so we had to stop it. This is obviously not good :) The location as many has mentioned is awesome. The pools were nice enough as well. The restaurant we found to be inconsistent. The fish sliders were awesome, however the grilled calamari was quite oily and very very tasteless. We ate at the restaurant the next morning as well and the buttermilk pancake they use under the lobster egg benedict was so bitter we could not actually eat it. Service was acceptable, but not really up to par for the pricing of the room (which was at about 500 usd/night++). I would say if you come from a Hyatt Regency like the one in Miami or Orlando this hotel is a good step up in the right direction. But, coming from great stays like we've had in Park Hyatt Tokyo or Park Hyatt Chicago this is a serious step down and not even close to matching it.

We rented a tandem bicycle (from Eaton St Bike Shop) for our stay and locked it up at night at the bike stands adjacent to the valet parking area. We noticed cruise ships parked in front of the Westin on quite a few days and I know that wouldn't be what I'd care to look at when gazing toward the gulf.

There was a small balcony that could barely fit 2 people if you were real careful. BTW this balcony overlooked a beach area used by the KW wino community which did add some local color.

On arrival we were greeted with a glass of champagne by the very friendly front desk staff. They were able to accommodate our request for a high floor, even though the hotel was full. Throughout our stay we found all the staff to be extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. Our room was on the 3rd floor of building 3 at the back of the building. In spite of being on the end farthest from the ocean, we still had a very good ocean view (see picture). We could also see parts of the town and cruise ships coming and going in the distance, which was fun. Immediately below our balcony was a parking lot leading to a small public beach. As mentioned by some other reviewers, the beach was occupied by a handful of homeless people, which may bother some guests. The only other issue with our room location was a dumpster in the parking lot below which was very noisily emptied early in the mornings by a large truck - once at 4:15am ! Other than that, this was probably the quietest hotel room I've ever stayed in. The hotel was busy but we never heard a sound from other rooms or the hallway. One thing we noticed about building 3 was that the expensive ocean front rooms had very poorly designed balconies right beside the public stairs - no privacy at all. The room itself was spacious, bright, well furnished and comfortable, with a nice sitting area and a smallish balcony. The bathroom was modern, clean, and had adequate space for all our toiletries. The large glass walled rain shower was great. We did find the housekeeping service to be later than we prefer - on several days they hadn't arrived by 3pm so we ended up not getting the room cleaned those days. The common areas of the hotel were very nice, and we thought the pool area was lovely - it's quite small and surrounded on 3 sides by the hotel buildings, which limits the sun, but also helps block the wind - which was pretty strong during our stay. We did take issue with other guests saving chairs at the pool. There were only a small number of chairs that got morning sun, and every day people put towels/personal items on these, then went off to breakfast, shopping, etc., often for several hours. I know this is a common (although rude) practice in other places, but the hotel should address it more assertively than with the small sign that wasn't even in the pool area. We saw many people disappointed that they were forced to sit in the less desirable areas while the best spots sat empty for hours. The location of the hotel was great for us. We liked that it was away from the crowds of Mallory Square, but only a 5 minute walk if we wanted to go there. There are a huge number of restaurants and bars within short walking distance. We enjoyed the Duval St. area, but also really liked the scenery and restaurants in the marina right beside the hotel.

Carl, the bellman, gave us a tour of the property on the way to our room. The fitness center is open 24 x 7, the concierge had extended hours, the pool area had wonderfully comfortable chaise lounges with pillows and the hot tub was large enough to accommodate several people without feeling cramped. Upon entry to our room, we encountered a hint of aromatherapy which was refreshing. The small balcony had a partial oceanview and the bathroom had plenty of counter space for our toiletries. The provided shower get, shampoo, conditioner & lotion were also scented in the same aromatherapy as we encountered upon entry to the room...ahhh! The room also contained a dorm-size refrigerator and two complimentary bottles of water which were replenished daily. The resort fee covers free parking and in-room internet access.

This is to be their top room category. Unfortunatly, the room was a dud. The room itself was very nice and very clean, but it was on the first floor and was right onto of the \"public beach\" next to the Hyatt and right by the Jet Skis. The public beach tends to be a hang out of unsavory looking people looking like they are doing unsavory types of things. It was a real let down. The Hyatt is extra special to us as we were married there and had our reception there. So I was really bummed that our expectations were not met. I knew I would be grumpy each time were were on one of the balconies staring at that stuff, so I decided to go to the front desk and talk to them. I ran into the Director of Operations who recognized me and asked how the room was. I told him, and he said go to the front desk and they will figure something out to make sure we are happy. I went to the front desk and explained myself and she took me around to a couple rooms to see what would be good for me. we would not be able to moved until the next day, but she gave us options. When I told her about my favorite room type, she arranged for us to be moved there and they explained to me how to go about booking those rooms in the future so I would know how to get the room I wanted. The next day, we packed up, left out stuff in the room, and when the King Salon room we wanted was vacated, the moved all of our stuff (including our beverages in the fridge) from our old room to the new one. they then called my cell phone and let me know it was all taken care of. The new room was fantastic and we were on cloud nine that they bent over backwards to make us happy. And when my wife had an accident on a bicycle, everyone showed concern and interest for the rest of our trip. They offered use of their wheelchair, they offered to call their on staff doctor and made sure we knew we could call them for everything.

The staff was very gracious here - although they did make a mistake with our rooms the day of our arrival, they couldn't have been nicer and more efficient in rectifying it and this attitude continued throughout our stay.

To our success we were confirmed at the Hyatt Windward Pointe Resort in Old Town Key West for $190.00 a night. With such a great deal, there is a price to pay, just remember that when using Priceline. Upon our arrival we were met with a very polite valet, who grabbed our bags and ushered us into the Hyatt Lobby. It was 2:30pm, and I thought check in would be easy, well it was but were weren't allowed to check in till 4:00pm, the staff was nice, but I was kinda disappointed about this, I remember 3:00pm check in times, well not to let us down we left our bags and went exploring. At 4:30 we made our way back to the Hyatt and breezed through check in, although they do charge $20.00 for hotel amenities which is equivalent to two bottles of water, and free Wi/Fi in there lobby area. This I could have done without, a waste of time and $20.00 We were shown to our room by a very friendly and attentive staff member, room 2107, if you ever get this room, if your by yourself and you got a good rate stay, don't complain think of the good rate, but if your there with someone else, problem, problem, problem! Room 2107 and most likely 2105 are most likely the least desirable rooms at this beautiful resort. yes it's a not so nice view, but even worse is it has two twin size beds. Well, I went down to see if I could change up, but no such luck. I was told that twin size beds are the new queen size bed. Kind of an unappreciated lame excuse. Now mind you, the staff was still very friendly. This was a spontaneous quick trip and I've always expected little rocks in the road, if this were a planned event, this would not be a kosher episode, and I would have been unhappy. But, Priceline I'm sure is more responsible, As you the adage goes you get for what you pay for, buy somewhere out there someone paid full boat for that room, and that's a true disappointment, there is plenty of room for a king size bed in there, they should try it out. Another disappointment about room 2107 is your right under the lobby, so people entering/exiting all hours of the night, you will hear them.

The Hyatt website & printed materials would lead potential guests to believe, incorrectly, that this is a 4-5 star resort, similar to other Hyatt Resort Properties in Hawaii & elsewhere. Unfortunately, that is simply not the case. This hotel has been around for decades & periodically Hyatt throws some money to remodel & update, but this place is fighting to stay relevant. Hyatt does it's brand-image no favors by continuing to list this property as something it isn't. It's a pleasant place. but it is NOT a 4-5 star resort by any measurement. Very small pool & beach area. There is \"no\" inside bar &/or area to relax. Only an outside pool bar that seems to keep sporadic hours you cannot count on. Tiny lobby that is certainly not inviting to sit & relax. Very small balconies on the majority of rooms, with a table that is way too large for the area & 2 chairs. You have to move around the furniture & maneuver around it if 2 people want to use it. There are a few larger balconies, so if this is important, be SURE to confirm it in advance. Furniture is in good shape & looks fairly new, though the upholstered chairs in our room were \"way past\" due for a good cleaning. Great bed & linens & top notch housekeeping as usual with Hyatt properties. Unfortunately, service is lacklustre at best. Friendly, courteous, helpful & professional staff, but we heard numerous employees complain about being short of staff, which explains the poor service levels, even though it was over 1 of the biggest annual festival weekends in Key West. Didn't try the restaurant, but others with us did, & told us we were better to go elsewhere. On the plus side you cannot beat the location. Self-parking is included in the rate, which is a big deal in Key West, & you won't need to move your car once you arrive. Overall it is a typical older motel-type property, with low ceilings & cramped rooms, but Hyatt tries to to make the best of it.

We expected it to be a leisurely experience, where we would sit at the pool and read a book and relax. We self parked and there was no charge. As a gold passport member, we were not charged for Internet either. When we arrived, we were greeted at the front desk with frindly smile and asked a question. Would we like a glass of champagne or strawberry water? Nice touch. Everyday they have a different flavor of water, including a thirst quenching cucumber water. We were in a standard room and we overlooked the gulf and pool. Wonderful view. The room was not overly large, but still had adaquate room with a small balcony. Every single employee we came across from the front desk to the chanbermaids went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We walked towards the pool looking for the concierge, where we met Charlie. He said he might be able to help us. He told us about Fantasy Fest. It sounded interesting and he supplied us with literature and tips as to what activities to look for and where to look for them. He also supplied us with a local map. The hotel is a block or so from Duval St. where all the activity was taking place. We walked down there and found thousands of people having a wonderful party. Yes, it is heaven for exibitionists, who want to show off their bodies whether young and beautiful or old, fat and weathered. This is not for the prudish type. Seridipity is the art of finding something you weren't looking for. We found it in Fantasy Fest. It is a combination of Halloween and Madri Gras. We did not witness any of the drunken roudiness that we would have expected. New York has the Easter Parade, where everone strolls down 5th Avenue and is invited to wear unique hats. By comparisaon, NY's Easter Parade is quite tame. In Key West, people are invited to wear costumes or not. Many do not actually get get dressed up in costumes, but rather have them painted on their naked bodies. Both Friday and Saturday we saw thousands of people strolling up and down Duval Street with various costumes snapping pictures by the boatload. We walked our feet off and reluctantly left as it began to shower, which stopped as we approached the hotel. We then walked around the boardwalk area near the Hyatt, which has one waterfront restaurant after another. We had a delightful meal. We went to our room and found the bed and linens very comfortable and had a restful nights sleep. The next day we walked past Charlie again, he asked us how we made out and we thanked him for all his help. We told him we were looking for a place to eat andhe directed us. We decided to stoop at the \"schooner ?\" Which is an outdoor garden type of reataurant. They had a guitar player Michael McCloud who was a Jimmy Buffett wanna be, but was quite entertaining. The food was OK, the service very slow. We then proceded back to Duval St. and once again had a wonderful voyeauristic experience. Charlie had told us about the big Parade at night and that there would be 100,000 people squeezed into 10 blocks. We saw place that have viewing seats and they were charging as much as $350 or $175 p/p standing room, but that included drinks and dinner. We noticed some people brought picnic chairs and started lining up along the curb. We found a Walgreens, purchased a bottle of wine and two chairs. We parked ourselves at the curb and instead of walking up and down Duvall St, we had the strollers, walk past us as we sipped on our wine. We sat there for several hours, as the time passed quickly, until the parade began. After all the excitement about the parade, both my wife and myself were a bit disappointed. We felt the floats were for the most part amateurish. Nevertheless, we had a great time. We ate at the street fair and loved every minute of this totally unexpected experience. I imagine some of the Tea Party Tea Totalers would have a hard time appreciating the body art, costumes and floats. We loved it.

Beach/water sports and pool. Cons: cleanliness. It was generally clean with a few minuses. We stayed in a salon room (king with a large balcony overlooking the pool/water) There were dirty feet marks on the wall. The upholstery was grey insead of yellow on the seat. Glossy white tile floors need serious bleach in the grout- which normally wouldn't be a big deal but it's KW and you are frequently barefoot in your room. We asked to have the sheets changed twice during a 10 night stay and they never changed them and house keeping routinely forgot to get remove dirty items. Such as a cloth napkin for 3 days and empty wine glasses left on counter. If your going to KW for the first time, highly recommend a hotel with beach and pool on the Mallory Sq side of Duval.

We stayed at the Hyatt Resort and Spa on Front Street. The location was absolutely perfect. The rooms were spacious and the shower was big enough for four people. Nice and roomy for whatever you like do in the shower with company!! Two short blocks to Duval Street and right on the Gulf. It was very easy to walk around to the waterfront restaurants and shopping. Duval Street is definitely the hot spot. More bars than you can imagine and plenty of restaurants too. My favorite was actually right next to the Hyatt, called A&B Lobster House. The meal was a bit pricey, even by NY standards, but was outrageously good. I had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and 10 oz. lobster tail ($70) and started with a very creamy and chunky lobster bisque. By chunky I mean lots of little bits of lobster, not the usual two small clumps. The best seafood for cheap was at Half Shell Raw Bar, right on the waterfront. If you go for happy hour (4:30 pm to 6:30 pm) you get everything for 1/2 price. That includes the food, so we pigged out for sure. Abbondanza's Italian was also very good. Bring your appetite because the pasta portions are HUGE. I mean I must have had one pound of linguine with my shrimp scampi!! And my wife's linguine with white clam sauce was just as big. One dozen clams (in the shell) to top the pasta off. And very reasonable prices. It was a little out of the way for us (we were on the north-west side of the island and Abbondanza is on the southern part) but was worth the twenty minute walk. I have to say the Key West is a remarkable place to have a really good time. You can find happy hours that begin at 7 am!!! Yea, in the morning. Of course you must visit Sloppy Joe's for drinks and a live band, The Hog's Breath which is kinda small but very lively at night, Schooner's on the water. It looks kinda run down, but that is part of the appeal. Good for breakfast, as it is cheap. The one thing I did find is that breakfast everywhere was pricey. Wierd, lunch was actually cheaper in many places than breakfast. I went to Pepe's, nice but not really impressive. The food was good though. Cheese Burger Cafe was a good breakfast (and $3.50 bloody mary's) and reasonable. Southernmost Beach Cafe was also nice. Right on the water, near the monument bell with the \"90 miles to Cuba\" stamp. Amazing that all the beaches are imported. I mean they don't have sandy beaches in Key West. Wherever their is sand, it was brought in from Florida proper or Cuba!!! The south side of the island basically has the beaches, but they are not typical caribbean tytpe beaches, so don't expect too much from them. As for the rest of the bars and restaurants, there is something for everyone. If like to sit on a ssaddle while you drink your beer, go to Cowboy Bills, if you like to be nude and drink, go to the Garden of Eden. Honestly, clothing is optional!!! If you are more traditional, go to the Hard Rock Cafe. We had a blast in Irish Kevin's. The entertainer (one guy with an acoustic guitar) is absolutely hysterical. He is Pauly from NY, so you know we had fun with him, especially when he was making fun of the red sox (Boston fans were on hand). He is a real character and insults just about everyone. If you can't laugh at yourself, better not go. All in all, a great trip and will definitely return (with lots of friends next time). Two quick tips: Hit as many happy hours as you can BEFORE dinner. You save a lot of money on food and drinks with half price specials. We did that each night, then went back to the hotel to shower and change for dinner. Works out great. Second, take the Hop on Hop Off Trolley tours (any one). They are worth the $20. Very nice drive, very informative and it's the cheapest way to get around. You can hop on and off all day, so go out early. And one more thing: be prepared for flooding during heavy rainstorms. The streets by our hotel turned into rivers after a one hour rainstorm. It did rain really hard, but you will have to wade through one to two feet of water in spots, so wear flip flops. And I left Hurricane Irene behind, with little flooding by me only to get flooded in Florida!!!!

Everyone is so nice and the rooms are just to our liking. They are modern and clean looking, with really comfortable beds and a wonderful walk in shower. Unfortunately, this is the second time in a row that we didn't have the wooden stool in the shower that makes it easier for my wife to shave her legs. I wish they had those in every room. This is our 3rd stay at the Hyatt in the past 14 months. We were married there in June of 2010 and had our reception there. It was wonderful. This trip we were in room 3201. It is a gulf front room with pretty views, but the palm trees take away some of the view towards Sunset Key. The view towards Christmas Tree Island is beautiful. Being up one more floor (at least) would help with that. We really did love this room though. Being right on the water just makes the views that much more special. Having a mini fridge in the room is great to keep our Diet Mt Dew cold along with extra bottles of water. This particular room had a little less storage than the last 2 we have had. Probably because of the layout, but a couple more drawers would have been helpful. The location can't be beat. Steps from the Bight and steps from Duval. Even being that close to the action, you still feel like you are in a little retreat. You never hear any noise. The views from the pool and docks are wonderful. Everyone we had contact with was very nice. From the Director of Operations, to the pool servers, bartenders, waitress at the restaurant to the housekeeping staff. Our rooms didn't get cleaned until late afternoon usually, and I would have preferred it done a little earlier, but the rooms were always clean. One frustrating thing was the prevalence of non-guests swimming in the pool. There was a very large group one day and they were very loud and a couple of the kids were swimming in their street clothing. They brought their own bottle of rum and seemed to be hitting it pretty well. It got so loud it drove us from the bar and we went back to our room. I really think management needs to take control of situations like that. Instead, they gave them a \"locals discount card\" so I guess they encourage non-guests to come. I think that it is one thing to encourage them to come and have drinks or eat, but another to take over parts of the pool. The relaxation factor left the pool that day. Management needs to step up and take control. With the exception of the pool issue, we had a wonderful trip and look forward to staying at the Hyatt again.

The bellman takes our luggage and that of our best friends and takes us to our rooms, WOW!! It was a birthday celebration weekend, so I booked a Deluxe Gulf Front Room for us and our friends. We were on the 4th floor, the view was amazing. Let's start with the room, we had tiled floors with rugs, so it made it quite warm and inviting. We had 3 sliding doors with 2 balconies which were furnished with nice wicker furniture and small tables. From the bed we had an unobstructed view of the gulf and the boats anchored in the bay. The room also had 2 chairs and a chaise lounge type sofa. We had a flat screen TV, a mini bar with refrigerator. The headboard to the bed ran along the wall and was a shelf with slide outs that hid and housed the ihome for the ipod and telephone. The bathroom was fabulous too, a nice rain shower that was huge and tiled in an ocean blue glass tile. We never want to leave. I had ordered an in room amenity and it was in the rooms when we arrived with a lovely card and instructions that the cold items were in the refrigerator. The service was impeccable our entire stay. We dined at the restaurant on property for breakfast once and again the service was great, dined on the patio next to the water and the food was delicious. We did use the concierge services to make a dinner reservation for us one night and they couldn't have been more helpful. She reserved a great table and then proceeded to give us recommendations on the specialties of the restaurant and which ones to try. This is someone who is familiar with the area and the restaurants and I love that. Self-Parking is available and is included in the daily resort fee, however the lot is small and we had trouble finding parking. But not to worry, the valet opened up the valet parking for us, parked the car and didn't charge us the valet charges, he got a nice tip!

There's a little beach -- not a great beach but not sure there are great beaches in Key West. There was a lot of seaweed in the water. One big plus was that while the beach was not big, there were docks we could jump off and land in crystal clear blue water. So swimming was definitely available -- you just won't be laying on a beach. There is a nice deck with chairs and umbrellas. We didn't eat at the hotel. Right up the street was a good breakfast place (Two Friends Patio). Parking is free -- and one night they had no spots available due to a wedding and they had to valet park my car. They did not charge for the valet parking in the case, a very nice touch!! Best advantage for this hotel -- location!!! We were able to walk just about everyone. It's maybe 2-3 blocks from Duval Street. Restaurants are all within walking distance. Hotel staff were very nice. They offer jet-skiing tours there. We booked a jet ski tour for a much cheaper rate on Duval Street -- but in retrospect, it might have been better to pay a little more and book at the hotel because no shuttles from one place to another were involved.

Since space on the bike was limited we shipped the majority of our clothing down in advance. Slight concern when we arrived at 8 pm and were told that our FedEx box was locked in a manager's office but must have been a misunderstanding because it was quickly retrieved. Front desk staff were great though. Caitlin and Stacy even shipped our clothing box back home for us instead of making us haul it to a FedEx! The room was clean, spacious and overlooked a tiny beach area. Our fridge wasn't all that cold and we were concerned about keeping some seafood leftovers in it overnight. Called down to the front desk and they said it was a \"cooler\", not a fridge (which is what Hyatt.com calls it) and that it would only keep cold things cold. We put the seafood in with a bucket full of ice and it was plenty cold by morning. Maid service was probably the worst part of the hotel. A few unusual things weren't cared for that usually are taken care of in hotels of that class. For example, the ice bucket had a little water left in it after we dumped the ice and it was just left near the TV as is. We were running out quickly one day and I left up the ironing board because we were late. The board was left in the middle of the foyer and they just cleaned around it. The bathroom and linens were clean though, which was much more important to me than having to take down an ironing board when we got back that day. Only other problem with the maid service was our last day. We had arranged a late checkout of one extra hour with the front desk. Front desk staff were very accomodating but at exactly noon the maid was banging on the door telling us we had to get out. When we told her it had been cleared with the front desk she told us she was going to verify that, in a tone that sounded like she didn't trust us one bit. Didn't try the bar or restaurant but had room service one morning and it was fine. Portions are huge - my husband and I really should have split one meal instead of ordering two (particularly since it cost $55 for two meals, coffee and a hot chocolate!) We had a boat excursion the day we ordered room service so we indicated on the tag that we'd need it at 7 am and they were very prompt with delivery. The grounds are well cared for, including a few cute pools of turtles who can been seen basking in the sun. Didn't use the pool area but it looked clean. The fitness center looked modern and of adequate size. The absolutely best part of this hotel is it's location. It's not on Duvall so you don't get the noise but it's only a block away. It's closest to the most popular spots on Duvall (Sloppy Joes, Hog's Breath, Captain Tony's). We also walked to Mallory Square, and the Harborwalk (starts by A&B Lobster House) . The surrounding area feels very safe and the hotel must have been well insulated because even being near a few bars it was still very quiet at night. There's a $20 resort fee but they don't nickel and dime you for everything else once you get there. Parking was included, wifi included and we even had a few waters left in our room each day.

The grounds are beautiful, the hotel itself is well maintained, the rooms are modern and clean, the service is very friendly and the view is amazing! At this hotel, it is definitely worth asking for an ocean view. It is only a few blocks away from the famous Mallory Square which means you get to view the sunset that everyone raves about right at the hotel. Each room also has a small private patio with a table and two chairs. However, if you can't see it from your room you could also walk to the upper deck (above SHOR) for a great view. On that note, the location is also spectacular. It's tucked away in a quiet, cozy corner but is only a short walking distance away from many great restaurants and attractions. You can also rent scooters, electric cars, or jet skis right on the premises. Parking is a little tight, many times there were only one or two spots available and that was mid-week. The restaurants on site had tempting menus, but we chose to leave the property for our meals so I can't rate them. There is also a spa on site, which I never had the chance to try. In addition, there is a whirlpool and a small pool, but the pool is relatively shallow (3'9\" at it's deepest). After walking around Key West for hours, the whirlpool was definitely appreciated. Overall, our experience here was great and I would definitely recommend it to friends.

There is no fridge in the room but the hotel quickly provided one when asked but it looked like the bait fridge in your local walmart. Inside was beat up and cracked w/ no shelf. It really looked nasty. The furniture definitely had more than its share of wet rear ends from people going from the pool to the cloth couch and the water marks weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very appealing.

So on balance (& with TA reviews) we decided on the Hyatt as we preferred the gulf view. We had a lovely deluxe Gulf view room with 2 balconies. Our room was large with sofas & chairs, the bed was really comfy. The bathroom was good with a great shower. The hotel has been updated although they must start to keep on top of the maintenance.

The hotel itself is well located, the staff are nice - but the other guests - goodness they are loud and not discrete.

But at the Hyatt although their breakfast was excellent....their price could break anyone's budget especially if they have a family. We chose to eat out for our other meals and they were also excellent and well worth what we spent! There was no place to grab a quick cup of coffee or a sandwich if you came back from sightseeing. And no where to grab a drink if you wanted - when the weather turned cold since everything is outside. I must also admit that I expected the Hyatt to have a courtesy van but they didn't.

Of course the room is beautiful, and we had a nice, albeit, small balcony with a nice view, but it was very costly considering that we had only a cooler/ no refrigerator, no microwave, and it was a room, not a suite. The bath was what appeared to be a handicapped accessible shower only, and it was huge and nice, but for the fact that their was no door on it, and any water that splashes on you invariably splashes out onto the marble floor, where if you don't put down a towel, or bath mat, you will promptly fall and break your non-handicapped hip. But it was worth having luxurious digs in a good location in Key West. The bed was spectacular. I think the linens were sent straight from Heaven. It was the most comfortable sleeping I had in all of Florida. The pool and bar area were lovely. The lighting throughout the hotel was tasteful, as was all the decor. The ambient music in the main office could be a little overpowering at times, and I felt myself going into a trance there at one point, but snapped to finally and escaped out the door to dinner. It was quiet, comfortable and generally beautiful. I did take note that I didn't see a staff member that appeared to be over 25, and did feel a bit of an old fogy, but they were all very sweet, and not totally in a \"children of the corn\" kind of way. The hotel was within walking distance of Duval Street, one of the main attractions of Key West, but far enough away to not be right in the center of things on the more noisy evenings. I'm sure there are places to be had with better views, and perhaps even parts of our hotel had better views, but we spent most of our time out of the hotel, and it was simply luxurious comfort when we were there.

Also, the beach area isn't very big, but it's pretty cool. The water is super clear, there are almost no waves, and you can actually do some decent snorkeling right there.

I've stayed in several cheap hotels on both sides of Roosevelt Blvd, guest houses on Duval, and at Hyatt. When I stay at Hyatt, I have no need for a rental car. Just an $8 per person taxi ride from the airport. On this second visit, the girls at the desk actually remembered me from my previous visit. Several times, when we returned to our room, the wine and snack fairy had visited. Each time, was a nice little hand-written note from the desk. Everybody there is friendly. The person doing landscaping, cleaning the pool, emptying the trash, whatever... they all happily say hello to you. Personally, when on vacation, I sleep and shower in the room and that's about it. I found the rooms more than adequate for that. The shower is nice and roomy. The bed was clean and comfortable and the floors, walls, and furniture were very clean as well. When I stayed on Roosevelt Blvd (both N and S), I had to drive into town and find and pay for a place to park. The Hyatt is just two blocks from Duval Street. It is very convenient to the popular attractions... if you don't mind a little walking. I dive and it was very nice having the Southpoint Divers dive boat docked right in front of the hotel. I love where this hotel is. Just around the corner is the boardwalk for the historic seaport where you can drool over boats and yachts, take a late night stroll, or stop for a drink or some food at A&B Lobster House, the Commodore, Conch Republic Seafood Company, Schooner Wharf, or Turtle Kraal. The Rum Barrel is right across the street from the Hyatt as well (try their Philly cheesesteak nachos!) Key West does have some public beaches but it really isn't a \"beachy\" island. If you have children that like water parks and stuff, KW probably isn't the place for you. The pool at Hyatt is very clean. It's not large but KW is a small island so land is scarce and comes at a premium. There is an small upper sandy beach area just off building 3 that has some great views. Down some steps from that is a very small beach area with water access. There are only 3 or 4 reclining chairs in this area. Lots of cool little reef fish along the rocky wall if you look for them in and around the rocks. Snorkeling here works as well. You can even wade out to a small wooden floating platform with 2 lounge chairs. On my most recent visit, I had a view of the boat ramp, public beach, the beautiful Customs House, the cruise boats in the distance, the Shipwreck Historeum tower, Sunset Key, and Christmas Tree Island. I did see what looked like a homeless couple in that area but they didn't appear to bother anybody. Somebody mentioned chickens and roosters. The roam around the island. You will probably hear or see roosters regardless of where you stay. I found it kind of entertaining. Internet access was available but I don't think it is free. Would be nice for them to include it. Also, I think somebody mentioned some kind of resort fee. I don't like feeling nickel and dimed and it would be nice if they just integrated that stuff into the nightly rate. The breakfast package (awaken on their website) is nice. The food is expensive but you get a credit for most of it. Honestly, with the tip, I probably spent the same on breakfast that I would have spent elsewhere so I think it's pretty much a wash. Given the awaken package and the 4th night free, it's not a bad deal. Especially since I don't have to pay to park or rent a car. It's expensive but so is just about every other place to stay in KW.

However, the hotel is very average for a Hyatt. No regency club, daily charge for Internet, a small, shallow pool that you share with other Hyatt properites and their guests, a cloudy small hottub and a five chair beach (it looks bigger in the pictures). The room design is strange like mentioned in previous reviews with a long hall that is cold and slippery when wet. Box air conditioners are noisy and very Days Inn like. The bathroom is large and the shower is almost too big to a point that it is cold in there when taking a shower. The toilet is very tight and the toilet paper roll holder makes the toilet feel very cramped. Parking is also very limited and very tight for large vehicles as the spots are very close together so park early in the day as most of the spots are for compacts. There are homeless people who sleep at the back of the property as I discovered one night and there is a parrot on property that makes noise throughout the day cutting into my relaxing quiet time. Basically, if you want to be close to the action and could not care about amenities and just need a nice bed, then this is your place.

We came to Key West to celebrate our 25th Anniversary and are so glad we chose the Hyatt, because we will definetly be back many times. Ken sent champagne and choc covered strawberries for our 25th anniversary, which was a wonderful touch. Our room was 3412, which had partial gulf view . There can be some noise from the garbage trucks at some mornings, but it did not bother us at all. I do not sleep well ever, and it was a pleasure sitting on the balcony late at night having both a city view and a gulf view. The added plus is also having a beautiful sunset view right off the balcony! Rooms are gorgeous, very spacious! The beds are very comfortable, the bathroom is to die for, large shower, beautiful rain shower, water always hot. Comfortable large towels and all necessities needed, just bring a toothbrush! Hairdrier is the large ones, not the small ones attached at walls. The cleaning staff is very efficient and always brought extra towels. Room service was excellent. Most mornings we ordered coffee, there is a coffee pot for your use if you choose that instead. The bar area was great, the bartenders are happy great people and there is always a drink special. The restaurant, we only ate there for breakfast and the food was delicious and the view is perfect! Location of the hotel cannot be more perfect! You have Duval a few blocks down, Harbor Walk right next door, Mallory Square another few blocks away and even if you want to go to the other side of Key West, the walk which is about a mile, is entertaining and very easy to do. We rented jetskiis and bycicles from an outfit that was right in Hyatt and it was perfect! Never had to use the car! Checkout was quick and without any problems.Boarding passes can be printed from computer in the lobby. We will make many more visits here, because there was not a single thing that I could possibly complain about. Everyone from Ken and Fred all the way down to the cleaning staff always had a smile and always greeted us, nobody was ever nasty. Sadly I did not get to use the spa, but a few people we met there had used it and loved every minute of it. Yes the hotel is compact but Key West itself is not a big place. We never found a problem finding a spot to lay out in the morning. Usually we would go walking at 8am and come back to the hotel by 10am and get some sun till about 2pm and then head out for some lunch at the Harbor, come back, hang out by the bar and then go out for the evening sunset celebrations. The pool is not big but it serves its purpose and there is also a hot tub. The turtle pond is beautiful and well maintained. Also they have a large HD tv off the pool in which you can watch sports late at night after the bar closes, which for us was wonderful. The bar has two HD Tv's. The bar was open from 11am to 10pm while we were there. There is many chairs to sit at throughout the hotel in which you can sit and sip a drink enjoying the gorgeous view.

This was my second stay and I posted a review also after the first stay one year ago in where I basically praised the hotel (and you will find me doing this also in this review) however last year the front desk staff where not as friendly as one would have wished. Guess what, this year they where absolutely wonderful and we loved the stay every part from the world class check in experience (thanks Libby for providing an excellent check in feeling for us!) to the tasty and exclusive breakfasts that we just loved so much (thanks Carina for excellent service and friendliness!) for those of you who consider staying here, this is what you get; a completely remodeled hotel situated right by the sea and with a true exclusive resort feeling. The rooms as lovely and large and have balconies. There is a heated pool and a very comfortable hot tub. We had a reservation for a partly ocean view room but were upgraded as platinum Hyatt Gold card members to a deluxe room with two balconies (one huge and one smaller) overlooking the lovely pool areas and with full ocean view as well! The beds are so comfortable and the linens (I know, I am all in to the details) where top quality and starched to make you sleep like a king/queen! The design of the bathrooms will impress you and they are large and feature a walk in rain shower, top quality towels and exclusive amenities. Our room had a Nespresso coffee brewer (I think the regular rooms have ordinary coffee brewers though) and we had our room perfectly serviced each day including a shut down service for the night. There is wireless Internet all over the hotel for a cost (free for Platinum Gold card members) and parking is an additional 12 USD per night which considering this is Key West where parking is very expensive is not too much I think. I tried their Spa this year and highly recommend! The Spa is truly unique and with great staff (thanks Erin and Jana, you are true professionals!) The hotel is situated just by all the fun and crazy action of Duval Street and Mallory square but still secluded and quiet. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss visiting Key West and spoil your selves by staying at this world class exclusive hotel where the staff makes you feel not only more than welcome but truly like if you belong!

We especially liked the walk-in shower. All the photos you see on TA are accurate relative to the layout, decor of the rooms. Each room had a small frig, which was really great. We kept water, juice, and a few drinks in there, which was very convenient. Our only negative was it's probably time to start changing out the mattresses; the Hyatt Grand Bed was one of our draws to the Hyatt Resort and it was time for ours to be replaced. The staff was excellent from top to bottom. Every person we met was pleasant and accommodating. We felt genuinely welcome, unlike some staff that are simply gratuitous. Check in was a breeze, we arrived early and they immediately found us a room. Our flight didn't leave until 3:30 pm and we were given a late check out. i was very impressed with the staff. Here are some of our does and don'ts. Do: stay at the Hyatt - short walk to all the action; take the Conch Train tour; visit the Mel Fisher museum; eat at Blue Heaven, Salsa Loco, and A&B; go to happy hour at Half Shell Raw; eat breakfast every day at Pepe's (hey Ray); drink lots of water; use the taxi service when going to some of the distance restaurants or museums - relative cheap, quick and efficient; use the Fitness Center. Don't: fly/drive from Miami/Ft Lauderdale; rent a car (or for that matter a scooter/bike either) - just walk; eat dinner too early - most restaurants are \"al fresco\", which are cooling down between 7-8.

We have previously stayed at the Pier House, which we loved! Upon arrival we learned that our room was not ready. After being shown around the \"grounds\" (which are minimal at best) we learned that the pool was really a splash pool (the deepest point measuring 3 feet 9 inches), and the beach is essentially non-existent (maybe 6 lounge chairs) and you certainly can not go in the water... Eventually, we were shown to our room, where we learned, the refrigerator was really a \"cooler\" box and would not make your items cold, there are no robes in your room (despite what the website advertises), the extremely small balcony (which barely holds the two chairs and table overlooks the resort next door despite the room which room you reserved and paid for). During the week, the cleaning service simply forgot about us one day -- can not explain this at all... had to go and ask for fresh towels to shower after 5:15pm (ps: rooms are serviced between 8:30am and 5:00pm). By the way, the Hyatt has a number of properties in Key West and all of the guest from these properties are permitted to use the amenities at this resort during the day (ie: the \"pool\" and lounge chairs)... so if you do not go down in the morning and get a chair you may not have one with all the vistors from theother Hyatt's. This happened to us the first day. The bright spots are as follows: 1) the location is great; 2) room service (we ordered one night -- it was quick, good, efficient and the staff was friendly; and 3) the staff at the pool and bar (fyi -- pool bar closes at 11:00pm).

We were there during spring break but the hotel and the street where it is located were seemingly immune from the chaos we observed elsewhere. Our room was lovely (just as on the site but even better) and overlooked a small pool containing turtles and a water feature that effectively cancelled any noise. We even could see a bit of the gulf from our balcony. There was no table on the balcony to enjoy a cup of coffee and breakfast, though. The room decor was fresh and contemporary, a nice change from the dark espresso furnishings that are ubiquitous elsewhere. Although the mattress was good, the linens were a tad rough. Lots of pillows, however. The flat screen TV is situated in the sitting area (charming) and is not optimal for viewing from the bed. We enjoyed the coffee machine in the room, but it is set up to make only one medium paper cup. We loved the bathroom. The large walk in shower enclosure with both a rain shower head and hand held shower feature allow two to shower comfortably. Lovely toiletries: key lime soap and eucalyptus shampoo, conditioner, etc. BUT ladies, no shower cap. Towels are plentiful. We did have a problem with housekeeping. There was only one hanger in our room when we first arrived. Although I called housekeeping immediately and was promised hangers within minutes, they were not there when we returned 6 hours later and I had to make another call. The next day housekeeping left coffee stains and hair on the counters and did not replenish all towels. I called management and a two person team came immediately and surveyed the room. The situation was immediately rectified. Although we did not request it, by way of compensation, we were awarded points on our Hyatt card. We did not take advantage of the pool, restaurants, and bar but did walk around the area. It looked lovely. Check-out was at noon and the hotel was unable to give us a late check-out. We did, however, keep our bags in a secure area and the hotel permitted us to keep our car in the lot for the full day. We were also invited to use the hotel facilities, including the pool past check-out. We are of the view that many hotels have problems. The litmus test is how one handles them. We were well satisfied with the response of Hyatt to our concerns. If we could secure a good rate, we would defintely return.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "INDIANA", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable\u201d", "Author": "fromtheusa", "ReviewID": "UR25215641", "Content": "Just returned from a trip to Key West Flordia.

I was wrong the Hyatt was great - staff was wonderful and very helpful. Food / Bar / Pool and hot tub great. Room was fantastic. We had room #2208 overlooking the turtle pond. Concierge service on the property is very helpful and I recommend using them. They booked dinners, a fishing trip , snorkling trip for us (snorkling is not great - too cold and found out the sea is rougher in the winter months and we couldnt see anything - if you snorkle there do so in the summer when waters are calmer). I highly recommend spending the money to go deep sea fishing it was fantastic!!! Sailing there is also nice. My husband and I did use the spa - it is very nice, and ask for Gary he was wonderful.

The check in was easy and the staff did eveything to make our stay perfect, thank you Ms Agbaba. First what the Hyatt KW is; a large upscale chain hotel that felt like a boutique hotel. The rooms were modern beach, very clean and the bathrooms were as pictured-fantastic. Room service was always less than 30 min and the food from \"Shor\" was great. It has one of the best pool bars in Florida. The hotel is less than 5 min walking to Duval St and the \"Wharf\" is next door. There are bike/motor scooter rentals next to the hotel. The best aspect of this hotel is that you are close to everything yet it is an oasis from the madness that can Key West. Now for what the Hyatt is not: there is no beach to speak off but rather a \"sandlot\" and water. To be fair most of the hotels are this way as Key West is not a sandy-beach destination. The hotel has a few spectacular view rooms, many average/partial view rooms and a few bad ones i.e. next to elevators or over the bar. If the view is important then pay for the ocean front rooms. The west side of the hotel( bld #3) is next to the public sandlot beach that has been mentioned before. The hotel is on the main channel to the harbor and can be busy/noisy. It has two sunning areas, pool and sundeck both are very nice but limited bar service. The spa has two great masseuse(s) Erin and Lucy. Although the rooms were nice there was a great deal of outside noise due to the fact they faced a parking lot. Finally the rooms do have floor unit AC which worked well but always have a background hum. Bottom line we would go back again and stay here. My advice is to relax, slow down and walk around until you find a place that you want to dine in.", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "luvtravelluv", "ReviewID": "UR24738913", "Content": "The hotel was very nice.

So I always want to write positive reviews about Hyatt. I had a nice, not great 1 week stay at this hotel, great location, nice rooms, but for $665 a night I had expected a lot more, most of all better service. I would have rather spent this type of money at a 4 star beach front resort in Hawaii, or Miami Beach rather than at the Hyatt Key West. Thank god I was upgraded to a Deluxe Gulf Front King!!! FIRST THE GOOD:This place has just been recently renovated, and the rooms are very nice. I would say the bathrooms are the highlight with a walk in rain Forrest Shower. The room lighting comes with dimmers, a nice large plasma t.v., and a refrigerator. Dinning: I really enjoyed the food and service in both the restaurant and room service. LOCATION: All the attractions of Key West are with in walking distance. This place is a nice little Oasis right off the drunken circus and rowdy scene which is Duval Street. NOW THE BAD: There is no central air in the rooms, they are equip with the typical noisy wall air conditioning units you see at Hyatt Place or in standard motels. The fitness room needs to be renamed to The fitness closet no more than 3 - 4 people can use it at one time, IT'S WAY TOO SMALL!!!. The beach as well is too small, not kid friendly and just plan disappointing. SPA?? well where is it? not your typical resort spa. No business center or computer station. Housekeeping majorly sucks. This was a Hyatt first for me. Everyday I had to call down to get my room serviced, sometimes as late as 5:00 PM. On top of that there were ants in my room. 2 -3 hotel staff members actually knew how to say good morning, most of the staff lacked general hospitality skills. I would say the front desk was generally off in another planet. I had a wonderful check in but for the rest of the stay they were very unhelpful. I get better service at a local In and Out Burger joint here in San Francisco. In the end if Hyatt wants to charge these type of rates it needs to drastically improve service at this hotel, and provide better recreation facilities.

We were not disappointed - our ocean front room had a fantastic view of the water, palm trees, sunsets from all windows. We also had two balconies. Things to be aware of - many of which have already been mentioned here. Our room was in building 3 on the second floor right above the water sports desk, which meant that from about 9 am on there were lots of phone calls, some sort of air or fuel compressor running periodically, and the in/out of jet skis & boats. It is also right next to the public beach and the chatty parrot. For us, none of these things were a big issue and we did not try to move, but if you are looking for total serenity, the ocean front rooms in building 3 are probably not for you. We did have palm trees directly out our windows, but we thought they were pretty and added to the view. It was fairly cool during our stay, so we opted out of the beach/pool scene, in part because other than the small floating dock, much of the pool area is shaded, either by the buildings or by tented areas around the pool. If you are looking to bake in the sun for a few days, this may not be the best place. We intentionally wanted to be on the \"happening end\" of Duval Street and loved the location - walking distance to almost everything, but far enough away to be quiet at night. We did rent a golf cart one day to explore the \"quiet side\" of the island, Ft. Zachary Taylor, and our favorite, Louie's Backyard.

The hotel staff were wonderful to work with...each one went out of their way to smile and help with anything we were in need of. 2. Key West: My husband and I also rented a couple of small golf like cart cars and tooled around town. These were especially good when adventuring out to Hemingway's house and the Southernmost Point. There are also a couple of famous bars down that way( i.e. The Green Parrot). We had the time of our lives, much better than a moped. Each night we walked to Mallory Square for the Sunset and witnessed the most interesting street performer. He is known as \"The Cat Man\" his name is Dominique. He brought a smile to our face everynight with his show and his most interesting personality. His show and his \"kitties\" should not be missed! 3. Dining: There is no need to plan out your dining in advance. When strolling up and down Duval St all of the restaurants have their menus displayed out front. Take a gander and see what interests you. Each place has it's own personality. Two of our favorites were Salsa Loca and La Trattoria. We also vote Jack Flat's as the best burger (and we tried them all)! 4.

Probably would have been much cheaper to have eaten breakfast in one of the local restuarants. The hotel is idealy located for walking to all of the tourist attractions, with lots of restaurants in close walking distance. A good way to see all of the sites is to take a tour on the Conch Train. A must is Mallory Square and the pier at sunset. Hemmingways House is very interesting as well.

Shower water ran off a little slow, but that was my only complaint about the room. Balcony had two sliding glass doors & a large window in the middle of it. There were two chairs, two ottomans & a table with some plants. Bring a travel candle and sit out & watch the sunset, it was superior than to watching it anywhere else!! The sun ducked down between the two islands & there was no obstruction as you watched it sink below the ocean. Lots to watch from the balcony as well, boats, jetskis, etc. We even saw a dolphin jumping out a few times!! Beautiful. Galleon guests next door can be loud at times, but they are fun to watch. Lots of places to lay out in the sun - sun deck, small beach spot, pool area. My only complaint was that two different occasions they had to set up a private party on the sun deck or the small beach area. So, if you opted for the beach at 10:00 am (when there were plenty of chairs available at the pool) you were nice & comfy - until the catering manager comes over at around noon to tell you that in about an hour you have to go somewhere else!!!! If there was a sign stating this, I could have easily snagged a lovely pool lounger when there were plenty available at 10 am - but now at noon there were none!! This was really infuriating. Also, there was a private function one day on the small beach, the people attending the function all had towels & stuff at the pool chairs while they attended the function!

We stayed at the Hyatt Key West Resort and Spa because we've had above average experiences in the past - some great, some not so great. This was a safe bet for a hotel choice for a place we've never been. I want to provide a detail report on this resort as I think it would be helpful. All the reviews I've read had a generalized bent so this will give you every little detail you need to decide whether this is the hotel for you. The hotel is located on a fairly remote corner of Old Town, away from touristy Mallory Square and the famed Duval Street. It is the only one of few truly 4-star \"resort\" in Key West. It faces the Gulf of Mexico, and if you get a room with water view, it is truly one of the best places to stay. The Goods: 1) We had a 4 night reservation for a garden view room and upon arrival they only found 1 night (this is also bad) however in apology they upgraded us to a partial gulf and pool view for the entire stay for the price of a lesser room. 2) The room is immaculate, and with the $10 million renovations completed every room is perfectly appointed, clean, and modern. 3) The Pool - it is small but is comfortable to hang out in and around with many lounge areas to enjoy the sun 4) The view is wonderful if you have a gulf view room 5) Customer service is fairly good although don't expect something to be fixed immediately if, let's say your tv remote breaks. It takes a bit of time. 6) Water activities are provided directly at this hotel - you may launch right at their dock and go sailing, snorkeling, parasailing and jetskiing. Concierge handles all arrangement. This is a huge convenience because we didn't want to make calls and book reservations through the many charting companies in Key West. So our activity planning was effortless. 7) The turtle pond - wonderful turtles sunbathing and swimming happily in the pond. 8) late pool hours, you can swim until Midnight. The Not So Good: 1) This hotel is kid friendly, so you will find many kids screaming in the pool in all hours 2) The staff is only somewhat friendly. They are fairly ok but don't expect a warm aloha as you would in other island resorts. I am used to splurging on resorts so I'm used to top notched smiles from everyone who works at the hotel 3) The room's patio is ridiculously small on most rooms, unless you get the suite. 4) The prices are that of a 5-star hotel, not 4. This hotel is 4-star and doesn't fall short of that but at $650-$750 a night you will wish you didn't pay that much. 5) The renovations to the rooms and most of the facility are great. There are problem areas, such as the hallways which seemed a bit moldy. But being next the the ocean I think the hotel can't avoid such problems. But I would have liked it if they cleaned the doors, hinges, the handles a bit as it was a little rusty and dirty. 6) The hotel has a \"spa\" in its name- they have a spa called Jala but it is by all means, not a spa at all. It is a by-appointment-only service (massage, facials, wraps) and it is only a 2-room area within the hotel. You can't go there yourself and must have the concierge take you there. I find this hilarious that they overpromote themselves this way. I felt really misled because I really wanted to experience a real spa pampering service. 7) The hotel advertises two beaches - but they are not real beaches but rather, small sanded area with lounge chairs. This was also disappointing as well. 8) Key West is a drinking town, so two nights in a row we've had drunk disturbances (screaming, shouting at 2am) when I've had to call front desk to get security. 9) TV remote died and we've had to wait 2 hours for battery replacement. 10) Most people wrote in their reviews that there are no coffee makers in the room. But I found it! It's in a little photo box stuck in the linen closet on the top shelf. Unfortunately I found it the day we checked out! There you have it. I would provide pictures but it would be the same as everything out there which are pretty accurate depictions of the what it is.", "Date": "April 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGood option for Key West lodging - Great location/Spotty Service\u201d", "Author": "CAL777", "ReviewID": "UR14362865", "Content": "Had an overall nice 4 night stay at the Hyatt in early March with a few spotty service issues.

I enjoyed their fruit plate and some toast while my husband indulged in an egg dish. Food was good but service was slow. Unlike other Hyatt properties we've stayed at, they do not offer a breakfast buffet. The pool area bartender was friendly and quick to make a strong drink! In terms of negatives, front desk staff was young, inexperienced, and rather unprofessional. Hopefully Hyatt works on the customer service training here given that the hotel is a Category 5. We received a notice on our bed that our iHome alarm clock would automatically reset for Daylight Savings. This didn't happen and so we were late for a deep sea fishing excursion. We nicely notified the front desk of this and they said nothing other than yes that was a problem. Not the Hyatt standard that I am used to...

I could lay in my big bed and watch the boats pass by and neighboring islands, as well as the sunset. The pool was small and the beach smaller, but really it wasn''t that important since I mostly wanted to get a tan and there were numerous palces to get sun all day long. And the sun down there is intense, so be carefull and bring loads of sun block. Within a block were numerous excellent restaurants and shops with all sorts of menus. I especially liked being able to walk one block to the beginning of the main harbor and dockage area for Key West. There were lots of day trips to snorkel, dive, fish or just go for a sunset cruise. And the seafood at the dozen or so eating establisments was nothing less then excellent. A two block the other direction lands you at the foot of Duval Street, the central people watching street. Another block and you are at Mallory Square, home to the nightly sunset festival and freak show. The Hyatt had drawbacks in the strangest places for a luxury resort.

Nightly turn down was again sporadic. Seems a mangement problem from afar. The restaurant had a limited menu and the food was excellent, but service seemed at best amateurish and at worst it stunk! Employees were often from Eastern Europe (????) and English was NOT their first language. But this was something I found across Key West. Those emplyees that seemed to have been born in the US were snobbish and sometimes it seemed you had to beg (or maybe I shoulkd have bribed) the Concerige to get assistance. But OVERALL the place is awesome and these annoying glitches can be corrected through better magement and trainining, so I plan to return next winter and stay perhaps for 15 days.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cRenovations Are Done\u201d", "Author": "CarpeDiem45", "ReviewID": "UR12801659", "Content": "I have been following the reviews of the Key West Hyatt for some time as they unwent their renovations.

We had to call maintenance to our room to open our vault and even he was extremely courteous! We are AAA members and I included this infomation when I booked the hotel. This entitled us to receive coupons for a full-service breakfast each morning. Make sure you do this as you book your trip. It was delicious! The rooms are very spacious, sleek, and contemporary. The walk-in, huge shower was also very chic.. Walk in, sit on a stool, and let the water run over you as the stresses of life are erased. I had read there was no coffee in the rooms but we did have a coffeemaker that made individual cups to satisfy us until we made it over to the restaurant for breakfast. The location of the hotel cannot be beat! It is steps away from everything.....Duval St., Mallory Square,and restaurants. The power went out all over the island on Christmas night for a little over an hour. They said this ocassionally happens. Visit the Blonde Giraffe across the street for the best ever Key Lime Pie!!!

Probably the best thing about the Hyatt is the location - about a five minute walk to Duval St and Mallory Square (sunsets), and maybe five minutes the other direction to the marina for fishing charters, sunset cruise, snorkel trips, and what we thought was the best seafood restaurant among the many we tried (Conch Seafood). We walked all over Key West including from the Hyatt all the way up Duval to the other side of the island (Southernmost Hotel, southernmost point, Casa Marina) and really liked being at the Hyatt for the short walk to everything. The pool is adequate but does not get much sun after about 1pm so be aware of that. They do have a small sun deck which is quiet and relaxing and a good place to snooze in the sun. There are also jet ski rentals and parasailing right off the Hyatt's pier so you don't have to go far for activities. We can't comment on the food as we never once ate there (too many other interesting choices within an easy walk) but the poolside bar is an ok place for a drink.

Hotel has serious service issues from bellman, check in, housekeeping, room service, cafe people etc. The issues were raised with the front office and only your experience will tell if they took root.

My opinion is under $300 OK, over $300 and you may feel cheated in what the hotel can deliver. Santiago Bodega and Blue Heaven in a hardscrabble neighboorhood about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. Santiago is a charming Tapa style restaurant-excellent. Blue Heaven(breakfast starts at 8am) is a fun place with excellent food and service and serves BLD.

The hotel was supposed to be undergoing renovation but we were not inconvenienced at all. The restaurant and fitness center were both open and although one building was having roof work done it was very quiet. Swimming pool is more of a cocktail pool since it is only 3 ft. to 4 ft. deep. Not a problem for us but might be for some. The beach area is very small (typical for Key West) and right off the pool. They have a nice floating swim/sunning platform there too. Location was great. One block off Duval and very close to the Waterfront area with shops, boating and restaurants. The expensive part - the restaurant prices were high considering the food was just OK. Fortunately we had free breakfast coupons or our breakfasts each day would have been around $60 to $70 for the 4 of us.. Lunch was also pricey and food was again just OK. Our rooms rates were $420 for the first night and $454 for the next two nights. You can stay at the Ritz on the Concierge Level for less than that!

They run a deal where you stay 3 nights, and get the 4th night free. The place is undergoing construction on their lobby, spa, exercise facility, and gift shop, but the noise/workers didn't bother us at all. We had a lovely room with a plasma TV, balcony overlooking the pool, and a rain-head shower. The pool and beach are on the small side, but it was never crowded, and both were a much-needed relief after the hot days. The Blue Mojito Bar served up some mean drinks - we liked the Dirty Banana and Mudslide - both tasted like ice cream milkshakes with a touch of alcohol. The location is a huge bonus! It is within walking distance to Mallory Dock, the beginning of Duval Street is a block away, and the Historic Seaport is just around the corner. The only downside to the facility was the housekeeping. We would come back from a long day at the pool wanting a made bed and fresh towels, and find that our room had not been cleaned yet. It was usually cleaned around 3:30 or 4:00 in the afternoon, which is getting a little late for our tastes. Other than that we had a fantastic stay. They offer parasailing at the beach dock so we did a tandem sail one morning (go in the morning as it is cheaper). As for Key West itself, the town is so relaxing and fun. I would highly recommend the following places/events: 1. Trails of Margaritaville tour - If you're a Jimmy Buffett fan, then you'll love this tour. It stopped at all of the bars Jimmy used to play at, including our favorite the Chart Room Bar at the Pier House Hotel, you get to see the recording studio where Jimmy recorded License to Chill, and it ends at Margaritaville Cafe. If you go, ask for Tim as your tour guide - he's awesome! 2. Fury Catamaran Commotion on the Ocean - This was a sunset cruise aboard the Fury Catamaran and it included the house band from Hog's Breath Saloon. The drinks flowed and the music was great. 3. Sunset at the Top - If you get tired of the crowds and heat at Mallory Dock, head up Duval Street to the Crowne Plaza Hotel (right next to Margaritaville Cafe) and go up to the top floor. They have a bar and a huge balcony where you can watch the sun set. Great views! 4. Historic Seaport - This was an overlooked part of Key West until a few years ago. We thought it was very cool with all of the bars, restaurants, and boats. Schooner Wharf Bar and Conch Republic restaurant are in this area and come highly recommended. 5. Restaurants - Key West has so many restaurants and bars, that it was hard to pick which we'd go to, but I'd say the following were our favorites. Rooftop Cafe (corner of Front Street and Duval) for elegant scenic dining, Croissants de France (farther up on Duval) for awesome crepes and breakfast sandwiches, Antonia's (on Duval) for great Italian food in a cozy and comfortable atmosphere, Blue Heaven (off Duval) for breakfast amongst the roosters, chickens, and cats, and Sloppy Joes. I know Sloppy Joes is a tourist trap, but we thought the food, atmosphere and drinks were second to none. If any of you are thinking about driving down, I'd highly recommend it. We flew into Fort Lauderdale and the trip was so relaxing and fun. I'd recommend stopping at Lor-E-Lei's for lunch and Robbies to feed the tarpon in Islamorada. On the way back, we had lunch at Sundowners in Key Largo and thought the water and views at Anne's Beach (bring your suits) were great.

I told him that I used my key card and I got in fine, but he insisted that the lock could be broken into unless he replaced it. After several attempts at trying to make the new lock work, he gave up and I repacked, and he moved us across to the other side of the property to another room.

The maid service was slow getting to our room everyday.stopping by our room late afternoon when we were trying to take a nap or get ready for the evening. Out of the 4 days we were there, she only cleaned the bathroom (not the bedroom area) once! I asked for shampoo and towels every day. For $425 a night, that was unacceptable. Also, the fitness center was a joke. They had 2 elliptical trainers, 2 treadmills and 1 cycle, and one rack of hand bar bells. Also, the equipment was old and needed servicing. I heard other guests complain to the receptionists, who were very nice throughout the browbeating they were taking from this one guest, who was livid about the condition of his room and quality of the food in the restaurant.

My friends and I were very excited because I had stayed at a Hyatt in Washington, D.C. and EVERYTHING was incredible there. Sadly, our stay at the Hyatt Key West Resort and Marina was absolutely horrible! When we arrived, they did not have rooms ready for us and said it would be a few hours. Since we arrived at noon, that was understandable. The manager said we would be staying in brand new rooms that had just been completed. I specifically ASKED if there was construction going on in the building and Jon replied, \"They are only painting.\" That was a total lie. We were awakened every morning between 7:00-7:30 a.m. of our stay to the sounds of drills, hammering and construction. There were construction people coming and going out of our rooms at all times. I came out of the bathroom one time (which is near the door) wrapped in a towel and saw the door shutting. I asked my friend rooming with me if someone was in our room and she had gotten up to investigate too because she heard the door open! Construction people constantly knocked on the door. They would always apologize saying, \"Sorry, we didn't know anyone was in this room.\" The room itself was beautiful but not completed. The drain in the shower kept stopping up, the water was white (yes, white, we were told it wouldn't hurt us), there was a waterfall coming from the floor above over the balcony drenching the brand new furniture so we couldn't sit in it, there was no phone, there was a place for a refrigerator but no fridge. When we complained, we were told they could not move us because the hotel was booked for the boat races. Also, a very rude young lady at the desk, who should seek employment in another field - I think collections would suit her better - told us that because we booked our trip through a \"discounter\" (which is apparently the new name for \"travel agent\") they could not compensate us. An equally inept young man, said that we would need to TELL them what we wanted before they could do anything. I could not believe the stupidity of the staff. They gave us each a free drink voucher and a voucher for dinner at the restaurant. The dinner was wonderful, the experience at this hotel was not. Our \"discounter\" got us reimbursed for one night's stay but to be on a trip that you have looked forward to all year and end up staying at this - supposedly - top notch hotel and have all of these problems...well, I think you know how you would feel. It was simply not enough and the staff just did not care at all. No one would even apologize. Not all of the staff was worthless, though. The concierge we booked our snorkeling trip through was absolutely wonderful. So was the staff at the restaurant. I would never stay here again except maybe if there was a new manager and the front desk staff is fired, and the rooms are actually finished, it might be a decent place to stay.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunny, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautiful.

Well I can happily say that if it were me, I would never, ever, stay anywhere but the Hyatt Key West Resort and Marina. This beautiful resort is located on Front Street, and is no more than a 2minute walk from Mallory Square, Duval Street and The Historic Marina. It has it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own private beach, which is small, but perfectly adequate for a bit of a sunbathe, building of a sandcastle or swim in the warm gulf out to the floating sunbeds. You also have a private marina where you can go on sunset cruises, snorkelling trips or out on Jet Skis. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wana get sandy you can sunbathe on comfy sunbeds, with decent towels and good service by the pool and spa. A lovely little area to catch some rays and chill. There is everything else you could want from a top class hotel, a shop, bar, restaurant, and gym, but also little things that make this top hotel feel extra special, and fitting on the island. Terrapins in a pool and a McCoy parrot called Odie who sits on the trees by the beach. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strange, but staying at the Hyatt is a bit like staying at a friends, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s familiar and cosy and you feel like home, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something a bit different and special. You get everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from one of the worlds best hotel chains, but in a style completely in keeping with the island. The rooms are fabulous, with large balconies, unbelievable views of the sea and exceptionally comfortable beds. The colour scheme brings some quirkiness to the room, the massive flat screen TVs look cool, and the bathrooms are mind blowingly beautiful. The best bit is the proper robes, and the high-class toiletries, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you expect from a hotel like this, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not disappointed.

There were saws and grinders and hammer drills going all day long. One morning the workers were grinding bolts off of our balcony wall at 8:30am. Our room was actualy shaking and a crack appeared in the wall.

We asked to check out early, they said there would be an early check out penalty(besides during spring break its not easy to get another hotel) We asked for some sort of discount, but were turned down.

The pool was small and always crowded - we never got to sit by the pool. The restuarant was pricey so we never tried it although they did have a Christmas day breakfast buffet which was pretty good. A few days into our stay, we noticed a promotion offer valid for limited time (including the days that we stayed at the hotel), at the lobby, which stated that if we booked using AAA membership, we were entitled to free daily breakfast. My husband had used his AAA code while booking. However when we asked the hotel about this they said that we were not entitled to the said offer since the appropriate boxes on the booking had not been checked. We had made the reservation 6 months back when the offer was not even displayed on the website. We were very unhappy with the way the management totally denied us something that we were entitled to.

So we ate there almost every day that we were there. All in all, we did not get value for our money, were disappointed with the Hyatt, and would not stay there again.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but not worth Cat 4 points or $$$\u201d", "Author": "vmonk", "ReviewID": "UR4316284", "Content": "I'm normally very satisfied with Hyatts but we're just back from the Hyatt Key West (401 Front Street) Dec 2005 and it REALLY should not be considered a Category 4 by Hyatt. We were told we were upgraded to one of the best rooms & views in the resort (I'm a Diamond level member with Hyatt). Even then, we found there was little walking room with the 2 double beds making the room very crowded, a tiny balcony, everything needed updating (bathrooms, etc.), a/c is via a noisy wall unit...the pool area was tiny and crowded, there's no RC and the breakfast was pretty meager. We did have a partial gulf view which was nice. I'm guessing the location is the main reason for the high rating, but given the lack of resort level accommodations and amenities, I don't feel this hotel meets Cat 4 standards and wouldn't pay the $300+ rate we found online. I'd read other reviews on various web forums and found many others were disappointed in this Cat 4. My expectations were already lowered by their feedback, but I was still very disappointed by the hotel. By the way, the staff was very friendly and accommodating and this is in no way a reflection upon them. The tourist areas of Key West are small so you can walk almost anywhere. We did have ants in the bathroom as others have mentioned in previous postings, but it wasn't an infestation so we didn't bother the front desk about it.", "Date": "January 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeware of Hyatt Key West Timeshare\u201d", "Author": "VeryUnhappyGuests", "ReviewID": "UR4070144", "Content": "My wife and I paid a $475 deposit for a four night stay at the Kew West Hyatt Timeshare resort to be used the first week of November (Meeting of the Minds). Hurricane Wilma went through our community in Southwest Florida and damaged our business, additionally, it devistated the Miami and Keys with power outage, flooding and curfews. We called to cancel our stay, as wee needed to attend to our business and could not go and we were very concerned about the conditions and lack of power and gas for a trip to Key West, but were told by the Hyatt organization (located in Illinois) that it is beautiful there and nothing is wrong in Key West. All major news organizations report a completely different situation. Many areas in Key West, the lower Keys and Miami are still without power, water and gas. They refused to give us our money back, I called four times, was put on hold for a \"supervisor\" three times and waited in excess of 15 minutes, each time the phone was never answered. The fourth time a supervisor answered and told me he needed approval from his supervisor, and would call me no later than 24 hours later (Friday, Oct 28 at 5pm). They did not call forcing me to fill a complaint with the State of Florida and State of Illinois. This is the last thing that I expected from a Hyatt resort. I was treated rudely, lied too, made false promises and disrespected. I would urge anyone considering investing in a timeshare with Hyatt to look at another organization such as Marriott to purchase their vacation home. I am not even an investor but a prospective investor, and this is how they treat you.", "Date": "October 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great staff, Great local, Great food, GREAT!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "joecaDublin", "ReviewID": "UR4053018", "Content": "I dont care what the other reviews say, the hotel & staff and everything else was absolutly top notch.
