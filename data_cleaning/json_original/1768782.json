Tipping is normally discouraged in Singapore but staff at this hotel expect it and wait for it with their hand extended. Reception staff give the bare minimum of service and were not very helpful.

A male staff on duty when we checked in was not friendly at all..in fact bordering on arrogant. The other female staff was at first friendly but when questioned about why we still could not check in at 4 pm (one hour after check-in time), she showed signs of arrogance too. I needed a lot of patience to keep my cool. I booked and fully paid our hotel room about 2 weeks before arrival date, but when we got there, they could not even give us a room number, much less inform us what time we could check in. Their check out time is 12 noon. That's more than enough time to clean the rooms for the next occupant. But we had to wait another 4 hours for us to check in. It is also true that the room is basically bare of essential food like - coffee, tea, drinks or snacks which you usually find in hotels upon check in. Drinking water? Bring your own. Hotel lay-out? The Podium Block is an extension of the main hotel - acceptable. But they locked the main lobby entrance on the ground floor and so guests have to make a roundabout thru the elevators which can at first be confusing - go up the 4th from the main lobby, cross the bridge, take another elevator to the 2nd, then walk farther down the corridor - too bad if your room is at the very end. Housekeeping staff in the corridors are sometimes very noisy with their conversations and laughter. They can be heard from inside our room. SUGGESTION: Most of the hotel staff should be given rigid training on good manners, and a proper and pleasant attitude in difficult circumstances. One hardly sees them smile - a very important factor in making guests feel welcome and more at home. They should remember that their salaries come from the hotel guests and not from their managers. BUT, in fairness, the following make up for the negative points: 1) the lobby is presentable and spacious enough (although with not enough seats). 2) there is a coffee shop right in the lobby for the really hungry. 3) a desk manned by very amiable tourist consultants is positioned in the lobby. 4) since it is a relatively new hotel, bathrooms are very clean with daily cleaning schedules and change of towels everyday with no need to request. 5) the male staff in red T-shirts assigned at the lobby to assist guests were quite friendly and helpful. But they don't bring your luggage for you up to your room...unless perhaps if you are carrying loads and loads of luggage. 6) hotel location in Little India is quite convenient and accessible for most tourists who love to walk around For tourists like us who are out of their rooms the whole day, there is no reason for us to pay 5-star rates. 3-star hotels should be good enough for sleeping and resting purposes during the night, so these hotels should try their best to make the guests most comfortable and pleased with the attitudes and services of the staff.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ghaziabad, India", "Title": "\u201cNot recommended for enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "VinodKTyagi", "ReviewID": "UR122134661", "Content": "Rooms too small with bare minimum furnishing, room service;non existent at all, No drinking water, forget about tea and coffee.

The kindest word I could think of regarding this hotel is unusual. Where do I begin.... How about the out of the ordinary check in and breakfast times. There was a sign on the reception desk saying that the Check out time is 12 PM, Check in time is 3PM, and Breakfast time start from 7-10 AM. Probably I should ask why the unusual time because The room clearly did not reflect the three hours worth of efforts dedicated to it and it didn't seem to take that much time to prepare the breakfast buffet. The was room pretty much bare, no teas, no coffee, no drinking water, and limited channels on the tv. My Room had black smudges on the wall, and while talking about the wall, I could hear what my neighbours were talking and watching because the wall was quite thin. The Interior design is unusual, the bed and the shower is separated by a glass, Fortunately I stayed alone, so I didn't have the awkward instances where I was lying on the bed and I could see my room mate silhouettes in the shower. My room located in a different building than the reception, so I needed to take a lift to the 4th floor crossing the bridge, to access another lift and went down a floor (my room was in the 3rd floor), vice versa, so it was very annoying. My room was directly behind a Hindu temple so I could see the intricate detail of the temple and peeked on their worship. In the morning the temple rang a bell so you have a morning call (too bad if you want to sleep in) The breakfast... I think they had a contract with a caterer because there were no kitchen anywhere near the breakfast room (located on 8th floor of the reception building, so I needed to take a lift to the 4th floor, crossing the bridge, took the lft to 8th floor). The food range was limited, just bread, rice, curry, sausages, vege spring rolls, baked beans, fruit, tea, coffees n water; Only the water, rice and vege spring rolls were edible to me. The breakfast is small, I'm pretty sure if a quarter of the whole occupants of the hotel decided to have breakfast at the same time, some of them have to wait for a table; Well, there's a 7/11 right downstairs outside the lobby. Despite the negatives about the physical aspects of the hotel, the biggest problem was the staff. A housekeeping staff sat on the floor on the hallway of my floor, and reception and concierge staff were unhelpful. I have two specific examples of how unhelpful the concierge and reception staff were (In hindsight, I don't know whether they were unhelpful or unknowledgable). When I arrived at the hotel, I asked the concierge how to get to the MRT station and He told me it was better to take a taxi to my destination, but I decided to walk a little bit and I saw an MRT sign, after following the sign, I reached Little India MRT station. The second example was when I needed to change my SGD1000 bill into smaller currency. I asked the reception staff whether she could help me with that and she said they didn't have that much cash with them, Fair enough, but she said to me to try the numerous restaurants surrounding the hotel. I knew that was a bad suggestion so I tried several gold and jewellery stores on the Serangoon St, until I found the only money exchange stall that could help me. Thanks God, I checked out right after breakfast and straight to my conference, because I couldn't stand it anymore!

Even after several attempts, the reception could not correct it!! Finally, after 45 minutes,we could reach our rooms through a security guys card!! The hotel has a very strange lift system, if you stay in the podium block rooms. The main lifts get very crowded at times due to faulty cards and strange connecting systems. Hotel staffs are almost non-existent and non co-operative, except the very efficient and help concierge guys in red and colorful travel desk guys. Podium rooms are ok with basics but far less than a USD130 per night hotel. No minibar for which we were asked to pay a deposit before! Room views are ok. The hotel is very popular with group tour operators from South Asia, as a results, common areas like reception, lobby, breakfast etc get crowded. Hotel offers a very basic complimentary breakfast with water down juice, tea and coffee between 07.30 to 09.30. at 09am, one needs to serious struggle for a piece of toast.

The food was horrible ( that was an understatement according to me). The bellboys refuse to deliver or pick the luggage. They don't give complimentary water (which we thought was the most basic thing as they gave complimentary Shampoo & Soap!!). The room service wont give plates as they do not allow outside food, even in the rooms!. and yes, before that when you call reception, it goes to room service, when call room service it goes to the operator....There was tea/coffee maker in the room but no water, tea bags, milk or sugar (more like a decoration piece!). The hallway carpet was full of dust...as if the whole of Singapore came here everyday to wipe off their shoes. The most shocking part was the day we checked out... my friend requested the reception executive to send someone to bring our luggage down to the lobby, (an hour before the check out time, which was 11 am). The Personnel said that all the bellboys were out for lunch and would be back by 2 pm ( 3hours long lunch time!! Awesome isnt it?)... so how do we get our luggage (7 bags to be precise)... he asked us to get one bag down at a time (5th floor to ground via a passage way which connect one building to the other... so from 5th floor u go to 4th then use the passageway to go to the other building take the lift from their to reach the reception... this was because the lifts weren't working for past one month or so...)

They don't smile and one receptionist looked as if she was 'scared' to ask what our needs were. She didn't seemed happy to be working there. We had a standard room and to get there, we were surprised we had to take the lift up to the 4th floor, walk across a bridge, take another lift down a level before arriving at our room. Quite a trek! And it's the only way in and out of the place. We were given a room directly behind the Hindu temple and the two days we stayed there, we were woken up VERY early in the morning by the prays, chanting and bells ring from the temple. It went on for quite awhile. So needless to say we didn't get much sleep the first night, after arriving at the hotel at 1am. This was repeated the next morning, so we were very annoyed! The walls/doors are not very sound proof and it can get very noisy. Luckily we only stayed 2 nights. I got cold during the first night, so the next day I asked for an extra blanket. Reception said they didn't have any to spare, but could offer me a sheet instead. However, it would cost me $10 for the hire.... I declined. Taxis didn't know where the hotel was situated and thus catching taxis from the place was near impossible. We had to ring up for one. So overall a bad experience for us.

The hotel is not secure because they don't have any security personnel on each floor and even in the lobby, so I think even though your not a guest there, you can roam around the hotel anytime you want. Also, they don't have complimentary water, coffee, sugar, creamer, and tea. Which is really unusual. They charge extra towel, tootbrush, everything! Their restaurant service is really slow, according to the people who ordered so we did not pursue with ours. There are a lot of Indians talking as a group after midnight in the hotel corridor and some of the men are topless which is really scary especially if your a female approaching to your room alone. Of course the hotel is in Little India, if you're not a fan of Indian food, don't stay here. Well, the hotel has 711 beside it. Also the hotel is 5-min walk to MRT (Little India Station).

Prayers chanting starts early in the morning before sun rises. Staff are rude and are totally ignorant of you. Pathetic ! Outside the hotel, you can see Indians (foreign migrant workers) hanging on the streets like swarm of bees, some of them sitting by the road sides and junctions, some of them walking on the street itself ignoring traffic turning into the hotel.
