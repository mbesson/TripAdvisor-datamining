Horrible....HORRIBLE customer service. She never took off her Ipod at any time while helping me and seemed to be outside more than at the desk. She also talked to guests while eating which was rather repulsing. She spoke very ignorantly to some of the other guests and to me about some of the other guests being annoying or stupid and how much she couldn't stand them. Totally inappropriate. If I were her manager, I would fire her immediately. The WORST customer service I have ever experienced in my life.

Here's why: First: Do not, I repeat, DO NOT get either of the two rooms that are directly above the lobby. The high ceiling and marble walls of the lobby create such a din inside your room that it sounds like you're sitting around an indoor pool. At one point in the afternoon, it was so loud that I had to check to see who was making all the noise. Unbelievably, it was only the desk clerk checking in ONE customer. The echo in the lobby (and into the room) made it sound like 20 people. I am not kidding. Then, around 11PM, a youth group of about 30 were in the lobby. You could not even hear the TV in my room during their (lengthy) check-in. Secondly: Parking is always a problem, especially downtown, which I certainly understand. Since I knew was getting back to the hotel very late, I asked what the options were if the lot was full. I was told that \"there are 28 spots, and we only give out 28 parking passes, so you should have no problem.\" Of course, that NEVER works, and I needed to park on the street when I came in late. No problem... it's happened to me many times at many downtown hotels. But here's the problem: When I went to the desk in the morning to request the parking fee be charged-off on the account (because it was full), I was given somewhat of a 'lecture' to the effect that I should've immediately \"reported it\" to the desk upon my return to the hotel. I responded that \"that particular rule was not addressed\" when I checked-in. (Had to give a little bit of 'tude back to the agent!) Anyway... It was charged-off, but I remember the 'lecture' more than the courtesy they gave me by not charging me. Without the little bit of attitude on the parking, I would've probably given the hotel a 5. If they would've mentioned that the room they had assigned me was very (no, make that \"incredibly\") loud, again I would've given them a 5. I really feel that they should make it a policy to mention that fact before they assign the room. (As a side note: At many hotels where I stay that have a nightclub in the hotel, I offer to take the rooms closest to the club, because working nights, I'm out of the hotel before the music starts, and come back in after the club is closed. I do this as somewhat of a courtesy to the hotel, because I'm sure the noisy room is hard to sell. Too bad this hotel didn't give me the same courtesy. Everything else was fine... Spotlessly clean... HUGE rooms... Close to downtown and many attractions. I should also say that when I mentioned the noise in the room to the desk clerk, he quickly offered to move us into another room, but we were already settled-in and unpacked, and thought the noise would subside a bit. We should've taken him up on the offer. One more thing - the lobby, which was obviously once an old bank building, as noisy as it was, was absolutely beautiful. Wait 'til you see it. Very impressive. I'll stay there again... But certainly not in that same room!", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cBaseball, Bachelorette, Baltimore\u201d", "Author": "Classic4", "ReviewID": "UR125340278", "Content": "My girlfriends and I have stayed at this hotel twice, both during summer trips to see Redsox vs. Orioles series.

The hotel is built in an old bank so the lobby is beautiful. The room we had was a very nice hotel room - no maintenance issues and nicely decorated.

I stayed there the first night and the last two nights. My husband stayed the entire time. We got the patient rate from Johns Hopkins. If you are there for the hospitals, check with their guest services staff as they can help with this hotel and others in the area. This hotel was about 10 minutes from the hospital parking garage. They also charged lower parking fees than other downtown Baltimore hotels (more on that below). They run a complimentary shuttle for going back and forth to the hospital and other nearby areas. My husband enjoyed the complimentary breakfast every morning - especially the pancake maker. Said the variety of items was very good. I wasn't really up to eating much. I will say how much I appreciated the staff. The young woman at the desk went out of her way to help us with hospital planning and our car arrangements. She helped us with directions to the local drug store for stuff I needed and to other shopping. I think her name was Samantha - she was a dynamo. The downside for this hotel was the neighborhood was definitely inner city. Not much close by and many of the guests were using the shuttle to other areas. The shuttle was popular. Also, we were warned to clear everything out of our car as the lot next to the hotel was a target for local crime. The parking lot has limited spaces. They try to control this by only accepting enough cars for their 28 spaces but you know how people can be taking up extra spaces. Something to check on - you may not get a parking space. HINT: Go park in Johns Hopkins outpatient center lot (a few blocks over) and have the shuttle take you back and forth. If you get the discount tickets, the cost is $5 for parking 24 hours and their deck is more secure. You just have to wait for the shuttle or take a cab.

It's less than a mile to the aquarium and a little over a mile to Camden yards and both directions seemed safe for foot traffic till after dusk, just don't walk north past the police station after dark but there is nothing of interest in that direction anyway. You need to know that outside of the inner harbor and university center everything looks like homeless town in this city but cabs are a decent alternative to walking if it's after shuttle hours and if you look around you can find a Prius cab and go green.

About the parking, they have a small parking lot in which they charge $12.00 a night, but you have to get there early, it is a first come first served parking lot. If you are not lucky enough to park in their lot you will have to pay to park on the street. The street is not too busy and there is a big police presents since there is a police station not too far away. So I believe it is safe to park there. The hotel offers a free breakfast which includes hot items (eggs, sausage, bacon, etc) also juice, milk, fruit, yogurt plus alot more. One down side to the hotel there is no convenience store or pharmacy close by so you will have to pick stuff up before getting to the hotel or venture out on your own in the city. In all, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants great service, clean room, and great value.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Hans47", "ReviewID": "UR61855559", "Content": "Old bank remodeled into a interesting little hotel.

Getting a room from Hotwire usually means you're near the elevator, but even so, the ambient noise from the hall was minimal. Also, my room was directly across from the highway - more or less just white noise, nothing intrusive. The hotel itself is off the beaten path, 1 mile in from the Inner Harbor. The area is a little rundown, but I never felt unsafe - I suspect the gentrification of Baltimore will be there soon. It's near the Hopkins campus and there are A LOT of people walking around during the day, with a constant police presence. I did not go down for the complimentary breakfast (630a-9a), but the all day coffee/tea service was good.

Overall I was very satisfied with the room -- the hotel was super clean, the staff really nice, and it was a real perk to get free breakfast. Maybe it's just continental, but there was a lot of variety -- eggs, several types of bread products including cinnamon buns, cereal, oatmeal, sausage, bacon, biscuits. There were a variety of hot drinks available downstairs all day, too, which was also nice. In terms of service, somethings were a bit disorganized -- I tried to print something out, and they had no idea where it was being printed from. They ended up printing it out for me, and at no cost, so I can't really complain, though. (It was honestly a lot of papers, so I actually really appreciated it.) Though they have a 'shuttle', it's really just a company van, and they can only get you around if the person is there (and available). Thus I got to use the van twice, and had to walk downtown twice. This isn't the hotels fault, really, but the taxi they asked to come back for me didn't come back, and there weren't any around, so I ended up being a bit late for one of my events, too. Which brings me to the question of location. I was a bit concerned when I found out where it was -- it's in the downtown area, but honestly it's a couple of blocks away from the main strip, and you have to walk under the highway to get to it. At morning and during the day this isn't a problem, and I felt very comfortable walking downtown. At night, though, it's pretty dark and relatively isolated. I walked back when it was just seven and felt OK, but the other night I ended up taxing it back, so you might want to keep the taxi money in your budget. It's not expensive, though -- about 5 to 6 dollars to the convention center. However, the really bad thing about the location is that there's no place to eat around it, as far as I could tell. The hotel offers free coffee and drinks downstairs all the time, but there weren't any restaurants nearby, and you'd have to walk a decent bit to even get to a store to sell you something. It's definitely important to get what you want before heading back, though those with cars may not be concerned. Overall, I'd say if you could get a deal like I did, it's definitely worth it and you'll be really satisfied. I got a great price, and am really happy with it. But if I were going to pay 110 dollars, I might choose to be at one of the hotels closer to the harbor which are about the same, just so I don't have to walk around to find food.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cNot safe - room doors don't lock.

I found this hotel from Priceline for one night - got a great rate and turned out to be a decent first day experience. Then I had to extend my stay by two nights (now at $112 per night regular hotel rates) because there was a huge snowstorm on the East Coast and my flight back home got cancelled. And that's when I saw how bad this hotel was. A couple of hours after I checked into my room I discovered that after I locked the door, it would not lock. (God knows how many people must've stayed in that room with a false sense of security!) And as it turns out, this hotel in within a few hundred yards of a juvenile detention center. Yeah right, now I am going to feel very cozy and safe! When I informed the front desk, they assigned me another room, the keys to which wouldn't open the room. Onward to another room,and the rest of the stay was uneventful. FInally I got back home. A couple of days later I discovered that I was charged for one night more ($112). When I called they said they couldn't find that transaction on their files. After a lot of agony and a lot of phone calls they said they will fix it. They didn't. I called up again and spoke to someone at the front desk who said she didn't have time to look into my file, but will do it later. A week later, instead of reimbursing me $112, they charged my credit another $224. What a circus! I called up again this morning. The person to deal with is still not in. Somehow, they don't care, they don't seem very competent and as a rule they never return your phone callsl All hotels have a manager who should be taking care of things when they get this messy. For this Holiday Inn Express either s/he doesn't exist or is not very interested in providing good customer service. Hello, are you there? If this review gets your attention, please return my money and feel free to call me. And please get a little more involved in how your hotel is being run instead of playing golf all day. By all means stay in this hotel if you feel like it - the rooms were good, but I didn't feel safe at all. Not to mention, that even though I have checked out almost 2 weeks ago and they still keep charging me for my stay there. Get the point?

It should be a flagship for Holiday Inn Express - an elegant bank building that has been sensitively refurbished with a particularly large and elegant lobby space. It also has a first rate staff team. The neighbourhood is 'up and coming', which means that it has a slightly edgy feel, but it is close enough to the Inner Harbor - about five blocks - to be confident that improvement will continue. Besides, it is only about one block from a major police post and patrol cars are constantly in evidence. However, what we Brits call the \"snagging\" process at the end of a big construction job has plainly not been done satisfactorily, if at all. Our room had a chipped bath, a badly scratched side panel on the bath, a loose faucet over the bathroom sink (tap over the basin), power circuit that did not function and rendered two lights inactive, and a loose leg on the studio chair. We were staying over a weekend so it was not unreasonable that some of these could not be fixed by maintenance, but they do raise issues both about building management and construction quality. If a plumber got away with fitting a chipped bath, or dropping a wrench into it and not replacing it, what does this say about construction standards - and what other problems are lurking? The front desk were charming and thanked us for our courteous reports - if we didn't tell them about problems, they couldn't be fixed. Well, there are consultants in the hotel business who do that sort of pre-occupancy checking - and I don't think they would miss a chipped bath. Is it really fair to expect customers to do that checking for you? Is it really appropriate to charge them quite a full rate for being the test-drivers? I do think this is a hotel with a good future - but I would track its reviews quite carefully to be sure that the problems reported by this, and other early reviewers, do actually get fixed.

It's a lovely building, and the room was of excellent quality. There were a few missing items; no general information about Baltimore, and no Guest Directory, but as I knew this was a relatively new hotel, I overlooked this omissions. What I can't overlook is what happened when I tried to do a load of laundry before I left. Unbeknownst to me, the guest laundry was not operational. As there was no indication AT ALL that this was the case (not even a simple \"OUT OF ORDER\" sign on the machines or door), I loaded the (apparently working) washing machine with my laundry and detergent, but could not start the machine. A call to the front desk confirmed that it wasn't working. This knowledge would have been helpful before I'd soaked my dirty laundry with detergent. As I had 90 minutes before I had to leave to get a bus to Philadelphia, I accepted the offer for housekeeping to do my laundry for me. Ninety long minutes later, I still didn't have my laundry back, and I had 20 minutes to get to the other side of Baltimore to catch my bus. Eventually after practically begging for my clothes back, they were returned (still wet) and despite the best efforts of the young man driving the hotel shuttle, I did indeed miss my bus and had to forfeit my prepaid fare, then fork out $70 for a train ticket in order to get to Philadelphia in time for a pre-arranged engagement. To say I was upset and disappointed is an understatement. If I was in Baltimore in a year's time and needed to stay close to the same venue, I'd consider it, but would probably stay elsewhere and fork out for the cab ride instead.
