I got to Montreal early in the morning, but spent the entire day out and about taking care of what I had come for - I ended up checking in around 5:00pm. I freshened up a bit for an hour or two, then left for dinner and a night out. I ended up getting back to the hotel at around 4:00am - so my experience was really limited to only Sunday morning - and yet, I still ended up with a really bad taste in my mouth. I had really unpleasant interactions with the hotel's staff from the moment I arrived, and was barked at for stopping in front of the hotel to unload my luggage (in the guest load/unload zone), all the way to check-out. I didn't take any pictures of the room, as it was identical to the pictures that are already up on this site. Instead, I have provided here two very condensed anecdotes of what I am referring to when I say that my experience with this hotel's staff was surprisingly disappointing. The information booklet in my room listed no information about room service for breakfast, but it did indicate that there was a little shop in the lobby that sold food. I just needed something quick and easy, so I figured I would just run downstairs and grab a muffin or something. The shop ended up being a closet and not having any food, which is fine. So I checked with the front desk if there was any way to get something sent up to my room. I spoke with a certain Andrew, who was incredibly condescending and rude. I was told that the only way to find out about what is available is to physically go to the restaurant and talk to them, as \"there is no food at the front desk that I can eat, clearly\". He said that he could not call the restaurant on my behalf and that if I wanted food, I would have to call from my room. On the way back to my room from this unexpectedly rude experience, I got stuck in the elevator. Now I realize that this is the fault of no one, I certainly do not blame it on the hotel staff. However, it is the way that they handled the problem that was so disappointing. We called on the emergency phone in the elevator and were connected to the front desk - they were rude and failed to appreciate how inconvenient (and potentially frightening) being trapped in an elevator for 30 minutes might be. The other guests and I were told that they would send someone to verify...The elevator continued to run up and down to various floors by itself, but would not open its doors. In the end, we got off at the 11th floor - and in the mean time, no one had been notified. More rude staff (cleaning) were trying to get in the elevator as we were getting off - indicating that not even staff had been notified of the situation, and providing yet another opportunity for unpleasant staff interaction. Look, the hotel itself is fine - the location is great, the rooms are clean (except for some unpleasant long hairs found in my bed), and the price is right. Just don't expect any more than that. Honestly, it takes very little for a hotel to be clean and well-located - it is the service and attention to detail that distinguishes one hotel from another. The staff at this property were more akin to an interstate motel than a four-star Hilton.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kendal, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hillton\u201d", "Author": "shawchessplayer", "ReviewID": "UR124347819", "Content": "We stayed on the 5th floor overlooking a road junction.

He kindly asked if this was my first time at the hotel, and since it was, he described the various features of the hotel and where to find them, and also asked me if I wanted a wake up call. I appreciated how he was proactive with this information and service. I had booked an \"executive suite\" because of an HHonors promotion. The extra room in the suite basically just held a table and four chairs, and a second TV, wet bar, and second fridge, so I guess its design is more for holding meetings than relaxing. As an HHonors Gold member, I was given two complimentary bottles of water every day, and I appreciated that the front desk clerk told me this so I didn't have any confusion if I would be charged for it or not. I was also given complimentary full breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. HHonors rules state that Gold members get continental breakfast, so this property went beyond by extending full breakfast. That included the continental breakfast buffet, as well as a cooked to order item (eggs any way, waffles, crepe of the day). The main server at the restaurant was extremely warm and friendly. Bed was comfortable, and I loved the walk-in shower. Other nice amenities are complimentary copies of the Globe and Mail, and a business center accessible by the room key where there were computers and a printer for guest use. The location is good. You can walk to Vieux Montreal in about 20-25 minutes, McGill is just a couple blocks away. The Place des Arts metro station is around the corner on the next block, and I also discovered several bus lines at the corner of the hotel (I used Google Maps to plot out bus routes using the \"Transit\" function).

Next time run to the Holiday Inn and grab something from their coffee shop - I think they have breakfast sandwiches for $2.99. Or try the cafe across from there - awesome hot chocolate!

This is simply the best bed I have ever slept in. My partner and I have different ideas of the perfect bed, but we both slept perfectly on this one. I can't ever remember a hotel room where I didn't have some adjustments to make in regards to at least one of: the room temperature and/or ventilation, the pillows, the bed, the linens or the noise levels. I had none of these problems in this hotel. We walked in, settled in, and fell asleep. It was so simple, just like it should be - and we are both light sleepers. Our room was facing the street. Unlike in almost all other hotels, the freezer in the minifridge actually works. It is a bit slow to freeze, but it does work. There were also plenty of accessible electrical outlets. Our room, a King, was absolutely huge. It included a couch, 2 armchairs, a hassock and coffee table as well as the designer desk chair. Excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water on the 7th floor A couple of minor issues. The lightbulbs were not really bright enough for me as bedside lamps. However, I did not complain about them. It's possible they would have offered better ones if I'd asked. But I do think stronger bulbs should be standard issue, especially in hotels which offer Seniors rates, as does this one. We did not requrest a disability-friendly room, but ours did have the disability signifier on the door. For those of you who may require this feature, please note that our room did not have a grab bar for the toilet, which it really should have. I am not sure if this was just our room or whether they are all like this, but if it is an issue for you, you should inquire about it. I would have appreciated a night light in the bathroom. Staff were friendly and accommodating although we did not have a lot to do with them. We did not try the food, so can't comment. 5 miute walk from the Place des Arts subway station. There was always a cab waiting at the door. Many restaurants in the area. The challenge for this hotel will be to see if it can maintain this level of quality as the years go by and the facilities age..

If you are coming by bus, please skip the next few negative lines: The garage is deep underground and unattended - I would never allow my wife or daughter to join me down there and certainly not allow them to go by themselves. Sublevel one, two and three are usually full, while sublevels 4 and 5 are reserved for local apartment renters. That leaves sub level 6 that is usually gated - they expect you to exit your car and find the dungeon phone to call the desk and have them send a person down to open the gate. Nothing like getting out of your car in an unattended, garbage- smelling, dungeon to use the wall phone. Then, once you find a spot 6 levels underground, you need to go through a series of poorly marked, poorly lit, doors to find the elevator. And, of course, they charge $22 per day for this awful adventure. Coming by bus? The lobby is great and the rooms are clean and adequate (although we had no view - just the hotel air conditioner.... pretty bad). The mattresses are not bouncy.... we jumped in and it felt like a sand box. It must be a new style because we did sleep ok. The bathrooms were meticulous and the shower was great. Hence, this is a mixed review (the price of $160/night prepaid was fair). I must say that the staff at the Hilton are truly great. Ruebens and Christopher are part of the concierge staff and there's nothing that they wouldn't do for you. Christopher spent a long time explaining how to get from Montreal to Ottawa and was truly a pleasant fellow that had me thinking positively about the Hilton experience.

You can print them from their wifi from your room but that system was temporarily down. Odd that the brochures wouldn't be prominently displayed or that the front desk would not make us aware of them either. They should. Lastly, this happens at all hotels, but it would be nice if you are booking a room for three people to have toiletries for three people in the room when you arrive instead of having to call housekeeping for extras.

I took the higher-up room, although it was right beside the elevator which I don't like (also indicated in my preferences). Good clean room, wider than usual as I think I got an accessible room, so that was appreciated once I realized it.

Microwave and empty bar fridge in the room, decent flatscreen TV but no HD channels and not much channel selection compared to other places I've stayed at.

It unexpectedly rained my last full day there; I came equipped for snow. The front desk was fantastic and had umbrellas available for a $40 deposit, which they charged to the room. Good big umbrella, and this was a great service. However, they neglected to record that I dropped it off so it was showing on the bill plus taxes when they slipped it under my door.

Our floor was wet every morning after we showered because the door did not close well and wasn't flush on the bottom so water could flow out. A minor complaint but it's the same in many hotels I stay. My only actual complaint is that the bed had to be the most uncomfortable I've ever slept in. Even with the mattress where you could change the stiffness we woke up with back pain every morning. The pillows were also enormous and fluffy making for an uncomfortable night's sleep.

As it was, we found the hotel very safe (key card needed to access the floors and garage) - in the rooms and in the garage - but they sure pulled all the tricks out of their sleeves that night. There was plenty of security and they were checking everyone that came into the hotel - making sure that they were guests and that there weren't many people going up to each room. It was very comforting that there were a couple of police officers there as well making sure that no one would come in and cause problems. This was especially nice in contrast to the Holiday Inn next door, where people standing outside were inviting people off the street to come in and party in their rooms with them. Overall this was a great trip and this hotel, staff and their management definitely helped make it that way!", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!, really nice Pool!\u201d", "Author": "VjackV", "ReviewID": "UR92028076", "Content": "I came to the Hilton garden Inn with my girlfriend for a weekend away from my roommates. We had a great time, We chose this hotel from all the positive reviews here on trip advisor. There are so many choices in Montr\u00c3\u00a9al and this one is a must. We got a King size bed that was a bit firm, but we found out from the front desk that all the mattresses are adjustable so we were able to change the softness of the bed. And had no issues there. Seeing is how it get so cold sometimes here we were very excited to use the indoor pool. Heated and clean. The only thing is we found out that it is shared with the apartments next door, which is less of an issue with pool but we noticed the gym was very busy at certain times. We went to see the front desk for some suggestions for diner. We stayed away from the hotel restaurant because we wanted something fancier, and with a bit more choice. The girl at the front desk was very nice, but she kept trying to give us a map. We told her we lived here and just wanted to try something we may not have heard of. She then Directed us to the concierge. Not so much fun to get passed around from person to person, but they were always nice about it. The gentleman who was working at the door was also the concierge he suggested us to go to Vertige which was a very nice French restaurant in the Plateau of the city. Nothing new food wise for us but good either way. When we finally got to bed we noticed a bit of noise from outside we were facing Sherbrook street). There was a little bit of noise, but that is to be expected when staying in the city. The next morning we passed by to inquire about the taxes on our bill. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know there was a hospitality taxe on top of all the other taxes in quebec. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant on the way out. My girlfriend and I go out for breakfast quite often, it was nice to have a buffet breakfast for only 15$ comes with eggs, sausage, fruit, coffee, and a bunch of other stufff we didnt want. Compaired to most breakfast the price was compairable and seeing any other a la carte breakfast would cost the same price for the same or even less, it was worth it we figured.

Upon check-in, despite requesting high floor was placed on lower floor. Spouse realized this and I immediately asked for higher floor, but the desk clerk *rolls eyes*, and says the only higher one, two floors up actually has a worse view. I speak French, but thought perhaps his attitude was because I addressed him in English. Ok, I thought, so we went with it. The room overlooks a busy street, but noise wasn't that bad. Oh well, we didn't have the highest room rate, I justify to myself. Indoor garage parking is about $25 per day after taxes/fees, which was reasonable and very secure. No complaints there. Free wifi was slow but a nice perk. Restaurant in lobby was very pricey for middle of the road quality food; we ended up eating one meal there but went back for two at the Sofitel (they have a truly outstanding menu.) Rooms are adequate -- look at the pics here and you will get a good idea of what to expect. Dingy old dirty carpet that I wouldn't walk barefoot, but otherwise pretty clean and well maintained. Towels aging and thin, but comforter laundered (big plus) and sheets very clean. No robes or other amenities of significance. I would have given this a significantly better review except for my experience at check out at the end of our 4 day stay. A short time prior to our checkout time, my spouse became quite ill, and around 11 AM she calls the desk and asks for a few more minutes to checkout (I'm a Hilton honors member.) Check out is normally at noon. A different desk clerk again gives her attitude, and says \"That is not a feature of Hilton honors... it is our discretion, and you can only have until 12:30.\" I had all the bags packed, standing by the door in a suit and tie, waiting for my spouse to exit the bathroom, and at 12:25 there is a knock on the door by a woman with a clipboard, asking \"what time are you going to leave? Your time is up and need to be out.\" I pleaded with her that my wife was a tad ill, and she said \"Fine\" and left. ??? We were out of the room less than 10 minutes later, at 12:35. I've never really been treated like this as a frequent business traveler -- I'm not sure if it was because I made the reservation on Expedia? Or if they get a lot of \"squatters?\" I checked availability of the hotel and it was wide open, so they were not pressed for turnover. The woman was not a room-cleaner, she was just bouncing us out. Two weeks later, and the hotel has still not credited my Hilton Honors account despite writing it on Expedia reservation form and giving it to the desk clerk. If you stay here - go in with the mindset of a Holiday Inn, not a real Hilton or even Doubletree. It is adequate, but poor, surly service by staff with a poor attitude ruins the stay. We're obviously two professionals after a four day stay and left the room immaculately clean, but they can't give an extra 30 minutes? For shame.

Sure, it's a big hotel, but the front desk service was excellent at check-in and although the room was a little anonymous, it was spacious, had a really comfy bed, decent shower, and even a bit of a view.

After a brief discussion at checkout, the front desk staff (who were, again, very helpful and polite) admitted the mistake and resolved the problem - yet on arriving home we discovered the credit card had been charged the full amount shown on the incorrect bill, and then refunded. We were surprised the card was charged before we'd ok'd the charges at checkout, and the refund left us out of pocket due to the exchange rate difference. In fairness, we emailed Hilton to complain once we got home and noticed the problem - they've promised to make up the difference - but they should not have charged our credit card before we had ok'd the bill in the first place.

Location is great, short walk to Rue St. Laurant which has good shopping and nightlife. Also close to a bunch of metro stops and Old Montreal. The room was very very clean. The bed had a knob to adjust firmness. The hair dryer in the bathroom had a nozzle which I love because my hair can be particularly unruly. The front desk staff was very helpful in making reservations for us (btw - Mastro S.V.P. has great seafood!) and for giving us recommendations (Scwartz's for lunch - delicious). Breakfast is not included and was $14.95. We opted to eat outside and get a bit more atmosphere than the hotel lobby. The gym and pool are fabulous. The view is amazing and indoor pools are always awesome. But there were no towels anywhere! I've read that in other reviews but did see some people with towels but have no idea where they got them. We asked the attendant who was cleaning the pool where to get them and he said we had to bring one from the room. It didn't make sense to me as the ones in the room are not pool towels.

Hilton has three offering DT Montreal: -The Hilton Bonaventure, which is conveniently located next to the train station. This is the oldest property but has recently been renovated. It tends to be the most expensive as it is a \"full service\" hotel (higher end restaaurant, rooftop pool, executive lounge...) As such it caters more to the business traveller -The Embassy Suites is located next to the Congress Centers and steps away from Old Montreal. It is relatively new and its \"suites\" makes it a good option for larger families and tourists seeking a mix of good value with above average room amenities (many rooms feature fireplace, jet tub and a kitchen with appliances). -The Garden Inn, located close to McGill University and the downtown shopping district (Ste.Catherine street - Eaon Centre, The Bay,...) It offers great value (it is often the least expensive of the three) and features contemporary \"standard\" rooms with relatively standard room amenities (the microwave may be the only non-standard item) A little bit more about the Garden Inn as this is a review about this hotel!!! Hotel Location: Very convenient for friends/family of McGill Student. Metro station (underground) a couple of blocks away. A decent spot for business as well as it is close to some of the business skyscrapers (Sherbrooke Street). If driving and coming from the southern part of Downtown (Ville-Marie Expressway, South Shore...) this means that you will have to go \"through\" downtown which maybe a little annoying during rush hour. If arriving by train, it is a short taxi ride and it is walkable (surface or in part through the underground path). Subway/Metro is not really an option as the Train station (Bonaventure, Orange Line 2) and the Hotel (McGill, Green Line 1) are on separate line and would require backtracking. Reception / Check-in Open space, modern and contemporary. Very friendly, bilingual (English and French) staff. Efficient. As this was my first time at this location, was offered a review of all amenities services Rooms If you have been into of of the \"newest\" Hilton Garden Inn, the room will look very familiar. From a design perspective, it is very consistent with the \"corporate\" look of this brand. It is modern/contemporary, yet relatively basic. The bed is adjustable (for comfort/firmness) and you have yous standard choice of pillows (feather/foam/hypoallergenic). Room also has a work desk, TV, microwave... The bathroom is of good size and feature and \"stand-up\" shower only (no bathtub). Bathroom amenities feature the standard amenities for this chain: Neutrogena products. As I was on the top floor, facing Sherbrooke Street, I had a farily unobtructed view of Mount Royal, and a direct view of the illuminated cross at night. Only one negative about the particular room that I was in. It was getting very noisy at times - I realized that the room was located right above the hot tub located in the exercise area. Free high speed internet included Restaurants Unfortunately, I cannot comment on food quality as my schedule did not allow me to grab a meal there. However, the offering appears to fit with the hotel - ie: young, modern, contemporary. Montreal has a lot to offer food-wise and there are several restaurants withing walking distance that will acoomodate almost any budgets Exercise/Pool Located on the top floor, this may be one of the best feature of the hotel. Many of the newer Garden Inns do relatively well in this area (as far as quality of equipment) but they use very small rooms to put everything. The exercise and pool area is very large and offers \"panoramic\" views of Montreal. There are several treadmills, bikes and ellipticals to choose from. Unfortunately, the equipment does not feature individual TVs, which I find a nice distraction while exercising. When you get out of the exercise room, be careful as some of the doors lead to an appartment/condo complex attached to the hotel Other: For security reason, one has to use room key in elevators.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa-Gatineau", "Title": "\u201cEaster Weekend in Montreal\u201d", "Author": "Lappy01", "ReviewID": "UR60339155", "Content": "Drove from Ottawa to Montreal.

After a lot of research online (love Trip Advisor!) we chose the Hilton Garden Inn. Being the Hilton name and not a cheap room, we expected a lot. First, the room itself was lovely, modern and very very clean. The staff were helpful (with one exception) and friendly. Location was also good as we love to explore the city on foot and using the Metro and got every where we wanted that way, including walking to the Old City. But being a Hilton and the cost we expect a polished experience. First, until I read a review submitted recently after we got back, I had no idea that you had a room choice of bath or shower (note the or, not an and). This needs to be far clearer online and elsewhere. We had a shower and although it was okay you had a choice, either good water pressure OR warmer water as the warmer you turned the tap the less pressure you received... Secondly, we are not much into nightlife and after along day of walking around we like to enjoy our evening in our comfortable suite (which we pay the extra to have for just that reason) and maybe watch a movie. Unfortunately the website is once again misleading and the channel selection is not what was expected, and we were very disappointed. This is also where the helpfulness did not shine as a call to reception about this (in case we just needed to do something different to get access) the day we arrived led to a promise that we would hear from the general manager as this was not what the website said was available. Well, we are now back home and still no call :-) And, finally, this one is just an example of how someone needs to pay attention to the details. The little pamphlet that you get your room access cards in clearly states that if you opt out of the daily paper, you can drop your room fee accordingly (by 75 cents, who cares) BUT yet the paper is not actually delivered to your door like a lot of hotels do. I don't get this one at all as we can't be alone in experiencing at the door delivery at other hotels. Come on Hilton. We didn't bring a car so have no comment on parking at the hotel etc. All in all we would recommend the hotel if the details don't concern you but as this is the second Hilton hotel family stay in Montreal that was lacking in the details, we will take a long look before we book at either of the Hilton's we have visited in Montreal in the future.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cThe best place in Montreal\u201d", "Author": "Alex991", "ReviewID": "UR44532458", "Content": "We stayed here over the weekend, this Hilton was recommended by some friends.

Understandably, during a UFC weekend in Montreal the prices were inflated but the price of this Hilton was surprisingly competetive compared to other hotels in the area but on a non-event weekend even in the summer it's cheap at $120/night. The location is excellent walking distance to both St. Laurent and St. Catherine's so for nightlife and eating purposes it's great. The service was amazing. I made the mistake of booking a 1king bd instead of the 2-queen I intended. This is one of the few that actually has 2 queens in the room by the way. After realizing the mishap, we went back to the front desk and they were able to find a room to accommodate us with no extra charge. Room was simple but really clean with great comfy sheets and an amazingly comfortable bed. Us girls had a great sleep. I work for public health in Toronto so I'm very cautious about hotels and its cleanliness. This location was very well kept. Security was amazing as well as you need to swipe your room card in order to access the elevators, the parking garage and pretty much virtually every part of the hotel. The staff really make everything easy for their patrons.

Was supposed to stay in a suite on the 11th floor (according to my Hilton Honors preferences), but at check-in was told there was a construction elevator outside my window. I was given the option of looking at the room first, and indeed, the elevator was literally on the other side of the room window. I was not comfortable with this, and within 10 minutes, another room was found. Although the new room was not a suite, it was plenty big enough for my needs, with a great working area - comfy desk chair and plenty of light. Also, the bathroom was huge, with a big shower stall. The fitness centre had new equipment. I took a quick look at the pool, which also seemed nice. This is a more basic version of the Hilton brand, meaning no room service in the morning. The buffet breakfast was OK - not the best I've had, but it served the purpose. As I was there for work, I can't really comment on the neighbourhood, though it did seem a bit far east of the core, and hence may not be the best for shopping, etc. Also not sure of proximity to Metro stations.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hilton Garden Inn\u201d", "Author": "Fraulein1020", "ReviewID": "UR22230985", "Content": "Loved the Hilton Garden Inn.

Old Montreal is close by metro or cab ride. Rooms are decent size, bright, clean, new, and the beds are really comfortable. Daily housekeeping was efficient and did a great job. Microwaves, fridges and coffee makers in each room were a nice touch. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food and the restaurant is good and room service very reasonable.

Only one comment to add that may not be too flattering. I felt blindsided by the fact that I got a bill the next morning for $23 for parking in the garage.

The rooms are well appointed, good sized, if not huge and include a safe, coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. Everything works since it is all new. TV is hooked up to the local cable system, so lots of channels (both English and French) are available. However, pay to view movies are not available, but you aren't going to Montreal to watch movies, are you? There is a great fitness room and indoor pool and sauna. In addtion to having a good quantity and quality of workout equipment, the fitness room and pool are on the 11th floor and have large windows, making for an attractive space. The business center has two computers, which is adequate and internet access is at no extra charge. The staff is very helpful and efficient and clearly eager to make a good impression and all were fluent in English ( I assume they are fluent in French also and I heard one speaking German, but since I don't know those languages, I can't comment on the fluency of the staff in them). As usual at most Hilton Garden Inns, there is a not a full service restaurant, but room service is offered and there is a small bar. A full breakfast buffett is offered, including made to order omlettes. This was quite good. The location is in a pleasant residential area near McGill University, so there are plenty of restaurants, bars, stores and services nearby. The Place-Des-Arts Metro station is two blocks away. It is not in Old Montreal nor in the heart of the business district, but it is easy to get to both by Metro, taxi or on foot. The only real disadvantage of the location is that it is not connected to the underground walkway system. There are several other hotels nearby including a Courtyard, Holiday Inn, Detla and Four Points, but it is unlikely that any are superior to this property.", "Date": "October 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cLove, Love This Place\u201d", "Author": "Rozpause", "ReviewID": "UR19283166", "Content": "The hotel opened on Wednesday.
