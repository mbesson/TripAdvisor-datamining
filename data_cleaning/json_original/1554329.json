The 24-hour market inside the hotel with snacks and toiletries has a decent supply. I got in late and was able to find a frozen vegetarian dinner.

A couple of points to note: The airport shuttle arrangement was confusing as there are many many Hilton hotels in Toronto and the website gives no indication of where to go (Bay S5), the signage at the airport was unhelpful and the airport courtesy phone didn't list this hotels contact details.

Gee, I hope someone at Hilton reads these! Our room was clean as could be, and felt so fresh. As usual, the Hampton Inn bed was very comfortable, and our stay was quiet and restful. Breakfast was standard Hampton Inn fare, which after 2 weeks on the road is predictable, but certainly adequate and with enough variety to satisfy for a quick and easy meal to get the day going. We would absolutely stay here again when we visit Toronto!", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Caernarfon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious And Cozy Nights Sleeps\u201d", "Author": "EricaJ3", "ReviewID": "UR84122865", "Content": "This hotel was really nice and warm.

It appears to be brand new, & was real handy for us for getting onto the 401. We were driving in from the US, so came in off the 403 & was only a couple of minutes down the road. The reception we received was excellent, & the room was great! I've had experiences with some reward programs where they put you far far down the halls in budget type rooms, but we were right around the corner from the elevator as is my preference, & even had a personalized letter awaiting us in the room along with a bottle of water & package of cookies. Room had 2 queen size beds, a microwave & bar size fridge which was handy for us as we were on a road trip & were able to rechill our water bottles & soft drinks for repacking in to our cooler bag the next morning. The breakfast room is quite spacious, & well appointed (unlike most breakfast rooms I've experienced), you wouldn't even mind hanging out there in the evening if there was a group of you. The breakfast was very good, small omelettes & great little sausage links the morning we were there, + a large fruit bowl of melon, pineapple, etc., (a noticable upgrade from the Holiday Inn Express breakfasts we'd had the previous 2 mornings in another city). I really liked their robust coffee as well. The room was very cold when we entered, (67 degrees) but with the handy electronic wall thermostat, I just set it to 72 & bingo, we were comfortable in minutes. Bathroom was large, marble type floors & walls, plenty of towels available in a nice presentation. The TV was bigger then what you normally see in a breakfast included type room, (at least a 40\").
