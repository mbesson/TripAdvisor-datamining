The hotel is located 5 minutes stroll from Orchard Road and the metro station and so is withing easy reach of all locations. Our room was very cramped due to the extra bed for our daughter - not really a room to be used for any more than a double or twin. furnishings were good and the bathroom was average. we did request a pool view and received one but from what i could see, non of the first floor rooms had balconies which was such a shame as it would have been lovely to enjoy the view we had. We opted for a 'deal' on arrival which was sold as a one price for breakfast, internet and a couple of extras - just be aware that when you actually come to pay for this 'one price' offer, they will add tax onto it which bumps the price up when staying a few days! Breakfast was buffet style and was again average for both quality of food and choice. Staff were nice and most of the time helpful and friendly.

I stayed in the service apartment for 7 nights with my young son, and it was a mixed experience but generally positive. First the apartments are located at the back of the hotel, a seperate building which you have to walk across a road and through two parking lots, no sidewalks, to reach. At check-in there was a mistake in my booking which required a call from our travel agent to resolve. Once at the apartments, there are two elevators which service the six floors. The elevators ran smoothly and we never had to wait long. The building itself is pretty dated but well kept. The apartment was a split level with the bedroom on the top by the front door, and the living/dining, bathroom and kitchen on the bottom. The apartment had a generally damp feeling so things never quite dried when I hung clothes up. The couch was incredibly uncomfortable but there was a nice reading chair with ottaman. The couch could to convert into a double bed, but the mattress looked very thin and cheap. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking pots, cutlery/dishes, and glasses. The fridge and stove were small but adequet, and there was plenty of shelf space. Bring your own salt/pepper. No brew coffee machine was available; but a hot water maker and instant coffee. The bathroom was clean and well kept. It is recently renovated. There was also a patio which opened from the living room, with a dining table and two chairs. The lock to the door is low so a small child could reach it. The patio railing is a half wall with a built in sitting bench next to the edge; those with little children would want to be careful about this. The bedroom has glass looking out to the living room so you couldn't really have one person sleeping and the other in the living room watching tv. There is no door to the bedroom. There was a closet under the stair case which was great for storing our luggage. Room service was very good; timely, good food, hot. The pricing is middle expensive, relative to other Singapore hotels. Hotel food is generally very expensive in Singapore ($25-45 SD per dish). Complimentary bottled water was replaced daily. Housekeeping was very good (did the dishes!) There is an Isten grocery store at the Ion shopping center (5 mins walk) but it is geared to Asian food products. Find a Cold Store grocery to find more European/American food (Mac&Cheese for example). There is a Pizza Hut in Lucky Plaza which is about 5 mins walk. To get from the apartment to Scotts road, you have to walk down a road (no sidewalk) and a parking lot. All the parking lot walking really reduced the whole experience. It feels like the step-child of the hotel. Internet access is $28 per day *per device*. Additional devices are $28/day each device. All told, I'd stay again but if I found other serviced apartments, I'd try them rather than staying at the Good Wood again.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cElegant, warm hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "globetrotter6", "ReviewID": "UR125727305", "Content": "This hotel is situated in the midst of a lovely garden yet in the heart of Singapore.

Raffles, of course, is the best-known of the latter, and there's no denying its talent in evoking olde-worlde charm. But it gets a decent run for its money from the Goodwood Park. The GP is about 500 meters from the splendid Orchard Rd (surely high among the world's most attractive shopping strips), and sits a block back, haunched on a hilltop corner with a slightly haughty demeanor. Inside, it's lovely - cool, restored (or should that be maintained?), two excellent swimming pools (one centred terrifyingly in the rear courtyard where almost every room can watch you strip off and swim) and one blessedly more discrete off one of the wings. All mod cons are there - wifi is fast, service is good, food OK, prices on booze etc horrific (welcome to Singapore) conference facilities, some nice poolside spaces for cocktails and events. The balcony rooms are best, but most rooms are spacious, air-conditioned beautifully against the sticky Singaporean climate. Just be sure to specify that you don't want a twin room - unless of course you do want a twin room, in which case you're very likely to be in luck. I did hear a couple of growling businessmen complain that it's too far from the CBD area, and it's true, it is a fair hike by taxi.

The glorious white colonial-style building conjured up images of a luxurious, glamourous and classy interior, without being overly modernistic So, when we planned a trip to Singapore, and found a really great deal, we were elated. Imagine my surprise when the taxi pulled into the driveway. The main entrance wasn't located in the main iconic building but behind it. The reception area, while still considered smart by most standards, was more like the reception area you would expect from a business hotel. There are 2 pools, the main one near the main reception area, and another smaller one servicing the Parklane wing (which houses the apartments). The swimming pools were quite basic with not much ambience. Our room was located in the Tower block as per my request. The room and bathroom were quite sizeable. Room was meticulous cleaned and tidied daily, so kudos for that. But being an old hotel, it still does not feature a separate shower stall. One had to climb inside and stand in the tub to shower and the shower was leaking and water would leak onto the floor when we showered. Location-wise, it's great as it's right in the heart of the city. One can walk to the amazing shopping strip, Orchard Road in a few minutes. But being located on a slight promontory, the 2-3 times daily that we had to walk up and down the little \"hill\" soon got a little tiring. I guess if I sound harsh on this review, it may be because I had such high expectations. It was, at the end of a day, still a very good hotel but I guess I was a victim of my own expectations.

Good. But 5*?\u201d", "Author": "NeilandAnn", "ReviewID": "UR122860878", "Content": "Q. What is a 5* hotel? The Goodwood Park claims to be 5* but so too do the nearby Marriott, & the Hyatt and down at the Harbour area: the Mandarin Oriental and the Raffles Hotel - amongst others. Singapore is positively awash with 5* hotels. The GP's facade is impressive enough, but, sadly, guests are driven passed the wide and imposing staircase and deposited at the far side of the building, at the less impressive 'tradesman's entrance' (that description \u00a0is very unfair - but I am reporting on a 5* hotel!).\u00a0 If 5* stands for luxury, then I am afraid the foyer and reception area of the hotel just don't cut the mustard. Yes, it's functional and clean and tidy - but 5*? compared with the other hotels mentioned? Sadly not. OK, \u00a0in the hotel: \u00a0what about the facilities? There are no designer boutiques, & there is only one bar. But there is a restaurant, and a coffee bar (once breakfast has finished) and a delightful cake shop. There are also two swimming pools and a well equipped (if quite small) gym. Or does 5* stand for the quality / size of the bedroom? In this case, the GP fares well. Our room was spacious, fully equipped with large flat screen TV etc and a very comfortable king size \u00a0bed. The in-room Wi-Fi (a must for me; away from my business) was just perfect - fast & free! But the bathroom, I'm afraid, wasn't large- it wasn't too small - it was adequate; but, again, I am reviewing a 5* hotel.\u00a0 We didn't need much service as we were only there 2 nights, but what service we did need was speedy and friendly and well-informed. Just as you would hope and expect. In conclusion, the Goodwood park is not the most luxurious hotel in Singapore. For 'luxury' it is down the pecking order. But, its' position is good (a few minutes walk from Orchard Road and the MTR), it is of a very good general standard and, in particular, the main bedroom is excellent. As we'd booked the hotel along with our flights it's difficult to give an actual price comparison between the GP and the other 5* hotels mentioned, but I would be absolutely flabbergasted if it didn't compare very well and wasn't, in fact, far better value.\u00a0 How much will you pay to walk across large marble floored receptions? or to visit in-house designer boutiques? at the end of the day, that is what it probably boils down to. \u00a0If your preference is a grandiose, dramatic reception area flanked by shops selling Rolex and Hermes than the GP is probably not for you. If, however, you'd like a spotlessly clean, efficient, \u00a0well-run hotel with all normal facilities and with a very good bedroom area that is more-than-likely far better value for money then the GP will not disappoint. So, I am not sure when I will be back in Singapore again, but I hope to be one day - and I will be certainly checking if they have a room for me at the Goodwood Park hotel.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cTired,,,and shabby\u201d", "Author": "seasiasj", "ReviewID": "UR122678520", "Content": "Stayed in 'Parklane' suites...overpriced and shabby.

When she went to view the rooms last month, she already informed Catering Sales that it was for her birthday party. They then advised her that she could hold a party there as long as everyone left my 12mn. However, we were chased out of the room by three managers just before 9:30pm. After much negotiation, they allowed everyone to sing her a birthday song before leaving the room. While everyone was singing her the song, the poor girl was in tears and very much affected. Firstly, why is there such poor communication between the security and catering sales department? Granted that other hotel guests need to rest, we were definitely not making a lot of noise. The room was so low profile that some people even had difficultly spotting the room upon reaching the floor. Besides, most of us were from the hospitality industry and so we were even more sure to maintain low noise levels. Secondly, why is it that there are two other parties on the same floor but no one was chased out in the other rooms? It was noted that the guests in the the other rooms seem to look more mature than most of us. Thirdly, what kind of service is this from a '5-star' hotel? Another friend of ours celebrated her birthday in the same hotel, same room type earlier this earlier this year but no one got chased out. I wish to point out to readers here that this hotel seems to give us the impression that they are practicing double standards. If they can do it to locals, what more tourists? Besides, who would want to stay in a hotel that does not care about a guest's situation? Even if the birthday girl was in the wrong, there no attempt to do a service recovery or empathize with her situation. Is this hotel void of empathy? Besides, why did Catering Sales close the deal with her if the hotel does not like its guests to hold parties in the room? To the staff of the hotel: Was your 21st BIrthday spent crying as well? Please give us an explanation, even though it seems the the hotel does not even reply to, or keep track of their feedback form this website.

Not sure I would stay here again as I found the food prices to be outrageous. We did not pay for the breakfast in the price of our room,knowing that Orchard Road was only a few steps away with many, many choices for the palate. I was, however, a bit disappointed after checking in and finding that a cup of coffee was $10. The Continental Breakfast was $26. I feel the prices were a bit high, even though it is Singapore! The room itself was okay, not great. I realize the hotel was built in 1900 so bearing that in mind it is in good shape. From the outside it is very impressive. I had booked our hotel online and I'm not sure if that was why we had the room we did but we had to pass through the business centre area to get to our room. After coming from the pool or workout room it was a bit uncomfortable walking through this area when there were lots of people milling about in the foyer area. There were only 2 plugs in the room and the one in the bathroom would accommodate a razor only. It stopped working at one point but then seemed to come back within a few hours. The plug for the hair dryer was very loose and as a result I had to have my husband hold the plug in the wall while I used it. There was no other way to do it. There were other power issues as well....sometimes the lights would all come on and then off and repeat. Only during the daytime however so not too big of a deal. I found the carpeting in certain areas of the room to be very discolored (particularly dark looking in the corners where it met the wall) and we had an open pot light in the ceiling missing a cover so it glowed at night. The other issue I had was trying to use the internet through the hotel. No one seemed to know if I should be allowed to use it and how much to charge me. In the end they decided to charge me $15 for 30 minutes use and I now see that the hotel advertises Wifi for $30 for 24 hours. Seems a bit disparate to me! On the plus side the staff were outstanding and worked to a very high standard indeed. Everyone was always professional and smiling. Something unique was when you asked for a wake up call you would receive the automated call at the appointed time and then 5 minutes later receive a personal follow up call where they wished you to have a great day. A living snooze button...that was wonderful. The pool was very nice, actually 2 pools to be exact. Hardly anyone used them so it certainly was nice and quiet.

Our room (by the quieter and more charming of the two hotel pools, the one in the Mayfair courtyard) was fresher and looked as it had been done up recently, muted greys, a stone wall and spacious enough. The bed had a firm mattress with a softer layer on top, and real down pillows which mould themselves around your head. Louvered window blinds looking onto the greenery around the pool, very pretty. Peaceful, too. The room had all the bits and bobs you'd expect, although the bottle of shampoo was strangely minimal, suitable for one person, although no doubt they would have brought another if we'd asked. The service was a bonus - all the staff said a cheery hello whenever they met a guest in the corridor. Dinner in the grill room was uniformly excellent, around $100 each without getting carried away, with reassuring food cooked well rather than anything show-off. Buffet breakfast didn't have the range of many other bigger places, but everything was just right - pain au chocolat light and crisp, ommelette firm on the outside and creamy in the middle, bacon crispy (and real, not the ersatz turkey bacon that is so commonplace these days), and coffee the standard benign and slightly bland hotel brew that doesn't offend but doesn't necessarily delight either. Overall the Goodwood has a pleasingly faded old colonial style without being crusty and pompous, and was a good balance between a big impersonal \"business\" hotel in terms of amenities, and a small, friendly hotel in terms of the service.

An enormous reservoir with various shaded walks amongst the monkeys and other wildlife. We chose that over the commercialised Sentosa Island for a day out.

With a conservatory. The hotel is really close to Orchard Road , main street for shopping , Tangs\u2019 store is a must , and at Christmas\u2019 the retailers go out of their way to gift wrap everything no matter how small ,and the Christmas lights and decorations are so magically . Hotel is very close to the MRT , and only a few stops away from , Singapore eye , Raffles , Clark quay ( great for restaurants).

That night, I ordered room service and stayed in to watch the Royal Wedding. When they brought my meal, it was completely overcooked and inedible. I called and had them make Fish and Chips for me instead. They did, and these were just okay. I had a horrible night's sleep because the bed was incredibly uncomfortable.

The shower is really tiny with a shower curtain that flowed in against my body pushing me up against the wall.

The ambient in hotel lobby is relaxing, more suited for leisure travel than business travel. Reception was friendly and efficient. I booked the deluxe tower room but on arrival I was upgraded to the deluxe suite. The deluxe suite was clean and comfortable. The general area of the suite were spacious though I wished for more space to maneuver my bags onto the chest. It was hampared by the ceiling-high column beside the bed and the dressing table chair. The suite was pretty quiet at night. Occassional the sound of room doors being closed can be heard though that did not detract from a good night's sleep. An unpleasant experience I had at the hotel was the somewhat unfriendly housekeeping staff. I requested for an iron and ironing board to be delivered at 10.30 pm to my room. The staff delivered the items requested in a brusque manner as if I should have the cheek to disturb him at 10.30pm with such request. He handed over the iron and the board, expecting me to carry a heavy ironing board into the suite by myself and left without a word. Despite that, the hotel is a great place to stay in Singapore. Great location and comfy room. And from March to July 2011, they have the durian fiesta where the hotel cafe sells durian cakes and pastries. For the durian lover, this is a must try.

I have many memories of roaming the hallways with a primary school friend while our parents were having dinner, although I hadn't stayed at the hotel except in its loft extension rooms in 1982 when we first arrived in Singapore. Last month I was attending a conference at the Grand Hyatt but on the Monday the hotel was full so I opted to stay just up the street at the Goodwood Park. When I rolled up in my taxi to the lobby, the numerous facelifts had not erased the basic layout of the foyer and I was immediately transported back in time to a personally meaningful period of my life. That reverie was interrupted however on check in, when I was told that internet access would be very complicated that I couldn't disconnect from the connection once made or I'd be charged multiple times (which was not the case). I walked past the main pool, escorted by a very friendly valet, to a back elevator that took me to my room (it overlooked the secondary pool, which some of the past reviewers seem not to have been aware of as it is much more private). The room was fairly attractive in a classical way, with very yellow lighting setting off the vaguely 1990s tropical luxe decor of the room. The bathrooms were small, but hotels of this era all have bathrooms of that size so I was not taken aback. I was surprised that the plumbing rather groaned everytime I used the facilities, which I suppose would be an acceptable level of charm for leisure visitors, but does seem like a minor but fixable issue. The internet was quite straightforward. The room had a nice balcony area which I unfortunately didn't have time to use, but which might again be nice for visitors that planned to take an afternoon siesta. The plusses of the hotel are its food - its local selection at the cafe were myriad, somewhat pricey but excellent value for the quality. I was impressed. I dropped into the Gordon Grill, where I remember celebrating some academic achievement with my now late parents, but was disappointed to find the menu had been expunged of most of its Scottish touches. I'm sure the food is still good but didn't have a chance to try it. The tea time buffet at the lobby lounge appeared very popular when I checked in.

I was given an upgrade to a room overlooking the more secluded of the pools and it had a lovely little private balcony. After a long day of walking around and sightseeing, it was incredibly nice to sit down, organize my thoughts, and relax on the balcony before heading out to a business dinner.

The building is very nice, position is perfect and the staff are all very courteous, however that is where the good service apparently ends. Our Deluxe rooms in the \u2018old part\u2019 were comfortable and spacious, however considering they have been recently modernised, the facilities are very basic. For example there is a large lounge area with comfortable sofas and chairs, but the only TV is in the bedroom. Considering the overall size of the rooms, the bathroom can only be described as cramped and dimly lit. There is only a bath/shower which has a high side and is difficult to get in and out of in the confined space. We also suffered with a lack of hot water in the mornings and at peak times in the evening, something which other guests made similar remarks about whilst at breakfast. Room facilities could be so much improved, if only some though had been put into the design. Throughout the hotel the staff are pleasant and courteous, however the actual level of service offered is very poor. For example the Restaurant staff seem to spend more time looking good and showing guests to the tables than they do actually providing proper service. Whilst having breakfast the used plates etc are simply allowed to pile up on your table and one has to almost trip the waiting staff up to obtain more coffee etc. On several mornings we counted at least 8 \u2018used\u2019 tables left full of dirty plates etc while persons were waiting to be seated. Not good enough when one considers breakfast costs 30 SGD extra per guest !! Breakfast variety offered is pretty average, but the service is well below that which could be expected of a hotel of this class. The same goes for the Housekeeping Staff. Rooms are cleaned daily and there is also a second turndown and re-check in the evening, however standards are pretty low. For example on arrival I noticed the previous guest had kindly left me a pile of toenail clippings under the coffee table, these remained untouched throughout the duration of my stay, I wonder if the next guest enjoyed them too! On the morning of our check-out, my mother returned from breakfast at 8 am to find that the Housekeeping boy was already in her room changing the linen and preparing for a new guest. Instead of being courteous and leaving while she used the bathroom and finished her packing, the boy remained and seemed more anxious to complete his work. This is simply not good enough for a hotel of this class, or in fact any other. Whilst checking out at 9 am, I had to queue due to the lack of staff on the desk. The One person on duty simply could not cope with the demands and paperwork of the three persons requiring service at the same time. Maybe due to the rush the girl was in, we were never asked whether we had enjoyed our stay, or if we would be happy to return. There was also no opportunity to complete any form of Guest Satisfaction Questionnaire either. The Goodwood Park is a beautiful Hotel, but service offered for price paid does not make us wish to ever return.

I booked the Parklane studio suite as I needed a place to fit about 6 friends over for a dinner party (they weren't bunking in) and this was well suited for it. It is actually more for long-term stays like serviced apartments but they do rent out on nightly basis as well. Reception and other staff: Excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Smiles all around. Left a good impression. Complimentary parking coupons given. When our keycards didn't work, the duty manager came over to our building to change the cards for us. Building: The paklane building, which is actually in an annexe of the hotel, separated from the main building, looks rather dated, like an old-style apartment block. But somehow to me, it added a little bit of charm. Parking lots available right in front of the building. Entry is via a private lift with key card access. There is a beauty salon on the ground floor. Room: Split-level duplex. Entrance is on the second floor of the apt. Imm right is the bedroom. Staircase leading down to the living, dining, bathroom, kitchennette and large balcony. Good impressions: It was spacious and fitted all of us in very comfortably. I loved the big balcony where we could hang out and chill with some drinks. It's very quiet and peaceful. You wouldn't know that you were so close to busy Orchard Road. It's good that the bedroom is separated away from the loving/dining areas. I don't like it when the bed is in the middle of everything when you have friends over for a get-together. More privacy. The kitchen, albeit compact, was very well-equipped. It had pots and pans galore, all necessary cooking utensils, crockery, cutlery, diningware, glassware enough for about 4 people. There was a medium-sized fridge, microwave, toaster oven and stove. As my friends managed to cook pasta and such in the kitchen, it was definitely fully functional. Not so good impressions: Strong cigarette smell upon entering the room but it went away after a bit of airing by opening up the big french doors of the balcony. The decor is a bit outdated. It may have been in fashion a while back but it definitely needs some updating now. The bathroom is large, good but boring. The tiles and fittings are getting quite worn out. The TV in the bedroom is a flatscreen but the one in the living/dining is an old CTV from decades ago. Plus, it couldn't swivel so if you sat at the couch, the view is slanted. Luckily the channels are adequate. No free internet. Wireless is available at an exorbitant cost of $30 a day I think. Summary: Did I enjoy the stay? A resounding yes. If you are looking for typical 5-star LUXURY, this is not it. I've definitely seen more glamourous suites. But that's not to say that this place was shabby. Far from that. However, if you want a place like your own private apartment, then this is it. I really felt as though I had friends coming over for a cookout and party at my own bachelor pad but with the added convenience of room service and housekeeping. And the cost at SGD$270 was very reasonable. There are hotels with smaller rooms charging a whole lot more.

Walk past the Marriot turn left and you will see a McDonald's Cafe stand shortly thereafter (about 50yrds down from the Marriot) and the down the stairs walk past McDonald's (main restaurant) and keep going and you will see the food court.

The hotel is beautiful and I loved the ambience. It is considered a top historical hotel in Singapore and in that area it did not disappoint. The room was very clean and was maintained numerous times throughout the day - we never had to wait to have our room prepared for us. The hotel breakfast, which we had included with our package, was very good and had a wide range of options. My son was thrilled that there were pancakes/waffles available. The price of the hotel was very reasonable, especially considering our package that included the buffet breakfast. The best aspect of this hotel for me was the service. I was never disappointed at the Front Desk or with the Concierge. They were always willing to help us and provided great directions and recommendations. We did some non-traditional touring on our trip, wanting to get out of the city and do some hiking, and they always provided great directions and followed up with us when we walked in the door to ask us how our day had been. They were incredibly friendly and helpful! Great staff! There are only two negatives that I would mention about this hotel. The first is the Fitness Room. I think it is a stretch to claim that they have a Fitness Room. The treadmill is truly not functional and cannot be used for running. The eliptical trainer has not been maintained well and does not run smoothly either. The weights are acceptable, but not up to a high standard. I believe that this is something that needs to be upgraded to bring it in alignment with the class of hotel it is rated. If this is an important aspect for you in booking a hotel (which it is for me), I would consider one of the larger chains, such as The Hyatt. Secondly, walking access to the hotel is horrible. We walked as often as we could because the location is tremendous and very close to Orchard Road and public transportation. There is no safe way to walk up to the hotel. You basically have to walk up the road and driveway and there were many times that my son and I had close calls with a car.

There were ample toiletries in the bathroom, which itself was very large. Plenty of tea/coffee in the box next to the kettle, a well stocked mini bar, comfortable robes and slippers. Every afternoon a turn down service was offered, along with clean towels and bottled water. Breakfast was included in our stay, and the buffet was quite delightful every morning. Fresh fruit, cereals, noodles, rice, pastries, cold meats and cheeses, eggs cooked as you like, sausages, crispy bacon, waffles, juices, yogurts etc. The smaller of the two pools was a haven amidst the hustle and bustle, and we made the most of it every afternoon if we could. The MRT was a short walk away, and also the bus stops. The staff were amazing! No one could have been more helpful, friendly, or efficient. Idil Reuben, the Chief Concierge was a delight, as was Julian, a co-worker. They offered plenty of tips on how to get around, what to see, and what to watch out for. Room service was prompt and delightful, who can resist a little spray of orchids? For my niece's 21st birthday, the hotel organized a large bouquet of orchids for her, and also had them treated so she could take them home to Australia with her. Late that evening while in the lobby they also presented her with a birthday cake. The pianist, Eddie, in the lobby was very relaxing to listen to, late at night. He won our hearts by playing Waltzing Matilda, what Aussie doesn't love that sound? All in all, I could not recommend this hotel strongly enough. I can't wait to return there with my family again.

A three story refuge amongst the towering high rise hotels, the Goodwood is elegant with harmonising and peaceful decore, and serviced by efficient staff who are quiet and unobtrusive but readily available. The Oasis Pool was a delight and I spent a whole day there under the shade of the palm trees and had almost exclusive use of it as only two other couples came along for short swims. The room was spacious and immaculate, cleaned each morning and towels refreshed again in the afternoon if required. Breakfast was brilliant as was the service. The small museum of early chinese treasures retrieved from a sunken ship was very interesting and informative. After visiting crowded Orchard Rd once, and deciding that shopping and touring was not for us, we ensconced ourselves in this haven and enjoyed the relaxing surrounds. The only detraction was that we wanted to wash our week's worth of clothes from the cruise: obtain tokens fom reception, find the laundromat located under a separate building at the rear (a bit hard to find) , cost S$5 per load to wash and S$5 per load to dry, one of the dryers is not warm enough so it ended up costing S$30 to do our washing which I felt was rather expensive.

The beds, pillows and linen were top quality. Service was always friendly, attentive and helpful. The location is excellent as the shopping mall strip starts next door and an easy 15 mins walk away turns into the famous Orchard St. Despite being so close, you still get the feeling of quiet and calm; an oasis with none of the hordes traipsing by the front door. Room service is prompt. Buffet breakfast is excellent. Tiffin (afternoon tea) is known amongst the best. Their Coffee Lounge does wonderful dinners. Didn't try their other restaurants. The old building has soul and character, and the new wing blends pretty seamlessly into it. In booking here I had dismissed all those other generic hotels as being same-old, same-old.

If they don't charge to use the televsion why internet. If there is a charge made to the hotel, it should be absorbed in the room charge, or else passed on at cost. This of course applies to most hotels. Ultimately, there is no extra cost for a hotel to charge for wi fi use on an unsecured network because there is no extra cost for the hotel in providing the service.

Sofa in the sitting room (directly above the stairs' landing area) pulls out into a twin size bed (cant even fit two kids comfortably) 6) Pool - didnt go to the other pool but did the main one as it was closer, still hardly any shade (the palm trees are still too young to provide any shade and there is hardly any umbrellas around, only 2 !) and too open (facing the cafe and the outdoor buffet), not a great pool to swim in (not a full size coz one end of the pool had been blocked off for the kids) or even lounging around (very few loungers and not a big pool, the landscaping needs a lot of improvement as well Overall, there is a lot of improvement to be done if they are to keep up the standard of a 5* property in SIN and to charge higher prices like they are doing nowadays.
