We checked in at around 12pm and were greeted by a friendly man who showed us to our apartment. We stayed in a junior suite on floor 6. The apartment consisted of a clean bathroom, good kitchen and a living/sleeping area which was large. Hairdyer, coffee machine and iron/ironing board all included. The view of the TV tower was fantastic. The wireless internet was excellent quality. He said it costs \u20ac5 per night but said he wouldn't charge us. Maybe he says that to all the customers!? Anyway, free internet = good. A metro station is less than a minute walk so it's very well connected. The only negatives would be a lack of air conditioning and it can be quite noisey as a tram passes by the building. Excellent value and worth every penny.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aarhus", "Title": "\u201cThis is a tricky one...

I had been to Berlin before so knew that the apartments were in a prime location for bars and restaurants. They are right on the doorstep as is the Oranienburger Tor U-Bahn (underground.) Also easy access to the S-Bahn (Trains) and Metro (Trams.) On this subject I will have to mention the one drawback we had. We had no trouble with noise from pedestrians as we were on the 6th floor but because the room had no AC we had to leave the windows open (the only open a few inches as a safety precaution) and so had to put up with car and tram noise. We decided to keep the windows shut and sleep on top of the covers. As most of the time we didn't get to bed untill 2 or 3am this wasn't much of a problem (see bars above!) We had room 1 which faced the street but my daughter had room 2 on the other side and had no probs. Both apartments were fantastic with everything laid on except a microwave. We eat out most of the time but the facilities were there anyway. There is a small supermarket 3 doors down and bigger ones in the vacinity. My wife is very fussy with cleanliness and for the first time in years she didn't rewash the pots or wipe down when we first moved in. It was immaculate! Joshua (manager) was very friendly and of great help and will give you a number to contact him. The appartments are also secure with a coded lift that will not move if you press the wrong numbers (see bars above! LOL) The veiw of Oranienburgerstrasse from our room (Room 1) is fantastic with the Television Tower at Alexanderplatz in the background. On your 1st day buy an AB travel ticket from the station for and then you can travel around Berlin freely. Don't forget to validate it (date stamp) in the little machine next to the ticket machine. I would recommend going on the free walking tour with New Berlin Tours. As well as a very informative and fun tour it also gives visitors a good ideas of how this part of Berlin is set out. If you are in to shopping then Friedichstrasse is for you.I would also recommend Berlin Zoo and a walk in the TierGarten on a nice day. Nice park. What more can I say? Just that when we go back to Berlin (and that is certain) then we will be staying here. Get it booked. You won't be disappointed! Trust me......go on ....what are you waiting for?

It was very handy for all sorts of good eating and drinking places, everything was pretty accessible, it was very comfortable, the staff were friendly and left us in peace. The only down side is that Friedrichstrasse is a very noisy street, when the windows were open it was completely deafening. It wouldn't have mattered if it was winter because the apartment has the most amazingly effective double-glazing I've ever seen and cut out almost all the noise when windows closed, but it was quite warm when we were there, and with no air con in the apartment, we faced the choice of being hot or being kept awake with noise. We chose the former and it was okay, but I definitely wouldn't choose this apartment in the height of summer unless an air-conditioner is installed.
