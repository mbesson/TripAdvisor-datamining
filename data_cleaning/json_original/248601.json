So at 10 pm we went out to our car to get an air mattress so our daughter could sleep on that instead of the sofa bed. Thanksfully we were just staying for one night. What bothered us even more was the next morning when we checked out the front desk clerk asked how things were & when I told her about the unusable sofa bed, she said that they were remodeling & had not done this room yet.

But if we used the towels from our room at the pool they would not give us more towels for the shower unless we brought them our used towel. The staff was often rude. Our 19 year old went to use the workout room and was asked her age.

She needed to go get ID to prove her age for the exercise room. The bathroom in the pool area had a plumbing problem and sewage was coming up from the drain. Also the light in the bathroom did not work. Rather than close the bathroom and call a plumber/electrician, they put toilet paper over the drain. The pool was dirty. You could not see the bottom.

The next morning I had a few itchy spots that I originally attributed to mosquito bites. The strange part was that all the bites were head, arm and waist, nothing below the belt line. I had 50 in all and finally called the hotel to let them know that the bites looked more like bed bugs, from photos I picked up on-line. They called back a few days later telling me that Orkin came in and claimed there was no bed bug activity. She sent me the Orkin report and it shows that the Orkin inspector spent 10 minutes in the room. That doesn't sound like enough time to thoroughly inspect a room suspected of having bed bugs.

The fact that it is surrounded by a fence and has a security system (supposedly to control drive in access and egress) I consider a plus, though it does give you the feeling of staying in a bad neighborhood. As far as I could tell, there is nothing bad about the hotel's location. True, it is not within walking distance of anything but a Waffle House, but we chose to stay there for the convenience of the \"park and ride\" service. And hence the reason for the lukewarm review. We arrived on a Sunday for a Monday flight out of Memphis. The shuttle service was on time, courteous and without complication. However, on the return leg of our trip we were informed (on the following Sunday evening) that the shuttle service was not available. We were instructed to take a cab from the airport and the hotel would reimburse the cab driver. As we had been out of country on a week long trip, we were pratically void of any US money, we had some foriegn currency and our wonderful Visa company had suspended out card priviledges, suspicious of all the overseas activity on our card. So we could not have paid the Cab driver ourselves, and upon hearing that he would be paid by the hotel at the hotel, the driver promptly removed our bags from his cab and put them at the curb at theh airport. You see, cab drivers to not like to be paid by third parties in Memphis. Never mind that the cab driver was one of the rudest I had ever met in my life... I'm reviewing the hotel and not the cab company. After a phone conversation between the hotel and the cab company, it was decided that they would take us to the hotel but charge the hotel a $6 \"convenience charge\". I didn't care, I just wanted to get my car and go home. I can only guess that we were the only guests returning to the hotel that night and the $20 cab fare was cheaper than having a shuttle driver on staff plus the vehicle expense. I just wish they would have told us of this in advance, and I would have made it a point to make sure to tuck an extra $30 or so away for cab fare. In one sentence: They broke a promise to us. On the good side, that same Sunday we arrived we incurred a flat tire. I put on the donut spare, but there is no way we could have driven the 150+ miles home on it. A very, very nice young woman behind the desk, upon hearing of our predicament regarding attempting to get a flat tire fixed on a Sunday evening, offered to have her fiance take the flat tire to be repaired and mounted on our vehicle before we returned. We of course made it fiinancially rewarding for her to do so, as this was only fair. But wait... the story gets better! Upon our return, during the same phone conversation where she informed us there was no shuttle service available, she also told us that the tire was not repairable. Her finance had taken it to several shops, and it would seem that we ran over an empty beer bottle near Beale street and it broke and punctured the sidewall. Sucks to be sure, but this young lady and her fiancee took the flat tire to a shop and had the tire replaced AT THEIR EXPENSE, not knowing if we would repay them for the purchase. We did of course, but that showed us some genuine human kindness. These people went out of their way to make sure that our return home was as hassle free as it could be, under the circumstance. So for the hotel: B- for the shuttle experience For the hotel staff: A+ for allowing true Southern hospitality to show through. I would stay there again just for that reason!

The only proteins offered were scrambled eggs that were literally crusty around the edges and sausage patties. In general, I'd grab a cup of coffee and a bagel and that would be it.

Within 7 minutes of waiting in the lobby with our two young children, adjoining rooms magically became available. The bathroom had more hair on the floor than my balding uncle has left on his head! The room appearred to not have been dusted in quite awhile. It has to be glaring and obvious because I'm not much of a duster myself! On a positive note... The pool and hot tub were nice. The motel offers free breakfast. This is a very nice motel. With helpful management and clean rooms it could be a wonderful place to stay.

We did this once before a few years ago and had a very nice experience. But things have changed at this little hotel and we weren't so happy this time around. Our room was fine and seemed pretty clean. Checking in, the front desk person was very efficient and pleasant. But the halls were very noisy and pretty well dominated by children and teenagers who literally ran up and down the hall until quite late at night. Our children were unable to swim in the indoor swimming pool, because it , too, was taken over by a large pack of unsupervised teenagers. We could hear noise from the swimming pool in our room until late at night and then the carpeting in the hallway was soaked for the rest of the night from wet guests walking back and forth to their rooms -- without drying off! The staff seemed not to notice the mess and noise. Our biggest problem was with the airport shuttle. We had phoned ahead to make sure it would be available to take us to the airport at the beginning of the week, and then pick us up to return to the hotel after our return flight a few days later. They assured us that it would be available. Well, flying out, we had no problems. The female shuttle driver was very pleasant and efficient. However, a few days later when we returned, we called the hotel to request a shuttle pickup and were told \"it's busy- for the rest of the night.\" What?? That was the whole point of \"Park and Fly\"! In the end, we had to get our own transportation back to spend the night at the hotel after talking with them by phone several times. The manager was \"out\" and could not help us. Both mornings we ate the continental breakfast. It was basic but good: several cereals,sweetrolls, juice and milk. The little dining area was extremely hot though and was crowded with unsupervised teens and some employees who seemed to be eating their breakfast as well. Overall, this hotel is a basic, adequate place to stay if you just need a bed for the night. But be aware that the shuttle service is \"iffy\" and it you may have to share the common areas with some rather unpleasant fellow travelers. Next time we'll find another place to stay.", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Home of the Ohio State University", "Title": "\u201cToo many issues for me\u201d", "Author": "tntosu", "ReviewID": "UR10449847", "Content": "Allow me to preface this with the fact that this hotel was picked up by my company, so it didn't cost me a plug nickle to stay here. There is nothing to gain by my educating my fellow business travellers about any of this. Additionally, I wrote two notebook pages to include with the comment card, that I had to actually ask for at the front desk, there weren't comment cards in the room or on the front desk readily available for anyone wanting one, that was left at the front desk with the gentleman that was workign at the time, in a sealed envelope with \"Manager\" on the front of it. So this is not the first forum that I have used to express my displeasure. I did not receive, nor did I expect to receive, any communication back from the hotel, but they had my contact info if they wanted to contact me. Check in was the first challenge. When booked, I specified a ground floor room. They had a 3rd floor room for me when I got there and only after being forced to explain my disability in front of everyone within earshot were they miraculously able to find a ground floor room to accomodate me. If your on a business trip and you don't want to work all day and then have to drive around searching for someplace to eat, find a different location to stay at. There's a Waffle chain across the street and beyond that there's nothing. You have to travel a good ways away from the hotel to even find a fast food restaurant. If you want a nice sit down dinner, I'm sure you can get directions from the front desk, but what a pain. I ate at the Waffle chain the 1st night (much better than anticipated) after I fianlly gave up driving around. After that, I ate dinner at 4-5PM over by where I was working, before going back to the hotel. The staff did a good job cleaning my room, but the complimentary coffee pack that I used the 1st night wasn't replaced, they threw my soap from the shower away and didn't replace my bathmat. I made sure the front desk knew not to charge my room for the missing bath mat, because they let you know that you're being charged for any missing items. All very minor issues, but as my title states, too many of them. If you want to use the computer access room, make sure you tell them. I just thought it must cost extra to have access to it, so I just blew it off, but while checking out I overheard another guest complaining about it and the font desk explained to him that you have to come to the front desk to get authorized. I got by without checking my email for three days, but had they shared that info with me when I checked in, it would have made things a little bit more pleasant. Why wouldn't they tell the guests that when they check in? There were as many channels on the TV that had static running through them as there were clear channels. Unfortunately, one of the channels full of static was the guide channel, so I never knew what was coming on. Don't bother telling the front desk, because sometimes the TV's just do that. Good to know, thanks. The apples they have out in the fruit basket looked good, but were like biting into and chewing on styrofoam. As far as the flavor goes, there wasn't any, so avoid the apples. Breakfast looked like it would be pretty good, and what was there was good, but they were out of quite a few items. Only one toaster? I enjoy watching the news while eating my breakfast and I sat at the table directly in front of the TV so I could hear what was going on. For some reason, the young lady that was supervising the breakfast area decided that her paper products needed inventoried during breakfast. Nevermind the fact that they are stored in the large compartment in the bottom of the TV stand that was holding the TV that I happen to be watching. So without so much as an 'excuse me\" or \"this will just take 5 minutes sir\" or \"sir, do you mind if I......\", she went ahead and did whatever she was doing with the paper products, standing directly in between me and my news. Nevermind me, I'm just your guest!Overall, pretty poor continental breakfast experience. Maybe there are a lot of the things I've listed that are individually minor issues, but when you take this many minor issues and cram them into a two night stay, it makes me extremely glad that I wasn't there any longer.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cI will revisit this location again\u201d", "Author": "mccains", "ReviewID": "UR8230410", "Content": "If you only new the half of what I went thought when I arrive at this location not due to the staff but my travel agency is to blame and Erica and Kenneth assisted me with making my stay a very exciting one after the matter was cleared up.

I am an Access USA member and they offered a discounted rate. I was excited by the prospect of saving money during my stay and relying on the 'Holiday Inn' name. Needless to say, the hotel experience was less than savvy. My guest and I checked in just before midnight on Friday the 24th of March. There was a large convention going on so I understood the staff's frustration as I checked in. No directions to the room where I'd be staying. No information about food services available. No thank you or have a pleasant stay. The associate handed me the card keys and moved on to the next individual. The room temperature was 90 degress according to the thermostat. Not wanted to cause difficulty, I adjusted the temperature and decided to go down to the lobby as the room cooled off. The night's sleep was fine, but the next morning had more hurdles. The coffee maker was dirty. I decided NOT to have a cup. The shower was unclean and there was mildew on the inside shower curtain. At this point I was behind schedule and did not have a moment to make the front desk aware. After all, I was receiving a discounted rate, right? Housekeeping came in and did their best, but the room just wasn't comfortable. The wall paper was peeling and the ceiling was cracking and left plaster on the desk next to the bed. There was no privacy sign, nor television directory. I know these sound like small things, but when away from home, one likes to be as comfortable as possible. Had there been a sign to use, I could have kept the housekeeper from entering my room at 9am every morning. After all was said and done, I was ready to leave, making note of the series of 'small' things that needed to be corrected. But, the hotel associate gave me one more for the road. My card, used to guarantee the reservation, had already been charged. Even if I had wanted to adjust my hotel rate (due to the inconveniences), I could not have at this point. I went on to remind the associate that I had been incorrectly billed. I was tax-exempt and gave the associate the information as I checked in. She copied the info and said that 'it was fine.' Apparently these two did not confer. The check out associate simply told me that the person who checked me in was incorrect and that I shouldn't have received the bill under my door because the room had already been paid for. I asked how and the employee went on to say that the room had been charged off already. Good thing I had money available in that account. I had every intention of using another card. The hotel housekeeping tried to make me comfortable by reminding me that they would help in any way possible, but the help that I needed required assistance from the Hotel Manager. I will definitely visit Memphis again, but I will not suggest this Holiday Inn Express location to anyone. The overall condition of the hotel was lacking, even with a full house. Overall, I feel cheated. Next time I'll gladly pay a higher rate to another business that will keep me and my level of comfort in mind. I hope that the things mentioned will be corrected so that no other guest will refrain from staying at this site.", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Express American Way/Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d248601-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Express_American_Way_Airport-Memphis_Tennessee.html", "Price": "$73 - $114*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4225 American Way</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Memphis</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">TN</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">38118</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "248601", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3e/9e/3e9eecf3e7fb1746645fb8f8ab1092c09large.jpg"}}
