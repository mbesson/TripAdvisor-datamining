She welcomed us in both official languages. She inquired about our stay and was ready with information to help us enjoy our visit. We mentioned we had left Montreal 32 years ago and were celebrating an anniversary by playing tourist on this trip. We stayed on the 15th floor. We never waited for the elevator. We had a nice view, but more importantly to us, our room was very clean, neat and very quiet. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. Housekeeping brought water and chocolates in the evening. A nice touch. Gaby and the staff made our stay very memorable by their gestures. We were presently surprised with a food tray after a long day of sightseeing.

My only qualm last stay was that the rooms were in dire need of an upgrade. I stayed on the 24th floor in a recently--I think they said one week before I checked in--renovated room with a king-size bed. The decor, while not extraordinary, was nicely updated in a modern color palette. The king size bed was amazingly comfortable, and the new desk setup with the power strip, cables and ethernet for free wifi was a nice touch. The bathroom was also nicely updated and the shower was great. The room and my floor was quiet and I had no trouble sleeping. I again loved this hotel for the location as you can access the \"underground city\" through the back side of the restaurant and it's a short walk from the Square Victoria Metro stop. The Old Port area is also a short walk. The recent room renovation really helps. The common areas, however, while in good shape and clean, are dated and could use a bit more of an updating to better match the new rooms. Maybe I'm just picky but I like to see some coordination. Finally, there was also some kind of college event going on, and a few of the lower floors were hit pretty hard with a loud, drunk crowd and booming music, but I was so many floors above that it didn't bother me. I just wonder if they considered the comfort of guests who were on lower floors closer to the music, as I could hear it up the elevator shaft for a few floors as I ascended. It was a bit annoying sharing the elevator with drunk kids a few times, but I think it was just one night and there wasn't an incident that really bothered me. I just hope they consider other guests when they allow bookings of this type.

The location is excellent, as it is close to the underground shopping network, and close to Old Montreal. The rooms really need to be renovated. The carpet had a red stain on it (not sure from what), the sink was cracked, the tub was painted and the paint was peeling (the plugs didn't work for either) and we had to put the coffee machine on the floor close to a plug that worked and it took forever to perk. The ceiling was black around the air conditioning vent. We also had to call front desk to have the duvet replaced since there was no stuffing left in it. The \"Dealfind\" voucher was for a premier room (which should be $135.00), but the price of our room was $119.00 which I think was the regular Delta room, we were on the 16th floor (don't know which floor the premier rooms start at). We handed our \"Dealfind\" voucher on check-in and on check-out they charged our credit card full price for the room, and parking (which by the way is pretty expensive $24.00/day) I looked at my bill and noticed this so had to have them adjust it or I would have paid twice.

Internet was free with the room but it was not wireless. It was stable though and I had no problems with the connection. It was a short walk to Ste Catherine. All in, a comfortable and convenient hotel for my stay. Having said that, there were a few shortcomings. The breakfast could be more varied. The choices were basically the same throughout my 9-night stay. Compared to Asian hotels, this hotel came up short in terms of not giving free bottles of water, more toiletries (a disposable shower cap would have been appreciated) and more choices of tea/coffee in the room. Visitors should also bear in mind that the area in which the Delta Centre-Ville is located basically shuts down after 5 pm as it's in the business district. The Delta Montreal is more suitably located in terms of amenities such as shopping and dining. As other reviewers have said, the TV is old and most channels are in French.

Firstly, checking in to this hotel is a nightmare. The staff are rude and slow and they generally only have one person on the desk. The rooms in this hotel are terrible. TV's are so old and they only give you two towels in the bathroom. Breakfast is extremely expensive and it isn't even nice, leaving you feeling totally ripped off. Both myself and my husband were up working late and asked for extra coffee and milk which was brought up to the room straight away. That was fine except that the next morning, the cleaner decided to take everything away from us again. Finally, I had a misplaced key which turns out that my husband found it outside and handed it to reception. We realised what had happened in the space of a few minutes. I went to reception and was met with a passive aggressive woman that asked me for ID to which I responded, it was in my room that we were currently locked out of. Huffing and puffing at my request, she made a call and instructed me to go to my door and security would see me in. My husband then discovered that he had handed my lost key into reception moments earlier to the same staff member. Security came, let me in and confirmed my ID. My husband decided to go down to reception and explain what happened but was gone for a long time so I followed him down. He was still in a line up waiting to be seen. I joined him when we were called and the same woman just looks at us as says \"ID\" to which I explained that I just showed it to security and I certainly wasn't standing in a line for another 20 minutes to show her. At that point I had the other key card in my hand. At this point she threw her pen down, huffed and puffed again and disappeared from the counter. Returning a few minutes later, she issued our second card again. I told her that i didnt like the way she approached the problem and that her attitude was deplorable. At this point she gave me even more attitude so I just turned and walked away. Finally she shouted after me \"have a good day\" in the most sarcastic way she could. I am truly disgusted and this is my first time to ever write a review online regarding a hotel stay but never in my life have I had such a bad experience and I will let everyone know. My advise to this hotel is to keep people like this off your front desk as they are the face of your business and give the first and lasting impression of your establishment.

We thought the price for the hotel was reasonable so we decided to stay here. Aside from the insane amount of teenagers, the hotel was quite nice. The rooms are outdated but comfy and the view is amazing (we were on the 16th floor). Unfortunately, the teenage hormones that be, when we came out of our room, there were potatoe chips, pop cans, and a broken light fixture in our hallway which wasn't cleaned up for about two days. Guess staff were on holidays? It got loud with kids slamming doors and yelling but they must've ran to their own floor or something after. I thought what was great was the security of the building on New Year's Eve. Anyone without a wrist band and cleared with ID was unable to enter the hotel. Loved that! The amount of kids that got turned away was priceless and most likely best for liability reasons. Anyway, no free breakfast, restaurant seemed pricey and hotel parking is a bit of a pain as you have to circle around the building to get in (all one way streets surround the hotel). It's about $20 a day (don't quote me) with in and out privileges which we liked. I LOVED how close the hotel was to EVERYTHING. Dominoes Pizza and pharmacy across the street, Montreal Eaton Centre and tons of shopping about a 5-10 minute walk, clubbing district only a $10 cab ride (with tip) and Old Montreal, about a 10 min walk as well. Their underground PATH system is easy to get to as it connects directly with the hotel so on those really cold days, we just walked underground. Overall, the hotel is NOT a dump.

Clearly they had not followed our request and put us on a party floor, even with our constant complaints to the front desk security did nothing. Our second evening was the same, only the welcomed addition of fire alarms going off! Two days and we got no sleep! Besides the loud and distrubing crowd that was there we had the following: - Very small 18\" CRT televisions in the room, most channels were fuzzy or tinted grey colour. - Panaramic restaurant tried to scam us, we recieved a menu for the buffet outlining the items and cost included. So we booked, once the bill came they decided to increase the price an additional $25.00 per person. Manager claimed we were paying for coat check/parking (as guests of the hotel this was already included), then told us that was service charges and tax (with additional service chargers and tax already at the bottom of the bill).

What you should expect on the negative side, as always, Delta hotels haven't changed their views in the last 15 years so Internet access is 10$ a day for wired and.. they still charge for local calls, which is totally ridiculous these days. Other thing to expect, 23$ a day charge for parking, which is standard for downtown locations but the catch is... this is one of the worst underground parking I have ever seen. I was staying at the hotel with a group and I was the designated driver of a minivan being originally from Montreal. This parking is a total maze, no straight lines, parking in all directions, small parking spots, to many columns and very very small maneuvering place. I drive a minivan at home so I am very used to the size, and even with that I almost hit something about 6 times in three days. Even the below average 6 feet clearance is not entirely exact as I almost hit a ventilation duct with the roof of a Chrysler minivan.... And on top of that, to exit the parking, you have to enter another parking... So my suggestion is that you do not take a car if you go to that hotel and if you do, park somewhere else.

We were greated in a very efficient and friendly manner, and everything was set up for us from the get go. We were upgraded to a very nice suite overlooking the city, and the view at night was amazing. I had contacted the hotel with my plans for the weekend, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that everything I had asked for was already taken care of and reserved for us by hotel administration. I insisted on meeting the operations director Mr. D'Alesio whom with I had emailed earlier in the week to advise him at how surprised I was, and how efficient they were. We had massages booked, manicure booked, restaurant reservation, and even brunch with family and friends. Everything went without a hitch, and hotel and restaurant staff were super accommodating to every request. The cherry on the sundae came when I requested to retain the room a bit longer to accommodate the 15 members of the family coming in for my wifes birthday brunch. They offered to let us stay until 18h00 if we needed which was perfect, and even sent a really nice chocolate arrangement with cookies to her attention without us even asking for it. I could go on. We had supper and brunch in the tour de Ville restaurant, and the food was simply amazing. The selection was really varied and everyone could find something he or she would enjoy. We were walking distance to all the shopping and steps from China town and old Montreal. All this to say the attention to detail was outstanding, all the staff at the reception desk were amazing, and even call you by your name when you contact the reception desk.

The hotel is planning a huge renovation in the Spring of 2012, so the rooms should be more attractive after the reno. A huge plus with this hotel is their location, ideally situated on the Northwest corner of Old Montreal, a block or two from the Bell Centre, near the Metro, shopping, etc. I recommend that if you are driving, you park your vehicle in the underground garage ($23 per 24 hrs) as you can get pretty much anywhere via the Metro or by feet.

His corporate bleating is dull and meaningless as he and his firm continue to rip off unsuspecting customers by charghing maximum rates for a grossly inferior produce. Do take into account that the hotel restaurant must be among the worst I have ever experienced, with a very poor menu and no semblance of fine dining to be seen. In a 28 floor hotel with hundreds if not thousands of bedrooms, the exercise room comprises 3 treadmills and a few cycle machines. A truly dismal little place with none of the facilities which the travelling businessman might reasonably expect from a hotel charging these rates. Each morning around 6 a.m. there was a queue of several disappointed guests who could not use the \"facilities\" because they were so inadequate. Doubtless the general manager will have some reassuring words to offer on finding these scathing remarks - don't believe them. His previous assurances have been meaningless and, rather than delivering a decent experience for his customers, he appears more interested in seeking to project some future aspiration into the psyche of those unwisely considering staying at this vastly over-rated, deeply disappointing example of corporate greed gone mad.

It was not busy that night, there were a few others in our section and everyone noticed the waitress taking a very long time to bring menus and take orders. She was working at the computer kiosk, back to the room for a good amount of time, then over to the front desk, back to the kiosk etc. We waited about twenty-five minutes for menus. The food selection was not that good, with not a lot of options for those looking for something healthy/vegetarian. I ordered Thai spring rolls and it was not like any Thai spring roll I've ever had, the wrap was not a crispy rice but made from flour. Not a lot of protein other than a few snap peas. Not good. And pricey. From what I saw of other people's meals over the weekend, the food was heavy, cafeteria-ish and not very appetizing. The in-room service menu was not much better (Suckling Pig \"a l'orange\" was one option, seriously?) and closed at 11pm so if you have jet lag and need a little something after hours, you're out of luck. Back to that first night, some friends came in as we were trying to find the waitress to pay the bill (no check in for water/drinks from her), and they reported the next day having just as many issues with service and food (one has bad allergies). That waitress pretty much disappeared, leaving a couple of American tourists grabbing pitchers and serving water to the other customers. The rooms were clean and the beds firm and comfortable, but the building is old and the windows don't open leaving you at the mercy of the air conditioning/heating which after a couple of days left me feeling crazy claustrophobic. Rue St. Catherines is pretty close... after a torturous climb uphill. There aren't a lot of food options in the area for several blocks around so it was quite depressing whenever it came time to eat after a long day at the Bonaventure where the food court options are just as bleak.

Tired and desperately in need of some TLC!\u201d", "Author": "UKflightattendant", "ReviewID": "UR116955109", "Content": "The location of the Delta Centre-Ville is very convenient; it offers good access to the commercial areas of Montr\u00c3\u00a9al, along with the University and it is a pleasant, accessible walk to the Old Town and tourist 'hotspots' of the city. The hotel itself, however, is certainly in need of some TLC and is long overdue the planned 'upgrade' that is due to take place this Autumn/Winter (2011-12), particularly with regard to the accommodations. Even though I stayed at the Centre-Ville in the middle of August, and even though the room did indeed feature floor-to-ceiling windows, I couldn't help feeling that the room was very 'dark'. The general colour-scheme is very 'Autumnal' - a palette of browns, beiges, with the odd 'splash' of leaf-green which was undoubtedly intended to lift things a little but is so muted it doesn't quite achieve the desired affect! Furniture in the room is very traditional, well-worn dark mahogany-effect; much of it is chipped and clearly very dated in design, (bedside nightstands, work desk, TV cabinet etc.) There is some interesting (!) wood-panelling going on, which certainly belies the age of it all! There have clearly been some (relatively) recent attempts at refreshing the d\u00c3\u00a9cor - the lamps are quite modern and are very much of the ilk you'd find in a Marriott or Sheraton, and the black-and-white photography on the walls is quite attractive - but these improvements are easily achieved and can only 'cover the cracks' - not literally, I hope/assume! - for so long before major rennovations are required! It has been mentioned before, but the quality of the bedding in the room really is woefully poor. As I say, even though I was in Montreal during sunny, balmy August, I felt quite chilly in bed. After removing the top sheet, I expected to find a blanket underneath, so thin was the bedding - it was actually some kind of duvet/quilt/comforter but there was literally no filling to be found inside - so basically you sleep under four sheets, and that is it. How it would have felt in the middle of a freezing Canadian Winter, I shudder to think! This kind of thing really is unacceptable - it's something that can easily be changed without closing off rooms/floors etc. Things weren't made any easier by the antiquated A/C control unit; the guide to using same in the hotel information book made it sound so easy - however, mine was clearly on its last legs, with a cover taped back on and the labelling of the control options worn off after years of use, making it impossible to adjust room temperature. The bathroom was a decent size, and there was plenty of space round the sink unit for all my toiletries. The shower looked suspiciously old but functioned well. However - and it has been mentioned by other reviewers - the environmental policy asking guests to hang up towels they are happy to reuse is difficult to achieve if there aren't actually any towel racks/rails in the bathroom! My sink/basin featured two large cracks, which had probably been there some time - nomatter how much scrubbing/cleaning goes on, the dirt will accumulate and make them very visible! I cannot comment on the dining facilities of the hotel, since I opted to eat out and bought some snacks in for lunch. Do note that there aren't any fridges or minibars in the rooms, but ice machines are supposedly located on even-numbered floors. Some other reviewers have noted that they couldn't find instructions on how to use the A/C, or locations of the ice machines etc - perfectly understandable, since the 'hotel book' which most establishments display prominently so that guests can familiarise themselves with the services etc. on offer, was hidden away in the work-desk drawer! Overall, I do think this hotel - like so many others of its type - has to a certain extent 'rested on its laurels' and benefited from a constant stream of guests over the years - conference guests, tourists, airline crews, etc. It's a busy place, which means rennovations are hard to achieve, (and let's face it - if you can sell the rooms without making any rennovations, why bother?!), but the upcoming improvements will be most welcome.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quesnel, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNeeds updating...\u201d", "Author": "Richard P", "ReviewID": "UR116901535", "Content": "We stayed three nights in early August.

We found the staff to be extremely efficient, helpful and very friendly. When we arrived there was a large queue at reception as there was a conference being held that weekend and lots of people had arrived at the same time. However there were lots of staff on the desks, waiters circulated with free cold drinks and other members of staff introduced themselves to those of us still queuing, handing out maps of the local area and recommending places to visit - so the check-in time was not nearly as bad as we feared and due to the attentive staff, passed quickly - a very good introduction to the hotel. We had worried that our high school french (or lack of) might be a problem but everyone spoke English - and no-one laughed when we tried out our French! The hotel has a lovely pool and gym and a couple of shops - good for souvenirs or if you have forgotten an essential. The room was very good - clean, elegant and comfortable.

Both Hotels also put a sheet on top on then to disguise how threadbare and ancient they are. Hotel parking is a huge issue. This Hotel has a 700 guest rooms but only 200 parking spaces and the underground parking is like navigating a mine field. Sports teams be aware that your contract will state a flat rate rate for parking ($18 per Diem) with full in/out privileges. However when the hotels insufficient parking is full (and it always is) you're expected to park in the underground of the stock exchange without making mention of the fact that there are NO in/out privileges and the rate is much higher per day. You could easily hit $50 per day in the stock exchange parking lot if you actually want to use your car. I complained and the front desk asked me if I will be using my car for the three days I was there. That was bright.... Finally, don't expect a fridge. God forbid you may want a glass of milk in your room or have some snacks there for the family. Better call room service for that. I'm done with Delta. I don't fell very \"privileged\" with this nonsense going on especially at more than one location.

When I mentioned it to an employee, he suggested that the machine was empty because of the hockey team that was visiting. Time to fix the machines people.

We got a room upgrade as our room wasn't ready when we checked in. Room was spacious, king bed was great. Nice and quiet part of the hotel. We were in room 1915. The so so part of the hotel is that the room could use an update. Curtains, carpet, furnishings all fine but sort of late 80-90s era. I am sensitive to light and although they had black out curtains, they didn't cover the entire window. I rigged it up so that the floor lamp would keep the curtains back and I used a chair on the other side. It was a bit of a pain the first morning but it wasn't a problem after I rigged everything up for the rest of my stay. Wall paper in the bathroom is peeling off and the vent isn't working. All small things that did not wreck my stay but things they could improve on. We did a short workout one morning. Gym is fine, pool is small and the saunas are in the dressing rooms. We never ate at the hotel but we did order room service for breakfast and drinks. Room service was fine. I was expecting to be charged for internet service but they didn't charge us. Perhaps this is part of the upgrade? Parking is $ 25 a day. I liked this hotel a lot but had I paid the full price I am not sure I would have choose this place.

We were also discouraged when our confirmation was listed as a king smoking room. (We were traveling with our daughter and are non-smokers) I called the hotel to request a change to a nonl-smoking room with double beds and got a discouraging response reminding me that there are no guarantees with Priceline. We are frequent visitors to Montreal and prefer to stay closer to Downtown than to Old Montreal so that was another concern. We needn't have worried!! We were greeted warmly. Our non-smoking room with double beds was waiting when we arrived and since we are Delta Privelege members and check-in took longer than 3 minutes, we were offered vouchers for one full breakfast. Priceline was never mentioned at check in and our room location was perfect--away from noisy elevators and ice machines. The walk to Ste. Catherine Street was closer than I thought and we even found free parking immediately around the hotel for all three nights which saved us $22 per night. Even if that had not been the case, both Montreal Delta hotels provide self-park garages with unlimited in and out--a big and unusual convenience in Montreal. Beds were very comfortable and the room was clean and well-kept. The doors could use a little sprucing up but nobody's perfect. Don't hesitate to book a room here. I'm not sure what the breakfast buffet would have cost, but we were very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Coffee and juice arrived as soon as we were seated and the buffet included plenty of meats, eggs, omelets, breads, fruit, and much more. We were on a tight schedule on checl-out day which is when we decided to use our vouchers and were not delayed for a second by slow service.

My detailed comments go as follows: *ROOM: The hotel offers are 3 different room classes: Delta (their cheapest), Premier and Signature Club rooms. All rooms are of the same size but Signature Club and Premier rooms are located on higher floors. Signature Club rooms are the most expensive and include many additional amenities such as a 24h access to the Signature Club Lounge (30th floor), complimentary high-speed internet access, bathrobes, an IPod dock station, cordless phone... My girlfriend and I got a Signature Room. The hotel's official website say all rooms are \"spacious\". I wouldn't say so. 300-350 square foot is not claustrophobic but not spacious. Also, when the most exciting piece of furniture in your room is a tufted armchair (without a footrest), you know that the overall wow-factor is low. Nothing ugly but very generic decor. The view on downtown Montreal was nice, though. I also saw a Delta Room (which was occupied by somebody else in our party). It looked exactly the same as our Signature Room except for dated bedspreads. Bathrooms were quite okay in both rooms. Nothing to mention, except some problems with door locks. For a 4-star hotel, I am surprised that there was no mini-fridge in the room. No safe neither. *CLEANLINESS: No problem here as far as I'm concerned. *SIGNATURE LOUNGE: Nice views, some comfortable couches, no atmosphere whatsoever. Signature Room guests get the complimentary continental breakfast. Bread, bagels, cereals, fruits, some cheese, muffin and pastries. No hot plates (eggs, bacon, sausages). Between 5-7, hors d'oeuvres are served (for free). They are tasty and of good quality overall. Good service from the staff at breakfast time. I have one complaint though. During our whole stay, they kept the lounge temperature so LOW it was impossible to fully enjoy the place. The first thing you noticed upon entering the lounge was how cold it was (I'd say below 18 Celsius). I had to ask three different staff members to fix the problem. The first one ignored my request. The second one said : \"You're cold? I feel ok...\" and walked away (!). The third one seemed to fix the problem but it remained as cold as always. Conclusion: staff members don't seem to have any idea about how to adjust room temperature. They don't seem to care neither. *RESTAURANTS / BARS: There are two restaurants and one bar at the hotel. \"Chez Antoine\" is the lobby restaurant and bar. I haven't tried the restaurant, although I took a look at the menu card and the food selection seemed uninteresting and on the pricey side. The bar section of the restaurant is nothing like your typical 4-star hotel bar (at least not in 2010). Poor lighting, old mismatched chairs and couches, insufficient / overwhelmed staff with poor attitude, slow service and ridiculously overpriced food (would you pay 5.50 $ for two slices of cheese or 14$ for a regular hamburger?). However, you might want to try the revolving rooftop restaurant, le Tour de Ville (30th floor). Yes, it's very expensive, but I've only heard positive comments about it. *POOL / GYM FACILITIES: The pool is clean but very small. No hot tub. Changing rooms are awful. I'm pretty sure nothing in there has ever been changed or refreshed since the disco era. Shower partitions are rusty at the bottom and the tiles have seen better days. Walls are covered with pale green tiles that make the place look like an old operating room. Not 4-starish. Like all the rest, the sauna is old but was in good working order during my stay. The fitness room is well equipped and clean. *STAFF: Front-desk and lounge staff were quite nice and helpful overall. *PARKING: Didn't use it so I can't say anything about it. *LOCATION: At walk distance to many hot spots (Central Station, Bell Center, Place Bonaventure, Ste-Catherine St. ...). The hotel is directly linked to the Square-Victoria subway station, which is a plus. *CHECK-IN / CHECK-OUT: I'm not the one who checked in but check-out was very smooth. One interesting feature of this hotel chain is that Delta Privilege members (you can enroll for free) can get early check-in as early as 8 am (instead of 3-4 pm) and late check-out as late as 6 pm (instead of noon). We got the 6 pm check-out and it makes a world of difference! I think that feature is really worth mentioning, and I'm not sure whether all hotel chains provide such convenient perks to ALL of their members (I'm no \"Diamond-Platinum-Gold-Super-Elite\" member at all). *GENERAL COMMENTS: This hotel looks nice and has a rather unique late-70s architecture. It's generally comfortable and always clean. There are some problems but they won't ruin your stay unless you expect a cutting-edge 4-star hotel. I'd rate it 3.5 stars. Regular prices for standard rooms (no promo code, no Hotwire/Priceline) are generally kept between 110 and 200 $ depending on the season, which is honest.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot a good value!\u201d", "Author": "JP58964", "ReviewID": "UR82044371", "Content": "Small room, no mini bar and no service after 11:25, for 200$ /night you can get so much better at other hotel and with better location, absolutly nothing that is walking distance.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cReaonable Hotel but needs updating.\u201d", "Author": "alanp_117", "ReviewID": "UR81916569", "Content": "The Hotel isn't bad, but it needs updating, the one of the down buttons on the lifts on the 20th floor had been removed and not replaced and the bath fitting was hanging out of its proper place.

Unfortunately, our new truck was broken into in the underground parking (smashed window) and we had to spend much of our weekend chasing down replacement glass, and arranging pick-up, etc. Thus we did not get to see the Cathedral, China Town, nor the Archeological museum, three of the things that drew us to Montreal. I cannot stress enough how INCREDIBLE Dany Dubois (manager) was in accommodating our ill fortune. He went so far above and beyond the call of duty both before and after the break-in that we all enjoyed ourselves in spite of the incident. He should truly be commended, what a shining example of an employee who TRULY cares about the image of his employer and his hotel. A fine man, and a fine manager. We received excellent service as well from David in security (he allowed us to move the truck to the loading dock for safe keeping) and Cassandra at the front desk. It takes a lot of excellent people to make up for such an unfortunate incident. These people did just that. We hope to return to see the attractions we missed. In regards to the break in: Keep your electronics out of plain sight, and DONT PARK ON THE STREET, especially if you have out of province plates! This part of Montreal is GORGEOUS, but the auto theft and smash-grabs like ours are always an issue. Plan. All the surveillance cameras in the world will not prevent this, you need to be smart. In regards to the town: visit Old Montreal, taking a night stroll while checking out the menus on display outside all these fabulous restaurants.

The hotel wasn't terrible, but there were a few things that bugged me about it. My Mom had thought she had booked a two queen bed room, but turned out it was a two double bed room. It was fine for me, but for my parents sharing a bed was a little cramped. The room is dated, as the door has a chain on it, not a proper deadbolt. The TV was stuck in a cabinet and as a result was hard to see from the far side of the room. As mentioned in other reviews, they need to have window washers as the window was dirty on the outside. The biggest problem with the room, was anytime anyone in another room flushed their toilet, ours gurggled and made a racket. Not the best for sleeping when someone uses theirs at 2 AM. The underground parking is a bit of a pain and technically a rip-off. As it has a hotel guest area and a public area, if you park in the public area it is $20 for a day whereas the hotel charges $22. So if you are planning on spending a day walking and don't need in and out priviledges that day, park in the public lot. As well, the ceilings are very low and as I am a tall man, there was places where I had to duck. Also, they cram the cars in to the point where the stalls are difficult to manoeuver in. Lastly, the slightly annoying \"double ticket\" system is a pain. All hotel guests have one ticket that if you pay their rate are validated for the day. However, to exit the garage, you need to take a second ticket from the public gate and you are given 10 minutes free to exit. The worst part of the hotel is the restaurant. Now granted, my complaint seems to simply be a factor of Quebec culture as it was like this everywhere. But the service stunk, I guess in Quebec you are supposed to spend 2 hours or more at every meal. We ate at the lobby restaurant twice and both times, the food took nearly half an hour. It's not like we ate steaks and lobster, it was merely hamburgers. The other issue I had was how the staff didn't seem to check on you. We'd order and the food would come eventually, but at least here in Saskatchewan, the staff would be back to see how it was tasting. The waiters never did this, we were left with the used dishes sitting on the table for awhile before anyone came by to collect the plates. The plus sides of the hotel are located near the major tourist destination and is attached to the RESO so traveling around Montreal is easy. There is a store that sells what I term \"event du jour\" merchandise. We arrived on Sunday evening after the F1 race and the store was stocked with a selection of both general race merchandise and specific team merchandise. When we checked out on Friday, it had World Cup merchandise. The giftshop also carried a wide variety of English and French newspapers and a selection of magazines. They also have free internet stations set up in the lobby, which supposedly have 15 minute time limits, but they were not strictly enforced. All in all, I would stay at the Delta again, but I'd likely try and stay on a high floor. I assume like most hotels, the higher the floor, the better the room. Staying on the first floor of rooms obviously meant we had the cheapest and least renovated rooms in the hotel.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThey don't honour your reservation\u201d", "Author": "liu2577", "ReviewID": "UR67310827", "Content": "Very disappointed with Delta!

The parking was ok - it is a little tight, especially for our suburban, but my husband did find a space that worked. It was $22 per day. We did not eat in the hotel, but we did check out the rotating restaurant. Dinner was over $50pp for the buffet - it looked like it would be really lovely, but tres cher. We found a nearby restaurant (on McGill - about 3 blocks) to have breakfast. I did use the gym, which had 2 working treadmills, 2 elipicals, 2 bikes, and several weight machines and free weights. It was very hot. They need to fix the AC or get some fans in the room. I'm thinking that since the pool is right next door, they may have an issue with regulating the temperature. I didn't use the pool, but it looked nice, although small. It would be nice if they had chaise seating instead of just chairs.

I don't know what the Delta Hotel is like, but the Delta Centre-Ville does not fit many of the complaints I read. The rooms: Many people claimed this place is dated, but unless you expect a hotel to redecorate every 5 years, it's not true. Our room is spacious, beautiful, clean and definitely in the stylings of the recent 2000's. The big windows provide lots of light. The bathroom is very beautiful and updated. The bed was super-duper comfy. We had such a great sleep. Food- For the food we got, the price was extremely exaggerated!! Two mushroom and cheese omlettes, some home fries, toast, coffee and a tiny class of O.J. cost a whopping $58!!!! The food was good but nothing gourmet enough to warrant that price. It was more expensive than our dinner last night! Montreal is filled with so many spectacular breakfast/brunch places that I DO NOT recommend having breakfast here. I recommend: L'Universal, Cafe Art Java (on Mont Royal), L'Anecdote, Grille Pain, Le Santropol.... Service: We didn't have much exposure to service. The front desk encounter was brief but fine. The waitress that served our breakfast was polite enough but did forget to bring our coffee until we were done our breakfast and took a long time to serve people near us. I think it wasn't her fault but inadequate staffing for such a busy place. Location: some reviews say that this hotel is in a bad location but I disagree totally. From here you are a 2 minute walk to the main train station and Metro which can take you anywhere wonderful in the city, in a very short time. Also, Montreal is a great city to walk through no matter the season ( if it's winter, bundle up!).

We had none of the problems with cleanliness that previous reviewers seem to have experienced. The room on 24th floor was large and comfortable. Some of the furniture in the room seemed a little \"dated\", but this was by far outweighed by the great views of the city from the room which had large floor to ceiling windows. Plenty of space to hang clothes in a walk in wardrobe (again rather old fashioned style) - even managed to get both suitcases in there as well! The room was quiet, but I would recommend you ask for a room on a high floor as the hotel is on a busy junction, so traffic noise may be a problem on a lower floor facing the road. The hotel is in easy walking distance to the old town, the shopping areas and the station and is around 30 mins by taxi from the airport. The reception area is light and spacious, but this feeling is not continued into the bar and restaurant. The restaurant on the ground floor did not look amazingly inviting as it seemed quite dark, although plenty of people were eating there. The bar had no atmosphere at all and could really do with a modernization to make it more inviting. We did not eat at the hotel at all. For breakfast, we walked up to the Via Rail station (turn right and go up the hill - only a few minutes walk) and there is a wonderful little place within the station that cooks the breakfast in front of you while you wait - the panckaes and maple syrup have to be tried!) Alternatively, if you walk through the restaurant and continue through the door at the end, there are esculaters down to various places for breakfast and coffee rather than pay the hotel prices..... There are also lots of places for evening meals in Montreal \"old town\". The swimming pool is rather small and also very deep. My husband is a tall man and even he could not stand in the water in the majority of the area of the pool - definitely not suitable for children.

We stayed at the Hampton for the first couple of nights but booked ourselves downtown for an extra night at the Delta. Let me first say, be careful which one you book! There are actually two Delta locations downtown Montreal, and they are not very far from each other. We actually went to the wrong one at first, and had to go get back in the car and drive around to the other location. Driving in Montreal is very confusing as they have so many one way streets, and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a GPS you are going to end up going on and off a lot of highways! Once we got to the right Delta, they had valet parking in the front, which we opted out of. I found out that we could just park ourselves. Parking was located on the other side of the building and was a little tricky to get to. We ended up driving around the building twice before finding out how to get into the underground parking. It was 22 dollars a night to park, which gave you access to come and go as you please. Luckily we were only staying a night, and although I found it hard to cough up 22 dollars just to park, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any other options so we just went ahead with it. The parking garage is very tight, and a bit small. We took a cab to where we wanted to go, so we luckily got a great parking spot as we arrived around 2pm. I noticed later at night a lot of cars waiting for people to move so they can get a spot, it looked like it was very very hard to find a parking spot in the evening, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about that. The entrance of the hotel is beautiful, it is very elegant and the hotel has 27 floors. Check in was a breeze and the staff was more then friendly. They even advised me to go to the concierge desk and get a map for Old Montreal as they had fireworks that evening. I was so thrilled! She also gave us a room on the 23rd floor which had a fairly good view of downtown Montreal. The room in my opinion was smaller then most hotel rooms I have been in, but it was nice. The bed was super comfy, the pillows were awesome and the bathroom was quite nice. The bathroom had a feeling of being in a spa, and even included some spa soaps and other toiletries. It was very clean and very quiet. Later that evening we got the map from the concierge and went downtown, we saw the fireworks which were the most impressive firework displays I have ever seen. Old Montreal is absolutely gorgeous and very romantic. We decided to take a horse drawn carriage ride which was about 35 minutes in duration. Old Montreal has a lot of unique architecture along with cobble stone roads. It is very busy at night and I would recommend taking a cab. The cab was less then 10 dollars one way from the hotel to the pier where the fireworks were which was right down in Old Montreal. I absolutely loved Montreal! We had breakfast at the restaurant in the morning, which was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I know it was just breakfast, but it was so delicious! The orange juice tasted like it came right out of the orange, and they had so much selection of hot and cold options. We obviously ate way too much as we opted to go for the hot and cold breakfast buffet. It was about 20 dollars each, but was well worth it! All in all I really enjoyed this hotel, it was elegant and clean, and the staff was very friendly. The only negative thing I would have to say is that the room was a bit small. However, the price was great especially for Montreal! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to pay less then $250.00 a night at most hotels downtown Montreal. This one was 179.00 which saved us some money.

I thought it was very grand and beautiful. The staff was friendly. Since I made the online booking first for 2 nights, then a 2nd booking for one more night, so we were assigned two different rooms at check-in. The lady clerk was nice who offered to change it so that we did not have to pack up and move to a different room the next day. Many times when I had questions about directions and airport transportation etc, they were all very friendly and helpful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very conveniently located in Old Montreal, and is not far from the Old Port and China Town. There are underground pathways that connect to Victoria Station and other buildings. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. However, there are some issues that I do hope the hotel will improve on although these issues did not affect our brief stay at the hotel. First, the air-conditioning vent outlet in the room seems to be quite dirty. We could see the part of ceiling where the air is blown against is all blackened, which indicates that airducts need to be cleaned. There is a possibility that they were cleaned but the ceiling had not been repainted since we thought the air was quite fresh. However, the blackened ceiling does scare the guests living within. Second, the bathroom was lacking towel racks. We wanted to support the eco friendly idea by keeping the towels for our 2nd day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay, but once the towels were removed from the cabinet under the sink, we could not find any place to put the wet towels. There are only two small hooks on the walls which don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold big towels very well. Third, the gym is too small and not very well equipped. We have checked it out once but did not use it. There were only 3 treadmills and were all occupied when we visited, and the weights were not secured tightly to the bar, so there is a safety issue here. On the whole, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very nice hotel. Tips on restaurants: All the restaurants in the hotel tend to be pricey. I recommend the followings: Casual meals:`Cr\u00c3\u00aaperie Chez Suzette (3, St-Paul street E.)

The hotel was only one block away from the Square Victoria Metro (Subway) station. We purchased the 3 day Carte Touristique for $17. It gives you 3 days of unlimited transit use. We were within walking distance of many attractions and the shops of Ste. Catherine St. The Delta Centre-Ville's rooms were large, as we had a King sized bed. The bed was very comfortable. The view was to the North, looking upon the office towers and Square Victoria. The washroom was clean and roomy. A nice desk and lots of light. High speed internet was available for a fee. Did not use this on this trip. The only area for improvement was that the wall paper could have used a change...looked a bit dated. The pool on the 4th floor was very nice, with a small, but well equipped gym. Bring your ear phones for the TV's on the treadmills. The pool was quite warm and has two shallow ends with a deep middle. There is a patio off of the pool area. The staff were very personable. There is a small tuck shop on the lobby floor and a small boutique. All staff were fluent in English and en francais. There is a very nice revolving restaurant on the top floor. We viewed the restaurant but did not eat there. Overall, a great stay and service at the Delta Centre-Ville.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cRather Dissapionted\u201d", "Author": "Edd60", "ReviewID": "UR32982732", "Content": "Hotel lobby very nice and well laid out nice and clean staff friendly and helpfull. we had room 1010 which was not that good to be honest bit tatty really , carpets faded, furniture scratched and chipped, the chrome on bath taps had been rubbed away and there was a chip in sink there was also a plastic bag over the extractor? the tv was 1980's deluxe model and the remote didnt work!! lol , also one of out cups had a chip and the windows were not very clean apart from cobwebs on ceilling the room was clean and the bed comfy. when we arrived there was some dicarded pizza boxes and crumbs in the hallway these were still there when we left 3 days later!!

I had to check out with Trip Advisor for a background of the hotel. I was disappointed with the negative reviews but I got valuable tips that made my stay wonderful. The front desk was so accommodating and every hotel staff for that matter was so friendly and helpful. From the reviews, I learned that the premier rooms were recently renovated so I asked to be upgraded for an extra $20/night. We were given a room on the 27th floor overlooking the river -- it was fantastic! No major complaints except for the fact that you have to wait for 30 minutes after check-in before water would be available in your room, There are no notice/signs for this and when I phoned Housekeeping what I got was a rather routine remark of \"wait for 30 minutes.\" I just hope that they will post a sign for this for everybody's convenience. I agree with the reviews that the bathroom lacks some racks to hang towels and that the renovated room did not include newer faucet and door knobs. They should have spent a little more for these. The walk to the Metro station is not that bad and the undergound link is so convenient as well as the food court on the lower level of the bldg. The food court close at 5pm and they are not open on weekends. The food inside the hotel is expensive. Overall, for the price of US$86 a night, this is a steal!

So let me tell you about the pet policy at this hotel because I have had an above average positive experience with this. My wife and I have an 11 pound Maltese dog (small white dog) and this Delta (most Delta hotels) have been very welcoming. They even have a small welcome treat bag for your dog.

I say this because some places say that pets are welcome but the staff (at some hotels) treat you like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dragging a dirty mop through the lobby. Anyway, Delta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pet policy here is very good. There may be a $30 pet fee but we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had to pay this yet and there is no information on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website.

We booked two adjoining rooms for our family of four and got two rooms that were not adjoining and, in fact, not near each other. Our rooms were renovated but they neglected half the hallway which had ripped up linoleum that was not hidden from view. The rooms are very small and ours came complete with an old chewed up apple core under one of the beds! The giant picture window had some sort of disgusting white crud all over it that looked like the glue residue from stickers. There is no mini bar. The bathroom had fixtures from the year one. The sink had cracks. We ordered room service which was supposed to take 45 minutes and took an hour and a half. They got the order wrong and had to wait another half an hour.

It was $149 per night and included access to their Club Lounge (continental breakfast and internet charges included). All in all, it was a good experience. When we arrived it turned out that there was a labour disruption and some of the services expected could not be provided. But since we arrived at 8 pm - we weren't missing out on anything. They told us that everything would be resolved that night by midnight and everything back to normal the next day. With the exception that the whole staff wearing some kind of solidarity t-shirt for the next two days - sure enough we never heard about a labour disruption again. Biggest complaint would be the room itself. It was functional and clean, but the room is definitely more than a little out-dated. And could really use a modern touch, in terms of furniture, paint, and bathroom. Could have been a nice Days Inn. But the bed and bedding were very nice and everything was exceptionally clean and the cleaning service the next day was very good. So no huge complaints. I booked that room primarily because I had to do some work during the weekend and internet was free with the room. This worked effortlessly. Though I just plugged in - and didn't try the Wifi. The continental breakfast was very good. Fresh fruit, pastries, ample coffee, juices, cereals, etc. Though on our second day it seemed completely unattended (labour dispute?) We just loaded up plates and brought them downstairs to our room. We didn't use the pool. It looked ridiculously small. My partner had a massage on our second day and ranked it among the best she's had. Very solid and at $70 for one hour - not a bad price. Estheticians do not work on the weekend apparently. The location is great if you want to visit old Montreal or walk a few blocks north to a main shopping district. We did both and were happy with the location. But it is located on the edge of the financial district and is not pretty or very cultural. Those looking to visit the Plateau or find themselves in the middle of a crazy nightlife scene might look elsewhere. This is not a funky hotel. Parking is kind of pricey at $22 per night - but in keeping with the location. And it's good to know it's nice and safe three miles under ground like that. So all in all - an 8/10. Do wish they'd spruce up the rooms though. Oh, and by the way - we worried about the labour dispute till we walked by the Hilton the next day and saw that their workers were still off the job, had a big truck BLARING rock music - and they were holding up visitors and blowing shrill whistles!

The location was amazing! We parked the car ($22/night) the whole time and walked or took the Metro everywhere. The Notre-Dame Basilica and Old Montreal is down the street a few blocks and we easily walked there everyday without complaint from my 8 year old. The Metro system was less than half a block away (you can also access it from the underground city directly beneath the hotel) and took us everywhere else we needed to go like the Olympic Stadium and Parc du Mont-Royal. When we first arrived there was a sign saying that there were contract disputes with hotel staff and some services (such as room servicing) would be reduced. I was a little worried about that. Check-in was a breeze and we were told the Tour de Ville revolving restaurant was closed and I was a little disappointed but I understand the situation. A bell hop did offer to help us but we didn't have our luggage at the time so we just found the room ourselves. We found the room to be ample size with two double beds. We had feather duvets although only one bed had a duvet cover - the other just had a sheet layed on top. But they were very comfortable. The TV was old and the unit it was in was old and falling apart when we opened it. The bathroom was clean albeit there was little room to place all the toiletries a woman needs. The restaurant downstairs was fine, but a little pricey. We only ate there once as none of us was that fussy about our food. The service was good. For the most part we had breakfasts downstairs in the underground city. You actually have to walk right through the middle of the restaurant to get to it but there is a Second Cup, a Couche-Tard convenience store, MacDonalds, Subway, Thai express and many other fastfood-type places. They all close by 5pm so don't plan on a quick, cheap dinner there. Our room was serviced regularly on the first 2 nights of our stay but the next 2 they did a hasty job. On our third night I had a sick kid so we ordered room service. We were told it would be 25 - 30 minutes but it was closer to 45-50 minutes. The food was no longer hot when it got to us but we were starving by that time. To top it all off no one came back to pick up the tray. We left it outside our room and when we left 2 days later it was still sitting there. Housekeeping just moved it to the side so they could get around it. I do understand that with the contract/service staff issues there would be problems but I was really disappointed by the concierge. Now Montreal has a great nightlife - if you are an adult. As a family there is very little to do at night. We talked to the concierge about anything to do at night. He suggested The Labyrinthe at Hangar 16 however we had just finished doing that (a lot of fun!), and also the planetarium. I asked about the fireworks festival they have on during the summer as I had researched it and found that there was a show on that night - when I asked the concierge about it he said I had the wrong night. Too bad. So we went back to the room and called the planetarium ($1.25 for local calls) and although they have evening shows for adults (not recommended for children under 12) its only on weekend nights. So we ended up sitting in the hotel room watching TV. A little after 9 that night what do I hear? Yep - the sound of fireworks going off. We missed them because of bad info from the concierge. That soured my whole experience. We played in the pool a few times. It was nice, a little busy at night so we swam in the morning when it was quieter.

I had my nails done and had a massage in the hotel salon (Terra on the 4th floor) and would definitely recommend it to anyone. I didn't try out the swimming pool but it looked very appealing.

The bell hop came over, took my key card and asked where my truck was .. I told him in the parking garage and he said \"oh\" and gave me my hotel key back.

He did 'compensate' by giving us a meal at the revolving restaurant upstairs but he did say he'd get back to us and never did.

They did and realized, that infact the pull out couch isn't functional as a bed and brought in a cot.

Stayed here for 4N over Labor Day weekend; got a great rate at travelzoo.com of $95/night. Our room was a good size for a city hotel. We had 2 double beds which were very comfortable. There was also a good size writing desk and sitting area. The bathroom was marbled and a decent size, but the grout was stained which made it look dated. My only complaint on the room was the bathroom lighting; it consisted of 2 large, long light fixtures on each side of the mirror, you couldn't dim or unloosen a bulb. Other than that room was fine. I want to mention the great bartender we had. Her name was Mary-Claude and she was both professional and fun. She worked the bar in Antoine's restaurant. Her service level was outstanding. Avoid parking in the garage that the hotel provides for $20 CAD day; it's expensive and hard to maneuver around once inside. Instead, opt for one of the cheaper and plentiful outside parking lots that offer in and out priviledges from 10-12 CAD day.

Except for some issues i'll point out later, this hotel is generally a very good place to stay. My first advice is to always consider spending a few dollars more to get a Signature room. Located on the upper floors (read: fantastic view), those rooms come with more refined furnishing and appliances, and a very worthy access to the 26th floor Signature Lounge (right under the revolving rooftop restaurant; wonderful). For a little less, Premier rooms (newly refurbished) would also be a wise choice. Otherwise, regular rooms (those called Delta rooms) are still pleasant and well equipped. For around 55 $ CAD / person + taxes and tip, their revolving rooftop restaurant is not that overpriced, since it features very sophisticated theme buffets, splendid view, great cozy atmosphere are smooth service. While middle-to-high class hotel restaurants are generally soulless and too costly, this one may be worth the visit. There are some downsides, however. First, as some other user pointed out, there are issues with their front desk staff. Though check-in was not troublesome in my case, I've experienced something disturbing. When I asked for a specific cab company to the stone-faced employee, he couldn't care less and turned me away rudely, as he just did with a guest who, before me, asked for some directions. I hope this was just a mishap. Also, their inside pool, while good-looking, is rather small and the pool area is stifling. Not hot tub. Finally, just as an anecdote, Delta is the 5th name this hotel bears since its opening in 1977. First opened as R\u00c3\u00a9gence Hyatt, then switched to Le Grand Hotel, Gouverneur, Radisson and finally Delta.

He even showed me which button to push in the elevator to go down to the lobby. Now, this might seem trivial, but it demonstrated to me that even the littlest detail didn't get overlooked. I had a standard room with 2 queen beds. For it's class, the room was slightly smaller than most hotel rooms I've stayed in Montreal, but the bed was comfortable and the linens and pillows were great. I enjoy views, so having a floor-to-ceiling window was great. The swimming pool is small and often overrun by kids, so I didn't partake. They had a nice size fitness room with lots of equipment. I prefer the long walks around the city and under the city. The underground tunnel system is accessible, oddly enough, by walking through the lobby restaurant. I had dinner at the rotating rooftop restaurant called Tour de Ville. I was thoroughly impressed by the views, and totally satisfied by the quality of the food and service. It's pricey, but considering the food, the furnishings, and the views, I think it was fairly priced. On the down side...there's no hot tub in the pool area.

We were assigned the Delta Centre-ville for $92 (plus the huge Canadian taxes). After a 12 hour train ride into town, we were happy to see the hotel was only about 2 blocks from the train station. The lobby was typical for a convention hotel, nothing special. Our room was on the 20th floor and was a bit smaller than what we were expecting. It had a pretty good view out the large window, all the rooms here have some view of the city. We were disappointed to see that the room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the amenities a 4* hotel should have. No fridge or minibar, no safe, no wireless internet, ect. We had to rent a fridge for an extra fee, but it was well worth it and it was a big one. The hotel is in a location that is near the convention center and train station. It is about a 10 minute walk to where all the action is on St. Catherine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s street. The port, unknown to us until the last few days, is on the other side of the hotel, about 5-10 minutes away. The area is pretty dead at night, and it was a terrible task to find food in the area on the weekend. However, the metro is accessible by 2 stops near the hotel, one of which is found without even going outside. The concierge was helpful, but often times there were a long wait. There was also a computer with internet that guests could use in the lobby for 15 minutes free, again always a line to use it. The pool area was small, as most city hotel areas are. There was a good sized fitness center and a sauna but no whirlpool. The \"spa\", as it is advertised on some sites, is really no more than a one room massage area for guests. I found the sundeck outside looking over the city to be relaxing in the afternoon. The hotel has two restaurants, a bar and bistro which serves a buffet breakfast and light lunch, and the revolving fine dining restaurant on the 28th floor. We ordered room service one night and although it was quickly delivered to our room, the food was lackluster and overpriced as expected. However, one of the highlights of our trip was eating at the restaurant at the top of the hotel. Saturday night they have a buffet that is quite expensive and quite good. The staff was excellent up there and we tried everything: deer, pork, salmon, lobster, shrimp, roast beef, and the list goes on. All and all, the Delta Centre-ville was a good value for the price we paid. We have been to better hotels, but this one served our needs fine.

I might feel a little differently if we'd paid the hotwire-type prices (under $100), but we paid the room block rate of the convention we booked with ($199). As one of my colleagues in the room block said \"they don't know our group, they don't care about our group\" and that was for sure. Luxe hotels like W and Place des Armes were only slightly higher priced with significantly better facilities, services and amenities. The front desk staff general attitude was generally that customers are irritating distractions from other, more important issues - and if there is a problem, its likely the customer's fault. Specific examples: -Two days before our arrival, the hotel lost power in a storm, and with it their electronic registration system. For the records they couldn't reconstruct (like ours), the first option they presented was not to deal with us at all. I pretended I was certain they'd find me a bed, and when I didn't slink away, the front desk staffer finally gave up and went to find a manager to ok us checking in. None of the payment arrangements that were made ahead by our group survived the power outage, so many arrangements that we'd made were lost. We requested one type of room configuration and were given another so had to switch rooms. The entire check-in process from beginning to having an acceptable room took nearly one hour. -Amenities were delivered for our group - and ours arrived at 10:45 pm. We were already in bed! -Room service took 90 minutes and the waiter looked like it had been a very long, short-staffed night. -Ice machines are on every other floor, and those above and below us were down for the count, so I went to the bar . . . where the barista told me there were ice machines on even floors. She eventually got me some ice when I explained that they didn't work (the assumption that the customer is dumb . . . ) -Upon checkout, the clerk told us he could not open our folio to put two names on the bill, essential for both of us filling out our expense reports. Although he said it was impossible, another attack of deafness on my part proved that he could indeed perform this feat with the assistance of someone who knew how to do it, so we got what we needed eventually. The room, although obviously recently renovated as evidenced by the high quality mattress and bedding and HD flat screen TV, was dirty and beat up. Every day we discovered OPH (other peoples' hair) in our bathroom, and the low thread-count towels were stamped \"Delta Centre Ville\" a la prison underpants to keep guests from stealing them. Turndown service was provided, and a free bottle of water . . . even though there were two guests in the room. Guess we have to do rock, paper scissors for it. Three plusses: the hotel is old, so the closet is old, which means that it is quite large with lots of rod space and floor space - perfect for two women traveling together who have lots of convention costume changes. The second plus was the bathroom lighting - the best makeup mirror lighting I have ever experienced. Third, the hotel is very conveniently located for Vieux Montreal and for the convention center - I could walk back and forth to convention activities, even in heels. On an eco-front: incandescent light bulbs throughout, burning away. How about some compact flourescents? No in-room recylcing. This hotel would be ok for under $100, but compared to the other properties and prices in our convention block, represented atrocious price per value and very surly treatment by front desk.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat price for what you get\u201d", "Author": "IT-Expert", "ReviewID": "UR8126136", "Content": "Great price, well-located (a few blocks from the edge of Old Montreal), very easy to find.

We were concerned when the booking was Delta, given some of the reviews here. But our regular Delta room was MUCH larger than our 'club' level room at the Sheraton. The Delta is much closer to Old Montreal - in fact, it's just a couple of blocks from the edge of Old Montreal. We walked to Notre Dame in 10 minutes. The Delta is also easy access to the highway, being right on University Avenue. The concierge during the day was much better than the concierge late at night. The desk staff cheerful.

The pool and the workout rooms are just OK; note that you have to be 16 to workout.

Yes, the hotel has apparently renovated upper-floor rooms. Of course, through Hotwire, we got a deal on lower floor rooms. I got concerned, would we have ancient furniture, other problems, etc. So I followed some advice and joined the hotel's preferred club, for free, yet saw I would not get a free upgrade just from that. Called the hotel to find we had two double beds with no single queens or kings left available. Had the phone receptionist make a note that we preferred a single large bed if available. I called phone reception, both for the hotel and for the preferred membership several times, and they were always exceptionally polite and accomodating, sweet, really. Yet they couldn't do much for us as far as the bed or the higher floor were concerned. Showed up at the hotel. Were invited to upgrade to a top floor room for $20 a night. What a steal. Got a corner room with a fantastic view, king size bed with pillowtop mattress, bathrobes and all the amenities. Total $240 for two nights, it benefited us to book on the weekend as this was a business hotel mostly booked for the week. Their Sunday brunch looked fantastic but we opted out as it was $35 per. Found a few local restaurants after a bit of searching that were wonderful. Check-in and -out were a breeze, as were cabs to and from the hotel, flat rate from the airport of $35. The concierge Sebastian was a dream come true when we asked to be directed to non-touristic restaurants. Again, the receptionist as well was a dream come true, all our questions answered, all our issued resolved with the preferred membership. I would stay at this hotel anytime. If you get one of the cheaper low floor rooms, I can't say what issues they may have. If you turn down a $20 upgrade to a pillowtop king mattress, I can't help you. If you can't find the place with the 20 plus different kinds of mussels or the little cafe with poutine and smoked meat, drop me a line. Go to Old Montreal but don't fall for the restos there. And maybe have the Sunday brunch buffet at the rooftop resto if you are feeling flush, it can't be bad. We prefer the local places.

Average food, endless waiting at breakfast for the \"wait to be seated\" lady (15 Minutes in a queue like in socialist Moscow) - not even two star standard on this one. The greatest plus are the staff: Extremely helpful and friendly, even with special/unusual requests. Check In/Check Out works swiftly. In total: value for money rather poor. Are there much better ones in Montreal?", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, B.C.", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great price\u201d", "Author": "AdvisorKing", "ReviewID": "UR6806235", "Content": "I took my 9 year old son across the country to Montreal (my home town) to see two Montreal Canadiens games (go Habs!). We stayed three nights. The hotel was typical of a business hotel. The rooms were a little larger than average. The hotel is in a perfect location. A couple easy blocks (even in -18C weather) west to Bell Centre and about the same north to St. Catherine Street. The room rate was $129 ($151.41 with taxes). I had no problem with the bill and no problem with the service. The staff were always willing to speak English whenever my very rusty French wasn't cutting it. Room service was excellent -- the food was delivered quickly, it was excellent, they didn't skimp on quantity, and it wasn't insanely expensive like you sometimes expect. My two complaints are minor. I was charged $1.25 each time I dialed the toll-free number to make long distance calls with my calling card. I would have been better off phoning home with my cell phone and paying airtime and long distance rates. My son enjoyed to pool, but they have no hot-tub/whirlpool.

However, on our second day the cleaner arrived at 5:30pm to clean our room! We had been out of the room between 9am and didn't return until 5pm that day so they had plenty of time to clean it. We were only there two nights so I can't say whether this is normal cleaning routine. I wonder why she was so late cleaning it? Don't they employ enough cleaners to go through the number of rooms they have? Did someone quit without notice? Was it an oversight? Otherwise, I was quite happy with the experience and would return to the Delta Centreville: the hotel is well located; everything was comforable and in good condition; the rooms didn't smell of smoke, smut or (grrr) horrible air fresheners; we couldn't hear neighbours; and the staff were pleasant, helpful (except for cleaning) and informative.

We arrived after an abysmal experience at University Bed & Breakfast and were lucky to get a pair of rooms at the Delta on a busy Labor Day weekend. Based on the reviews here, I did not expect much from the Delta. I was very pleasantly surprised. Our rooms were extremely clean, comfortable, and restful, with amazing views. The restaurant was accomodating about providing milk or kid-food (chicken nuggets, French fries, etc) at any time of day or night, even when they were closed. The hotel provided a small refrigerator for our room to keep food & milk for our toddler and our aunt's medicine. The buffet breakfast was perfect with a small child and the waitstaff very patient and helpful. All of the hotel staff from the front desk to the concierge were lovely and accommodating for any request small or large. We enjoyed the pool and the children's playroom, which allowed one parent to sleep in while the other romped about with our son. It was easy to walk to many destinations from the hotel, especially Old Montreal. I can't say enough wonderful things about the Delta -- we all relaxed and had a great time because of their stellar hospitality. For a great trip to Montreal with a small child, all you need is the Delta Centre-Ville and a sturdy stroller. With a rental car to get you to the Biosphere and other more remote locations, you'll be totally set for a good time!", "Date": "July 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFine hotel\u201d", "Author": "moominoid", "ReviewID": "UR5222413", "Content": "Perfectly fine business/conference hotel in the centre of downtown Montreal near the old city and newer business districts.
