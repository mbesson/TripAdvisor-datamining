Some might prefer to be a little more centrally located, but it was a quick walk to restaurants, good shopping. Check out the upgrade levels as a nomimal fee often results in a much nicer room. We were here for business purposes, but built in a few extra days for touring Madrid. The location was selected to be near to the company's offices. While there are good options for restaurants and shopping, and a really nice district isn't too far a walk, you might prefer to take a cab or excellent metro system to the major museums. We also liked this section as it seems less frenetic than being right downtown. One thing to know about NH Hotels: this company seems to buy older properties and renovate them to modern standards for a good business class hotel. Since we've stayed at more than one, we've learned to ask about upgrade options and checked a few out. Here, a standard room will likely be small and have a window on the interior atrium. For slightly more than that, you get basically the same rather small room, with an outside window. For slightly more than that, we got a very spacious room with an outside window, separate dressing area, etc. Room #504 is classified a junior suite, but I'd describe it more as a spacious room with a sitting area with sofa, chair, good work desk, etc. The general decor is sleek and modern, e.g. wood floors; blond wood furniture; neutral tones. The king bed was very comfortable, but the bedside reading lights could be brighter. Also: there were the duvets that are often found in hotels these days, which I find too warm, even with the AC cranked up. (Have managers noticed that the AC bills have been higher with the adoption of duvets?) There was a coffee/tea maker, but we often just got tea replaced unless we asked. In-room safe. A nice refrigerator where you could put in a few of your own bottles, in addition to what was in the mini-bar. In this type of room, there is a separate tub and shower in the bathroom, and lots of nice toiletries. The sink is in a dressing area that has an open closet, i.e. no doors that hide the contents of what you brought. Excellent housekeeping throughout. Very helpful, friendly, and professional staff at the desk for tourist help, recommendations, etc. There is free wifi in the lobby, using password codes in 30-minute increments. This works well enough, unless you are in the middle of something when the time runs out. It costs 10+ euro if you want it in the room on a 24-hour basis. There is a nice cocktail lounge for drinks, tea, etc. The breakfast room and restaurant are pleasant. The breakfast buffet has a nice array of breads and parties, fruits and juices, meats and cheese, etc. There are newspapers in the lobby, but all in Spanish.

The NH Abascal is not smack in the center of Bourbon Madrid but then again, if you ahve travelled to Madrid often, you know better.

We were happy to hear that they could find us a room anyway, but once IN the room, the feeling soon faded away. It was just unbelievably noisy! The room was located right above the sliding doors of the hotel entrance and you could here every single car and truck driving by as if you were outside on the pavement. As a bonus you could also hear all the people in the neighbouring rooms. The room was also freezing cold. After a few hours of sleep, we got up and asked for another room. We were offered a junior suite for an additional 15 euro charge per night. Since this room was really quiet (facing the inner courtyard), we were happy to pay extra. Unfortunately this room did not seem to have any air conditioning and the air got really stuffy very fast... And the beds. Oh dear. Could they possibly make more noise when one is just turning over? The bathroom was OK (and really big), the TV seemed to work just fine, the minibar seemed to be as old as the building.
