{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't Stay There! The place - and the room was filthy, there were bed bugs in the beds and the room was in a very bad state. It doesn't look like what they show on their web site - far from that. When we wished reject the room and leave the place, the owner told us that we were free to leave, but he'd charge our credit card anyway (we'd given him the credit card details when we made the booking), so we had to stay for one night. It was awful and I woke up the next morning with bites from the bugs all over my body and we decided to skip breakfast as it looked horrible and we knew how they didn't seem to care about cleanliness.I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. We spoke to severaltravellers who felt the same way and we believe these people live from cheating people by showing fake pics on their internet site and refusing people to leave when they see how it is in reality.Only good thing about this place is the location. But please... don't stay there! Not even if you're desperate!", "Date": "Jul 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR434437611", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Copenhagen_girl"}, {"Content": "Not the worst place to stay... This hostel wasn't all that bad. They were nice to me and always trying to help me out with my problems (I lost my luggage, I got lost in Florence...) They tried to help, but I'm am not fluent in Italian and they are not fluent in English. Here is my exprience:-When I frist arrived (after being lost for about an hour with no luggage) they told me that they over booked. I was about to start some drama, but before I had the chance, they gave me a suite for the night.-One of the guys who worked there offered to help me find a place to use the internet on his own time.-They removed my stuff from my room when it was time to move to another room. The problam with that was that my tote bag is totally open and anyone could have reached right in and taken anything out of it.-The morning I was leaving, I was going to the train station to get a ticket and they told my that I had to remove my stuff from my room right away. So I ran up stairs and packed in a hurry and ended up leaving one my outfits behind. Come two weeks later, they still couldn't find it!-And, in my opinion, some of the guys who worked there were pretty cute so that made up for a little bit of my drama!But all in all, I thought it would be worse but it wasn't too bad becaus I only used it to sleep at.", "Date": "Jan 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR901753329", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "I would rather sleep on the streets than stay at this hotel The hotel fiorentina is the most filthy, appalling and disgusting place I have ever had the misfortune of encountering.The room was foul, the shower was in the room and was tiny, the beds were uncomfortable (you could actually feel the springs digging into your back as you slept). THe toilets were foul and you could not lock them, there was also a nasty smell throughout the hotel, similar to that of sick, which made your eyes water.Do not stay here, sleep on the streets if you have to but do not come anywhere in the vicinity of this excuse for a hotel.Oh and also there was a lizard climbing up the wall of our room and it is riddled with mosquitoes.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR761124459", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Appalling Filthy Ramshackle Hotel Arrived late at night to find that they had no record of my internet booking. They've described themselves as fluent English/French... but no one spoke any English. I did my best with the phrase book, but 'this room is filthy I want another' only gets you so far.As you go into the hotel, you go through a stone stair case which looks pleasant enough. When you go in to the ground floor lobby you realise it's falling to bits, wires hanging out, plastic sheets and tools about the place. In the very dubious lift up to the Hotel... you get a sense of what the place might be like. It was a very stressful experience, the room and bathroom were filthy. Imagine the worst 70s bedsit you can picture, and then add in about 20 years more dirt. Wires were hanging out of the wall, grotty old showers in the middle of one of the rooms. They were incredibily rude to an old American couple, who spoke no English, and because of a disability needed a bathroom in their room. They shouted at them, and it was a very threatening environment.Please don't ruin your time in lovely lovely Florence by staying here.
