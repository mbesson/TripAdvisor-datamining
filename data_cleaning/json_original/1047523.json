Communication was a struggle as none of the staff can speak English though they acted friendly. A clean standard room,no bath(just shower) and you can hear the noise from the next room. It's appalling that the towels were not changed for 5 days, although they tidy the room everyday. Breakfast is boring, we ate mostly outside. No ironing facilities,no kettle to make hot drinks at night,thinking that this is a 4 star we were talking about. The spa is a laugh, the space is so small .The location is hard to find,luckily we booked a shuttle so we were dropped off in front of the hotel upon arrival otherwise it is so hard to find. It's near the Ottaviano metro ok but there are hotels nearer to it. It wasn't worth the price you paid for. Don't be fooled by the pictures.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cA Stress Haven Ain't Santa\u201d", "Author": "OnlyChatru", "ReviewID": "UR120852086", "Content": "Arrived in the hotel late midnight after a trouble getting into for a metro ride that operates only until 10pm (MA1). We were attended with the night security guard alone. Not English speaker but fair enough to deal about. Room were reserved but shocked to find out that the the shower room covered with clear glass alone and has no door is separated from the toilet there is no shower curtain even. The repair and renovation is going on. Housekeeping is fantastic but the total furnish of the building itself is surprisingly at low costs. This is a typical place for bread and breakfast and not to call a hotel. I understand there were only a few rooms available for guest as the sittings for breakfast which was served only with ham and bread with coffee has only 7 small tables. The receptionist in the day time are fine and friendly but cannot speak English and hard to communicate needless to say. The place is 4 blocks away from the St. Peter's Basilica and Vatican Museum. Though it is an ideal stay to consider but the accommodation is rated LOW to me. I do not recommend staying in this hotel if there are other choices to take nearby ST. Peter. The Hotel is hard to find and there is almost at the back part of the area. Too dangerous for a walk at night.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cYou can find better\u201d", "Author": "Kose", "ReviewID": "UR119842574", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel in early October. We booked very last minute and had limited selection. The location of the hotel is convenient. Only a 5 min. walk from Ottaviano metro station, and only 15 minutes from the Vatican. There are a couple of great restaurants very close by. At first glance, this hotel looks very modern and chic as it has a spa on the main floor. Staff was friendly. The rooms and main areas were kept very clean. Our room had some deficiencies though. Our bathroom door didn't open all the way. We had to squeeze in sideways. The shower didn't drain properly. The toilet seat was also half falling off. We mentioned our concerns to the front desk staff who said they would look into it, but it was never taken care of.There was a lot of noise from the street and the room next door. Walls are thin. We could hear every conversation next door perfectly. Breakfast was very minimal. Most days they had run out of ham and salami. It didn't seem to matter what time we had breakfast. For this price, I think you can find better in the same area.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cit was ok\u201d", "Author": "gardas96", "ReviewID": "UR117899184", "Content": "Hotel room was as described. Just a few complaints. Unfortunately mini fridge not working. Complained about fridge as my husband had medication which needed to be kept cool. Result was they moved us to another room which was larger. Pillows were far too soft. We ended up having neck and shoulder pain. Breakfast was non existent.
