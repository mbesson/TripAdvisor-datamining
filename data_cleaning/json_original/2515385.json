Free shuttle service. Located a stone's throw from Seatac Airport. Cons: Extremely worn property. Heating/Cooling units in rooms smell of mold & mildew. Inconsistent service. The Clarion Hotel Seattle Airport has seen better days. It is an extremely worn out property that lacks consistent maintenance and housekeeping (e.g. peeling paint, holes in walls, broken furniture, etc.). Having said that, it is also on the cheap side, so the old adage that \"you get what you pay for\" rings true here. Now, I've stayed in several different rooms on the property, including the suites. Unfortunately, everywhere you go there is a musty smell permeating. This is just one of those properties that has you thinking \"ewww\" everywhere you go. To make matters worse, the customer service here seems as tired and apathetic as the building. In fairness, it appears that the front desk is woefully short staffed for the amount of traffic they get from airport patrons. In the several trips I've made to this property, it appears there is only one employee per shift for check-ins, reservations, wake-up calls, phone lines and customer requests. The bottom line is that if you only need to spend one night near the airport, this hotel is tolerable.

Not a lot of choice, so I was happy to have a clean bed. The place is more a motel, very worn around the edges (faux woodgrain worn off the edges of furnishing, revealing the fine pressboard underneath), though clearly effort has been made to keep it clean. Staff at checkin were friendly in spite of the travel mayhem, and the bed was comfortable and clean. The restaurant offered only a \"dinner buffet\" for $14.95, with some of the sorriest looking food I've ever seen. It honestly looked like they were running out of food, and reheated whatever they could rustle up. No restaurants in walking distance. I couldn't bring myself to eat any of it, and opted for something from the vending machine and the emergency energy bar in my carryon--better food in the airport. The bathroom was a bit of a disaster, with a leak in the ceiling (a real hole) dripping into the tub. Looks like someone tried to patch it--with paint! It's probably from the shower upstairs, which, if it's anything like this one, gets water all over the floor, since the shower rod is not strong enough to hold up the shower curtain when it gets wet and has pulled out of the wall, bunching the curtain up in the middle. Grout failing, wallpaper stained, not a pretty site, but an obvious effort has been made to keep it clean. Internet free, extra charge for above 1024. Comfy bed, but lumpy pillows. There is a guest laundry, something I wish more upscale hotels would have (I still remember the night one of the kids was sick in the night, the hotel was happy to do sheets, but we had to wash jammies in the sink).

Clearly housekeeping needs some training. You can't really miss the flaws. The carpets need a thorough vacuuming along the edges.

Considering that this hotel seems to be heavily used by airlines for their frustrated passengers, that is especially welcome. If you need a place to crash immediately before or after your flight, this hotel might do in a pinch, but I am certain there are better options out there. If you don't need to be near the airport, steer clear of this area altogether.", "Date": "September 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corvallis, OR", "Title": "\u201cOK Place for a family\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2460075", "Content": "Spent the weekand at the Clarion Hotel Seattle Airport. The staff was very freindly and I enjoyed the facilities. The indoor pool was fun and it was nice to be able to excersise in the room next to the pool so I could watch the kids. Had breakfast in the restaurant and thought it was a good value. We plan to be back in a few months and plan to stay there again.", "Date": "August 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot the best not the worse\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2432687", "Content": "Don't let the picture on Expedia fool you because this hotel is pretty ugly from the outside. But if you are looking for a semi-comfortable stay at a resoanable price before going back home, this may be for you. In general, the restaurant closed an hour and a half before the actual closing time and the staff was not particularly friendly. The room was clean eventough the water for the morning shower was lukewarm. The air from the vent blew the curtains upwards. My kids did enjoy the indoor pool and the world pool was nice. I would suggest getting a room opposite the airport since there is hardly any noise on that side. The bottom line is if you don't have a lot of money, this is not a bad place", "Date": "August 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA great Airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1930939", "Content": "A very nice Airport Hotel. Located across the street from the Airport. Set back about 1/4 block, so there is little or no traffic noise. Also, no noise from the Airport to speak of. The rooms are very clean, the bathrooms the same. The staff friendly. There is a restaurant and bar on site. Free shuttle serivce to and from the airport. For the price, it is great value.

You might as well sleep on a bench at the airport, it would be less hassle. The rooms are ugly and dirty and the service is horrible. We got to our room and the bathroom lights wouldn't work. After talking to the desk person three times, she finally realized that it really wans't working and that maybe I did understand how to operate the lights. She was going to send up a key for a new room but forgot. I had to remind her. Hotels like this don't stay in business long...thank heavens.", "Date": "December 28, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenville SC", "Title": "\u201cFind somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR833243", "Content": "Not a 3 star in my opinion. No heat in bathroom, and the tile floor was cold. The heat/ac unit in bedroom blows the curtain up, and we were on the first floor, this allowed anyone walking by to look into our room. The furnishings were shabby. Even though we had a king room for 2 toilitries were left for only one person. There were no luggage carts to move our suitcases to the room.
