{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Service and Location The hotel and its rooms are small as mentioned, but the service is great and it's only one short stop away from the Tokyo JR Station so you can pretty much go anywhere with a JR pass without much station hopping.It's also just steps away from the JR Shinnihombashi Station. The thing about that station, though, is that there are no escalators or elevators taking you to street level so if you're carrying a suitcase, you'll need to haul it up a few flights of stairs. Overall, a pleasant experience for the price but you'll want to take a taxi from the Tokyo Station if you're not backpacking.", "Date": "Mar 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR114616344", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "cl1976"}, {"Content": "Loved Breakfast time This was our Tokyo base of operations when we visited. It was almost as though the hotel was minutes away from anything we wanted to see in Tokyo. Only drawback is there were few bars in the area. However, we're going back in March and we're staying at the Kazusaya again. The little lady at breakfast was what I think made us like the place the most. The staff guys were very nice and accommodating. I'd recommend this place if you didn't want to stay in the normal foreign hangouts of Tokyo.", "Date": "Feb 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR497928279", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "flyboy2101"}, {"Content": "Great little place We only stayed one night, and although the room was small it was very clean and comfortable. staff were very accommodating when we couldn't pay until check-out (most hotels in Japan require payment at check-in) because the banks were closed and we couldn't get our money exchanged to Yen until the next morning. It is right behind shin-nihombashi JR station and 1 stop from tokyo station, so very convenient. Highly recommended for those who are fussed about cleanliness (and we definitely are) but at a great price. for 11000 yen (in tokyo) we were very happy with the place and would stay there again.", "Date": "Apr 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR812609568", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "feenix"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d557541-r14646709-Kazusaya_Hotel-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "557541", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
