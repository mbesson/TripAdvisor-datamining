Still a pretty good deal if you are staying short term and want to head straight from the bus station to the airport - bathrooms are still in good condition, bed comfortable, and rooms quiet. Our A/C was not working as well as I would have liked. One new addition to the service: Volaris has a desk in the lobby, and you can buy tickets there, or even buy a shuttle to the airport (they offer 8-10 seater passenger vans from the One directly to the airport that will likely get you there 2 hours ahead of your flight). Still pretty convenient all around, but if you're staying longer term, you might want to check out some of the vacation condo rentals around as you'll have more amenities with these options.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Enschede", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly good hotel and convenient location near ADO bus station\u201d", "Author": "spikey82", "ReviewID": "UR116000641", "Content": "This is a surprisingly good hotel, also considered the location, 20 meters from ADO first-class bus station. We we tired of our backpacks and wanted a convenient room fast, so this hotel was the first option. It is brand-new, standard rooms have cable-tv, good aircon, superb bathroom and good beds, though not 2 meters large, and free strong WiFI. The first night we paid the rack rate, 870 pesos and we booked a second night. The online rate is cheaper and when we mentioned this, we could just book online one night and stay in the same room. The hotel has no pool, so it's not a beach holiday or swimming hotel, but for a short stay-over this is really a good hotel. Rooms are also pretty quiet, which is impressive considered its location. Book upfront online (20% cheaper) or if you get there and mention this at the counter. Decent breakfast too, included in the price.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for the Price\u201d", "Author": "SheenaJ", "ReviewID": "UR113086137", "Content": "Clean, basic rooms, we stayed for two weeks, and could have used more hanging space, and some drawers to unpack properly, however for the price for great, friendly staff, and excellent breakfast included in the price.

There is a great tapas place just kiddy corner to the hotel, and it is right across from the ADO bus station so easy to get to. Great fares online - better than what they will offer you as a walk in so check out www.bestday.com.mx or similar sites for good prices. Oh, and there is also free laundry facilities.

Bathroom was nicely sized, with nice large tiles on walls of shower and granite counter top. Free Wi-fi throughout. About 4 blocks from the main drag (restaurants/bars/etc along Ave 5) of Playa and 5 - 6 blocks from beach. Wal-Mart is one block south and a mega-mart one block north. Literally 5 min walk to all the action tho it does seem a little 'out of the way'. One of the two bus stations in Playa is next door but I didn't hear any noise and was not bothered at all.

Esepcially if you are taking buses throughout Quintana Roo, the location is great. There is also not much noise from the bus station at all. At least, we did not notice any from our room 106. There was breakfast offered in the morning and although it was not the best breakfast I have had, it was certainly not bad. They offered eggs, ceral, toast and chilaquiles between 7am and 11am. The front desk staff was very helpful, and they have computers available for use in the lobby. The internet also worked very well in the rooms.
