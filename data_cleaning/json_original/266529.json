This hotel is the best one if you decide to celebrate in Puerta del Sol Square. Most of the rooms are just in front of this place so you and your family or friends can spend the night in the balcony of your room looking the TV (the celebration is transmitted by TVE1, one of the television channel in Spain) and the crowded people in the Square. Really it is very excited! The room, as usual, very clean. The Staff are excellent, specially Raul, Javier and the other personnel who attend the Front Desk. The hotel has Wifi and two computers in the Lobby, available for customers free of charge. As always be aware that the room rate rises considerably from December 29, 30 and 31. In addition, the security box should be requested and the charge is approximately 2 euros per day. This hotel is centrally located so you have a lot of shops, restaurants and cafeterias around. The hotel has his own Restaurant-Cafeteria which opens very early in the morning and offers breakfast, lunch and dinner and also room service to the customers. Just in front of the hotel you have the Sol Metro Station, which is very useful for your transfer to the Airport or to the AVE train to Sevilla, Valencia or Barcelona (you can take the Sol Metro to Atocha Station to connect with the AVE train).

After months of researching and based on the good reviews from TA travelers and also Rick Steves\u2019 Madrid and Toledo guide, we decided to use the Hotel Europa as our second home away from USA while we were visiting the city of Madrid. The reservation process was very smooth. As soon as we decided to stay at this hotel, I immediately sent them an e-mail inquiring about availability, prices, services and cancelation policies and Mr. Garaban, always responded to my e-mails in a very promptly manner. He answered all my questions and gave me all the information that I need it. After sent them a couple of e-mails and talked to them on the phone, I was able to send my reservation by e-mail and I received the confirmation e-mail from Mr. Garaban a few minutes later. Unfortunately, we were forced to change our entire trip itinerary a few weeks prior to our trip to Madrid due to changes on the airline\u2019s schedule. So I had to contact the hotel in order to modify our reservation and without any problems Mr. Garaban updated our reservation. Check in-out: When we arrived in the early morning hours to the hotel, the check in process was very fast. When it was time for us to check out they had our check ready and it did not have any hidden fees. The guys on the front desk were very friendly and efficient. Room: Because we arrived around 8:00AM the room that I requested previously (double bed-matrimonial) was not ready, they told us that there was a room ready with a double bed which was like two twin beds put together. Honestly, because we were so tired, we did not care about the type of bed so we accepted that room. To our surprise, the room was located in the fourth floor and it was one of the corner rooms. It has two windows and we were right in front of Puerta Del Sol. This room overpassed our expectations. For us it was amazing! The room had a double bed (two twins beds put together), an LCD TV with international channels, a big closet, a desk, a safety box which you need to pay a fee if you are using it and of course the room has a big and clean bathroom. Noise level: Our room was sound and light proof BUT because this room is right on Puerta Del Sol, we heard some noise. Not a big deal for us but If you are a light sleeper, you should bring earplugs. One thing that I want to add and please do not take this comment as a negative for the hotel on the contrary I think is more like an interesting fact is that if you are in the rooms facing Puerta del Sol and if you are in bed, you will feel some light tremors. These tremors are very light and are caused because underneath of Puerta Del Sol is the train-metro station, therefore every time that a train-metro passes, you will feel the tremor. I don\u2019t know if the guests on the interior rooms feel the tremors but I did when we stayed in the rooms facing Puerta Del Sol. Interesting fact! I would like to write more good things about this hotel but I don\u2019t want to make this review like an essay. The only thing that I know is that if I go back to Madrid, I will stay again at the hotel Europa without any doubts.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Williamsburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "OahuHawaii", "ReviewID": "UR121734554", "Content": "We spent 4 nights at this Madrid hotel.

The air-conditioned rooms were of a good size, tastefully decorated (I thought) and clean. There's a shower and a good hairdryer in the bathroom. We had a room with a balcony over the square, which made for very entertaining people-watching late at night with a cool breeze and a bottle of wine. I know some people complained about the noise level on the Puerta del Sol, especially those who stayed during the protests. We did hear some of that going on, but it was during the day when, by all rights, you should be out seeing the incredible city you came to visit. Also, with the AC, outer shutters, windows, and heavy drapes, it was easy to blot out the noise. I also thought the adjoining cafe was a great place to stop off for cafe or croissant or tortilla and fresh-squeezed orange juice (our favorite breakfast of champions) in the morning before diving back into the city at large. I thought the staff at the front desk were also friendly and helpful with pretty good English when you need it. One concierge in particular was instrumental in helping us figure out directions to various spots around the city and to the train station for our jaunt from Madrid to San Sebastian. Some people complained about leaving the key at the front desk, which is just a silly thing to harp on. In all honesty, it's for everyone's safety. The heart of any big city has unsavory characters roaming around, and the key system enables the staff to monitor that everyone who comes in is staying there. It never took more than 10 second to get the key at the desk when we came in. My one and only complaint is that there was no access to an iron--not in the room and not at the front desk. There was a laundry service where you could pay something like 7 euro to have an article of clothing pressed, but it required a day to turn it around. When I get into town and I'm pulling clothes out of a suitcase, rumpled and full of creases, I need an iron. As an American in Europe, I'm sensitive about looking like a slob, and we basically had no other choice for our first night in town.

Pros: 1. Rick Steve's never steers us wrong. Great location, you can walk everywhere, even the train station which we did (all downhill there, but beware, what goes down must go up). Great restaurants close by, shopping, can't get a better hotel for the price and location in Madrid. 2. Nice, clean rooms and large bathrooms with a tub. TV had a few English channels so we could have something on in the background we could understand while in the room. 3. We flew into Madrid and just got a taxi to the hotel, it was around 30 euros and totally worth it. The drive was about 20 minutes. There is also a taxi stop right around the corner from the hotel which is very convenient. 4. Jim. Look no further if you are from the states. He is super helpful and always has a smile as well as great suggestions for eating out. 5. They kept our extra bag for us for the week and then when we got there the night before our flight out the bag was sitting in the room for us! Perfect. Cons: 1. Our flight was delayed out of Chicago therefore missing our connection to Madrid in Philly. So we were not able to get to Madrid until the next day. I emailed Hotel Europa explaining the problem and asked if we could NOT be charged for the 19th. Of course we didn't have a 24 hour notice so they did charge us. Fortunately we had trip insurance and are hoping to get refunded for that amount. Just be aware of the cancellation policy. 2.

The hotel cafeteria made a good breakfast choice, with the usual package continental breakfast but lots of other items available. Our problem is with the billing. There was a 2 Euro/day charge for the room safe, but OK, the room rate was reasonable even so. However, when we checked out, the bill was presented in dollars at a rate that was marked up 3% higher than the going exchange rate for that date. I questioned this, because we have discovered over time that we get the best possible rate when our credit card bank does it at their end, and was told it was \"automatic.\" At the time, we were in a rush to catch a train, so that was that. I don't know who is pocketing the extra money, but over several days and several hundred dollars, it adds up.

Our first trip to Madrid. The hotel is great quality at a great price in the heart of Madrid next to the Plaza del Sol. The main door to the hotel is on Calle Carmen, a street only for walking...no cars. We had a room for three which was very large. Two twin beds and one queen/full size. The bathroom was large and well appointed. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. Each day when we returned the room was cleaned very well. The floors are wood laminate and the bath is marble which helps keep the room feeling clean and comfortable. The beds were comfortable. The staff was very helpful with ideas and recommendations. Our room was on the third floor overlooking Calle Carmen. We had two balconies. The only draw back, is the noise from the street can invade the room. Saturday night was a large festival so people were out to the wee hours of the morning and when groups passed, especially larger groups of young people, the shouting and noise could be heard. My family and I are fairly heavy sleepers so this really wasn't much of a problem but if we could hear it, any light sleeper could find this a problem. Again, we were on the lower floors so I would not let that dissuade you from staying. Request an inside room or a room on an upper floor. For the price and location however, this was a very good experience.....and we tend to be picky about the hotels we stay at. The cafe, Hotel Europa was also good for breakfast or a quick snack and the outdoor cafe was good for people watching. Internet was available in the lobby. Wi-Fi would be a nice addition. A 2 euro a day charge was added to the bill for the use of the safe. It would seem they would work that into their price and not nickel and dime the customers. Finally, the hotel requires guests to turn in their room key card when they leave for the day and it is handed back when you arrive later. This seemed to be an odd practice but we put our valuables in the safe just to be sure.

If you want a break from restaurant food, Corte Ingles is just down the street. The bottom floor is a very nice supermarket. You can pick up some bread, cheese and fruit for an inexpensive meal.

It's in the heart of everything, right on Puerto del Sol which is unfortunately under construction and behind ugly blue temporary walls. Major streets radiate from Puerto del Sol to every corner of the city and there's a subway stop steps away from Hotel Europa if you're inclined to ride (which I did to the airport for 2E). Less than 5 minutes on foot there's a wide variety of restaurants and stores including Cortes Ingles which has a food market in its lowest level if you opt to picnic. Front desk very friendly when I checked in. The man who took my bags up to my room was especially friendly, warm and welcoming. Later in my visit I had questions and the front desk was busy, and while they answered my questions, well, let's say they're not the best multi-taskers. Comment based on earlier review on this site: I kept my keycard with me even even though they ask you to turn it in for them to keep and no one said a word. Two free computers in the lobby were available most times I wanted them and most guests were respectful of the 15 minute time limit per-use time request. Room comfortable and clean; bigger than most in Europe for the price. I left for breakfast at 8 am and upon return, my room was made up. Bathroom modern, large and sparkling. When I reserved I asked for, and got, a non-smoking interior room which had French doors opening to a courtyard. Nice and quiet. Geraniums bloomed in window boxes outside every room.. Courtyard had plastic roof that let in a lot of sun; when it rained I opened the doors for a cool breeze and nothing inside got wet. I ate breakfast at the attached restaurant; waiters were friendly and tolerant of my horrendous attempts at Spanish. I spent time reading at my table and was never rushed. There are non-smoking tables inside immediately to left as you enter restaurant's front doors. I'm a solo traveler and conscious about security.

A band plays out at night in front of the hotel (there is a hotel restaurant attached) so it can be really noisy on the street in front but the windows are double paned (we had french doors) so the soundproofing is alright. Fun to watch the band from the windows if you get a room in the front. Room is roomy by european standards; bathroom was quite nice.

(Don't visit Spain without reading this book prior). We book the Hotel Europa via the hotel web site and asked for a room on a top floor. Our arrival in Madrid (from Philadelphia) and trip via taxi was effortless and the taxi dropped us 5 feet from the front door. Upon arrival our bags were whisked out of the taxi and, as were were checking in early, the bags were stored securely until later in the day. We immediately booked a bus tour and returned to the hotel later in the afternoon. Our room was 'squeaky' clean and overlooked the plaza. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was a good size, and everything about the room satisfied weary travelers. (we made an excellent choice in booking Hotel Europa) NOTE: even the hallways were impressive; the rugs were spotless and the marble walls were something not seen in most American hotels ~ very nice. The front desk staff was very professional, efficient and courteous. Most of our questions were handled by 'Javier' who was very professional and assisted us in tour arrangements. We ate at the hotel sidewalk cafe and were most impressed. YOU\"VE GOT TO EAT and drink HERE! A pitcher of sangria, a plate of ham & cheese, and of course the bread. Scrumptious! And the sidewalk musicians were great also. We had no difficulties with street noise even though our room overlooked the square; the windows (when closed) block out virtually all noise. The hotel location is center to many activities most tourists look for; shopping, restaurants, nightlife, access to tour busses, etc. Perfect!

The staff were helpful, there is a PC available in the reception area for internet access. This was often busy, but we just hopped on if it happened to be free as we were passing through. Pretty much everything we wanted to see in Madrid was within walking distance of this hotel. Plaza Mayor is only five minutes walk away (at a leisurely pace), the palace is around 10 minutes walk, Gran Via is about 5 mins, Plaze De Espana about 10 mins, Retiro Park is about 20 mins. The hotel is incredibly easy to find, you just take the Metro to Sol, go to the Calle de Carmen exit and look for the statue of the bear. The only negative thing I can think of is that night times could be very noisy, as street performers sometimes gather at the bear and can play until well past midnight - so it may not be right if you like early nights.

This however is NOT a drawback as their rates are well below the average. Like most reviewers, we found our six nights spent in a clean, modern hotel, well run and friendly. The bathroom in particular was new. Location is in the very center of Madrid, indeed, in the very center of Spain. Restaurants, shops, Metro, sights, museums are all within easy walking distance. The room came with cable TV and free Internet access via a cable (wireless and a laptop are also free in the lobby). Three things detracted from our comfort: We had a larger room facing the Puerta del Sol and noise was a problem from street musicians despite the soundproof (almost) glass windows. The music ends at 11 PM but be prepared to be serenaded until then. A smaller room facing away from the square would be the only remedy. The mattress on the bed was so hard and unsupportive we both had back pains each morning. Nothing chronic, they went away, but be aware. While there was more than enough space in our room, only straight backed desk chairs were provided. No sofa or easy chair were available at the end of a busy day.

However, the windows had double-paned glass, and I usually could not hear the crowd noise above the air conditioner. The room had contemporary furnishings, and everything was clean and in good condition. The room had plenty of space. In addition to the internet available on a public computer in the lobby, my room had an ethernet connection. You need to have your own CAT5 cable.

I lost my wallet on the Metro between Barajas and the hotel. The staff was understanding and helpful. They provided the toll-free numbers for VISA and MasterCard, and they let me stay even though I did not get a replacement credit card until the last day. So what did I not like? The room did not have a refrigerator or a minibar. The first few days, I noticed a slightly soapy smell from the sheets and also in the hallways. I don't know if they started rinsing better, or if my nose got desensitized, but I did not notice the smell after a couple days. The one thing I really did not like was the tiny shower. The inside was only about two feet square (60cm x 60cm), and there was no soap dish or any place to put the soap, shampoo, etc. The plumbing was mounted on the center of the wall, and protruded about 6 inches (15cm) into the shower, encroaching into the precious space. I found it impossible to move around without accidentally hitting the valve and either shutting off the water or changing its temperature; it would have been much better if they had installed the plumbing and controls in the corner, or made the space in the shower a little larger.", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGood location, good price, good hotel\u201d", "Author": "fco", "ReviewID": "UR15044330", "Content": "Spent 4 March days in cool but sunny Madrid.

We walked everywhere from our hotel, to the museums (Reina Sofia, Prado, Real Jardin) to the tapas bars and San Gines Chocolateria.

We got off from Callao station rather than Sol, so it was a bit of walk for us to get to the hotel, but it is actually only a few steps away from Sol station, so make sure you get off from Sol. Our room was very clean with wooden floor, beds made daily. Our room had 2 windows that opened to 2 balconies overseeing Calle de Carmen, where the city center is. Street noise was not an issue, however, there were loud door closing from inconsiderate neighbors. Right next to the hotel, there is a Tapas bar, the bartenders are hospitable. They did not treat us like tourist. My brother had the snails and I had a small beer. If you like arroz dishes, you should definitely try Restaurante La Barraca (Calle Reina, 29) or Restaurante de Reina (calle Reina,39), they are both on Calle de la Reina, 1 street over from and parallel to Gran Via. Try paella negro con gamgas, appetizers, sangria... I highly recommend them. Our bills came out to be less than 100 euros for 3 people for both places, it was with either wine or sangria, appetizers, soups, try Castilan Soup at La Barraca.

Our flight left at 7:15, and the Madrid metro doesn't begin daily service until 6:00. We ended up staying the night in the airport.

It is worth mentioning that if you're unfamiliar with the area, you might have a little bit of trouble finding the hotel after being dropped off by the cab driver (who's most likely not able to converse in English) for a short walk. Please note that the taxi can NOT stop right in front of the hotel so a little bit of walking is required. I would suggest that you bring a suitcase that have wheels.

However, if you require peace and quiet, this is not the hotel for you, as it could get pretty loud particularly on Friday and Saturday nights with the noise continuing till dawn.

I always like to take a nice hot shower in a spacious & comfortable bathroom, which I got at this hotel. It's located in the center-center of the city, very convenient for sightseeing and getting on the Metro. The area around the hotel is always full of people (except for early in the morning) and you can get the feel of Madrid. I knew from (thanks to) other people's review that the hotel was undergoing renovation. I didn't ask for it when I made reservations directly with the hotel but we did get one of the renovated rooms so it was very nice and clean with a tiny balcony. The noise from the outside didn't bother us but sometimes we heard a kind of gurgle noise probably from the other rooms (maybe someone flushing the toilet or using the shower, I'm not sure). I was a bit surprised when I first heard the noise but it was just once in a while and it didn't bother us much. The lobby was going through some construction but we didn't hear anything from our room although our room was just 1 floor above. We didn't have any trouble with the airconditioning, probably because we stayed towards the end of October. Not too cold nor hot, so we didn't have to bother with it. Breakfast was not included but there's a cafe next door. The price ranged from 2.40 (coffee & toast) to 10.00 euros depending on how much you want to eat! Other things I liked and that was helpful about the hotel was that all 3 people I met at the reception spoke English and there's a shuttle service to the airport (I believe several euros cheaper than taking a cab). In some of the websites I saw the hotel is rated 1 star but I found in one of the guidebooks I bought it is rated 3 stars. I don't know how they rate hotels and which is true but if you consider the location, price, cleanliness and comfort of the room and bathroom, I think it's worth staying here.", "Date": "October 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bustervi", "Title": "\u201cVery Clean and In a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "bustervi", "ReviewID": "UR6018832", "Content": "We asked for room that was quiet considering that there is construction at the Puerta del Sol.

As mentioned by other reviews the Plaza del Sol is under construction and the hotel lobby is being done up but this was not a problem and didn\u2019t affect our stay at all. We only spent about five minutes in the lobby checking in and out. All our rooms were spotless, spacious, bright and modern, had air conditioning and very effective double glazing which completely blocked out the noise (and it was very noisy in the square below!). Rooms on the outside had a small balcony. The staff were helpful and efficient and took care of the check-in, shuttle bus and bag storage etc without fuss. The hotel is in walking distance of Plaza Mayor and the Royal Palace. The Prado and the Retiro park are a slightly further walk or four stops from the nearby Metro for a euro. (The Retiro is definitely worth a visit on a sunny Sunday afternoon). There are lots of bars, restaurants and shops close by. The Europa Restaurant and bar next door is in a pedestrian area, has chairs and tables outside and is a good meeting point.

As I dropped my wife and son off to find parking I had a horrible feeling that we were going to have to cancel our reservation and hoof it to find another place. I told my wife to check out the room while I parked. As I walked back to the hotel my wife and son were smillingly calling to me from a balcony on the third floor telling me the room was perfect - which it was when I got to it. The hotel is definitely undergoing renovations, but they seemed to have completed the rooms and are just working on the lobby, entrance and adjacent restaurant. These are the most spacious rooms we've had on our trip. Comfortable beds, large, clean baths with showers, satellite TV, and Internet (bring your own network cable to plug in). You are steps from the Puerta del Sol and all the major shopping stores in Madrid. Halfway between the Prado and the Royal Palace, this is a perfect location for enjoying Madrid on foot. We were not told to expect breakfast in the 120 euro price, so I didn't notice the lack of the restaurant as others said. I didn't even realize the restaurant was mentioned highly in other travel guides until we were here. There is no shortage of restaurants of all kinds within easy walking distance. Even my first glimpse of a European Dunkin' Donuts! The only drawback I'd note is that the excellent map on their website can be a bit misleading. Directions are accurate, but the side streets they indicate to the hotel are pedestrian roads. You can drive down them to deliver passengers and luggage without any problem from the locals (though you do get funny looks from the other tourists!) I highly recommend this hotel for the rooms and quiet atmosphere in a bustling part of Madrid. If you judge a hotel by the lobby this may not be the place for you, but for all the rest it's great.

The hotel is right on PLaza del Sol, and very near to PLaza Mayor, the area is very safe and great for going out at night. As the area is buzzing at night there is a lot of street noise- mainly people chatting, but the rooms are insulated enough to exclude most noise. It's also right beside the subway station. Some people may be disappointed with the entrance lobby - it is a tad shabby compared to the rooms. But don't judge a book by it's cover, the rooms are recently renovated and it's nice to see that the money was spent on the rooms rather than the lobby where you don't spend any time.
