I don't even know where to begin listing the things wrong with this hotel. I guess I'll start by saying that I'm not sure it's even a hotel. It's on the fifth floor of a dirty old building with an antique, rickety elevator. You don't even get to keep your own room key - you have to turn it in to the watchman everytime you leave the hotel. And you have to be buzzed back in when you return. The owners of this hotel are extremely rude - forget about being helpful or friendly. The cleaning woman seemed to hate her job. She was always running around like we were in the way and made us feel guilty for eating the breakfast they provide (because she had to stop cleaning to make it - just left the cleaning materials sit there in the hallway and started getting the food). The breakfast is a hard roll, some plastic-wrapped pieces of bread and jam and coffee. One evening we wanted to enjoy some coffee on the terrace and we had our own instant packets and asked the male owner for some hot water. He responded, \"There is no hot water.\" And we asked, can you turn on the coffee machine or do you have a microwave? He said, \"We do not live here!\" and said something (rude, I assume) in Italian. And the bathroom! Ugh. The bed was bad enough -- nasty blankets, broken frame -- but the bathroom was not cleaned once during our stay. I venture to say it wasn't cleaned before our stay either because there were \"short hairs\" int he bidet the first day we arrived. And they remained the whole time. Rust spots in the corners of the shower, dingy feeling, ratty towels - you name it, this \"hotel\" has it. My husband and I look back and laugh now, but for honeymooners - or really anyone expecting a decent place to stay - this hotel could RUIN your stay in Rome. I consider this \"hotel\" a scam. There looked to be some better places on Via Cernaia and on the Termini side of Via Masala.

What a terrible mistake... Better start off with the positives - the location is really good. 5 min walk to the train station (to catch tourist buses, airport shuttles, shops + supermarkets), few good resteraunts around, and ONE staff member pleasant and helpful. Free wi-fi. We also didn't catch anything. Those in no way out-weigh the negatives of this truly awful hotel. It is on the fifth floor accessed by the scariest and oldest lift I have ever been in, and even during our short stay it broke down, meaning my elderly parents had to carry large suitcases down flights of stairs. The floor was so dirty when I made the mistake of walking barefoot in the room one day my feet turned BLACK. My partner went for a shower on the afternoon we checked in and found a pair of old, wet, UNDERWEAR in the shower cubicle, obviously left by the previous tennant, which leads you to believe no cleaning staff had been there either. No cleaning was done the entire time we were there (3 nights), no towels changed (including the filthy dish-rag they called a bath mat). The bathrooms of both our room and my parent's room were tiny and smelt extremely bad, there are obviously problems with the plumbing. Air conditioning was an extra 8 euro a day. And the icing on the cake...The notice in our room specified a noon checkout, as did the site we booked through. On the day we left, since we had an afternoon flight and had seen all we could of Rome, we decided to spend our morning packing and sending some emails in the room before leaving shortly before 12pm. At 11.20 we had a knock on the door, and the abrupt woman (think the owner) yelled that we had to leave as she had to clean it (ha!) because people were arriving in 15mins. We were put out but willing to oblige, so as soon as we could made our way out. The elderly man on reception then tsk-ed us and said \"very bad people, very bad\". I explained that we had thought check-out was 12, at which point he started to yell at us rudely in Italian, interspersed with \"bad people\". So shocked I was close to tears, we promised him we would write this experience up for others to share. And so we have.

We had a boring, identical breakfast served every single morning - a hard bread roll, a sweeter (croissant type) bun, one portion of strawberry jam and butter were optional, plus tea or coffee. Zwieback in cellophane packs were available too. Really.....couldn't there be some variety?!! Maybe a glass of juice or a piece of fruit, or a yogurt, for example.

The lobby area was also locked. When I was buzzed in, I noticed it was dark with all sorts of odd photos and decorations. To get to my room, I had to climb an additional flight of steps. The room itself was simply furnished but clean. The bathroom had hairs on the wall and the shower head was covered in lime. Also, the shower head was simply mounted to the wall with a drain in the floor. Water sprayed all over the bathroom. When I left the next morning, the desk clerk was asleep on the sofa in what I assume was the breakfast area. I let myself out and left the key on the desk. It was a bargain for Rome at $80 a night.

The shower leaked, which wasn't the end of the world, but the bath towel left in the bathroom to mop up the overflow was nearly black- it had obviously been used for that purpose for a long time and was never changed while we were there. The toilet had some problems flushing, as we discovered the first night of our stay- we were treated to the view of someone's used condom which remained floating in the toilet until the next day, despite repeated flushing. We spent as little time as possible at this hotel, and really wished we had somewhere else to stay.

I have been sending friends there ever since! Where to begin.... Salvatore....Salvatore...Salvatore. He's the Son of the owners and runs the hotel. Well, did when I was there. Nicest guy, let me tell you. Speaks perfect English too. As soon as I checked in, Salvatore offered me a cappuccino. Nice..... And, by far, the best damn cappuccino I had in Rome! I mean it's the personal touches, the little things, that make the day a wee bit brighter, Si? I had two rooms there. The first was just down the hall from the front desk. I liked this room: simple and comfortable. Air conditioned too. I left the hotel and came back from traveling, and was given room number 19 - a great single on the upper floor. It didn't have the bidet and better shower my other room had, but it had a tiny balcony and it was nice to be a bit removed from the entrance. Ok. My only gripe is the PILLOWS! Mama Mia.... note to self: send Salvatore some comfortable pillows! Like sleeping on a bag of socks. Interesting to say the least. The breakfast was simple, but this is the way Italians eat for those nagging to complain for no reason. The bread was good, the coffee was as well, and it was nice to sit outside on the terrace and watch the windows opening of the people who lived across the way, as if taking a peek at a drive in movie without paying... A slice of daily life in Rome.... Bella. Everyone was incredibly nice to me. I was traveling alone and I felt entirely comfortable staying there and in the area in general. The proximity to Termini station can't be beat! And, there's a great little restaurant just around the corner that gets packed in the evenings and is exceptionally good and CHEAP. It's called \"Ristorante La Famiglia\". Ask anyone in the area, they all go there. Try the Carbonara and you'll know why fattening things are just meant to be SAVORED.... I'll be staying there again this fall. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And, the Domus Mea is pure Kitsch with a whole lot of heart. It's good as gold as is.
