It was in a residential area of Berlin in a quiet neighborhood, and within a 15-20 minute walk of the train station. The close proximity to local eating establishments was also good, and we were able to sample an authentic local taste in atmosphere. It will help you if you know a little German to interact with the hotel staff, but we managed without too much difficulty. Our room was spacious and roomy, with plenty of room to relax and unwind from a long day.

Our triple room was very spacious: it actually had a separate room for the 3rd bed, high ceilings, very tall windows, airy, extremely clean, very nicely decorated. The bathroom was a little small but it served its purpose. We really enjoyed our stay and the gracious host Susanne made sure my kids had everyting they needed. The gentleman who checked us in did not speak any English but we managed to understand each other. This lovely hotel is very close to the centre of the cityand very well connected to the rest of Berlin as the S-Bahn stop (Savignyplatz) is just around the corner from the hotel. Breakfast is to be paid on the side (7 euros per person), but they did not charge my 2 year old and it had a good selection. We will definately go back!", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cSweet little pension\u201d", "Author": "Foca_Blanca", "ReviewID": "UR14990758", "Content": "Nice little B&B with good location and peaceful neighbourhood.
