Check in took forever, even though it was not a busy time. We were assigned adjoining rooms. But on seeing that one of the rooms had a connecting door, we asked if we could change one of the rooms to the connected room. Staff was extremely rude and condescending. Rooms were very small, but clean. But no toiletries except for a hanging shampoo / showergel. Kind of what you get in a budget hotel, disappointing. Rooms not made the next day by 3pm until we called the room service to request for it. Breakfast was very simple, and did not have an omelet station even for that price. Hotel also quite a walk from the MTR, through backlanes. Not a pleasant walk. There is a moneychanger and a 7-11 nearby, but not much else. No pool for kids also. Not impressed with hotel in general, but i guess that could be the after taste from the bad check-in experience.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201cA nice place for aother stay\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR139870183", "Content": "Except that you need walk about 10 minutes from subway, the hotel is perfect for the short economic stay. \u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u7ed9\u8fd9\u4e2aIBIS\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002 \u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u6bcf\u5e74\u4f1a\u53bb\u9999\u6e2f\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u516c\u5dee\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7f8e\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u662f\u5f88\u5173\u952e\u3002\u800c\u9999\u6e2f\u623f\u4ef7\u9887\u9ad8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9152\u5e97\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\u3002 \u9664\u4e86\u6709\u70b9\u8fdc\uff0c\u79bb\u4e0a\u73af\u8981\u8d70\u4e0a10\u5206\u949f\u5916\uff0c\u9152\u5e97\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u623f\u95f4\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u4e5f\u7b97\u5b89\u9759\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u623f\u95f4\u9762\u79ef\u4e0d\u5c0f\u3002\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u9152\u5e97\u53ea\u80fd\u8f6c\u4e2a\u8eab\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u670d\u52a1\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6211\u8ba2\u623f\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u548c\u62a4\u7167\u6709\u4e9b\u51fa\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u524d\u53f0\u5f88\u8010\u5fc3\u7684\u7ed9\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u3002 \u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u4ef7\u683c\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5962\u671b\u8c6a\u534e\u3002", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lucknow, India", "Title": "\u201cIbis HongKong Central and Sheung Wan..a nice experience\u201d", "Author": "sangeetasrivastava", "ReviewID": "UR139703009", "Content": "A good budget hotel. We decided to stay at this new hotel for 4 nights to get experience staying on Hongkong Island. This hotel is comparatively cheap & availability of rooms is plenty. Pay more if you want a harbour view. The hotel is good and also very clean as this hotel is still new. Our stay there was almost very good. Huge nice lifts are there. Although the check in time is 2:00 pm, but we reached early around 9 am as our flight was early, the reception staff allowed us to check in. This was a big relief. They have good luggage storage facility also. The staff is nice and gentle, ready to help you. They hold HKD 1000 as security money which is not mentioned while booking is made. The most amazing thing is free Wi-Fi and the signals are very strong. Location is fine. Breakfast is a bit too expensive. However, in nearby area, there are a lot of small and big restaurant. The problem is that the menu card is not in english and only for a few dishes you get an english translation. The same problem is with taxis. The drivers dont know english so you have to carry the name of your destination in Cantonese language. The service in hotel is fairly good. The tea-coffee facility is there but only once a day. If you require extra tea bags or creamers or spoons, they will not supply and tell that you have already been given your share. In the vicinity of the hotel, there are many super stores open till late night, so we used to by tea bags and milk from the market. The most disappointing thing about this hotel is that no tour operator picks you up from this hotel. The hotel has a travel desk of Vigour Travels with a nice gentleman sitting over there. But he is helpless as for any tour, you either go to Novatel or Cosmopolitan or Parkland or Central pier No. 6 or 9...or so and they will drop you there. You take a taxi and come back to Ibis by yourself. The nightmare starts when none of the taxis would stop for you, and if stop by chance, will refuse you to go to IBIS, Sheung Wan. We were stuck in the middle of the way for half an hour, when courtesy of another hotel staff that saw us running from pillar to post to get a taxi, called us to their entrance and helped us board a taxi back to our hotel. So I would like to advise the hotel staff to arrange pick and drop facility from their hotel for the tourists. The hotel's reception is on 5th floor, but travel desk on ground floor. So if you have to wait, keep on standing as there are no sitting facilities like other hotels which have lounge with plush sofa sets or chairs. We waited for more than 30-40 minutes to catch their Airport Shuttle for Airport as it was late, but there was no place to sit. The hotel staff was however very helpful saying that bus would come in another 10 minutes to console us.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR139653055", "Content": "The MTR is far from the hotel, 15 minutes walking.

The Hotel location is particularly good if the intention is to catch a ferry to Macau being s close to the Macau ferry terminal. I arrived quite late in the evening but check in, which was on the 5th floor, was reasonably efficient. The Starbucks on the ground floor had not opened and you have to take the side street next to Starbucks to get into the Hotel. Having said that, there was a staff on the Ground floor who directs you to the lifts. Room was typical Ibis, clean and efficient although I was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary slippers and fridge. Bathroom is small but shower pressure is good and layout is functional although no bath tub. Noted earlier complaints about cleanliness but I had no such issue. Generally a typical Ibis although they do surprise every so often. Most of the guests at the Hotel were tour groups from mainland China and I can see this being a popular Hotel for them.

I never been asked about my bed preference/request when I stayed with any other Accor Group Hotels even when I was travelling by myself. If I was going to put my partner on different bed or another room then I would put that request through when I was making the booking. But overall this hotel is good and also very clean as this hotel is still new and bathroom size is good for Ibis standard. Breakfast is good for Ibis standard but little bit too expensive for what you get. I hardly can't sleep because my bed was very hard (maybe because it is still new?) and if you don't like staying in the hotel that you must transfer to another lift to get to your room from ground floor then this hotel may not be your right choice.

The staff said this is because the hotel is newly opened and not yet received licensing to accept American Express. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t mentioned on the website when booking. I had no other credit card with me and had to leave cash payment for the room and deposit. This was a bit embarrassing and luckily I had enough cash with me. While I was checking-out, there was a guest checking-in that was in the same situation. Unfortunately he had no other credit card or enough cash. The staff asked him to go to the ATM to withdraw cash for the deposit. For a major international chain hotel to not be able to accept American Express is really not acceptable. -- The hotel is well situated in the western area of Sheung Wan. It is within 5 minutes drive from the Hong Kong Airport Express Station and within walking distance to the Sheung Wan MTR station. Trams and many buses stop just outside the hotel. The main entrance to the hotel is actually on West Bonham Strand not Des Voeux Road West (the Des Voeux Road West entrance was closed and there was sigh directing guests around the corner to the main entrance). The lobby is on the fifth floor and a staff was in place on the ground floor to direct guests there. Check-in was quick and easy (except for the American Express problem) and staff provided the password for free wifi access (in-room and all public areas). The hotel is brand new and the public areas (lobby, hallways, etc.) are in great condition and stylishly decorated. The room was a typical Ibis room (neat, functional, with the basic necessities). However, some extras were provided that I haven\u2019t seen at all Ibis hotels, such as slippers, complimentary bottled water and a small refrigerator in the room. There was small in-room safe for valuables. Local and international TV channels (30) were available, offering programming in Chinese, English and French. The adjustable air conditioning worked very well and the room cooled off quickly upon arrival and remained comfortable throughout the stay. Everything in the room was new and in excellent condition. Unfortunately, it seems housekeeping is not very thorough. There were fingerprints and smudges on the desk, and mirrors in the main room and bathroom. Also, the toilet flush handle was dirty (yuck!) and there was a brown drip/stain on the bathroom door. Other than these issues, the room seemed clean overall. I was woken up by the noise of other guests very early in the morning and again by housekeeping in the hallway. The door/entrance to the room could definitely use some soundproofing. When checking out at noon, the front desk was fairly busy with other guests checking in and out (with some occupying the lobby seating with a lot of baggage, presumably waiting for their rooms to become available). The check-out process was fairly quick, though delayed a bit while the staff assisting me (possibly the supervisor/manager) left to deal with the other guest who\u2019s American Express card couldn\u2019t be accepted. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for it\u2019s location and value. The housekeeping needs to be improved (somewhat forgivable due to it being a new hotel, new staff, etc.) and I assume they will have their licensing to accept American Express in the near future.
