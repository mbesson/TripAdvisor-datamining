{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent Stayed for four nights (split in two stays as I had another business trip) as part of a business trip. I had been to Akasaka before and I had noticed this new hotel with its stunning metal-decorated facade.The Centurion offers western-style accomodation with a touch of design which would probably classify it as a boutique hotel in Europe. It is however far from being impersonal and retains a distinct Japanese elements in some of its decoration (not least the small shoe cubboard at its entrance inviting you to remove your shoes before stepping onto the wooden flooring). Its concept is in-between hotel and apartments, so rooms are spacious, even by European standards, and they include a washing machine (the command panel being entirely in Japanese however, like all the in-room instructions and documentation) and a small kitchen area. Other amenities include remote-controlled heating/air conditioning and Flat screen TV. There is no in-room minibar but a fridge and there is a vending machine (soft drinks, energy drinks and beer) on the 6th floor. Modern bathroom even by Japanese standards with one of the best showers I have tested recently (with multiple options controlled by LCD panel). The bed quality is above average and guarantees a good night sleep - although streets can be noisy at times, since this is a nightlife district as well.On our second stay we were offered a top floor room which included a small terrace facing an inside mid-floor patio, yet large enough (I'd say 9 sq. m.) to accomodate two deckchairs, a real treat in Tokyo. Staff extremely helpful, efficient and courteous as expected in Japan, although on our first check-in they were not too flexible on checking-in times, probably because of the limited number of rooms. On check out the duty managers did not spare his efforts to get us a taxi on a Sunday morning and went in person to the taxi rank. Please beware that at some hours (around lunchtime) streets may be closed and your taxi would have to drop you within 100m of the hotel - you have to know the location if you do not want to wander in the small streets. Also, it is advisable to print an access map to give to the taxi when coming from the station. The area is upmarket and at night becomes a nightlife district, mostly Japanese despite a couple of western-style pubs (this is not Roppongi). As usual this means plenty of restaurants (including a fugu restaurant and an excellent and very popular sushi bar), a couple of pachinko parlours, western-style wine bars, an Oyster bar and a number of clubs which, from their name and location on the building floors, sound like gentlemen's club (the typical Japanese ones catering for businessmen, which would explain the number of chauffered limos parked at night - so you, especially as a westerner, won't be touted in, as you would in other areas like Roppongi). There are plenty of convenience stores nearby as well as a 24-hours McDonald (I'm not recommending it, just trying to be helpful).Adjacent to the hotel is a Korean restaurant (presenting itself as Yakiniku but serving mixed/fusion cuisine with Korean dishes as well, including, yes, kimchi) which is absolutely fantastic and highly recommended (two dine for Y8,000 with drinks).Overall, an excellent hotel in a vibrant location, still at a reasonable price (Y23,000 per night) - we felt very welcome and I would particularly recommend it for seasoned travellers and those who love Japan.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR961605786", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MCMember"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d1105485-r22534607-Centurion_Hotel_Residential_Akasaka-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1105485", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
