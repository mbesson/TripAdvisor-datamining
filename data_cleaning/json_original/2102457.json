Since over 20 years we go at least once a year to this vibrant and stimulating city, but we never found a \"preferred hotel\", so we tried a lot of \"upper-bracket\" lodgings. Palace, Meridien, Omm, Grand Florida, Arts, Abac to just cite a few. The only one which came close to the Alma was Abac, a much smaller charming newcomer with a fabulous restaurant, but without the location. The Alma is right spot on where you want to be based (Mallorca and Passeig de Gracia). Very nice rooms and bathrooms, comfortable bedding, good tech equipment like reliable and free wi-fi (when will luxury hotels finally understand that a free wi-fi is part of a modern hotels basic equpment???, look at Alma as an example please), spectacular and pleasing modern design, which works and \"cool\" foyer, restaurant, bar, terrace et al. But what puts this hotel in a different category is it's employees. A smile on their lips at all times, really helpful, eager to please and competent. Particular mention for the ladies and gentlemen of the reception staff who function as hosts, concierges and friends in the same time and really find the right balance between friendliness and efficiency. There are a lot of \"design hotels\" in Barcelona which exude hipness and a cool attitude, but the coolness also comes with a cool reception towards their guests and a lack of hospitality which by experience permeates the entire hotel and restaurant industry in Barcelona. Thank you for changing this and be sure that next time we are in Barcelona we shall come back to our new favorite hotel. Let me mention as well that during our stay the hotel was fully booked and that at no time this has diminished the quality of the service or the helpfulness of the staff.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolverhampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "holidaylicous", "ReviewID": "UR128213142", "Content": "My Husband and I stayed here on the 25th March for three nights.

But it was tolerable. The heating(digital panel for temp.choice) is controlled by the individual in the room. Great. One issue which was annoying was carrying a great wooden keychain around with me as the \"fingerprint\" door key didn't work for me. I was told that I must have dry skin(??) How my skin could have dried up between reception ( where it worked as I registered on check in) and my room on the 3rd floor, I do not know. I felt so stupified by the receptionist's reasoning I agreed with her! Hence the big key. The room service has a very limited menu so don't get all comfortable to eat in your room. Not worth it. However, the food downstairs in the bar/lounge/dining (understated chic/modern with floor to ceiling windows onto the deck/garden area along the length of the room) was just superb, with a great selection of modern dishes and traditional flavours. The service was polite and without fault. There is no tea/cofee making facilities in the room ( I am a yorkshire tea addict) but one call to reception and I had a brand new kettle, tea, sugar and beautiful tea cup and saucer; and milk ( which you can store in the room's mini bar(contains non alcoholic drinks only). One other gripe would be the lack of pay on demand in -house movies to watch. I was left scanning a thousand channels to find something to watch. It would have been great to watch a film as the screen is sleek and flat on the wall opposite the bed. If I were to stay again, I 'd take some DVD's to play on my laptop, and try to book up a facial/pedicure/back massage \"before\" arriving! The prices didn't seem that bad either. All in all, much much better than most hotels I've stayed in for the price ( I chose the grand deluxe room overlooking the inner courtyard), and as someone who suffers from dust allergies, this place was heaven, with wood, leather, and marble. Not a carpet in sight. Just warm wood floors, wood floor to ceiling sliding shutters across the windows instead of curtains, and \"proper\" heavy wooden doors. Enjoy! and very well situated in up town Barcelona. P.S. For anyone using clinic Eugin (My husband and I are doing IVF with clinic Eugin and I was staying overnight alone.I was returning to receive the transer of our \"babies\". I was able to get a taxi to the clinic(the receptionist booked one for me as I had to be at the clinic very early) and it cost was \u20ac8 and about 10 mins.

We stayed here for our tenth wedding anniversary January 19th - 22nd. Not too far away from anything, yet far enough away to be isolated from the hustle and bustle of some of the more touristy areas, and yes, there is a certain amount of \"style over substance\" to this hotel, but we absolutely loved it. They were kind enough to upgrade us to a deluxe suite, but even without this kindness we would almost certainly stay here again. The rooms are very minimilist as previously noted in other comments, the lighting is subdued to say the least but there is just enough. The reading lights are very small and direct, but adjustable so one can read whilst your parner is not disturbed by the light. We thought the beds were extremely comfortable, and extra pillows were bought immediately without any undue fuss. The bathrooms are outstanding. Bulgari accessories and the most fantastic wetroom with rain shower and a bath that you could almost swim lengths in. The gym/pool floor was open. Not the most oustanding array of equipment and the pool is shallow but certainly enough to get a quick workthrough of a morning and get you going. We walked absolutely miles anyway - so if you're not getting enough excersise you may possibly be in the wrong city.The steam room was lovely but the sauna not working, you may have to ask them to switch it on, we didn't try. We didn't eat anything here - partly due to the reviews on here regarding breakfast but also because we are fairly early starters and would wander around for a good hour or so in the morning before finding somewhere to grab coffee and croissants - there is no shortage of places to do this - and evenings were taken care of by going to certain restaurants that we had researched and wanted to try in advance. We did have late night drinkies in some good company in the bar though. Ouch. Many thanks here to Nuria and Miquel on the front desk, the service from these two is superb. From hypo-allergenic bedding to booking (and then re-booking) restaurants that are difficult to get into - to taxis - to recommending routes to walk - anything seems to be possible for them, and not at too much trouble either. When returning to Barcelona these two would be the reason for booking The Alma again. Downsides: It IS expensive. It really needs to offer SKY, or at least more than 4 English speaking TV channels, all of which are news channels. WiFi is not good - but they make you feel most welcome toi use machines at reception for flight bookings etc etc. We would definately stay here again.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Modern Hotel (but why on earth is no clothes iron available??)\u201d", "Author": "MataiDubai", "ReviewID": "UR123401170", "Content": "Alma is in a perfect location.

The street is very quiet, however, in 50 meters there is a magnificent Passeig de Gracia, which is very wide and busy most of the time. Shoppers will like that most of the major brand stores are located exactly near the hotel on Passeig de Gracia. We used taxi extensively and found it cheap and convenient way of moving around. One has to remember to bring hotel address with them because taxi drivers are not always aware of this hotel and hotel sign is hardly recognizable. Inside the hotel: the hotel is very new and they were not saving on small detail when building it. For the first time we saw finger print access system to our room. Very convenient as you do not have to carry any key. As long as you do not forget to have you hand with you and still remember, which finger did you use initially at check-in you will get into your room with no trouble. The interior is rich with use of wooden panels, metal, and leather, but is not posh or trying to impress sacrificing usability. It is a very convenient place. We can name only one detail, which we did not like. Apparently designers of the hotel think that bathroom should not have any doors and can be an extension to the room corridor\u2026 In December it was rather cold to take a shower in the open space. Otherwise equipment is all modern and easy to use. Reception: all our good words go to this very important part of the hotel. First of all they all speak near perfect English (a big plus in Spain!). The staff was very helpful. Their suggestions regarding going out were mostly great and we used them all the time. Breakfast: we think it is overpriced and is too big. We had it once and then always used nearby cafes. You can always (even on Dec. 25th) get you coffee and a croissant for a small price there. Other amenities: tried to use gym and spa, but to our surprise they were closed for renovation. We were disappointed that nobody informed us in advance before we went down to use them. Reception offered to jog around in Barcelona, which was an interesting experience and is worth trying, but is not a substitute. It was low season for the hotel but still such things have to be at least announced. Another issue was poor Wi-Fi connection. No matter which device we used the reception was very weak and we almost gave up using it in the room.

The beds are extremely uncomfortable and quite frankly hard, to the point where your back hurts when you awake. The pillows are also very thin and offer no neck support whatsoever. All in all, it makes for a very substandard night sleep and certainly not that of a 5 star establishment. The pool and gymnasium are currently out of action even though they're prominently advertised. Why advertise what you haven't currently got? There's also no iron and ironing board available though, you can pay 12 euros to have the hotel press 1 piece of clothing. Every hotel should have at least 1 communal iron and ironing board for guests to use. Surely this is something that could be easily and cheaply rectified. AlmaBarcelona has large rooms with an overall good design concept but the rooms are minimalist to a fault and look bare and sterile. Some magazines and / or fresh flowers would do the trick. I want a 5 star hotel to be inviting and not cold and hospital like. The service wasn't brilliant and the staff didn't seem to be knowledgeable. I asked a basic question of how to get to the Gaudi park and their response was to follow the tourist bus route. I didn't come to Barcelona to follow a tourist bus and I expect as locals, they have local knowledge that tourists don't have. There's also no concierge and nobody to open the heavy door, if they do, the staff great you with a grunt. The hotel signage is non existent to say the least. Apparently a small sign (about the size of an A4 piece of paper) above a pot plant at the front entrance of the hotel is good enough, in their opinion. AlmaBarcelona is the poorest excuse of a 5 star hotel that I've ever experienced. Never again, please don't make the same mistake as me!

Yes, we were expected to pay an additional 17 euro to access a facility that should otherwise have been part of our stay at the hotel. Not to mention no Spa or pool. I was filthy at this suggestion. They phoned me later and offered free breakfast as compensation for the fact that all of the hotels 5 star facilities were closed and that guests were not notified of this and where we were paying > 300 euro per night for our room. I had to demand (ask and ask again) that the hotel cover the cost of the gym (17 euro per person) and provide breakfast. Otherwise our stay at a 5 star, >300 euro per night hotel was a complete sham. They ultimately agreed to this. However the Hotel should have 1) advised guests that works were being undertaken; 2) been pro-active and covered the cost of providing access to other facilities (gym etc).

After mentioning a couple of restaurants we had heard from friends or online to the hotel, they said that they weren't sure what they were not up very good.

Location The hotel is extremely well located, on the northern part of Paseo de Gracia. This is a posh neighbourhood with plenty of shopping and excellent restaurants. It is however 10 mins away from Plaza Catalunya, the heart of the city and 20-25 mins from the Gothic quarter, Las Ramblas, etc. Taxis are quite cheap, we never dealt with the metro. You will almost never pay more than EUR10. Getting to the old city is around EUR5-7. The surroundings are extremely safe. Rooms Let me start by pointing out that (as others reviews have mentioned) the hotels decoration is extremely minimalistic and dark. I enjoy that a lot but my wife said she felt a little depressed which is understandable. The Grand Deluxe room we stayed in was extremely spacious and had a large window overlooking an inner courtyard (a large courtyard made of several buildings, not a small and depressing one). I loved the clutter free and functional decoration but as I said before, my spouse wasn't thrilled. The room consists of large bathroom with a good sized bath, two faucets and a huge rain shower, a separate toilet (didnt find this disturbing at all as some other reviewers did) and a spacious bedroom. The bed is extremely comfortable, there is a desk near the window, a modern LCD TV, numerous wardrobes and drawers. As I said before, everything is clutterless, functional and modern. The shades are made of wood and when they slide shut, the room is perfectly dark. Good point for late sleepers. You enter the room by touching the fingerprint reader so no need to carry a key/card around. I thought this was really cool: we didnt need to worry about whether we forgot the cards or who had them... The minibar is stocked with free soft drinks. Some might criticise the lack of variety but I thought it was good: mineral water, coca cola, fruit juices and a couple of sodas. First time I've seen a free minibar so I think thats a plus. Oh, I almost forgot the laptop sized safe which is a good bonus even when the hotel feels safe as Alma. The bathroom is extremely modern and good looking. Very large bath, huge rain shower, two faucets... Perfect. I have never experienced any of the negative drain and water in the room problems I have read in other reviews. Finally, there is free wifi in all rooms and all of the hotel but it has a tendency to disconnect you every now & then (more like 5 minutes). This was extremely annoying and I hope the hotel will review this limitation. Service Didnt use room service so I cant really comment on that. Nor did we have breakfast... A lot of nice breakfast joints in the surrounding areas, no need to pay the hotel for a continental. I have however asked for help for restaurant reservations / cancellations and asked directions. Staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about where to eat. They looked up for train sechedules, called the restaurant to let them know we would be late, etc... I think the negative reviews about service are either extremely unlucky (they probably came across the one rotten apple in the whole market) or ill minded. Conclusion This is an excellent hotel. It is extremely well located and offers fabulous service. The rooms are large and well designed but some might find the dark atmosphere a little depressing.

The only thing I didn't like was the breakfast, because if you ask the room service you can only get the standard continental breakfast. I also tried the restaurant for dinner and the food was always very fine and very well cooked, although you don't have big choice in the menu. The service was very good at any time and the room service works 24h. The staff always fast, nice and helpful. Overall I had a very good stay and it's an hotel I would definitely recommend. But if I have to compare it to another 5* like the Hotel Me, which is not far from the Alma, I would say it is probably a step below as far as food is concerned, particularly the breakfast.

We still had a bitter reminder of a terrible experience at the Amsterdam Hilton (we are writing our review in their site), our first in all of our years of travel, and were hoping for no more nasty surprises. But the very moment we stepped into the Alma Hotel, we just knew this would be very different...... After being asked to sit and being offered a glass of Cava, we were greeted and registered by (very attentive and engaging) Guillermo Esteve. As we found out, he indeed personified the smart, professional and friendly staff that makes this hotel a gem. After giving us his undivided attention and specific details as well as advise on how to make the best of our time in that city, he brought us to our room, a large and wonderful suite with two balconies overlooking Mallorca street. Stylish yet with very comfortable furnishings and bedding. An equally large bathroom with tub, separate shower room. All beautifully designed. All glistening and impeccably clean. We could happily have stayed there for weeks (and we are picky travelers). The hotel itself is a 1910 building recently renovated: they kept the elegant facade and original side staircases and converted it into a contemporary yet welcoming hideaway. The location is awesome, half a block from Passeig Gracia, steps from lots of restaurants and upscale shops, two blocks from Gaudi's La Pedrera (and the \"hop/on, hop/off bus if you are sightseeing) as well as a short distance from amazing Sagrada Familia. The lobby, bar, and lovely garden with tables and sofas are a wonderful way to start or end your day with privacy. It was clear that even for a new hotel, Alma's charming garden and inside restaurant area, was already attracting groups for late dinner and brunch gatherings. I will remember the breakfasts and nightcaps at that garden for a long time to come..... But in spite of how this lovely small hotel is, it could have probably been unremarkable if not for the attentive and friendly staff who make you feel at home without a fuzz. Restaurant staff, bartender, everyone..... I agree with Valeria in every way (please read her review), \"angeles at front desk and everywhere.\" Our holiday started with an unexpected bad beginning at a well known hotel in Amsterdam and the management at that hotel should take detailed lessons from the awesome staff at Alma. Muchas gracias to everyone at Alma for making our stay in beautiful Barcelona a very wonderful one. We could not have asked for more. We recommend it without reservation and would stay no place else next time we go to Gaudi's city......", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sopot, Poland", "Title": "\u201cperfect hotel in a perfect\u201d", "Author": "michael o", "ReviewID": "UR118878080", "Content": "Amazing hotel !!!

Its location was perfect and much less touristy than had we stayed at Las Ramblas. Its location is situated right in between 2 metro stations. Best of all is that one of it is the Renfe station which connects to the Airport train. Either way was only a 2 block walk (less than 10 mins) to the metro stations. Lots of taxis available and the hop on hop off tourist bus also stops just round the corner from it. Eixample is also perfect for restaurants, tapas bars and shopping. It is in fact I think only 2 entrances away from Louis Vuitton and I do recommend the Torres caffe which is diagonally across from the hotel entrance. The Gaudi museum is also only 2 blocks down from it. Service was superb and rates were really good for the location. I think the surrounding hotels such as the Majestic etc. would cost much more and being such a new hotel, 3 months old, we probably got some introductory rate that is bound to go up in time. Room was really high tech but only thing I found the lighting a bit dark and when we were there most of the facilities such as gym and pool was still being renovated. But they more than made up for in service levels. Plus we also got free mini bar drinks!", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cImmaculate Location, Service has yet to improve\u201d", "Author": "yrtx4e", "ReviewID": "UR118210848", "Content": "Based on the limited reviews, I gave Alma Barcelona a try for our 5-night stay because I had a great experience at another ALMA. My review below might sound picky, I have to rate ALMA BCN like with the alike, IF ALMA BCN wants to be a 5-star, then they have to rectify these flaws. Location: Immaculate!! on Malloca ,a few steps walk to Paseig de Gracia. One block south of Casa Mila. 10 mins walk to Sagrada Familia. Room: booked a grand deluxe room. 40 sq m. is pretty spacious after checking info with so many hotels. Our room is 301 (now they are only opening up to 3rd floor). The keyless/cardless room entry is very smart by using finger-print , but frustrating enough it took us 5 tries in 3 days (the second day we were given a heavy key) only my husband's fingerprint worked, mine still didn't work until I checked out, I gave up to ask them to rectify it. The deco is minimalist, with a lot of open shelves. Room is dimly lit. Closet is tall but with just a few hangars. Bath robes and slippers are there. So much walking to see Gaudi 's work, I expect a shoeshining sponge or mitt in the closet. (No...) Free minibar is a plus that supplement the absence of tea/coffee maker. There are many electric sockets that I am impressed with but the desk is too small to work on. Wooden parquet floor is good, I believe BCN winter is not very cold. Granddeluxe room is overlooking the courtyard and also facing to many residential buildings. The front facing rooms are all suites. The toilet is separated from the bath room (with tub, shower cubicle, double sinks). Amenities is surprisingly deficient. I have to ask for cotton wool & Q tips. There is no shower-cap, fortunately, we don't need it. The quality of the Bvlgari soap and shower gel is interesting, it seems no matter how long I rinse off, body and hands still feel soapy. They don't hve pillow menu as other 5-star properties, I asked for a firmer pillow, I ended up had 3 of the very soft down-pillow that still didn't help much with neck support. The room seemed not prepared for guests. The first night, our room temp was 26C, despite I have tried to set the temp down, but in vain, the temp is locaed at 26C and the fan speed of the ventilation was locked too. I had to open the room door at 2am to taste the cool air from the corridor. The next morning I complained, then they said the room temp is set by their computer, so at the front desk, immediately I requested to set it to 24C that I m being very environmentally friendly. All these flaws, at check-in, they can ask guests, their desired room temp, the personal amenities they want (shower cap, cotton wool...) Hotel info sheet, hotel in-house dept diretory or stationery are all absent, e.g. numbers for reception/housekeeping/concierge. The desk is very small, you can work on it with your laptop on. The chair is very uncomforter for working longer time. There is a leather lounger that you can relax but TV is a bit small. Wifi is free and no hiccups. Service: Before arrival, their email responses were prompt. I had two restaurant reservations made through them. Savi at reception did follow-up for me and gave other recommendations. One disappointing fact is I have never been to a 4-star+ hotel the main entrance is never manned attended! The main door is very heavy, after shopping with bagss on hand, every time my return, the staff clustered at the recpetion desk chatting, no one bothered to stand up to help with the door so I can enter. I had to put down my shopping bags to push open the door with all my might Under-PAR... The staff are very friendly but esp the concierge is not knowlegeable enough. At least two staff doesn't even know about Lasarte (a 2-star michelin) just across the street. I asked about the Aeri del Port, they kept referring it to the Telegraphic at Montjuic. Thanks to internet, they finally found it and wrote me a paper for the cab driver. Housekeeping ~ inconsisent service. Free Minibar was not stocked up fully. Given the hotel is so new, so it is very clean, esp the wood parquet floor. The staff laid a linen on the marble counter for my bottles of skincare was very thoughtful. Since water spashed easily with the over=counter sink, the linen was wet, I pulled it out for her to replace a dry one, but she just folded the wet one back. Given all the hiccups we had encountered, we decided to not have breakfast in the two mornings that we planned for, we at first planned to have dinner one night. We have no confidence at all. Management ~~ we had quite a few complaints, on our 4th day, a gentleman called up one afternoon said he would like to talk to us. I assumed he is the Manager or the assitant manager of the hotel, he heard of our complaints, then want to understand more. We talked at the entry of our room for almost 10 mins. I asked for his namecard, he said he doesn't have one, and would pass one on later that never happened. I have never encountered a hotel management so unprepared (without a name card to self-introduce) to meet with a client/house guest!! Until I checked out, I never get to know who was that gentleman. In other properties, the management would invite you to go down to his office or the lounge to discuss about the issues , instead of standing in my doorway.. very different manner in customer service in BCN or just at ALMA. I don't sense their genuine sincerity to lure guests return. Overall -- LOCATION is PERFECT. free minibar in the hot weather of BCN & Free Wifi is stable, to some guests these pluses may make up for the flaws, but for ALMA, they have the hardware to become a 5-star, but the software, the management, the heart to anticipate guests need is not just arts, it requires dedicated efforts. if you don't mind the minimalist decor and mingy amenities. (ask whatever you want then). A 4 or 5-star property should anticipate the wants/needs of the guests, not waiting for the guests to ask for each bit and pieces. I might be very demanding.. I do understand hotel tariff in BCN is high, but with the same price, I believe that are many choices out there along Pass. de Gracia or along Rambla Catalyuna. We were very disappointed with the overall service.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Alma Barcelona", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d2102457-Reviews-Alma_Barcelona-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$269 - $414*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mallorca 271</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2102457", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/3d/ac/24/reception.jpg"}}
