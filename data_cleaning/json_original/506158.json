The obvious plus points of the hotel are it's central location and the good, varied buffet breakfast. The downside is the size of the smaller rooms, the decoration and the noise which even soundproofing fails to exclude. Our first impressions were of a very dark, cavernous and poorly lit entrance hall largely decorated in black. We realised that it was meant to be dramatic but it was deeply depressing. Our room was similarly decorated in shades of dark green/black with little light relief and a small window crammed into a corner. Not only was it miserable but very stuffy but when the window was opened a great wall of \"music\" erupted from the adjacent building which can only have been 10' opposite our window. It was so claustrophobic and noisy that we asked to be moved to a room with the same kind of decor but with a bigger window. We had to pay \u20ac70 but we had no option. The rooms are all reasonably furnished and the bathrooms and rooms are very clean. We had a problem getting any milk for the room tea -- it simply never arrived after it was requested and you are left with one small bottle of water on the first night with no subsequent replacements. The noise from La Rambla continued until the early hours when it was taken up by some residents screaming in the corridor outside our room.........it would be fair to say that this was not the hotel for us!", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cBarcelona: Hotel 1898: Good hotel, but be critical which part you stay\u201d", "Author": "TravelGeeks2009", "ReviewID": "UR128150898", "Content": "The first impression when you get into the hotel is a bit of a dark brown mahoney bit of an antique type of hotel, but soon you discover that attractive and a tastefully modern touch can be found everywhere in the hotel from reception lounge area to the library, even the hotels corridors, not always the most attractive place in any hotel. Everywhere you can find large b/w photos on the walls of every space, from restaurant to the spa, library, bar as well as in the corridors of the 7 floors of the hotel. Stayed in a room on the 3rd floor at the front side so facing the Rambla, the busiest street/walkway of Barcelona. That was a mistake, the first night as I heard all sorts of noises that you can imagine, street shouting during the small hours at night, cars, even the metro/underground/train could easily be heard. If you are sensitive for all kind of noises (despite the double glass windows) make sure you stay at the quieter side of the hotel. The reception gently moved me to the 6th floor away from the street. The beds are comfy, the interior of the rooms is rather spacious even in the cheaper room class, nicely colored Japanese red good lighting (can be dimmed, very nice), wooden floors and a modern, comfortable bathroom with full amenities. Internet is free (I like that, still too many hotels making this not a standard part of the room package against sometimes ridiculous prices). Breakfast is rich (good selection). The hotel has a small but nice indoor swimming pool and a SPA, although booking a massage wasn't easy as they only seemed to have one masseuse). One thing that could be improved is that there is no in room movie channel (not a big deal if you are an iPad fan with TV shows no your iPad, but still...). The front desk had some good and worthy recommendation for tapas, a must when you are in Spain.

Our friends had stayed here previously and enjoyed it so much they suggested it again for this trip. I am so glad they did as overall this is a gem of a hotel and an excellent hotel for exploring wonderful Barcelona! It is situated on La Rambla and is centrally located and convenient for most of the sites, especially the Old Town and Port area. It is a short ish cab ride from the airport too. Whilst the reception is dark it feels like you've walked into a Ralph Lauren show room. There is lots of black and browns, large furniture and heavy curtains and blinds, making it very stylish and sophisticated. It has a lot of beautiful period features which have been tastefully incorporated into the look and feel. We were allocated a room on the 6th floor (I requested a room on a high floor when I made the booking as I'd read reports about noise issues on lower floors) and I am pleased we were up high for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we simply had to leave our room, turn the corner, walk up a stair case and we were out on the beautiful roof deck complete with plentiful loungers, chairs, bar and swimming pool! The panoramic views across the city were wonderful and it is a great way to unwind after spending a day exploring the city. Secondly, it is very quiet up on the 6th floor and you have fantastic views out across the city skyline. The basement Spa is also delightful with a nice pool, steam room and sauna and massage facilities and gym. It is nice to have this facility to use and enjoy and a great way to relax. Whilst the rooms are not massive, it shouldn't take the shine of the hotel as hopefully you'll be out enjoying the city. The room are well appointed and decorated. The beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms is also nice. Generally the service in the hotel was of a good standard. We only experienced helpful, friendly and professional staff. Breakfast was of a good quality and at 22 euros per person seemed reasonable for the variety on offer. Check breakfast is included in your rate as ours wasn't even though we thought it was.

Hotel 1898 was just as expected from the other tripadvisor reviews and the hotel website. We were in Room 401, a Classic corner unit. The room itself was well-appointed. The decor was quite sophisticated, in dark green, wood, and silver hardware. The bed was larger than the ones in the other hotels we stayed in during our trip. I would consider it a true king. The air conditioning worked perfectly. Wireless internet was free. As for toiletries, from what I can remember, you're provided with tooth brushes, a shaving kit, shower cap, comb, shampoo, lotion, body wash, and two pairs of slippers. The room has some neat technology. The mirror in the bathroom does not fog up. The light switch has various levels of intensity (regular, welcome, reading, relax, etc.). Room 401 has a small balcony (less than a foot in width so you can't go out there). There is no view. They provide one bottle of water upon check-in. However, all other water is from the mini bar, which is not free. No irons are provided. There are two swimming pools, one on the roof top and another on the bottom floor. The one on the bottom floor looks just like what you see on the website pictures. The roof top pool is kind of small. Although the pools are heated, we skipped the upstairs pool b/c it was too cold and rainy. Even if you don't go swimming in the roof top pool, the roof top deck is definitely worth checking out. The set up is nice and the views are amazing. There is a bar up there. (However, it wasn't open when we were there. Probably b/c it was too cold.) I can imagine that during warmer weather it would be very cool to hang out up there. There is a fitness room & spa. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to check out either. The fitness room did look well equipped with up-to-date machines. The spa also looked very nice. The hotel is located in a great spot. It is close to the Metro and right in the midst of all the fun on the Rambla. From the hotel we were able to walk to most sights. (My husband and I are walkers.) We did take the metro to Sagrada Familia. From Sagrada Familia, we walked a ways and caught a bus to Parc Gruell. We never got to Barceloneta, so I cannot attest to whether that distance is walkable. Judging from the map however, I'm sure it would have been fine. Our favorite places in Barcelona were the Picasso Museum, our self-tour of Gaudi's work (which, included Park Gruell, Sagrada Familia, & the homes on the Block of Discord), and the Catalan Concert Hall. The Concert Hall is beautiful. You can buy tickets for a tour during the day. Or, you can do what we did...We bought the cheapest tickets ($29/person) for a classic guitar concert at night. It was one of the most memorable moments we had in Barcelona.

The hotel has an entrance on La Rambla and also a side entrance. Look for Carrefour Supermarket and it is just after that. Staff: Always ready to assist. Reception staff were very helpful.

The hotel is beautifully decorated, the spa is luxurious, and the rooftop bar has great views of the city and a relaxed environment to unwind after a day of sightseeing. We were there in March, so I would advise you that the bar closed at 5:00pm because it was early in the season, unlike our friends who were there in the summer and had late evenings there before or after dinner. We received a tip from another patron before we left the hotel to purchase and print our sightseeing tickets for Sagrada Familia Bacilica in the business center of the hotel, this tip saved us a two hour wait in the line that we passed when we arrived to the tour!!!!! Breakfast at 1898 is like no other! Beautiful display or meats, cheeses, pastries, breads, yogurt, eggs, fruits, nuts, .....u name it!! And champagne to poor over orange juice for mimosa's.

We ate at the restaurant in the hotel, as well as the bar. Both were fantastic!! I would recommend this restaurant even if you are not staying at the hotel, it was that good. The service and the quality of the food was outstanding. I am getting hungry just thinking about it! The rooms are very nice, with very high end amenities and lighting system. There is not much TV in english, but who really cared. The room was peaceful and allowed for a great rest after sightseeing. The downstairs pool and spa are really unique. Its like going to relax in an underground cave! I could have spent hours in here, it was really and excellent way to unwind after a long day. We didn't take advantage of the spa, but it looked very inviting. There is also a small gym for working out. All at no extra charge. Since it was winter, we did not visit the rooftop pool.

The bathroom had a lovely full bath with waterfall shower, really nice ETRO bath products, bathrobes and slippers. In addition there's a coffee tea set equipped with a kettle. My favorite part of the room was the light settings, that can be changed from any part of the room and control all the lights. A small but really nice touch.

Returned to Barcelona, knowing we had choices for many of the fine hotels, but decided to stay here again, spend the extra euros on a larger room overlooking Las Ramblas. Unfortunately for us, the room we were assisgned on the 4th floor literally shared an exterior wall with the church and BELL TOWER next door. Worse yet, the headboard of the bed was on this wall, and every 15 minutes and on the hour, LOUD BELL CLANGING went on, literally blasting and shaking us in the bed. It was awful. We decided early on it might just be a holiday thing and would end soon, but right through New Year's - BANG, BANG, BANG ALL NIGHT LONG! Since we had travelled from Denver, CO to Barcelona for a long stay, we had many suitcases and bags, most of which we were not interested in re-packing and going to the front desk to get into an argument about why they \"could not move us, the hotel was full, etc\". Upon check out, we mentioned this terrible inconvenience to the deskclerk in hopes he might swing a small amount of compensation our way for the awful noise. He said he would mention it to the manager, he was not empowered to do anything, but he made it VERY CLEAR TO US THAT HE HAS HAD MANY, MANY GUESTSCOMPLAIN ABOUT THIS VERY SAME ISSUE. It was obvious at this point that the hotel knew of the problem, gladly took our euros, then politely tried to downplay the very well-know problem. I decided to respond to the manager when the customary \"how was your stay\" email arrived about a week after our return to the US. I made it clear to the manager that I did not want a free night if we came back to Barcelona, that we should have been warned of the bell beforehand, and given the option of another room. I also made sure that the manager knew that we have travelled throughout the world, and when this sort of thing happens, and it has happened before, that advising us that\" if you had just mentioned this to us, we would have moved you to an equivalent room\" is the patented answer, it is easy to say after the traveller is long gone, and I didn't want to hear it. I simply asked for a small credit to my credit card, especially since we stayed twice during the same trip, and spent many euros with this nice place. The response I got from the manager ignored everything in my email request. He offered a free night if we return, he blamed the bell on the church in that he suggested it was malfunctioning (excuses), says he has NEVER heard about this issue before (odd that his entire staff knew explicitly that the clanging bell is and has been a major problem for those unfortunate enough to stay anywhere near that corner of the hotel), and advised he would have gladly switched us to another room had we said something while there (exactly what I asked him not to insult me with, as we all know this is code for covering mistakes and screwups), which I believe would have been impossible since the hotel for our room rate was booked (plus we didn't want to go to the immense trouble of packing everything up and schlepping off to another end of the hotel, which may not have fronted Las Ramblas). While the hotel was very nice, the breakfasts were high quality, I would not recommend this hotel just because of the poor, poor management response to my email. He didn't listen, didn't understand our issues, made excuses, blamed others, followed the universal code for poor service at a hotel and then basically insulted me with his email response to my complaint. We will not be back to this hotel, will not recommend it, will advise family and friends in the area to stay elsewhere and hope that by reading this review, hotel management learns and reacts more appropriately next time....and you know there will be a next time.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location and Staff\u201d", "Author": "TexasJewels", "ReviewID": "UR123778255", "Content": "About \u20ac30 from the airport, Hotel 1898 is in the heart of Barcelona.

Close to La Rambla and the Gothic district, it was a quick walk to all the shopping and sites of the area.

We had the pool in the spa to ourselves one evening - we didn't get a chance to use the rooftop pool and bar because it was pretty chilly when we were there, but it seemed like it could be a pretty happening place in season. The staff had no problem providing us with a late check out or offering us answers to any questions we had. The room service was forgettable. We are from a big city ourselves and street noise doesn't bother us - but there will definitely be a bit of this due to it's location right on La Rambla (I think that is part of what makes it fun.) I would recommend this property for a couple seeking romance in an urban setting or to a 30-something group looking to shake things up in style.

We flew in from JFK at 7:30 am and took the Aerobus right across from baggage direct to Placa Catalunya for about $12 American money. It took about 30 minutes and drops you off about a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel. It was easy to find right across from the birdcages. The staff was very welcoming and helped me with my iphone which would not work and sent me to a phone store to get the settings turned on. The hotel was a small boutiquey type with a restaurant and nice decor. We upgraded and had a beautiful room. It was not real large but had all the fancy marble and lighting and the most comfortable linens and amenities. We could walk right to the market, gothic quarter, touring bus and feel safe walking around the Ramblas at night. You can't go wrong if you want location.

I will start right off by saying I was a little disappointed with the reception we got when we checked in. The staff was nice enough, but they messed up our room reservation and didn't really handle it the right way in order to rectify the situation. Basically, we reserved a Superior Room, but they had us down for a Classic Room. They forced me to go to the business center and print out my confirmation to prove to them that we had, in fact, reserved a Superior Room. We were in our Classic Room at this point, and once I proved it to them, they then conceded that they had made a mistake and it took about an hour for them to move us to the correct room. An honest mistake, but could have been handled better - especially at $430/night!! That was the only negative experience of our hotel stay - the rest of the stay was amazing. The location does not get any better than this. Right off of Las Ramblas, which is the heart and soul of Barcelona, with the benefit of being on a quieter side-street, so you don't get any of the noise. The hotel, itself, was very cool. Nice lobby and bar/lounge area, cool spa/fitness center setup in the lower level, and the roofdeck lounge/pool was fantastic. The room was small, as most big-city hotel rooms are, but was extremely clean, and handsomely appointed. The lighting and music (yes, music was piped in to the room and bathroom) could be controlled by easy switches right next to the headboard - we loved this and was a nice touch. Bathroom was clean and fine - only one sink. Great experience and would definitely return to this hotel - if you're ok with paying these prices, I fully recommend it. I also recommend upgrading to the Superior room (or Deluxe room) because it provides an external view of the street/plaza and a small balcony (the Classic rooms face inwards towards the courtyard, I believe - and no balcony).", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hove, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel for a weekend away or longer\u201d", "Author": "petet45", "ReviewID": "UR119402746", "Content": "The 1898 is a great hotel with tasteful decor in a wonderful location right on La Rambla within easy walk of the old town, Born, the port etc but while you are there you won't know as the hotel is well soundproofed from the outside world and even the idyllic rooftop bar is very quiet with lovely views over the city. If you want to find a nice easy place to eat and drink, Bar Lobo next door (turn left down Carrer d'en Xucia) sits in a nice square and is cheap but with a good vibe. I would make a couple of mildly negative comments, the hotel is very dark especially if you are in a room overlooking the atrium in the middle. You move from bedroom to breakfast (massive selection, generally good quality) without seeing any daylight and I found that I struggled to wake up until I had been outside for a while. Secondly, there is a lot of internal noise from pipes and people in the corridors and as we are light sleepers, we needed to put in my trusty earplugs to sleep. All that said we would definitely come back again and would be more than happy to spend several days in the hotel due to the wide range of facilities available. Feel free to message me if you would like any other tips or information. By the way the city tour bus is as boring as hell and tends to take you to stops which are 10 to 20 minutes walk from the attraction itself. We also got stuck in the riots over the weekend and were dumped 30 minutes walk from the stop in Plaza de Catalunya even though the side roads looked pretty clear. I would personally use taxis which are cheap and plentiful.

On arrival, they were indeed there, but the water was freezing cold in both swimming pools! It was so cold in the spa that those nice jacuzzi chairs they've got, were simply uncomfortable! Worst of all, when we complained, the staff said they knew about it, but there was nothing they could do, because the administration of the hotel doesn't want to act unless anough clients complain directly to them!! The room was nice, but if you're staying in the left part of the hotel, it's directly above the tube line, so you will hear quite loud vibration from it every 5 mins or so, which is annoying, especially late at night or early in the morning. We then moved to the other part of the hotel where there was no noise from the tube, but the noise from the street was quite loud even with the windows closed. The staff was not proactive at all, we had to repeat every signly request at least 2-3 times before they got it. Also, they don't provide irons, even the mini ones, so be prepared to pay 8 euros to get a shirt ironed for that nice dinner you booked in the city. I don't understand all the good reviews - we weren't able to use any of the swimming pools even though the weather was amazing, couldnt really enjoy the spa and the level of service is just not good enough.

It is newly redesigned and remodeled to perfection. Every space is sleek, stylist and fashionable. Stepping into the lobby is red carpet all the way, the rooftop bar is a sweeping view of all of Barcelona with great service and the rooms are perfect. Every detail is perfection. The staff before arrival was very helpful, informative and ready for our arrival. We asked for a guide for the day as we only had one day in Barcelona. That, also, was perfection. The guide spoke excellent English, was professional, on time and showed us Barcelona in 3 hours! Above all, we felt SAFE! We quickly learned that safety is of utmost importance in Barcelona. If you are not on your toes, your passport and everything in your pockets and hotel safe will be gone in a flash. Oh, did I mention the spa in this hotel? The prettiest I have ever seen.

Our room had very high ceilings and although oddly configured (with a large foyer) it felt spacious. The real stars are the pool areas. The underground spa pool is dimly lit and feels like an underwater grotto. The rooftop pool, while small, has ample seating including lounge chairs, daybeds, and the like. The roof is beautifully landscaped and also includes a restaurant and bar. The only complaint about the hotel is actually the puzzling lax service at the rooftop. Although this issue is endemic to Spain (and Barcelona in particular, from my observation) it was almost like you had to beg someone to bring you a drink. Also, it should be noted that with the USD's lack of buying power, the drinks (when you could get them) were really expensive. But, another plus is the excellent breakfast buffet that was included in our rate. It was extensive with every imaginable pastry, fresh fruit, juice, coffee, charcuterie, cheese, and even a choice of hot dishes such as omelettes.

It wasn't steamy, or even warm. -According to the Frommer's travel book, they warn against lower level rooms - because you \"may\" hear the train. We heard the train every 10 mins. We couldn't change rooms because none were available. Thank goodness we were so tired to sleep through. However, at these prices the train should not be an issue.

Our room was well-appointed and comfortable - no complaints there - and they gave us a twin room as requested. Hotel 1898's biggest selling point has surely got to be its roof terrace. I was expressly looking for a city centre hotel with a pool and a roof terrace, but I was staggered at how spacious the terrace was. There were dozens of chairs and tables, sun loungers, day beds, comfy seating, shade and umbrellas, and table services from the very helpful waitresses. It was the perfect place to spend lazy days and evenings and night-times, and I would definitely go back during the clement months just for that asset alone. The pool was modest, but definitely a decent size - I gather many rooftop hotel pools in Barcelona are little more than a plunge pool.. There is also a lovely pool in the spa, which was a welcome surprise, with sauna and steam room.

Stayed here for 4 nights with a girlfriend on our annual long weekend away to catch up. Ideally situated smack in the middle of the tourist areas, only 10 mins walk to the beach one way, 3 mins walk to the St Joseph's market the other, and many plazas with restaurants and shops in all around. The hotel is large, with traditional architecture but modern amenities. The room we were in (one of the entry price ones) was quite compact but comfortable, and the bathroom was very nice. Its not the cheapest place around but I felt it was worth it and would definitely consider staying here again on my next visit to the city. The best thing we found about this place was the roof terrace which appeared to be open until about 2am and was never really the busy. There's a bit of greenery up there and chill out/jazz music playing which adds to the atmosphere and drowns out some of the street noise. There are lots of comfy sun lounges and king sized shaded cabanas, with a small pool (more for a refreshing dip than to swim in), a cocktail bar and al fresco dining (not particularly cheap). We would start off our day with a lay in and coffee in the hotel before a swim in the basement spa area and then heading up to the terrace to sunbath/read/snooze (it did get VERY hot in August, obviously!), then head to the market for a late lunch at the boqueria (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boqueria) and a bit of a wander around the local lanes and shops to help digest, before either retiring back to the terrace for late afternoon cocktails or doing some sightseeing (beach, Gaudi buildings, etc) until it was time to get ready for the evening activities.

The hotel also has a large rooftop terrace with cabanas and loungers around a swimming pool, but as it was February when we went this was not really utilised, The cellar also has a fabulous pool with different spa features and the usual Steam room and sauna, together with a well equipt Gym and treatment rooms.

We went into the restaurant to have breakfast and were dissapointed with the lack of anything really decent to eat, just continental style pastries and cakes, some fruit etc ( I have stayed in Holiday Inns with a better breakfast) we went back to the cashier at the hotel entrance without eating anything and she immediately removed the breakfast from our room bill. I must say that the entire staff were very friendly and super efficient and that the hotel is most definately worth of it's star rating. I would stay at this hotel again and as I am a travel agent I have recommended it to several of my clients who have each been very happy with the hotel. We ate in some fantastic tapas restaurants, and also in a great \"ala carte\" restaurant called \"Monroe's\" in the Gothic Quatre, just across the road from our hotel. Also don't miss the Tour Bus trips from the Plaza de la Catalonia, we got the 2 day pass and this allowed us to do both routes and see all the main tourist sights. There are pickpockets in Barcelona in the main tourist areas, but if you keep your valuables out of sight and take care of your belongings at all times you will be fine, they are just as bad in all major cities, London has it's fair share. Also don't be lured into the street \"find the lady \" games, as whilst you are watching this diversion the organised pickpockets take your wallets and pass them to another so that nobody would be able to trace who has it. Barcelona is a beautiful city, it combines all the sights and culture of old Catalonia with a lovely beach and stylish Marina area, I have been back again with business in May this year but the hotel I stayed in did not compare to the H1898. A tip for the Ladies, leave your best heels at home unless travelling by taxi to a restaurant, the cobbled streets will wreck them.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat! wouldn't stay anywhere else!\u201d", "Author": "AA3000", "ReviewID": "UR115918118", "Content": "We (2 adults, 1 2yr-old) stayed there for a week in July 2011.

Bathroom: modern, new, clean, great shower, lots of toiletries (including full-sized toothbrush). Yes, the soap is small and non-standard, but we always bring our own soap anyway. Roofdeck/pool: really new/modern/beautiful. the pool itself was of course small, but most people just went in to get a little wet before going back to lay in the sun in the luxurious chairs.

We also went downstairs to look at the spa and it was completely tore apart, but it looked like a wonderful place, I sure wish it would have been open. It would have made this the perfect place.

My wife and I were traveling with 4 parents who had two small children. The check in staff were friendly and got us to our rooms very quickly after a plus 20 hour trip which was appreciated. We stayed in a standard room. The size of the room was very adequate. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was user friendly and everything was clean. We were very impressed with the breakfasts that we had every morning at the hotel. Actually one of the better hotel breakfasts we've had in quite some time. There are 3 elevators that serve the hotel. Only one of which will take you to the 7th floor which is the rooftop where there is a pool, bar , lounge type area. Very nice. There are pictures on the site. The elevator situation is a little confusing because only one elevator will take you to the 7th and often you would have to wait quite a while to hit the jackpot and have those particular elevator doors open. Often we would just ride up to the 6th floor which all the elevators did and then walk up the stairs to the 7th floor. The waiters were very hit or miss on the roof. Some were friendly while others made you feel like you were bothering them. The bartender downstairs in the lobby was very friendly and helpful. The biggest annoyance with the hotel for me was the very spotty wi fi internet connection. It was ok in our room but the other two families had problems with it and at best it would sign you out after a minute of non use. It was impossible to get wi fi at all on the roof which must be particularly annoying for business travelers. I did not use the indoor pool but it looked nice. The gym was small but adequate for a run on the treadmill. The weight stack was too light to be of any real use. The hotel is located in the \"times square\" of barcelona close to all the attractions. Also when people warn of pick pocketers, it's no joke. I saw quite a few roaming the crowds. We had some tapas and wine across the street from the hotel on our second night and the waiter asked us if we could change a 50 euro note. We thought it was a little odd but gave him change. We discovered the next night when we used that note to pay for part of our meal that it was counterfeit. We went back to the restaurant and of course they denied it but returned our money.

We chose this hotel based on trip reviews of others and from a traveller TV program. We were not disappointed. The lobby decor is tastefully done. The hotel is very conveniently located (side entrance and the main address is on La Rambla, the busy street but the main entrance is on a side street, directly opposite of Le Meridien). Every staff member was polite and courteous and generally helpful. Our rooms were a tad small but tastefully decorated. All fixtures worked (though the shower takes some getting used to). Most importantly the rooms were clean and tidy. Housekeeping was excellent. The hotel is about 3min walk to the Metro and is in the shopping district (for tourists) and lots of reasonable priced restaurants and shops in the side streets. We were near MACBA and visited there (don't recommend it though). Negatives/annoyances: We had 2 rooms. One was fine but we had a problem with the other. When we entered the room, it didn't have the aircond turned on while the other one did. We found it strange but it wasn't a problem and the porter happily showed us how to control the aircond. The TV was also smaller than the other room but we weren't that bothered. HOwever after 15min of aircond, we noticed a very strange smell in the room. We suspected it was due to the aircond. We brought the problem to the front desk staff who suggested that we move to another room but wanted us to pay more because the room was a grade higher than what we booked. I politely refused and asked that he either finds me another room on the same floor at the same price or fix the aircond problem. After much discussion with his manager, they managed to move us to another room at the same price as we booked and on the same floor. This new room didn't have the funny smell, was clean, and had the same size TV as the other room (where my kids were staying). But there was a problem with this room too -- the card access wasn't working so they gave us keys to access our room and a card key for the elevators. This was not a big problem but was a hassle because housekeeping only had card key to access our rooms, not the normal keys. The offshoot was we had to stay to let housekeeping into the room so that she could clean it. Luckily most stores aren't open until 10am so was more of an annoyance. I highly suspected that the front desk knew of the problems with the rooms but didn't offer to upgrade us to compensate for our troubles. Also we asked several front desks of which Gaudi museums we should visit because we were only going to be in Barcelona for a day and half. We were surprised that they weren't able to offer any advice and instead asked us which ones we would like to visit! We were quite surprised that they weren't as helpful as we'd hope -- we got the feeling that, whilst they were polite, they weren't that interested in helping us. In other words, do your own research before going to Barcelona if you are poised to stay in this hotel. To be fair to the staff, they did provide us good directions to the tourist attractions, once we knew which ones we wanted to visit. They also helped us made reservations to a Tapas restaurant that they recommended. The food was ok. Other than those irritations, breakfast was very good, pool on the terrace was excellent though tad small (one cannot swim laps in it). There's also a small pool in the basement that is very nice and had a serene environment as it was in the Spa area. The gym seemed small but we never had a chance to use it. All in all, service was generally good and we were able to overlook the annoyances with our experience with the rooms (we also found out many of the rooms were under renovations, even though the front desk told us they were fully booked!).

While you may not think you will be spending any significant time in your room, occasionally we like to relax and watch a movie before bed, or have some tv on in the background while we get ready in the morning, well, unless you want the BBC news, or Spanish programming, you're mostly out of luck.

The hotel is immaculate - especially considering the absolutely nutty scene on the street just outside. Actually, make sure you put the do not disturb sign on the door if you come back for an afternoon rest because the cleaning staff is quite zealous and will walk into your room without knocking (happened twice, but no big deal). We purposely focused on getting a quiet room - actually the least expensive in the hotel - because we are not big partiers and didn't want to deal with the street noise after calling it a night. Our room was very quiet (401). The pool is largely a waste, in my opinion, because it's in the basement and you feel like you're swimming in a cave.

So far, we have had an excellent experience and would rate this hotel highly. About the only critical thing I can think to mention is the prices on the Tapas bar on the roof are a little high. Each items is roughly 10 Euros. My son and I each had 2 for around 46 Euros and were still quite hungry. That being said, the rooftop terrace is very nice and very relaxing. We sat and watched the city as the sun was waning in the early evening and the value of that far exceeded the somewhat pricey Tapas. FYI - there is a great Gelato place about a block off La Rambla (when you go out the side entrance) that is really good. We will be stopping there again during the trip.

The hotel would do well to employ a designated concierge given the large number of foreign guests. They are not overly helpful or knowledgable about events, sights, or restaurants. In the front office's defense they are quite occupied with the large number of guests checking in and out.. For the price they should offer the service.

The foyer is magnificent - lots of dark woods, black leather Chesterfield couches, opulence personified. Situated right on the main pedestrian boulevard of La Rambla, we were right in the centre of things, yet we had no issue with any noise. The Mercat La Bouqueria (a most wonderful food market with freshly squeezed juices and fruit that looked and tasted as if it was picked that day), was within a 100 metro walk from the front door - off La Rambla. One could immerse oneself there for hours as there was tapas, fruit, and an assortment of food there to keep all intrigued. The hotel has a complementary business centre with two Apple and two Windows based computes available for guests to use in an opulent setting on the 1st floor. There is a magnificent terrace tapas bar which overlooks the city and is a wonderful setting to view the lights of the city on cushions and wooden decking. Our room had two very comfortable single beds pushed together in the European style, with a pillow selection we did not have to avail ourselves of. We used the spa and sauna which is on the basement level - a very relaxing experience complete with dry and steam sauna's, pool with inbuilt chairs in the spa and fountains in a similar atmosphere to a Arabian styled hamman. My friend had a very relaxing one hour foot and leg massage for 85 Euros, which compared to Paris, was reasonable, given the luxurious surrounds. The room had a fridge, deep bath, toilet, bidet, comfortable chair and large LED TV affixed to e wall. The Service staff are exemplary in their duties - nothing was too much trouble. The toiletries we high quality and refilled very quickly, there is a turn down service (complementary) which is a nice touch complete with foot mat on each sides of the beds and chocolates. We called for ice - brought up immediately. There is an in-room safe and great lighting. My only small fault in an otherwise unblemished record, is that there was no iron and board available for guests to use - security was cited as the reason, and although I understand the potential risk of fire, for a hotel of such quality to not offer this was surprising.

The bread wasn't good, the fruits were tasteless, the fresh-squeezed orange juice wasn't good, and to top - the omelet was oily and cold!! A bad breakfast in any situation, but at the price of 25euro/person I think this is unforgivable. Of note, there is an alternate breakfast option at the hotel - on the 1st floor at 21euro/person; we did not try so I cannot comment. In general I rarely go out of the hotel for breakfast because I don't like looking for something in the morning, but in this case I felt that the prices for bfast were unreasonable. My experience with the front-dest staff was neurtal. They were neither exceptionally helpful, nor unprofessional. A restaurant recommended by the font desk (El Pintor, in the jewish quarter) was not good. A tapas place they suggested - a typical tourist hub with good but mediocre tapas.

It was our first time in Barcelona and I don't think we could have picked a better hotel. We got the aerobus from the airport, buy a return ticket, and it's a very short walk from the bus stop to the hotel. It's a beautiful building and you will not be disappointed with the inside either. We booked a Privilege room as we were celebrating, and it was lovely, very spacious with high quality fixtures and fittings. It overlooked La Rambla but we were not bothered by any noise from the street, though as a light sleeper I was aware of the rumblings of the metro. This may lessen if you are on a higher floor (we were on 3rd floor). We didn't book breakfast in the room rate so didn't eat in the hotel but La Boqueria market is just a short stroll away with fresh fruit platters selling at just 1 euro, and a good selection of fruit juices and smoothies if you are feeling in healthy mood. There are also a few tapas bars there so plenty of choice. The stalls in this market are amazing. Check out the speciality fish displays, plenty of photo opportunities. There's a branch of Starbucks next to the hotel for a more traditional tea/coffee and muffin breakfast. The hotel is very central so ideal for walking/sightseeing but there is also a choice of 2 metro stops if you are feeling less energetic. If you leave the hotel through the side entrance and turn left there is a small square with a selection of tapas bars and restaurants. We didn't use any of these but they always looked busy. Our favourite spot for late afternoon was the roof terrace. Very nicely set up with lots of sofas and daybeds. It seemed to be popular with both guests and local business people. We had a drink there most days and even ordered a bottle of wine on our anniversary. Be warned though, the drinks are not cheap. There is also a food menu though this seemed to be mainly snack type meals, but you do get complimentary nibbles when you order a drink.

We were given a good map by the reception staff which we used the whole time we were there as it was easier to take in and out than a guide book. I have to admit that we were a little edgy about pick-pockets as everybody mentioned them, but we made good use of a 'bum bag' which meant that all valuables were kept close at hand. We made use of the safe in the room to leave anything valuable. It's a short stroll to the water-front, cathedral and Picasso museum and the metro is very easy to navigate. The trains and the fares put the London underground to shame. I would suggest walking to the cable car up Montjuic and catching it back to the port as the queues are much shorter that way.Also don't miss the Fonts Magica at dusk - they are brilliant but the views are even better. Going back to the hotel, the rooftop pool is warm and the whole terrace area is lovely. The spa pool is great too.

The hotel is very decent and as a result - we really enjoyed our stay. It has two entrances - the smaller one from the side of La Rambla and the main one - from the quiet street. Before coming we worried a bit about the location - from our previous journey we knew that La Rambla is a noisy place that never sleeps but everything was just great as we got a room in the farther wing of the hotel with the window to the small calm street. The room was spacious enough (we booked a priviledge one), spotlessly clean, very elegant, decorated with taste and... it had a bathroom with a small terrace. I adore bathrooms with natural light so this was just terrific as was totally unexpected. There was a kettle and an assortment of tea in the room so you could have a cup of tea at any time. We also liked the \"light menu\" that allowed you to choose the combination of lights you prefer during the day - \"welcome\", \"read\", \"relax\" and \"night\" positions, very comfortable indeed. The bed we had in our room was just enormous and so comfortable that you wouldn't want to wake up in the morning. So we didn't miss an opportunity to order breakfast, which was great, to our room. Now let me explain why we do not give it \"excellent\". First, upon arrival we were given the minimum of the information concerning the hotel. Yes, we got a small booklet with all the amenities but it would be rather nice if not to show us around then just to explain where the restaurant is, what we need to use a spa or how to get to the rooftop terrace. Nothing. The only thing we got - \"We have a spa. You can use it\". And that's all. Now the swimming pool they advertise as suitable for swimming turned out to be ridiculously small taking into consideration the number of rooms in the hotel and dangerously hot. So forget about swimming, it will be rather lying in a hot bath with many other people. And the zone itself is not kept properly - there were enormous puddles of water that made the floors slippery. They should understand it's inevitable but very dangerous so there should be either some person constantly wiping the floor or they should put wooden or rubber carpets there. As for the rooftop pool, it is made for kids - too shallow and too small to swim though the idea is great. Next, I've already mentioned that the street under our windows was rather quiet but still if there was some noise outside - like a garbage truck every morning or a group of youngsters having a late night party - you would hear it so double windows would be much appreciated. And the last one. My husband bought me flowers. There was no vase to put them in so we put them into the sink so that the maid could see them and bring us a vase. It didn't happen. Neither on the first day nor on the second. The only thing she did - moved them into the bidet. So that's the 1898 hotel with pluses and minuses we experienced.

The hotel is ideally situated on the Ramblas- perfect location. We had a standard room which was very well decorated and well equiped - apart from the lack of an iron which was a bit frustrating (and surprising for a hotel of this rating) when you arrive with clothes crushed to the max by easyjet baghandlers!! The only way to get them ironed was to pay an extortionate amount to the hotel laundry service (6 euros a piece!). I opted to hang them in the bathroom while having a hot shower and steam the creases out! The room was clean and the shower was fab. It was a nice touch to come back in an evening to a few chocolates. I believe that all the standard rooms overlook over an inner courtyard, so are quiet. I imagine that rooms overlooking the Ramblas might get some local noise. However, i wasnt aware of any noise at any time in any of the other hotel areas so that might be unfair. Unfortunately there was torrential rain for a whole day that we were there and im not sure if it was from this or a leak in the room above, but there was definately a leak... into our bathroom. the staff responded well when it was raised, but i am not sure that it was actually fixed during our stay. Likewise we couldnt get our airconditioning to work at all which meant that the room was a little warm for my husbands liking (but perfect for mine!). There was a rooftop pool, which we unfortunately didnt get a chance to sample (reason to go back though!), but looked fab and warm and there were great views from the roof. We did however sample the indoor pool, gym, sauna and steamroom. Just perfect- cant say any more. The bar was pricey as you would expect from any city centre hotel, but we opted to drink out of the hotel and explore anyway. Breakfast was fantastic- there was absolutely everything available, from cereal and toast to smoked salmon and Cava. The staff were welcoming and friendly and very helpful. I would have no hesitation to recommend this hotel to anyone and look forward to a return visit myself. Tip: Venture off the Ramblas into the side streets to wat and drink there are some really nice and reasonably priced bars and restaurants, but those on the Ramblas are overpriced and not half as good", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cElegant and sumptuous\u201d", "Author": "popjoy", "ReviewID": "UR100232482", "Content": "Fabulous place.

The selection, based on trip advisors advices, was cross-checked with some others guidebooks. Just by entering the hotel lobby, we dive in a great atmosphere; the restauration of this old \"philippine tobacco headoffice\" a couple of year ago is simply great : choice of the materials, mix of wood/stone/modern lightning/lounge music contribute to build an excellent first impression. Reception staffs is multilingual, nice & friendly. We ask for a room with a specific color, and we got it. The rooms are simply wonderfull : same excellent selection of materials, wooden floor, very nice bed, very modern bathroom (and modern shower system), as well as all room services you would expect from a 5 stars hotle (this one has 4 1/2 stars). We got a room with a view on \"la Ramblas\", on the third floor. When the windows are closed, we could not hear the crowd walking on La Ramblas BUT .. what a bad surprise to feel the vibrations of the subway, every 2 minutes; this is the same feeling as experiencing a light earthquake ... heavy & repetive vibrations coming from the gound ... really a bad experience ... that prevent me to sleep during the subway service (hopefully, the subway stops from 0100 till 0600 during the week ... but doesn't stop on Saturday ...). We asked the next morning an other room, on the quiet side of the hotel, and we got it without any difficulties, and with some excuse of the staff (\"yes, this is a well known problem, we are sorry for this, some customers are not noticing it (.. I can not believe this ...)etc etc). I then commented that giving these \"Ramblas\" rooms to customers without notifying them in advance, and without proposing a better price, will seriously impact the reputation of this wonderfull hotel in the future. I got a 10% reduction for the night, as a kind of a compensation, but only after asking for it. This was far less than what I expected for a night without sleep ... That being said, the others services of the hotel were simply perfect : - wonderfull breakfast, worth the price - amazing spa in the ground floor (charming & modern swimming pool in a very old voulted room) - very nice atmosphere at the bar, also attracting some \"real\" persons from Barcelona - excellent food (served at the bar during January11, as the main restaurant was under restauration). - wonderfull terrace on the top floow, with a 30\u00b0c swimming pool (what a feeling to swim in the morning, among the 'smoke' of the pool, with the view on Barcelona waking up ...) So again, one of the best hotel I have been so far ... if you don't get the rooms on \"la Ramblas\". I really advice the management of the hotel to act with more transparency for these rooms, and to propose a reduced prices for it only for the customers who accept this situation. The whole staff at the reception know the issue, but do not inform the customers when they arrive ... and probably hopes that nobody will complaints.

Really excellent contemporary re-design of an older industrial building, our room was comfortable, plenty luxurious without being ostentatious, good pillows, mattresses, amenities, shower, and so on. One of the reasons we picked H1898 was the onsite exercise facility (these are not common by the way), which is pretty good -- a couple treadmills, one stairclimber, multiple exercise bikes; no weight machines, but a set of dumbells if that's your thing, and a beautiful pool (you can see it featured on the website). There're also full spa/massage facilities, which we didn't try, but which seemed quite in demand, and very well staffed. For that matter, the entire hotel staff are really great, friendly, helpful, multilingual. We changed cash everyday, borrowed an umbrella, got directions, called cabs, etc., and were always greeted with a smile, made to feel welcome in every respect. The bar off the lobby is spacious, quiet, w excellent drinks/bartenders, tho like everything else in Barcelona just now, expensive. Likewise the upstairs restaurant, where we stuck with the excellent and copious continental breakfast instead of the, like, 40 dollar breakfast! Again, this is not a cheap city, though the hotel itself is very reasonably priced for what it delivers. It's located directly on La Rambla, Barcelona's hugely popular 'promenade,' busy at all hours, lined w tourist traps of one sort or another (skip these and visit the shops/bars/restaurants off the main drag; don't miss the big produce market two blocks south), but great fun for all that. Our room gave on to a side street, and was perfectly quiet; rooms looking out onto La Rambla itself might prove a little noisy unless you're planning on late nights yourself.

If the hotel is catagorized as 'big 10' in the city, it must be worth staying, depending on our taste preference and budget. This hotel is ranked number 4 and the rank tells itself. I went to Fatima via Lisbon and Barcelona with my wife with an intention of pilgrimage. Because of this, we planned to stay the first 2 nights and then the last 2 nights at Barcelona. Originally, we chose another hotel, but due to the extraordinary experienced we felt, we booked this hotel again to stay for the last two night before going back home. When I chose this hotel, I was utterly confused because the number 1 hotel in the area is at the same location, but cheaper. However, I gave H 1898 a try due to the comment of \"luxury\" and location. The hotel has a good rate for Euro 235 a night, not including the breakfast though. We requested the double superior room facing La Rambla, with an upper floor and a balcony. They gave us exactly the room that we requested. It was a beautiful room, touched with Colonial style and adorned with luxurious wood and double-paned windows. Sophisticated as well as well-equipped plasma screen TV was attached to the cherry red wall. A beautiful radio proudly stands on the desk of our room. Not to forget the free WiFi provided and an enourmous private bathroom featuring elegant marble countertops, shower and a bathtub, and a selection of high quality personal care products. We also got a small balcony that enables us to observe the exciting activity happening in Barcelona's gothic streets. The selection of pillows also guarantee a better sleep, since we can customize our pillow by making a selection from our Pillow Menu. The hotel also has an impressively scented lobby, remarkable decor, luxurious finishing touches and unusual quality. Making this hotel the place for those who appreciate luxury and colonial style. It has an astounding warm water pool and a modern top roof pool. If you can enjoy it while you are here, this will truly amaze you. It is such a pity that we didn't have time to try the pools. The breakfast was beyond outstanding. The collection of fruits, bread, hot food, salad, juice, and buffet gourmet such as lacon, fole, jamon iberico, salmon is served on exquisite platters. The selection of Saint James tea was excepted with open hands by us, a tea lover. The breakfast room in this hotel is located in the first floor of the hotel. The restaurant is one of the places where the beauty of La Rambla Street is perfectly shown. However, after this stay, we now do understand why this hotel, such a magnificent modern hotel, well equipped, safe with a convenient location at La Rambla, is only placed no 4 instead of no 1. It is a hotel everyone would try for, sadly, it is run by people with \"no passion\", so to speak. Sometimes you can feel that Thai and Bali people are so passionate, until the hotel facilities itself becomes number 2 since the people working in it effects too. But certainly not this hotel. The receptionist was stiff and responded with a very standard manner. Here are some examples; when you requested the specific room by email they will respond with unappropriate manner, when you arrived back to the hotel, there wasn't any greeting \" buenes noches\", when you were checked back for the second stay within 3 nights interval, there wasn't greeting, even a simple \"welcome back\" or \"welcome home\" would be nice. It is a remarkable waste for such a comfortable and nice hotel to go to waste. Despite the service, everything was flawless.

Particularly enjoyed the 5 settings of lighting and the modern and well equipped bathroom. The rooftop terrace provides an excellent view of the city with a bar and swimming pool. The spa downstairs in the basement is excellent and well worth a visit to unwind after many an hour pounding the streets. The breakfast is excellent with a vast array of meats, cheeses, fruits, breads even iced cava which sets the day up nicely. For those that have never been to Barcelona before this really is a brilliantly located grand hotel equidistant between all the attractions of the city - close to the metro, place de la catalunya (for the open top bus, bars and restaurants) gothic quarter, beach, Gaudi attractions and Port Vell. My review would not be complete without mentioning the well documented problems regarding pickpockets in the area immediately surrounding the hotel. Namely Las Ramblas. Does it really happen or is the problem symptomatic of any big city? I have experience of visiting many big cities with supposed problems and I will say that Las Ramblas is up there. We witnessed so many pickpocketing events and my strong recommendation is to empty the contents of your wallets, purses and handbags in the hotel safe (all hotel 1898 rooms have them) and just take a minimal amount of cash and one credit card. Men -keep your hand on your wallet at all times, and women keep your handbag round your front with your hand on the opening at all times. Be particularly wary on Las Ramblas when watching the human statues and stopping at the gift shops. Also do not let down your guard when you are in a restaurant, keep your belongings with you at all times. My wife had her handbag lifted from La Fonda restaurant. These people do not look like pickpockets and they are VERY QUICK.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Geneva, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Location\u201d", "Author": "Naper2", "ReviewID": "UR86960637", "Content": "We stayed one night at this hotel after our cruise.

The 'scenes' lighting system with the need to insert a card key to keep the lights on (energy saving feature) is cool the first time and then annoying the rest of the stay. Some rooms have larger floor-to-ceiling windows that open out to street views (cheaper rooms have courtyard views) - some rooms look right over Las Ramblas but the noise might be an issue at night. We didn't eat at the restaurant for dinner this time but ate dinner twice our last trip and it was pricey but solid fare and excellent service. We had the breakfast buffet included in our rate this time and it is quite a spread served in the restaurant. With the open market down the street a cheap terrific breakfast isn't far but if tablecloths and a substantial buffet is what you're looking for, consider the hotel. The spa is unique with its dark 'Turkish Bath' style pool - dramatic mood lighting and arched tiled ceilings make for an interesting swim you won't find at a Marriott or Hilton. Steam spa, dry sauna, showers and a fitness room with treadmills and TVs are also available. Never tried the spa but the menu seems extensive. Service is unobtrusive and the front desk is attentive. Housekeeping is efficient and ever-present with daily service and turn-down at night. The hotel itself is well decorated and the public spaces invite lounging with comfy sofas. Don't miss the silent movies constantly playing off the side of the reception - or the massive bar for a glass of wine. No complaints here - we can't wait for our next visit.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "AnnLee63", "ReviewID": "UR83387547", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel 1898 for three days before we departed for a cruise.

We paid for the upgraded 'superior' room, which was to provide views of Las Ramblas. Not only was our window small and elevated, the only view that was provided was of the 28 windows of the hotel directly across the street off of Las Ramblas - providing NO privacy whatsoever. When I asked for a better room, offering to pay for another 'upgrade', I was told that the hotel was full - despite a couple who walked in off of the steet and were given a room as I stood at the desk (Did they get the last room in the house???).We did have the benefit, however, of the noise from Las Ramblas, late into the night - every night and early in the morning. Our sleep was further disrupted by the cleaning staff who began there task at 0800, banging and crashing in the hallways, dragging chairs on the hardwood floors etc. Robes were provided, along with cheap and very small slippers (which did not fit my husband's size 10 feet), and 2 of the smallest bars of soap I have ever seen. After one use, and the soap was merely a sliver. There were water / soap splashes behind the bidet on the tiled walls from a previous occupant who had washed their private's. These remained during the entire 4 night stay. The egyptian cotton sheets appeared to be part of the 'historical' aspect of the hotel, in that they had numerous small bleach / moth holes. The downstairs hydro-therapy pool was a welcome addition, however, the steam room was not functioning along one of the large jets in the pool. The roof-top patio was also lovely. Considering the cost of alcohol through-out Spain, it was a bit of a GOUGE to charge guests 7 Euros for 1 glass of wine on a patio where signs prohibit the consumption of food / beverages NOT purchased there. The same glass of wine could be purchased anywhere on the touristy Las Ramblas for 3 - 4 Euros. On our last day, we left the room at 1030 to go shopping and have brunch. As I write this review, it now almost 1400, we have returned to a dirty room, with no sign of housekeeping. Value? For 250 Euros per night, I don't think so. The room is small, with only a bed and one comfortable chair jammed in the corner, making room service a challenge. In a city which should be known as a 'den of thieves' due to the high incidence of pick-pocketting and other crimes focussed on tourists, none of the above is hardly surprising.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "stinkykitty", "ReviewID": "UR82996889", "Content": "If you want comfort, security and convenience, choose Hotel 1898.

We had a superior room on the 6th floor it was Beautifully decorated room with a lovely clean bathroom with expensive granite finishes. Being on the 6th floor was great because this hotel is bang on the la rambla so we was not bothered by any noise at all. there was a lovely pool on the roof with sun beds but unfortunatly i didn't go in the pool as although it was the height of summer the pool was freezing and i hardly saw anyone in there even though the pool area was packed out. This was our second trip to Barcelona so we didn't do all the tourist things again such as the hop on/off bus tour but i would recommend it if you havn't been to Barcelona before, it's a great wayto see the city over a couple of days. There are so many fantastic places to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner in this city and we didn't have one bad meal anywhere. The tapas is to die for!! if you like walking then this is the place for you, from this hotel you can walk to the beach, Olympic port and there are some great places to shop but no real bargings to be had with the Euro being so poor at the moment. the only down side to Barcelona is the CRIME it's absolutly rife in this city, although we were not efected this time we were on edge as on our last visit here my husband had his mobile phone stolen and my sister last month had her purse stolen from her bag without even knowing it!! they are good!! it's such a shame as it really lets this amazing city down.

The hotel is beautiful and the 7th Floor terrace, pool and bar are some of the highlights of this place. After exploring the sights all day, it was great to come back and lounge by the pool from about 4-6 pm. As others have noted, it's not a huge pool and often times the chairs would be occupied but I'd just grab a towel and sit on the edge of the pool with my book (or chat with other guests.) And in the evenings, after going out for dinner and more exploring, I'd come back to the hotel and head up to lounge to one of the comfy couches or beds for a glass of cava! I'd hang out and read or write and just enjoy the lights over Barcelona. It felt decadent. Another great feature of the hotel is the spa in the basement of this hotel. Make sure you take advantage of the pool, steamroom and sauna down there. It's all included in the hotel price and it's a luxurious treat. And last but not least, was the great breakfast!! (Make sure when you book your room that you get the breakfast included.) Of all the hotels I stayed at while traveling, this was my favorite breakfast. They had everything: a huge variety of sweet and savory pastries, eggs, bacon, sausages, sliced meats, smoked salmon, cheeses, all kinds of breads, cereal, fruit, yogurt, a variety of juices, champagne, wine... everything! And if that wasn't enough, they would make you omelets or eggs from the kitchen. (I think I read that other reviewers thought the food was cold but understandable given it's a buffet and as noted above, the servers could bring you something hot from the kitchen in addition to your own pot of coffee for the table.) My favorites were the tiny quiches and the cream puffs drizzled with chocolate. So tasty!! I will definitely stay at the Hotel 1898 again.

However, the reviews on this website scared me away, and led me to Hotel 1898. As usual, tripadvisor members steered me well! And, after walking into the lobby of the neighboring Le Meridien, I am SO GLAD I stayed at 1898. The people who work at the front desk could not be nicer or more eager to assist with any and all requests...they speak perfect English, and the lobby (an anomaly in today's travel) is actually comfortable and useful as a place to sit if you are just looking for a place to relax and wind down after a busy day. The rooms are comfortable--the furniture is nice, the colors soothing, and the beds comfortable. The free internet is much appreciated, and the amenities go beyond the usual and are very nice (we LOVE the embossed slippers). The showers are great--always hot water with good pressure...this, too, was much appreciated! The rooftop pool is wonderful, with great views, and the basement pool is even nicer--soothing, and dark, and quiet. Very romantic. The workout area is minimal, but they try, which is appreciated. I agree with everyone's comments about the hotel's restaurant--it's the only drawback to an otherwise wonderful hotel. The people who work there are indifferent and a little rude, (the place was completely empty at 8:30 on a Tuesday night...which pretty much tells you everything you need to know about it), and the prices are ridiculous for a very average meal. Also, since they are right above the subway, the floor and tables in the front of the restaurant actually shake every 7-8 minutes as the trains go by. If they could get a decent restaurant into this hotel, with prices to match, they would have a goldmine. The location of this hotel is the best we could have imagined...literally only a few steps from Las Ramblas. Great restaurants and shopping are all within walking distance, and the front desk will sell you a discounted coupon booklet for the hop on-hop off bus tour. It's a great way to see the city, and to save a couple of Euro. There are literally dozens of restaurants in walking distance---if you go out to Las Ramblas and walk to the right, there is a great market selling fresh fish (including lobsters and crabs that are still alive), fruit, snacks, and drinks. They also have a couple of stands selling sangria that are fun. If you go out to Las Ramblas and walk to the left, there is a pizza place that is good, and a little middle eastern place called Pita Inn that sells gyros--delicious food for less than 10 euro. (In Pita Inn, sit upstairs---it's about 20 degree cooler up there!) The shopping in the middle of the street is \"ok,\" but there is a grocery store (also to the left once you hit the main street) that sells wine, chocolates, souvenirs, etc. It's usually crowded, but they have a lot of registers open, and most people are only buying a couple of things so they move quickly. It's a great place to buy some fruit, pastries, etc for the mornings.

Its two main good points are its excellent location and the comfortable rooms. Service is okay -- not bad, not great. The biggest downfall is the high pricetag (we paid 200Euro/night b/c we got a major discount, and it still felt a bit too high). We had the smallest room type -- it had a king bed, a desk with chair and an armoire with a few hangers and no shelves for our clothes -- the room did not have enough space for a comfy chair or any other furniture. Our window looked out into an interior courtyard that was decorated nicely with plants and stones. Our bathroom was pretty large, with an extra deep tub, which was a nice touch. We spent several afternoons at the pool on the roof, which is nice. There are some areas to sit with shade and some in the sun. The food on the roof is also very expensive. On the first day we ordered a chicken and shrimp dish for 8.5Euro and it was one kabob with 3 small pieces of chicken and 2 small shrimp. The next day we brought sandwiches up with us, but were told that we weren't allowed to bring our own food. They later recanted, saying it was okay to eat our sandwiches on that day only, but not in the future -- it simply didn't seem very friendly. Another odd service issue happened one day when we got back to the room midafternoon and the housekeeping staff was in it cleaning -- she didn't offer to leave and come back later, or say that she'd be done in just a minute. She didn't actually say anything. We thought that was a bit strange -- we understand basic Spanish and could have understood her -- we were tired and wanted to rest, but didn't feel like we really could b/c we weren't sure how long she'd be there or what her plan was. Other service situations went perfectly well -- while our room wasn't available when we first arrived from the airport (around 10am) -- there was one available after we returned from breakfast an hour later. And the desk was happy to arrange for a taxi to the airport for us, help us with our bags, etc. So, while the stay was generally nice and the location right on La Rambla excellent, we just felt like it was a bit pricey for the service. We chose not to eat at the hotel restaurant for dinner b/c there are a myriad of good food options within a short walk, including for breakfast. Coming from a country where there's no good coffee -- we were delighted to find a coffee shop right next door to the hotel. I would recommend the Hotel 1898 to friends with the caveat that price be no object, and that the location be more important than the service.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cSo nearly Perfect\u201d", "Author": "Booozo", "ReviewID": "UR76988100", "Content": "In a nutshell, we've stayed before and I can't wait to go back!

First, I will say that I wasn't paying attention when booking the location on this hotel--right in the middle of the tourist trap circus of Las Ramblas. We typically stay in a quieter location off of the beaten path and are much happier to visit touristy places and then venture back to peace and quiet. So, be prepared to be confronted with crowds, hasselers, prostitutes, etc, etc. when you exit this hotel. That being said, it was easy for us to stay in the hotel instead of to enjoy the sights of Barcelona (which is what we typically do). Really there's no amenity the hotel does not offer. The lobby is amazing and the archetecture impressive. The rooms are beautiful and the bathrooms are posh. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. The hotel's rooftop is amazing...cushioned benches/chairs/lounges all around with a nice pool, bar and amazing views. We ate breakfast up here both mornings and the breakfast was amazing. The basement of the hotel houses a spa and a beautiful spa pool, sauna and steam room. Its beautiful. So, if you go to Hotel 1898, go for the amenities and be prepared for not wanting to leave...also be prepared for staff to not go out of their way to welcome you. Staff was not AT ALL rude, but unfriendly, curt and, at times, slightly condescending. But coming from the South of Spain to Barcelona, I found this attitude common among most in the city (aka the taxi driver who attempted to swindle us). You will find the complete opposite in the South of Spain and I would return there, I will never return to Barcelona. Definitely eat the breakfast on the rooftop terrace. It may seem overpriced at just under 30 euro, but so worth it. You are served a huge amount of really good food and the women who serve it are much nicer, warmer and friendlier than any other staff I encountered at the hotel. Eating breakfast on the rooftop and strolling over to the pool was a great way to start 2 mornings. DO NOT eat at the restaurant on floor 1. The portions and the prices are laughable and the service is horrible. Instead go around the corner to Bar Lobo for AMAZING tapas and good service and value.

While tired from traveling and not sure we were ready to do another quick city, we could not have been more pleased with Hotel 1898. It's in a great location, right off Las Ramblas toward the north end, so great for walking, people watching, and visiting some of the fabulous historic sites of Barcelona such as the Gothic area. The hotel is very dark in decor but in a hip and cool style. It's actually a very soothing place to hang out after the hustle and bustle on the streets. Friendly, helpful staff; the room was on the smaller side but it had everything we needed: great linens, very quiet, nice bath, flat screen TV; high tech room control lighting. I was concerned about being so close to the craziness on Las Ramblas but Hotel 1898 was very quiet. The hotel also had free internet service available for guests in their Library which is huge if you're not traveling with a laptop. There is a rooftop pool and bar which offers great city views; and, a Spa and workout area located on the lower floor. We had a drink in the bar one evening and that was fine. If I had to pick something negative, it would be the breakfast. While they put out a fabulous buffet priced around $25 Euros per person, I wish they offered an a la carte choice. I don't want to eat $25E worth of food in the morning. So if you wanted something simple, you either had to do Room Service or go elsewhere. Also, be careful with the cabs. We had a cab ride from the airport to the hotel in the middle of the day - $24E total and the ride took about 35 minutes because of traffic. No problem there. Then we had the front desk arrange for a cab to take us back to the airport, at 6:15 a.m. on our departure morning. We were in the lobby checking out at 6am; the bellman took our bags out to the cab. We were in the cab and on the road by 6:15 a.m. When we arrived at the airport which only took 15 minutes because of the early morning and no traffic, the fare read $28 E and then he charged us an additional $10 E because he said he had to wait for us to come out of the hotel. We felt stuck; tried to discuss the matter but he put up the \"I don't speak English\" wall. So we paid the money and he left. It was the only time in our 13 day trip where we felt we got ripped off. So, the bottom line is - ask what the fare is going to be before you get into the cab. They can give you an approximate amount. And in fairness, the hotel told me that the cab driver would charge us an additional $10E if we were not ready and on the road by the scheduled time. So, we left Hotel 1898 on a negative.

With a room on the interior court and a secure elevator once you are inside you would never know that just outside your door you would be on the busiest street in Spain and blocks from the Gothic City. The room was small, but probably normal by European standards. Do look at the carefully written and clear instructions written in multiple languages (including English) on how to operate the shower before you attempt to use it. We found it a great way to transition from the US to Spanish culture was spending an hour in the evening enjoying the complimentary tea (when we got back to the hotel on time) and then another hour resting our tired feet and bodies in the pool and sauna and getting ready for a late (9-10 pm) dinner. The hotel's best feature was perhaps the SPA where the pool, sauna and steam room are available to guests. We did not have the time or budget for SPA services on this trip, but based on the set up and complimentary services available, we wished we had had an opportunity to try them. There was also a roof-top pool which has a great view and looked inviting but it was a little too cool during our visit to use it. The buffet breakfast was complete and you could ask for eggs done as you like them, which is a feature that we as vegetarians appreciated in meat-crazy and ham-crazy Spain. We knew at every breakfast that we could eat according to our dietary preference plus enjoy whatever extra goodies the hotel offered. The fruit offered in May was ripe, sweet and plentiful. Don't overlook the macadamia nuts. (In booking our room we mistakenly booked for one person instead of two but the hotel graciously provided us a second breakfast at the same unit price that we could have secured had we booked properly.) We had no problem in communicating with the front desk, even though we have no Spanish or Catalan language skills. There always was someone at the desk who spoke English and there was at least one native English speaker (from London). But, there is no separate concierge. The folks at the front desk do it all themselves. Though this may make for a more interesting job, it may not be the best way to help travelers. As with other hotels and tourist offices in Spain, we found it difficult to get a solid recommendation from the advisors at the front desk. The options available for tour guides, etc. were quite costly. There seemed to be few group tours of any kind available except standard, touristy bus tours.

We chose the hotel because of the spa and the lovely decor. The staff was happy to situate my room close to my daughter's room on the 3rd floor. At first glance I thought the room was small. My room faced a small interior courtyard, so no view, but the design of the room was so nice, and although the bed felt hard, it actually ended up being super comfortable. The spa and small pool was such a great treat at the end of the day. The girls had massages and loved them. We had tapas the first afternoon in the restaurant, which was not so memorable. The really remarkable thing about the hotel's location is how close it is to The Bocaria...huge covered market, not even a block away. Take a seat at one of the counters at the little market restaurant stalls ( my favorite was in the back ) and you will have the most delicious, fresh, Catalonian lunch!! Fish, razor clams, mussels, sausages, beef, rice...unbelievable! I also stopped there in the morning for fresh juice, and fruit sold wrapped up with a tiny fork. The coconut juice was my son's favorite! Staying on the Ramblas is a mixed bag. There are some shady pick-pocket types around and the touristy souvenir stands make you think you're cluelessly staying in Barcelona's version of Times Square, but I think the benefits out-weighed the negatives. Barcelona is very easily walkable and the hotel in a short few steps to the beautiful Gothic area and a reasonable walk to many of the Gaudi sites. The subway system is a few blocks up the street from the hotel, as is the big department store. The subway is clean and safe, and easy to understand. Take it to the Miro museum. It was worth the trip and had a lovely view of the city! Then go back to the hotel and splash in the pool. I wish the weather had been warmer because the rooftop deck and pool looked wonderful!

I did quite a bit of research and figured that eventually I would have to make a decision so I just kind of went with 1898. I am now convinced that if anyone had a problem with this hotel it is because they are problematic themselves. Checking in & out was a breeze. We had requested a double bed (\"matrimonial\") but were a little concerned that they couldn't guarantee it. Just make sure to call in advance and have them make a note of it - email them as well to follow up with your request. The room was ample and the design very beautiful. I'm sure that there are other hotels that are a bit under this price range (we paid an average of EUR225 per night) that would have been great as well but my boyfriend has already said that this is where we will stay when we return to BCN for another vacation. It is very central on La Rambla. We stayed in Rm 444, which has a small balcony and looks directly out over La Rambla. I didn't have the same issue with noise on that side of the hotel. The windows are double-paned which helps reduce the sound. Aside from that we were usually so exhausted from sight-seeing and running all over the place for an entire day that by the time we settled in for the night it would have been difficult to disturb us. The hotel restaurant is fine - certainly pricey, but the food was wonderful. Less than a block away to the right of the hotel (if you are facing the main entrance) is a great grocery store called Carrefour Express. Definitely stock up on basics like water, snacks, milk or cream for coffee. There is a very small refrigerator in the room and an electric kettle to heat water for the instant coffee they provide in the room. They don't provide enough creamer for my taste, so I got a small amount of milk to hold me over for the week. The walk to Barceloneta is about 10 minutes, and if you go in the opposite direction, you're at Plaza Catalunya in under 5 minutes. There is tons of shopping close-by and metro stations all around - about 4 within a 5-8 minute walk. Barri Gotic basically starts on the other side of La Rambla from 1898. Just walk through one of the smaller side streets. If you take Carrer de la Portaferrissa and just keep walking straight, you'll get to see lots of small stores and then you'll come up onto the absolutely gorgeous Cathedral of Barcelona. Be sure to go to the hotel's terrace which has excellent views of the cathedral and other wonderful landmarks. This trip was fantastic. Our stay at Hotel 1898 set a wonderful foundation for a great weeklong adventure and we'll definitely be staying here again and suggesting it to anyone else that will be going to BCN. One other point that was very interesting...if you are facing La Rambla from the hotel (with your back to the hotel), look to the left and you will see a building with a large blue sign that says Citadines - it is bldg #122. There is a breezeway/alley on the ground floor you can walk through to see the Roman Necropolis - a small bit of land that has been preserved with ancient Roman tombs that were uncovered (in the 1950s, I believe) while the block was undergoing construction. There are lots of areas close to the hotel with very interesting history.

The Metro was nearby as were the sidestreets to the gothic area and even a Citibank ATM. When booking a room, however - be sure to ask for a room not affected by subway rumbling (I think we were on the fifth floor and heard it). Granted, the rumbling ceases at about midnight but it can be a nuisance if you're a light/early sleeper. I would also advise that staying on La Rambla is a little bit 'touristy' since it attracts people the same way Times Square does in New York.

The proximity to The Boqueria was the clincher over Hotel Omm (a trendier option if thats what you are looking for). We had two of our best meals in the Boqueria (one breakfast and one lunch) and were psyched to be only 2 blocks from it. Contrary to many of the reviews on this site, I did not hear ANY noise from our room at night and we slept soundly. The rooms were clean (housekeeping does a great job maintaining the property), roomy and the bathroom was nice (granite, towl heater, badet, etc). We highly recommend upgrading to a deluxe room for the 100+ sq ft terrace. We also found the concierge to be very helpful in assisting us with our New Year's plans before we arrived and we also asked them to make a dinner reccomendation for us that turned out to be surprisingly good (El Pintor) though a little pricey for what it was (to be expected in a touristy area). The hotel is a few blocks from notable sightseeing including the Gothic Quarter, Picasso musuem and stops for both the red and blue line buses (see below). The only negatives were the lack of irons in the rooms (though we never really needed them) and our king bed which was actually two twins put togther but not connected (if you toss and turn they will move apart since the floors are hardwood). We didnt have time to test out the Spa or the restaurant on premisis. For context, this is a good 4 star property. Some other things to note: - Use the red and blue line buses to see the city. You can hop on and off at any of the stops and they go everywhere for just 21 euros a person. -Eat breakfast at the Boqueria. The tapas counter right at the entrance has amazing omelets, chick peas and churros. -Get to the Sagrada Familia early or you will end up in a 3hr+ line to get inside. -A number of the highly rated restaurants we wanted to try were closed for the holiday through Jan 4th. -Take taxis late night... we had a couple in our group get mugged on their way to the Metro a few blocks outside of Club Shoko.

They have a roof top pool and there are great views of the city from up there. There is an amazing grotto type pool in the gym area and a few cardio machines. The sauna and steam room are nice, but the sauna was not hot enough for me. It is all co-ed so you need to bring a swim suit.

A sign of a good hotel- they had a mega magnifying mirror in the bathroom. They also had a towel warmer which I love because of hot towels but you can also dry clothes on it. Ok, so I really liked it and I would go back.

It felt like walking into another time. If there was one word to describe the hotel's decor, it would be \"classy\". Our room was not huge, which we expected in Europe, but had a beautiful terrace with a table and chairs. The room had very high ceilings, and all the amenities you expect from a top hotel. We loved that the Internet was fee too, something that's not offered so many hotels in Europe. The facilities are all world-class. There is a beautiful lobby with plenty of sofas that you will always find a place to relax. Besides the lobby is another lounge area with more sitting areas. There is also a wonderful bar and restaurant on the ground level that is perfect for late evening drinks. The hotel also has an amazing roof-top terrace that serves beautiful tapas and from which you can view practically the whole city. There is also a pool on the roof as well as in the basement, both not huge, but very nice and unique. The pool in the basement has a lovely cavernous feel. In fact, this whole hotel was very romantic. The location of Hotel 1898 cannot be beat. It is right on La Rambla, a very beautiful street full of life, shops, cafes, and street entertainers. It is also right in the Gothic Quarter, within walking distance to the Gothic Cathedral. In fact, we took a stroll down those beautiful narrow old Barcelona streets and stumbled onto the cathedral and a little further down, the Picasso Museum. It's definitely ideally situated if you're the type that likes to walk around a new city and see things as you go. There is also a very high-class Chinese restaurant attached to the hotel that seemed very popular with the locals. We didn't eat there, but it looked very nice. Behind the hotel, however, is a wonderful tapas cafe that we did eat at, and it was great. Again, very popular with the locals. There is also a business center with PCs and Internet access for free, as well as free printing, which was very handy when we planned our days and also printing our e-tickets for our flight after Barcelona. Overall, this was a fantastic hotel which wasn't too expensive, and better than all the other hotels that we walked past on La Rambla, including Hotel Montecarlo, Hotel Murmuri, and the Le Meridien, which was just across the street from Hotel 1898 and completely dead.

On the minus side, we had problems with the amount of storage space available in our 'classic' room (and we only had one hand-luggage sized suitcase each!) and the main 'minus' for us was the attitude of the hotel staff (apart from the cleaners, who were lovely). On the one hand, they were very helpful when approached, very professional and efficient. But no-one we spoke to in the bars or at reception was anything above civil. We were hard presed to get a smile from anyone, attempts to engage in conversation with the bar staff were rebuffed and generally we felt that their approach to guests was quite clinical.

Thankfully the Spanish eat their evening meals much later than we do in UK - it wasn't until much later that evening I felt like eating again....

Its location makes it an ideal spot to start your Barcelona adventures. Beautiful, classy rooms and public areas: We booked one of the smallest rooms (because the hotel rates are not really cheap and you really don't need all that much space, but more important, they are facing the patio, and as a result you don't hear the noise from the streets). Halls, stairwell and other areas are very nicely styled in the same manner as the rest of the hotel. Great breakfast buffet: all you need and all you can eat and/or drink Ideal roof top terrace: very nice to relax after sightseeing. Lie in the sun, take a dip in the pool, or just hang out on the lounge type furniture Nothing negative to report? Well, it's pricey (but I guess not much different from other 4/5-star hotels in other places and centrally located). We arrived in the evening and ordered some tapas and drinks on the rooftop terrace, and it cost us EUR 70. A glass of wine will cost you EUR 7,50, soft drinks EUR 5 or 6 per glass, a Mojito EUR 14 and you are not allowed to take food or beverages with you to the rooftop terrace. A nice alternative if you're lazy (or just tired after walking around the city) is a small tapas bar on the corner 50m down the street of the main entrance of the hotel (not the entrance on the Ramblas). Other nice to knows: there's a Carrefour Express (small supermarket) on the Ramblas, located 100m from the hotel, a Starbuck's next to the Ramblas entry and a Market somewhat further down the Ramblas, ideal material for photographers). General warning: do watch out for pickpockets and bagthieves. In our last 24 hours we actually witnessed one robbery taking place at a traffic light, saw the aftermath of one and were told by another hotel guest she and her husband were robbed the day before. Do not get distracted (it usually always starts with an innocent looking distraction) , leave your passport and one credit card in the hotel safe, don't carry all of your money in your wallet/bag (and definitly not your home adress), put money in various places, and always keep your bag in front of you or tight between your arm and upper body!!!", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, ny", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay - great hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "2007bride", "ReviewID": "UR44290973", "Content": "We really enjoyed this hotel.

The 1898 was miles better. It's 160+ rooms are recently (2005) refurbished, it commands a good location, and offers most creature comforts. Here are a few minor areas which could be improved: (1) many rooms are quite small, and despite the hotel's claims that rooms were specially soundproofed (100% wooden floors certainly do not help here), noise levels from adjacent rooms and corridors can be substantial, (2) shower water temperature can take a while to regulate. (3) aircon controls were inside an inadequately-lit cupboard, though still easy to operate. (4) lights are operated by a chip in the room key, so at noon on your checkout day the lights can go out as you're packing. This is a problem if, like us, you have one of the standard rooms facing into one of two tight courtyards. Whilst these are quieter (no street noise), they lack sufficient natural light. Here's a longer list of what's really, really good: (1) Rooms are very well lit (spotlights/lamps with four \"mood settings\") (2) Built in safes (not standard in all 4star hotels in Barcelona) (3) Electric kettles and tea/coffee provided in rooms (4) A leaflet encourages guests to choose from a pillow menu (see photo) (5) Mattresses are firm, cotton sheets have hi quality feel, towels/robes seem new (6) Decent selection of programmes on sharp flatscreen LCD TVs (7) Aircon works efficiently (digital thermostat plus Hi/Lo sessing), and is silent and odorless (8) Convenient to have both overhead 'rain shower head' and a hand shower (but no bidet) (9) Basement spa area (sauna,steam,pool), whilst small, is clean and rarely busy (10) Reception staff are well trained, responsive and speak good english (11) Rooftop terrace spans the entire footprint of the building... very large chillout/tanning area, and mostly overlooked by .. nobody. (12) Whilst shallow, rooftop pool is large enough for a few strokes each way (13) Views from rooftop are virtually uninterrupted (only Sagrada Familia is not visible) (14) Four PCs/internet available 24h for guest use in common area, one with printer (15) Free wireless broadband in all rooms (16) Breakfast buffet better than most hotels of similar standard in BCN, choice of filter coffee or self-service Nespresso machine at breakfast, and made-to-order eggs (ours were perfect) (17) Unusually high ceilings on all floors add feel of sophistication (18) Lobby area is a well-cooled haven from the summer heat (19) Location is exceptional ... directly on the Ramblas, one block from fruit market, big Carrefour next door, Plaza Catalunya just 250 paces away, old town & Cathedral very close, two metro stations (Liceu,PC) visible when you step outside the hotel ... this is probably the optimal spot to be as a tourist.", "Date": "July 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, so-so standard rooms\u201d", "Author": "john_matrix", "ReviewID": "UR35575469", "Content": "The good: -Great location (although la rambla is not a very enjoyable place) -Wonderful roof terrace with pool where many hours were spent just relaxing and enjoying the wonderful view -Great spa section -Nice decor and botique feel -Great breakfast - we found out that the epress breakfast at the hotel (~10eur) was much better than Lobo's breakfast. The bad was unfortunately our room (standard room): - It was way too dark - almost no daylight flowing in (the room was on the 2nd floor facing the other parts of the hotel building), and with only spotlights designed to keep the room fancy but dark. So it was not really enjoyable hanging out in the room and there was no way to tell the outside weather. Felt a bit like a basement room.. -The bed consisted of two cheap-feeling small beds with wheels which where pushed together to form a twin-bed, but which came apart as soon as one moved due to the wheels. I.e. no way to sleep next to one another.. I guess we just had bad luck and that they don't have the same beds in every room given that no one else seems to complain about the beds.. -Although the room was soundproofed so you did not hear other rooms, you did hear every little thing coming from outside your door, which included all the noise the cleaners made when they started their work early in the morning. On our floor there was also some sort of conference room which meant that a lot of people who did not stay at the hotel were passing our door and making noise in the evening.. -Small room which basically only had rooms for the beds and a table and our luggage.. But not a big problem.. If we would have stayed at the hotel during a colder period and would have liked to spend more time in the room I would not stay at this hotel (at least not in the standard rooms) and would probably give it a lower rating. But since it was summer and we spent most of our hotel-time at the incredible roof terrace, I have to give it a 4. If the room had been better I'd give it a 5. I think the price was rather good for the overall experience and the location. Oh and P.S, I left behind a sweater at the roof terrace one day and when I went back to retrieve it a couple of hours later it was mysterously gone and never again found. It's so strange, because I'm 100% positive I left it there and all the other guests seemed like nice & honest people, so I cannot figure out who could have taken it...

Second, the decor and design really blew us away - the late 19th century tobacco plantation theme is carried through every single detail.

This all boils down to the fact that the sound isolation in the Hotel may need some improvement.

We had no problems with the petty crime that Barcelona seems to be associated with and the location provides plenty of choice for eating, drinking and sight seeing. It was the perfect location for us. The hotel itself was peaceful and relaxing and the lounge area by the bar was a great place to enjoy the complementary afternoon tea and biscuits after a hectic day of sightseeing. The spa area and indoor pool with it's multi jet massagers was also ideal for unwinding before going out again later in the evening ( many restaurants don't seem to get going much before about 9 pm) and was never busy. Staff in all areas of the hotel were always friendly,professional and polite. We had a superior room with a small Juliette balcony overlooking a square to the rear of the hotel. This is a lively square with good bars and restaurants frequented by many locals as well as tourists and we could certainly feel the buzz of the city by being able to stand and watch all that went on there. However, come night time, good double glazing made sure that we heard nothing from it and come the morning we were down there having our breakfast in Bar Lobo which offered a great choice in a great location for a great price. Definitely better value than the hotel breakfast at 20 euros per person.

We were looking for comfort, style and a convenient location in Barcelona. I had phoned the hotel about a month in advance to let them know that our Delta flight would be arriving at 8am, well before check-in, and asked them to accommodate us. The second person I spoke with assured me it would be no problem. When we arrived we were told there was no way we could check in early and were basically told to amuse ourselves for three hours. We were not offered breakfast or even coffee - nothing. We sat in the lobby then moved to the rooftop when it opened, where we were simply ignored. You can't get just coffee up there, they make you order a very expensive full meal or nothing. Our first day, the room was cleaned TWICE, which is great in a hotel of this caliber - I mean, we paid about $300 a night. The second day, the room was not even cleaned once, we arrived back at 7pm to no towels or clean sheets. We were not given an apology, just a lame excuse and not a very polite one at that. This time I said, \"so, can you maybe buy us a drink or something so we have something to do while you clean our room?\" We were given a voucher for the rooftop, which is indeed a nice place to hang out. But I would definitely characterize the staff as less than pleasant, especially when compared to most people in Barcelona, who are generally very kind and friendly to foreigners who are cool to them. Our room itself was comfortable, but yes, the Rambla is EXTREMELY noisy. Please don't delude yourselves folks, even if the bars close at 3am the noise continues until dawn EVERY NIGHT (we were on the 4th floor and it actually kept us up even with the windows closed). If you are the partying kind it may be just the thing you want but we didn't dig it at all. Very popular hangout for football hooligan-types of every nationality. Also, the street is sprinkled with shady types and street kids, BE AWARE. The market is lovely, get your breakfast there instead of paying 22 euros (as of this writing, about 30 dollars) for a relatively decent breakfast. Loved the electric kettles in the rooms and the complementary tea and coffee. We are an adventurous, but not ultra-partying couple in our 40s who came for the art, food and beautiful architecture.

I asked for one of their larger Classic (Standard) rooms & was told that there was one on the 3rd floor, but we would have to come back at 3 pm. They stored our luggage & told us that we could relax on the roof which had plenty of comfortable places to rest with a bar, pool & a nice view of the city. Drinks are expensive. We decided to check out La Ramblas which is right out the door of the hotel. La Boqueria is a short walk down the street. Lots to see & do as soon as you leave the hotel. Perfect location! When we got back we were a little disappointed because if this was one of their larger rooms, I would hate to be stuck in their smaller rooms. The bed was 2 beds pushed together, but it was perfectly fine & comfortable. There was a desk/chair, bench to put our luggage on, a small stuffed chair with glass table, a flat screen TV & a closet with a kettle/cups & instant coffee & tea. There was a mini bar & an in-room safe. For 3 days we had trouble with that safe. The first time we could not get it open & we had to wait for the front desk to send someone up to open it so we could get our cash/camera. We were told that it was the battery & they replaced it & we were finally able to get our cash/camera to go sightseeing. Unfortunately, the same thing happened the next morning when we were ready to go out for the day. Again, they sent someone up & they had trouble opening it & told us we could leave & they would get it open...huh, leave without our money/camera!!! They again got it open & said maintenance would be up, but suggested we put our stuff in the lock box in back of the front desk. I told them one of the reasons we picked Hotel 1898 was that we had a safe in the room. Again, they said it was fixed, but again the same thing happened. I put some of our cash/valuables in the lock box, but after the 3rd time was afraid to lock things in the in-room safe since we wasted so much of our time trying to get someone to either open or close it. No one from management suggested they replace the in-room safe or find us another room...frustrating! Also, the night before we were to leave we asked for a wake-up call for 6 am....no call & luckily one of us was up by 6:20 am. When we told them we did not get the call, they said it was automatic. I saw the girl write it in a book. I did not think that they should question us..why would we say we did not get the call??? There was no clock in the room. The bathroom was beautiful..all green marble & plenty of hot water. The towels were very large & thick & robes & slippers are provided. Also, the toiletries were about the best we have gotten in Europe, shampoo, body wash, body lotion, small bar of soap, comb, razor/cream, toothbrushes/small toothpaste, shoe shine sponge & cotton balls & Q-tips....nice! The spa area is lovely with a nice pool. Even if you don't use their spa services check out the grotto-like pool area. They have turn down service with chocolates with nuts. The bar area is nice & comfortable. I liked the fact that we had to use our key in the elevator to go upstairs to our room. The TV had very little programs in English. There was only 1 small drawer & that drawer did not open completely. All & all this is a lovely hotel in a great location for sightseeing.

We had two rooms, one in the front and one in the back over a small tapas restaurant in the street below. It is an excellent location, right on the Ramblas. The hotel windows are tight enough that the street noises were not a problem. The mattress and pillows and sheets were top notch. The staff was friendly and professional. there were a few concerns or peculiarities that are worth mentioning. First, when I asked for an iron and board the staff told me \"this isn't allowed in hotels in Spain\" - that was a bogus excuse - we easily got irons and boards in other hotels we stayed and hotels that were a great deal older than the 1898. Second, they accepted 3 reservations for spa services and just before we arrived they announced that the pool and spa area was going to go under some maintenance. We arrived for the services, thinking that the maintenance would be over, but even in the early evening it was impossible to have relaxing services. Fortunately the spa person suggested we not try to go ahead with the service. The hotel should have had the courtesy to cancel us and offer another session time or at least a complimentary hotel service in exchange for not being able to meet our reservation and our expectation after a long trans-atlantic flight. AND we were not able to use these services that were part of the hotel amenities and there was no discount or compiimentary service in exchange. Finally, when we departed the front desk screwed up on a mini-bar charge that was their screw-up. We had already checked out with a sizable bill for 2 rooms on a credit card and the front desk wanted us to cough up $10 cash to settle their mistake. The front desk should have had enough discretion to drop the issue and take the less than $10 \"hit\" that was of their own making. The poor front desk guy was absolutely in fear of the manager not accepting his mistake and that I should be sure and take care of it. Again, the hotel should have just said \"sorry for even this inconvenience and here is a bottle of Spanish olive oil or wine for your time\". Those negatives were just unprofessional for a hotel that should be top notch. Final note - don't be tricked by the beautiful photo of the rooftop pool. It was a soaking area - probably not more than 4' deep and not more than 12' x 24' or smaller. Anyway, there is no way you do anything but cool down from a break in the sun and the water is warm. We were under the impression from the photos that we could at least stretch our bodies in the pool and that was impossible.

I find this most strange in all the establishments I have stayed in I have often had afternoon tea or a coffee in the afternoons,let alone a coffee with breakfast yet this is something they could not offer.

As it turned out it was better than we expected. Definately more 5 star than 4 star for us and we have travelled the world staying in top places i.e. Raffles Singapore, Sandy Lane Barbados, Dorchester, Berkely Hotel London. The trip was a last minute thing as we live in Spain and were going to see a group (The Killers) in Barcelona so could drive to see the show. It would take about an hour and a half each way so as it was also my birthday over the weekend we decided to stay a few days and are really glad we did. We arrived, checked in (reception very good and all speak English if your Spanish isnt too good) and then we were shown where to park. A strange feeling being walked by a porter infront of the car down the road through some cafes in a side street and down to the underground parking. Definately worth it. Secure, really clean and only about 20 euros a day with direct lift access from the lobby. The room was great. A superior room overlooking the Ramblas. Great until nightfall when the noise did permiate the room, carried on all night and left us knackered for the day. But the reception moved us to a (smaller) side room and we slept like babies the whole stay. Interesting that noise from the metro on the Rambla side also disappeared with the side street room. The hotel restaurant is good but a little lacking in atmosphere. Ok for breakfast though. The breakfasts are good but expensive so on our next visit we are going to go out for breakfast as due to the fantastic location of the Hotel there are many good places to eat. Cafe Lobo at the rear of the hotel is good for food and coffees. Whilst there we had lunch at the Hotel Arts as it was a hotel we were considering but it is not a patch on the Hotel 1898. It looks tired and shabby. We went on the tour bus and would throughly recommend it. Very interesting, clean, good sound on the headphones and value for money. The Chinese restaurant next door is a must. We went there twice as it was the best chinese food we had eaten. A restaurant recommended by another Trip Advisor - a fish restaurant , one of the oldest and most popular in Barcelona, was a major disappointment. The food was good but over the top price wise and also we had the most arrogant waiter I have ever come across. Everything was too much trouble for him, he confused our order and some other diners and also had a habit of slurping out of a bottle under the serving counter when he thought noone was looking. We were sat up in the gallery so if you do go dont sit in that area in case that is his permanent patch. A taxi to the restaurant was double the price of the one coming back so we think we were ripped off so the tip is always get the price of the trip when you get in or from the hotel reception if you go direct from the hotel. Also the spa and roof top area is just the most relaxing place to be after walking round the town. We always seemed to go when noone else was in the pool so were spoilt. On the safety angle for Barcelona we had read reports of 'watch out' but honestly we felt very safe. Obviously it is good to take care and not flash your wallet or probably even take a handbag purely because it is a large city and you can get distracted.

Having spent over 1400 Euros on 5 nights in the H 1898 hotel. This averages out to 280 Euros or approx \u00a3255 per night (room only, breakfast is an additional 20 Euros each). First the good news: the position of this hotel, slap bang in the middle of La Ramblas is perfect, the decor of the hotel is also quite superb. Sadly, things go downhill once you get to your room. Beware: we paid extra for a 'superior' room, the difference between a 'classic' room and a 'superior' room is the view (\"of Barcelona's bustling streets\" - according to the website). Our view was of a wall. A wall. We paid extra for a view of a wall. When we queried this we were told that we could upgrade to another room, they'd just check the additional cost that we would have to pay..................... The decor (and also the lighting) of the room is excellent, sadly the services were not. The quality of the TV & Wi-Fi reception was poor. The room (for this amount of money - after having stayed in 4 and 5* hotels all over the world) was small, as was the bathroom. We had to remind them at 17.00 hrs, on our return one evening that we would like the room cleaned; the soap in the bathroom wasn't replaced for three days; and the towels weren't replaced. The roof-top swimming pool area is a wonderful chill-out spot after a hard day shopping / sight seeing, but why are there are no changing / toilet facilities? Guest have to get changed in their rooms and then take the lift (only 1 in 3 goes to the roof) in their 'cossies'. Barcelona is a fabulous city.

I booked 2 superior rooms and 1 lux room. I requested the the rooms be off the ramblas and that the lux room have feather pillows instead of synthetic. We arrived early on check in day and our taxis were met by a very helpful bellman who ran to get a cart and whisked our luggage away. The front desk staff were very pleasant and confirmed that the lux room did, indeed, have feather pillows. The lobby was stunning! All black and white and leather! Just beautiful! We all went to our respective rooms and were very pleased. They have a red scheme and a black scheme and both are very nice. The lux room had a huge balcony (though the view of surrounding rundown bldgs was not exactly picturesque). We had had a long train ride from France and were very hungry. The front desk recommended a tapas place within walking distance. It was excellent. I wish I could remember the name...We returned to the hotel and a few of the party tried the pool facilities while the rest of us headed to the bar to relax and play cards. The bar was fantastic! Even though we were stuffed from our tapas lunch, they had a free offering of sandwiches and sweets. The drinks were lovely and potato chips and peanuts appeared with the most adorable little black cocktail napkins. The bartender was not intrusive but still attentive. The feedback of the pool facilities were also very good. We retired to our rooms and indulged in room service for the night. The food was fine, not great. We breakfasted at the hotel the next morning...excellent spread! It was so nice to return to the calmness of the hotel after a busy day of sightseeing. All in all our 2 night stay was very nice. A few minor areas that could be improved, and I'm being picky...1) We had massages and, as I was 7.5 months pregnant at the time, I wanted to make sure that they could do a prenatal massage. They said not a problem, but the massage therapist obviously had not done prenatal massage before..it was fine, but I wish they would have let me know that they were making it up as they went along beforehand 2) during our massage, a group of children decided to make use of the pool. I don't think they had adult supervision (or not adequate if so) and make quite a bit of noise. As the massage therapists also do double duty as the spa receptionist, there was no one to tell them to quiet down 3) My father reported back that one of his encounters with the front desk staff was less than satisfactory. Apparently, he asked her a question and she couldn't be bothered. She waved him off, left and he had to wait for the next staff person to surface.

We grabbed a taxi from the taxi stand outside the arrivals gate area. The trip cost us around 30 euros. We also took a taxi back to the airport when leaving and the price was the same. On our first trip to Barcelona we arrived in Girona with Ryan Air so had used their bus service to get to the city. For transportation for the rest of the trip we walked mostly. Neighborhood The hotel is on La Rambla and is in a very active area although from our room we couldn\u2019t here any street noise. There is plenty of shopping around the hotel so it made it easy to get water, drinks, cash, etc. We found La Rambla to be busy during the day and really busy during the night. There are people there trying to sell you stuff and approaching you \u2013 some are there to sell you drugs. While my boyfriend was having a cigarette on La Rambla outside the hotel \u2013 a prostitute did approach him. There is another entrance to the hotel on a side street where you can stand and avoid the crowd of La Rambla. Overall, the location was good and convenient. Room (photos included) We had a Classic room and our rate was \u20ac180 each night (not including breakfast). We booked the hotel through the hotel website. The room was a good size which had a huge comfortable bed, a desk, 2 chairs, a wardrobe (a safe inside) and a mini bar fridge. There was a bench to put your luggage on and a huge flat screen TV in front of the bed. There were quite a few English channels but the reception was poor. The view from the window was nothing special but enough for some natural light in the morning. A unique feature was that it had different light settings where you could press a button for the mood you wanted to set in the room (for example: reading, watching tv, night, welcome). We found it easier than adjusting all the lamps. Bathroom (photos included) The bathroom was very spacious. There was a window in the bathroom to let in some natural light. There was a separate shower stall in addition to the tub/shower combination. However, the shower stall had no light inside. It was dark inside the stall even with the bathroom lights on. We looked at the ceiling of the shower stall and there was no light fixture and because of the dark marble it made it impossible to see what you were doing. We opted to use the shower in the tub (which we were happy that this was an option). The shower in the tub had a rain showerhead. The toiletries included the brand, Etro. Bar soap, bath gel, shampoo and lotion were included. The bathroom also included a hair dryer, 2 robes, and 2 slippers. Amenities/Service We didn\u2019t use any of the hotel services. There is a spa service which we would have like to have tried. Everyone at the hotel was polite and courteous. The ground floor of the hotel is well decorated and there is plenty of sitting space.

I travel for business and pleasure. We take two vacations a year as a family. Those vacations are for a period of seven to 20 days each. My wife and I have used Tripadvisor for years. She has posted in the past but I have only used the site for my edification and am writing today for the first time. Our current travel experience has prompted me to write. I almost always look askance at postings of a terrible experience at a hotel that has a high Tripadvisor rating assuming it was an aberration. Alas, we are in the throws of such an experience at the Hotel 1898 in Barcelona, Spain. We love Barcelona. This is our second trip to the city. On our first trip, we had a wonderful experience. Great sites. Great people. I purchased one of my favorite pieces of original art from an artist in Barcelona which hangs in the entrance to our home. Our second trip to Barcelona has been a horror show. We came to the city for two days prior to a cruise. Our flight from Boston was delayed 10 hours but we slept on the flight to Paris before our connection to Barcelona. We looked forward to the Hotel 1898 as an oasis from the downside of travel. Alas, Hotel 1898 was anything but an oasis. My wife lost her passport. We assumed she lost it in the Barcelona airport but her recollection is that she had it in the hotel room. We take responsponsibility for not putting our cash and passports in the safe in our room. The passport is missing along with 300 Euros. It is a curious amount to be missing because it was three 100 euro bills that were taken from a larger sum of money and not all of the money was taken. We have taken the position that we lost the passport and have not complained to the hotel. We did ask them for their recommendation on what to do and they recommended we report the lost passport at the police station. They also told us the police would give us a report that would allow us to travel. I tipped the gentleman behind the desk 20 euro for his assistance. We did as advised and the police were very accommodating. We were told it will be up to the cruise line as to whether they let us board. We chalked the downside of our trip up to the adage: \"---- happens\" and were ready to put the incident behind us for the rest of the evening. Alas, that's when we ran into a Barcelona we had not seen before. In the lobby of the hotel is an oriental restaurant, La Xina. We looked forward to a relaxing dinner in the hotel. It was 10pm and we were told by the restaurant to return at 11pm for seating. Upon our return we were told a table was not ready and that we should go up to the bar and they would let us know when a table was ready. The bar consists of an oak runner around an open kitchen. Four bottles of Moet and some wine were stacked in a plastic crate filled with ice. There were no more than eight bottles of alcohol on the counter. It looked more like a bar you would see at a house party. I waited patiently while the young man made three frozen margaritas. Just before he was done another man that worked at the restaraunt came up from downstairs with five young women in tow. He stepped front of me and spoke to the bartender who nodded in return. Upon finishing the margaritas and passing them to a waiter the bartender looked past me to the young women to take their order. I politely said, \"Excuse me\". Without missing a beat, he told me he knew I was waiting but that he was told to wait on the women next. I asked the ma\u00eetre d if the restaurant was affiliated with the hotel or unaffiliated (I did not bother to complain). He told me it was unaffiliated. One can not give one's business to an establishment that could be so outwardly rude. Our family went for pizza down the street. When I travel I maintain low expectations and normally appreciate the courtesies extended to me and my family as guest saway from home.

Given the length of stay, we had initially thought of trying two different hotels (the other hotel we considered was the Meridien next door), but we are now glad that we stayed the entire period at H1898. We had a privilege room on the third floor overlooking the Ramblas. There were two windows, a large one opening out onto the Ramblas, and a smaller side window looking at the Meridien. The choice was made after we had inspected a superior room and a deluxe room (with a terrace) for comparison. The privilege room appealed because of its large size, high ceiling, separate sitting area with full length sofa, and above all else, its fantastic bathroom. The bath room was not only large and luxurious (in a classy green marble), but really clever in design, because it had twin vanities (facing each other) OUTSIDE of the main bath room, which housed a bath tub, WC, bidet and a generous glass enclosed shower stall with a rain shower. This room was definitely a five star rather than four, on account of this bath room and the size. The window facing the Ramblas brought life and light into the room, the sounds of pedestrians, street vendors, entertainers, and even clinking of cutlery in near by restaurants, wafted in along with the cool autumn air every evening. We felt pretty much part of the street scene even as we sat in the comfort of the sofa sipping sangria. Its location on the Ramblas is simply superb. Although there are a multitude of hotels all along the strip, this particular corner is literally a few steps from the Plaza Catalunya (transport hub for the airport bus, tourist bus, metro, tourist information), and also the location of Carrefour right next door means grocery shopping is a cinch. A daily trip there for fresh fruits and bottled water became a routine for us. Via the Ramblas, almost all the major sights are walking distance including the GOthic quarter, the Palau Musica, the Palau Guell, the Columbus monument, the Gaudi masterpierces of Casa Batllo and Casa Milla, and the main shopping street on Paseig de Gracia. The hotel is also a few steps from the La Boqueria Market, which means you can eat the freshest produce and sea food the city has to offer every day. The excellent Bar Boqueria in the market itself is great value for money. After we found it, we ate brunch and dinner there almost every day. Forget about the tourist trap restaurants touting tapas sets along the main street. Finally two features make H1898 truly magical, instead of merely excellent. The roof terrace with its really classy outdoor furniture, which offer a panoramic view in three directions (the fourth being blocked by the Meridien), best enjoyed in the early morning and late evening. Many other reviews have raved about the terrace so no further elaboration is needed. However, it is the indoor pool which captured my imagination and which I really want to draw attention to. It is in the basement, and while not big (about 9m x 4m), the cavernous design with serial roof arches and gothic stone claddings on the wall, together with special lighting effects, and haunting music make swimming here a surreal experience. On one end, there is a large back-lit black and white picture of padi fields carved into a cliff which makes one think of Bali. An early morning swim will definitely invigorate and give a great start to the day. The adjoining changing rooms come complete with towels and toiletries so you don't need to bring anything from your room. Strangely, it was always empty on each of the occasions I used it. Perhaps it should remain a well kept secret. Overall, despite going with already very high expectations from reading all the past reviews, the reality managed to surpass our imagination. The staff are helpful and responsive when approached, but are otherwise discreet rather than proactive, The only one gripe I have is the hotel could not provide an umbrella on a rainy day. Given the room rates, I think it is fair to expect this provision in every room since it is not a standard item in most travellers' luggage.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "surrey", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "mershall", "ReviewID": "UR22090112", "Content": "I took my wife to Hotel 1898 last weekend for a luxury break from the kids, and was not disappointed!

Barcelona was a fantastic city with so much to offer and we were in the heart of it all thanks to the location of Hotel 1898. Located on La Rambla, the main thoroughfare, we had everything in walking distance. La Boqueria (the largest market in Barcelona), Picasso Museum, Cathedral, Placa Real, Plaza Catayluna, Columbus Circle, A great Flamenco Theatre, great tapas bars and of course La Rambla itself and all of its street performers. Tip - If you are there for a few days, buy a bus tour ticket for two days and keep it on you, even though it's very touristy it gives you a great overview of the city and if you decide to walk around during the trip and find yourself a little far away, you'll always be near a stop instead of taking a cab back for another 10 euros. As far as the hotel itself - Extremely clean, modern, stylish, accommodating staff (all spoke english).

I loved this hotel -- from its facilities, the room, the service and the location. Location -- It's along Las Ramblas, so there is a lot of activity going on right when you step outside the hotel. It is a touristy area, so for some it may not be your cup of tea, but it is conveniently located beside MANY shops, cafes and most of all, the La Boqueria (a large public market quite famous in Barcelona. Make sure to go here if you're a foodie). You'll never get bored (shopping and lot of street performers) or hungry here. There's a McDonalds and KFC a few minutes walk away from the hotel, so if you're starting to miss the fast food, you can always go there. Room -- Immaculately clean. The design was very nice. My room was navy blue and white, very classy. Quite spacious for one person, really. They were quite generous with the amenities as well. There's a cool room feature that sort of sets the overall lighting of your room depending on your mood / activity -- for watching TV, for entertaining visitors, sleeping, etc. :) Staff / Service -- Professional and accommodating. Although I really didn't get to interact with them that much except for check in/out and when I asked for an electrical adaptor. But all in all, they were alright. Price -- Got this hotel because of an error made by the travel agent in my booking, so this was a pleasant mistake. But I would say it is still good value for the money. Facilities -- I haven't had the chance to use the facilities, but from what I have seen of the spa and the pool, I would like to go back and try them sometime. Food - Nothing remarkable. Don't expect an eye-popping spread, but it's alright. Overall - I love the hotel for the location, primarily.

Lovely Hotel Right in the centre of Las Ramblas. The moment of arriving our luggage was taken off us from outside the hotel and brought to reception for us by the porter. We checked in no problem. We booked a double room but had 2 single beds pushed together - Room 216. This was fine because I like my own space anyway. I have to be honest and say that the beds were very hard. They were Firm because I looked at the label on the matress. Not great if you are used to the Memory Foam type beds like we are. I found myself on the 2nd night with 6 pillows laid on top of the mattress with a blanket and sheet over the top, just to get some comfort. House Keeping will give you as many pillows, blankets etc as you want. This kind of ruined my stay in a way, because you pay for an expensive hotel and you don't expect to create your own bed. My partners brother and wife also stayed for 2 nights whilst we were there. Their room was 509 and the beds were softer than ours even though they were the same make. Maybe ours were newer than theirs. Not sure. The Room itself was lovely. I like a quiet and dark room anyway so it was great for us. We had a room in the inside of the hotel so we heard no noise from the main strip. This was great. The view from our room was not great, you could only see other peoples room windows, but enough light for us so that was fine. A view is not something that bothers me. The bathroom was lovely, great size with powerful taps etc and shower. Hair dryer, toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, bathrobes, soap, 2 pairs of slippers, bath foam, hand cream, the usual extras. No flannel. Excellent. Fresh towels and sheets every day ,which was great. House keeping were excellent. The spa and pool etc was lovely. It was never busy and we often had it to ourselves which was nice. Steam room and sauna, again great! They also have a gym but I did not use this. You are given a white towel robe in your room when you arrive for spa use so you won't need to bring one. Roof Terrace was great, such a nice relaxing place to sit. Pool looked nice too. Great service. You get a bowl of crisps with each drink order too. Reception bar was great, again a nice relaxing place and a lovely Italian Bar Man called Luca. He was very charming. Business Centre has 4 internet PC's. 2 of which didn't connect to internet. These 2 had the printers connected to them. If you want to print anything you will need to bring a memory stick with you and save onto it from the internet PC's that do connect and then insert into the other PC's (the one with printers connected) and print on them. We did this when checking in on line and printing our boarding passes off. We did not use the hotel for food so we can't comment on that, but i'm sure it was lovely.

Unhappily we accepted this fact and went up to our room (510) . When I opened the door my heart sank. A dark room with a tiny corner window. Worse still when I pulled back the curtain it faced out onto a small ventilation atrium. Even worse still there was a scaffold erected all the way up the air shaft. So, for any privacy the curtain would have to remain closed. The two beds were at opposite sides of the room, so it felt more like sleeping in a dormitory. We didn't have big plush beds. Instead you get small single beds that are on wheels. They were not comfortable at all. The so called turn down service is a total waste of time. All they do is pop a totally pointless piece of cloth (think teatowel) on the floor by your bed. They do not tidy your room at all at this point. When they did finally decide to tidy our room, the maid neglected to replace our bath towels. The breakfast is 21 euros! We didn't even bother to try it - far too expensive. When we went down to check out I had a few things I wanted to get off my chest, but as I should have expected the receptionist never actually bothered to ask if we had enjoyed our stay.

Flights were with flyglobespan and we booked our airport taxi's through the flyg. site too - all without any hitches. We didn't have any problems with noise as some reviewers have said (we slept well) but I think you have to accept if staying in a busy hotel in a busy street in a busy city - there will be noise! The bar service was friendly - drinks are a bit pricey, but again you are in the centre of the city. Breakfast selection was fine - but probably not enough if you like a big fry-up type of breakfast.

We couldn't have been happier with this hotel, and often had difficulty prying ourselves away from its confines to experience Barcelona. Some of the other reviews I read complained of poor service. We didn't experience anything like this. Everybody we met was extremely friendly and helpful. It wasn't like Four Seasons service where everybody is asking you every thirty seconds if you're okay, but if you express a need, it's seen to immediately. We booked a terrace room which will go down as one of my favorite hotel rooms of all time. We had an enormous private terrace, almost as large as the room, with beautiful plants, two spacious loungers, and a large table. We ate several meals out here and spent a lot of time relaxing. It faced a side street so noise from La Rambla was minimal. The room itself was decorated in black and white with rich wood floors. A/C was extremely powerful and worked brilliantly. TV was great with many more English channels than most European hotels. Enormous closet with plenty of storage space to unpack completely. Free Wi-Fi. The only complaint we had about the room is that our King bed was quite literally two LARGE single beds. Not bound together in the traditional manner, but actually on rollers and easily separated. This is fairly common in Europe and didn't really bother us. Bathroom was nicely appointed and spotlessly clean. Fresh robes and slippers every day. Nice toiletries and included shaving and dental kits automatically. Mini-bar was a bit sparse, but we stored things that we bought in the Starbucks downstairs in there and they didn't seem to mind. Location-wise, it can't be beat. It's right on Las Ramblas, and a two minute walk to the nearest Metro stop. Restaurants, shops, and conveniences abound. The shopping district is pretty much across the street. La Bocaqueria, the most amazing food market in Europe, is three minutes walk. For a quick fix, there is a Starbucks in the same building as the hotel. Food in the hotel was very good. Definitely above average. Room service was delivered within 20 minutes every time and always hot and delicious. We tried the buffet breakfast and were very pleased with it. Lots of little luxuries like champagne were made available. We ate in the main restaurant one night and LOVED our food. Service was also good, and they let us take our time. We ate on the rooftop restaurant another night and besides the shockingly high price of drinks we had an immensely beautiful dinner. How can you beat the view from the rooftop cafe as the sun sets over all of Barcelona? It was a memorable experience. Pools were fantastic. The rooftop pool was small, but refreshing, and the lounge areas on the rooftop are just too much fun to relax on. We went for a rooftop swim as the sun was going down our last evening in Barcelona, and it was simultaneously fun and romantic. The pool down by the Spa is really fun-looking. The gym was small, but we weren't there to work-out. We didn't try any of the spa services, unfortunately. Overall, we found this hotel to be a really good fit for us. We are relaxed people who don't like to make a fuss, but we also like our luxuries when we're on vacation. This hotel epitomized that relaxed luxury, and combined it with jaw-dropping views and location.

Amazing in a hotel of this class and price range. So being typically english we did it ourselves but not a good opening impression. By the way this was repeated on checkout. No help whatsoever and 4 members of the lobby team watched us struggle past to the taxi. The rooms are good. Well furnished with a super cool lighting system and very nice bathroom.

This is a party city and we were constantly woken throughout the entire night by drunken guests returning to their rooms. Not good enough for a Hotel charging these prices. You expect to sleep surely ? The rooftop terrace is fantastic ! Very trendy, cool and amazing views. The pool is very small though, but loads of places to sit / lie and catch the sun.

If you are a single person on a business trip in Barcelona, be careful of the pick pockets at night on the very busy Ramblas. There are many groups of African women who are very aggressive in their attempts to pick your pockets.

Upon reading the reviews and seeing the location of Arts, I cancelled this booking to stay at 1898. What a mistake. The cost was about the same, (370 Euros a night for a bedroom with terrace at 1898). Paying this sort of money, I expected, rightly or wrongly so, to have some sort of standard of service. How wrong we were. We arrived to be told that there were no irons and ironing boards allowed in the rooms, that they were a 'risk', so if you wanted anything to be ironed, you had to pay for laundry (I am surprised no one else noted this?). The luggage we brought along would have cost well over 100 Euros to be ironed. How ridiculous. So we nipped to Carrefour next door and got a travel iron!!!! Not exactly what I had in mind for our special break!!!!! The room (532 I think it was) was smaller than I imagined it would be, spotlessly clean I hasten to add, with a nice private terrace to lounge around in, which I appreciated. It was nicely decorated, but not at all spacious in size for the price we paid. The service is what lets this hotel down. We had problems getting a taxi one night and there were 4 people behind the reception desk doing nothing, whilst the concierge over the road at the Meridien, were hailing every available taxi for their clients. Very irritating. Also, the service on the roof top terrace was spectacularly awful. I shouldnt have to send my husband to find a waiter to get us drinks, or have to look at remanants of breakfast left by other guests for half an hour. The location, la rambla, is awful. Coming from Amsterdam, this was the worst place for us to be situated. What a nasty, smelly, crowded tourist hellhole. We went to Hotel Arts for a drink one lunchtime and I severely regret cancelling that booking. There were staff everywhere. Service was efficient and polite and professional. This was truly a 5 star experience. I shall be booking there on our next trip for sure. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone, because I felt it was majorly overpriced for what you get.

Overall not disappointed,but there are few minor issues that mark the hotel down a little. First the positives: Great position, really easy to get to from the airport - the bus stops around 500 metres away - and central for everything, right next to La Rambla. The roof pool (for dipping) and the bar are really great; they made a great Negroni - very strong. The drinks are expensive but you are paying for the fact you are on a roof with really comfortable seats and a good view. Food is also pricey and not hugely original. One evening we ordered a selection of meats for \u20ac23 and received a plate of one type of ham! Staff on the roof are very willing but service is a bit slow if there are a lot of people. Bedroom was large (Privilege Room) with a fantastically comfortable bed; room was well sound proofed with efficient A/C. Huge choice of pillows if important to you. Free newspaper (laser printed) every day. We didn't use the spa in the basement but it looked good if a little small. Now the minor niggles, which did not detract from our stay but should be ironed out based on the prices they charge: Free tea is offered every day in the lobby between 5 and 7 pm. The lobby and bar lack atmosphere (everyone is on the roof!). There was no one around to serve the tea and when the barman eventually was found we were not offered a choice of tea (there were 2 types) but the tea was poured and it was pretty awful! One of the bathroom taps kept falling off and we were only supplied 1 small piece of soap (both these issues were rectified the day the hotel was notified) The A/C control is inside the main cupboard: It's very hard to read the control and if any staff member needs to get at it they have to go into your cupboard where all your stuff is stored - not a great piece of planning. No biscuits in the room with the coffee - a bit penny pinching. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel (v. pricey) but there are loads of places outside - even a Starbucks in the hotel building if you like their coffee! The staff at the main desk are polite and efficient but as has been mentioned by other reviewers they do what is necessary and no more. That little extra touch is missing Overall we would stay again in one of their standard rooms and spend all moments at the hotel on the roof, which is the highlight.

Travelling to the airport can be done very easily via the airport bus (costs ca. 4 EUR pp) which goes to Plaza Catalunya - then ca. 5 min. walk to the hotel. The hotel itself is fantastic. Great service, extremely clean (it seems they are cleening all day long) and it offers a fantastic roof terrace with pool and bar. The terrace is the perfect place to escape a bit from the vibrating city life - you can just relax at the pool or lay in one of the roof terrace couches and enjoy some drinks or food. The pool bar is open late night and they also offer breakfast up there but one has to pre-order that the day before. - That seemed a bit odd and they were not flexible if you just wanted to take the breakfast there in the morning without preordering. Another advice: as you stay so central there is always cabs going along outside the hotel you don't need to order that via the hotel - some cab drivers charge up to 6.20 EUR for coming to the hotel after being called - even though they just drive around the corner ...

All a bit small for the $$$ however- comparing it to the room we had in a Paris hotel afterwards. We were on the 5th floor, out the back, overlooking a plaza that got a bit noisy later in the days. Faciities are very good, the gym/ pool complex in the basement was very groovy, as was the bar/ pool area on the roof- warning- don't try and dive in the pool, it is tiny and only knee deep, really there for true dipping as opposed to anything else. Yes, drinks are expensive, but the 360 degree view is superb. The service levels stayed the same over the 3 nights we were there- cool, standoffish- they don't help people in off the street with their luggage for example- they stand back and wait for you to come to them! Didn't eat there, too many choices outside. All in all, as I've said above. I think it was expensive for what we got, I think you may as well just get an \"ordinary\" room, a fair bit cheaper.

This makes for a truly nice and genuine old building, where the insides have been ripped out and redone completely. Absolutely everything inside is new, including the newly carved out parking garage. We arrived to check in without any problems, after first having some quarrel with the GPS. The street La Rambla is not a valid GPS destination for this hotel, after calling the hotel we were told the street address is Pintor Fortyun 1, and the GPS guided us to the front door. The location is on the main tourist street in BCN, apart from the scores of cheap-flight tourists hanging around the location can't be more perfect in BCN. After check in we ordered parking for the car a bit pricey at 23 \u20ac per night. But the garage is right under the hotel, amazing for such an old building and I was guided in by the bellhop. The room is probably too small for its price category, but very tall and nicely done. Very clean, and always magically cleaned when we were out. The A/C was found inside the closet not difficult to find but a bit difficult to read the screen. After shivering through the night with an overzealous A/C I decided to read the manual and discovered how to run it proper. Room was quiet, apart from some low hallway noise. Not a nuisance. There's plenty of channels on the TV, but not all of them were as according to the manual. Nice to have Fox Series to watch in the evening after the spa. We did not feel the 20 \u20ac breakfast was a good enough value to eat in the hotel. On the roof is one of the major assets of this hotel, a smallish pool and a very nice bar. The pool is good for a dip in the heat and there is several beds along the rooftop. Ample amounts of towels and a complimentary bathrobe makes the lack of changing area near the pool a non-issue. In the bar, there's no a lot of perfection, in spit of the staff effort. They are courteous and friendly, but not very professional. Also, the drinks are very off on the recipe, like the strawberry daiquiri. Nice selection of cheeses on a plate along with a bottle of good red wine is a much better bet in the not very comfortable large divans. The spa in floor -1 is nice, with a warm and comfortable spa pool. Steam sauna is still out of order, and the Finnish sauna was not hot enough at 70 degrees Celsius and low humidity. At the business centre, there's the usual Americans hogging the computers chatting along with home base in Kentucky or where ever but fortunately there is enough of them to go around. I had to print, sign and fax a contract in the evening and none of these actions were an issue. WiFi in the room was very slow and needed a login and password from the desk to function.

We stayed at Hotel 1898 in June 2008 for 2 nights. We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel but the rooms are a little small, especially at \u00a3350 a night. We had a terrace so that helped, otherwise we would have felt too squashed in. We stayed in room 526, which was on the 5th floor, facing the back of the building. The rooms were extremely clean and always had fresh towels and bed linen. The bathroom was lovely and with me being 6'2 the bath was ample. As for the rest of the hotel, the spa in the basement was nice, but the water in the pool was extremely cold. Almost to the point of shivering, the steam room was not working either! We found that it would have been nicer if someone from the hotel had shown us around first as it was a little off putting just walking round free roam. The roof top bar/pool was ok. The bar is extremely expensive, \u00a315.00 for a gin and tonic. The pool on the roof is very small, the photos on the hotel website make the pool out to be bigger than it actually is, also there is no where to change on the roof so if you are wanting a quick dip in the pool, forget about it. You would have to walk back through the hotel dripping wet. Also we couldn't find any dry towels on the roof on 2 occasions. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as for \u20ac20 it seemed expensive. Plus the hotel has a door into the Starbucks next door so we just went there {be warned though that in Barcelona none of the Starbucks Menus had a translation so unless you are fluent in spanish/catalan you might just have to guess}. We had drinks in the reception area of the hotel, but again very expensive and the quality was nothing special. They had very little choice if you didn't drink alcohol, which is the norm in Barcelona from what we found. We found that the hotel staff didn't really speak to us much, even though they had door staff and reception staff. This was a little off putting. We were able to check in at 12 o'clock which was nice. The music system in the room didn't work at all and the TV was almost unwatchable, very fuzzy! for \u00a3350 a night you would expect these things to work. The pillows and bed were lovely though.

The business center was outstanding with 4 computers with free internet access, leather furniture, and a conference table. Again, very classy. The rooftop bar and pool area was great. The spa and pool area in the basement was top notch. I had the silk feet massage and it was wonderful, but too short. The breakfast buffet was pretty good.

Although not huge, the bathroom was above average compared to other 4 and 5 stars we have stayed at. There were several complaints on tripadvisor about room noise, but our room faced the side street and was very quiet.

I was worried about the noise from La Rambla, so asked for quiet room at the back when booking and our room (No 404) fitted the bill perfectly.

We skipped the breakfast, at 20 euros, it's expensive and you can eat like a king at plenty of cafes in the neighbourhood or at the Bouqeria market. The rooftop pool and terrace are just fantastic, great to unwind in late afternoon to catch the last of sunshine before going out in the evening. The same goes for the grotto pool, sauna and the gym in the cellar. The reception staff was very helpful, they secured us a last minute reservation at Hisop on Saturday night.

Where do I begin? If you are looking for a place with style, elegance and amazing hospitality H1898 is the place to visit. An expensive hotel but worth every penny. I treated my other half to an all expenses paid weekend in Barcelona for his birthday. I rented a convertible and we drove up from the south of Spain. Upon arrival at the hotel the doorman and my other half parked the car in the underground car park (payable daily) whilst I checked in. I had contacted the hotel in advance to organise some special extras such as rose petals on the bed and a massage each. They had also booked us a table with amazing views at Torre de Altamar http://www.torredealtamar.com/ - dont even think about eating anywhere else, even if it is \u00a3100 per head. This is the BEST restaurant in Barcelona! Just be aware you need to go in a glass elevator to reach it. Not the best thing when you are scared of heights as I am. I didnt even need to remind the guy in Reception of the extras I had arranged, he whispered that all was in hand. When we arrived in the room, there waiting for us was a complimentary bottle of Champagne, complimented by the rose petals and the mood lighting... the impact couldn't have been better. I had booked an executive room which was perfect, we had lovely views of las ramblas from the 4th floor and standing out on the balcony in the H1898 dressing gowns and slippers and sipping champagne in the sunshine watching the hussle and bussle in the street below was a moment in itself. The street performers who did notice us up there, gazing down, must have thought we were royalty, and we certainly felt like it. Then we come to the bed.... OH MY GOD. It was so big we could both sleep like star fish and not touch, and wow I cant tell you how comfortable it was. I had the best nights sleep of my life. The hotel is classic, sophisticated yet modern. Lovely leather sofas fill the lobbey yet the walls are covered by ceiling to floor black and white photographs of modern subjects such as a very tangled power line. Very small, menial faults I would probably point out if I had to tell you something bad may be that a couples massage wasn't possible because they only had one member of staff working in the spa at a time, a hot english breakfast would have been nice although the spread was out of this world, the serenity of the swimming pool in the basement was ruined by two unsupervised teenagers but then we only used it when waiting for the massages. But dont let any of these points influence you because they are nothing compared to the positives about this amazing hotel. The hotel was so amazing we actually only made it to Barcelona Zoo & the aqarium but then art or spanish history wasn't appealing to myself or my spanish boyfriend so it didnt matter.

I chose the hotel 1898 mainly based upon tripadvisor reviews and we thought the hotel was absolutely fabulous. The location is as near perfect as you could find being on La Rambla. It is convenient to the Plaza de Catalunya which has the departure point for the two tourist bus companies as well as shops and restaurants. La Rambla is always extremely busy but the hotel althought located on this street is like an oasis from the bussle of the throngs of people. Indeed when relaxing in the lobby of the hotel it is hard to imagine that outside it is so busy. There were two things we particularily enjoyed at the hotel. The first was the rooftop terrace. People in their reviews constantly refer to this terrace but it really is that good. The views were outstanding and it is so relaxing. The second thing we enjoyed was the spa in the basement: what a lovely way to enjoy an hour or indeed two. The spa was very clean and tidy and in the pool area the jacuzzi beds and water jets were so much fun. We booked a superior room and my first impression was that it was a little bit smaller than I had imagined. However the quality of the room was evident to see in both the fittings and style of the room. The bed was very wide and there was a choice of four types of pillow. The room had a sound system that gave a choice of continuous music to whatever type you found relaxing as well as a lighting system that allowed to select for different moods/requirements which I found quite good. The reception staff were helpful in chosing restaurants and had books showing the decor and menus of several. We chose one called Barkeno and if you like fish I can highly recommend it . It is also within walking distance of the hotel. The hotel is not inexpensive but if you are looking for a good 4 star hotel then in this location it is well worth the expense.

The hotel is clean and well appointed and rooms are (for city centre) well sized with air conditioning in room, free internet, and good bathroom. The staff I met did slightly let down the hotel. I realise they are full all year, deal with tourists and transient business travellers every minute of every day, but regardless, they are in the service business and the couldn't care less disinterested attitude to any question (neither complaints or compliments) in both English or Spanish, was the only thing that let this otherwise excellent hotel down.

We booked the hotel for three nights starting Monday April 28th. We didn\u2019t arrive until 4:15 PM and so the 3 pm check-in time was a non-issue. We had reserved a superior room and we were given Room 445, facing Las Ramblas. - Ok, so for those that have commented on the noise factor in past posts and for those who may be concerned about this \u2013 it is a real issue if you have a room facing Las Ramblas. When we checked in, I specifically asked if the room faced Las Ramblas and was told yes, to be fair. I asked for a different room facing another street but was told there were none available. The noise was not a factor on Monday evening or Tuesday evening \u2013 keep in mind we were out until 2 AM or so ourselves and once we hit the pillow we immediately passed out! So, no worries there. On our last evening, we were in bed quite early by Barcelona standards \u2013 11 PM \u2013and by now it was Wed of course. There was constant noise all night long and admittedly it was pretty loud at times \u2013 seemed like there was an actual rave happening down on the street below! My fianc\u00e9 and I laughed it off in the morning \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t keep us from staying there again \u2013 for reference we are thirty-somethings who aren\u2019t terribly conservative but don\u2019t party until dawn anymore either. Another point on the noise \u2013 the Metro runs underneath the hotel (at least it feels like it must) \u2013 every 15 to 30 minutes you can feel the train passing by\u2026feels like a 1 or 2 on the Richter scale actually. Did we sleep through that every night? Absolutely. Did you wonder what the hell it was the first or second time it happened? You bet. On to the wonderful traits of Hotel 1898\u2026the lobby and rooms are of spectacular design and feel. The designer did a great job of combining modern amenities with an Asian twist (building housed the old Filipino tobacco company in case you didn\u2019t know). The lobby is amazing, complete with a sitting area and bar. The dark hardwood floors and green/black color scheme is really cool. Room 445 is a Superior Room and provided considerable more space than a standard room (we peaked into a standard room being cleaned as we walked by). There were two twin beds pushed together to form a double which was a little annoying. Another negative was no iron in the room. As an American I think we just needed to get used to this concept, that's all. However like Casa Fuster we checked through Travelocity and assumed there were irons in the room - not the case. Anyway, I digress. I know a couple of other reviews talked about things being stolen from the room - a non-issue with us although we used the in-room safe religiously. The bathroom was very nice with rainfall showerhead, bidet and toiletries. My fiance liked the full length mirror against the bathroom door as well as mirrors above the bathroom sink and behind you on the back wall. Altogether we were very pleased with the room. It had a nice layout and was very clean and stylish. The rooftop terrace is awesome \u2013 a pool slightly larger than that of Casa Fuster\u2019s (where we stayed prior to the Hotel 1898) and a bar on the rooftop with posh, comfortable seating all around. Definitely a huge plus. The basement spa and exercise facility are also quite nice. Compared to Casa Fuster this was far superior. The exercise room had 2 treadmills, 2 bikes, a stairmaster and a weight bench with some dumbbells. The basement pool was more of a spa pool with a couple of jaccuzzi-type massage chairs and a few shower-type waterfalls. There is a sauna and a steam room as well as two showers. One can also book massage although we opted not to do so. We certainly enjoyed the basement pool on two different occasions in the afternoon after a long day of walking. The service of the staff was definitely above average. However, keep in mind we had just come from the Casa Fuster where service was far superior. Hotel 1898 staff just weren't quite as overly accomodating is all, although we didn't find fault with anyone at all. As I posted in my Casa Fuster review, it was more of a 'we provide the info, you do the work\" type of scenario. The staff did book a taxi for a 6:30 AM departure upon checkout without issue. Location, location, location. Noise comments aside, one cannot beat the location of Hotel 1898 if being in the thick of the action is your thing. The hotel is right across the street from Le Meridien and, although we didn't go inside and although Le Meridien has recently been renovated, Hotel 1898 certainly appears to have trumped the Le Meridien. More importantly, the hotel is 5 minutes or less from La Boqueria, 5 mins from the Barri Gottic (if that), and perhaps 10-15 minutes to Born. We loved this about the hotel. By the way, we never felt the least bit unsafe leaving/returning to the hotel. It was a sanctuary from all the action going on just outside the front and side doors. We would definitely stay at the Hotel 1898 again.

Never got round to reviewing it, partly because it was just as good as everyone said and there was nothing to add. But now I see it has slipped to No3 - probably because other people who loved it thought the same! So I have to set the records straight and say just how fab it is!!! Stayed here for two nights at the beginning of a cruise starting from Barcelona, and for one night at the end. The rooms were great and exceptionally well equipped. Luxury bathrobe, cute 1898 monogrammed slippers, and lovely toiletries come as standard. Also welcome was a kettle and tea making facilities (so rare in Europe), as well as very useful fridge, safe etc. Beds were huge and very comfy, and the bathroom with state of the art shower was also fab. The lobby with its huge seating area and ground floor bar are a great place to relax, and lovely and cool in contrast to the heat of Las Ramblas outside. But the highlight has to be the open air roof terrace with fantastic views of Barcelona, rooftop pool (small but great for cooling off), roof top bar and a huge range of sunbeds, al fresco four poster 'beds' (yes really!), sofas etc. A stunning place to relax with a drink, or a book, or even take a snooze - day, evening or night. There is also a basement indoor spa which we only looked at briefly, but would be a great place to relax during a winter stay. The dining room also looked inviting although we didn't sample its fare, and breakfast looked great but wasn't cheap (so if you are a breakfast fan look for a breakfast inclusive package). We also loved Las Ramblas - don't expect the chic of Paris or you will be disappointed. But for buzz and atmosphere its hard to beat - a huge range of bars and resturants, street entertainers and market stalls leading down to the port. Nearby squares are inviting, with yet more resturants and some great shops and tapas bars - the Calamari seemed to be consistently fantastic wherever we tried it. And the huge glasses of Sangria have to be seen to be believed!! On the waterfront (just at the bottom of Las Ramblas, turn left when you reach the water and walk for about ten minutes) there are some fabulous seafood resturants, and a great bar situated on a boat which is a stunning place for an early evening drink. From here its only fifteen minutes walk or so to the beach; the close proximity of beach and city is one of many things that make Barcelona so unique. Here there are another huge range of resturants to choose from - our favourite undoubtedly the Carpe Diem Lounge Bar - yet more al fresco 'beds' where you can sit and lounge with your drink and even eat dinner - totally surreal!! And from here its only another ten minutes or so walk to the Olympic Marina with a huge range of resturants and nightclubs - and a taxi rank to get back to the hotel if your feet aren't up for the walk home! Other things we loved included Gaudi Park - amazing architecture and fabulous views over the city. A bit of a walk from the nearest underground stop but well worth it. We also loved the sensational Fountain of Montjuic that does a fabulous 'Sound and Light' show around 9pm every Thursday to Sunday evening in Summer (Fri and Sat in Winter) - nearest Metro stop Placa Espanya. And finally no visit to Barcelona would be compete without visiting the Sagardia Familia and taking the lift to the top. This unfinished cathederal is simply unique - a truly amazing place. Its difficult to describe just why its so good; you just have to go there and see!!! Queues for the lift were long when we were there, but worth every minute of the wait. Overall I can only highly recommend both Barcelona and Hotel 1898. Only one disadvantage. When you say to a taxi driver at the Airport or wherever you would like to go to 'Hotel Eighteen Ninety Eight' they look at you completely blankly - since of course it woud be said completely differently in Spanish!!

We wanted a top-end establishment in the heart of the touristy part of the city, and we picked the 1898, well, to be honest, because of the tripadvisor reviews - I think it was no. 1 in popularity at the time of booking! The reception was slightly disappointing - in spite of my having given my credit card details when booking, the clerk insisted on taking a photocopy of the card, something I have never encountered before. The room (we took a 'superior' room) was superbly furnished (it must have cost a bomb to kit out!), with mahogany furniture, exotic parquet flooring and a gorgeous all-marble bathroom. Everything was spanking new, and not a sign of shabbiness anywhere. I particularly liked the lighting 'modules', whereby you can choose a programme such as 'Welcome', 'Ambience', Read', or 'Night'; I wish I had installed such modules when recently building our house, but had never heard of them or imagined them before. At night the room was quite noisy. This didn't bother us as we wanted a room right on La Rambla, and sleep well through noise; but the window was ill-fitting, and it sounded as though it was open all the time. The hotel could well do a bit of work on soundproofing, which could be far more effective. The bed was very comfortable, but I could have done with sheets and blankets rather than duvets, which are far too hot (I often end up taking the duvet out and sleeping under its cover only). The bathroom was luxurious as I have said, but why only one tiny cake of soap? It looks mean amidst all the luxury. The bath taps were complicated to work out: there were three of them, all with different functions, and the porter could have given an explanation when he brought the bags up. The service at reception was excellent (although we only asked for restaurant bookings in town a couple of times). Otherwise the reception staff were perfectly helpful and friendly. The spa was delightful (although I was hoping for a jacuzzi temperature!). We didn't check the roof terrace and pool as it was far too cold. Breakfast was fine, but perhaps a trifle dear. We had the small breakfast: coffee, tea or chocolate with ready-made salami sandwiches, or croissants and pastries, for \u20ac9. The large breakfast (strangely called 'continental' - which for me is a limited meal) looked excellent, but very expensive (\u20ac20 I think) and we didn't want to fill ourselves up before lunch. I was disappointed by the fact that there was nowhere (apart from outside on the roof) that I could smoke. Most hotels have a smoking room or you can smoke in the bar, but I was banished to a sleazy bar in the Pla\u00e7a Reial to indulge my naughty habit (I can hear righteous non-smokers cheering). But there seems to be no reason why the beautiful and unused marble hall giving on to the side-entrance (La Rambla entrance) should not be set aside for smokers. The situation is perfect for the tourist, being smack in La Rambla, and almost everything you want is within not unreasonable walking distance (Park Gu\u00ebll apart). The price is perfectly normal and reasonable for what the hotel is - no arguments there. All in all a good experience, and tripadvisor's reviewers were absolutely right. We would certainly stay here again.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cGive us a break\u201d", "Author": "CorkCharles", "ReviewID": "UR15032660", "Content": "Charlie Hill, Cork Ireland.

Its a great location and a walk up the pedestrian path through the centre of the road gives an interesting sample of local life with the bird markets, and a large food market a short distance from the hotel. Las Ramblas is a great place to enjoy a drink in the evening. Hotel 1898 is an outstandingly beautiful hotel. The interior design is beyond reproach. When I viewed the photos of the grotto style inside pool I thought that it could not live up to my expectations. But it was gorgeous and the roof top pool area with bed style seats was equally difficult to drag myself away from. I sampled some of the starter style nibbles at the rooftop bar/cafe, although they were pricey they were delicious. I regret that I did not try the restaurant in the hotel but will do so on my next visit. I would probably opt for a breakfast included deal next time as there is nowhere good nearby for the hearty breakfast I was looking for. I didn't find the cafes etc on Las Ramblas to be very good.

Two of those were spent at the Hotel 1898 and I have to say that I would have spent my entire stay but they did not have availability for all four nights \u2013 unless of course you count the Colonial Suite for 1500 Euro a night, which is \u2013 regretfully \u2013 outside my budget for Barcelona. I also spent two nights at the Casa Fuster which was also very nice, but much more expensive than the 1898. In the end, although I liked the Casa Fuster better than the 1898, I really cannot fault the later for very much. Although the hotel truly falls short of a 5-star property, it is probably the best value in Barcelona \u2013 euro for euro \u2013 hands down. I had a Superior room which was large, comfortable, and contained a number of great amenities. I also really enjoyed the \u201cmaritime\u201d themed decore that was echoed throughout the hotel. Instead of cheesy hotel art there where nautical charts, maps, and old photographs a There was a fairly large marble bathroom with a full bathtub. It\u2019s definitely not the most luxurious bathroom I have seen, but it did the job and was certainly spacious enough for one person. Although there were two sinks, you really had to squeeze to accommodate the second person. Most noteworthy was the \u201cautomated\u201d lighting system. I have seen this many times before, at other hotels but I was really impressed with it at the 1898. One button turns all the lights on, one turns them all off, one keeps the bathroom lights on and a small \u201cnightlight\u201d and there are modes for TV watching, reading, and more. Other hotels attempt to do this but I always find myself manually turning on various lamps, unplugging others, and generally cannot seem to make use of the automated lighting features. I also got to make use of the indoor pool which I absolutely loved. I never made it to the gym section \u2013 which was small but stocked with a few treadmills, elliptical machines, bikes and light free-wieghts. While I was swimming I noticed a number of people using the equipment \u2013 so people do actually get good use out of the gym. This whole section looked like it had just completed renovation and looked brand new, swimming in the indoor pool as the temperature outside dropped a few degrees every day was a dream. I did not make it to the rooftop pool but it looks fantastic from the other trip advisor pictures. There is a bar up there in the summertime, but it was closed at the end of November when I was staying there. The breakfast was also standard 4-star fare. I did notice a number of exotic fruits like dragon fruit and passion fruit which I wasn\u2019t expecting to find but for 19 Euro a person I can\u2019t say it was any better or worse than your standard over-priced hotel continental breakfast. I wouldn\u2019t pay for the breakfast again. One evening after I was tired from a full day of sight seeing and wanting to rest before heading out for drinks, I decided to eat dinner in the main restaurant of the hotel rather than head out. I walked in at 8:45 and there was not a single person there. Just 2 or 3 bored waiters. Needless to say, I walked right out and went to the restaurant next door to the hotel \u2013 I think it was called \u201c111.\u201d I wish I would have avoided the hotel\u2019s restaurant b/c seeing it empty like that left me with a disappointed feeling about the hotel in general. Although the 1898 offers so much for the money, I don\u2019t believe it really could be a truly deluxe 5-star property. Although everything was very nice, it was obvious where a few liberties had been taking in order to save money and be able to offer the value. The furnishings had this low-cost feel to them, almost like what IKEA would offer if they went the maritime traditional look. Sure, it looks great in a catalog and on a website, and at the end of the day it gets the job done, but there are certainly better options (for more money, of course). My biggest complaint however were the towels in the bathroom. Although there were many of them and the bath towels were extremely large, they felt like towels you are given at the local gym when working out. Either they had been washed way too much or I have been spending too much time at the Four Seasons and have gotten used to soft towels. I don\u2019t know. How hard could it be to provide soft towels? And speaking of the Four Seasons, I thought the mattress could have been a bit softer, but I find that firmer (and slimmer) mattresses are the norm in Europe and so this was not unexpected. I should say that the choice of pillows was a very nice touch thought I did not have an opportunity to take advantage of it. Although I have gone on and nit-picked a little above and I have decided not to give the 1898 5-out-of-5, I want everyone to know that the above negatives are totally minor. I would stay at the 1898 again a thousand times! It is the perfect choice for a hotel on the Ramblas. It is so close to Placa Catalunya and a perfect starting point from which to enjoy the city. There is even a Starbuck\u2019s attached to the lobby for all those who are homesick but want to avoid McDonalds et al. \u2013 but watch out: At a worse than $1.50/Euro exchange rate on the street, those white chocolate mochas will cost you dearly \u2013 as will everything else. The old adage \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d is certainly true, if you want a truly deluxe experience, 225 Euro per night for a superior room will simply not get you there. Instead you get an experience that approximates the 5-star deluxe hotel which for most \u2013 and at those fantastic prices, is more than enough.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cThe Best of Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "erikalicious", "ReviewID": "UR11285955", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel 1898 and absolutely loved it!

The \"superior\" room was certainly large enough for two. There was plenty of storage, robes, slippers, large tub, excellent climate control. Even the \"balcony\", just enough to stand on, but provided a bird's eye view of the goings on in Las Ramblas. Quiet too, except I was able to hear (feel) the sound of the subway. Never did it keep me awake - perhaps a higher floor (we were on the 3rd) would help. Never used the restaurant - so many bakeries and cervesarias nearby, and the Boqueria Market. Don't buy the mango juice from the stalls in front. They charge 2 euros - the ones farther back to the side only charge 1 euro. Staff was professional, and provided everything we asked for - which was plenty! Excellent restaurant advice. Two of note: Neyras on Via Laietana 41 - easy to find - both tapas and regular menu. We ordered off the regular and were impressed. Also, El Pintor (Sant Honorat 7) in Barri Gotic off Placa Jaume. So incredibly good we went back for a second dinner before we left. Have the hotel make reservations for you! Try the salted cod with honey, pine nuts & raisins. Try the profiteroles. Seriously. Also, we found success by never taking the Turistic Bus. The bus/subway is so cheap, easy and clean. Why go all over the place when you can only really see 2 or 3 sights a day? Why wait on that horrible line? Take the 24 bus from Placa Catalunya to Park Guell. Take the subway to Sagrada Famiglia and then walk the \"Ruta de Modernisme\" following the signs in the sidewalk along the Diagonal. Take the green line Subway to the funicular up to Montjuic and see Joan Miro and the National Museum of Catalan Art. Walk through the Barri Gotic and make sure to see the Roman ruins in the basement of the Museum of le Ciutat of Barcelona. ARTICKET: if you like art, history & architecture, buy it. For 20 euros, you get entrance to 7 museums (Picasso, Joan Miro, La Pedrera, etc. - it pays for itself after three) Buy it at the tourist info center below Placa Catalunya.

I am a frequent business traveler both within the US and internationally and have experience with many hotels (Four Seasons, Starwood, Ritz Carlton, etc...). Hotel 1898 is part of a chain of upscale boutique hotels in Spain. The pluses are that the hotel is in nice condition with clean rooms and good looking common spaces (including 2 pools). Our experience was ruined, however, by the incredibly unhelpful staff at Hotel 1898 who seemed to go out of their way to be outright rude to us - for instance, my wife called to ask if the conceirge could make a dinner reservation for us. Four hours later, we had heard nothing so she called again. The concierge responded by snapping that they were very busy and would call when they got around to it - by the time they did, the restaurant was fully booked. Another major problem was that the Hotel was simply mismanaged - although the check-in time was 3pm, the hotel refused to check us in at that time saying that the rooms were not clean. We were not able to check in until over two hours later and the hotel offered us no recompense for this significant inconvenience aside from one drink at the bar.

We had read several reviews of this hotel; most were positive, some were not. We would absolutely recommend this beautiful hotel for adults travelling without children. The hotel's central location on the La Rambla was perfect, and after a busy and crowded day signhtseeing, the hotel's quiet and sophisticated interior was like a calming oasis for us. Although we did not eat in the hotel, we made use of the luxurious roof deck, with its pool and deep upholstered chaises (in some cases, as large as full sized beds) to read and relax. The sunsets were glorious from the roof and the roof bar served fabulous cocktails. Yes, the drinks were pricey, but certainly in line with a hotel of this quality. Our room faced a side street off La Rambla, which was great since there was a three-day festival going on during our stay, resulting in huge crowds and lots of activity. Although our room was a bit small, it had a high ceiling and luxurious appointments. We were especially impressed with the lighting and dimming control system and how well buffered we were from the noise outside. Our stay cost us $2,200.00 USD for four nights and five days in a Superior room. We had read previous reviews which were critical of the hotel's staff. We found the staff to be curteous, friendly and very helpful. Since we were arriving in Barcelona early in the morning, the hotel made arrangements to have our room ready for us earlier then the normal check-in time, secured our luggage and made a safe available for our use. With reference to the safety within and without the hotel, the staff stressed using the room safe for our valuables and being \"aware\" of the people around us in the streets while touring the city. We never had any problems or felt unsafe in Barcelona. Our favorite place to eat a light and scrumpous breakfast was Escriba, only as few blocks from the hotel. Be realistic about prices since the US Dollar is weak compared to the Euro. Expect to pay around $30.00 USD for two mini quiches, coffee, bottles of water and one (fantastic) chocolate croissant. You should make dinner reservations for popular restaurants or expect to wait until 10:00 p.m. or later to have dinner. We would suggest purchasing the one or two day tourist bus pass which provides an excellent overview of the city. You can get off and back on the bus as often as you like during a twelve hour period, allowing you to visit sites of interest for as long as you wish.

Did take a superior room. Some comments are shown below. 1) The taxi was 21 Euros from the airport. The fare was 28 Euro from the hotel to the airport--traffic was heavy in the morning. Did tip. If you request a taxi at the front desk and they call for one, the flag drops when the taxi driver receives the call. We did this once and when the taxi arrived at the hotel, the fare was already 4.5 Euros. 2) The front desk was very nice and helpful. Most spoke English. We are in our middle 60's and my wife has difficulty walking because of back surgeries. We asked to see a few rooms to see which bathroom would work out the best. They showed us 3 rooms. We picked room 344--overlooked the La Rambla. Windows cut out most of the street noise. 3) Room was very clean. Two twin mattresses were placed together. In the tub/shower, the top knob determined if the water came out of the spigot or the 8\" shower head. The lower knob determined the water temperature. The bathroom had a hair dryer and a towel warmer rack. The room was equipped with a light dimming system--very unique. 4) The Hotel has 4 free computers for your use on the first floor. 5) We did not try the breakfast. We did not think it was worth 19 Euros(26US$)/person. The room was supplied with complimentary instant coffee, teas, and a water heater. There is a Starbucks next door and a grocery store on La Rambla 1 block toward Plaza Catalunya. We picked up OJ, rolls at the bakery, and with the instant coffee,had breakfast in the room..There is a small refrigerator in the room. Afternoon tea complimentary in bar area between 5:00PM-&7:00PM. 6) The roof top, with pool, is very nice. Cost of a beer is 6 Euro. Spa treatments avaliable, but pricey. 7) We made use of a taxi to see the various sights. Fare between 6-8 Euros. We made use of Bus 59(on the La Rambla) to get to the cable car. The cable car cost 12.5 Euro/person--round trip. Did eat at the top. Great view of the port and city. 8) For dinner we ate along the La Rambla. A number of the restaurants had a daily fixed price menu--9 Euro--3 courses. One night we went to an up scale seafood restaurant along the seafront--El Cangrejo Loco. (Crazy Crab) The upstairs had an excellent view of the sea and beach. We had salad, fish(Seabass supreme and Monk), and wine. Professionally prepared and presented. Cost was 100 Euro including tip. [--] 9) We did go to a Flamenco show with buffet dinner. Cost was 69 Euro/person. [--] Located at La Rambla 35--Walking distance from hotel. Would stay at the hotel again. Suggest you purchase a book by Rick Steves--Spain. Note: Be Careful. If you use a debit card, watch which one you use. I used a MasterCard and a Visa. If you use the Mastercard you are charged a 3% surcharge. At the ATM, if you withdraw 300 Euro, we were charged an extra 11US$. With the Visa, I was charged 1US$.

The hotel is beautiful. It's very clean, the staff speak excellent English and will answer any queries helpfully upon arrival. Right! Here's the broken down summary for those who like a thorough review. The best way I can describe it, is that it is like having complete luxury brought to your hands. You feel as though you are being treated just by being there. The maids were constantly cleaning around tables, glass (in the lift), toilets and you know that their standards are high when it comes to cleanliness. The bedroom came with en suite with toilet (and one for the men) shower, sink, shower cap, shaving foam, razor, body lotion, bubble bath, manicure set, hairdryer, robes, slippers (robe and slippers to be taken to the Spa), mini fridge, desk, box of paper and writing matrials, flat screen TV (with access to CNN and BBC News in English). The beds were very comfortable, and you are given a choice of 3 pillows to choose from, depending on which postion you sleep in. The bedding was very clean, and very contemporary. There are blankets in the cupboards incase you get a bit chilly (which we did, as the air-con came on just before we went to bed and we were unsure as to how to use the control for it). The maids did visit at about 9pm to change towels each day - which sometimes did become a little frustrating if you did want an early night they would knock until you answered the door. We did not see the need for this as we had our rooms cleaned and they changed the towels already that day, so sometimes they did not need changing. The hotel has access to the Internet and they do have a business suite however I did not visit this section of the Hotel and could not comment on the efficiency of service. Oh and in your room coffee and tea facilities are provided. Although, there are only 2 small pots of milk given and these were not replenished during our stay although other drinks sachets (i.e. coffee, tea, sugar) were. The Spa is such a fantastic thing they have on offer. We found that after a day of shopping, you would get back and feel exhaused. So to be able to use a steam room, sauna, theraputic shower and pool was like a dream come true! We found that between 7-9 the pool was empty and it felt lovely to have the peace and quiet. The pool has 2 seats, which you can sit on and activate the bubbles so that you have a kind of massage while sitting. The speed is rather fast though so you do need to hang on! The pool also has another corner dedicated to these massaging pulses of bubbles and also 2 \"fountains\" which are good for shoulder massages when standing up under them. There is also a gym facility which was also empty between 7-9pm. Towels are provided when using the Spa/Pool area but you do need to take your robe and slippers with you. There is also a shower downstairs in this area if you want to shower and change before going back to your room. The roof is also very modern and relaxing. There is a bar where all drinks are served. You can either pay there or you can charge it to your room. On one day while sitting upstairs we were given complimentary vegetable crisps to have a munch on while drinking which was an added bonus! There are sofas with cusions upstairs along with sunloungers and this was never busy so there was plenty of privacy for you, and those who prefer a topless tan (as was the case each day of our stay!). To get to the roof pool and bar, there is only 1 lift of the total 3 that get there. So if you are on the ground floor, and wanted to go to floor 7 (where it is situated) then sometimes you had to go to 6 first, then go up again to 7, which became a little tiresome. The hotel itself is situated right in the heart of La Rambia, which is a busy centre for both traffic and people. Although we could not hear the traffic or people from our rooms we could hear the music playing from the roof top bar until early hours which did actually keep me awake one night (this was without our bedroom door being open). Also our bedroom had one window, facing onto a wall of other apartment windows. We could actually see into the guest toilet opposite our apartment (not through looking, you could very easily see through) which I found a little discomfortining about the design for privacy of others. All in all an excellent stay with excellent facities and we will definately be returning", "Date": "September 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "Mrs_JT", "ReviewID": "UR8851382", "Content": "Hotel 1898 is in the most ideal location, right on the Ramblas, within walking distance of Placa de Catalunya, the port end (Colon), Placa de Gracia & the Metro station.

Great location - easy access to all major tourist spots - neighborhoods and subways. Clean and chic interiors - great amenities - roof top pool and bar is incredibly cool with great views and stylish setting - indoor spa is unique and very chic with great mix of services - solid business center - rooms are not huge - but very well thought out decorated and clean. Two pane windows so even though we had a partial view of las rambla where on the 3rd floor and the hotel next door was under construction - noise never bothered us at all. The hotel is in the mix of Las Rambla - but it feels quiet and secluded while still being right in the mix of the city. And if you don't like crowds you should not go to Barcelona any way. Easy walking distance to the Boqeuria market - the contemporary art museum - the Gothic quarter and Picasso museum - Placa Catalan and all the other major neighborhoods - plus 2 minute walk to two major subway stations that can take you anywhere you else you might want to go. I travel all the time stay at 5 star (Four Seasons etc) - this is just as good as any 5 start hotel.

They provided lots of eating recommendations and had three or four books worth of menus and pictures to help choose. The only issue was with the staff at the roof top bar who didn't seem very keen to come over and get you more drinks (although we could have gone up and got them ourselves if we weren't lounging on the big sofas in the sun!). We had a deluxe room which had it's own balcony. That was a definite advantage and we ate breakfast there each morning (although we did buy our own from the supermarket a few doors down rather than pay the 19 euros each the hotel wanted). The bathroom was a reasonable size with a lovely deep bath, and a huge shower head. Also the room was very clean and was serviced well each day. The food in the restaurant was superb and the service extremely friendly. The complimentary appetizer was delicious, and the other courses were just as good. It was the nicest restaurant we ate at although we were a bit unorganised at booking other restaurants - which is advisable if you want to go to a top level restaurant, we missed out on one promising venue because they were jam packed all evening. After reading other people's comments about the noise level from La Rambla we were a bit worried about being able to sleep.

Being No1 on trip advisor was the reason we booked this hotel. We read the very few negatives on here and this is what i think. You will always get people who are never satisfied with anything, you know the type. they are at the reception desks screaming at the staff about the slightest issue, no wonder then they get nothing sorted because lets face it, no place or event in the world is perfect and i suppose the true test of a hotel is how they react when things go slightly wrong because hey this is the reality of every day life. So firstly we got to our room, great room but right outside the elevator, based on previous comments i didnt want to settle in the room and find i could hear the elevators through the night (im a light sleeper) so we went down to reception straight away and explained.(by the way they have removed the lift bell on those floors now anyway) we got a better room issued immediately ! Result ! But you know what, if you speak politely without attitude and explain the issue, 99 times out 100, you get it sorted, and thats the point about the negatives reviews here. Next we ordered some bollinger off the menu at 80 euro's, good price i thought, when we got the bill it had 130 euro's on it, on checking the menu i had been given an old menu, no problem sir the correct price is actually 130 euro which i have to charge you but what i will give you is free drinks for the rest of the night !!!(we drunk easily more than twice the diff)- result No 2. Next morning we ordered 2 types of breakfast, they only brought one, on ringing the kitchen they apologised and the other was with us within 3 mins - result no 3. The reception were very helpful with ordering taxis( you cant be charged double going to the airport because they are all on meters NB previous review) and booking restaurants, in fact they got us into a restaurant that was full because they regularly send customers there. We didnt really do any site seeing, it was relax in the sun, wine and dine break and the hotel is perfect for that. The Ramblas outside the hotel is madness in august, it is so busy, so when you step back into the hotel it is like an Oasis of calm and tranquility, and for the previous comment about the bar been quite - what do you want when you have been in crowds of people all day ! certainly not queueing with hoards of noisy people at the bar. If your looking for the better bars and restaurants then turn left has you come out the hotel onto the Ramblas and walk couple of 100 yards up, this way you get away from all the tourists coming off the boats and getting trapped in the Ramblas restaurants which are poor food/high prices. 2 places were excellent, a traditional tapas bar called Alfonso for lunch and theTralaguz restaurant for a big night meal.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston Salem, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location...beautiful Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "jbohun", "ReviewID": "UR8462825", "Content": "Everyone has said it all already!!!

This is an extremely comfortable hotel which is fantastically well appointed. If staying in summer the ability to get away from it all and sunbathe by a roof-top pool may for many make it worthwhile in itself. There is also a well equipped gymn and OK Spa. We never had breakfast in the hotel (20 euros ahead!) but worth missing for all the excellent alternatives on the doorstep. The rooms are very comfortable and fully equipped (although the plasmas volume is set to such a low maximum volume that you can't hear them even in your own room). The gentleman who said it was a bit soulless in the bar and reception areas is correct and some of the staff (especially the bar man) could definately have done with a happy fix.

My daugher likened this hotel to an elegant cruise ship with the dark wood trim, plush carpets and brass hardware along the hallway. The room was spacious by European standards and was well equiped including very nice toiletries, bathrobes and slippers and tea service. The beds were comfortable although not plush. Internet connection was brisk and there was a good sampling of english language TV stations. The hotel is in very close proximity to the metro and around the corner from Las Ramblas although very quiet and secluded. The lobby has a tea time and cocktail hour but I never saw much action there. There is a roof top deck but my daughter and I were out exploring until late so never had a chance to use it.

It's all been said before - what more can I add?! If you arrive at the airport, just take the airport bus from immediately outside the Terminal door (3.90 Euros per person) as it takes you right into Plaza Catalunya and it's just a short walk round to La Rambla and a couple of blocks down on the right you'll find the hotel. The Hotel is actually an old building (which used to house the Philipine Tobacco company) but was beautifully restored just 2 years ago. We paid 199 Euros per night for a classic room (supposedly their most basic but it was perfect). Our room faced onto an inner courtyard and was very peaceful. To re-iterate previous reviews, all the positive points of the Hotel: location, interior design, spacious public areas, lovely rooftop terrace, beautiful rooms and bathrooms, immaculately clean. Two (very tiny) negative points - (but in no way should it stop you from booking!): the hairdryer was a bit cumbersome and awkward to use, and, while the rooftop terrace is a huge asset in a city centre hotel, the number of loungers is a bit limited. However, after a day's walking & sightseeing, this is a lovely relaxed area with cushioned benches to flop with one of their marvellous glasses of sangria! The breakfast was 19 Euros each - a bit pricey but the quality was excellent (cereals, freshest of fruit, pastries, breads, smoked salmon, cheeses, meats, omelettes made to order etc.) We also used the Royal Hotel just up the road - good value at 9 Euros but not quite the same quality. There is also a Starbucks attached to the hotel if you just fancy a coffee and a muffin one morning. Further down La Rambla, La Boqueria food market is wonderful for a walk round - and you could just pick up fresh fruit, pastries etc there! 4 restaurants tested and definitely able to recommend, none too far from Hotel 1898: 1. Can Culleretes, C/Quintana 5 (oldest restaurant in Barcelona and cheap too). 2. Taller de Tapas, C/Argenteria 51 ( very busy but good tapas). 3. Els Quatre Gats, C/Montsio3 (full of character and live music too). 4. Les Quince Nits, Plaza Reial (popular with the locals too). Things to do (some obvious!): open top bus tour (23 Euros for 2 days with Bus Turistic), walk down La Rambla watching all the street entertainment, take the lift to the top of the Columbus monument, visit some of Gaudi's buildings (Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia), visit the Museu D'Historia for a great insight into Roman Barcelona, visit Poble Espanyol to see the different Spanish styles of building and see the different crafts, tour round FC Barcelona stadium. I actually think Barcelona would be a great place to take children too - apart from the places already mentioned, there's the beach, zoo, aquarium etc!

On the positive side, the location is unbeatable, the decor beautiful and the hotel very clean. But..... We arrived well after check in time but our room was not ready and had to wait nearly half an hour for it. We were given a chit to take to the bar for a complementary drink whilst we waited. We went to the bar which was unattended, there was no bell or any way of attracting attention. We could here the staff in the room behind the bar so, after 7 or 8 minutes, we politely called out to them. We were very surprised (and shocked) when a male voice shouted back \"wait a minute\". A couple of minutes later a female opened the door, poked her head out, and again said \"wait a minute\". It was a further 2-3 minutes before we eventually were served. We booked a de-luxe room which was small, as we expected having read the reviews here, however, it was the terrace that really disappointed us. We selected the de-luxe room specifically for the terrace which was not only much smaller than expected ( the ones either side of ours were much bigger) but also instead of the stone balustrading shown in the pictures, we had a solid wall facing us which not only allowed us no view, but also made it dark and quite dingy. There was no seperate shower cubicle as some other rooms seem to have. Our room was by the elevator and there was the constant noise of the elevator pinging and of other guest laughing and joking throughout the night (fault of the room not the guests). Having missed eating one evening we discovered that room service finished at 11pm. There was absolutely no food available in the hotel after this hour. I have never before come across a hotel that couldn't russle up at least a basic sandwich, even if nothing else. Breakfast was the worst part of the experience. It was very poor but pricey (19 euros). Having sat ourselves down and having waited several minutes, we had to call the attention of one of the waiters, who had totally ignored us up to that point, to ask for tea and coffee. When it eventually came, nearly 10 minutes later, the coffee was fine but tea was a cup of hot water and a point at the teabags on the table. No milk and when requested, hot milk was brought. I should mention that the room was not even half full so there was no excuse of being busy or them being rushed off their feet. The cooked food was not only not freshly cooked, but the pre-cooked food was placed on a normal, unheated counter therefore it was barely warm and very unappetising. This is truely the worst breakfast, food and service, that I have received anywhere, including in 3rd world countries and travelodges! There were several other niggles that I won't mention now. I wondered afterwards about the great reviews that have been given here and realised that had we: 1. arrived an hour later - we would not have known that our room wasn't ready and would not have gone to the bar and experienced the problems there. 2. been allocated a different room, there are clearly better de-luxe rooms - we would not have been disappointed with the terrace. 3. been allocated a room away from the elevator - we would not have been woken up several times a night or been aware that some guest were experiencing that. 4. not missed our evening meal - we would not have wanted food at midnight therefore we would not have known that it was not available. 5. not had breakfast in the hotel - we would not have known how bad it was. Had none of the above things occurred we would have gone away having feeling that we had stayed in a well located, clean, beautiful looking hotel. We would have been unaware of the shortcomings of it, and, in ignorance, given it an undeserved very good, review. Maybe we were just unlucky with our room allocation, but unless you have been there before and specifically request to have or ask not to be given a particular room, you can't know whether you have been allocated a good or a poor room. A good hotel should offer a consistently good experience, which ever room you are in or whatever time/period you stay there in. Hotel 1898 does not offer this consistency.

The room was just OK and smaller than a typical 5-star hotel. The electrical socket in the bathroom doesn't actually do anything and when I called for help they just took my shaver and plugged it into a socket on the floor in the bedroom. Same for making morning coffee in the room. Hmm?! I paid a very high rate which did not even include breakfast. Upon check-in they went out of their way to point this out to me and that breakfast was available in their restaurant at 23 Euros. I passed. OK the location is geat but there are other properties at lower prices equally well located. Overall. I found the hotel quite pretentious but very ordinary and poor value for money. I have given a lot of thought to why the reviews of this property are so good and I can't really figure this out.

Once I had seen 1898, I kept coming back to it and booked it once I had gotten my head around paying so much for the hotel (\u00a3156 per night incl breakfast). Well, my wife and I were not disappointed - FANTASTIC. Here is the good stuff: The decor in the hotel is exquisite, so tastefully done that you could while away many hours just chilling in the lounge or bar. Our room was small but perfectly formed, really classy decor again, great bed, a choice of pillows(!), plasma tv, great bathroom etc etc. Everything you could possibly want. What made the hotel for us was actually what was above the hotel, i.e. the rooftop deck and pool - awesome. I'm afraid some of the Barcelona attractions took a back seat each day as we chilled with our sangrias by the pool, with the mild din of la rambla in the background. Yes, the drinks were expensive, but worth it in our opinion. The basement spa area was also really nice, although we only used it once because the weather was so nice! The location is also great, right on the rambla for convenience, but once inside, you would never know it. Not so good: Some people mentioned noise in their reviews which concerned me, as I am a light sleeper. I was woken two of the three nights, but that was by people coming back to their rooms. I never heard the maid service etc at all and this wouldn't stop me staying here again. Better sleepers probably woudln't have heard anything. I didn't find the staff to match up to the overall 5 stars (although still 4 stars). For example, we sent an email in advance requesting a quiet room and never got a response, and generally the level of servive could I think be a bit better. Summary Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, especially if you want to stay somewhere where you can happily spend some time relaxing, rather than charging around Barca. I would thoroughly recommend staying somewhere (if not 1898) that has a rooftop pool. Final point - due to my estensive research beforehand (AKA procrastination), I recognised quite a few hotel names as we explored Barca. Montecarlo is right opposite 1898 and looked nice from the outside - again, great location. Passed Casa Camper on last day, near the University, looked nice.

I would say the hotel is perfectly adequate for a 4 star hotel, with reasonably-sized rooms and adequate service, but perhaps not quite the \"top notch\" status as some other reviews might suggest. Although we have no real complaints about the hotel (it justifies its 4-stars), we are not convinced of the premium it seems to command. (It would, for example, have been cheaper for us to stay at the Claris, the Sofia Gran or the Hilton Diagonal Del Mar - all 5 star hotels). What you're paying for, I guess, is its very central location at the heart of town, and close to attractions/amenities such as the ramblas, the gothic quarter and near to transport links. It also has a panoramic roof terrace, with good seating and an outdoor pool (which was surprisingly warm at this time of year), as well as a small (and stone cold) indoor pool and spa. However, there is only one restaurant, and one bar (based round the lobby) and one cafe (not counting the resident Starbucks). The restaurant is competitively priced (at least in hotel terms), but was surprisingly devoid of guest, as it is very easy to eat out (which we did on a couple of nights). The breakfast buffet has a diverse range, and is good value if included in your booking. Overall, this is a competent and well-located hotel, particularly if you can get a competitive rate (which was hard for us, even three months out). However, for the price of 230 euros/\u00a3160, it's not quite in the same league as (for example) the Plaza in New York, Claridges in London, or the Shangri La's in Asia. (It's more akin to the Malmaison boutique chain in the UK - but perhaps costing slightly more, with fewer extra touches.) Having said this, though, our stay was pleasant and comfortable, and our only complaint (if that's the right word), is that they sting you 16 euros to advertise one of their flaky umbrellas when it rains. (Guests staying in the hotel opposite were treated to complimentary \"Meridien\" golf umbrellas.) As for Barcelona, if this is rated as one of the best hotels, then all the other 4 (and 5) star hotels in the city must be considerably wanting. We observed that, although we speak three different languages, it definitely helps to speak Spanish (and specifically the local Catalonian dialect), else you tend to be treated as a second-class citizen with all but the most service-conscious locals (who are few and far between, from our experience). Petty theft in the area also seems surprisingly common - we even met a well-travelled couple who got their handbag/purse stolen by thieves who threw pidgeon poo at them (and used it as a distraction for robbing them).", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chelmsford, UK", "Title": "\u201cA good hotel located at the centre of the action\u201d", "Author": "TSYChelmsfordUK", "ReviewID": "UR7380407", "Content": "The 1898 is a good, modern, efficient hotel located at the top of La Rambla.

The rooms have wooden floors so you hear people walking about in the rooms above and beside you, the areas besides the elevators were marble with the same result and the \"bing\" everytime the elevators stopped at our floor was also a bit loud. I'd reserved the room directly with the hotel in early January and requested an early check-in but when we arrived we were told that it wasn't possible because it was a busy weekend - it was 11.45am Friday morning.

In fact, I'm writing this at 2am the night before a long trans-Atlantic flight back to the States because I can't sleep! It sounds like there's a club in my room ... it's so loud that I can sing along with the music when my head isn't about to explode from the club beat. Apparently, there's a nearby club that literally \"rocks the house\" on the weekends. BTW, they're currently playing \"Flashdance\" so the club has questionable music taste. The hotel itself is reasonably nice but the service doesn't match the decor. Other reviewers have noted the location but, believe me, there are lots of hotels in the same location to choose from - it doesn't have to be this one. My primary purpose of being in Barcelona was business and, as such, my key complaints are those of a business traveler looking for service and efficiency ... definitely not what I found: (1) I wasn't offered a map of the city when I checked in (2) I had problems with temperature control in my room. I spent a couple of warm days in the room before calling the front desk to look at the AC, which they said was turned off .... why, they couldn't say. It certainly wasn't obvious the AC was turned off because it's tucked into a side of the closet that requires a sleuthing operation to find. (3) The hair dryer is one of the worst I've ever seen ... It feels like no exagerration to say it weighs a ton and you have to hold down the button continually to keep the dryer on. I had dents in my thumbs after I finished drying my hair. (4) In general, I had a lot of problems with noise .... there was a lot of hammering away in different parts of the hotel during the day and housekeeping was always really loud. I had to call the front desk twice about noise just so I could sleep away some jet lag for 1 hour in the late afternoon. (5) It's impossible to get a taxi at the hotel. This is a real issue for people staying at the hotel for business reasons. I was late to a conference 2 days in a row because it took so long to get a taxi. The hotel apparently has no special relationships with taxi companies. (6) I had to call the front desk to get information on accessing the Internet. I don't understand why this wouldn't be explained at check-in or on a sheet/placard in the room. I spent 5-10 minutes searching for this information in the room before I finally gave up and called the front desk. (7) The hotel gym is missing one of the set of two weights that I use in my workouts. The weight was missing all week so it didn't seem like anyone was in a hurry to replace it. This may seem like a minor issue, but it added up to a general inattention to the detail that creates a good hotel experience.", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic - a great hotel in a brilliant location\u201d", "Author": "Rebecca004", "ReviewID": "UR7245666", "Content": "What a great hotel.

We did spend a couple of hours in the basement spa pool and had it all to ourselves which was wonderful. We had booked a classic room which is listed as having an inner atrium courtyard view, however, when we shown to our room 606, on the 6th floor, we actually had an outside view, overlooking some of the private terraces of the rooms below. It wasn't a bad view by any means and as we were expecting an inside room then to have an outside view and be able to see the sun was a bonus. The room was lovely, very clean, king size bed, minibar (for which the prices were very reasonable), kettle, bathrobe and slippers. I had pre-ordered a bottle of Cava to be brought to the room and this was delivered within 5 mins of being shown to the room. It did take us a few minutes to work out how the shower worked and it was a day before we realised there was an aircon control in the cupboard. The room became stiffling hot and we thought the aircon was not working. We called recepton and someone was at the door within 2 minutes to show us how to work the aircon unit. The breakfast was divine, there was so much to chose from although I wouldn't be able to justify paying 18 euros each so thankfully this was incuded in the rate we paid for the room. Our only real critisism is the cost of the drinks in the bar. Yes you expect them to be on the expensive side but 25 euros for 2 glasses of sangria is a bit on the steep side and we didn't order any more drinks in the bar after that. Also there is a distict lack of English TV channels. Dont get me wrong, we weren't there to watch TV, but a couple of nights were shattered after all the walking we did and it would have been nice to go back and chill in the room after dinner and watch a film.

A few eating out tips - Bar Ra behind the market is great for breakfast (as is the market itself), the bar next to the hotel is FAB and you can dance until 3am but don't eat in the Taxidermista restaurant (it was in our guide book as recommended but we thought it was terrible).

The bathroom was amazing, the hotel slippers and bath robes were a great touch and there was a plentiful array of toileteries! The best parts about the hotel had to be the spa downstairs - beautiful swimming pool with theraputic water beds, lovely steam room and sauna - and the amazing roof terrace with heated swimming pool (which we managed to go in at about 5pm at night, which shows how warm it was considering its February!). We had breakfast twice, (19 euros regardless of whether you stick to continental or not) the selection is amazing but it is overpriced.

The room was a good size and the terrace at around 12ft by 12ft, containing 2 sun loungers and table/chairs for 4 people was superb. This type of room is on the 5th floor and is overlooked by non-terrace rooms on the 6th floor. We overlooked a side street so the noise of La Ramblas was only background when on the terrace and non-existant inside the room itself. The room was always spotless, the highest level of cleanliness I have ever come across in a hotel. The staff even come back to the room in the early evening to check on the room and turn down the bed. The bathroom is large and has a great shower. Bathrobes and slippers are also provided. Although the rooftop pool is unheated and a bit small, it is adequate for a splash around and there is plenty of space on the roof to stretch out and relax in the everlasting sun. The communal spa facilities inside the hotel are also a bit small, but if you time it right you can get pretty much exclusive use of the steam bath and sauna. Breakfast is extra at 18 euros per person. The buffet is vast and fresh, catering for all tastes, the only comment being that if you go in the last 90 minutes of breakfast (after 9:30am) availability of food and cutlery etc. becomes restricted and the tables begin to get closed as the staff set up for lunch quite early. So be prepared to share a table with other guests! It can take a while too to get served coffee at breakfast - it can take up to 30 minutes and a few repeated requests until the coffee appears, but on one day we only had to wait 5 minutes. The one day we decided to have breakfast served on the terrace in our room. For no extra cost, you get a choice of four breakfasts, selected by ticking the options on a card that is hung outside the room the night before. Unfortunately for us, it turned out to be a poor experience as the breakfast arrived very late, we had less than half the breakfast delivered and had to wait a further 40 minutes for the rest to come. When it did arrive, the order was still not complete. The evening meal at the hotel restaurant was superb and worth the money, though the hotel did bump up the bill by adding extra glasses of wine that we had not ordered. Following a few recommendations on TripAdvisor, we tried \"The Attic\" restaurant over the road from the hotel. The food was pretty good and fairly priced compared to the rest of La Ramblas, but they tried the age old trick of adding extra items to the bill and when you ask for the bill out comes a round of coffee. After over 40 minutes of asking for the bill half a dozen times and dodging the coffee, we eventually settled up at the correct price. We did have a problem with the guests in the room next door throwing food on our terrace and one night a lit cigarette thrown onto our terrace whilst we were asleep did cause some minor damage. But the hotel was receptive to our concerns and also responded to a post midnight loud music complaint very well indeed. Again, credit to Jordi!

I stayed there in early September in a \"superior\" room for a week and was not disappointed (overall). Highlights: 1: Decent rooms (but I was glad I followed other reviewers' advice to book a \"superior\" room - it costs more for a reason - its usually a room on the outside of the hotel as opposed to the smaller standard rooms overlooking the inner atrium. The standard rooms' dark walls and small dimensions suffer further from the dingy atrium that restricts most of the natural light). Our room was at the back of the hotel with a balcony overlooking a cafe - not a great view, but pleasant and much quieter than those overlooking the Ramblas. 2: Decent Spa in the basement. Not great when kids were allowed in (supervised), but very quiet in the mornings and early afternoons. The pool wasn't very large (the picture on the hotel's own web-site was accurate), and could do with being warmer, but it was ok in conjunction with the steam room and sauna and there were several spa treatments available. 3: Very nice roof terrace. Although the pool was unheated and you needed to get there early (late afternoon) to grab a large sofa or four-poster bed sun lounger on the west side of the building to catch the last of the sun. 4: 24 hour internet access - albeit in the business centre on the 1st floor. Lowlights: 1: Variable customer service - usually very pleasant but hardly overeager. They have a concierge service but nowhere near the level of service of some other hotels (although this is after all only four star) - they were fairly unenthusiastic when asked to phone a restaurant to tell them we were delayed; and room service also seemd a bit put out about being called after they had overlooked re-supplying tea and coffee! Having said that, I did ask them to arrange for flowers, wine and fruit to be in our room on arrival, which they did, and I was never charged !(surely a mistake). 2: The hotel food was hardly much to rave about. The hotel breakfast is only worth the price if you can eat your weight in breakfast items - we found it much better and infinitely cheaper to buy anything we wanted in the supermarket over the road from the side entrance of the hotel. 3: Availability of food and drinks on the roof terrace was limited. Again, the opening hours of the bar varied a great deal and you were better off taking your own drinks and food up there - a bit of a hassle in a four star hotel! 4: You had to call room service for hot water or milk and there no irons were provided, only an ironing service - ok if you trust your clothes to someone else, but far from convenient when you're in a rush to get out - suffice to say the travel kettle and iron other reviwers advised came in really handy! Those gripes aside, the hotel is very well located, even if the Ramblas is a little tacky. We had no hassles from any beggars, and never felt unsafe at any time of the day or night even though we were often returning at 3 or 4 am. Overall, the hotel was well worth the money which is probably why its so popular even though its not a 5 star hotel. Having seen other hotels I was about to book - Casa Camper (dark, dingy and inhospitable!) and Hotel Neri, where I popped in for a few drinks as friends were staying there, I was not disappointed. A few Barcelona recommendations: Breakfast in the cafes at the rear of the hotel (on Carrer del Carme); great tapas at, \"Taller de Tapas\" near Santa Maria del Mar church, and even better pancakes around the corner on Passeig del Born. Clubs: Danzatoria in Tibidabo (food and wine was really good although expensive, the club attracts a well-heeled 20 to 30 crowd and is spread over a garden area and several floors of a mansion type house, with a pretty wide range of music (for Spain!)), Shoko is a bit more \"low rent\" as its in the Port Olimpic area on the beachfront, but is one of the better clubs there. Club 13 / Tarantos in Placa Real was a lot grittier, but the live bands and largely local crowd make it well worth a visit. Try the web-site [--] for more. Idling away a few hours (or days) in el Born's boutique antique, gift and clothes shops was fantastic, as was visiting Gaudi's Sagrada Familia and Casa Mila, but I would avoid the more touristy shops and restaurants on the Ramblas (including \"Attic\" restaurant across the road from the hotel - it comes recommended by some but the service and food was pretty poor quality), as well as any restaurant on Carrer de la Princesa (poor quality overpriced seafood) or anywhere in Port Olimpic (although if you want a quick snack at a \"subway\" or \"Pizza Hut\" Port Olimpic is the place to go!!) The Maremagnum shopping centre in Port Vell is also full of tacky gifts and high street rubbish. Cabs are not too expensive, but the metro was ideal - it was cleaner, cheaper and more frequent than the london tube and usually quicker than a cab if you don't mind not seeing the sights as you travel. The 3 official guided bus tours that start from Placa de la Catalunya are also well worth a try. If you have time, a tour on each takes around 2-3 hours or so, and you get to see virtually everything you need.", "Date": "October 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel in best location\u201d", "Author": "pedro3gb", "ReviewID": "UR5954502", "Content": "A 5 minute walk from the airport bus stop leads you to this new hotel at the top end of The Ramblas - right opposite Le Meridien.

Farrgi is a good bet for this. Alternatively try one of the half slices of paw paw, dragon fruit or mango wrapped with spoon from thye market just down the street.

Other great touches- a pillow menu, minibar, flat screen TV (family friendly channels), mood lighting. Our room 206 had its own mini terrace with dining table so you were able to eat out there or smoke if you are a smoker. I would not recommend this particular room for children therefore. Of course, if you get bored of fiddling with the mood lighting, you can always take a dip in one of the hotel`s 2 pools- the rooftop pool with views over the city and mountains, or the basement pool with its mood lighting and hydro beds!

The rooms were much smaller than Monte Carlo but it was large enough to meet our needs. We were in a premium room with a small balcony that overlooked Las Ramblas and there was absolutely NO street noise when the balcony door was closed. I did see some interior rooms that were very small so booking premium for a few dollars more is definitely worth it. I don't understand how Le Meridian gets away with charging so much more for their rooms when 1898 is directly across the street for so much less. We ate dinner at their restaurant one night and it was definitely gourmet quality, a little expensive but the ambience made it well worth it. The drinks on the rooftop patio were around 12E each, but they were large enough to qualify for two drinks and they did not skimp on the alcohol.

It's a fantastic hotel - in many respects a 5* experience, though perhaps falling short of an official rating on one or two technicalities. Things that you may find useful when considering booking are : * Roof Terrace - Gloriously quiet with panoramic views of the city, nice bar, but no food. (note you can zip out and get a salad in 5 minutes and bring it back without any eyebrows raised!) *Concierge - are very efficient and booked us into some \"unbookable\" restaurants at short notice (including Moo which is a must if you want to indulge!). Also left a note in our room confirming this had been done * Location - is possibly as good as it gets. You can pretty much get anywhere you need with ease. Bus-service reliable and easy to work out. We explored a lot and the only cabs we got were to and from the airport. * Agree with the earlier post about the noise from the maids which is quite loud (but the earliest we heard was 9.00am and our room was right opposite one of their base rooms). The rooms were spotless though. * Spa - Pool small but fun, sauna and steam rooms both fine, clean etc. Again if you want to indulge massages were very good. * Price - in response to the other poster who said that the hotel charges for everything, i'm a little surprised. True that there is no kettle in the room but my wife and I asked a few times at the bar for hot water and milk which was provided for no extra cost. Maybe it was the room service delivery element that caused them to be charged. Also, breakfast cost is pretty competitive for a hotel of this standard and of good quality.

We stayed there for three nights in mid August before a cruise. We picked it based on the reviews we had read here and we were not disappointed. The Room: We had opted for one of the Deluxe rooms with a balcony. I don\u2019t know if it was just the luck of the draw or if it was because we mentioned it was our honeymoon but we ended up with a room with a giant balcony (it was much larger than the neighbouring ones). It had a double lounger, two single loungers and a table that could have sat eight. It would have been very easy for us to throw a party out there had we wanted too. It made for a welcome retreat when the roof top lounge area was crowded. The room itself was great. It was a good size although not particularly large. It was very clean and stylish. The flat panel tv was a nice touch as well as a good space saver. Our bathroom was surprisingly bog with both a bathtub and a separate shower stall. The Hotel: All the public areas were just amazing. The lobby was very luxurious. The roof top pool area had great views and lots of their loungers. Being at the spa pool was like swimming in a wine cellar and seats with the water jets were just the thing after a hot day of sight seeing. The Service: We had absolutely no complaints about the service. When we arrived they were able to give us our room right away even though it was 11:30 and check in wasn\u2019t supposed to be until 3:00. Because it was our honeymoon they sent up a complementary bottle of Cava. The clerks at the front desk were very helpfully with restaurant recommendations and directions. Also, on our first night there the air conditioning mysteriously stopped working in the middle of the night. We called the front desk and we had someone there looking at it in less than five minutes and luckily he was able to fix the problem about as quickly. Food: The only food we had at the hotel was the special Hotel 1898 breakfast, which we ordered form room service on our last day. It was pricey but it was a tonne of food and done very nicely. We didn\u2019t eat at the restaurant mainly because the menu was a little ordinary and we wanted to sample the Catalan cuisine. Other reviews had mentioned the Attic that was right across the street from Hotel 1898. We really enjoyed it. The food was fantastic and the prices were incredibly reasonable. Quibbles: Our only real complaint with our stay there was that we had a service door next to our room that banged loudly whenever it closed. This was not a problem at night but was disturbing when sleeping late or napping. A more minor complaint was that the air conditioner controls were inside of the closet and very hard to read. A flashlight would have come in handy. Also, be aware that bar in the lobby is very expensive compared to bars along La Ramblas. Overall we loved our stay at the Hotel 1898.

This brings me to one important point for all of you who are spoiled by 5 star services. They really do not offer this. It is really a 4 star and sometimes even a 3 star. The reception staff is 6 stars, really, but the rest is...mmm. Roomservice do not want to bring any food or drinks to the roofterras. The bar on the roofterras is not opened until 1700!!! although there inroom brochure says it is opened from 1200 to 0100. So no service at all at the roof and the splonge pool is only 1.20 deep and very small. In the evening for drinks; no music, no barsnacks, no nuts, no glory, no atmosphere. To bad, cause it has potential! The bathroom is small and has no seperate shower. It's good, not excellent. They do not speak english at the health/beauty club and it is short of staff, so no pedicures for us. This is a great hotel when you book the room with the outside lounge erea.

The facilities were next to none, with the pool and bar area on the roof especially enjoyable in the Catalonian sunshine.

All of the fixtures and fittings are of a very high quality and our room had a large wall mounted flat screen tv. When I travel on business I don't usually order breakfast , as I always find it to be over-priced and/or dissapointing. The breakfast at the 1898, however, was very good value for money (\u20ac18) and the food was both excellent and plentiful. The only (very minor) critisism that I would have, was that although the price of most drinks at the bar was average for this type of hotel, (e.g. a G&T was about \u20ac8, a beer about \u20ac4), when I ordered two glasses of sangria at the pool bar the price came to a whopping \u20ac25, which I think is highly overpriced for cheap red wine with lemonade!

It was around the same price as some of the more traditional hotels on La Ramblas but you got so much more for your money.

As it is located on La Rambla, we were concerned about noise and had therefore requested an interior standard room. We were shown to our room on the third of six floors, which had two large outward opening windows overlooking a small inner courtyard with potted plants at the base. Because of that, the room was a little darker than exterior rooms or those exterior with terraces, but we preferred that over potential street noise. Location was great, though in a very touristy area. You can walk to all of the main points of interest, and we did not have any trouble hailing a cab either. One real bonus is the Boquiera Market, which is about a block further down La Rambla -- incredible outdoor covered market for meats, seafood, fruits, bar-style restaurants. We bought some food there and brought it back to the room one day. Do watch for pick pockets there and on La Rambla generally, as you would in any highly congested area where it is easy to get distracted by all of the goings on. Spain overall felt very safe, certainly safer than large cities in the US, but like anywhere petty crimes of opportunity will occur. The hotel occupies what was formerly the headquarters for Compania de Tabacos de Filipinas, which was built in 1881. It was completely redone 8 months ago and provides an interesting mix of very modern high-end furnishing and wall treatments but the original fascade, high ceilings (in rooms too) and ornate details. Because it is so new, it has not yet been written up in the guidebooks; however, I expect that when the new editions come out that this hotel will be right at the top. While we paid 150 euros per night without breakfast, a room of our standard room's quality combined with the overall luxe feel of the hotel and its full range of amenities would easily fetch $350-450/night in San Francisco or New York. The rooftop deck, which has a very modern lounge-y feel with built-ins and other freestanding seating areas, is lovely with views out over the city in all directions. It was especially welcome in the evenings during our stay becauses it was so hot during the day. The pool located on rooftop is on the small side, but nice for cooling off and lazing around. On the floor below the streel-level reception desk is another pool/spa facility, which is pretty amazing. Apparently the stone and brickwork arched ceiling over that pool is part of the original building and was uncovered during the renovation. It feels like you are in ancient roman bath or a wine cave, but the new pool itself, which is larger than the rooftop pool, has jacuzzi jets, two overhanging waterfall type fixtures, and two stainless steel lounge chairs that are submerged in the water with pinhole jets in the backs/seats. There is an adjacent steam room and sauna, as well as a glass enclosed air-conditioned exercise room with treadmill, etc. Plenty of towels, water, changing facilities, etc. All of the above is free to hotel guests. The rooms were handsomely decorated (peeked in a few others while being cleaned), complete with large plasma tvs with good array of English channels, in-room music system, and room lighting that allows you to dim the lights to various levels at the touch of a button (modes: welcome, relax, reading, nighttime). The bathroom was all forest green marble with both hand-held shower hose and rainfall showerhead. It was initally a bit confusing to figure out how to go from tub faucet, to hand-held, to rainfall mode. There is a towel warming rack, which was great for laundry. Plenty of toiletries, hair dryer, etc. In closet safe, fridge, etc. I couldn't, however, get an iron when I inquired about it, though they did have laundry service. They offer pillow service as well, which I tried. The room came equipped with hypoallergenic synthetic pillows, two each: one longer bolster-type and then one larger European square pillow. The card in the room offers several other pillows, including down and memory foam. We tried those two, and the housekeeping staff left the originals as well, so we could go back and forth between them. As others have noted, the rooms have two twins pushed together, which does appear to be common in Spain. It makes for spacious king, but isn't ideal. Air conditioning, which we needed worked very well. However, there was a consistent intermittent mild bonking noise, which we finally realized only occurred when the air was on. I would imagine that it was specific to our room, and it wasn't a big deal. There is a large, nicely decorated computer room -- think clubby with sofas, music, great lighting, magazines while you wait. There are two computers with printers, all free of charge. There is no concierge to speak of, though the reception desk attempts to fill that roll. The front desk employees' affect could afford to be a bit more friendly, but they weren't actually negative or surely. I guess I would summarize their mode as slightly cool. Overall, one of the nicest hotels that I have stayed in; hip but not at the expense of comfort. I'd definitely go back and highly recommend it. I wish that every city that I visit had a hotel as nice as this one and at similar rates. While there are three rooms with private pools on the corners of the fifth floor, and others with private terraces, I wouldn't hesitate to stay in a standard interior room as we did, as the overall hotel amenities are so wonderful that you will be very happy with the communal outdoor areas. The hotel is not cuurently very busy from what I can gather, which I think is due to the fact that it is so new. It would an overnight success in Manhattan or LA, or any urban setting in the US for that matter. Best way to book, according to the hotel, is as we did, through their website nnhotels.es. They have several hotels in Barcelona, including Hotel Jazz, which is also highly rated by tripadvisor reviewers.

The view from the terrace (we were on the fifth floor) was great and there were table and chairs, and padded benches to sit on and laze around. We requested a bottle of champagne in our room for arrival, and this was done without any fuss, they even sent me the champagne list in advance so that I could choose. The room was lovely, the bathroom fantastic, believe everything everyone is saying about the shower - absolutely great, nothing like anything I've seen in the UK. The lighting in the room was also very good with four levels of lighting available. Despite others' comments, we did have breakfast in the hotel on two mornings. I felt that it compared very well in price to the breakfasts in full service hotels in the UK, and there was a great variety in the buffet (though the cakes looked a little rich for that early in the morning!!) The concierge was very helpful in supplying us with a map of Barcelona, even going so far as to point out which roads to avoid in the midday sun, and which ones had the best shade. We did have a slight issue with the bar service on the Saturday evening. Before we went out to eat, we thought it would be nice to have a drink in the bar, but the bar team member did not acknowledge us, and we waited, and even though he was attending to someone else, he did not even acknowledge us, or smile, or say hello, so we decided to go somewhere with a little more friendliness and warmth. The only other issue we had was on our last night, when we could hear running water, and so we couldn't sleep. The night porter came to our room, and heard the noise, but was unable to solve the problem (still not sure what it was, could have been coming from room above?) but he did offer us a room move, but as we were checking out in the morning, we declined. He handled it well, but no mention of a reduction in the rate to compensate our wakeful night. Still, we did love this hotel, the roof terrace is great, with fantastic views, and a good opportunity to relax after walking around a very hot Barcelona.

The hotel is superb- set in a great location and the rooftop pool is awesome.

However when I was shown to my room (room 510) after waiting 20 minutes, it was small, dark and awkwardly shaped, and looked nothing like the images on their website. A bed was pushed up against the tiny window making the room even darker. I checked the floorplan on the door and this room was indeed smaller than the other internal rooms as it was on the corner by the lifts, so I called reception to change the room. As no other Classic rooms were available I had to pay an extra 50 euros per night for the privilege but the Superior room ( room 635) I now had was terrific \u2013 light, bright and airy with a street view. The hotel 1898 have no dedicated concierge- and I was told that all the reception staff could assist with any query, but when I asked them to recommend a restaurant for dinner I was sent to an overpriced tourist trap on the beach with terrible food and awful service. This wasn\u2019t helped by the inaccurate directions they provided. Taxis also seem to be quite difficult for them to organise (perhaps due to the location), but we were always kept waiting ages or were advised to walk. If you're looking for a great - and cheap - seafood restaurant, then try La Paradeta on C/Comercial 7 about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Superb seafood, served refectory style. Choose from glistening mounds of clams, mussels, squid, spider crabs and whatever else the boats have brought in, let them know how you\u2019d like it cooked (grilled, steamed or a la marinera), pick a sauce, buy a drink and wait for your number to be called. . I would recommend Hotel 1898 as a great place to stay, especially for the wonderful rooftop terrace and the central location but don\u2019t ask the staff for tips or advice and make sure they don\u2019t put you into one of the small and dark corner rooms on the inner courtyard.

I need to set the context for this trip. It was our 11th wedding anniversary on June 24 2006. My wife and I have been together since we were both 19 years old; we have been together for about 20 years \uf04a This was our first visit to Barcelona and I had planned this as a surprise trip. My wife knew that we were going somewhere, but she did not know exactly where. As we drove up the M1 and she thought we were heading for the Lake District or something like that. Flights Ryan Air - 10/10 you pay for what you get. We flew from Luton Airport to Reus, with Ryan Air. Both out-bound and return flights were on time and trouble free. My wife didn\u2019t even know where we were when the plane touched down at Reus. She thought we were in South of France because the pilot mentioned the Pyrenees. It was really funny (by the way I did not blind fold her, but she did have to wear headphones and promise not to look at any of the flight display boards). On both flights we managed to get window seats, sitting together! By the way this was not by fluke. If you don\u2019t know the form, here are some tips on what to do: \u2022Check in desk - Get in the Queue before the check in desk actually opens. This will increase your chance on getting a boarding number between 1-90. If you get there about 2 hours and 15 minutes before the flight you should get you a good number. \u2022Check in early \u2013 The check in desk opens two hours before the scheduled flight. Have your photo ID with you and a copy of the email from Ryan Air confirming your flight. \u2022In the departure lounge sit near the gate, they call you up by number order, Families with kids first and then boarding card numbers 1-90, the 91-180. Gate 2 (Luton) Out-bound and Gate 5 (Reus) Return. If you are brave enough, start queuing up about 5 minutes before they actually tell you to. This will increase your chances to getting on the plane early. \u2022From there on it\u2019s a foot race, so wear your running shoes \uf04a A coach runs from Reus \u2013 Sant Station and Sant Station \u2013 Reus; the coach timetable coincides with the Ryan Air Flights. Cost 18 Euros return trip. 1898 Hotel: 10/10 (it is more 4 \u00bd star than 4, but not quite 5 star) \u2022Brilliant location, \u2022Lovely interior, petty good quality finish and I am a construction manager by profession.! \u2022Helpful staff / professional Marti, Adrian and I think Laura - they gave us a map of Barcelona and advised us where to visit. They even made and confirmed restaurant reservations for us. \u2022Brilliant facilities \u2013 I loved the roof terrace! Check the views \u2022Room 206 \u2013 rear facing court yard balcony - rooms 201 \u2013 206 I think have balconies \u2022Quite to sleep in a night and well sound proofed, it was even quite when the balcony door was open. \u2022Biggest shower head you will ever see! \u2022Shower was easy to use \u2013 although from previous reviews some people struggled to works it out. \u2022Top tap turns the shower and bath tap, off and on, but you have to depress the button to switch between the shower and bath \u2022Middle tap \u2013 temperature \u2022Bottom tap \u2013 mini shower head \u2022\u20ac2.00 for 200ml of water from the mini bar (steep), so go to the sweet shop on the opposite side of the road on La Ramblas, about 300m down heading towards the harbour. \u20ac1.30 for a big bottle and keep it in the fridge. Top quality hotel\u2026.I will not be staying anywhere else if I return. Central and you won\u2019t have to waste your time travelling too and from the hotel. Restaurants & Clubs we visited: 7 Portes Restaurant \u2013 it\u2019s not all that great Rating = 6/10 I booked this with Top Table before we left. I hear it is the oldest restaurant in Barcelona. Lovely establishment, with smartly dressed waiters, poor service (our fault \u2013 had we spoke Spanish we might have had a better experience); the manageress spoke good English but the waiters did not. Average food \u2013 the menu sounds better that the actual quality of the food. Despite the non English waiters, had the food been tastier the restaurant would have 9/10, the food let it down. La Vinateria del Call \u2013 Great Tapas Traditional Catalonia Tapas bar Rating = 9 /10 La Vinateria del Call is Located in the Gothic area about 3 minutes from the square. Don\u2019t be put off by the way it looks from the outside. The staff are warm and helpful and Jordi spoke very good English (they have English menus). The Catalonian house table wine was about \u20ac7.00 a bottle and we even purchased a bottle for \u20ac6.00 to take back to our hotel. We had stuffed mussels, stuffed mushrooms, mixed minced/ground meats (hot dish), tomato bread, mixed Tortia and wine. We were the only English speaking people in the restaurant, as this is a place where Catalonians go to eat, traditional (although I heard that Tapas is not a traditional Catalonian dish). Jamboree -Club We boogied on Saturday night, got to Jamboree about 1:30am in the morning after dinner at 7 Portes and a stroll down the beach. The music was Hip-Hop (some old school), little bit of R&B. Worth visiting if you like black music. Upstairs \u2013 was pop and disco, it was packed on both floors and the crowd were cool. Sight we visited: La Sagrada Familia \u2013 Still under construction and another 33 Years left, brilliant architectural detail. Guell Park\u2013 Get off a Vallecara Station (to experience the 600m walk up stairs and outside escalators; it\u2019s a trek so you have to be fit to make it; I have ever been up a road sooooo steep). Lessop Station on the other hand is an easier and a more casual stroll to the park, better if you have a medical condition, but it is about 1200m away. La Ramblas\u2013 Nothing much to see, except for watching the world do pass you by whilst sipping on Sangria , lots of food places to choose from, the market is near and so is the Gothic Area and La Ramblas leads down to the beach and harbour The Beach & Harbour \u2013 only visited this at night after eating at the 7 Portes restaurant, look great at night but not too sure what it looks like during the day. All in all, 1898 is awesome establishment. The Le Meridian (opposite) is probably as good, but probably twice the price.

The room was large and looked out on what appeared to be an alleyway. I believe there was some sort of small restaurant with a patio there, and there was occasional noise as a result. However, it was generally very quiet, and I'm not especially worried about the view. The furnishings and decor are contemporary, though the materials used seem fairly simple. There was a very comfortable king-size bed with nice linens and various pillows to choose from. To their credit, hotel management has installed hardwood floors in the entryway and main room. Air conditioning was excellent and the closet was large. There was a flat-panel wall-mounted LCD TV. The lighting, in its various settings, can be controlled from the bed. The bathroom is nicely done in green stone and was very roomy. Huge towels, constantly replenished toiletries (including toothbrush/toothpaste, razor/shaving cream, and the usual other supplies), plush bathrobes and disposable slippers were provided. The showerhead is about the size of a dinner plate and water pressure and temperature were excellent. There is a restaurant which is really not too bad. I had dinner a couple of times and found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The food, while not wildly creative (go to Abac, Moo, Cinc Sentits, Comer\u00e7 24, etc. for that), was tasty and featured good ingredients and simple preparations. I didn't spend a great deal of time interacting with the staff or using the spa. The lobby area is somewhat dark but tastefully decorated.

My husband and I stayed with our 16 year old daughter and her friend. We treated ourselves to a \"privilage room\" and the girls had a \"classic\". Our room was about 50% bigger than theirs and had a beautifully large bathroom and overlooked the street, which in truth we didn't really look out at much! The girls room overlooked an inner courtyard and they said the room did feel quite dark most of the time. As other reviews have said the showers are fantastic, but hey they're only 8 months old, hope the standards keep up. Air conditioning was also very efficient. Needless to say the girls made great use of the spa facilites and the rooftop pool and sun lounge area was just out of this world especially after a hard days sight seeing. The breakfast is definitely worthwhile if you have the capacity for big breakfasts, otherwise it's an expensive waste when there are so many cafes etc right on your doorstep. Breakfast in the market is a must. The location too was perfect for us as we wanted to let the girls have as much freedom to explore on their own as sensibly possible, which they successfully did. We decided to eat in Attic, which is opposite the hotel, on our last night. It's a large restaurant and we arrived at about 8.30, quite early by Barcelona standards, they had a lot of empty tables including most of the window ones, but the girls had walked up the stairs first and requested a table for 4 and were being shown to a table right at the back of the restaurant, I asked if it was possible to have a table in the window at which I was told they were all reserved! I must admit my back went up immediately as he was not prepared to offer any other table, so I said thank you but not for us and went to walk out. Needless to say the maitre de stopped the waiter and asked why we were leaving and hey presto we got a table in the window. These tables were not reserved as we sat near the entrance and plenty of other people came in without reservations and got shown straight to these tables. After this minor glitch though I have to say the food and service were great.

Both of us travel quite alot and have stayed in 5 star hotels on numerous occasions. Hotel 1898 is every bit as good as any 5 star hotel and was magical from the moment we stepped into the foyer - very modern unique chic decor. The Charlie Chaplin slient movies playing on the LCD screen in the lobby is a novelle idea. We had a delux room on the 3rd floor that overlooked the street, as the windows were sound proofed we never heard any traffic at night. Although satellite TV, Sky News was about the only chanel in english. Bathroom was very large with beautiful marble work - bathrobe and slippers for both of us and they were very generous with restocking the toiletries every day. Down side if you want to have a tea or coffee you must order the hot water and as is often the case in warm climates - it wasn't very hot! The staff were all very helpful and were always smiling and polite.. The jacuzzi was wonderful, as was the indoor pool (although on the small side) and the sauna just perfect for relaxing on holiday. My boyfriend is a major Starbucks fan and was delighted to have one next door to the hotel - there's even a Dunken Doughnuts open 24 hrs a day a few doors down. Breakfast is definitely best from the market - again only 3 min walk from the hotel. Ours tended to be an unhealthy mix of delicious fruits and decadent chocolates!! Hotel is in a central location right on Las Rambles - within 10 min walk of the port area and only 2 mins from Placa Cataluyna where you can get a \"hop-on-hop-off\" city tour bus every 10 mins.
