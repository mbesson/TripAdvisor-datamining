TV is not functioned at all luckily got chance to change another room. After that we realized that there was no air-conditioned during mid night. This is not the way to operate a business, kind of cheating to the customer.

Instead, our rooms had no windows! In addition, there was no thermostat in the room to control the air conditioning. When we went to the reception desk at 3am in the morning, the receptionist (only one of them was on duty at night) was sleeping. His service was atrocious, giving me the I don't want to serve you kind of look and attitude. He was reluctant to even turn on our aircon in our room.The rooms were extremely filthy. We started getting rashes on the second day. Not knowing the reason, we continued our stay. Just an hour before check out, we noticed that the beddings were very dirty. There were BLOODSTAINS and holes in our bedsheet. The towel looks like a cleaning rag (we're not sure even if they used it for other purposes). The images on its website are deceptive. They took a whole picture of a building, seemingly representing the hotel. Instead, the hotel is only a small crook of the building. Rooms are so close together and walls are so thin. I'm pretty sure you can get better rooms by staying at backpackers at a quarter of the price. DO NOT STAY HERE! Unless you want to pay extras for medical fees for your rashes. Please, don't let your dream holidays be crushed...", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR902879626", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "hfdakfkjla"}, {"Content": "Don't stay here!!! Absolutely terrible!! Booked two rooms, one room had no windows and the wall was next to an industrial airconditioner which made the walls vibrate and couldn't sleep. The other room had a hole in the ceiling which was covered up with paper stuck to the roof, and once it rained the roof leaked and water was everywhere. Stayed over the new years eve period so it was pricey, but i'll rather pay an extra $50 a night than stay there again. You also need flipflops for the bathroom.", "Date": "Jan 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR840326200", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ivyangel"}, {"Content": "terrible experience:worst hotel I ever stayed in I recently booked a two night stay in the Victoria Park Inn on Broadway Street in Sydney. We discovered a week before the trip that we needed to change our booking which we did, giving much more than the 48 hr notice requested by the Inn itself on its own website. We emailed them to say that we would be a day late but would stay on an extra day instead. We received no reply to our email. On arrival we were told that the email had been received. However the following morning we were told that the email had not been received, that we were being charged for the night we had not stayed and that we would need to pay again if we were to stay for a following night. This was all conveyed to us by the receptionist shouting through our bedroom door which she opened herself while we were in bed. She insisted that she had not received the email so eventually, after a dispute with her, we left rather than paying again.In addition to this the accomodation was shockingly bad and definitely not three star rating. The room was shabby, the bedsheets had holes in them, the window did not open, the toilet freshener was jammed half-way down the cistern, the walls were paper thin and hoovering began in the halls before nine in the morning.All thing considered it was definitely the worst hotel I ever spent time in, shockingly bad and the incident in the morning was just the final straw.", "Date": "Aug 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR315110996", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LOR19"}, {"Content": "Not what it seems My wife and i stayed here for one night only, and quite frankly, that was enough. The car-park is a disgrace, capable of holding maybe 6-8 cars total you have to continually shuffle your car around to park or get out.From the car-park there is a LONG rusting winding steel staircase you have to climb up to get into the lobby. There is no lift in the hotel for guests, only a terribly old monstrosity used for stock deliveries.The room was comfortable enough, although a little smaller than we imagined, but clean. The surprise was that we were supplied with only ONE towel for the two of us! When my wife asked for another towel it was ripped all along one edge!!", "Date": "Mar 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR170363485", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d593968-r23296312-Victoria_Park_Inn_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "593968", "Price": "$73"}}
