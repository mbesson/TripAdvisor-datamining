Due to this, prices went up - but it was the best value and cheapest out of all the hotels during that peek period of time.

We had a room with a window and a 'non smoking' room. But when you walk in you can see an ashtray on the table. So much for 'non smoking' room. The room smelt funny upon walking in and we would have not put up with it if it had not been for the A/C that got rid of the smell. A/C was a bit noisy but didn't bother us too much and it did its job which is to make the room cold. The bed was good, allowed a good nights sleep. Bathroom was alright - staff supplied new towels and other bathroom amenities everyday as well as making up the bed. There is a 7/11 right next door which you can get snacks and drinks. MRT is about 10 mins walk not far at all! Taxi to the MRT is about $5SG. Didn't interact with the staff too much, but they reminded us that our check out time was approaching, and the fact they let me check in without a passport made them friendly.

We found a decent, cheap, comfortable hotel in Singapore!\u201d", "Author": "Subbi", "ReviewID": "UR32269191", "Content": "Date of Stay: 14 May - 17 May 2009 Who: 52 year old \"Mum\" and 29 year old \"Daughter\" Reason for Stay: 3 days sightseeing in Singapore following 3 weeks in Viet Nam. We wanted a cheap, clean hotel that didn't rent rooms by the hour. We wanted to be near to public transport. Singapore is horrendously expensive for accommodation compared to other Asian countries, we wanted a hotel for less than SGD$100 per night. Very few reviews of this hotel on Trip Advisor so we checked out 150 of the 300+ reviews on Asia Rooms before deciding to stay at the Gateway Hotel. Our Experience: Booked online via the Hotel's own website - by booking through their website, the room rate of SGD$128 per night was discounted to SGD$98 per night (Special Internet Rate). We had been looking at Hotel 81 Joo Chiat but this would have been SGD$30 more per night and while on the same road, further from public transport. We were required to complete and return a credit card authorisation (we scanned and emailed this) as the full price of the accommodation was charged on confirmation of booking. With the exchange rate at that time, for 3 nights accommodation we paid AUD$305.36 all up - room only, breakfast not available/included. We specifically requested, via email, that we be allocated a twin room with windows, and a non-smoking room. Research showed that some rooms in the hotel have no windows, and of course being in Asia smoking rooms are common. We arrived via Tiger Airways from Sai Gon (Ho Chi Minh City) just after 11:30am and took the Airport Shuttle at SGD$9 per head to the hotel, arriving a little before 1:30pm. The Shuttle drops you at the door of the hotel, though we now know given Joo Chiat and the Hotel's proximity to the airport we would have saved a few dollars by catching a taxi. Although we arrived prior to the designated check-in time we were able to check-in straight away. We were required to pay a refundable cash \"deposit\" of SGD$20 to cover potential incidentals (we already knew about this through our research). The lobby area was clean, and fairly spacious. There were a number of computers (coin operated) available for use by Hotel guests, and a few chairs for waiting in the lobby. Two lifts serviced the hotel - the lobby area and lifts are non-smoking due to laws passed in Singapore (there was signage in the lifts regarding the fines if caught smoking in the lobby/lifts). Given our swipe card key for our room, and pointed to the lift. Up to our room on the 4th floor. Wound our way down a couple of corridors to our room at the back of the hotel (probably about 40 - 50 paces from the lifts). Not only did we have a window - we had two! Each window in addition to curtains had shutters on the outside helping to keep out both light and sound. Clearly a non-smoking room. Our room was clean, neat, spacious, didn't smell. Two large single beds (wider than the 3 foot standard single bed here in Australia). Desk and chair, bench seat with drawers, tea & coffee making facilities, 2 complimentary bottles of water (we received another two each day of our stay), in room safe (inside the wardrobe). The television was bolted to the roof, making for extra space in an already large room. There was no fridge in the room (which we knew from the Hotel's website - there are fridges in the Theme Rooms however these come in Double format only) however there was an ice-bucket in the room and an ice machine 16 paces from our door. In addition there is a 7-11 store (open 24hours) immediately next door to the Hotel's entrance. Bathroom was small but clean overall. Our only complaint would be the mould on the shower curtain and tiles. While normally this doesn't concern us too much, unfortunately when the hot water hit the shower curtain you could smell the mould. That said, as we were only staying 3 nights we didn't worry about mentioning this to the Hotel, and are confident that if we had, they would have fixed it (a little bleach was all that was needed). The bathtub itself was clean - no mould. Toilet and vanity were pristine. We were provided with soap, two tooth brushes, and there was a dispenser on the wall presumably for shampoo/liquid soap but we had our own shampoo so didn't even look to see if it was full. The staff at the Hotel's desk generally took no notice of us as we came and left during our three days (which pleased us as we generally don't feel the need to share our day with reception), but some may find this distant/cold/unfriendly. When we did approach the desk (once to arrange late check out, once as our key had stopped working, and on check out) the staff were generally polite. There were usually two to three people on reception. When we left our room on the last day we had to navigate around the cleaning trolley - the ladies were lovely, moving so we could get past, and relatively friendly. We arranged to check out at 1pm instead of the standard 12pm at a cost of SGD$10 as our flight back to Perth did not leave until 3:50pm so we didn't need to be at the airport until 1:50pm. Wireless internet is available in the Hotel at a price. Having come from Viet Nam where generally internet was provided free of charge this was not an option we were interested in. The price was not overly cheap and you had to pay for a minimum of 2 hours without calculation based on actual usage (if you bought it at 1pm, it was gone by 3pm even if you only needed it for 10 minutes). The location: The Gateway Hotel is in Joo Chiat - the Malay quarter of Singapore, and is a 10 minute train ride from City Hall Interchange Station (to Paya Lebar MRT Station). The walk from the Gateway Hotel to the MRT Station would take roughly 10 minutes at a comfortable pace (unless of course you catch every red pedestrian light at the intersections). In addition to the train, public buses were readily available on Changi Road (we caught Bus 7 directly to the Botanic Gardens for just SGD$1.50 - double decker bus, trip took perhaps an hour through traffic). Much has been said about Joo Chiat and Geylang being in the red-light district of Singapore. We returned to our hotel after 8pm each night, and as late as 9:30+ and not once did we see any \"ladies of the night\". We did see lots of people out enjoying the fantastic Hawker food at one of the many Hawker centres near our hotel, including Mr Teh Tarik (very popular - great Murtabak available here), and Haig Road Hawker Centre to name but two. There were a number of small bars and Hawker centres/restaurants near our hotel however nothing to stop a sound night's sleep. At no time did we feel unsafe or frightened coming or going to/from our Hotel. In addition, there are some lovely sights nearby - beautifully restored shop houses, a few temples etc. Summary: When we next travel to Singapore we would definitely stay at the Gateway Hotel again. The price and location were perfect for our needs - particularly as Singapore has such a great public transport system which means there is no need to stay right in the \"city centre\". The room was clean and comfortable - the beds were very comfortable (not too hard or too soft, and we have experienced both extremes through Asia). The only downside was the mould on the bottom of the shower curtain (it was certainly not all over it) and that is an easy fix!", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cGood room, not enough teabags\u201d", "Author": "LeicesterTennisstar", "ReviewID": "UR14533697", "Content": "We spent 3 nights in one of the larger \"theme\" rooms at the Gateway in February.

It was fairly noisy outside at night as there is a nightclub just across the road and also a bar/cafe and both of these places are open into the early hours of the morning. However, considering the price and accommodation provided, we thought it was fairly reasonable. Although there are numerous eating places within walking distance, if you are looking for anything resembling an English breakfast this could be a problem. The closest we could find was a version of toast and eggs which consists of 2 slices of sweet bread buttered then toasted with the buttered sides together. The eggs were boiled and very underdone and then shelled and served in a bowl- the sight of them put me off eggs for a while. However, 2 of these breakfasts served with 2 cups of tea which is made with condensed milk will only cost you about \u00a33.50.
