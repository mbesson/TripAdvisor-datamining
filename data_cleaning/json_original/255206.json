I found the bus stop just a few yards from McDs very handy 3 buses stop almost outside the hotel. I can agree with most comments here, but as we normally only use hotels as a base I found it ok, my room was clean and comfortable, and breakfast sellection was more than adequate.

No hotel shuttle but it was easy to get to from the airport: we opted to jump on the Airport Express bus from Barajas and got off at the last stop - the Atocha Train station. Its about a 40 minute trip @ 3 euro per person, the bus even has free wi-fi. From the train station its about a 5-10 minute walk to the hotel. (If you plan to take the bus back to the airport, just make sure you can grab it again at the train station because it doesn't operate out of there during certain hours.) During your walk, as you get closer to hotel you might see a few \"interesting\" shops... but that just adds to the character, we encountered no problems whatsoever and there were people, families, etc. walking around everywhere. My husband even had his hair cut at one of the clean, friendly shops down the street and they did a great job. We had a room with a King bed with all your basic necessities. It was clean and modern and on the small side (no dresser) but we never spend much time in our room anyway. They have a nicely stocked fridge, flat screen TV, nice bathroom with a bidet. The few problems we encountered were taken care of right away: no working air conditioning, broken toilet seat. The safe was also out of order but we had no need for it. The staff were all very friendly and polite and eager to help. There was a security guard at all times in the lobby so safety was never an issue. He even locked our bags in a private room when we arrived early in the morning our first day (our room was not ready) so we didn't have to worry about our belongings while we explored the city, went for breakfast. The location is excellent! You have the Metro Station (Anton Martin stop) at your front door that will take you basically anywhere you want to go. The stations are clean and user friendly, ticket kiosks are set up for several languages and there are signs everywhere indicating station line numbers and stops, all color coordinated. We walked to Retiro Park and Museo del Prado just around the corner. We went to Plaza Mayor, Puerta del Sol and San Miguel Market, all about 15-20 minutes away, on foot...but you can easily get there on the Metro as well. We also hopped on the Madrid Tourist bus which has a stop right around the corner, on the main street next to McDonald\u2019s.

We booked the hotel through priceline, name your own price. We got a decent deal, so overall the value we got was reasonable. Having said that, there were a couple of things we disliked and a few that we liked. The location is quite central. It is close to all three museums (Prado, Thyssen and Reina Sofia), and walking distance from the Plaza Mayor, Puerta Del Sol, Gran Via, The royal Palace. The metro station is a short walk away. But, a central location applies to almost any hotel in the Sol area. The neighborhood, on the other hand, is not as nice as in the Gran Via. I was Ok with it, but it is much nicer to get out of the hotel in the morning to the view of the Metropolis building, than it is to the bustle of Calle De Atocha. The checkin process was rather slow. We got in at 11pm and there were several people in front of us. On a few occasions during our stay, we had to wait a long time for the receptionists. It seems that the desk is understaffed quite frequently. The hotel does not have wi-fi in the lobby (poor reception). Wi-fi gets stronger as you walk to the back end of the hotel, where the rooms are. If your room is around that area, you could get wi-fi in the room, although the reception may be choppy. In room 219, I had good reception but your mileage may vary. At this day and age, I would expect in-room wi-fi. My guess is that in higher floors, reception will be lousy. There is a wired connection in the room, which was OK but we had to get a cable from the front desk. My room was actually good. The best part was the bathroom, which was quite spacious and recently renovated. One issue is that there were a few exposed nails in the woodwork and I actually stepped on one in the middle of the night. Not fun and this should not happen. Towels were old and thin. My friends stayed in 121 on the first floor. They had a worse experience, with the street noise often becoming quite loud, especially on weekends. Try to avoid the first floor. Breakfast was decent but not worth it.

While it is nice to have a tv in the room to aid in sleeping (for me), I did NOT like the sole English channel.

It took 3 subway lines (about 3-4 stops each line) and an approxomate time of 45 mins.

Overall I would say that I would stay at this hotel again, if I could not find a better option. And I assume there are better options, as Madrid caters to a large tourism crowd.", "Date": "March 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cA very good hotel...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3183634", "Content": "I stayed at the Tryp Atocha on sevral ocassions during the month of January 2005. It was my Madrid base during my trip to Spain. Very centrally located. Metro just right in front. A great place to stay if you are taking the AVE Train (@5 blocks down the street). Rooms very clean and comfortable. Twice I stayed in room 606, very quiet and very well ventilated. One time I stayed on the third floor with a room facing the street (Atocha). The room had double pane windows and I couldn't hardly heard any noice outside. It was good too. The staff was wonderful, very accomodating and professional. I would stay there again.", "Date": "February 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "MusicFanDublin", "ReviewID": "UR2979531", "Content": "Got a great deal on the hotel website for \u20ac90 per night including breakfast for 2 which was excellent and served until 11am. Room was fairly small and basic but clean. Good location 15 minutes walk from the centre and 10 minutes from the museums. Metro station outside the door (only 50 cent from the airport with a few changes). Nearest Metro station is Anton Martin not Atocha as you might think (which is a walk up a steep hill). Area is safe enough but as previous reviews mentioned, hotel is directly opposite two strip bars and on the Sunday night we stayed there, there were a lot of banging doors throughout the night and there was a konock on our door at 3am. Overall though, don't let this put you off as it might have been a one-off and the hotel represented good value for money!", "Date": "January 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2787775", "Content": "We had a great stay at the Tryp Atocha. This was our 2nd stay at a Tryp hotel and we have enjoyed both. The hotel is new and the rooms had hardwood floors. The pillow selection feature was great! Location can't be beat with the underground stop just steps outside the hotel. Loads of restaurants, bars and sites close by. We were a bit nervous of the location based on the reviews we had previously read in Trip Advisor but as long as you aren't alone there is no issue. We also called the Somelia office and were able to get an even lower deal than the internet! I'd definitely stay again.", "Date": "October 26, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Tryp Atocha", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d255206-Reviews-Tryp_Atocha-Madrid.html", "Price": "$85 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Atocha 83</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28012</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "255206", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/67/77/677756777d7e685267e37da8ea116b9a7large.jpg"}}
