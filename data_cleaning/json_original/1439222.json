Furthermore, it's got to be good to be ranked 8th amongst all the hotels in Los Angeles, right? However, after a wonderful trip to Vegas at a cheaper-priced resort at a more convenient location, we were unsure how to make a true comparison. On the bright side of things:The location was good with Universal Studios a freeway away, the reservation service was prompt and no fuss, the free parking / free wifi / flat-screen HD TV with multiple channels rocked. Though small, the room came complete with all the facilities of a standard motel room. When you check in, Jerry gives you a small bag with snacks and drinks (all my favourites!). The water pressure and pillows were quite satisfactory. On the other hand: There isn't an elevator in the motel so if you bring heavy luggage, you'll have to get it up the stairs. The walls and floors feel flimsy as we could hear/feel our next door neighbours moving about their room. The motel is located near a hospital so we were awoken by sirens through the night. It is also located in between two taller buildings so the area feels hemmed in. The toilet is a little cramped and there isn't any light in the shower area so you either bathe in semi-darkness or wet the bathroom because you leave the shower curtain open to let the light in. There isn't a heater in the toilet as well, so if you shower too late, you can get quite cold during the winter months. The verdict: Considering the other hotels in the nearby vicinity were very much more expensive than Jerry's, I would say that Jerry's Motel is a good place to stay if 1) you're on a budget 2) only concerned if you have a place to sleep (and can sleep through loud noises). We saw the owner every morning about his chores and was always nice and polite but wasn't particularly very warm or friendly as the other reviewers mentioned. In the end, we're confused. We don't like giving bad reviews but we have to say, Jerry's Motel was an \"experience\" of a lifetime. Would we come back? Not likely. If you do decide to stay at Jerry's Motel, go in with an open mind and if you can survive the first night, it gets more bearable each night you stay.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southwest", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "RubyWanderlust", "ReviewID": "UR127155362", "Content": "We arrived in LA late at night and we were checked in immediately, with a bag of goodies which we really appreciated as hungry travelers.

Luckily, Jerry had a cancellation, and called me to tell me a room would be available not long before my trip. So, I cancelled my replacement booking, and made a reservation with Jerry. I'm glad I did! Everything the other reviewers say is true: My room was clean, charmingly-appointed and very comfortable. I particularly liked the seafoam-green bathroom tile, and the spacious walk-in closet. The TV had LOADS of channels, the Wi-Fi was free and worked well, and there was even a refrigerator and microwave. The room was so nice, I had friends who were also attending the Expo express frustration that their hotel was not only more expensive and farther away, but also not as well-appointed with amenities! As many others have also pointed out, Jerry is an incredibly nice man who is very knowledgeable about the area. He was able to let me know what buses I needed to take to get anywhere I needed to go as quickly and as cheaply as possible. In fact, he told me about a 35\u00c2\u00a2 shuttle to the Convention Center that stopped just two blocks away, and that dropped me off at the front door to the Expo in about 10 minutes! Add to this the fact that I was only a 10-minute walk from downtown. Really great location. I can't recommend Jerry's Motel highly enough to my fellow travelers.

We were able to get a room without having to leave a credit card number for a reservation, for $65 with no extra fees for taxes or having 2 adults, and they greeted us at the door when we arrived around 1130pm. They allowed us to extend our check-out time to 1230 instead of 11 the next morning when I explained that we were looking for apartments and needed to use the free Wifi for a little longer. Not only was she okay with us checking-out late with no extra fee, but also wrote down the numbers of several good apartment complexes in the area that were within our price range, as well as offering for us to stay for the whole week at a very discounted and generous price. This is a family run hotel, and they were a very nice family that did what they could to make our stay comfortable and pleasant, and I would recommend it to anyone. This place was far better than the 3 Motel 6s that we stayed in on our drive which were the same price.. but had extra fees for wifi, a second adult, a weekend reservation, late check-out, and requesting a non-smoking room, all accompanied with rude employees....", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recomended!!\u201d", "Author": "teckwei86", "ReviewID": "UR76768799", "Content": "Hi!

Swayed by the positive reviews of Jerry's Motel here, I booked a room. Important note: Jerry (yes, there is a Jerry) does not ask for credit card information prior to arrival. Unconventional and while a little unnerving for some business travelers (who connect giving a CC# with locking in a reservation), it is, on the other hand, a fair gesture and one that conveys trust. Rest of story: Through a business contact I secure lodging closer to my business event (E3 at the LACC, the largest convention in Los Angeles), at no cost to me, so of course I choose to stay at that hotel. However, I forget to inform Jerry that I no longer need the previously reserved room at his motel. Fast forward to the first day of the event -- the day after I was to have checked in at Jerry's. I get a call on my cell phone and it is Jerry, who in the friendliest and an almost gentle manner, asks if I intend to stay at the hotel. I am shocked at my own forgetfulness. I feel terrible. I apologize to Jerry. I offer to make good on the reservation. Repeat apologies. Jerry will have none of it. He understands. He asks if I made it to Los Angeles safely. How my accommodations are. He says there is no need to send any money but to come by the motel to have a look and to please consider his operation on my next trip. Bottom line: Jerry is clearly a fair, honest, stand-up guy. I flaked on him and he never made me feel like the idiot I was. I certainly cost Jerry a couple hundred dollars in lost revenue during the biggest business week in Los Angeles. My hats off to you, sir. May the good reviews for Jerry's Motel continue -- you very likely deserve them. And I will definitely consider your motel on my next trip to LA.

On top of that, the room was clean and comfortable, and the owner was friendly providing good service. Remember that to a certain extent you get what you pay for, so don't expect luxury. Also don't expect it to feel like a budget chain hotel such as Super 8 or Knight's Inn. This is less... shall we say \"updated\" than those chain motels tend to be. It feels instead like a really great $15 room you'd find while backpacking through Latin America. And once you shift your paradigm in this way you can appreciate how nice the room really is. It's small and the old building feels outdated and a bit drab. But it's clean and comfortable with personable details. The parking and rooms are open to the outside (not gated) and some prior reviewers described the neighborhood as sketchy. The motel is very close to downtown (I walked in 5 minutes to the Marriott) but located in a rapidly-changing neighborhood that is mixed-income quickly turning toward low-income depending on which direction you walk. I felt 100% comfortable and safe staying here for two nights alone, as a White woman in my 30s, and visibly pregnant at the time. One night I walked home from dinner downtown alone after dark, at about 8pm. The next night I drove home around midnight and parked in the motel lot. Never did I feel unsafe or uncomfortable during my stay here. And even as a pregnant woman, I slept like a baby in the bed. There is no bathtub, just a standup shower. But it's clean with plenty of hot water and water pressure. The owner even gives you a Pert-Plus shampoo and body lotion when you check in.
