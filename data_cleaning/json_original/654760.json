{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nightclub Nightmare The location of this hotel is quite good, just off Alexanderplatz, but that is about the only plus about it. We stayed on a Thursday and Friday, the first night was ok the rooms are clean but basic with no hairdryer or glasses in the bathroom. Friday night however was a disaster. The nightclub directly across the street had us awake until 5am, and we had to be up at 7am!!!This hotel certainly at weekends, cannot provide you with the most basic facility of all, namely a decent nights sleep.", "Date": "Feb 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR908131462", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "skidub"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d654760-r13638631-Hotel_Arena_am_Alexanderplatz-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "654760", "Price": "$107"}}
