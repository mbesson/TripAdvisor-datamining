The place is modern at least has a big elevator than most European hotel I've been to. The breakfast in the morning has good choices than the most average hotel. The room Needs some soundproofing cause I can hear the door slam as someone gets in and out of an adjacent room. The hand railing in the toilet was about to come off but the toilet is clean with good smelling towels with an efficient water heating system.

We made our way by train and Metro from the airport and did not have a problem finding it. Location was great for us and despite buying a T10 travel ticket at the airport we spent the whole week walking. The hotel is close to the Arc de Triomf metro station but far enough away from La Ramblas to get a good night's sleep. A review I read suggested making sure you got an outside facing room, they were right. It wasn't too hot while we were there so I kept the window shut, but when I did open it you could hear the conversations of everyone in rooms facing the enclosed mini plaza. I can imagine that being awful in a busy summer week. We didn't opt for breakfast in house and was glad as there are so many cafes and an indoor market just round the corner to choose from with better value for money. I always take my travel kettle away for morning tea & coffee. The fridge in the room was a great touch along with a fresh stock of free bottled water every day, excellent! Staff spoke perfect English and were very polite and helpful. The pool wasn't open as it was too early in the season but you could still sit on the roof terrace. The gym was small but perfectly adequate, although we didn't use it as we walked so much we only used the hotel to wash and sleep. The bathroom could have done with a a bit of sprucing up if you're bothered about aesthetics but everything functioned properly and the shower was hot with very good pressure.

Major gripes were that there was nothing warm available apart from toast and the selection was a little lacking. However, it did turn out to be free despite booking via Hotwire which was a pleasant surprise and it would have been nice if we were informed of this before. The room was adequate. Clean, simple decor and the complimentary water bottles came in use. View to the back of the building was disappointing but then again the view out of the front wouldn't have been much better. The area that the hotel is located within is not exactly central but it is an easy enough walk to the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (Barcelona Basilica) in order to pick up tourist buses or walk down to the beach.

It is a 30 to 35 euro cab ride from the airport (if you've packed light, I recommend walking to Plaza Catalunya where there are shuttles to the airport for a fraction of the cab cost I paid - we packed heavy so it would be quite a walk). The rooms were spacious, the wifi was a bit weak but we managed, the rooms were clean and well maintained, and the hotel staff were very helpful and spoke good english.

When I saw the location and price deal I recieved ($1 less total for the two night booking! And the price dropped $20 and Hotwire refused to give me the price match guarantee) , I was Not happy at all with this hotel. After researching and reading up, I settled down and realized the hotel could work well for the trip. LOCATION: 3.5 When arriving, the hotel is in a descent area, but not touristy. It was very easy to get to and from the Arc de Triumf metro station. I enjoy walking the cities I visit, and to get to Las Ramblas or Barceloneta beaches, it is a good 15-20 minute walk. The Arc de Triumf and The Parc situated directly south of it were extremely populated and busy on Saturday afternoon. Made for a good stroll to watch rollerbladers, capoeira dancers, etc. I was hoping to be in a different location, but overall the location was not bad at all. TIP- Bracafe is right around the corner from the hotel. Great food and service, very cheap price. Ate breakfast there twice and had lunch one day. HOTEL- 4 The hotel is very modern and minimalistic. There is a nice bar area for breakfast (didn't use personally) and a few couches to relax. The rooms had a nice decor, but nothing useless inside. The bathroom was a descent size, with very cool anti-fog mirrors. The bed was comfortable and had a few extra pillows in the closets. And the free water, which I made fun of before getting to the hotel, turned out to be great for the day walks. The only problem with our room was that the heater/ac did not work at all. It made the room tough to sleep in both nights. Service- 3 It started off average since I emailed the hotel asking for the easiest directions to the hotel from the airport. Their website gives a driving route, but not specific buses, metros, etc. (46 bus to Playa espanya, then L1 to Arc de Triumf). The hotel never emailed back. The staff spoke fluent english, and it was easy to check-in/out. They gave us the choice of smoking or non-smoking rooms. They always greeted us when we entered the hotel. The only gripe was the AC problem. After the first night, I spoke to the front desk attendant and explained that the AC source was not working at all. It did not turn on/off and that we would be out all day if someone could look at it and fix it for us. When we returned that evening, there was no mention of the results. No note or message to explain to us, and no offer to change rooms. As it was already very late, we decided to not to bother with changing rooms. Overall- 3.5 As I said, I did not personally choose this hotel. But I was happy with the results of our stay. It was a good value $100 a night USD. I would recommend this hotel for people wanting to stay away from the full on tourist mayhem of Las Ramblas area, and for those trying to save a bit. I would stay again if the value was right even though I prefer the Poble-sec area much better.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cConfortel Auditori\u201d", "Author": "Themaadone", "ReviewID": "UR124754070", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel in February 2012 for 3 nights. The hotel is unassuming from the outside with good local amenities. There is a good, modern, clean and friendly cerveseria opposite the hotel, some fast food eateries nearby, several supermarkets and a Metro station 8 Minutes walk away near the Arc de Tromfe. The entrance/ foyer to the hotel is clean and friendly, your eye gets taken to the reception and is easy to spot with attentive staff who checked us in with no problems. At the same time they gave us a small map of Barcelona and the WIFI code which comes in handy and cuts roaming costs. There are 2 lifts next to the reception which are also clean and usually quick to come after being requested. Downstairs from the reception are the management offices, the small Gym and toilets. It smelt a little of toilet/sewage there but the cleaners were alsways about cleaning! Beware the toilet lights run on motion timers - if you like meditating and taking your time over a leisurly number 2 the light will pop off and plunge you into perpetual darkness.... The room we had allocated was very good. Clean walls, floors and bedding. A decent, firm bed, fair sized bathroom, flatscreen TV and good lights. Ample space to hang clothes, a mini fridge with 4 free bottles of water which was restocked when room was cleaned. The safe is also free of charge unlike some hotels. The bathroom had a walk in shower and was powerful and hot (a little too hot at first but then that's my fault for turning it to full without checking). We did have to ask for a repair to the shower unit due to the holder being cracked meaning you had to hold the shower to have a shower. It was fixed within 12 hours of mentioning this to the reception staff. The room was very good in my opinion even though our view was the inner courtyard with little natural light but we went to see Barcelona and not the courtyard! We did not have breakfast at the hotel - at between 9-13 euros it was far more expensive than outside the hotel and we did not try the hotel bar either. At check out the hotel ordered a taxi which arrived promptly and they looked after our bags so we could enjoy our last day. Top marks for service! A special note of thanks to the reception staff.

We didn\u2019t rely on the staff too much, as we did much research for this trip before we arrived. However the staff did help us when we needed them, we booked our tickets for the FC Barcelona match through the hotel and also arranged a taxi for us at 5.30 a.m. when we were checking out. You can also purchase tickets for excursions there and book tickets for the sight seeing bus (there are actually 2different city sight seeing tours - we didn\u2019t use the company that the hotel advertises). The use of free internet was also great as we were able to check things out for ourselves! We didn\u2019t eat at the restaurant but in the mornings we went across the street to get coffee from the bar and next door to the bar was a bakery. We would then bring our coffee and pastries back to the room and eat before we left for the day. The only problem we incurred while we were staying there was that the electricity was out one morning.

The double bed was 2 single beds put together, but this isn\u2019t very uncommon in European hotels. And the A/C was a plus as we found the weather very humid for the end of October.

Upon entering the room, it looked very contemporary with a view of the street. Although the room is seemingly clean, I couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy as to the hotel's cleaning standard; I'm refering to the washroom specifically, the glass door was moldy at the base, mold which could have been easily removed had the cleaning person used some bleach, my sheets were probably changed daily but I had doubts... I had the chance to try one breakfast, the selection comprised of hams, cheeses, fruits, juices, rice cakes, eggs ( I had mine fried). bread, croissant. but I thought it to be on the pricy side. The area surounding the hotel isn't the best, Arc de triumf subway is a 5-10 minutes walk depending on your pace.

Another incident again involving her was I was ignored while at the front desk, and she DARED attending to a guest that came after me, I didn't say anything about the incident but spoke harshly to her, and she was so embarassed she couldn't even look at me straight in the eye (especially since she knew what had happened and didn't apologize). Two the cleaning lady at my floor a young spanish girl gave me a lot of dirty looks which made me wonder even more about how well she cleaned my room. I was appalled by those attitudes, and think it might have been racially motivated. Besides those incidents, I must emphasize the remainder of the staff was polite and friendly.

Go to the very far left end of T2 and get the train. There are no signs till you get close. Buy a T10 ticket from the machine.

It's more changes than going to Tetuan, but at least when you get out you aren't at a cross roads where every direction looks the same.

I had read many of the reviews before booking it, so I had an expectation of the hotel which proved to be about right. I would say that we got a fantastic deal via expedia so we were very pleased with what we got. Some comments: 1. Location A bit out of the centre of the city (centre is Place de Catalunya, right near the main street of La Ramba). It's a 20 minute walk which doesn't feel safe at night time so I wouldn't recommend it. It's a 5 minute walk to the Arc de Triomf metro stop, and everything is really easy to access from the metro. To get to the hotel from Barcelona Aiport, when we arrived at Terminal 1 we took the free shuttle to Terminal 2, where the trains leave from. We bought a T-10 ticket for 8 euro (allows 10 trips on the Barcelona Public Transport system), and took the train to Barcelona Sants station (it was about three stops). Once there, you need to go to Platform 8 to take the metro to Arc de Triomf station. Once you get out of the metro station (a lot of stairs with luggage!), you\u00b4ll see the Barcelona Nord station. You should cross the road and then walk along the Barcelona Nord station to get to the hotel (you need to ask someone or look at a map - it\u00b4s hard to explain). It took about an hour to get to the hotel, but was definitely far cheaper than taking a taxi. On the way back to the airport, we caught a taxi from the hotel to Place de Catalunya for 6 euro, then took the \u00b4Aerobus\u00b4 straight to the airport for 5 euro per person. This was definitely a faster and more pleasant option with luggage! It does work out more expensive though if you are on a tight budget - the first option costs 80 euro cents if you get the T-10 card! 2. Rooms Our room was comfortable and clean. The only thing I would say is that the bedside lights are extremely irritating because you can only have them both on together or not at all! Wasn't good if one person wanted to read later than the other. Air conditioning in the room which is very effective. The curtains need to be replaced as they didn't quite close together properly, but didn't mean people could see in. 3. Breakfast We really enjoyed the breakfast provided each morning. For one thing, it had a good timeslot of 7am til 10:30am. So many hotels only provide an hour window which might not suit. We also enjoyed the variety in the breakfast - being from Australia we are used to fruit and cereal at breakfast, which was provided, as well as the more traditional European breakfast of meat and cheeses with breads. 4. Pool The pool is tiny (think about 4 m by 4m!) but it was lovely to have a swim after a big day of sight seeing. The hotel really really needs to get some more loungers though! There are only six up there (the pool is on the roof) so people kept coming up then leaving as there was no where to sit and relax. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay in the Confortel Auditori. It was great value for money. The hotel also provides bottles of drinking water in the fridge for free which we really appreciated.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cNot what we expected\u201d", "Author": "Linea2", "ReviewID": "UR69725036", "Content": "... after reading all the fine reviews we expected more.

The front desk staff were not always busy as stated in some other reviews and we found them very friendly and helpful. We do have two suggestions for Confortel Auditori though: 1. Not enough light in the room, especially above the bed 2. The wireless internet was really weak. We had to use the public computers in the lobby most of the time.

When asked to transfer to the manager, the receptionist simply told me to call back on Monday, by when my reservation would be over. I was completely unimpressed by the inflexibility and lame reasons given for the rejection when I was simply asking to give my room away to someone who was already staying at the hotel (sharing rooms with other colleagues) and that such a big group of us made reservations there (bringing them all this business!).

Overall I was very satisifed with the hotel, and based on other reviews was what I expected. Access to the Metro was very good -- turn left out of the hotel, take your first right on a walking street, Carrer de Ribes, and in 3 short blocks you're at the Arc de Triumf station (but note that there is both a train stop AND a metro stop there, so if you want the Metro, follow signs for M). As far as the hotel, I was surprised that they have no irons available whatsoever. Another reviewer reported irons, but no boards, but apparently now it's just no irons. Fortunately the water pressure and heat is fantastic, so I hung up my shirts and cranked some hot water to steam the wrinkles out, which worked great. Another surprise was that there was no alarm clock (or any clock) in the room. And for the life of me I could not call the reception desk - when I dialed '0' it just rang through, and trying '9' etc. didn't work, so it was a walk down to the desk to ask for one. All wake up calls were right on time, as was the taxi I ordered at 4am (ugh) for my 6am flight home. Finally, I agree with the other reports that the room was very warm. It was pretty cool there - our highs this week were ~50 degrees F, so it was easy enough to open the large window, but during warmer days I could see that could be an issue. The staff was quite friendly, and for a basic hotel in a convenient location to metro/bus, it was a fine place to be.

They've redone everything and the furniture and rooms have modern polish. When you dig a bit deeper it's a bit worse off.

On the positive side, it's the most eco-friendly and handicapped friendly hotel I've ever stayed at (more below). We ended up switching through 3 rooms in our 1 week stay. The first night they didn't save us a regular room though we'd paid for the week on Orbitz. We ended up in a handicap room which meant that it had different hangers, phones, shower, sink, toilet, etc. There was no toilet paper and I had to go down to the front-desk to get some. We then switched the next day into another room and though the hotel is no-smoking, some jerk had smoked a country worth of Marlboros. The room stank and they didnt' have any to switch us into (it was Mobile World Congress - 50,000 mobile phone execs come from around the world - if you're not traveling for the show, don't come that week). Our clothes smelled and we moved again as soon as we could (3 days later). The final room we are in is nice, but has a broken faucet and the curtains don't close entirely (just like the first two). I don't want to make this place sound too bad, because it does the trick. It's just far from everything except the metro (Arc de Triomph) which means you can't just walk out of your hotel and go a couple blocks to great restaurants or museums; it had its share of issues, which may have been unique to us; and is still nice enough that if you were traveling on business, wanted to save money instead of Le Meridien or W, it would do the trick.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, W Yorks", "Title": "\u201cFantastic value, and handy if you're flying in/out of Girona\u201d", "Author": "Pelle123", "ReviewID": "UR52919505", "Content": "As per all the other reviews, although it doesn't feel enormously personal, it perfectly meets the needs for a short city break.

The associated reviews from Tripadvisor gave this hotel an excellent 4.5 out of 5 so we took the plunge. The hotel is situated a little way from the main attractions, but let's put this into perspective; Plaza Catalunya/la Rambla is 2 metro stops or less than 15 minutes walk. Arc de triomph metro is literally 5 minutes walk away. Sagrada Familia is about 20 minutes walk. You can tell, we walked mostly. You could get the metro, it is quick and cheap. So location was fine for us. The Nord bus station is also very close (5 mins) if you want to use the bus services. The first impressions are good. It is small-ish and friendly, clean and contemporary with very helpful staff. Check-in was quick and easy and we got a 6th floor outside room. The rooms are also small-ish but not at all cramped. Everything you need is there. The in-room safe was useful so we didn't need to carry every valuable with us. The double bed was comfy, if a little firm for my tastes (but my partner thought it just fine). The bathroom has plenty of space and a great shower over the bath - it is nice to have the choice. There were a few small drawbacks which may be useful to other visitiors but none that caused us any qualms. Really it feels like nit-picking; * the hallways and rooms can be a bit warm (in December!) - but the rooms have air conditioning/heating. * if you leave the windows open, then expect some racket throught the night as the bins get emptied, cars and buses go past and the city just does its thing. * breakfast buffet is a little expensive, at 13 euros, but there are plenty of small bars/cafes within a block that do coffee and a croissant for 2-3 euros. Depends what you want. * the hotel does not offer evening meals (apart from a tie up with the local pizza delivery firm) so you'll need to go out - which is not a problem in Barcelona. You can halve the cost of the pizzas if you walk to the delivery office yourself - about 2 blocks. * no english language channels on the TV - another good reason to go out and enjoy the city! At the end of our stay we checked out at 12:00 noon and the hotel was happy to keep hold of our cases until we were ready to go to the airport. Getting to the hotel from the airport depends on who you fly with. If you fly into T1 then get the airport bus just outside to Plaza Catalunya (5 euros single) and then metro or walk or cab to the hotel. From T2 you have a choice of bus or train, the train goes from T2 - every 30 minutes. T1 and T2 are opposite sides of the airport and the link bus takes 10-15 minutes to get from T1 to the station/T2. Going back, and being much wiser, you have a choice. Reverse the metro/bus route or try the train. The train is really cheap if you have the time. From Arc de triomph metro to the airport cost us about 80 cents each! We got the hotel at a great rate which added to our overall satisfaction with our stay; less than \u00a345/night for the two of us. Would we go back again?

It's a 3 star hotel, and for that rating it fares pretty well. My mother always told me when travelling in mainland Europe, remove one star from the star rating to equate it to what is expected in the UK and North America, and this advice has always worked. Confortel Auditori is relatively near a metro station, about 2 blocks away. There are two supermarkets, a bakery and a pharmacy all in a one-block radius. The pharmacy was of particular importance to us as my spouse developed a particularly nasty case of gastric flu after eating at a restaurant in Las Ramblas (that's a story for a whole other review). Having a pharmacy so close was a godsend. The hotel staff were very sympathetic and as helpful as they could be during the time he was ill, sending up bottles of water and providing me with the cutlery and crockery I wanted in the middle of the night when the time finally came right to eat again. The bathroom is very clean. The sheets were of course clean but I didn't feel completely at ease in the bed - perhaps the discovery of a hair not belonging to myself or my partner was enough to throw me off that first night. The knowledge the hotel staff have about Barcelona is good, not amazing but not terrible. Restaurant recommendations were the hardest thing to get out of them. The hotel boasts free wireless, although with a Mac I found the first night I couldn't connect to their system, so I had to use one of the 2 computers in the lobby instead. The rest of the time it was no problem to connect. Overall it was an alright hotel, but I don't particularly feel any loyalty to stay there again.

Although we spent most of our time in the centre, it was nice to be able to get away from all the craziness to the area of our hotel - which was a quiet, pleasant, pretty neighbourhood. Our room was very quiet and clean. It was a bit smaller than I'd hoped - we'd booked a twin room but the beds were very close together - this was easily sorted by pulling one of the beds across the room a bit. Bathroom was also clean and had a fab shower - really powerful. The only gripe about the room was the temperature - it was far too hot. Neither of us slept as well as we would have liked - even with the air conditioning on the room didn't cool down all that much. I was glad it was November - I can't imagine what it would have been like in Summer! After a bit of investigation, it seemed like one of the main central heaters was on our floor - and next to our room (301) which probably explained it. We had a room on the inside, with the window opening on to the central air shaft - this meant it was a bit gloomy but very, very, very quiet which was ideal for us. Other reviews have complained about the price of breakfast - we thought it was great but we booked through hotels.com so paid around \u00a33 extra a night for breakfast to be included - a definite bargain for what was on offer ie a buffet including tortilla, bread, cheese, meats, fruit, yohurt, cereal, juice, tea and coffee. Nothing wrong with that! It was out of season for the swimming pool and spa facilities so I can't comment on those - we did check them out though and they seemed nice enough. The room did lack some of the extras you might expect to find eg sewing kit but it had everything we needed.

The hotel looks like the hotel that Ikea built. It is clean, modern and very comfortable. The first time I was there I was a single lady traveler, the last time I was with 16 friends. The hotel should be a 20-30 Euro taxi from the airport, two couples traveling with us got stuck in traffic and their taxi fee was triple. The hotel will arrange a car service for a set fee or the train from the airport comes to city center and then a short taxi to the hotel. We arrived very early from the US and some rooms were ready for check-in, others had to wait until the afternoon. The front desk was very kind and stored the luggage for the guests who did not have rooms. Theguests that needed handicapped accommodations were all given rooms on arrival. We appreciated their being so considerate of the grandmothers in our party. The location is city center. It is a fifteen-minute walk in each direction to major sightseeing. We walked to the hop-on hop-off trolley tour; we walked to the harbor, the cathedral\u2026everywhere. It felt safe and was very convenient. The hotel offers rates with or without breakfast. The breakfast at the hotel is very good if you eat a big breakfast. I wasn\u2019t hungry one day and the maitre\u2019d offered me just juice, at no cost. We went across the street to a great little Tapas bar for hor\u2019s deouvres and drinks and it was so much food it became dinner. The hotel offers free internet in the lobby. The rooms have nice flat screen televisions on the wall. The beds felt hard but everyone commented about how well they slept. The bathrooms are very nice, a little on the small side. The bathrooms have a very high step up into the tub. Not a problem in the handicapped accommodations. I would comment on the postings that rail on the hotel staff. I found them to be cordial, accommodating and professional. Absolutely NO problems with the staff. Both times I stayed in Barcelona was before a cruise.

We seen this guy Danil at reception the day we were leaving and I told him I was reporting him in writing which I did before leaving. Is this a SCAM? Ive never heared of anything like this before.

The hotel is in a residential area (close to Arc De Triomf metro) a couple of metro stops, or a 20 minute walk from the top of Catalunya Place (going West) or Sagrada Familia (going North). The staff on the service desk were very friendly and helpful (eg no trouble getting extra pillows, or leaving our cases on the last day). The rooms are modern, stylish, clean and comfortable. We liked it because it was peaceful after the bustle of sight-seeing - and you will get a good night's sleep. However, you won't get stunning views or lively bars on your doorstep. The rooms have TV (BBC & CNN World News in English), air con, safe, hair-dryer and a small fridge. This was stocked with bottled water (but we didn't get juice or alcohol-free beer as mentioned by others). The hotel has a gym (seems little used - though was pretty good), a very small pool on the roof (more for a cool-down dip than a swim) and free internet access from two PCs in the foyer (which were busy most of the time). We didn't take breakfast as we were room only and at 14 euros each would have worked out to be quite expensive. I would suggest a tea/coffee vending maching would be a useful addition as there is none available after breakfast. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because we could get a triple room (cheaper than paying for two rooms) as we have one teenager. On arrival we were offered an additional room for the same price - very happy with that. Very close to the hotel you will find a selection of small supermarkets and greengrocers. Also a nice bakery and a number of bars/coffee shops. We also had a very enjoyable meal at the pizza restaurant over the road (not just pizzas). So you can get just about anything you will need close by. Other tips include: We made good use of the Metro and bought the T10 travel card (10 trips for E7.70. Multi-person and transferrable. Used on metro/bus/tram). Access to plenty of cash (or from cashpoints). We found credit cards were not widely accepted, eg by the tour bus and entrance fees to several attractions. We were nearly pick-pocketed whilst out one day (but didn't feel personally threatened) - take sensible precautions. An early bus tour can help you get your bearings quickly. We got a good \"map by map\" guide from the Tourist Info office at Catalunya Place. We particularly enjoyed the cable car to the castle at Montjuic for great views. Get the Funicular from Paral Lel metro, then the Telerferic cable car. Also Gaudi's Park Guell and Sagrada Familia, a wander round the Gothic quarter, and Barceloneta beach.

We called the Front Desk a couple of times and they were always prompt in attending to our requests. We used the 2 computers in the lobby which was very convenient for our internet searches.

Best rates we got for this hotel was thru their website (hotelauditori.com). They offer an advance booking discount and rates were very reasonable. Hotel location was great, though we did a lot of walking. Arc de Triomph Metro L1 stop is the station closest to the hotel it was about a 5 minute walk. Per the advise of some reviews, the most inexpensive way to get to the hotel from the El Prat airport was via the Renfre #10 (Estacion Sants) and Metro (Red Line Arc de Triomphe). We purchased the T10 for 7.20 Euros and we were charged 1 Metro ride per person. It was easy, but there are a lot of stairs to handle, so this may not be advisable to travelers with heavy and/or plenty of luggage. We decided to take the Aerobus back which was 4.05 Euros per person. The bus is located at Placa Catalu\u00f1a right by El Corte Ingles. This is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, instead, bought a variety of breads from the bakery across the street. With cheese purchase from the Mercat de Boqueria and the fresh, delicious baked bread \u2013 we were all set for the mornings. We tried a few tapas bars as suggested in different books and websites \u2013 our favorites are: Pinotxo at the Mercat de Boqueria, Cerveceria Catalana (Address: C/ Malloca, 236), Euskal Etxea (Placeta Montcada, 1-3 near the Picasso Museum ).

Note that we were on the 6th floor (highest apart from the roof) and all the surrounding buildings are the same height, so no views. The Amenities: Breakfast (included in our Rate) was decent, although given the hotel wasn\u2019t too busy when we were there, the seating was rather limited and tended to fill up by about 8:30 / 9am each morning. The food selection was good however and was replenished through the service period. The staff in the hotel were pleasant, in particular the front desk were very helpful in assisting us with restaurant reservations and similar. There are also two free PC\u2019s in the lobby, and free wireless access in the rooms. On the downside however \u2013 there were a few times when the Confortel showed its budget hotel roots \u2013 requests for tissues, umbrellas (on the first day at least) and power adapters were not met. Lastly there\u2019s a small pool (**small** - a splash pool) on the roof, but we were there in late October and it was too cold to use. The Location: Probably the only (real) minor downside to the Confortel Auditori is its location \u2013 it is a bit of a way away from La Rambla (25 minute brisk walk) and the port areas (20 \u2013 30 minutes). We don\u2019t mind as we like walking \u2013 but older visitors or families with kids may not be so keen.

However, there is a Metro station 5 minutes away, and a further two stations (different lines) within 10 minutes. The tramline is also 10 minutes walk. A major bus depot is next door. The nearest Metro station (Arc de Triomf) is also an FGC & RENFE (railway line) station. So transport links are good. The Metro system is very efficient \u2013 though there\u2019s lots (and lots) of steps. Overall: For the competitive rates we paid for our booking (it was low season) we really haven\u2019t got any complaints about the Confortel. When we return to Barcelona (what a great city!) I would strongly imagine we will stay here again! General recommendations: We would recommend walking \u2013 the Historic / Old town is actually quite small, and is interesting to walk around. Restaurants \u2013 We were lucky to have a local friend recommend some places. Elx in the Maremagnum. Agua in Port Olimpica. Merendero de la Mari in Port Vell. All 3 were really excellent up market restaurants.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, USA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, great location, modern design\u201d", "Author": "thedreamgl", "ReviewID": "UR21685873", "Content": "We loved the hotel .Stayed there for 3 nights at the end of December 2007.

The main appeal of the hotel was that it looked very bright and clean, appeared to be in a decent enough location and was quite inexpensive. The hotel is about a 30 minute \"RENFE\" ride and 15 minute Metro from the airport. The room itself was actually pretty nice. It was how we expected it- fairly small but big enough. It had a tv on the wall with a variety of channels and a desk/table in the main room, as well as a safe in the cupboard. There was an air conditioner in the room but it didn't really make the room that cool, however, it was adequate. The bed was suprisingly comfortable and quite large. There is also a free minbar in the room with water, sparkling water, coke, juice and beer. In the bathroom there was a hairdryer which is useful, obviously. The bathroom was really clean and stylish, with a large bath. There was a window/door looking out onto the road and it let a lot of light in making the room bright. If you can, request a room at the front because I have read that people with rooms at the back have complained that the room was quite dark. The rooms were cleaned and tidied daily and even if you wake up late you can request that your room is cleaned when you are out. The hotel has a small swimming pool, probably 5 metres long. WARNING: DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL LOOKING FOR A LAZY POOL HOLIDAY BECAUSE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED! However, the roof area is quite nice, and has a few sun loungers you can catch some rays on during the day, although these got pretty busy. There is also a fitness room in the basement that is really nice. We didn't even go there until the last day but had i know I would have used it. It is small, but was empty when I went and I don't think it gets too busy. There was also a fridge full of free water in there and air conditioning. The hotel is about a 2 minute walk from the metro station and just around the corner from numerous supermarkets. I have read that it is a short walk from \"La Rambla\" which is the main road in Barcelona. However, it is quite a walk, but certainly walkable in about 20-30 minutes. But to be honest the metro is really good with air conditioning and you can get to pretty much anywhere in the city quite easily (get a T-10 if you plan on using the metro lots, you get 10 metro trips for about 7\u20ac and you can share it). We found that the area called \"El Born\" was the best area. It had lots of excellent restaurants, bars and shops, with a lovely square with a cathedral (Santa Maria del Mar) and it was a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. So, the only negatives were that the staff weren't particularly friendly, but they were efficient and did their job well. Also, the hotel is part of a chain and it did feel like this. You felt a little bit like a number, but this doesn't really matter, as it is only a hotel. I have read reviews where people were disappointed with the Confortel Auditori because they chose it as 'luxury' accomodation. We were very happy with it because we considered it as a 'cheaper' option, so I wouldn't go here if luxury is what you are looking for. Finally, as mentioned before I didn't find the air conditioning cool enough and the sun loungers got very busy. Overall, we were very happy with our stay at Confortel Auditori.

As many people have indicated in the past the hotel is within a residential area so is off the beaten track rather than the centre, and to be honest I don't think that was a bad thing. We arrived on the mid afternoon into Barcelona City Airport and caught the train into Barcelona Train Station and the connecting journey to the Arc de Triomph, due to my inability to remember the map we had to wing it when we arrived in the area and after some scratching heads we go there. If you do have the same problem this MAY help. If you exit and you are facing the Arc de Triomph building then follow the road round to the left and head towards the bus station which you should see. Once at the bus station there is are a number of entrances to the bus stop but if you have a look for the restaraunt Otobre (or very similar) the hotel is on your right (apologises if there is an easier way to go, but is is where the locals directed us to!), the other exits are actually out at the bus terminal. The hotel was described as many other, free mini bar with water, juice and non-alcoholic lager, a digital safe and air con. The bathroom was equipped with a shower and hairdryer. I do agree that the rooms do not have the best natural light and our room looked into some sort of void into the centre of the hotel so no natural air coming into the room, but as it was only somewhere to rest our heads this is a very minor detail. Our deal included breakfast and was the usual continental style, although had I had to pay for it on a daily basis then possibly not, the free internet acess was also a plus. Taxis to the centre are fairly cheap between 5 and 7 euro and to walk is about 20 mins and is pretty much a straight road which is signposted (similarly on the way back we followed the sign to the arc di triomph). If you decide to get the tour bus the blue line runs near the zoo and is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. To get there walk underneath the arc, down through the couple of parks, the bus stops near the zoo. Barca itself is lovely and I would always recommend it, whilst not a majorly religious person I was taken aback by the Sagrada da Familia which is truly awesome. One thing though, if you get the tour buses now it is an audio journey rather than the rep speaking, everywhere bus stopped in Barca you could see the amount of blue headphones dumped on various bus shelters etc. Overall a very enjoyable break and one a hotel I would recommend.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Merseyside", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but in wrong location\u201d", "Author": "hazzy1008", "ReviewID": "UR19034236", "Content": "Could not fault the hotel however the location was not very convenient.

We did take a leisurely stroll to La Sagrada on the Sunday and that only took about half an hour. We didn't bother eating at any of the restaurants close by, we preferred to be in the busier areas. We stayed room only but did pay the 13 euros each to have breakfast on our last day. It was a buffet breakfast with fresh fruit, salamis, cheese, breads, cereals etc. It was mostly cold food although you could do your own toast, as you usually can at a hotel breakfast.

Firstly part of the reason we booked the hotel was due to the fact it had a pool. In reality the \"pool\" is a 2 metre by 2 metre square stuck in a tight corner on the 7th floor of the hotel which we refered to as \"the cattle dip\". There was no seating or loungers around the\"pool\" and only 5 or 6 sun loungers crushed into a tiny area just below and to the left of the \"pool\" area with two umbrellas which meant, due to the size of the space, that even if you were able to get a seat up there - which would mean queuing for the door to be unlocked at 9.30am, then quite often you could not actually get out of the sun once it was at a certain position in the sky. For a hotel which has a \"pool\" as one of it\u00b4s main selling points I\u00b4m not sure that the area actually provided to guests qualifies, especially given the number of hotel rooms and so guests to the actually facilities offered. The free mini bar also sounded great but realistically all it contains is a couple of small bottles of water, coca cola and some non-alcoholic beer. Once you take into account the fact that the pool and mini bar promise is not quite what it seems you are left feeling particularly peeved when the hotel staff tell you they do not have an iron or ironing board in the whole hotel and that you have to pay the extra to use the hotel laundry facilities. For us who were attending a wedding the hotel managed to fleece us out of just under 30 Euro simply to have a suit and shirt ironed! Some other more minor issues included the air con in the room being so weak that I hardly noticed it was on and spent most of our stay absolutey boiling, admitedly it works in the hotel foyer but not in the upstairs corridors or seemingly our room unfortunately. The restaurant is more like a canteen with the tables in the lobby area and the menu leaving a lot to be desired. This is not really a restaurant but more a cafeteria if they are being honest. The room is very minimalist, to the point that there is so little lighting I spent most of the time in my room feeling like a mole as I scratched around to try and find things in the dark. Finally the bathroom was so small and built in such a wierd shape that you had to close the door just to get to the toilet, only the door didn\u00b4t propery close. The shower screen also did not fit properly so with each shower the floor flooded meaning that any attempts to actually exit the tub became a game of \"lets not break your neck\" on the flooded tiled floor. All in all this hotel does not offer a very good deal unless you are happ poor value for your mony. From looking at other places during our stay I can honestly say we would not be staying with them in future and that your money could be much better spent elsewere and provide a much more pleasurable stay in Barcelona.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "india", "Title": "\u201cGreat Find!\u201d", "Author": "alieninny", "ReviewID": "UR17145553", "Content": "Just got back from Barcelona... stayed at Confortel Auditori for five nights.

It was by far the most expensive of the 4 hotels we visited, but we thought it would be nice to splurge on our last stay. Overall the Confortel Auditori was about what I expected - very modern (appropriate, I thought, for the city of the \"modernistas\"); well-located *if* you are willing to use the fantastic Barcelona metro system (which I highly recommend); sparkly clean; loaded with features (free Internet PCs, though often unavailable, free mini-bar). However... I am only giving this hotel 3 stars because for a relatively expensive hotel it had numerous little flaws that marred the experience. Right off the bat our room request was screwed up - we were very clear that we needed 2 beds (it was printed on our confirmation) but our room had only 1 double. It required a most unpleasant scene at the desk, and threats to leave before they rectified this (their first 5 responses were simply \"sorry, nothing we can do\" - wrong answer!) The flaws, mostly minor, continued... Though the weather was generally cool the hotel's interior was quite warm where not air-conditioned, even at night. This meant that we either had to use the AC (which often triggers my wife's allergies) or keep the window open. Thankfully, there was a window that opened onto the hotel's interior, but you simply couldn't both have the window open and use the privacy curtains (which were necessary in this case). Just one of several little design flaws. Here's another one: This was the only hotel I can ever recall where it was impossible to control the two reading lights separately - they were either both on or both off. Breakfast: Skip it. For 13 Euros (almost triple any other hotel on our trip) you could do much better anywhere else. They couldn't even provide a proper hard-boiled egg - apparently they didn't know that a boiled egg must be rinsed in cold water to allow easy peeling. Honestly, for 13 Euros...

We are so glad we took their advice. Although originally we were bummed we couldn't find a decent place within Placa de Cataluna (the main city square), we were glad we chose the Confortel because at night time it was secure, quiet, and clean. The hotel was very modern and hip for young travelers, and the staff members were very plesant, helpful and accomodating. Not to mention we were just close enough to the city with a 5 minute Metro ride. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The only down side to the trip is that the hotel did not provide irons, therefore we could not iron our clothes.

It does exactly what it says on the tin, there was a range of soft drinks and beer freshly topped up every day and we never had to pay a penny for any of them. The location was good, with a metro station virtually at the end of the block. There was also an excellent chinese restaurant within 100m of the front door.
