However there is no way I will ever stay there again. What is good about Ercoli is mainly its location: it is quite central, near to a subway station and it is a convenient starting point for excursions into the city. For such a location, the night fee is also reasonable. Keep in mind though that this hotel does not have its own building. It is a small facility within a large historical building. A buiding that hosts another small hotel and a few private apartments, too. It is not something uncommon in Rome and some people might find it \"exotic\". I just did not like it. The new management had the hotel's interior renovated and the result is absolutely pleasant, but... you just should have seen my room! It was tiny small! Although equpped with a nice closet, a small safe and a small last-generation tv, it was a mouse trap! Even worse, the only window could not be open for some scaffolding was obstructing it and I spent 3 days in total darkness. Finally it was ice cold! No matter, how high I set the temperature of the heater, I only got cold air out of it. And there was no chance to get any help from the reception as from 7 pm (even earlier) to 8 am (when I was there) the only staff available was an old gentleman, uncapable of any assistance. Also, bear in mind that, as it is a small hotel, you can hear any single word spoken at the reception! But the really amusing part of the story still has to come: the bathroom. So incredibly tiny that they had to leave the clean towels on my bed; So incredibly tiny that there was no way to keep one's toiletries anywhere! The smell coming out from the shower was not particularly appealing either! I must say though that everything was clean and the room was provided with extra blankets and an extra pillow. Finally the breakfast was good. As I said, for a 2-star hotel you should not expect more that tee, coffee, cereals, yougurth, bread, croissants and some cheese. The fruit looked quite... gloomy but the rest was fresh.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, FL", "Title": "\u201cHotel E.

But you get what you pay for...and in cases like Hotel Ercoli, more than we bargained for. About the property: The entrance and stairway reeked of mold making it smelly and dirty. We saw feces on the toilet seat and dead insects in the room. Breakfast was disgusting and because one of our party got food poisioning from it during our stay, we nicknamed Hotel Ercoli... \"Hotel E. Coli.\" About the area: a store was broken into during our stay right near our hotel. Nothing was open late in our area, and we found the streets a dimly lit around the hotel. The elevator is old and rickety and the stairs are uneven and treacherous. Tomas (who also lives at the hotel in addition to working there) doesn't speak English and will belittle you if you don't speak Italian well. (I have two years of college level Italian, and he berated me constantly for not speaking it better as well as the rest of our group.) This is the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel, and I have traveled all over North America, Europe, and Asia. I try to be patient with hotel staff and understanding because I know they have a difficult job and you can't please everybody. At first, we tried to have a sense of humor about the staff's aggressive attitude and the dirtiness, and the air conditioning that they refused to turn on. Our patience and good humor was quickly worn thin. I only booked this hotel because of the glowing reviews here on TripAdvisor and the price, and was sorely mislead for the first time.

To make your way to Ercoli, you go up the small old fashioned elevator to the floor where it's located. When I entered the small reception area, I was welcomed by a friendly older man that didnt speak much English. Luckily my Italian gone me by. As soon as he showed me to my room, it was clear that the AC (which is advertised on their website) was not on. So, I kindly asked him to turn it on but he said they dont turn it on for another 1-2 hours (meanwhile, it was already close to 7PM and one of the hottest days this Sept). Later, I asked again to turn the AC on because the room didnt cool down after opening the window. The man turned it on but it was only blowing hot air. A few hours later, I advised him it still wasnt working so he flipped another switch but that didnt help either. Needless to say I didnt sleep that night! The next morning I asked the girl working the front desk if they can fix the AC or change my room. She said there was nothing they could do about the AC and they were fully booked. So, luckily, I find another hotel down the road at almost the same rate and checked out of Ercoli. It is interesting to see that many guests that have reviewed this hotel have had the same issue about the AC. So, if this is a consistent problem, then dont advertise the hotel has AC. Overall, the \"hotel\" might be an average budget option depending on if you are are ok with fairly dark and modern rooms that lack character.

It is located on the third floor in a building with two or three other hotels. Because of this you are given a key for the door to the building, a key to the door of the hotel and a key for your room. The hotel itself is really clean and looks very modern. Maps of Roma are provided at the reception. There's even a Spark Notes of Roma there if you need it. The rooms are also clean and modern. There are a few hundred channels on the TV, so it's impossible not to find one in your language. There's a safe. The bathroom has a big shower and comes with soap, shower cap, shampoo and skin lotion. The only problem with the room was that the A/C didn't work the first two nights. And it wasn't because it was broken, but as we realized the third night, because they had stopped the central A/C unit from the front desk. So every night when we got back to the hotel in the 30\u00b0 weather of September, we had to go to the reception and ask them to turn on the A/C. The breakfast was pretty basic, but good. Espresso, coffee, tea, milk, juice, ham, cheese, bread, croissant, fruits, yogurt, jam, honey, cereal. The biggest problem with our stay was that upon checking out we were asked to pay for our stay. Which would have been fine, except that it was our impression that we had paid online by credit card when we had reserved our room. It was explained to us that the credit card number we provided was merely for safety reasons or something like that. So on the morning of our checkout, when we were supposed to be catching a train to the airport, we had to scramble to find a way to pay the hotel. We tried three different credit cards, which after 15 minute of waiting for their payment machine, were all rejected. And then we had to run out and look for an ATM to get some cash.

We arrived in the evening, and the person on duty at reception was an old man who was helpful enough in showing us the room, but couldn't conceal his annoyance that we couldn't converse with him in Italian. I understand his frustration, but expressing it to paying guests wasn't really the thing to do... it just made for an awkward atmosphere, and we didn't feel very welcome at all. The room was clean and comfortable, but very dark, and the air conditioner sometimes didn't seem to work. Breakfast was ok, but there was hardly any choice of food, and we both got rather fed up of bread rolls and iced croissants after 4 days.

Be warned: They couldn't accept credit cards when we were there, so take cash. Great restaurant nearby was Bella Napoli on via Alessandria, inexpensive but perhaps the best pizza I've ever had. Neighborhood is also nice, quiet area, and not a var walk from Borghese, or Termini.

This is my contribution. The hotel has been refurbished wonderfully although they could do with loosing the bidet and fitting a larger shower (don't even try to bend down!) hot water intermittent depending on if next room is using it too! Lovely breakfast , quiet street. Expect to pay 105 euros for a double with ensuite. Very friendly staff, reasonable position from sites (15 mins walk) Don't forget Vatican is closed Sundays , although you might get lucky and see the pope on the steps instead (as we did a few weeks ago)", "Date": "June 9, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Co Kildare, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in ROme\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1844267", "Content": "The hotel is small but very comfortable and the staff very friendly. Our only criticism would be the showers - they are very small and the controls don't appear to work too well. However , for us it was more than adequate - plenty of clean towels every day. Value for money you couldn't get much better. Location wise extremely central, most places can be walked to if you don't mind a 15/20 minute walk. We can also recommend La Cantinola on Via Calabria (just around the corner) very good food at reasonable prices, also Taverna La Baita just up on Via Lucania, both represented good food at excellent value. Don't attempt the Piccolo Abruzzo can't remember the street but also close by - downstairs, looks good wonderful array of fresh food on display but you don't get to eat it. If you do go make sure you ask how much before you eat - it is a 'suggestion menu' and you get what they think you should have - we were totally ripped off there we were charged 45 euro per head whilst the previous two we paid 20 euro a head for equally good food.", "Date": "April 28, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Ercoli", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d288970-Reviews-Hotel_Ercoli-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$86 - $198*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Collina, 48</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "288970", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d1/83/d1833898e2b0ffc26f030385814d24a81large.jpg"}}
