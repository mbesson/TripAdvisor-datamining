Honestly, since the hotel changed into a NH it's the worst hotel I've ever been at. 1. We arrived at 3 p.m (15.00 CET) and we've been told that our room wouldn't be ready until 6 p.m. No comments. 2.The room was the smallest I've ever seen in my life although we've booked a superior one. There was only space for the bed and one chair. The bathroom was so small that it was difficult to have a shower. 3. The breakfast was poor: some ham, cheese, only orange juice... No choise. Overall experience was bad. We could have stayed until 5 p.m. on Sunday (because we've booked late check-out, not because we've been offered...) but left (without breakfast...) early in the morning. Will not come again. Makes no sense to pay for this hotel.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201c4 Star hotel with big room for improvement\u201d", "Author": "Citytraveller85", "ReviewID": "UR33320874", "Content": "I have been staying at the NH Victoria Palace mid June 2009 and have been very dissapointed with what I have got for my money. First of all the rooms were different as advertised on the hotel website, they were much smaller and less stylish as promised. Furthermore, all the staff did have very very little command of the English language, which I found to be the biggest problem whilst staying at the hotel. This might have been acceptable at a hostel or a small local family run hotel, but surely not for an international upper class hotel chain like NH. I therefore would not recommend this hotel further as you do not get value for money at this hotel nor the service you would expect from a 4 star hotel.", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Victoria Palace", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1164424-Reviews-NH_Victoria_Palace-Madrid.html", "Price": "$68 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Juan De Toledo 4</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">San Lorenzo Del Escorial</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28200</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1164424", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/44/5e/445ef45bafa19a62ce4c9b67fc7dfe9a1large.jpg"}}
