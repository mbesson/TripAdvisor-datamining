We had a nice balcony - that was a good length and spotlessly clean, and the bathroom was modern - and the shower had great water pressure, but the bedroom and living room both showed their age. The living room was narrow and the TV armoire crowded the room from one side and the oversized 1990's type couch from the other. In my opinion, the room furnishings need to be updated - while maintaining a classical look, and the wet bars - with drop ceilings definitely need \"work\".

We had never been to Vancouver, weren't sure we would ever visit again, so we wanted to make the most of our four night stay. The criteria that sold me on Wedgewood were balconies, piano bar and location. And by location I mean central to all the neighborhoods by foot since we did not intend to rent a car. As for the piano bar, the fact that the hotel's Bacchus Lounge was listed as the best hotel bar in Vancouver meant we always had a place to retreat to at the end of the day. The Wedgewood is nearly at the apex of Granville Street (which comes in from the airport) and Robson Street (which is the popular shopping district). From there my wife and I hoofed it to Gas Town, China Town, Yale Town and the West End, none being much farther than one mile. While we didn't use public transportation, the Vancouver City Centre Station was perhaps a block and a half away. A mere five minute walk past the Museum of Art and Robson Park. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a suite upon check-in. My only regret is that our room did not face Robson Park. But we weren't there to look down on the street scene so much as to be part of the street scene so the added space of the suite was appreciated. As you would expect of a 4 star boutique hotel, service was first class. The bell hop met us at the curb and by asking our name, the receptionist already had our reservation pulled up when we approached to check-in. Thereafter, while we never saw the maid, our room was tidied up when we departed for the day and the turn down service included fresh cookies when we returned for the night. My wife's favorite thing was the spacious, marbled bathroom with both a cozy Jacuzzi tub and ample tiled shower stall. After a long day walking my wife assured me that the Jacuzzi jets were a nice way to rejuvenate her body as well as her soul. Finally, did I mention Bacchus Lounge? That is where Danny and Stacy, bartenders extraordinaire, offered plenty of local insight about things to do and places to be while we were in town. In addition they offered up local micro-brewed beer and refreshing cocktails. We also bent the ear of Tamara and Leann, the lounge waitresses, to get their favorites for breakfast and dinner. We walked by the various Fairmonts, the waterfront Westin, the Pan Pacific and the top rated L'Hermitage.

We were told at the desk that condensation is a problem in Vancouver and that caused a problem with toilets. It is strange that we have stayed in Vancouver a half dozen times and never had this problem before. Housekeeping did put towels around the base of the toilet and controlled the situation somewhat.

The location is perfect! With some of my favourite restaurants all around (The Bellagio or Cactus club for casual and quick, Don Francesco's for a Risotto, Starbucks or Tim's for Coffee...the list goes on!) and Pacific Centre, chapters, and other Robson street shopping just a block away. The Skytrain is your link to everything entertainment and is just a block in either direction. The staff is exceptional. Friendly, bright, chatty, helpful, and genuinely pleasant to talk to. Above all the staff at the Wedgewood is what makes this hotel so very different from others in the area. Most hotels you just want to get through the lobby and to your room with maybe the odd exception to the rule; here at the Wedgewood we find ourselves linger in the lobby to chat with the Valet, Concierge, or desk staff for a moment or two. When you return from an outing they want to know how it was? What did you find at the shops or how was the hockey game? With the Wedgewood I always feel like I'm visiting family, and the box of chocolates at check-in and nightly turn down service with a bottle of water and some cookies sure does help that along!

Others have said it, and I concur. The staff are incredible. They are friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and unpretentious. After I checked in, they would greet me by name. How some staff I hadn't met before knew my name was amazing. I can only assume they pay very close attention to everything and everyone around them. They are all very easy to talk to, and if they can't help or don't know the answer to your question, they will find someone who can! I interacted with most staff (front desk, valet, housekeeping, spa), and all of them were equally great. I found their location to be quite nice. It's a fairly short walk from the subway, and though its right in downtown, I found the foot traffic to be a bit less than other streets which is nice. No frantic dodging of people as you lug your gear around, or try to get your bearings straight. It's also not too far from other sights in the area so I was able to easily explore all of downtown by foot. When I was almost to Stanley Park, I was able to hop on a public bus to quickly (not more than 10 min?) return to about two blocks from the hotel. The room I had was comfortably spacious, and I enjoyed the use of the free internet as well as the balcony (and its table and chairs) for a refreshing break outside. I found the beds to be very comfortable, and the linens were luxurious. I've stayed at better hotels that didn't have as great linens. Even the towels were wonderfully luxurious. A hotelier friend said the brand of towels and linens they use are top notch. I also enjoyed the Gilchrist & Soames toiletries. The smell was not overpowering or offensive. The hair and body products cleansed well without drying me out, and the lotion was moisturizing without being oily. I was amazed over and over again by the thoughtfulness and little touches here and there. It really shows how they tried to think of every detail to make the stay impressive. Something as minor and simple as embossing the first sheet of the toilet paper with their logo. I don't find too many hotels doing this. It wowed me only because housekeeping has to take the time out every day to that, and it's got to be straight. ;) While it looks minor, I'm sure management had to consider the extra time required for housekeeping to do this, plus the cost of the embosser plus training the staff to do it right. Anyhow, I also noticed that the hallways were lightly scented with a decorative bowl of potpourri. I could swear it was refreshed daily. It certainly was not a dusty, neglected bowl that was quickly spritzed with fragrance. I was completely floored by how clean the coffee maker was. I don't drink coffee so when there is no separate kettle for water, it's a gamble whether my tea will taste vaguely of coffee. Not only was the selection of teas delicious, the hot water that came out of the coffee maker was crystal clear with no trace of coffee. There's always the possibility I was lucky and it was a new machine, but I highly doubt it. As for the spa, it's just as fantastic as the rest of the hotel. I had my travel companion get a massage there, and his experience was perfect. According to a friend in the spa business, their offerings and his experience indicate it's a quality spa. Apparently, their signature Thai massage is uncommon since it's hard to find certified masseuses for Thai massages so I was told that if it's offered, it should be tried. Well, my friend returned as a lump of goo with a priceless expression that reflected this. The staff were very professional and constantly made sure he was comfortable and informed of every step during the treatment so that there would not be any unpleasant surprises. They would also accommodate requests if you were uncomfortable about something. When booking the treatment, I must have taxed the patience of the person who spoke to me as I had no experience with spas and massage treatments before. It took me a while with a lot of questions before I fully comprehended the different options available, and what it all meant, but never once was she impatient or irritated with me. She was very very helpful in guiding me to choose the right treatment. Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the Wedgewood. I also stayed in two other hotels in the area during my trip but Wedgewood was hands down my favorite even though the other hotels were either on par or considered better. The \"better\" hotel was indeed very very nice and worthy of its categorization, but I loved how the Wedgewood was warm, cozy, luxurious and friendly in a way that made it feel like home. For the money, it's well worth it. I enjoyed my stay so much, I would go back to Vancouver just to stay here again (but I'd return to Vancouver anyway since I really enjoyed the area).", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cElegant relaxation\u201d", "Author": "UKexpatNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR86271590", "Content": "When we arrived we were greeted by an exceptionally friendly valet - this was a pattern as all of the valets we interacted with were friendly and helpful, as were the reception staff.

All of our family and our guests were very pleased with their rooms, and one party was easily accommodated when they wanted to upgrade. As parents of the bride, we were given a large suite facing Robson Square with a lovely balcony, and two bathrooms. The latter was brilliant, as we hosted the bride and the four bridesmaids on the morning of the wedding in our room as they all got ready. We were treated exceptionally well by the hotel staff for our many requests (extra cookies for the bridal party while travelling around during the wedding photos, fetching things from our valet-parked car, allowing us to have some wedding photos taken in the public areas, providing space for the decoration of our little school bus which transported the bridal party, etc), who were always cheerful and accommodating. The front desk staff were more than helpful (checking flights, printing boarding passes, giving restaurant suggestions) and the doormen were cheerful even though we were constantly coming and going and requiring frequent valet service. We had the rehearsal dinner in the Library Room of Bacchus, the hotel dining room, and it was perfect. Wonderful size for 18 people, and excellent food and amazingly professional and attentive service. The rehearsal and hospitality get-together were held in the Eton/Cambridge room, and that also worked out exceptionally well.

With both of us sharing Punjabi ancestry and a Sikh spiritual background, we had multiple opportunities to celebrate with our loved ones. Planning for all of these events was no small feat! But celebrating was a ton of fun! The day of the wedding, we were both up super early (as the Bride, I was up by 4:30 am to be ready for 8:00 am and my fabulous groom was up around 6:00 am), after pre-wedding photos, we headed to the Gurduara (Akali Singh Sikh Temple, Vancouver, BC), and really appreciated the very sacred ceremony that has connected us on multiple levels. After the post wedding pictures and some post wedding festivities, we headed to the Wedgewood Hotel. We were greeted promptly by the valet, who was very welcoming. We headed into the lobby and were greeted by the front desk clerk who quickly checked us in and confirmed our dinner reservation. We were extremely impressed by the prompt, friendly and welcoming service. We then, placed our belongings in our room and headed down for dinner. We had the roasted chicken dinner for 2 (a Sunday night tradition at the Wedgewood and hopefully an anniversary tradition for us!) and it was amazing! The service was incredible (again!) and every aspect of our dining experience was perfect. Our attentive server congratulated us on our wedding and brought out a wonderful dessert plate for us to enjoy. The table next to us were celebrating a wedding anniversary and asked if they could send over a bottle of champagne. Although, we graciously declined, it continued to highlight the coziness of this wonderful hotel. We then left for a walk (as Vancouverites, we know the city well but would never think to spend a night at a hotel - this was a total treat) and returned to our very comfortable and quiet room. As we had been up so early and were scheduled for a family lunch the next day, we soon melted into the king size bed. The next morning, we got ready and headed down for breakfast. Again, the service and the food was perfect! The manager at one point noticed that I had slipped my shawl over my shoulders and promptly but on the heat - and came over to tell me the room would be warming up soon. Many organizations strive to excel when it comes to customer service and have a very challenging time with this art form ... that may sound a bit over the top but with the decline of customer service, I have to argue that providing excellent customer service has become an art form. The Wedgewood Hotel has this art-form mastered. To attend to the subtle nuances - seeing a guest put a shawl on and responding to that prior to any mention of it - illustrates how this art form is embraced by the Wedgewood team.

The rooms were elegantly appointed and comfortable, the bar has to be one of the best hotel bars in North America, and the location near Robson Street is excellent. Great attention to every detail. I have to single out the folks in the kitchen at Bacchus, however, for they truly went the extra mile for us. During our first full day in Vancouver we pulled up several tasty-looking Dungeness crabs while salmon fishing near the Fraser River. Lee Parsons and his talented sous chef graciously agreed to prepare some of the crabs for us for dinner that night, and what a feast! The tarragon beurre blanc was divine, and the accompaniments were perfect. It will easily be one of the more memorable meals my husband and I have had together.

A piano player, wonderful drinks and an excellent light menu. There was a mixed group but no one seemed to mind that we were in jeans. It is a popular after the theater spot to eat.

One major thing I noted is that we very rarely heard other guests while in our room. We could hear a door close every now and then, but other than that it felt like we had the entire floor to ourselves.

I was a little nervous, given the couple of less-than-wonderful reviews I read on trip advisor. For those of you questioning whether or not to go, I must say: DO NOT HESITATE booking at the Wedgewood! I simply cannot say enough wonderful things about the Wedgewood and the amazing staff. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the friendliest doorman (Martin) who made a great first impression. He was always quick to retrieve our car, hold the door open for us, or hail a cab for us. The staff at the Reception Desk wereALWAYS cheerful and helpful, and especially our dear Gillian, who helped us numerous times, always with a smile. Our Deluxe Executive Room room was terrific -- loved the bed (comfy with great linens) and absolutely perfect pillows. TV was large and easy to see from bed and was housed in a lovely armoire. The TV was also visible from the in-room tub (which was great fun and was CLEAN). I adored the marble bathroom and magnificent shower, which was made of tumbled marble tile -- just lovely! Frette towels were divine. Dinner at Bacchus (the on-site restaurant) was just amazing ... great food (try the mussel soup!), warm, romantic ambiance. We had drinks in the lounge one night and were so comfortable that we stayed for dinner. On the day of our 30th anniversary, we treated ourselves to massages in the Spa, and what a delight!!!! If you want to stay in a hotel that makes you feel pampered in every way, go to the Wedgewood. As I said, I was a little nervous, but if you are appreciative of fine antiques, lovely Oriental carpets and other special pieces, you will love this place ... very \"upscale European\" feel to it, although the rooms are certainly larger than any you will find in Europe! I searched for MONTHS AND MONTHS for a place to go to celebrate our 30th, and I was not disappointed. The biggest compliment to the Wedgewood was my husband's reaction -- he was thrilled with the place, and did not want to leave. I simply cannot imagine how someone would think the place is \"worn\" or \"tired\" -- a competitor writing a review, perhaps?

Maid service was exemplary; a drain was clogged in our room- an engineer was up to fix it inside five minutes. Very professional. The hotel facilities are very dated: the carpets aren't threadbare or worn, but they sure are old. The rooms were very clean but the furnishings were old, (but necessarily in poor repair). The decor is very dowdy. Perhaps stylish many years ago, but those days are gone- The Wedgewood reminds me of the Drake Hotel in Chicago: its best days are long past. The location is very central to downtown- everything is walking distance. Fun restaurants (Bin 941), cool clubs, awesome shopping, and Granville Island are within a few short blocks. Stanley Park is a short 12-15 minute walk north. I would not stay here again. The very dated decor, low ceilings, and dark hallways are not to my taste. I think this hotel badly needs a renovation to justify its exorbidantly high prices.

I really have mixed feeling about the place. Let me explain! The Wedgewood is a non-descript (70s office-schlock) building with a dirty canopy over the entrance. Not a good entrance. For 'one of the best hotels in Canada' and the 'best boutique hotel it was incredibly disappointing. Inside is a mish-mash of faux decor, heavily dated. Made me feel instantly like we made the wrong choice. I waned to walk out. In another city, it would have been downright cheap. No joking. Nasty-looking faux facade (clearly visible) on the reception area, low ceilings in the foyer with tiled mirrors on those same ceilings. Tiled mirrors! Ouch! I thought they went out in the 70s. And here's my beef: I really couldn't get over how dated downtown Vancouver was at street level. Tacky signage. More than a fair share of drifters. And the Wedgewood kept pace with that, but we're taking a 70s/80s pace. Read on! For one of the best rooms in the hotel, the one-bedroom suite was extremely disappointing (I'm being polite here!). It was really a decent-sized room that had a wall inserted down the middle to create the bedroom/sitting room divide. But if anyone had the sense to see it, it would have been far more cosy to have no wall in the first place and leave it at one good-sized room. Instead we had two awkward long narrow rooms, and ended up skirting around the end of the bed (in the bedroom) and the side of the tv (in the 'lounge room'). Rather than a luxurious hotel bedroom suite, it actually ended up feeling like a badly designed cheap apartment. We had an 8th floor view over Robson Square (a building site) but there are far better views to be had in Vancouver from far cheaper hotel rooms. Generally, the hotel felt as if it was squeezed into a building that did not accommodate what it was trying to do. Nowhere was this more apparent than when you arrived in the 'spa floor'. The spa is on the second floor. But it has clearly been recently created and shoved into a low ceiling floor where previously there were bedrooms. Shortly after leaving the lift on the second floor and entering the spa reception, you are overwhelmed by a nasty locker-room smell, as if there is no air getting in. As you look around, the cause is easy to see. The ceiling is only slightly above your head, and there is no light or window in sight. We left that floor quickly. We did not book any spa treatments - it was inconceivable to arrive down to that floor to have a treatment, and feel like you were having a treat! Anything but. As for services: We emailed the Concierge ahead of our stay to book some (stated) restaurants. Simple phone-calls for the concierge as we had already picked the restaurants. Although, to be fair, we did ask for a 'new and upbeat restaurant' recommendation on the first night - and they came up trumps with Chambar. Excellent. But we also put 3 different requests to them about trips (to Victoria etc.). When we arrived, we were introduced to the 'head' concierge, and other than a simple direction to the local 'hop-on-hop-off'' tour shuttle, we got little help on any of our other requests. In fact, we left with the distinct impression that he could do nothing for us. Let me put this into perspective: I had seen on the net that there was a particular classical music performance in Vancouver and asked him to book a ticket. He not only said that he 'was not familiar' with where the performance was on, but had tried to contact them but got no response. And there it was left. I was shoved a page with the contact details, and the impression he could do no more. I already had the page he gave me from the internet. For a 5* hotel on my vacation, I wanted the 'here are the tickets you requested' or 'I haven't been able to secure them so far but I am trying all the time to get them and I will let you know as soon as I have word' service. And I would have tipped accordingly. But no. Any concierge worth their salt would have insisted that they were constantly trying to get me tickets, and got them, as they were easily available. Poor show. We didn't consult the concierge for anything after that. When you read the guide books, the Wedgewood constantly gets this 'best service' and 'cute touches' accolades. Hmmmm. Ok, when we got to our 'suite', we had a note and a box of chocolates from the owner welcoming us. Every evening, a sultry housekeeper delivered water and cookies. All that's nice. But, it was perfunctory. And it could never offset the other problems. The room itself (apart from the ill-advised wall-split), was passable. Tacky, dated curtains, like a bad bed&breakfast. Ouch!! Only saving grace was the very comfortable bed thankfully. Top class linen. And equally with towels in the bathroom. And very nice bathroom, but again awkwardly designed (no place to hang a towel etc.). In the context of the rest of the room, the bathroom was all out of place. It was faux-roman decor and really an awkward mix - it was as if they spent a lot of money on the bathrooms, but couldn't care about the bedrooms. So, is there anything good about the Wedgewood? The Bacchus restaurant is. We dined in the best restaurants in Vancouver (C, West, Tojos), but I have to say the Bacchus nailed it with the best of them. Again, in keeping with the rest of the hotel, it's all the same dated decor (like they haven't done anything to it for decades) but they kind of have it a bit right on the luxurious-decadent front. Heavy curtains, low lighting etc. The food is spot-on. It's heavy rich French-style food, but I couldn't recommend it more if that's what you want. If I was visiting Vancouver again, I would not stay at the Wedgewood. I'd go back to Bacchus, but not the rooms. We got to realise that Vancouver is all about its natural beauty. Snow-capped mountains, beaches, pacific ocean and the largest city park in North America, not to mention the mod glass sky-scrapers hugging the water. Given that, I would in future go to one of the high-rise hotels that has the best views of this natural beauty. And probably those near the water. I understand most of the Vancouver high-rise hotels are dated-conference-hotels (which is why we picked the Wedgewood!) but after being in what is Vancouver's best 'boutique hotel', I would very gladly take a large standard conference hotel room with a view any day over the poor value and expectations that were sadly under-served at the Wedgewood.

I booked 2 rooms, one for my family and the other for my parents, who arrived 3 days earlier. I made reservations directly with the hotel, whose manager assured me that I would get the same rates as found in other hotel booking sites. Having checking the charges in these sites, I was comfortable that that was the case. We made reservations for the Executive room but I was pleasantly surprised when they upgraded me to a Deluxe Executive upon my arrival. The Deluxe Executive room was a fairly large room with a good view and soaker tub in the room (not the bathroom). I would describe the hotel as smallish but with plenty of personality. The hotel's location makes it a definate plus - it's right in the middle of town and a good walking distance to all the good restaurants in the area. The staff were all pleasant and helpful. On our final night at the hotel we dined at the award winning Bacchus which greets you when the enter the hotel's main entrance. If you want a quiet dinning night out, forget it! The dinning area is practically in the bar area and the noise levels make conversation difficult. The food was above average but so were the prices.

We wanted this trip to be special, and so we spent quite some time deciding which hotel to stay in. At the end we decided on Wedgewood. Big mistake. Upon our arrival, we were told we were placed in \"penthouse suite,\" which we assumed was an upgrade - it wasn't! We have made a reservation for a USD$269+tax Executive Suite, which was supposed to have either a king or two twin beds (we requested a king in our reservation). The room we were placed in had a double bed! When we got to our room, we thought it was a mistake and called the reception to let them know. We were told it was the only room they had available, and that that's what executive suit was supposed to look like anyway. The room was tiny!! I'm attaching photos. That night, we were too tired to argue, so the next morning we talked to receptionist again, and were told that we should have \"read the fine print\" on Expedia (where we made the reservation), and that the king-size bed was \"a request\" from us they basically didn't have to meet. By the way, here's the description of the room from Wedgewood website: ****Executive Suite:***** Studio room with mini-bar and private balcony. Extremely spacious, bright and beautifully appointed, they are always in demand. Bedding - One King-Size Bed or Two Doubles. Just look at the pictures, please, and tell me if that's what you would expect from that description! Anyway, after complaining to three different people we got \"an upgrade\" for our second night, after which we were placed in a room with a king bed and a slightly larger living area with a nice soaking tub. The staff at the hotel made it look as if they were doing us a favor, they never apologized for our inconvenience and generally were arrogant throughout our stay. To top it off, my brand-new car was dented in valley parking (which by the way costs additional $26 per night) during our stay. We only found the dent after we drove a few hours away from Vancouver, so we didn't complain because, frankly, after all the \"service\" we received at the hotel we decided it was pretty useless. It was a small dent, but you can imagine it didn't add anything to our overall experience with our stay. Needless to say, I don't think we are ever coming back. For that $$$, there are other hotels to stay in the city were we are bound to get better service than this. Maybe if we were placed in the right room from the beginning our experience would have been better, it is the only way I can explain all the positive reviews on this website.

The Wedgewood definitely gets 'thumbs-up', but I don't necessarily see it as a must-do on any future visits. (Note- my wife really did love it.) We spent three nights at the Wedgewood (plus one at the Westin-Bayshore). For our anniversary, my wife and I visited Vancouver and picked the Wedgewood based on researching several sources. It's a very cozy, friendly feeling hotel in the middle of the downtown shopping area and is walking distance to shopping, food and the art museum (walking yes, but need I mention that it rains a lot in October?). The desk staff and room staff were all very friendly and helpful. The Wedgewood's overall value for us was the location and apartment-like feel of our one bedroom suite with balcony overlooking the park. If you want just a 'nice place to sleep', there appears to be a lot of decent places that can save your money (and you can buy your own cookies to eat while you turn down your own bed). You will want a car to do any sightseeing. The Room: Clean, and a great view from the balcony overlooking Robson Square. The king bed, linens and pillows were all very comfortable. Nice-sized modern bath with separate shower. All are a cut or two above average. Very clean room overall. You get a real key for your door. Service: Front desk staff was very helpful. Scott, the desk mgr, KNOWS his restaurants (thanks buddy, for Bin941 and Chambar)! The room staff was also very pleasant and prompt when we needed more towels. (Yes, there are cookies served with turn-down service... I can't get too excited since they're good, they're cookies but you are paying for them.) We didn't try the onsite restaurant or bar. Food is a big part of why we travel. These were the Vancouver restaurants recommended by the Wedgewood: 'Bin 941' is five blocks from the hotel. Funky tunes, very small (a little loud), hip and overall really, really excellent food and fun! Primarily a tapas menu and a great wine selection. ($100-$150C) 'Chambar': Outstanding!!! A Michelin-rated chef recently opened this great eatery. We eat out a lot and this was one of the top three restaurant meals we've ever had. Creative martini list and eclectic food (ostrich?!). Appetizer of mussels and fries/pommes frites was simply the best we've ever had. ($100-150C) Tojos (sushi). We picked this from the guidebooks because it was a must-do (NOT). Really good, but it almost ruined our trip because it was OUTRAGEOUSLY PRICED. It's out of the way from the Wedgewood, in a cheezy office building, doesn't have a great decor but the food was very good. We love sushi and sat at the bar to get the full experience. At the bar, you don't keep the menu and it's your responsibility to stop the chef. The guidebooks say to give the chef a budget and I strongly suggest to heed the warning! My wife and I had one small flask of sake and about four beers total. We also weren't overly-filled when it came time for the check.... (ooh, it's painful to re-live it)... $400!!! I figured later that the cash register rang to the tune of $40 every time the chef touched our plate. The chef smilingly told us to \"please make sure and come back\" - he just loved us! Forget your dream of deciphering the celebrity autographs on Tojo's wall and get your 'cold dead fish' someplace else. It was fun, it was a good meal and it was a rip-off. Ya kinda just walk away feeling used. Vancouver is a great city with a lot of things to do (bring rainwear) and a lot of really good places to eat. People everywhere are very friendly.

It did face the nice side of the street (the art side with a fountain view), and it had a small balcony. Our bathroom had a soaker tub/shower combination and one sink. It was tiny.

However, if we go back to Vancouver I might try to get a place on the water, instead of in the middle of downtown. On a positive note, the downtown location is within walking distance of both the Seabus to North Vancouver and the Aquabus to Granville Island, not to mention many downtown attractions. However, a downtown location comes with negatives, too, including valet parking, and typical urban core problems like aggressive panhandlers and some pretty undesirable areas within blocks. The hotel itself was very nice. We got a good rate through the Tourism Vancouver website, and, as promised, it was upgraded to a Junior Suite since one was available. We had requested a room on the \"nice\" side (see other reviews), but none was available so our room overlooked the back alley. Not a deal breaker for us, since we mostly used the room for sleeping. Very comfortable bed, and a nice shower. When we were there (March 10 through 14, 2005), the hotel was undergoing some renovations... one of the two elevators was frequently covered with padding inside. Again, no big deal for us. My partner said she heard some construction noise one morning. The lobby is extremely nice (with a large fireplace), and the bellmen/valets are accommodating and very pleasant. Other than the cost, the valet parking was no problem at all. We called down about 15 minutes before leaving, and the car was always ready and waiting. Front desk staff were knowledgeable, but I felt some of them were a little aloof. Not a lot, but enough to bug me a little. I just didn't feel like all of them went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating despite the small size of the hotel. Turn down service at night with complementary cookies and bottled water; also a complementary box of chocolates upon arrival and a newspaper every day. The turn down service also refreshed towels and bath room supplies at night if needed... a nice touch. Overall we felt the maid service was above average, but a little spotty at times. We would definitely recommend the hotel to prospective visitors.

I have stayed in many great hotels before and I must say that the Wedgewood has been one of the best; I would not hesitate to go back. The room was perfect, with all the commodities but with an extra touch (we stayed in one of the Wedgewood Suites - greatly reduced rates in the winter months!), the service was outstanding (the staff was great with our 18 months old son even though this was clearly not a place where many babies get taken) and the location couldn't be better (right in the middle of all the shops and restaurants in Downtown Vancouver). The little touches we appreciated: being given a private area in the Bacchus restaurant and bar lounge so that we could sip some cocktails while keeping our son with us (children are not admitted in the main bar), the amazing room service (great food from the Bacchus restaurant - the desserts are a pure delight - and the service is faultless), the unexpected baby toiletries in the room, the best blueberry pancakes I've ever tasted and the complementary Belgium chocolates and nightly freshly baked cookies. I did not get to try the spa which I regret and the gym room is a bit small but it does have all the usual required equipment. There is no swimming pool which is a shame but I really don't see where they could fit one anyway. I loved the Bacchus restaurant - for Breakfast, you get to sit in big comfortable armchairs by the fireplace (with a roaring fire in it in the winter!). Although we didn't get to eat there in the evenings because of our son's bedtimes, the restaurant certainly was very popular, always full, with live piano music every night.

This should have been great but the terrace was so plain - quite ugly - the outlook on buildings - in my view, without any charm. Sadly, indoors, much about our large room looked slightly tired - the desk noticeably damaged and the bedspread slightly frayed. There were several mixups - our cookies were missed althogether one night; on another only one of us received these. No complimentary slippers were provided. That earlier reviewer was also right about only artifical flowers on each lobby floor and the plastic rubbish bins in the bathrooms - what a pity! Even the pens appeared to be 'bottom of the range'. We were also left embarrassingly hungry after our tiny (though tasty) portions when we ordered room service for dinner. Service was adequate but I have had better. We were told we would need to ask for the twice daily room servicing as this was not automatic (no ice when we came in for a lunchtime drink!)
