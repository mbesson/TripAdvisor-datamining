Last year 2 friends and I decided to have a weekend get together in London and I'd been meaning to review this ever since. When my friend got their the guy on reception actually made a pass at her and grabbed her hand when he gave her the room key. She was on edge until we arrived and told us how sleezy he was coming on to her. The room - a triple was tiny - one double bed with no room on either side of it against the back wall and a single. We had to climb over the single to get to the double. The rooms stunk and the hotel had a strong smell of animal fat/ lard. We had a shared bathroom, two floors down. The bathroom was occupied almost everytime we went to use it and one of us got up in the night to use the bathroom to find some very dodgey looking guys hanging around on the stair case outside the bathroom door. The generally decor was run down, shoddy and frankly gross. I've honestly stayed in better hotels in the 3rd world. We couldn't get away quick enough. I wouldn't stay another night even if I was paid to! there are other hotels in the same price bracket in central London, that are ensuite, clean and safe. Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if someone had complained about being jumped on or attacked during the night using the bathroom.

We had booked to stay at the Langland for 4 nights, however after 5 minutes sat in the 'living room' (next to a ladies sanitary bin) we were already looking on our iphone for alternative accommodation. I informed the receptionist that we were not prepared to spend four nights as the level of cleanliness was far from hygienic, however we were pessimistic that we would find alternative accommodation at such short notice, we were assured that we would 'love' the room therefore agreed to pay for one night @ \u00a3135 (please bear in mind that we had not seen the room at this point). The room was disgusting, unhygienic and inhabitable!! The beds where covered in hair (i assume human hair, however the room smelt like wet dogs therefore i could not be certain), the once red carpet was soiled with suspicious white stains, which were also found on the bedding. For \u00a3135 per night one would expect at least a toilet in the room, however what we got was a filthy sink basin positioned millimetres from the head board of one of the rock hard beds. The furniture in the room appeared to have been bought from a car boot sale over 50 years ago, with wear and tear to reflect that. After 10 minutes of itching and coughing (i am asthmatic and the inch deep dust set about a large coughing bout), we made a unanimous decision that we couldn\u2019t spend another second in the room. Due the cleanness of the hotel and condition of the room we demanded a refund. After a good 20minute heated debate with the stubborn receptionist, we were still no closer to seeing our \u00a3135. At one stage i asked the employee if he would stay in the room with his family, to which he replied \" NO \".

We paid on arrival and then went to the room. The room was not en-suite but we knew this. We found we were not the only inhabitants of this room from only one step inside. All of the 3 beds were covered in bugs crawling around. We all started itching with the thought and daren't even put anything down on the floor. The decor was shabby but we could have lived with that. But the whole room was unclean - dirty net curtains, carpets. The bedding was clean...just covered in bugs and not just small ones! We were offered another room but this was equally as unclean. Please do not put yourselves in the position we ended up, with luggage, nowhere to stay and the theatre to get to. We ended up getting another hotel a little bit further out of town and paying a bit more but it was worth it 100 times over. This hotel needs reporting to environmental health.

I booked a triple room with what appeared to be very reasonable rates for a London hotel. However , I was to discover why this hotel was cheap. We were allocated a room at the front of the hotel which was supposed to be a triple room, I've never seen a room so small for three people it whould have been barely adequate as a single room. The doulble bed and single bed were squashed up against the wall leaving approximately 1.5 feet of floor space between the wardrobe, dressing table and sink, impossible for more than one person at a time to stand. The room was very hot so had to leave the window open all the time but because of this the room was very noisy as Gower Street is very busy day and night. A fan was provided but this kind of defeated the object as this was also noisy. The room was reasonably clean apart from the net curtains which were filthy and the main curtains were torn and did not close properly, one fell down on our last day. The double bed was not actually a double but was a three quarter bed. I asked for another room but was informed that no other room was available. Breakfast on the first day was okay but on the second day it was a complete shambles. No table was available so we had to wait a long time for one. When we eventually did get seated there were no cups, glasses, cutlery, fruit juice, coffee or tea. Although poached eggs were on the menu they said they where unavailable I think they just couldn't be bothered to make them. Had the english breakfast but it wasn't very good. Badly presented, not much of it and not cooked very well. My opinion is that this hotel is cheap because it is so bad. I would advise anybody to either pay a bit more or look else where as there has got to be better hotels than this. I speak from experience as I have stayed in many hotels and worked in hotels for many years and believe that they could do much better than this.I don't know how they managed to be awarded two stars, I've stayed in hotels that had no stars that were better than the Langland.

I have stayed in many hotels all over the world, this is one of the worst ever experienced - including during my packpacker time. The rooms are dirty, and the sanitary facilities doesn't function, and are so dirty you hardly want to take a shower. The wallpaper in the rooms are hanging down and are yellow with dirt, and there were big holes in the bed linen. The so called breakfast was so bad it was difficult to swallow, and the service stopped before annonced time because the staff was having private conversations, so several guests had to leave in anger without having got any breakfast at all. The staff was in general quite impolite. This hotel should change its manager. My wife and I have had good experinces in other low cost hotels in Gower street before, but this one was terrible.

Since my October, 2006 and my April stay, the ownership changed and my reservation for April was lost,. However, Sam the new manager, gave me my same room, #13, at the same rate even though it is now a double. I use the bathroom on the landing, which like the room is always clean. Breakfast was filling and well prepared. To get to anywhere all you have to to is walk across the street where several buses stop and go to almost everywhere in London.

I did make a very large error of paying for the room up front, before I'd even seen it, and instantly realised the mistake I'd made. The whole place appears to be rotting, despite looking quite nice from the outside. The rooms are shabby, very noisey, and the matress was very lumpy. Also during the night I suffered itching from the sheets. I'd have probably got a better night's sleep in my car!
