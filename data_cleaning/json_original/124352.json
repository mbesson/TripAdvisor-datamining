The room itself was a little on the small side with two beds, a desk, fridge and 2 chairs in it, but was very functional. The overall cleanliness of the room was simply exceptional. I don't even think many 4 or 5 star hotels I have stayed at have ever been cleaner. The room was pristine. Only downside was that there was no bathtub, just a shower. Not a problem for me but could be hard if you stayed here with kids. My room was on the 3rd floor right by the elevator and I couldn't believe I never heard another guest from inside my room for the entire stay. Very quiet hotel. The free continental breakfast was very basic. They served eggs and canadian bacon every morning and they were sort of edible. This hotel originally was a Sleep Inn, but was completely remodeled and was the sort of remodel were the hotel is was completely upgraded. Location wise it is right by Sea World, you can see Journey to Atlantis and the Kraken every morning as you leave. It is off of the first exit on 528, don't let this scare you, there are NO tolls if you get off at the first exit. I - 4 is less than a mile away from the hotel. All the attractions are 10 minutes or less from the hotel. Overall I highly recommend this hotel, it is on the southern end of the International Drive corridor. Many hotels on International Drive, especially towards Universal and Wet N'Wild, are really beginning to show their age. The the South Side of the Convention Center area is really the place to be and this hotel puts you into the heart of it.

They had just put in new furniture, 42 inch flat screen TVs, and the beds were very comfortable. They provided free continental breakfast, which was just fine to get us started for the day. The manager was very courteous and allowed us an extended stay, due to our flight not leaving till 2pm. The only thing I would suggest is not using the transportation service that they called for your cab rides. They used the U.S.A Transportation & Tours, which were significantly more expensive than a regular cab, especially to the airport.

When telling taxi drivers where you are staying, you may have to refer to it as the Windsor Inn or Sleep Inn. The confusion in names made it difficult for the airline to return a piece of lost baggage, since they didn't have the new name in their computer system. We booked our room on www.hotels.ca and got a room with 2 double beds for $49/night. I stayed here on October 18-21 to visit Universal Studios and do some shopping prior to a conference at the Orange County Convention Centre. As two female travelers, we felt safe and enjoyed the many perks of staying at this hotel. LOCATION: This hotel has a fantastic location! It's located right off I-Drive, and there is an I-Trolley stop right across the street. You can easily reach both outlet malls on the I-Trolley. There is a shuttle that takes guests to Universal Studios, SeaWorld and Disneyworld. They drop-off in the morning, and return for pick-up twice in the evening. This means that you have to stay at the park for a decent amount of time. The shuttle is quick and pain-free. BREAKFAST: The breakfasts are fantastic. It is hectic around 8:30 AM when everybody is getting ready to visit the theme-parks. This makes breakfast a rather rushed affair since there are limited tables, and it is not always desirable to sit outside because of the weather. The buffet consisted of: pancakes, bacon/sausage, eggs, pastries, oranges, and juice. Of course, all of the jam included corn syrup, as did the pancake syrup. There are whole-wheat English muffins. THEME PARK TICKETS: There is a person who sells tickets to the theme parks at a 'discount.' After talking to him, I determined that purchasing from his is not that different from purchasing online. He sells Universal Studios 2-day park-to-park passes for $130 cash, or $135 with a credit card. He also had Disneyworld tickets for $30 off, however, this only applied with a group of three or more, and this was with a special 'employee voucher,' for which you had to notify him one day in advance, and go with him to the park to purchase the tickets. From my observations of his interactions with other guests, he didn't seem particularly keen to garner business, so I would probably look around for better deals. AMENITIES: The rooms were simple, but great. They hotel is newly renovated, and each has a safe. Although the bathroom had a funky odour, I think this is more likely attributed to the smell in Orlando's tap water, rather than hotel cleanliness. STAFF: I cannot describe how wonderful the staff were. We were greeted by Derek, who directed us to our room, and provided suggestions on where to eat. We also met another staff member named Derek, who was most courteous and helpful. There was no problem stowing our luggage with the desk since we went to a theme park after checking out... however, I was rather shocked that they did not ask for any ID to make sure that we were the owners when picking up our luggage afterwards. OVERALL: A wonderful hotel, and a great way to save money, particularly with a family. There's a pool and gym, and this provides a simple and affordable, yet comfortable place to relax while in Orlando.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel, excellent friendly staff, great central location.\u201d", "Author": "G B", "ReviewID": "UR119765071", "Content": "We've been to Florida many times, but this was our first hotel stay.

Breakfast is included with a limited but adequate buffet, the only slight negative is the breakfast area is on the small side, but we learned that timing our breakfast to avoid early risers and later families was best option. A suggestion for management would be to extend into the rear to complete the transformation and get 5/5. A decent size pool and pool deck with tables, chairs, parasols and sun loungers, all of which were regularly cleaned, are also available and shielded, with hedging, from general view. Laundry facilities at $4 wash and dry is situated at the end of the 2nd floor. The additional hotel charge at $2.50 daily for wifi, room safe and parking, is one of the best around.

The hotel lobby looked like something from the film 'Carry on abroad'. I felt like i needed a hard hat!!! There was no iron in the room called down to the same guy who checked us in and he told us he would bring one up within ten minutes. Needless to say i was still waiting the next day so i left a note for housekeeping and an iron was provided. Thank you!!! Although wifi was provided free it didn't work on our apple products. Really disappointing. However when i got talking to a different guy on the front desk (who was sooo helpful and kind) he explained that the wifi didn't work with apple products and other guests were having problems too. He allowed me to use the office computer to send an e-mail to family back home which i appreciated a lot and felt that his customer service was impeccable. Thank you for that. The main light in our room was faulty and flickered constantly through the night, maintenance took the lightbulb out but took three days to get fixed properly. We used the lamps which wasn't a problem but having the main light would have saved from switching all the lamps off each time we left the room. Beds were too hard and the pillows were too soft! When i ask to call a cab they provided a private car company instead of a metered cab. The price was extortionate for the distance travelled. Please if you don't want to be ripped off call your own metered cab!!! 7am in the morning is not an appropriate time to being drilling. Renovation or no renovation!!!! Would have like some literature in the room about check in/out times, orlando etc, Overall the floor we stayed on was almost finished and our room was clean and the decor pleasant. Apart from the first guy who checked us, all the other staff really pleasant and couldn't help you enough. The hotel lobby was nearly finished when we left and it was looking lovely and plush. The hotel will look fabulous when it is all finished and i think i might leave staying here until it is.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bridgend, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel and staff\u201d", "Author": "ClelX", "ReviewID": "UR118479667", "Content": "My wife and I stayed for nine nights in September.

We arrived to find the hotel in the middle of a renovation and at first had my doubts! I need not have worried. We were met at the front desk by very friendly and helpful staff. Our room was on the 2nd floor and was more that adequate and clean. We had a lovely walk in shower . There was coffee and tea making facilities in the room. We were at the front of the hotel but apart from hearing fireworks each night from Seaworld was never once bothered by any sort of noise or disturbance. We have stayed in larger and more expensive placs only to be annoyed but noisy corridors etc. The hotel has only got the one washer and dryer but is excellent value at $2 a load to wash and the same to dry and has a machine that sells detergent at a $1 a time. It is on the 2nd floor so we managed to do ours before breakfast or when home form parks. Our room had iron and ironing board, basic but who wants to spend ages ironing on holiday and has a dryer for hair as well. There is an area in the morning for free breakfast which at times can be busy but they have an outside area too. There are hot and cold drinks, cereal , breads for toast and pastries as well as porridge each morning. When this is provided free you save quite a bit. Some mornings we strolled to Village Inn, or Dennys for breakfast. When I saw the swimming pool I will admit I thought it on the small side at first but it was brillliant. For 99% of the time we were there we had the pool to ourselves it was bliss. There are a few chairs and recliners outside which could be probably updated. We did not bother taking towels with us who needs the extra weight we used the towels form our rooms and were able to get extra from the ladies who cleaned the rooms whenever we needed them. The hotel runs free shuttles to the parks but Sea World is only a 10 minute stroll away so we just walked each time. The shuttle and Lynx buses stop opposite the hotel and return outside the hotel what more could you ask for. Only once did we have quite a wait for a shuttle as there was a thunder storm on and everyone was leaving shuttles from Sea World. There are quite a few resteraunts next to the hotle Village Inn, lovely pies, Italian, Subway to name a few. Down the drive there are all the ususals like Dennys, IHop, Mcdonalds etc. Derek on the desk was very knowledgable about everything and gave us lots of good advice. There was a gentleman opposite the front desk selling trips. I read in an earlier comment that people thought he tried to rip them off. I have to disagree totally with this we arranged a day pass to the 4 Disney Parks through him and he gave us a fantastic bargain and transported us there along with others. We had pre paid all our other trips but would have been more than happy to try and arrange them with him. When we left the renovation was almost complete, the outside had been all freshly painted and when lit up at night was very welcoming. when I visit Florida again this will be my hotel to stay in.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT BUY FROM TICKET VENDOR IN LOBBY!

For the price I get what I expect. One day the maids came and picked up the dirty towels but didnt make the beds. No biggie. The beds were a bit hard, agian no biggie, they were bearable. However, my number one complaint isnt directly with the hotel, but since thy were namesless, and were located INSIDE the hotel, they must take full responsibility for the experience. Living in Miami we often travel to Orlando, we always buy our tickets from the parks and never have an issue. This time we decided to buy from the guy selling in the lobby. My parents and I were a bit weary but my husband suggested getting it from the vendor. FIRST RED FLAG- When he gave us a price he clicked his calculator, and poceeded to say something to the effect of : $115 + $115= $330 + 110= $440. You can probably see the mistake quickly but when this is told to you really quickly you tend to miss it. My husband forked over $500 and in th back of my head it sounded like a lot, but my math isnt the best. Before, the transaction was over my mom leaned over and said \"$115+$115 is $230 not $330\". So I quickly jumped and asked and he looked like a deer caught in the headlights, he even redid the WRONG math...TWICE. Maybe his apology was sincere but I didnt buy it. I think he was trying to stiff us SO BEWARE!! SECOND RED FLAG- he doesnt take down any information nor does he give you a receipt. There is no proof you have purchased from him if paying in cash. Well, my dad lost his tickt that day at Seaworld and the park said they couldnt do anything since th ticket was bought from a 3rd party. We needed to talk to the vendor. The next day when we asked him for a relacement ticket he said that wasnt his job it was the park. Ugh- no, we bought it from you. In the end, my dad needed to buy another ticket. Had he bought it from the park they would have had record of it and the would have given us another. Th dudes missing an arm so you can't miss him. Someone told us that some of these places get the tickets from \"an insider\" in the park and have no affiliation with the park. The park would never admit that, but think about it, if the park were partnered with them they would have better control.

The room was comfy as were the beds and pillows. The shower was unique for a hotel- a walk in that was large. There was a good sized pool- clean and many lounge chairs. A free breakfast- your basic continental fare, but we didn't touch it much as we were eating at the parks but it was good and plenty. The staff at the desk were very friendly and helpful too. The location is outstanding- right off International Drive (all the restaurants, shops, SeaWorld, Aquatica, ect) and is just a block up from SeaWorld and Aquatica. Only 2 things that caught our attention during our 4 night stay- #1---while we were at SeaWorld during day one, apparently the hotel changed ownership or switched franchises- either way we came back to a hotel with a sign that said Windsor Inn--not a big deal for us as we don't care what the name is but a friendly note would have been nice to expect a change as it was dark and late and we first drove by it. #2--there was a small amount of what appeared to be mold- from moisture on the ceiling above the shower--perhaps need a better exhaust fan.

Our first room was on the 4th floor and the toilet didn't flush well. We asked to be moved and they put us in another 4th floor room, but it had the same problem. We asked again to be moved and ended up on the first floor with no problems at all! The staff was very friendly and helpful, the continental breakfast was great and the outdoor pool was very nice. Once we got an acceptable room, our stay was very good with no issues. Now the shuttle offered was a whole different story! The hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the parks but there are limited pickup and drop off times, so keep that in mind during your planning. The shuttle to Universal studios was later in the morning, so we chose to pay for a cab to get there when the park opened. Besides that, the shuttle bus was very run down and in bad shape, to the point that we were concerned that it would even make it to the parks! And of course this wasn't the only hotel on the route - there were several stops before and after the Sleep Inn. The most frustrating situation is that one driver would stop at each hotel and grab a cup of coffee or a banana at the continental breakfast, even if we were way behind schedule. When someone made a comment about being behind schedule, the driver just stated that the parks don't open until 9:00 anyway, not taking into consideration that some of use were taking additional transportation to get to other parks. That was another drawback - if you were going to the Disney properties, you got dropped off and picked up at Epcot and Epcot only. If you wanted to go to the Animal Kingdom, you had to take a shuttle to Magic Kingdom then a bus to Animal Kingdom. This ended up being a 90 minute commute from the hotel! If we knew it would have taken that long, we would have taken a cab!

It's got a brilliant location, so if you're there for Disney/Universal/Seaworld etc, it's a brill spot. Due to the location, the trolley (green bus with the face on front of it) is rarely full when you get on, when you use it, you'll know what I'm talking about. The maids were fantastic too I must say, the room was kept to a very high standard, bear in mind we were there for 3 weeks and not one day of the stay did we have any complaints with the cleaning - this must say something. Room wise, the bathroom was on the modest size with a shower only, but come on, when you're in Florida, you're not there to spend hours in the bathroom anyway. Sufficient enough to do the job and clean. The breakfast area was on the small side, again nothing which bothered us as we didn't use it. To first time Orlando travellers, if you're using the complimentary shuttle service to parks, but want to come home sooner, you can. The Lynx bus stops outside the hotel! Lynx busses run from Disney and Universal, so if you don't hire a car like we didn't, all is not lost. We tended to find that the shuttles were very limited, so do your homework before you go so you're prepared. I would also advise anyone to take their own food to the parks, we didn't for the first week, and spent an absolute fortune! There is a Subway 2 seconds away from the hotel, so we were buying food from here and taking it with us - saved us an absolute fortune! Another tip too, when you get to the parks, it's cheaper to drink fizzy drinks than water... What I did was buy one of the refillable cups, but only got it filled with ice, then used a water fountain to fill the rest up. This is something else which saved us a fortune, which gave us money for more things, ie HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS!!! =) We walked to Seaworld everyday we went which was fab. You must also try the Village Inn restuaraunt next door, this was our first taste to American food, and it just got better from there! My fiancee proposed to me whilst in Disneyland, when we got back we were cream crackered, so went to the Village Inn for the millionth time lol, when we told them, we got our meal for free! How's that for hospitality?! Oh, and another really helpful hint if you're going to stay here - don't use the dry cleaning! Well, you can, but you will pay quite a lot for it (respectively). After we paid for our dry cleaning, we noticed a self service washing area on the second floor - gutted! In all fairness we weren't told about this, but we didn't ask either, so no-one is to blame. But at least my fellow travellers know this now after reading this essay ;) Buy ALL your park tickets before you go - they will NOT be cheaper out there, but you will see a lot of stands offering cheap tickets, believe me, we looked at them all out of interest, but none were actually cheaper. The hotel let us check out later as our flight back to Manchester wasn't until 6:30 - we really appreciated this.

And WHAT a bargain it was! Everything was perfect. The room was cleaned to a very high standard every day. The soundproofing and blackout curtains were superb. We never really heard anything or were kept awake by the floodlit car park. The staff were very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. The daytime front desk member of staff gave us some great tips for Disney. There is a free shuttle bus that leaves every day for the parks, twice for Epcot, with 8.10 and 10.40am drop off with return at 6.40 or 10pm - usually enough time to see the fireworks at the Magic Kingdom and make a run for it to get back. The drivers were great and were on time. You can see SeaWorld from the upper rooms, but ironically we never went there on this occasion. This was our first holiday in Florida using public transport exclusively. Car hire and even taxis were out of the question. With this hotel, you simply don't need to hire a car. From Terminal A at MCO, head towards the local bus stops just outside on the far right hand side as you exit from ground level. They cost just $2 and you get dropped off across the street from the hotel. The 111 Lynx service is quicker, taking around 30 minutes and the 42 took a much longer hour and a half. Stupidly, the buses aren't really designed for carrying luggage but the services we used were quiet enough to not deprive anyone of a seat. The drivers and fellow travellers were really helpful and friendly. I'd say even more so than the i-Ride Trolley (you can buy day/week passes from the hotel reception). This also stops outside the hotel. When the i-Ride had problems during one day of our stay, we just hopped on the Lynx to get back to the hotel from International Drive. The room itself was big with complimentary toiletries, coffee maker, plenty of towels, cable TV with HBO and a wired LAN connection for computers (cable thoughtfully provided). There is no Wi-Fi in the rooms, only at reception. It's not very quick to be honest and did struggle with lots of people using it, but better than data roaming costs. There is a complimentary buffet style breakfast every morning. Toast, muffins, coffee, cereal, pastries, fruit cocktail and porridge. It was always really busy, finding a seat inside when the seating ran out was the only real issue we had. But you could at least sit outside. I regret not asking for a fridge in the room, but the ice makers made up for it to an extent. We used the washing & drying machines which cost $2 for each and helped us travel light. Our dining out options were largely the Village Inn next door, which was great and Flippers Pizzeria. For snacks and booze we used the petrol station and the liquor store. All are about a safe 5 minutes walk away The reception staff say that the hotel is about to change to a Best Western, so it will be interesting to see what happens to it.

After a bad experience at a local hotel a few years ago, I had been driving home; very tired and turning around to go back to close to where I was the next morning. This year, I started searching again and came across this hotel. I certainly didn't expect much and perhaps that's why I was pleasantly surprised. I arrived at the hotel about 2pm on Sunday and my room was ready. First floor (as requested). The room had 2 beds, a desk, a safe and a tv with good reception. I turned the a/c up and had no problem with it when I returned many hours later. Neither that night (I got back about 1am) nor the next morning (up about 7am) did I hear the sound of children running down the halls (as happens in many Disney resorts). It was quiet. People closed their doors quietly insead of letting them slam shut. The continental breakfast was as advertised and more than plenty for even a picky person like me. There were 3 kinds of cerals (I had cornflakes) and a number of muffins, bagels and doughnuts (had a choc chip muffin). There were juices and coffee (I had milk). From what I saw, the pool was very small, but I liked that all the doors were locked at 11pm and you had to have the desk clerk buzz you in, as well as inside entrances. As a woman travelling alone, I preferred that extra security. My only complaint is if I had to have spent more time there, the poor set up of the sink outside the bathroom and the way the bathroom door was would have driven me nut. But, for the price I paid and everything the hotel had to offer, I couldn't have been happier. If you're in town for a short time or you're a local who plans a late night at City Walk/Uni or Sea World and don't want to drive home, I'd have no problem recommending this establishment. Received a fantastic rate at Hotels.com. No problem checking in (staff were pleasant and polite). The room was clean and I felt safe.

The double rooms had very large beds in and one bed was big enough for 2 of you to sleep in. The rooms all had safes ans air conditioning, a coffee maker and an iron/ironing board. The TV had numerous channels and was great for watching when you had an early night or morning off the parks. There is a laundry with washer and dryer and they have a supply of washing powder and fabric conditioner you can buy. There is no fridge in the rooms which you may expect with the usual mini bar, but there are vending machines for non-alcoholic drinks and snacks. The pool was fine for a quick dip.

There is also a great diner next door - Tim the waiter is a favourite for this family. There is a store and a subway within 5 mins as well as both Indian and Italian restaurants/takeaways, though they are dearer than the diner. The negatives - the breakfast is very limited, cereal, muffins, danish, juice, toast, tea and coffee. There is no cooked breakfast but I am a veggie and that doesn't bother me. It can also get a bit crowded in the breakfast room as there are only about a dozen tables and not much space to move, it is basically a part of reception and not a separate room, the coffee is available all day though.

The hotel was fine- the beds and pillows were comfortable and the A/C was cold, the room was clean and the front desk was helpful. I did have one complaint with my request for a taxi for our early AM departure to the airport. The next morning when I arrived in the lobby the front desk had set us up with a Lincoln Towncar, NOT a taxi like we had arranged. That is the service they have some arrangement with. I ended up paying more since I wasn't about to send him away and wait for another ride at 4AM. Also the water in the rooms does smell like sulfer. I bought a gallon of water from the overpriced gas station next door for drinking. We did benefit from the public buses, they stop right in front of the hotel. It's inexpensive but you do put in your time waiting, 1/2 hr seemed average without a bench at many stops. The drivers were very friendly assisting us with directions to the malls, etc. We even took the bus from the airport as we arrived early and the room wasn't near ready so for $3 bus fare we avoided a $45 taxi ride! A warning to all, do not order food from the pamphlets slipped under your room door! It's understood that this is a scheme to get your credit card #, also they said the pizza's are probably made in someone's garage or worse! That's if they even deliver the food. Sad, huh? They warned us on the TV, the tourist channel there, but for those who don't hear about it ,yikes! One last thing, we did the walk from Seaworld after the park closed rather than getting the shuttle so early. The path leads you down a dark, scary side street with a vacant lot next to it. a lot of overgrowth and a perfect place in my opinion for trouble. We joined up with another family and were able to cut through thier gated hotel parking lot to avoid that , I woudn't have been comfortable otherwise and do not recommend that route. We loved HP World at Universal and aslo Seaworld, the all inclusive meal deals were also a good deal to look into while your there. We also did Wet and wild, FUN! And Aquatica-not fun! We had the Flex pass so we tried it but left that place early as they had reached capacity and it was insane! Not one place to sit and the lines were sooo long!

She went to the front desk and inquired and the lady working the desk didn't even bother looking up from the computer and told her that they didn't have them. She made no effort to look at all. The next morning I went to the front desk and inquired with different staff and when I described them they pulled the shoes out immediately without having to look - which was great. I would stay here again as the price and location was right. I would just bring my own peanut butter :)", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cWalking distance to SeaWorld but that's all it has going for it\u201d", "Author": "Jason69850", "ReviewID": "UR31075504", "Content": "I'm not a hotel snob. I like the Best Western/Comfort Inn type of hotels. I wasn't expecting the Ritz for $59 a night - I really wasn't, but this hotel was below my expectations. It is walking distance to Seaworld which is good since there was only one shuttle a day. However, it's a long walk and while it was fine for 2 adult men to walk through parking lots and across busy streets, I would not recommend that you could do it with children. Judging from the strip mall adjacent to the hotel, this is a rather sketchy part of Orlando, and even though I'm 6'1 200lbs, I didn't feel entirely safe walking around it day or night. The hotel itself is rather sad. The room we had was tiny, noisy and rather old. The modling on the shower (there is no bathtub just a shower) was chipped rather badly exposing the plaster. You can hear the hallway noise very distinctly and since it's a hotel near a theme park, that means that you can hear kids screaming down the halls day and night. The free breakfast is a joke. It's in a tiny alcover off the front desk and there is no room to even get a muffin or a juice since it's always filled to 500% capacity so you can't even reach the food. The other \"amenity\" is even worse - free internet. Don't assume it's free wireless like most modern hotels, it's a very short ethernet cable so you are forced to use the internet in a very uncomfortable rickety old chair. We were there 3 nights and said internet was down (With a green apology screen) about half the time. The front desk staff were a little curt at times, and not overly friendly (and I wasn't asking for anything other than directions). Probably the worst part about it was the smell of the room. IT had an awful smell of some chemical, maybe bug repellent? that was overpowering whenever you walked in the room. During the days, the maids would turn off the air conditioner so that made it even worse when we returned. There are so many hotels along internation drive. For the same price, the Best Western Movieland or Clarion Universal are 1000% nicer. We wanted to get to Sea World and Discovery Cove very early so we thought it would be nice to stay here, but we would never stay here again. and would advise you to stay further down international drive and take the shuttles. You're sort of trapped here. There is a Village Inn restaurant next door and a strip mall, but it looks very much like the worst neighborhood of an inner city and like I said, I was anxious walking around the area which does look like the worst parts of an inner city and since the hotel itself has no food to speak of, I don't see how/where you would eat on an extended stay here.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cDon't ask for anything at the front desk\u201d", "Author": "Littlefootann", "ReviewID": "UR30652273", "Content": "This hotel was average.

The hotel looks nice from the outside and I could see ample free car parking as I entered the hotel via the Mears shuttle service that I had booked online (by the way, Mears shuttle is a good, efficient and reliable service that I would recommend). The reception staff were friendly. I arrived at 1 pm and requested for an early check-in and they obliged me. All through my stay, I found the reception staff very pleasant and helpful. The room was airconditioned, with an iron and a telephone. Local calls are free. The room decor was nice and the room was fair sized (unlike some of the European hotels I have been to). The rooms have been recently renovated as they looked new. Overall the hotel was neat and clean. I liked the rooms. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. There is free WiFi internet all over the hotel. There are also 3 computers for use by hotel guests (free). The free breakfast had muffins, coffee, toast and juice - quality was just about average and this was the only disappointing part of the stay - but the breakfast was free and filled your tummy! There is a free shuttle service to DisneyWorld (the shuttle bus drops you off at Epcot Center and you can then use the free disney monorail or free disney buses to go to the other disney theme parks from there) and SeaWorld. The bus is small and on some occassions, many people had to stand in the bus - but the bus was reliable. At a 2 minutes walk from the hotel is SUBWAY sandwiches. At a 12 mins walk is McDonalds (1 stop away by the I-ride trolley). If you do need to shop at a convenience store, do not use the one next to SUBWAY as its expensive and hardly has a range of products. Take the I-ride trolley and get to a Walgreens store and do your purchases.

Staff was helpful and pleasant. We did not find the hotel noisy at all, kids enjoyed the small swimming pool. Negatives: We are non smokers and I chose the hotel because it was non smoking. There were filled overflowing containers for cigarette butts next to every entry door. It just made the hotel feel icky to me. (On the plus side there was no smell of smoke inside the hotel.) The room was very small, very basic, and felt humid. We did walk to Seaworld as recommended by another reviewer. I would not walk with young children and not during the hot summer months.

They have three computers you can use for free-one sit down in the lobby and two stand up in a balcony on the 2nd floor.
