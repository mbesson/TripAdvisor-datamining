This is not a tourist place and dont promote this place as it. Its a transit hotel with a good location. Near mrt so easy to reach from the airport, 15 minutes by walk from orchard and the walk is in interesting since you will discover the university of art and other i terting things. You cannot get lost the way is really easy. You are near little india too. The other good thing you have near by a 7/11 and restaurants open 24 hours. Regarding the hotel i didnt expect much but at least you can get some sleep or rest after a busy day. You can hear everything from your room you hear people walking in the corridor and the other rooms on the same floor. I didnt find any sleep at all since this hotel even at 3 o'clock since to be busy by short stays guest \"guy with girls.\" The room was small 20 sqm, the shower with the toilet but good point hot water but no pressure. They provide free internet that i needed this one reason i stay there coz in singapore they charge crazy prices for internet. So free internet is good when its working! It was working but u need to setup the password every twenty minutes. So annoying. I didnt upload any pictures since you got all already here. So please dont stop there for tourism, for one night transit its ok.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Linz, Austria", "Title": "\u201cTHIS IS NOT A HOTEL FOR TOURISTS\u201d", "Author": "Siglo5", "ReviewID": "UR125644119", "Content": "We`ve stayed in this Hotel for two nights without sleep.
