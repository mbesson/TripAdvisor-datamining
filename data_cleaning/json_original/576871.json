Moreover, the service is excellent: the cleaning was timely and, the staff were accomodating to special requests.There is little more one could ask for in a hotel, really. So if you're going to Tres Cantos, or if you're going to Madrid and don't mind the Cercan\u00ecas trip, stay here. The only drawbacks I would say are 1. the breakfast, while nice, is not as good as the VP Jard\u00ecn nearby--the meats are poorer quality, bread is factory made and cereals are from the box; 2. the details about requirements for the spa were not provided in the room, and one of these was that a swimcap is required--kind of annoying to have to keep buying swimcaps.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ire", "Title": "\u201cit was ok just for 4 nights\u201d", "Author": "ivan b", "ReviewID": "UR129034230", "Content": "i stead here with a coupe of friends mid march, the hotel surrounding are very boring , you would have to get a bus or taxi to where you have to go . our room had ants in it and to the other guests that were staying there too i heard the same thing. the rooms were big and the bathroom was very nice.

The room (207) was large and very spacious although the bed was only a 4\u20196\u201d size. When returning to my room each night, after an evening out, I found my sheets turned back with a small box of two chocolates placed on the pillow. Breakfast was nothing special \u2013 the usual continental buffet (fruit, cheese, cold meat, boxes of cereal) and scrambled eggs and bacon. The coffee machine was daunting, with all the options in Spanish, but once you realized that it only dispensed black coffee and the options just determined the amount and strength that was dispensed (with a separate milk dispenser to the side), it wasn\u2019t too bad. My only gripe is that although you are paying 90 euros a night to stay there, they want to charge you an extra 10 euros a day to use the swimming pool, and if you haven\u2019t got a swimming cap (which is necessary in Spain when swimming in indoor pools), that\u2019s another 6 euros!", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cFAB HOTEL BUT HAUNTED\u201d", "Author": "maz18", "ReviewID": "UR16440190", "Content": "I have just returned from a stay at the hotel, my first impression was fab hotel, friendly staff, everything you could wish for!

Firstly i lay down in the bed and felt this person pressing on my shoulder and then things stayed to happen, There was foot steps in the bathroom, a black cloak floated passed me,Tapping and knocking on the head board and then a person in the corner in an metal outfit, I thought i was imagining it but there was 2 of us in the room and we were both feeling such a strong aura! What freaked us out most was the safe buttons started to move, you could here this quite clearly and thats when we got really scared! We packed up in such a hurry and ran out of room 121 but just as i closed the door, someone pushed me from behind, 2 pushes and i got such a shock that i got so upset, It was like as if some one was throwing you out of a nite club! We ran down stairs and tries to explain what had happened, they were surprised to see us as they properly thought we were mad leaving during the nite! They said that there was no one in either side of us in bedrooms! Its like when you et a fierce force or shivers all over your body< The hotel was amazing but if we had stayed in the room any longer, something bad would have happened! This is a genuine report!

Only downside was the heat in the room - air con was set at 19C and despite asking 3 times to turn it down as the control box in the room had no effect, it stayed at 19 - our room overlooked the dual carriageway and it was too noisy to leave the balcony door open. Local bars and restaurants are 5-10 minutes walk as is the station. \u20ac3.15 gets a day return into the middle of Madrid and we found it really handy.
