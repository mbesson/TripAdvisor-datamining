The entrance staircase stank of damp and mould and the untidy girl who opened the door led me to a junk filled 'reception' room, little more than a filthy cupboard, to check in. The carpets were threadbare and stained and the corridor looked as if it had been painted by a chimpanzee. My room smelt of drains, the toilet seat was loose and there was mould in the bathroom. Much worse, and dangerous, was the bedside light with its bare wires. The window had been wedged open, and when I asked about it, the reply was 'oh, we needed to get some air in there'. (I was not surprised - the place stank). I was worried for my safety as there was a fire escape directly outside, but she told me they had 'never had any trouble'. Er - this is London - I do not exactly feel safe in such a dump as this with a window I cannot shut. Breakfast was served, late, in the derelict pub, by a rude young girl who could not be bothered to hurry a yard. There was no heating, the place was covered in dust and I did not want to touch anything, so I walked out. Later, I went to get my luggage to move to another hotel and by 4.30pm, the room still had not been cleaned. A filthy rat-hole of a place with poor service.

One post would say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the rooms were filthy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while the very next insisted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least everything was spotlessly clean.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my take, and yes, it is a positive review, you just have to keep reading: My group booked three rooms for three nights. We ended up only staying for one as some of the inconveniences were too difficult for us. We knew that it was a multi-story hotel with no elevator and so requested rooms on the lower floors. We received two rooms on the second and one on the third, which was much what we expected. Nicola, the woman who seems to run the place almost single-handedly, was a gem and actually handled the bulk of carrying our bags to our rooms as we were (a) tired and (b) stereotypical Americans who are unused to stairs much less stairs when encumbered with 50 pound suitcases. The whole place is a bit careworn, with bald spots on the carpets and peeling wallpaper. However, that can easily be dismissed (by most) as charming. My main worry, from the reviews I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read, was cleanliness. There were things that could have been cleaner (door jambs, light switches, windows) but the things that matter most to me (shower, toilet, bedding) were immaculate. Nicola was always there and eager to do anything to make her guests happy. While waiting for our rooms to be cleaned, we adjourned to the first floor pub which has also seen better days and seems to be held together with duct tape. However, the bartender, whose name I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch, was every bit as solicitous as Nicola, and instantly made the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they want ice with everything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd connection. We checked out early mainly because of difficulties with communication. Our cell phones didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work there and we were unable to make the in-room phones work for us so coordinating things was a bit tough. (One of our rooms had a toilet that needed a secret code to flush but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another story.) We ended up finding a hotel down the street that had wifi and a restaurant and was better suited to our needs but for the traveler who is a bit more adventurous, more self-sufficient, this hotel is a low-price, clean where it counts, customer service oriented find. I especially loved the fact that when we told Nicola we were checking out early, she never asked why, just checked us out with a smile, picked up a suitcase and started down the stairs before thanking us and wishing us a safe journey.

The staff is nice, if really busy. The rooms are sufficiently clean, and the amenities sufficient. The common spaces are pretty run down, and the decor mismatching, but it's a solid deal. The breakfast isn't what they make it out to be, however, so if you're looking for a good English breakfast (more than toast and cereal--and trust me, you want eggs, beans and mushrooms while you're in the UK!), you'll need to head down the street.
