It got worse, they only occasionally make up the rooms, we had it done once in 5 days, by day three we had no towels and no TOILET PAPER! trying to secure some required a complex and rather R18 version of charades due to the language barrier. But it got worse, they spend every night renovating until at least one am, jack hammers and nail guns on the floor we were on. To be honest I could go on all day, the truth is we are young and cheap and don't mind most things but the basics are missing here and the uneasy stares in the lobby even creeped me out a 24yr old guy.

There is nothing to complain about this hotel. Hotels in istanbul is overpriced and if you are looking for a nice and cozy sleep in a budget with own ensuite, then this is the one . This small hotel is just 5 minutes walk from Sultanahmet tram stop, although you need to do a bit of searching before you can locate it. The stairs leading to the hotel is a bit doggy, a small reception area and an even smaller room . Our twin room on the third floor is very small but clean , just have enough room to manuvoure and the bathroom is even worst, hardly any room even for Asians. But if you are looking to stay Sultanahmet area and don't want to pay more then this is the choice. The owner, Deniz is very friendly and breakfast was served on the terrace overlooking the Bosphorus with hotly cook omellete. A plus in Turkey.

On arrival in spite of having paid up front a month in advance I was told there was no room avavilable for me so I was taken to a supposedly same standard hotel around the corner. It was not the same standard and i turned down all the three rooms I was offered. Returning to the Meddusa i was told to come back in an hour and spent an anxious time wondering where i was going to stay. On my return I was given room 101. This room had no view apart from the yard of the next door building. There was intermittent noise from some sort of ventilation system. There was no way of turning on the remote control. I asked and was eventually given a remote control. When you opened the door to the landing you were immediately hit by the smell of smoke from the lobby. On the plus side the location is excellent and the room clean. the view from the roof terrace was good., and the breakfast adequate. i did not find the staff friendly and in fact found them quite intimidating.
