This time was much worse, and will be my last. The rooms are small, but I think theyre fine for 1 or 2 people. It's New York, so you're unlikely to be in your room much anyway. They are also very clean. I will give them that. There is a station which shows XXX content on it in each room. Id suggest parents with kids be careful about this. I cant remember the channel name, sorry. There is free wi-fi in the room, which is good. However, sometimes it's fast and sometimes it's very slow. There are public 3 computers and 1 printer available to use for a small fee. Also, my mobile phone and no signal in my room. I was on the first floor so maybe thats it? It was aggravating whatever the reason. The bed wasnt very soft, quite firm in my opinion. So, depending on how you like your bed to be, this can be good or bad. The AC/heat in the room was VERY, VERY loud. I couldnt turn it on at night to sleep. Therefore, when I woke up it was cold in my room. One of the worst things about this place is the shower. It gets very cold all of a sudden....then you get scalded. I like a good, warm shower that stays warm for 10 mins or less. This was AWFUL. The walls are very thin, so if you're a light sleeper like I am. BEWARE. I couldnt sleep well at night. A poor nights sleep really wears on you when you're running all around the city. The staff are unfriendly and act like they'd prefer if you werent there. My bathroom had a leak dropping from the overhead vent. It soaked the floor. I went to the front desk to ask if I could change my room. He acted like it made him angry to have to deal with this. He said he'd send someone to fix it. Why couldnt I just get a different room with a dry floor? The guy came, said \"It's because the people above you were taking a shower. It will stop in 5 mins. Keep the towels on the floor and where it's dropping.\" He gave me clean towels and left. It did stop dripping but the floor remained wet 'til I checked out the next day. This is HORRIBLE customer service regardless if you're a budget hotel or not. I'd suggest that you spend $50.00 more a night and actually have an enjoyable place to stay.

I have stayed at the Belnord twice. Just a block from the Subway #1 train on Broadway. Upper West Side, lovely brownstone street, tree lined, and CLEAN beautifully kept Victoria charm, with a modern cleanup. The rooms are spotless and smell clean. New lamenant flooring, New shower stalls and windows. Nice bedding a doored closet and television. I must warn you, this is the smallest room I have ever had, the bathroom small as well, but with a window. My room faced a courtyard and was So Quiet is was like I was living in the country. Trees out the window and birds singing how about that for NYC. Amsterdam Ave. on the end of the street, with the BEST DELI called \"Barney Greengrass\", I have since got to be familiar and a regular customer there while in NYC. I buy all the waiters socks in addition to their tips, ( they are on their feet all day) and they remember me. I love the neighbourhood. The hotel has a grand entrance all in white and gold and makes you feel very special. The dark wood and timeless antiques in the lobby are not haunting dingy and dusty, Everything shines. The elevator is smooth. There is a desk with lots of tour information and phamplets and great city maps. An attendant on duty 24-7. They are very secure and monitered. And helpful. I requested extra towels, and they were delivered right away, white, fluffy , new, and warm just out of a dryer, imagine that as well! I must say the Spanish maids were VERY noisey in the early mornings in the hallways. Yelling to each other while cleaning the rooms. I complained about that and they switched the attendant to Spanish men who were very professional and gracious. ( I think those guys understood what I meant :) I do tend to need a bigger space in the room, so I have moved on from the Belnord, but I was pleasantly surprised, and felt that I was staying in someones historical home, that they preserved and cared for in an updated and professional way. It again did not have the feeling of a flashback to a museum of dust and darkness, you can tell right away, this had been upgrading to the current times. I admired that.

They lost our reservation for the second leg of the trip and were patronising, unhelpful and contemptuous. They would claim that 'your reservation is not on the system' and repeatedly ask, \"What website did you book it on?\", and when we couldn't immediately remember they repeated themselves as though we were slow 3-year-olds.

The staff is friendly and it is easy to park your car in front of the hotel (but you have to remove it at 10am or it will be towed, at 12, you can park again). I had tested 2 rooms, a large one for $240/ night. This one was awful, located at the first floor, it was close to the Ice making machine and the permanent noise was so loud that it was very hard to sleep. Also the smell was disgusting, apparently someone smoked and they compensated with a lot of refresher, the mix was disgusting. The AC was not working and we had a very warm week just after a very cold winter. I was driving from Florida and the mix of smell, the hi-price and the AC would have deserved a 0 * in all count. Hopefully I changed the room to a less expensive one ($120/night) for the next 7 days. This second room was facing the back alley with dark buildings just in front of you. The room was so small that you had to jump over the bed to go from one side to the other side. It was very clean, and the bathroom was nice, I took baths and the water, soap and towel were all spotless. The AC was not work either, so I suspect that the temperature is mainly controlled form the hotel generator, and because the weather was exceptionally warm, the AC was heating whatever setting you were trying. They gently proposed to move again to another room but I stayed. Noise : the hotel is tiny, so are the corridors, the rooms and the walls, if you happen to have noisy people in the adjacent room, you feel like if you are in their room. One night I got a dunk couple who had an argument, I had to wait until they stopped to be able to sleep. Internet : they have a good Wifi, they change the password every night, it is free. Location : Excellent location, close to shops, 10 min walk from Center Park, 5 min from metro, it is the perfect spot for visiting NY.

Or worse, were they hoping for a 10th story balcony and a view of central park for $75? Please, don't go to a bargain hotel expecting free breakfast, a Ritz Carleton sized room, a glitzy view and free parking. I actually felt like a real New Yorker with my view of that other brick building because there was a pigeon sitting on the sill and it was unique.

Our bathroom was new and spotlessly clean, though tiny, like everything else in this hotel. If you want a bath, you will have to sit with your knees bent. The shower, however, was nice. The sheets were clean. The maid service was nice and friendly, though we were given only one wash cloth daily, sometimes none, and our plastic glasses were not replenished. The room was about 9 feet by 10 or 11 feet, which included the closet and bathroom. The double bed was very small, and the pillows were about an inch thick. Everything in the room was of cheap quality. There was one bedside table and a small desk, both of pressed wood with some of the veneer chipped off. There was one straight-backed wooden chair with a filthy stained seat cover. The carpeting was filthy and stained; the wallpaper was hanging loose in a couple places around the window. There was a plastic zip-up mattress cover on the mattress, for which I was grateful, knowing that is a way to help prevent bed bugs. Outside air came right in around the window air-conditioner, though it did not matter to us in March because the room was warm enough to sleep in. When we turned on the heat briefly, the clanging in the pipes was loud and quite amusing. It wouldn't be amusing, though, if you actually needed heat and had to leave it on. The halls are very narrow; if you stick out your elbows, they will touch each wall ( and I am only 5'4\") - but who cares how wide the halls are? If you are obese, or very tall, you will not be comfortable here, however. So why would one stay at the Belnord? Amazingly, $150/night is cheap in NYC, especially for this area. The location is wonderful, my favorite area in NYC. There are scores of good cafes and restaurants on Broadway and more on Amsterdam, between which this hotel is located. It is close to subway stations, the Natural History museum, Central Park, Zabars. We spent some time in the Barnes and Noble nearby and found the entertainment for the evening was a group of Times Square actors reading parts from short plays. We were eating in a small local restaurant with great inexpensive food when Jerry Stiller came in and sat down for dinner (George Costanza's dad on Seinfeld and actor Ben Stiller's real-life dad).

Down the hall, another tenant was blasting techno music and occasionally strolling down the hall barefoot-flashbacks to my freshman dorm room. Clearly this guy was living here. Then I went to the bathroom. I am very petite and the toilet was facing the wall with about an inch of space between the toilet and the wall. I had trouble squeezing into that space, so I can't imagine how anyone else manages. Also, there was no soap or towel in the restroom, meaning that everyone else there is NOT WASHING THEIR HANDS after using the facilities. YUCK. After about 20 minutes, we called my brother (who lives in Brooklyn) to come meet us. He apparently went up the other staircase, which led him to some creepy torn down area of the building that was reminiscent of \"The Shining.\" Also, it was comforting to know that someone without a room key could stroll in the hotel and hang out on the floors-and even use the bathrooms! (Attention New Yorkers: Here is a public restroom alternative to McDonald's!!!)Top-notch security in place. I tried to show my brother the tiny weird bathroom (it was adjacent to my room and any noises in there could be heard very clearly). I pressed the door, which was unlatched, and someone was INSIDE and slammed it shut!! Who goes to the bathroom without closing the door or locking it??? In a hotel with shared bathrooms?? And you know he didn't wash his hands afterwards!! This hotel was all kinds of creepy and uncomfortable. I cannot stress enough the absurdity of requiring a/c in FREEZING COLD TEMPERATURES!!! I felt like I was being smothered with a hot blanket. YUCK. DO NOT STAY IN THIS TINY PIECE OF HELL. ENROLL IN COLLEGE AND LIVE IN A DORM ROOM INSTEAD.

The two men who were in the reception gave us a bad first impression. They felt very unprofessional and kept making mistakes and apologizing. Our room was on the 4th floor and it was tiny!! I don't mind really, but when there might be bed bugs it doesn't sound at all appealing. The one huge plus was that the bathroom was right next to us and it was clean most of the time (unless the guys opposite the bathroom had already taken a shower, then it was dirty...). For the first three nights we slept with the lights off, then when on the third morning I found one tiny bedbug and killed it, we slept the rest of the nights (11!!) with the lights on. We found one bed bug after that but had no bites anywhere. When we got home, my husband had some in his waist and I found two in my leg. But that was all. I covered myself up pretty well and used this bug protection liquid on my skin. hehe. It smelled funny in the room and the air conditioner made a huge noise. When we were checking out, they made us pay $5/BAG (!!!!!!) to keep in the luggage room!!!!! So in total we had to pay $20!!!!! That was insane. I felt the people in the reception were always unprofessional and felt to me like they didn't know how to help and made me feel like I was dumb even asking.

A good rule of thumb that I found was fairly accurate was the number of stars a hotel claims to be, add two zero's onto the end of that to get your minimum nightly stay (ie: 2.5 stars = $250 per night). That's how it worked for us ... anyway, I found the Belnord through tripadvisor and ended up booking 5 nights there. A little about The Belnord hotel: to keep cost down, don't get the bathroom in your room, you get 4 bathrooms per floor of about +/- 10 rooms each. There is no elevator and smaller hallways. The room we had was roughly 8' x 12', enough for one double bed, a nightstand and not much walking room. The pillows were flat and bed was pretty hard. We packed a third suitcase with extra pillows and an extra sheet. We had ZERO problems with bugs as others claim. Bathrooms were very clean, no problems with waiting for others to get out. We paid $115 a night. We only slept in the room, our days and evenings were spent adventuring all over Manhattan. We flew into La Guardia airport, closest (and probably cheapest) to Manhattan. It was a $30 cab ride (incl. tolls & tip) from the airport to the Upper West Side where this hotel is. After you pick up luggage, DO NOT GO WITH THE PEOPLE TRYING TO SELL YOU THE SHARED RIDE OR DIRECT TRIP. They quoted us $55 plus tolls (we went through one toll, $4.50 I believe). We found a line that about 10-15 others were standing in and there was a guy hailing cabs for us - hence the $30 cab ride. The Belnord is one block from the subway, get a pocket map of the subway system and manhattan, it'll be your best friend. If you are there for 4 or more nights/days buy the unlimited subway pass for $24. It is $2 per person per ride no matter how far you ride on the subway. Good rule of thumb to begin at is you'll need to go atleast twice a day on it, from and to the hotel. We made the mistake of thinking we wouldn't use it as much as we did ... we're going to get the unlimited next time. You might be able to get away with getting one card and sharing it ... For Dave Letterman or Conan tickets, which are free, the further in advance you can try and request dates for, do it. At the beginning of October, for example, Conan was booked out until mid/late November. Although you can get standby tickets. Get to the NBC Studios Rainbow Room (outside, underneath the sign, on the Today show side) at around 7:30ish (in the morning) for the standby handout at 9:00am to have an excellent shot of seeing his show. For Letterman, you request online and they call you prior to the requested date, otherwise he has standy tix too. SNL tix get about 100,000 requests per year and they can only satisfy 8000 of them per season. Standby tickets for those get handed out on Saturday morning but people get in line on Friday early afternoon. If you like the Today show you can get there about 6:30am and have an another awesome chance of being right up against the gate they put up. We made it on national TV! For the Letterman fans, we went to Hello Deli and ate lunch there and also met Rupert! Nice guy! Good lunch too. There are so many restaurants to choose from it is crazy. We are in our mid-twenties and we liked Greenwich Village the best. It is trendier, more active and offers local night life as compared to touristy nightlife, lots of good restaurants and quite a few bars. John's pizza just by Times Square off Broadway to the East is very good pizza. Ask any local in/around Times Square and they should be able to tell you where it is at exactly. I'd definately recommend this: we bought for $77 a piece a guided tour of Lower Manhattan, Upper Manhattan on a double decker bus. Be forewarned, bring some ones for a tip to the tour guide/driver, especially if they have done a great job. This was on the red bus, there is also a blue bus that does the same thing. Included in our $77 was also tickets to the Empire State Building observation deck and the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. We saved about $10 pp doing that. This was good for 2 full days but they signed it for an additional day for us.

When I asked to just give me another room they told me \"sorry, we're sold out.\" Thankfully my colleague had friends in the city who he called and stayed with and I got the joy of staying at the Belnord. As I walked up the stairs to my room I noticed the domestic dispute between the couple across the hall which was heard all night through both doors. After making myself comfortable in the box they consider a room I called the front desk to order a wake up call because there was no clock/alarm in the room. I noted that the bathroom was so small that sitting on the toilet your shoulder touches the wall and the other sholder is hanging over the tub (I'm not a big guy either; 5-11 180lbs.)

We didn't want to spend a lot, and I was thrilled to find the Belnord which looked nice and was in a good neighborhood AND less than $100/night, including tax! I booked it, and THEN I read the reviews. Bedbugs, tiny rooms, shared bathrooms. We didn't care that the room was tiny, because lets face it: we didn't come to NYC to sit around our room. The shared bathroom we weren't that concerned about either because we figured we were only gone one night, and if it was really nasty, we'd just wait until we got home the next night to take showers. The bedbug reviews, however, totally freaked me out. I knew I couldn't cancel my reservation, and I knew we couldn't afford any other hotels in decent neighborhoods. My friend's mom made her read 2 articles and watch a video on bedbugs and GAVE HER A QUIZ before we left! She is so funny. I was feeling okay, though, because I had read other reviews about the Belnord that said other people had read the bedbug reviews after booking, had been really freaked out, but had no problems whatsoever. I relaxed. THEN we got to the hotel. It was too early to check in, but the nice guy behind the desk let us leave our luggage in a luggage room while we spent some time sightseeing. While we were at the desk, a girl about our age was checking out of the hotel and said \"You might want to look into that room, because I woke up with these bites all over me! Look, I have like 40 bites and I itch like crazy! There's definitely something in that room!\" We flipped out. We listened to her say her room number, which was 170-something. We made a mental note in case they tried to give us that room. While we were sightseeing, we tried to come up with a plan. Sleep in bugspray? A scuba suit? Find a dog that was sick with a fever and let it sleep with us, since bedbugs seek out the warmest body??? When we checked in, they did not give us that room. My friend knew what to look for, so as soon as we got to the (tiny) room, we tore it apart. The room was 10 feet by 7 feet, no lie. We didn't care, though, as I said. There was a plastic, zippered matress cover. We undid it and examined the seems for evidence of bedbugs. We took the headboard off the wall because that is another place bedbugs hide during the day. At the Belnord, you can lift the headboard and it comes off easily. No evidence there. We were reassured. The next time we were in the lobby, I said to the desk boy:\"Remember that girl who checked out ealier and complained of bedbugs? Do you get that a lot? You can be honest, because I've already paid.\" He got very flustered and said \"I don't know what to say! Maybe she just made that up to get a discount. If you have any problems with your room, we are here 24 hours a day and we will move you, no questions asked.\" Although it was a little hard to sleep, knowing that there are bedbugs in the hotel, even if not in my room (and because the AC unit scared the mess out of me and woke me up every time it kicked on), we had no problems at all, I am happy to say. BOTTOM LINE: Do your homework before you go. Know what to look for as far as bedbugs are concerned. KNow the signs. Move if you have ANY concerns. They will switch your room for you. I would stay at the Belnord again because it is in a safe area and very convenient to the subway--only one block away and it is very affordable. THe bathrooms were clean and always available. You can always ask for our room, 203-9, because you know at least that one doesn't have bedbugs!

We were on the 5th floor, no bugs at all, in fact the place was quite clean. I had not read the reviews prior to leaving or probably would have had the creeps! I stayed at a four star hotel in Boston last year, and three days later a five star hotel in Dallas, and came home with the itches described about bedbugs. Had no idea what was wrong with me, went to doctor, and found out. I did a lot of research on bedbugs after that, and now check when i check into a hotel. Did not have this problem. It is indeed a walk up so the flights of stairs are indeed good exercise (To get to floor 2, is 10 steps, turn, then 8), third floor (and every other floor (9 steps, turn then 8) ..yes I counted. Did not realize it was a walkup when I booked but I would have booked anyway. A staff member helped my fellow traveller with her suitcase. They do have a working ice machine---but you want to get a bag at reception, because you will not want to walk all the way up to the fifth floor to get the ice bucket, then down to fill it, then up again. The staff at the desk always accomodated us with a cellophane bag before we went upstairs. One block from 86th and Broadway subway station (did not know this when we first arrived and we took the Central Park West line and got off on 86th), a lot longer walk. Great 24 hour bread and bagel place around the corner. We went here for a fast and cheap vacation, since Jet Blue from Texas was 79 each way! We were amazed at how high hotels have gotten as it has been several years since I was in NY and used to be able to stay at the Days' Inn for 100-150, we found nothing below 250 when we internet searched several sites, so we took the Belnord at 99 for 4 nights and 79 for the last night (a Monday) Very small room (that's what I mean by european, it reminded me very much of the small rooms I have stayed in in Spain), tv worked, shared bathrooms really clean. They only give you two bath towels and one handtowel for two in a room. The maid one day stopped me and said \"propina\"...I have no idea what that meant...she took out a dollar bill and rubbed it together in her hand---i surmised she wanted a tip, which I would have left upon check out....but I figured she thought she could get it if she did that. I have never had anyone do that before, and I suppose you could play the same game as she did (don't understand the language), and ignore the request if you wanted to. She was attentive to our room, so it didn't really bother me to do it, just the request was a bit forward, i thought. One of the reception clerks was rude to one of the people I travelled with, but the rest were very professioanl and urbane. Professionally dressed, well groomed, and polite. I had no problems that way. I felt safe at this hotel, and slept incredibly well. I thought the acoustics were great. I heard there was a sick baby near us that was crying in the hall one night---I never heard a thing,a nd I was awake at the time that happened.

One block from the subway and very close to Central Park. We had a room with 2 beds and a private bath. We were on the first floor, so didn't have to lug our stuff up the stairs. I highly recommend getting a \"bigger and better\" room. The room was small, but met our needs easily. Had a window with a view and the heating system, TV worked fine. The room and bathroom were spotless and were kept that way each day. The shared bathrooms sparkled as well, and I never noticed a line. It seemed there were plenty of them. The staff was friendly and helpful and got everything we needed and included smiles and manners. Now what you REALLY want to know. The bedbugs. When we arrived on Friday we thoroughly examined the bed and room with no signs of the bugs. Each night when I'd happen to wake up, I would check the bed to make sure and no bugs. We were convinced that after staying three nights, there were no bugs, atleast in our room. That was until the last morning. When my mom got up from her bed, there sure enough was a bedbug! Talk about disappointing. Very creepy. Only glad that we hadn't seen this when we first got there-it would have been impossible to stay there had we known for sure. This review is hard to write, as I feel that for the price it is overall a great place to stay. It was really perfect for our needs. They just really need to get this bug problem under control.

Tick tock, it's about time to change that way of thinking at least when it comes to Belnord. I've stayed in dozens of hotels in USA and this is the worst I have come across. I'm not into luxury and usually am entertained what comes to problems with hotels- but Belnord makes even all the hotel comedy series look lame and definitely boring. The question is will you be ready to pay for this fun? I booked via ---- for six nights in January 2006 and paid in advance so there was a little risk of finding the hotel unbearable. Opening the room door convinced me already of troubles. After putting the lights on I lowered the window blinds just to find out they were not long enough to cover the long windows even if you tried adjusting them. There goes the privacy. The other window had been fixed with tape to keep it in place while the upper part of it had a broomstick put across to prevent opening it from the other side. There goes the safety. The view from the window included a tall brick wall and garbage containers. By this time I had also noticed the loud noise which reminded me of a truck parked right on the backyard with its motor running. The sound of traffic I can take but this sound of something much louder than any air conditioning system was very irritating. It stopped after the midnight but just for some hours. There goes the peace. Then came the cold. I come from Finland where temperatures go easily down to minus degrees but never in my life have I felt such an intense cold as in my room. The heating unit wouldn't work and when I explained the situation in the reception a spanish speaking man came to see about it. I tried telling him I've been working on the heater for hours but he said couldn't understand english at all. First he asked for ten minutes so I patiently waited for a miracle to happen. Then the man suddenly stood up claiming the AC unit was hot which it wasn't. For this simple word \"hot\" I had something to say back \"not hot or even warm\". The man looked careless about the whole thing and simply mumbled \"I'm sorry\". We walked back to the reception area but the hotel staff only wanted to hear what the man had to say- of which I didn't understand a word as it was all in spanish. I got an extra blanket- I almost caught a flu too on the following night. Six nights- such a long time when returning to the hotel was almost undesirable. I would go there for just to sleep and then get off first thing in the morning.

That guy was around on one of the mornings when I left the room and he told me that all the hotels in NY are suffering from bed-bugs at the moment, even the big places (I don't know if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m allowed to say names on this website...). I know for sure that I am coming back to the Belnord and I can recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in the lovely area between the Hudson River and Central Park.

There are no elevators in the hotel so we had to walk up 5 floors (that's where they put us) everytime we came in and out of the room. BUT it met our needs and it was well within our budget. So we got to spend more money on food, gifts, etc. And we were out and about most of the time. We really only came back to shower & sleep. The customer service that we received from the helpdesk was not good. But they did hold our luggage after checkout for a few hours while we went out to eat. It took us about 10-15 minutes to get to time square from the time we left our hotel door to the time we got to time sq. So if you plan to spend lots of time in the room (which I hope you don't if you are on a personal vacation because there are lots of things to do), then you may get frustrated with the small space and poor customer service.", "Date": "November 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cStay Away for A While\u201d", "Author": "FrugalTraveler50", "ReviewID": "UR4106110", "Content": "There is a bedbug problem....even if the place is quiet and clean no one wants unexpected visitors of this kind.
