Maple Leaf is best for budget travelers who won't mind the size of a room as long as it's clean and you can sleep. The lodging is located on the 11th and 12th floors of Block E in Chung King Mansions where there are many similar accommodations. While at first, the multicultural stores and businesses you would see at the ground floor would give you second thoughts, the building is safe, albeit not very clean. What I like about Maple Leaf is that their land lady/administrator named Lee is very helpful and friendly. She speaks English too so no guessing when you talk to her. Their rooms are HK-style apartment-small but the one I stayed in was very clean and air-conditioning was really cold. I would have wanted the shower heater to work seamlessly but it has to be pre-bath turned on so you can get that hot shower. Also, you have to be careful about your TV's volume (and any other volume of bedroom activities) since they can be audible from the outside. I love that they have free Wi-Fi, water, and tissue! Over-all, I would say, I was satisfied with my personal stay in HK because of Maple Leaf; very accessible and just right for the price!", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as we thought!!!\u201d", "Author": "julien B", "ReviewID": "UR131059353", "Content": "stayed 8night in maple leaf hong kong, at first when we arrived we were told that we booked a room with no windows(which we did not know as when we booked no one mentioned it) so after we paid an extra 700hk dollars (\u00a360,\u20ac80) we discovered the room, tiny, but at first sight it looked allright. unfortunatly after 10mn we just noticed that the floor was covered with hair and body hair, the bed sheet were smelling and worst when we moved the bed we found a ton of dust(it might have not been cleaned in the last 10month), the toilet sit and the all toilet were covered with pee(see the pics) and cherry on the top of the cake wi fi is really bad at night, chungking mansion is not scary its ok but this place it is, for the same price (460hk$ per night) we could have found better place than this, a little hotel not an hostel surounded by drug dealers(as peope smoke crack on the stairs) we also bought some ticket to ocean park,the lady/owner sold them for 260hk$ when we found them for 250hk$ at other places and she mentioned that it wont be any queue with those ones as we gonna be able to jump it, it was false she lied as their is no fast ticket available for the park!!! towel were not cleaned and smelly, when we mentioned it she looked upset and changed them saying that it was fresh ones (maybe but not well tho i would say). we also slept at a friend place one night and on the morning when we came back we were expecting the room to be cleaned but it hasnt !!! we ve been travelling asia for 3month now and didnt not stayed in 5stars hotel, but even in mainland china we had better place and cleanest place than that, it has been such a disapointment, I really hope they will improve the quality of their services, as their price is quiet high they have to give what people pay for, and looking at previous coments,i did not have toothbrush or even soap!!!I really hope this comment will help people but honestly i would not recommand this place to anyone!!", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cGood location, clean\u201d", "Author": "Heiress7", "ReviewID": "UR130724465", "Content": "The directions given by the hostel were great.

Yes, the CKM has a reputation but my experience in no way was negative. The location is superb. It is only a short walk to the Star Ferry pier with the bus from the airport stopping right in front of the building. Equally convenient is the subway. The Tsim Sha Tsui station is but steps from the entrance on Nathan. For those who fear the touts, there really is nothing to fear. Just walk with conviction, say \"no thank you\" if they attempt to divert you to a different establishment and maintain your civility. All will be well. I did purchase a SIM card immediately upon my arrival and that propreitor pointed me in the direction of elevator E and presto, I was on the 12th floor and being greeted by the very courteous Miss Lee. Regarding the rooms, I stayed in a single. The rooms was quite small but impeccably clean with tile covering the floor and all walls (much more easily cleaned than carpet). The bed was a single but more than adequate for yours truly. The room had no windows but that didn't bother me as I was there only to sleep after a long day of seeing the sites. The room had an effective air conditioner, television set, telephone and a variety of AC plugs including the U-ground of North America that I required. The washroom .... yes, you have a private washroom ... was small and was really just a large shower stall in which was situated a a toilet and sink. The water heater was of the tankless type that you turned on about 30 seconds before you began your shower and turned off when finished. The only trick is ensuring that you did all your \"business\" before your shower so as to avoid wet feet but hey, it all works. Their are a pair of elevators for each tower in the Chung King Mansions. One elevator handles even numbered floors, the other the odd numbered floors. There are of course stairs as well so you can take the other elevator and walk up or down one flight if you so choose. There is plenty of shopping on the ground floor of the CKM. It can be a bit intimidating but it can also be a lot of fun. Many food choices too although as I was eating on my adventures, I usually only bought a few vegi samosas, from a vendor by my elevator, for a late snack up in my room. So, in conclusion, if you need only a sleeping space and are looking for a nice price, this establishment should suit you well. My only regret is that I stayed in HK for only four nights. I should have done seven. If and when I return to HK for a part two of my explorations, I will certainly consider this establishment depending on just what my requirements might be at the time. I would also have no problem recommending it to any budget travellers that need a clean and convenient place to stay. db", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cSuper clean, safe and friendly\u201d", "Author": "Anfisa55", "ReviewID": "UR119618781", "Content": "Chunking Mansions aside, the guest house is very clean and safe.

Tips that you should do are pretending that you were already knew where to go, so they won't bother you a lot. Suddenly there was an old woman approaching me, I thought that she would be another tout so I pretend not to be interested, but she is holding my friend's name (who made the booking in this guest house). I finally found it later that she is the owner of the guest house. She said that she has been waiting for us since she was worried that we would get lost and we didn't call her yet. She's very friendy and helpful. We felt that we are suddenly felt in safe hands for that night. We also found that Baba (who is in the reception) was very helpful too and friendly. The room is small for three persons, but hey...this is Hong Kong, most of the rooms are small unless you would like to pay extra (vagant) for rooms, you would have big size ones. The bathroom is small but clean. There's also complimentary Wi-Fi in the room which is very helpful for us to connect to the wired world. The location is very good, near to Tsim Tsa Sui (sorry if it's mistakenly spelled) Station, near to the McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Seven Eleven so you would find it helpful to get a food.
