The lounge area is perfect for entertainment or just a quick dinner working with your laptop. Home House has the look and feel of a English club which have been updated to the requirements of the 21st century with great care to the small details that truly make a hotel stand out from the rest. The rooms are large by London standards and really feel homely. The only complaint is that staff and service doesn\u2019t really live up towhat I would expect at that price but if you are not on a budget (its hard to claim maximum value for money) and not have very high demands on service (i.e the type of person that gives the hotel a bad review for having to wait 3 min to check in) you should defiantly try Home House even though that you after the initial passion has left may you notice that everything isn\u2019t as perfect as you thought, still it is a great place to stay.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHome House exceeded all expectations!\u201d", "Author": "JErikssonLondon", "ReviewID": "UR124257111", "Content": "I had the pleasure of being invited to Home House last Friday by a friend and what a place it is!! An architectural masterpiece! We arrived around 7pm for some casual drinks at the Bison Bar and the atmosphere was already on top, great crowd with an ecclectic vibe made for a very interesting night to say the least! The cocktails were delicious, especially Portman's Delight, i highly recommend that one. The service was attentive, polite and very firendly- everything you would expect from a Private Members' Club.

Pity thing is that this always attracts a double amount of wannabes. It makes you wonder whether their membership is worth it. It definitely does not stop people gazing through the salons making pictures with you in it. The Home House seems to be a bit short of staff. Even though every one is extremely friendly it does take some time your eager pointing finger or waving hand noticed. Money wise a good thing. Getting drunk on an average of \u00a312 for a glass of wine is quite a diet for your wallet. True. The house is beautiful that's a given. The rooms outdated that's a certain. But who does sleep here hoping for a spa in the bathroom or even an a.c.? I slept in the Duke of Atholl suite. Third floor front side. It was the most fantastic autumn weekend with a sweet 28\u00b0 C daytime temperature. My room at night did not get any colder than that. The Duke of Atholl suite is huge and covers almost one third of the front side building. Vestibule, sitting room, bed room and bath room with grandeur. It's like waking up in Pride and Prejudice. Either you like it or you hate it. Leave expectations at home and enjoy because this is by far the funniest place to see London from the inside. You're a part of the London society in-crowd for a weekend. A once in a lifetime experience that no 5 star hotel can ever give you. My verdict? I'd come back just because it\u2019s different.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSeriously Deteriorated\u201d", "Author": "vruce_je", "ReviewID": "UR114665360", "Content": "A must to avoid.

HH also has 17 guest rooms which are available to members, guests and people \"known\" by the staff or management of HH. We spent two nights at HH and all in all this is a fine place to stay in central London. The location is fantastic, about 100 yards away from the bustle of Oxford Street, yet in a refined and fairly quiet neighborhood. The building itself was converted from several very old buildings and is beautiful, but is a warren of hallways and byways. It took us about a day to get our bearings and not get lost. The lift looks like an ancient contraption but seems to be safe and efficient. All of the rooms don't have numbers but are named after famous people, i.e. we stayed in \"Sir Anthony Blunt's Room\". The room itself overlooks the fairly quiet back courtyard and is of palatial dimensions with the largest bathroom we've ever seen in a hotel. The room had a mere two fireplaces. The mattress set is manufactured by Savoir beds (as in Savoy Hotel) and probably the most comfortable we've ever slept in. The room is furnished with antique (or antique style, we're no experts) furniture and thus has the usual ups and downs - great to look at, but not functionally ideal. We experienced things like wobbly night tables, missing closet door handles, uncomfortable seating etc. The shower was great with a dinner plate size shower head, high water pressure and really hot water. We didn't use the freestanding cast iron bathtub. I guess the the two separate water taps in each of two sinks is a matter of taste. The air conditioning is fairly quiet but not very effective. It was barely sufficient for April, I would doubt if you would be happy in mid summer. Of course you could open the ancient windows if they don't jam and if you are willing to put up with residual racket (sirens, alarms, deliveries etc.) floating over during the night from Marble Arch. The biggest issue was the service. The gentleman who checked us in (Farouk) was excellent. The chambermaid also was very good. Many of the other staff were a bit ineffective and preoccupied with other things. Small matters like wake up calls, getting taxis or drink orders were forgotten. The check out process (due to a new software being installed) took quite a long time. The members themselves tended to be loud business types who use the club for hard selling and hard drinking, so the bars and restaurants were not the quiet haven we had hoped for after a long day in London. Food and drink were reasonably priced for Central London and of excellent quality. In sum we were very happy with HH. It could use a bit of polishing and then would be a great alternative to the classic grand hotels.", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cOld fashioned elegance, combined with gracious manners.\u201d", "Author": "Popperoo", "ReviewID": "UR6177009", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for one night only, as we were attending a dinner of old school friends in the city.

The ajoining bathroom was also a huge size, with a wonderfully large bath, and separate room with shower. All in marble with his and hers sinks. We had breakfast in one of the lounges, and I can honestly say that the staff here were exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble and they all knew who we were and were most gracious.

Since our flight arrived early and our hotel room was not ready for us, we were upgraded into a 3-room suite on the 2nd floor of the hotel overlooking the front entrance of the hotel and the park across the street. We had a living room with fireplace, enormous bedroom with fireplace and an enormous bathroom with marble and lion-footed bathtub and amenities galore. The staff were marvelous! Fresh fruits and flowers in our suite during the 3-days we stayed. The Concierge recommended 2 very different restaurants each evening - one of them being the adjoining hotel dining room. Food was fantastic, and they geared the time to serve the meal to the opening time of the curtain at the theatre we were going to that evening. Being a travel agent, I had one of the staff give me a tour of various rooms and can tell you if you rent one of the \"ordinary rooms\" you will feel like you are the owner of this palacial building. The inner courtyard gardens can be used for private functions and is large enough to include a tented structure for more formal large parties. When I have clients looking for a hotel in London - this is the first hotel I recommend. Depending on your budget, this hotel will make a lasting impression on you for many years to come.
