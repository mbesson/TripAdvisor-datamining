The hotel is not on the water, but a short walk and I was in the sand. The open and airy hotel doesn't look like most Holiday Inns - this is Caribbean treat. My best memory was the bar/restaurant. I sat outside land enjoyed the January evening, listening the unique frogs and ordering individual portions until I was stuffed. The asian restaurant was not as much fun - good food, but a different atmosphere. The pool as nice and the view from my room was great. The hotel is close to the airport, but no so close that you hear the planes. I didn't have a car for two days, but that was not a problem. San Juan has a good bus service and a trip the old fort took about 30 minutes. When I did rent a car I got a ticket - it seems that \"Parking for Touristas\" does not mean that tourists can park there - a \"Tourista\" is a sightseeing bus. This was my first visit to Puerto Rico, but it will not be my last. In all honesty I was a bit concerned - you hear about Puerto Rican gangs in New York, but my fears were unfounded. I found the people warm and friendly. One hotel employee told me, \"Everyone speaks some English, so if you try to speak Spanish and they try to speak English you won't have a problem.\" Language was never an issue. The roads are like US highways, you buy gas in liters, the speed limit is posted in miles per hour, but distances are posted in kilometers - takes about 20 minutes to get used to it. US currency, my cell phone worked well and I'm ready to go back.

The La Concha hotel across the street has a very nice full buffet with excellent coffee, hot foods, cheese, eggs, etc, but be prepared to shell out $25 per person. Speaking of La Concha, you can also go to the beach in front of the hotel and rent a chair for $5 per day and sit there like you're one of the Jet Set. You can even take advantage of the cocktail service on the beach as long as you have time to wait and are willing to spend a little money.

We also wondered whether the bedsheets had been changed from previous guests, but did not discover this until the morning.

Have stayed at many Holiday Inn Express properties all over the US, but rate this hotel the worst. This hotel will definitely not help Holiday Inn improve their brand image. All the comments about small rooms & tiny (1 person) bathrooms are true, but that is not the basis of our complaint. However, the comments about the employee who is \"supposedly\" in charge of the breakfast service, confirms our experience. We have visited San Juan dozens of times for 20+ years, & stayed all over the area around this hotel, so we know the area & like it. We also remember this hotel during prior years when it had various names, but then it sat abandoned for several years before being remodeled & renamed Holiday Inn Express. So we gave it a try, but it was definitely a mistake. The uphostelry on the room/desk chair was so filthy that we covered it with a towel before we would sit in it. All the lamp shades looked like they had come from a flea market, torn/worn/tattered, & light bulbs were missing in 2 of the 3. Don't know when this hotel renovation was actually completed, but it could already use a serious update. Don't know how sheets, that are supposedly changed after each guest, can be this wrinkled & look like the ones on our bed, but it raised serous red flags about cleanliness. And the phone never did work. Apparently they had it blocked to prevent calls from being made, & neither the night or day front desk employees knew how to unblock the line. The tiny bathroom was OK-clean, but the fixtures look like the place has not been remodeled for years. And breakfast, which is a selling feature of the Holiday Inn Express brand, was non-existent upon our arrival about 8:15AM. The ENTIRE food offering consisted of 3-4 stale-looking danish, a loaf of bread that had been torn open for access, 3-4 boiled eggs in the refrigerator unit, & some cereal that we had no intention of touching after looking around the room. That was it. Nothing else. There was no milk, or hot water for tea. No regular coffee, only de-caf. There was not a single, solitary item of \"any\" kind in the unit where hot food is supposed to be placed, & the refrigerator unit had nothing in it except the 3-4 boiled eggs. Zero. In fact, these 2 pieces of food equipment seemed to be brand new, like they had never been used. There a few people sitting in the breakfast area & they stated that they were only having the de-caf coffee & had not seen ANY employee in the breakfast area since their arrival. One couple said it had been that same way the 2 prior mornings of their stay. Did the same employee another reviewer complained about, simply fail to show up for work for 3 days? Or is this standard operating procedure? We moved to another property in the immediate area, but since we were only a 10 minute walk away, we returned 2 more mornings between 8-9AM just to see if our experience was an accident, but it wasn't. The same exact breakfast room scenario was present. Non-existent food. Coffee pots empty. Looked like an abandoned, unkempt lunch room. This is a problem property for Holiday Inn, that I predict will not remain in the chain much longer. Several other pleasant properties in the immediate area, so try them. No need to spend extra to \"mistakenly think\" you're going to get something better at this hotel.

FYI if you are using a GPS system, Mapquest, or the map off the Holiday Inn website you will be shown a different location on those maps. Nonetheless locate the Gucci or Cartier Stores on Ashford Ave and the hotel is on the side street in between them. Mariano Ramirez Badges is a one way street that only stretches about 1 1/2 blocks an is bordered on the south by the Lagoon and on the north by Ashford Ave. Directly across the street on Ashford Ave is a vast grass plaza (open to the public) that belongs to the Renaissance La Concha Hotel. The plaza leads directly to the beach and a pier. Hotel: Seven stories Biege concrete structure that is decorated in a tropical contemporized motif. The hotel offers only 16 parking spaces in a small adjacent lot for $10 a day. Reserve your spot with the booking since it fills up quickly. The hotel offers king and double rooms. A continental breakfast (Bagels, breakfast pasties, cereals, hard boiled eggs, fruits, juice, milk and coffee) is served daily from 6am to 10am. A small pool, business center, and fitness center are also offered. Something not offered is coin laundry. Room: All rooms are tiled and offer a tube television, mini fridge and free Wi-Fi and other additional amenities. The room(s) I stayed at was 601, directly right of the elevator. Although being close to the elevator I never heard any loud noises in my room. The second room was 702 which was mid hallway. The rooms had the same d\u00c3\u00a9cor however 601 was two feet wider then 702 and 601 also contained a mini-fridge and 702 did not. The bathrooms were small however I believe they are standard hotel size. The beds have wheels and tend to move when you move. Air Conditioner unit is in room and you control it yourself. Staff is courteous, friendly and accommodating. Want to go to Old San Juan? Free city bus stop is one block away on Ashford. Hotel tends to get busy on weekends when its fills up with people who are boarding a cruise in the nearby Old San Juan Port. Within Walking Distance Walgreen's 24 Hour Pharmacy, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Renaissance La Concha Casino, Marriott Casino, Chili's, Churches Chicken, Burger King, Krash Puerto Rico, Juniors VIP I and II, Circus Bar Lounge Bottom Line: I really enjoyed this hotel.

[Ajili Mojili and La Ropa Vieja were our favorites.] The room was very clean and the beds and shower were nice (typical HI Exp). The bathroom was on the small side and didn't have the extra sink outside that you sometimes get. The room was fairly typical, but perhaps a little small. The pool was also small, but more than adequate for my kids. Beach access was 1.5 blocks away, but we didn't take advantage of that since we were going to Luquillo and Vieques later in our trip. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel was exactly what we were looking for (value, location) without paying high prices and resort fees. One word of caution: parking is precarious. They have a few slots but they are not easy to get into because of the parking across the street.

The hotel did give us another room, but this one had a broken lock, i.e. the electronic lock stopped working and it took the maintenance guy almost half an hour to get us back into our room. 3.

We arrived about 2am after a very long flight. Upon arrival, the hotel gave us our two rooms. We were to have 4 people in one room and two in the other. Although the rooms were for a \"maximum of 4\" people, there was only one bed in each. Although the desk clerk looked for a cot, I doubt it would have fit in the room anyway. The staff found us another room, for an extra charge, one floor down for our children, which was not at all optimal, but they had no more rooms for 4 people. Our other party of two stayed two floors down. As mentioned, the rooms were incredibly tiny. The bathroom almost left no room to sit on the toilet (and we are quite fit). The bed was nice, with comfy sheets and usual HIE accessories in the room. We had a tiny window that looked out onto a small street and then onto another building. Noises were quite easily heard from outside the room. Of course there were lots of people leaving and moving about, but we had just arrived and wanted to sleep. Parking was $10/night. The lot was very tight and had concrete barriers to navigate through in order to park the vehicle. Our van was not ready the night we arrived so the rental agency brought it to us the next morning. The man from the agency scratched up the entire side of the van trying to navigate between the parking blocks, which must be meant to keep others from parking there. Breakfast was adequate. There were none of the nice cinnamon rolls that HIE is noted for, however. The dining area was congested and poorly serviced.

I've read all these fantastic reviews for this hotel, so I thought I was getting a steal on my hotel rate. Though, when I got there, I was a little dissapointed and thought, well this is I guess what you pay for. They say the location is perfect, but with all the surrounding construction, my vision must have been skued. Don't get me wrong, Cartier is right around the corner, and so is Mont Blanc, and Louis Vuitton but also grafitti also within eye's view. And there were many places to eat (mainly chains) within walking distance. There are no frills; no grand lobby,opulant decor, but it is a budget hotel so that's clearly what it was. The rooms were descent sized and yes, at the end of the hall (on our 5th floor) we did have a view of the ocean. The bathroom is tiny, be prepared to back onto the toilet and turn your legs slightly and you're practically in the shower or right next to the sink. The free continental breakfast was a plus, Not many places offer that. They served cereals, bagels, toast, and oatmeal. The coffee, let's say, well it's free. The front desk was very helpful and very nice. I will agree with the other reviewers. The beach 1/2 a block away wasn't too pretty. It was surrounded by grafitti, so we walked an extra 5 min. onto Marriott's, where we used their beach chairs and towels. We did rent a car for the other half of the trip outside San Juan, and that was literally 1-2 blocks away. I think that was one of the best features for the location of the hotel. There are a lot of hotels in the Condado area, and it was a good value for it's money. But if the beach is one of your top priorities, don't expect much from the Holiday Inn Express. For the extra money, we would have stayed at the Holiday Inn in Isla Verde b/c it was alittle higher grade in accomodations and the location was more central. It will also limit the taxi ride fare, which could be applied towards a better hotel instead.

The conential breakfast was enought and if you were one who wanted to eat more it was always there as scheduled. The computer room with three cpu's was good and it did not cost extra as I found out in the Marriott. The location great only a couple minutes to the beach and the fine dining places. While there is some construction of other condo's taking place near the Express. It was not a big problem and I did not noise much during the day and none at night. The pool is OK not large not much sun gets to it but OK. Now the hot tub beside the pool was nice and could be used at anytime. The Gym OK for one who needs to keep there exercise program but most often I would join the others jogging by the beach area. Yes the bathrooms are small but since I was only about 154lbs, it was OK. Now for one alot more then that it may be an issue. The location as stated is great. The bus system to OSJ runs every 30minutes + or - , and only cost 75 cents.

They confirmed the price including taxes and provided me with a confirmation number. When checking out make sure you check your bill. They tried to charge the $5 surcharge I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read about on this board. I would not agree to it since I had a confirmation number for the exact amount they quoted. At first the guy tried to tell me it was a tax and I disputed and giving him my breakdown (which was on the bill) and advised him I was not paying for a surcharge since it was not on my confirmation. They removed the $5 from the bill. So stand firm and dispute this charge. We caught a taxi from the airport to the hotel. $14 plus first 3 pieces of luggage are .50 each the remainder are $1 each. Our total was $15.50 since we only had 3 pieces of luggage. This hotel is in a good location for the money. If you don't mind walking there are all types of restaurants nearby. We picked up soda and bottled water for the week from Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Princess allows you to carry it on with no problems. You can also purchase and carry on liquor. Old San Juan is an easy 3 mile walk, or take the bus (must have exact change (coins .75 one way, B21) Once you are in Old San Juan ride the free trolley to get familiar with the area. There are two routes the trolley follows. Shared a taxi to the ship with another couple to the pier was $22. They overcharged but did not realize this until we were at the pier since the taxis were striking that morning and we had a difficult time getting there. After the cruise we stored our luggage on the corner from the cruise ship. Large luggage was $3, small carryon was $1. When we went back for our luggage someone got us a taxi. There was another couple with their child going back to the airport at the same time and we wanted to share the taxi. We agreed to $5 each. After agreeing on the price they slipped another couple in the taxi with us and charged everyone (7 of us) $5 each. We were way overcharged for this ride to the airport. Also the guy who got us the taxi wanted a tip from each of us. Save yourself the hassle and GET YOUR OWN TAXI and eliminate the middleman who did nothing but arrange a ride to the airport.

The rooms are somewhat small, but if you are planning on staying in the room the entire time you are in the Caribbean, you probably need some counseling! The only thing about the rooms that I could even find to complain about is the floor is cold... there's no carpet, just tile. The a/c worked just fine in my room... other's complained that it was warm. That might be the side of the building that they were on. I assume the afternoon sun would make the room hotter. After reading reviews of other similar-priced hotels, I was ready for bugs in my room, which is common in a tropical environment. There were no bugs to be found!! The pool area is quite small and somewhat boxed in with the high rises around it. And yes, one of the buildings is under construction. The hot tub was fun in the evening after a day of sight-seeing. And speaking of sight-seeing, the city busses only cost 25 cents. The B21 bus takes you right to the heart of Old San Juan! If you need a car for a day or two, there is an Avis right across the street. Taxi from the airport is less than $15.00. Overall, I'd definitely return to this hotel.
