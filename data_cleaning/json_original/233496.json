{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a find! What a fantastic stay we had at Residence La Repubblica! We booked online through Venere.com, and we got 4 nights for 300 Euros. But beyond the fantastic deal, this was an awesome place to stay. For starters, the location can't be beat. It's right on Piazza de la Repubblica, which is a great pedestrian plaza only 2 minutes walk from the Duomo. And since it was right in the middle of town, we could easily swing back during the day. The apartment itself was terrific: a 1-bedroom apartment with shower and toilet, a kitchenette, and hundreds of satellite TV channels. A comfy bed, an elevator, and good A/C also added to the experience. We had so much room in the place that we didn't know what to do with it! By far the best place we stayed during our entire trip.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR224622386", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Krivokrasov"}, {"Content": "BEST KEPT SECRET! I feel like I'm a local in Florence! 4 years ago i was sitting in the caffe in Piazza della Repubblica when i noticed what seemed like tourists leaving what I thought was just another beautiful Italian residential building - of course I had to ask - sure enough they confirmed it was a residence with fantastic rooms to rent! The BEAUTIFUL ROOMS, EXTRAORDINARY LOCATION, cleanliness and incredible value are what makes me (and allows me!) return year after year - picture an elegantly but simply appointed room (some have frescoes on the ceiling!) with a living room area and a fully loaded kitchennette - now picture this overlooking one of the most beautiful squares in Florence! That's Residenza della Repubblica. I have sent many friends over the years and everyone has returned happy. The building and furnishings easily retain their character and charm while at the same time offer all modern conveniences - excellent security system, airconditioning and sound proof windows as well as a bathroom that makes my home in the USA envious! Florence is the most beautiful and artistically rich city - now I actually feel like I live there! hope you enjoy it! (suggestion: if coming from train station, and you packed lightly, I'd just walk to Hotel Lanzi for check-in. I usually fly out early in morning so can just take a taxi from the all night waiting taxi line there in the piazza behind the Merry-go-round.) Ps. They recently opened up several family apartments on the bottom floors - they look great!", "Date": "Jul 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR829259584", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "haynesfamily2008"}, {"Content": "Excellent location - shame about the breakfast! Excellent location for Repubblica and A Casa di Alino, being central to the Duomo.We stayed at the Repubblica. Rooms were clean,airy and light with a small balcony overlooking the main pedestrian street below. Bathroom was small but clean and modern.We made the mistake of booking through an agent (italia lodging)and the whole deposit went to that agent so book direct.Breakfast was a major disappointment. Everything was put out and left in the sun, warm yoghurt, melted butter, warm juices, milk and long life pre-packed croissants. This let the place down quite a bit but overall the place was very good. Booking direct would have saved us money. We paid 187 euros for 2 nights. We would recommend it and would stay again.

Looking at how vibrant this square seemed we knew the location was right, but what about the apartment? It was fantastic. There is a small lift to take you to the second or third floor where we were shown into a 2 bedroom apartment. The size of the apartment was what really amazed us first of all, with the bedroom being enormous. The apartment had a small cooking kitchenette consisting of a hob, fridge, washing up facilities and a table and chairs. The rooms were very clean and our beds and towels were changed daily, which was great, as it was like staying in a hotel, but with the ability to cook for yourself. Included in the price was breakfast at their nearby sister hotel again an added bonus. The residence was so central with the Duomo and Baptistry only a few minutes away as was the Santa Croc. We would often go back to our hotel for lunch it was so central. The only problem we had was building work was being undertaken on the building next door, however as we went over Easter we only heard the workmen once, but I would recommend when booking this hotel asking if that is still the case, as there was no mention of it when we booked. The residence was very secure with keyless entry systems. A truly lovely residence which suited us as a family travelling with a great location. just so central.", "Date": "May 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR974091427", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SarahLi"}, {"Content": "A good apartment style hotel We stayed in a 2 room / 4 people apartment at the residence. The place was clean, well maintained and secured with electronic locks. The location right on Piazza Repubblica was ideal but we did not find the windows to keep the sound of the incessant tribal drummers out of the room completely. Nothing a set of earplugs couldn't fix. The kitchen in a closet was perfectly useful and we had a couple of simple meals of fresh ravioli and salad bought at Firenze's markets. Apparently the queen size bed was perfectly comfortable but the 2 singles my mom and I had were lacking. Better to visit as a couple I guess. I could leave the included breakfast for a cappucino and brioche at one of the historic cafes right outside the door of the residence.", "Date": "May 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR702415487", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gretagretchen"}, {"Content": "Very Nice Place to Stay When in Florence We booked a room at the Hotel Delanzi , when we arrived we were asked if we minded staying at another property owned by the hotel because the rooms were bigger and there was 3 of us.

The Residence is really an apartment building, not a hotel, but the room was large with a balcony right on the Piazza De la Repubblica. The Piazza is teeming with life , great for people watching.

While obtaining entrance to the hotel was difficult because the desk is currently located at Hotel de Lanzi several blocks away (with no sign to indicate such), once settled we found our room spacious, clean, and stocked with all the usual ammenities. The small kitchen unit was especially helpful and the bathroom was comfortable for the two of us. All windows closed to block out the noises of the street when we wished for quiet. One of the best features of La Repubblica is its location, right on Piazza Repubblica with many shops, the flower mart, restaurants, post office and banking facilities.

If you remember that the check-in is a few blocks away at the Hotel DeLanzi, you will avoid some confusion as the entrance is unobtrusive and requires a key.
