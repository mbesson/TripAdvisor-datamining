Today I see that it is #4. The condo was well appointed, had sleep number beds and was very clean. No complaints on the unit except that I paid for a lake front unit. Could not even see the water. Lake was about 1/4 mile down lane with no swim dock. Condo company also advertized Free WiFi. We arrived late Saturday afternoon due to Hurricane Issac rain. It was about 4:00 when we checked in. We received pool towels, maps, attraction discont tickets etc. I did not mention internet since it was advertized that all units had Wi Fi. Late that evening when trying to get on line I discovered that there was no cordless internet. An ethernet cable was needed to connect to internet. The next am was Saturday and the office was closed. The next day was Labor Day and again the office was closed. Internet access was not just a \"like to have\" resource for our vacation. Our businesses depend on internet access. To say we were disappointed to sit on a balcony with no view except trees and not being able to get on the internet was extremely frustating. Actually spoiled a 3 day get away. Back to Lake of the Ozarks for us.

We had never been to Branson, and did not know the area or its amenities. We put our trust in TripAdvisor and picked the #1 rated hotel accommodation on the list. We were not disappointed with our choice; particularly after seeing the vast array of older motel style accommodations in the area. The Village at Indian Point is a resort of individually owned condominiums located about six miles west of the Route 76 strip in Branson. The place is a couple of miles south of Silver Dollar City, a popular theme park. We booked a two bedroom two bath unit through the resort\u2019s website just a week before our visit. Our condo was everything we expected and was neat as a pin. Each unit is individually owned, so the d\u00e9cor and amenities differ slightly from unit to unit. Ours had fishing lodge d\u00e9cor based around the owner\u2019s apparent interest in trout fishing. The furnishings and beds were comfortable. There was a basically equipped kitchen, with the items needed to prepare breakfast and other simple meals. Coffee maker, but no free coffee supplies; so if you think you will need something, bring it or buy it. Traveling by car, we brought a large bin of supplies from our pantry, and a large ice chest with food and drinks. Our unit in Lodge 10 was on the middle level, which was at parking lot level, so no stairs to navigate (nice!). The two bathrooms were clean and well stocked with towels, some basic toiletries and paper goods. There is no maid service during the stay, so one would need to run a load in the full size washer & dryer in the laundry room. There were three flat screen TVs with each with a DVD player, and about 60 cable channels. The Wi-Fi provided good internet access for our electronics. One of the nice features of the condo was the balcony with views of Table Rock Lake in the distance. The deck was 30\u2019 x 12\u2019, and this end unit had a second smaller balcony off the dining area. Our unit had a porch swing and table and chairs, and it was very pleasant and relaxing to sit outdoors. It felt like we were up in a tree house with all the green trees surrounding the unit. Our experience was quiet and peaceful, with no noisy neighbors; but I suspect noise and foot traffic could be an issue if there was a higher level of occupancy. The resort has both outdoor and indoor swimming pools which were inviting and not crowded. Overall we had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay at The Village at Indian Point a \u201chome away from home\u201d. Thanks to all TripAdvisors for taking the time to write these reviews.

It was pretty close to most everything we planned to do in Branson. We would probably only consider staying here again if we left our boat at home. First, they do not have their own boat ramp, so we had to drive to a nearby resort to use theirs. Maneuvering with the trailer was very difficult because of the narrow layout and limited trailer parking. The access to the boat dock was terrible both from the condo and the water. It was a pretty far walk on steep, gravel roads if you tried to walk to and from your condo.

Be sure to rent a boat at the State Park Marina if you enjoy boating, even if you haven't done this before, they offer instruction on how to operate the boats and it was a highlight, also see Dogwood Canyon if you enjoy the outdoors.

At the outset, we were very impressed by the comfortable accommodations with all the conveniences of home (i.e. washer/dryer, dishwasher, wi-fi, large comfortable beds, flat screen TVs, etc.). The view of the lake was beautiful and a late afternoon thunderstorm was such a pleasant relief to the sweltering August heat, that we opened the door to the balcony. We did have a couple of small suggestions for the management. The provided utensils in the kitchens are hit or miss. For instance, there were several times when a pair of scissors would have been handy, but there were none available. But, we had plenty of dishes and cooking utensils. Dishwasher detergent was provided, but not laundry detergent. (available for fee at the office) Also, since there is no maid service during your stay, you need to keep things tidy on your own, which any parent of a six and two year old knows is tough. Some extra cleaning supplies would have been helpful (i.e. broom and mop, or even a Swiffer) Our largest complaint was that some of the units above and next door our condo were being renovated. The workers started every morning at 7:30. This made it especially difficult to sleep in for our vacation. I addressed it with the office and they said they would take care of it, but it only got a little quieter for one morning, returning to normal levels the following day. I'm not unrealistic. I know they couldn't just stop working. However, they shouldn't have rented that unit if they knew there would be work going on around it. The noise would have lowered my rating, had it not been for the following saving grace. During our stay, our six year old daughter was horsing around in her room and broke the leg off a decorative stool. When I went to check out, I voiced my disappointment about the construction noise and then explained the broken stool and offered to pay for its replacement. The (assumed) manager overheard the conversation and told me not to worry about the stool I offered again, but she said it was to make up for the noise problem. I was pleasantly surprised and grateful. Overall, this turned out to be a very nice place to stay and I would recommend it highly to anyone visiting Branson. On a side note, we saw three shows while we were there. TODD OLIVER AND HIS TALKING DOGS (ventriloquism act) I'd give it 2 out of 5 stars. Good concept, but needs fine tuning. BUCKETS N BOARDS (percussion comedy show) 5 stars. Very funny and enjoyable for the whole family. They are about to leave for a few months on Disney Cruises, so you can catch them there too. Finally, we saw CIRQUE MONTAGE (circus show, a la Cirque Du Soleil) 4 out of 5 stars. Had some real high points, but don't expect the large scale and quality of a Cirque du Soleil. Very talented performers, but it lacked the variety of acts. Also went to the Talking Rocks Cavern (4/5) Good fun, beautiful cave. Avoid if you are claustrophobic or afraid of heights. Ripley's Believe It or Not Odditorium (3/5) typical Ripley's museum. OK, but not the best of the others I've visited. And the Titanic museum.

There was a strong, unidentifiable stench in the condo that we just lived with for the four days we were there, due to our allergies to scented air fresheners. This particular unit was outdated in furnishings and appliances; everything in it was poor quality, especially the mattresses. Also, when we opened up the hide-a-bed, that mattress was dirty with hair and crumbs. The ceiling and upper level floor is poorly insulated so we heard every move our upstairs neighbors made. This made sleeping at night very frustrating as our neighbors were active and started playing loud music after midnight. My husband went to use the fitness room, and was disappointed that it only contained 3 pieces of equipment, two of which were not working. The \"game room\", which we were looking forward to using, contained an air hockey table that costs 75 cents per play.

If you're looking for a place to stay close to Silver Dollar City, I'd highly recommend this property. You miss all the early morning traffic by coming in from the resort instead of Hwy 76. We checked in on a Monday and checked out on Wednesday in June 2012 and the resort was not crowded. We stayed in #26 on the 3rd floor and had a distance view of the lake from our deck. The condo was well equipped with cooking utensils and pots/pans for our use. We used the charcoal grill on the bottom floor for hamburgers and hotdogs one night which saved us from dining out that night. Having our own washer and dryer was fantastic, great for quick drying of the swimsuits and towels, as well as doing a load of towels for the bathrooms. The kids loved the loft area as well as the deck, great space for them to play as well as have ample space for sleeping. When we checked in, the pull out bed did not have linens, but a quick call to the front desk had that rectified. The staff was at our door within 10 minutes, great response! We did have issues with the local Dominoes pizza delivery, it's difficult to know your exact address or phone number to the condo. Considering all the advertisement in the actual condo for Dominoes, you'd think they'd know exactly who is calling and what the address is. We loved the pools and hot tub, it was so nice after a long day at SDC! The facilities were clean and well-kept. I'd recommend you bring your own beach towels for the pool if you like a bigger towel. Also, bring your own laundry detergent and dryer sheets for the washer and dryer, it may not be provided in your condo. I brought my own napkins, paper plates and cups to cut down on how many dishes need to be washed. Also, if you forget any condiments or cooking ingredients (butter for mac & cheese!), there is at least one grocery store on the way down to the resort once you've passed SDC. You won't have to go all the way back to Branson, but you will pay a premium ($2.19 per box of Kraft mac & cheese, I forgot the box at home!). Very convenient, but pricey!

Let me start by saying I have been going to branson since I was 3 years old. Now much older then that we have stayed in MANY places. This one is hands down the best I have stayed. We request the same room every time and it is allways clean, kitchen is stocked up, beds are nice, decor is top knotch. We travel with 5 ppl, The wife, 2 year old, Mom, Dad and myself. The rooms are spacious for everything we drag along. Bedrooms are nice and has 2 king sized beds, bathrooms are 5 star with 2 whiprool tubs. The back deck is screened in, ( MUST GET THIS) Its so nice to sit out on the deck and eat supper with no bugs. Just you, food and fresh air. The pools are fantastic as well. The outdoor pool is great for my 2 year old since its a 0 entry pool. he can run and splash around without worring about him getting to deep. The indoor pool is also nice for when we make our christmas trips. All in all we went through about 10 years of bouncing around from place to place to see them all. I will never stay anywhere else anymore. We have our next trip comming up in a few months angain and I love not having the stress of worring about what place your getting. Its almost like a second home to us now. And yes we have stayed at all of the big ones, Chatteau, Big cedar, Stillwaters. This one for value, upkeep, and just makeing you feel like your home is by far #1. Once again hands down best place we have stayed out of around 20 diff places in branson. My best tip to give is GET screened in porch. But after that just enjoy your stay. The pools are allways nice!!!", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olathe, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat condo, great view!\u201d", "Author": "NikiD527", "ReviewID": "UR129917513", "Content": "We always stay at the Village at Indian Point when we go to Branson, and are never disappointed.

We were assigned Building 6, Unit 3, either walking down a below grade sidewalk and 9 steps or a even steeper below grade sidewalk. Upon entering the unit it appeared to be clean. As always I walked through and noticed the carpet being dirty in areas. The paint chipped and scratched walls and woodwork lead me to believe that the unit could stand a GOOD going over. The Weber Grill had a grate that was so rusted we didn't want to use it. The kitchen was poorly stocked with only 1 wine glass, the rest being plastic. Some of the dishes were chipped. If I'm paying what I was paying per night I would at least expected a better equipped kitchen, but all in all it seems minor to the overall general appearance and comfort of the Unit. The rooms were a decent size, that is the ONLY reason I gave ROOMS a three rating. The mattress were thin and not comfortable at all. I pulled hairs off of the bed sheets. Where was my Lysol? The TV in the main room was located in such a way that it blocked a part of the fireplace. So okay, we called the front desk, they were gone for the evening so we left a message. The following day we found several dead bugs and spiders in the unit. I took pictures. I went to the front desk. I voiced my concerns and was told that the Unit I was supposed to get had issues and they could not get it done in time. I was never told this prior to my arrival or upon my arrival. We were offered another Unit and went to look at it. It was not worth the move. It seems ironic to me that the information sheet mentions that this is \"someone's\" home and to treat it as such. If this were my home I would make sure it was in better, clean and more up to date shape. The Fitness Center consisted of one elliptical machine that made the most terrible noise, the treadmill worked but not the best at all. The outdoor pool had visible dirt, with leaves, something that looked like bird droppings...but it looks nice...the indoor pool cloudy.

However, the other two condos we stayed in had quality beds and I will request those next time. Getting a good night's sleep is important when you're away from home. As the other reviewers have mentioned, the jacuzzi tubs in the rooms don't work particularly well because of hot water. However, a room with a jacuzzi has a larger bathroom in the master and is much nicer than when we didn't have the jacuzzi.

Kitchen and bathrooms were spotless, and none of the carpet stains or strange smells that have been mentioned about other condos! its definately worth requesting. The only downside was the jacuzzi tub- there was only enough hot water to fill the huge tub about 2\" from the bottom, which brings the water level about 5\" under the jets, rendering it unusabe as a jacuzzi (and we werent using hot water for showers, dishes, or laundry at the time). No big deal, except you pay more for a room with a jacuzzi tub. The view from the deck was fantastic, and it was obvious that the owners have a lot of pride in their place. We werent crazy about the office staff; we only met two women at the front desk and they werent particularly friendly. Not rude, but just seemed annoyed to be bothering with us when we stopped by the office to check in and check out. We probably would not return here, but mostly because its too much for a weekend. The atmosphere is better for a week-long getaway, when you can go to the grocer, cook your meals in the kitchen, make your own beds, etc. For a weekend getaway, better to spend the same money at a hotel and get the room service, fresh towels, and enough hot water to get the jacuzzi jets going", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Collierville, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cLOVED LOVED LOVED Village at Indian Point\u201d", "Author": "lawspike", "ReviewID": "UR91107091", "Content": "Absolutely loved our condo there.

I looked all over the internet for condos, as we have started a tradition for our soon to be 3 year old granddaughter to spend Thanksgiving in Branson & see the lights at Silver Dollar City. Everything was booked because I started looking late. I tried to book Stormy Point thru Expedia, but it was already booked. So, we were down to look at some vacation property & knew we were close to Village at Indian Point, so we decided to visit them personally. Sooooo glad we did! We fell in love with it the moment we drove in! The lodge is absolutely gorgeous! This place is perfect for the Fall! The lady in charge let us take a look at Lodge 13, Unit 5. Corner unit, so there was a small balcony on the side. There was a view of the lake & it was great! We decided to take it! We got a discount because we have AARP & the first night, our daughter wouldn't be there, so they didn't charge the extra $5 for that night. That is one of the few things that bugged us. They charge for more than 2 people. Strange. 2 bedrooms, yet they don't charge by the unit. They go by the number of people staying. Anyway, we saved the equivelant of the tax with the AARP discount. It never dawned on me to look into the cabinets when we were touring the unit. I always prepare our Thanksgiving dinner when we stay. We got there & all that was provided was salt & pepper in the shakers! No staples whatsoever! No mixer, colander, blender or spatula! We had to purchase these things! There was a full size washer & dryer, but no soap or dryer sheets. I have an HE washer & dryer, so purchasing detergent for this one was a total waste of money for me! Guess I will give the detergent to my mom. My daughter has the HE washer, too, so giving it to her is out. Other than that, this place is perfect! They even have candles to light, so it can really be cozy! The fireplace is wood burning, so that was kind of a pain. But, we built some beautiful fires. Our little granddaughter would go out with her 'BahBah' to get the wood & she would bring it in from the beautiful front deck when we were building the fire! So cute! We could never get the DVD player to work in the living room, but the one in each bedroom worked. Also, the thermostat would never stay where we put it. It always reverted back to 62 degrees. A royal pain when you came in from the cold after a long day. The electricity went out on Thanksgiving morning(we have our dinner on Friday each year, so no biggy)for about 2 hours. I just lit the candles & we built a fire & it was nice! The sprayer on the sink needed to be repaired. I turned on the faucet~NOT the sprayer~& it popped off the hose to it & shot water straight up onto the ceiling! NOT fun! It just needed to be screwed back on. I was leary of it the rest of the time! There was plenty of room for 3 adults & a little one. Nice amenities, nice appliances(range needed to be smooth top instead of old fashioned burners~kind of odd for high end appliances), and decorated very nicely! There was a jetted tub in the master bedroom(the view of the lake from the master bedroom was awesome!), but when we tried to use it, the hot water had run out. I ran a load of dishes & our daughter took a short shower right before that. Hot water never returned that evening! This was a 'walk-in' unit & it was really nice not having to walk up or down stairs! The closets were full-size & a welcome for putting our luggage in! The dressers were great, too! Lots of room to store our clothes! We really liked the fact that they didn't give us a long list of what to do when we left. We always leave our 'home away from home' clean & tidy, anyway. We always want to be welcomed back, should we stay again. This was a very quiet place. The condo was very sound. Our granddaughter isn't the quietest of children! She is 3 in January~YOU do the math! LOL! No one complained, so I guess the walls are pretty thick! This is very convenient to Silver Dollar City & Branson West. We were roughly 5 minutes to SDC! We did go into Branson for dinner one night. This was a very smooth experience. Very reasonably priced~$156 per night. For this time of year in Branson & SDC, that is very reasonable for a condo! The entrance is decorated very beautifully! There are 3 waterfalls that are absolutely gorgeous at the entrance. they have beautiful lighted angels, etc adorning the entrance as well as in front of the lodge. Oh! I almost forgot about the pool! We just took it for granted that there would be towels in the pool area. Nope. The ONE time I don't pack beach towels! There is a water element~kind of 3 little fountain type things that spray upward about a foot or so~in the hot tub on a ledge & they don't want you to walk on them or anything like that. Yeah~trying telling a toddler to stay off of THOSE! Riiiiiiight! The water in the hot tub was really nice. They have a kiddie pool that is ice cold. The regular pool was nice. It could have been a few degrees warmer, but it was warmer than most 'heated' pools. They have a nice restroom that has a wicker sofa to sit on while you change. Nice touch. There is a game room that is pretty good & also, an exercise room. The lodge is really beautiful! There are wild animals mounted on the walls & a huge stuffed bear that is awesome! They have a Christmas tree & the lady was nice enough to take our photo in front of it. They have DVDs you can rent for $1(I think that is the cost)& I saw lots of boxed games. There are lots of magazines in the 'lobby' area & a huge fireplace! The deck at the lodge is a wrap around deck & has homemade chairs & glider. This is a really great place & would be something we would think about next year. Or, any time we want to visit. I think the prices may be lower during the summer months. It seems that this time of year is their peak season in this area because of Christmas at Silver Dollar City. OH! If you stay here, or anywhere in Branson~you have GOT to see The Duttons! I am absolutely NOT into the honky tonk, hillbilly stuff, and the Duttons are quite the opposite! They were in the Top 10 on 'America's Got Talent'. They are so worth seeing! Just a suggestion!

I have to say- pay the extra for the lake view! My kids fished every day and they just had to walk five minutes to get to the lake. We had two whirlpool tubs, though definitely didn't have enough hot water to fill two tubs- barely enough for one really, but that was minor. Both of the rooms had king beds, which I wasn't expecting, so that was an added bonus. The condo was very well stocked, the only thing we didn't have was paper products: foil, plastic wrap, etc. otherwise it was all furnished. We did bring our own laundry soap, thankfully. You have to wash your own towels as they only furnish one set and if you want more clean towels you pay extra, so if you don't like doing laundry while on vacation, you won't like this. In fact, there is no housekeeping while you are there but I was actually glad not to have a housekeeper in our room while we weren't there. But this is why I gave a little bit lower score on service as basically there isn't any while you are there aside from the very nice lady who works at the desk and they are only open from 9-5. They did leave our room key on the door as promised so that was great. We never could get the free wifi to work there, but that's ok.

From reading the reviews, it is apparent that the quality of one's stay at this establishment depends much on the condo you are assigned. The condo we were placed in from September 30-October 3 was very cozy (smaller than I expected), but also full of rustic charm that helped make our trip relaxing and enjoyable. The views from building 7 are absolutely gorgeous. The only bad thing about the view from the top floor is that there are 22-31 stairs to climb, depending on where you enter from. Everything in our child-friendly condo was very clean, and there were not too many things my 9 month old or 2 year old could get into and destroy. The kitchen had every utensil we needed, and there was plenty of HOT water. The pool is small, but there was never anyone else in it while we were swimming, and the wading pool was perfect for my 2 year old. There is also a small playground, but there are only swings and a 'tree-house' of sorts to climb into, so it will not hold a toddler's interest for as long as hunting for acorns to throw to squirrels along the nature trails. The office is only open from 9am to 5pm, which is inconvenient if you need anything after office hours, but I was only disappointed that my husband and son didn't get to experience the atmosphere of all the mounted wildlife around the massive stone fireplace that I was able to glance at during check-in. Since we don't have a boat, and swimming in lake water isn't appealing to us, we didn't mind that there is no place to dock or better lake access for swimming.

We brought a few of our own items along and found they were already supplied in the condo.

One big plus is that when you want to head to Silver Dollar City, you've got a straight easy shot. Most of the traffic is backed up coming into the Park from route 76, but since the Village is on the opposite side of the park from Rt. 76, you avoid all of that 76 traffic. We booked Dixie Stampede tickets through the Village more than a month before we arrived expecting to get a late afternoon (5-ish) show, then got a phone call from the Village a day before our departure telling us that the seating we wanted was booked up. So calling early doesn't mean the Village will book your tickets early. In general, we would recommend buying tickets to anything in Branson AFTER you get there. There are discounts available all over town that are no better than discounts available from the Village. Also, this gives you more opportunity for spontaneous decisions/opportunities on what to see and do.

The buildings are like fancy log homes. The condo decorations were very homey and made you feel so comfortable. Choose a condo with a lake view; it would be worth the wait. When we first arrived, we didn't want to leave our condo because it was so nice, so we went and bought groceries so we could eat at the condo instead of at a restaurant. The condo was immaculate, and the king-sized beds were comfortable and cute (they were 4-poster wrought-iron beds). The only problem we had was that the fireplace didn't work too well, but other than that, the rest of the condo stay was incredible. Would highly recommend this place. We had found it on the internet, and were so incredibly surprised when we actually saw it; surpassed our expectations. The location is only 5 minutes from Silver-Dollar City, yet is in a peaceful spot. They have a private dock where you can enjoy the lake and peacefulness. The package deals were handy; you could purcase Silver Dillar City and other shows at discount prices right at the reservation desk of the condos. Our young family also enjoyed the condos, and had plenty of space for a large family. The pool was mostly 3 1/2 feet - 5 feet in depth so best for older kids, but they did have a baby pool for very young kids.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joplin, MO", "Title": "\u201cGood place to stay\u201d", "Author": "sinderella80", "ReviewID": "UR56688807", "Content": "My husband & I stayed at the Village with our 3 children to celebrate our anniversary.
