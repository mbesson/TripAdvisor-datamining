I don't make that statement lightly. The genuine warmth here surpassed the treatment in the Royal Suite of a prominent cruise line, and the high roller suite at one of the most luxuriant hotels in Vegas. I kid you not. Our flight arrived late at night, but Theo was there in minites with the shuttle to pick us up. His conversation was friendly and upbeat without being intrusive. In short, he made us smile after a long and tiring flight. When we pulled up to the hotel, Dan was waiting outside to greet the shuttle and see us inside. While checking in, he got us some ice cold bottles of water, while Theo was offering everything he could think of to make our stay more comfortable. We felt like royalty! With snack bags that they gave us in hand, we headed to our room, where we found two more bottles of water and a Twix bar set out for us. The next morning Trish at the front desk had the same friendly and helpful attitude, so I know this must be fostered by the management among all employees. Kudos to GM Gary Bowers for encouraging staff to go above and beyond. This hotel gets that it only takes small investments of amenities, provided with a genuine friendly smile, to completely turn a guest's day around and create lifelong fans. As for the room, it was spotlessly clean, completely noise-free, and with more bath amenities than other Hamptons. The only thing it lacked was a microwave, but I'm willing to bet they would have brought one from home if necessary to make us happy. =)", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAn amazing stay!\u201d", "Author": "follyfx", "ReviewID": "UR127198115", "Content": "In Tempe for Spring Training (our first time) and picked this hotel for its nearness to Diablo Stadium - we could have walked there.

The cleanliness of the hotel and attentiveness of the staff was great! Unfortunately, the breakfast was below standards usually seen at the Hampton Inn. The eggs were very dry, the sausage patties were cold and there was absolutely no coffee... NO COFFEE?? That's right, coffee was not available until after I had already finished my meal. I would have thought someone would have had extra coffee going. We ate at 8AM and there was 1 other person eating breakfast so it wasn't like it was crowded. The prior evening, the desk clerk reserved the 10AM shuttle to the airport. This would have given us ample time to catch our 12:00PM flight without any stress. Much to my surprise, as it was Christmas day, the shuttle driver was not working and the Inn used an outside company for shuttle service. My wife and I went downstairs at 9:40AM. The clerk immediately asked for my family name. I told him the name and he confirmed we were on the 10AM shuttle for the airport. At 10AM, the contract shuttle had not yet arrived. The clerk called the vendor / contract shuttle who advised they were on the way. By 10:15AM, the shuttle had still failed to arrive. I inquired with the desk clerk about the shuttle and he again called the contract company who said the driver would arrive momentarily. By 10:30AM the shuttle driver finally arrived. He did not handle our bags and walked inside to use the restroom! We were in a hurry, he was 30 minutes late and now he was taking a restroom break??? Unacceptable!!! We finally got into the shuttle van and arrived at the airport at 10:40AM. My flight was to depart at noon and was boarding at 11:30AM. My wife was extremely stressed out and after checking in and going through security, It was 11:15. While we still had enough time to catch our flight, the stress we hoped to avoid by staying at the Hampton Inn was ever present. It was not a good beginning to the holiday vacation. One of my biggest complaints was that there was a maintenance man speaking to us at the hotel while the front desk clerk called the shuttle company. Why one of them couldn't take the shuttle van parked just outside of the door, is beyond me. I felt that there should have been a backup plan, should the contract company not arrive. We didn't miss our flight, but I was sadly disappointed by the service provided by this Hampton Inn. I must commend the staff, as they were friendly and helpful, they just seemed unsure of what to do when the shuttle didn't arrive. I almost left and parked myself (which would have been counter productive, as the entire reason I booked the hotel was for the parking.) The inn was extremely clean and I was impressed by the wonderful rooms. I just wish the breakfast staff would have ensured the food was prepared better and that the shuttle situation would have been resolved to my satisfaction.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SE, AZ", "Title": "\u201cExceptional value\u201d", "Author": "ind_sub", "ReviewID": "UR122070861", "Content": "We needed a place to unwind for two nights and this was our choice.

The suite is definately worth the price as the room is huge with a couch, several chairs, desk, bar area, etc. The bathroom was plenty big too. Everything was clean. If you reserve online, make sure you request a pool side view. The other side of the building is just parking lot, and not much to look at. The front desk person said they went through a major rennovation this year and are going to do the outside next year (2012). The staff were all very friendly. The breakfast in the morning was good. Nothing super fancy or crazy, but they had eggs, sausage, home fries, warm oatmeal, make your own waffles, etc. The pool area and jacuzzi were good. They even had towels out there. The airport shuttle was wonderful and very timely. Occassionally we could hear a plane way off in the distance, but overall it was very quiet. Not sure if we just didn't have anyone around us, but it was incredibly quiet. I am sure that someone who is extremely picky would find things wrong with this place. It is kind of set on a corner by a gas station right off the freeway. So, it's not in a 'fluffy' location, but it is nice, it's clean and we never once felt unsafe.

There were no surprises except one -- I booked a non-smoking room and although it was labeled as such on the door, it was obvious it had recently been a smoking room (it smelled like such). The location is in excellent reach of the airport, and parking is available and free. I had no problems getting anything I needed and the buffet breakfast was not bad.

We had used mapquest to find it , and the route they told us to take made no sense at all until we arrived there.
