The rooms have a contemporary look and feel but still manage to maintain a 'homely' feel. The air conditioning unit in the room was great, at night time having set it to the lowest fan speed, it made very little noise. I did not find the bed overly comfortable and had trouble sleeping. Despite the size, the room did not have a great layout, where the placement for luggage storage was at the foot of the bed and gave little walk-way space. A safe is provided in the room and the area to hang clothes is basic.

A favorite feature was the deep bathtub where my friend took a comfortable and leisurely bath. I can vouch for the shower which had great pressure,quick hot water and didn't get water on the floor, possibly because of the deep tub. The bathroom was very clean. One thing to look out for is the door stop for the bathroom door which is a round metal cylinder located right in front of the toilet. It is easy to stub your toes on it. In fact my friend did that.

Other than that, nothing to recommend. Examples: Built in the 1970's during the Novotel \"concept\". Personally, I am tired of the extensive use of reds, oranges and burnt browns. Except for missing the green shag carpets - well suited to people of an \"Elvis\" flavor. Little to no sound-proofing. Internet is 3MB TOTAL shared among 150 rooms on a less than robust tertiary line per the ISP (N2S , Power2Hotel). Restaurant closes on two days at a time with little to no warning. Dinner does not open until 7:30. The shopping district is NOT within walking distance if you have to carry anything back. Staff member recommended going to the City Center on Sunday - forgetting to mention that he was there the day before and had to return home because of no parking. That was quite a frustrating 2 hour FUBAR for me that could have been avoided. The hotel HVAC is mostly out of service. Cold on one side ofthe hotel, hot on the other. The controls on the wall are dummies - only control a fan motor (when it works). Mold in the bathrooms around the tubs, etc. Yuck! No fitness center. Near impossible parking AT hotel. My E320 Mercedes barely made the corners into the garage (3\" max to spare on each side). The primary entrance to the garage is a one lane channel. Constantly had to back-up or wait for the other party to get in or out. Just across from the regional hospital - with cars everywhere parked. There was no street with two usable lanes - cars simply parked whereever they wanted to. Hotel street deadends - and there is some interesting graffitti if you are into that sort of art (not what I like to look at from my hotel window, however).", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nice", "Title": "\u201cGreat business hotel in Sanchinarro / Las Tablas area of Madrid\u201d", "Author": "CarynWaller", "ReviewID": "UR36243373", "Content": "I stay here regularly on business as it is conveniently located for both my companies Madrid offices as well as our clients.

We know Madrid very well so we did not really need to stay in a more central place. If you are a tourist traveller visiting Madrid for the first time, this hotel is not for you. Although it is close to Chamartin, it is a bit tricky to get there without a car but there are plenty of buses to the main metro stations, so it is fairly convenient anyway. This hotel is a typical new, modern Novotel, with Novation rooms and design. No fantasy, but good and efficient design and comfortable overall with nice materials. There is a small pool and a beautiful outside terrace which is great for evening drinks. Armchairs abd lightnings were great. Breakfast was horrible (and really on the pricey side), so I would not recommend it to anyone. First, since they have good deals for the week end, the hotel is filled with noisy families travelling by bus who regard the breakfast room as a playground, which makes eating here a very unpleasant experience. The selection of items is rather poor (I am used to better breakfasts at Novotel) with hardly any refills in case you arrive late. Eventually, due to the lack of staff, there was only one waitress there, which means she hardly could clean tables and refill food at the same time (took ages to get what we wanted).

The hotel is new, so is all neat, clean and comfortable. The design is anonymous modernity that could be in any city; once inside, only the language reminds you that you are actually in Spain. Everything seemed overpriced, from the pay TV to the (certainly quite nice) meals in the restaurant. Breakfast was excellent, but they do charge you for it. The staff were helpful and they all spoke very good English. Outside the hotel you find modern Madrid at its worst - freeways, building sites, office blocks that, again, look like every other city's modern office blocks. There is no metro station nearby. It cost me 9 euros by taxi to get to the centre of the city. Sanchinarro is clearly an office/industrial zone and not a residential area, let alone an entertainment precinct. The room seemed to me to be of a good size, and my air-conditioning did work. You will need the aircon; opening the window would let in the noise from the freeway outside.

The hotel is very new and from the outside looks quite impressive. The rooms are clean and I must admit quite comfortable although there is very little wardrobe space and no drawers at all. The TV offers very limited English language viewing and movies are available in the room for a staggering \u20ac15 per film. The air conditioning in the hotel is certainly of poor quality and during my stay complained many times about the high temperature. I was shown another three rooms and in each room the air conditioning was also not working. The only solution for a comfortable night was to open the window the small amount it is able but results in a every early awakening by the refuse collectors who seem to make as much noise as they possibly can!!! The hotel restaraunt although does indeed look good does not offer a varied menu and is not very good value at the prices charged. That may explain why nobody was using it. The hotel location is terrible for access into Madrid. There is no Metro train station anywhere near the hotel and bus rides are the only option which can unfortunately take forever during the rush hour when the roads are very busy. Taxi's are available but again quite expensive and the drivers tend to speak very little English. Walking around the Sanchinarro area is a complete waste of time as all that you can see are building sites where you tend to get completely covered in mud or the local superstore. There are no other dining facilities or bars in the vacinity of the hotel and so the nights can be long and boring unless travel is made into Madrid itself. Finally, the hotel told me the room rate was \u20ac79 per night which I though was very expensive given the lack of facilities and small room size. Upon checking out I was informed that the rate had changed to \u20ac119 and there was nothing I could do about it. The manageress had a very couldn\u00b4t care less attitude when I questioned this sudden increase and offered no solution or discount. The hotel has no competition in the area at present and so I guess feel they can do and charge whatever they like.
