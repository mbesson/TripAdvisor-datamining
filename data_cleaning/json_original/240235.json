Turned out to be a good idea. The Quality Inn across the street from the Daytona Speedway is a fairly new, very nice hotel. The lobby immediately welcomes you. It is very boutique or designer for lack of a better word. The first of many pleasant surprises. While the rooms were very comfortable and the area safe and surrounded by lots of good restaurants, the two most pleasant surprises were two of your staff members. Amanda, the first person we talked with at check in, was so involved in the hotel. Her pride in this facility really came shining through just chatting with her. We automatically knew this was where we would be staying. She helped us with so many things effortlessly. Lynn we met the following morning. She is in charge of the buffet breakfast area. She is such a warm person and she keeps this area immaculately clean. Once again, her pride of this hotel really came shining through. It was almost like staying with family.

This visit was as good or better than the first. The hotel is great, rooms are large and have all the items needed for a good stay - great beds, good internet service, microwave, refrigerator, hairdryer, coffee maker, and a good breakfast. But I feel what makes this hotel more special than most are the people, they have a new General Manager, Deborah Bailey who is warm and friendly, the front desk staff that I met, Wil, Amanda and Angela were delightful. They were always visible, smiling and ready to help. The hotel is directly across from the Daytona International Speedway, I think you will like this hotel.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hialeah, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Staff, great facilites!\u201d", "Author": "harrynmione", "ReviewID": "UR119017476", "Content": "This place is the best value for your money.

I was among the large group of people from Continental Tire that stayed at your hotel January 24th \u2013 January 31st, 2011, wanted to take the time to thank you for everything. Wow! What a weekend! Wanted to let you guys know what a great job you did on the 24hour hotel stay accommodations. I have no doubt, you've had lots of experience planning of these events, but it was more than I had imagined. The attention to detail was evidenced by the smoothness of the whole operation. Your wonderful staff helped to make everything go perfect for us. Our crew of fifty people arrive on Friday the 28th and we had them (with your staffs help), checked into the hotel, supplies in hand and off to their rooms in right around a half hour or so. (I\u2019ve had longer check in times when I\u2019ve been traveling alone). We then provided a meal for our crew Friday night, once again every one of the staff members went beyond the call of duty to make sure things rolled perfect for us. And they did. Also, I don\u2019t know if you have a connection with the weather people, but the weather was perfect!!! Great, great, great! Definitely hope to stay with you again. Thanks again for everything.

From the time we checked in with Rita-Patricia, at the front desk, we knew we would be having a wonderful stay.She was very informative and knowledgable about both the hotel, as well as the attractions in the area.We personally followed her suggestion to visit St. Augustine, and were so glad we did. The entrance had such a nice feel to it, sort of like a coffee-shop bistro for vacationers and businessmen alike. After our wonderful conversation with Rita-Patricia, we went to put our things in the room.I expected the room to be comfortable from the initial welcoming, but it far exceeded my expectations. Not only was the room clean, it was so maticulously organized and set up with beautiful furnature and decor, that i was hesitant in placing my things inside.My compliments to the manager, as well as the maids, for they have truly outdone themselves. We opted for the room with the king-size bed, that was inclusive of a down comforter, and the room had a fridge as well as an iron and microwave.A vanity area served as the entryway to the restroom, hairdryer included.there was a desk near the bed for my laptop, as well as the included wi-fi connection.The room was superb. The next morning after our visit to St.Augustine, our requested wake- up call was friendly and prompt.I thanked RIta-Patricia for the call, and she reminded us of the hours in which they serve breakfast. As my girlfriend prepared for our departure, I went to have some breakfast.Now, usually I end up at a hotel breakfast and they are all the same.Free continental breakfast usually amounts to come have a donut, but this was not the case.The coffee was fresh, there were donuts, but also bagels,orange juice,boiled eggs, breads,even a waffle maker.The food was prepared and set out by Iris, and she was very pleasant to talk to to.Originally I had just decided on a Bagel and coffee, but she quickly convinced me of a waffle, fresh from the iron.She even cooked it for me, even though it was nearing closing of the breakfast area.Now that may not sound like much, but bear in mind it was a self- service kitchen.And I found the gesture to be very sweet of her.We had a nice little chat as she was cleaning up and i thanked her for everything. After this we checked out, even though we wished we could have stayed.I had to write this review, hoping to give credit where credit was certainly due.I will definitely be staying there again, hopefully soon.Even though we were there for only a night, I am a firm believer that when things go so well, that the memories of a perfect vacation getaway can last a lifetime.

We drove almost 11 hours at night on Wednesday for a early Thursday check-in. We arrived @ 6:15AM and were told by the rude night manager that we could not check-in until 2:00PM - no exceptions. We waited until 7:00AM when the office opened and were greeted by a very nice young man that told us we could check-in immediately. Go figure!! We actually came to Daytona for a Annual Car Show that is held at the Speedway and for a nice relaxing Thansgiving. We were very disappointed that our $150.00 a night room was in the shape that it was in. No small refrigerator, no iron, no towels, no hand soap, etc. After asking for towels we received 2 bath towels, 1 bath mat and no wash cloths. You would have expected that if 4 people are in a room, more towels would have been given. The hotel itself must not be very sound proof, because there was conversation outside our room that we could hear every word. On our second day there we were greeted bright and early by a maid that was probably the rudest that I have ever seen. She was very upset that the one towel that we were given was being used to dry off our show car. Mind you, this car had no dirt, or grime on it. As a matter of fact we washed and waxed it, at a car wash off the hotel premises just the morning before. The towels were jerked from my friends hand and we were told that we were the most inconsiderate people she had ever met. Mind you, this towel was not a top of the line towel to begin with. I'm sure it is a challenge to keep up with these due to theft and ignorance from other patrons but we are not children. I think this could have been handled in a much better fashion. Our next request for towels, we received 4 bath mats to dry off on. Was told by the manager that this was all they had left. Again you would think that our room would have been fully stocked with towels for 4 adults. The parking was a nightmare each evening. Patrons that had driven car haulers were allowed to park their trucks anywhere. Most of them took up at least 5 or 6 spaces. This left no spaces for the guests to park.
