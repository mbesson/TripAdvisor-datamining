His suggestion was based on location. For the first time in recent years I did not check the reviews on Tripadvisor before booking. I should have known better and will not repeat my mistake. The Arcadia hotel is indeed well placed for the attractions of the old part of the city of Istanbul. If you pay for a room on one of the higher floors you do get a good view - some rooms are corner \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and you can see the Bosphorus as well as the Blue Mosque so without leaving your room you can enjoy the sights and sounds of the city and take in some splendid sunrises and sunsets. The downsides of this rather dowdy hotel remain much the same as reported in an earlier review. It looks much better from the outside. Our welcome tray contained one tea bag and one sachet of three in one coffee - milk powder and sugar already added. The room we had was looking a little worn with several areas of badly chipped veneer on the furniture tops. We had a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prototype\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bed that the hotel was apparently trying out which was fine. There is no central light, just two bedside lamps and a standard lamp. There are no other electrical plugs apart from these so to charge any batteries/laptops etc you have to do so without lights or overnight. As the room electricity cuts out when you remove the key it is not possible to leave anything on charge while you go out during the day. The bathroom was definitely in need of upgrading with a detachable spray shower head over the bath. No plugs in either the sink or the bath still. Fire escapes (to an exterior metal spiral staircase) on several levels remain either propped open to the outside air or obstructed with furniture / hoovers etc. The Reception staff are pleasant and helpful. I was surprised to see a Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence on the desk however. Our main complaint was the breakfast. This is served on the roof which sounds lovely and indeed it should be. We ate there on the first morning only. The atmosphere is unpleasant. There is a lot of heavy duty plastic sheeting in use, presumably to cut down wind but it looks awful. More awful than that though was the coffee - instant and with milk already added - from a push button machine. All coffees seemed to come with a head of froth, even the black \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americano\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd type and were very unpleasant. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orange juice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was worse. It was orange in colour and any resemblance to the fruit juice ended there. That too came out of a machine. There were piles of unwashed dirty plates lying around. The open buffet did not look particularly fresh or appetising to us although to be fair other people seemed to be happy to eat it. The waitress was grumpy and the waiter was eating his own breakfast standing in the kitchen. We never go to Starbucks when at home in the UK but we went just down the street and had good coffee and juice there each morning for breakfast for the rest of our stay. We did report our dissatisfaction with breakfast to Reception on day one and asked if we could stay on a room only basis. We had paid in full on arrival which is hotel policy and our request was refused. We paid 1700 turkish lira for a four night stay so roughly \u00c2\u00a3620 UK pounds - really not good value for money in my opinion so please do your pre-trip homework and find somewhere better for the price if you can.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Osaka, Japan", "Title": "\u201cReceptionist was warned against cheating me of 60 TL by the Tourist Police.\u201d", "Author": "Fumcoat", "ReviewID": "UR115960360", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights at a corner deluxe in early June and we satisfy the location, view, a quiet room and several nice staffs at roof top restaurant & front desk, off course. But a bell boy, Almid at evening to midnight & a receptionist Numan at morning cheated us of 60 TL (= 30 euro) for shared-ride airport shuttle bus from the hotel. According to the Tourist Police we asked later on, normal price to go to the Ataturk airport from old city by taxi is 32-37 TL (=16-19 euro). Why I cheated by them so easily is I didn't know the right price of Hotel Arcadia's pick-up service because airport pick-up service on arrival day was free (included room fee). The bell boy Almid came close to me & offered a shared-ride shuttle bus service which is managed by his friend when I went down to the front desk to ask airport shuttle bus. \"I give you Discount Price, 50 TL for two person. My friend's company. Don't you mind it goes around other hotels to pick guests up?\" He said. I said \"No problem. And I don't like discount price & poor service. So you show me normal price of it.\" Then Almid offered me 60 TL and I paid it. He gave me a receipt for that. Why I didn't say \"No, thank you\" to his offer is that I didn't trust Hotel Arcadia's pick-up service. The airport pick-up car arranged by Hotel Arcadia didn't show in front of the arrival when we arrived the airport so that we walked up slope to the parking pushing heavy luggage cart. Even we couldn't get one euro deposit back for the cart when we reached parking building. The driver didn't care about the cart & deposit, only said \"I don't know. Leave it!!\" when I asked how to get back deposit at the parking. Then that midnight, I found that the price for shuttle bus from Sultanahmed to the Ataturk airport is from 10TL (=5 euro) on my guidebook. Next morning I asked Numan, a receptionist, the price for shuttle service for hotel guests. He immediately answered \"30 euro\". I decided not to trust these two men. I arranged way to go to airport & place to leave luggage at nearby hotel by myself, then told Numan to cancel the shuttle bus pick-up. He refused paying money back as I expected. So my husband & me finished claiming him and left the front desk for visiting the Toulist Police & sightseeing keeping the receipt for 60 TL in my hand. Then Numan asked me \"Are you going to the travel agent?\" watching the receipt I had. \"No\" I said. But when we'd just got out, we hear a bell boy (not Almid) screaming \"Madame, madame, come back! He is calling you! Come back!!!\". As I reluctantly go back to the front desk, Numan suddenly told me \"I pay back from my own money. So give the receipt.\" \"Why?\" \"I have to call the agent for cancel.\" We lost the receipt but a officer of the Tourist Police understood and believed me. As soon as the officer finished listening to my report, he told me \"I warned them now.\" He called Hotel Arcadia and warned Numan. According to the officer, Numan said \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" again & again. While I was reporting to the officer, he said to me \"Arcadia is a classed hotel. Shouldn't!\" I agree with the officer.

Despite unrelated persons sharing rooms, the hotel inconveniently refused to give more than one plastic key per room claiming that they did not have enough blanks and the keys kept needing to be reprogrammed as they often did not work. The breakfasts were good and the view unsurpassed. Unfortunately those were the best features of the hotel. The staff was unfriendly and the rooms needed maintenance badly. The air conditioning (in 90-100 degree weather) did not work, it just ,suffocatingly, blew hot air around and I was told that they cut it off in the night as an energy saving measure. Despite filling out forms and making requests at the desk nothing was done to fix it or to replace the broken hair dryer during our 5 night stay. Door locks and windows broke. The beds were lumpy and needed new mattresses. The rooms were very small with no place for luggage, and the towels were worn and like sandpaper. There was no soap for the shower and only liquid foam soap on the wall at the sink. The group elected to have dinner there one night and it was the most expensive and worst dinner of our stay in Istanbul.

It was prepaid in the hybrid tour (hybrid = tour guided plus self navigated) package, therefore I cannot reflect on bang-for-the-buck since I do not know the cost. We stayed there at the beginning of our tour, then again, towards the culmination of our visit - a total of six nights. As already reviewed elsewhere, the location is about a hundred steps off the main drag in Sultanhamet; very quiet and yet amenable to most Sultanhamet tourist sites touted by the Turkish travel bureau. Yes, one can easily walk to most of the sites. Upon arrival we were allocated a Corner room on the 5th floor. Corner rooms, are typically slightly larger and afford a better view. So, this was no exception. What irked me, though, was that upon return at the end of our 2-week stint in Turkey, we were unable to get a corner room, thus ending up in a slightly smaller abode. Since booking had been made in advance for both stays before and after the tour I feel the hotel owed an obligation to afford us the same amenity throughout. Just my thought. Must say the staff was extremely polite and professional. That includes restaurant staff at the glass-encased rooftop. So much so that the restaurant obliged us by refrigerating a can of caviar we had purchased (big bucks!) at the Spice Bazaar upon arrival. That 'extra' was highly appreciated. Befriended the restaurant manager. As he got familiar with our eating habbits he suggested a Special that was not on the menu. Turned out to be a large plate consisting of most of the appetizer menu offerings. Variety!! Total cost per plate was much less than the sum of each appetizer, when ordered individually. Rest of the staff was equally friendly. Unexpected? No. Turkish people, by nature are friendly and it is a visitor's duty to reciprocate. Summarizing hotel amenities: everything, viz service, pillows, mattresses, towels, general upkeep, etc. was OK. Hotel classes itself as a Boutique. I do not know the exact implication, having seen the best and the worst around the world. Could be a category relative to its surroundings. While I found nothing extraordinary I could classify this place as being in the Median by Western standards. An observation, especially useful to first-time visitors to Turkey: a) The upper-deck restaurant seems to be taller than surrounding buidings, with a very clear and commanding view of the lighted (at night) Blue Mosque; b) Fifteen steps right-wards from the Main entrance, in the opposite direction of the main, tourist-full street is a back alley that serves quite a different experience when headed to the Spice Bazaar or the boats. Should you return by this back street one can stop at either of the two tiny open air (clean) shacks for a refreshing yogurt drink. These two stores are located right-hand-side, at the beginning of the street when headed out of the hotel.. Conversely, they are on your left before the final right turn into the street where the hotel is located a fraction of a block away. Wi-fi is weak but hotel computers are available for the price of a smile. Would we stay there again? Yes, depending on the room rate :) BTW: 1. The $10 Garmin software for Turkey proved helpful in navigating our walks. 2. While smoking is prohibited in all Turkey hotels, the upper-deck restaurant has a dedicated, heated (if cold) section for smokers such as myself. In fact, this section offers a better overall view of Sultanhamet and the Bosphorus!

In fact, we found Arcadia, a four star Hotel to be better than the previous one. It is located close to the famous Blue mosque & other attractions . Good, airy, fairly big rooms with high quality bath room & good view. The staff was efficient & friendly. Breakfast was reasonable, probably a minus point for this otherwise a good hotel. Thje hotel is close to the market where many restaurants providing variety of food are available. Local train station, preferable mode of commuting & bus stops are with in 100 m from the hotel. Taxis can be easily hailed. The Hotel also organised a good Hamam for us.

She felt uncomfortable, but she didn't tell us immediately, because she didn't know if it was normal in Turkey! \"Sexual harassment!\" She said. What a pity! A good hotel with a bad service.

The location is fantastic, the hotel was clean and tidy and nicely decorated. The staff were friendly and helpful and the level of English was sufficient at all times. The views from the rooms on the front of the hotel and from the rooftop breakfast room and the terrace are amazing - pretty much 360 degree view of the city, with the Blue Mosque and the Agha Sofia front and centre! Picture perfect! Location-wise, it's a five minute walk to the Blue Mosque, Agha Sofia, Basilica Cistern. It's 10-15 minutes walk to Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, Eminonu and Galati Bridge. The tram that runs across the Galati Bridge stops at the top of the street, a couple of minutes away. Yet the hotel itself is on a quiet street set back from the hustle and bustle. This location is perfect for your stay in Istanbul if you're looking to stay in Sultanahmet. The only negatives I would mention is that the room I stayed in, which was a single, was tiny even by European standards. It didn't bother me too much as I was only wanted a room to sleep but some people may have a problem with that. Also, while my room was cleaned each day, it was terribly thorough - for example when I had a drink, the glass and empty bottle were not cleared away, eventhough the rest of the room and bathroom was cleaned. A very minor thing, but noticeable nonetheless. Overall, this is a nice hotel in an excellent location and I found it to be really good value for money. It made our visit to Istanbul so easy and enjoyable.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cFine Hotel in a Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "mydogwrigley", "ReviewID": "UR24628326", "Content": "I was a group leader for 22 people that stayed at the Arcadia Hotel in January 2009. My group was made up mostly of very well traveled people that average 35 years of age. We were booked through our tour operator so I had no direct dealings with the hotel prior to our arrival. We were originally booked at the Armada Hotel but they closed down for some renovations and we were switched to the Arcadia Hotel. I was initially a little concerned about this hotel when I read some reviews on Tripadvisor.com. A few reviews stated that this hotel was not clean and the staff was unfriendly. But, I am very happy to say that my group's experience couldn't have been better! The location was perfect. You are in the heart of everything and just steps away from all of the major sights. The group was spread out on floors 4, 5,6 & 7. All of our rooms had a spectacular view of the Blue Mosque....so be sure to ask for a room facing the blue mosque. Their dining room/bar is on the top floor and has even better views of the Blue Mosque and surrounding area. It was great to have our breakfast looking out over the blue mosque and have a drink before heading out to dinner and seeing it again at night. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful. As a group leader I had to deal with them several times during our three day stay. The rooms and bathroom sizes were a nice size...not huge, but plenty of room to move around comfortably. They were comfortably decorated and the showers were strong and as hot as you wanted. Breakfast was a nice Turkish buffet breakfast. It had a good assortment of breads, cereals and veggies. The breakfast wasn't spectacular, but my group liked what they served and was more than satisfied. The hotel does have a computer with free internet. My tripmates said it was a bit slow...But hey, it was free! I had my own laptop and just used their free wireless internet in my room which worked out well. The hotel is located on a quiet side street so we heard no noise at night. You can hear the call to prayer at 5:30am, but the hotel was insulated enough that it wasn't loud enough to wake any of us up. I was fortunate to stay in one of the corner rooms which are much larger than their regular rooms. As the group leader during the slow season, I wasn't charged extra for this room so I don't know if the hotel charges more for a corner room or not. The corner rooms are quite large and have a nice seating area. The couches in the seating area were a bit tired, but I didn't go to Istanbul to spend time on the couch! If you can get a corner room and it doesn't cost too much more then you will be very happy with choice to upgrade. I give this hotel a solid 4 star rating based on my group's experience. I usually don't give a 4 star hotel a 5 star rating since I usually reserve this for 5 star hotels. So, If you want a very good hotel in a great location then the Hotel Arcadia would be a great place to hang your hat.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "kukula", "ReviewID": "UR20180343", "Content": "This is a great value for the location.

They referred us to this horrible fish restaurant on the gellata bridge, where we were sarrounded by other americans and the fish was terrbile. The bill came out to about ~ 200 YTL.
