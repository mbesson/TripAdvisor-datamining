Great rooms, if you can try to get a room on the fifth floor with a balcony - excellent views of the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. But but but, it's all politics with this hotel. Initially we stayed in June for 2 nights and clearly our tour operator pulled in a few favours and we had great accommodation which was instrumental in us booking our final 3 nights in Turkey at this hotel. However for this last stay, my 3 children were squashed into a room that in reality was barely a double room. The room I had with my husband had clearly been the venue for some or other cigar/chain-smoking party with the obligatory cherry pips still lying on the carpeted floor. According to the receptionist there were no rooms available for us to move. However the next morning miraculously a room (albeit a single room into which we squashed ourselves) appeared after I had expressed my outrage sufficienty (holidaying in Turkey is NOT relaxing as the entire trip is constantly up for negotiation despite having paid a tour operator copious amounts of money for a fully inclusive tour in the hope that one would be left in peace). Anyhow, with the move to the other room I left some of my cosmetics in the previous room - oh dear, \"we simply can't find your items - perhaps the next guest took them\" was how I was dismissed. I wouldn't use the laundry service either as several items of clothing went missing never to be seen again and the shirt of another poor soul was found in my laundry too. Upon making an enquiry at the front desk - \"oh well, nothing to be done, your clothing is probably been worn by some or other Turkish person as we speak\" was the joking comment I received. This kind of nonchalance I find a little out of line. And then to my disgust despite settling our bill for extras upon our departure and having paid the tour operator in full for the accommodation - the And Hotel had the nerve to bill my credit card for a goodly sum too - completely unfounded. Despite all this, the hotel is clean and very well located. Just all the other stuff that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. When I visit Turkey again, will make a point of NOT staying in this hotel purely because of the the sneakiness and slyness that surrounds all their transactions (not only here but I think it's inherent in Turkey - which is a pity as one hesitates to visit again).", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cthe perfect place to be in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "turkeybooster", "ReviewID": "UR114762537", "Content": "A small hotel with fantastic views of Aya Sophia and the Blue Mosque.

The hotel staff also made our stay wonderful as they were courteous, helpful and friendly! They have a rooftop terrace restaurant on the 6th Floor where you can have food and drinks, but it is a little bit pricey. However, you have great panoramic views of the city! We only had drinks up there and it was a nice place to relax after a day of walking around the city in the sun. Our room was a little small but we were told it was because of the balcony we had. It wasn't much of a problem as were are not big people but if we were any taller, I think the space would have been a challenge. But we thought it was worth putting up with the smallness of the room, to be able to see the fantistic view!! Just a tip - We were in room 501 which I think is the smallest of the balcony rooms on Level 5. We used the airport transfer (provided by the hotel) from Ataturk airport, which ended up costing us 30Euros for two people!! Whilst others in our group had used Backpackers which costs 20TL for 4 people!!! We thought that was abit steep! However, when we used airport transfer from the hotel to Ataturk airport, it costs 10TL per person, total 20TL. Just a tip to be aware!", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cIdeal location; wonderful views from balcony\u201d", "Author": "SeafarerRI", "ReviewID": "UR114659105", "Content": "The AND Hotel is a six-story hotel that has been refurbished in the recent past. It's location is its greatest attraction; on a traffic-free side street in the traffic-controlled tourist center of Istanbul. Requesting a room with a panoramic view, such as my wife and I had, on the fifth floor, is the main reason for staying at the AND Hotel. Our room had a balcony that looked directly across at the Aya Sophia museum; built in Byzantine times as an enormous and richly decorated early Christian church, where Byzantine emperors were crowned. It then became the principal and monumental location of the Greek Orthodox church. During that era, exquisite mosaics and murals covered the walls and the dome. It became a mosque in the Islamic era of Istanbul, and is now a museum. Nearby, and very clearly visible from our balcony, was the monumental Sultanahmet (Blue) mosque; with six minarets. Both monuments are beautifully illuminated from dusk to dawn. There is an attractive restaurant and terrace cafe on the sixth floor, with wonderful views. We did not have dinner there, but the cafe service was very good. Our room had a large balcony, but the room itself was very compact; though attractive enough. Staying there for two nights, the room felt cramped; more than two nights might be hard to take; even with the wonderful view from the balcony. The bathroom was new, and the compact shower (no tub) worked quite well. A buffet breakfast is served in the ground floor cafe. It is quite adequate, but not memorable. The hotel staff were helpful and courteous. Our room cost seemed somewhat inflated, given the small size of the room. But the view from the balcony more than compensated.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Napier, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat Views from the Restaurant!\u201d", "Author": "MacDutch", "ReviewID": "UR113261145", "Content": "We were part of a tour group and our stay here was pretty good for the price.
