I checked reviews here, even though I did.n't have a choice in hotels. Here are my comments: 1. Lobby was modern and nicely decorated 2. Free breakfast daily (only meal served in dining room, no room service but delivery from restaurants is available). 3. Front desk staff was pretty nice. 4. Like others mentioned, due to location there are no supermarkets, convenience stores or restaurants close by. A colleague did say there was a small cafe in the business park directly across from the hotel though. There are also no vending machines so if you want to purchase drinks and snacks, there's a selected variety in an area next to the front desk for purchase. 5. Rooms are on the smaller side, but I've actually had worse lol My room had stains on the carpet where you could tell there was an overflow from the bathroom. There is no heat in the room, just A/C. Though it makes sense because of the weather there, it was actually cool at night during our stay in early March and I could've used some heat. Bathroom is decent size, but shower stall is on the smaller side but still workable. And there are no small amenities like lotions, shampoos etc but they do provide a body/hair cleanser in the shower. Bed was super firm, pillows soft and not flat sheet, only comforter. Again, this is probably due to the hot weather, but I did receive a blanket for the cooler nights. 6. There is NO WIFI in the rooms only hardwire, they provide cable. It was reliable and several colleagues had difficulty with connects. The staff worked on it all week with no success. Wifi is available in the lobby but you have to pay for it. 7. They provide shuttle service that leaves at 10:30am and will take you to either the Dubai Mall or the beach. Pickup is at 3:30pm. There are also taxi's available and the metro station is about a 15 min walk.

Internet is quite expensive though, especially if you're staying for several days, but as a Platinum member of Priority Club I got it for free, so I can't complain. Location is good enough. Business Bay metro station looks quite near, but once you get there you must go up, walk to the other side of Sheikh Zayed Road, escalators down, and up again. It never took me less than 10 minutes to reach the platform, but that's not a great problem. As for the hotel, it doesn't stray much from the typical Holiday Inn Express. Breakfast was OK, although with the fair beginning at 11:00 and the breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30, everyone got there at the same time and they couldn't quite handle it.

Breakfast was poor as well, the basic of the basic (OK, I know this is not a 5 star hotel, but as I said, other 2 stars hotels from Dubai offers much more for the same price). Apart from that, staff from restaurant are really slow, either to clean tables or replace food.

That means guests are essentially there on business. There are five essentials to the business traveler: A comfortable room, a work area in the room, tea and coffee making facilities in the room, internet connection and a decent breakfast. Safa Park Holiday Inn Express only managed the first three. The internet was a disaster. First, they charge for it, which as all businessmen know (and almost certainly agree) is a rip-off as it costs an hotel nothing. But I have never staying in a HIE yet where it was charged for in the lobby too. But Safa Park does charge and very largely, it doesn't work. In the room connection has to be by cable and they demand a deposit for it - and then it still doesn't connect. The front desk, after much messing around finally came up with alternative routes to get to a connection, which had to be in the restaurant as it was impossible to balance a laptop on those low couches in the lobby....not impressed. If I have to pay for it at all, then I expect to be able to connect in my room. And breakfast...why only provide hard boiled eggs? The much-advertised free breakfast at HIE includes baked beans, turkey bacon (tasteless, don't know why they can't serve real bacon when most of the kitchen staff are not actually Muslim), and hard boiled eggs! Why can't they make scrambled like other HIE locations? I would rather pay and get the day off to a decent start. Otherwise, it is the usual model for HIE, generally one of my favoured locations because it is reasonably-priced and you know you will get a reasonable sleep and can make tea in your room (powdered milk, unfortunately, but you can usually scrounge some).

It involves the security staff at the front of this hotel who lead guests to private taxis waiting directly outside the hotel. Guests are lied to and told that these taxis cost the same as WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS. This is a lie, these private cabs are much more expensive than WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS. The security staff tolf myself and several other guests that the private cabs are the same cost as WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS, AND THIS IS A LIE. I also heard these unscrupolous security staff telling guests that WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IN THE LOCAL AREA. This again is a lie. I WANT TO WARN ALL GUESTS OF THIS SCAM SO YOU CAN AVOID BEING A VICTIM. MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO FLAG DOWN A WHITE GOVERNMENT CAB OUTSIDE THE HOTEL YOURSELF. THEY ARE READILY AVAILABLE WITHIN A COUPLE OF MINS AT THE ROADSIDE. ONLY GOVERNMENT CABS ARE WHITE SO STICK WITH WHITE CABS THROUGHOUT YOUR STAY. I saw the secutiy staff making a note every time they managed to get a guset into a private cab. My hypothesis is that the security staff are receiving a commission from their \"friends\" driving these pricate cabs. REMEMBER PRIVATE CABS ARE NOT WHITE. I informed the hotel manager of these issues on 20/11/2011 and he said this problem would be addressed that night. So i was shocked to observe that on the following day the SCAM was continuing. I managed to advise a few guests who were angry and shocked and decided to take government cabs. REMEMBER FOR CHEAP TRANSPORT USE WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS OR THE EXCELLENT METRO SYSTEM. HOLIDAY INN SENIOR MANAGEMENT YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE ABOVE EFFICIENTLY. I would have given this hotel four out of five but due to the avove issue i have had to mark it down. In terms of my stay the hotel maids on my floor and receptionists were good overall. Check in could have been quicker when i arrived at the hotel at 3am, the reception staff prioritised answering the phone than dealing with checking me in when i was tired from a long flight. After this they were much better and helpful throughout my stay. The maids who cleaned our room were good overall. However, when i inspected my room closely i found a plastic bag behind the sofa and a lot of dust behind and under the bed. Also my sheets were not changed sometimes when they needed changing. But again i would stay that aside from these issues the maids were friendly and good at maing up our room. The hotel is in a quiet location but close to majot landmarks and an excellent metro system.

Took 15mins to arrive from airport costing 50aed as get charged extra from airport automatically and was night rate after 10pm. Going back to airport was only 30aed as was day and no airport charge. Final words. Hotel in good location. Mid point to Dubai city centre and the palm jumeriah. Staff at hotel were great. Friendly and helpful.

First of all, I\u2019ll say there were no major problems. My complaints were: 1. As another reviewer said, the room was musty and damp which was immediately noticeable but that I thought the aircon would dry out. I complained after the first night and both the housekeeping manager and an engineer quickly identified the problem as a water leak. This was obviously not new (from the bubbled paint) and so I fault them for continuing to use the room. 2. The room I was moved to wasn\u2019t damp but the internet didn\u2019t work. Of course they told me it was my laptop but was finally moved to my third room where everything seemed okay. 3. The aircon worked but not well, and this was only April! 4. Message button on the phone didn\u2019t work and when I called the front desk to get my message, the receptionist said it was a missed call. However, my friend later said she definitely had left a message. 5. Clothes line in the shower was broken.

No bar soap, only liquid, in the bathroom. No washcloths either. 3. Hallway noise was very noticeable. Noise from outside was not bad at all. 4. The dirt-hiding color scheme in the room is really depressing. What did I like? The price. Also, most of the staff were professional, courteous, and interested in making my stay pleasant. I would prefer to be closer to the creek, but the location will be good if you plan to spend a lot of time at the beach or Dubai Mall (and Burj Khalifa).

We didn't go to Dubai for the beach (coming from South Africa) of for a hotel spa experience - so for us this hotel was perfect for what we were looking for. Everyone was so friendly and corteous. They went out of there way to assist in any way. Rooms are fresh, clean, large and as modern as necessary. Large bed, great linen. Breakfast was included - not a very extensive buffet, but was all we needed (and again, for free!). Restaurant and bar not great, but do-able. Free shuttle bus to and from the hotel to the Dubai Mall/beach once a day. Not a great location - but in general Dubai is not made for walking and we never waited longer than a few minutes for a taxi outside the hotel any time of night/day. (Just a tip - many of the taxi drivers don't know the hotel too well, so when you check in - ask them for a business card of the hotel and then you can show the driver the address). Our only criticism of the hotel which could have had the potential to sour our whole stay (but the hotel was so great that it redeemed itself) was that when we booked we warned them that we would be arriving late at night. We ended up, due to a horrendous queue for passport control, getting to the hotel at 2am - only to find out that there was not room service and the restaurant was closed. First criticism is that they could have warned us. Second criticism is that the person who checked is in was highly unsympathetic to my ravenous husband. Remember there are no restaurants or supermarkets within walking distance! We eventually persuaded them to order pizza for us from Pizza hut! Just a good value for money, very friendly hotel.
