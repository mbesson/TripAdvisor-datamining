I don't mind that so much but the view out the window is of a block concrete wall about 10 feet away. Since few reviews mention it that means there are many rooms with a better view. Make sure you ask for a room that looks out onto more than concrete wall. The shower wand is just silly. It isn't the normal handheld shower nozzle that you can put in a holder and have it act like a hands free shower head. This is really a wand, a 10\" long metal tube that sprays water in a line. It is impossible to affix it so that you can shower hands free.

I didn't eat in the restaurant, which was always busy and buzzing, but breakfast was more than adequate.

The staff is somewhat attentive, but the place feels more like an Internet Cafe than a hotel. The room I had was small to average size, but the bath/shower area was extremely dysfunctional with a wand-like shower head and an open style shower that made it difficult to avoid spraying water all over the place. Although I write this laughing, it was really a pain in the $$$ having to ask for another floor mat and towels every time I showered. The free breakfast was more like bagels and apples, but don't expect plenty of them. If breakfast is your thing, you can try IHop across. If you okay with their breakfast. get there early or else eat what is left over. However, the biggest disappointment were the loud noises coming from outside throughout the day. Screaming and yelling from people either whacked out on drugs or drunk, wasn't something I expected at $215 per night. In addition, if you're not the type of person who can physically handle yourself, this may not be the place for you. Although no one tried anything on me, I was on edge there more than any of the times I have been in NY on business, and this is coming from a guy who has stayed at a Howard Johnsons in Jamaica, NY (near JFK) more than a few times.

At night, forget about reading or any other activity that requires some light. The shower is tiny. Everything in general is very small and narrow. But this is, in my opinion, the worst aspect.

I stayed 5 or 6 nights, the problem was never fixed. I missed the NBA finals. When checking out, I reminded the person in charge about the problem and the promised discount, he said we would get a credit on our credit card. Never happened. What a nerve. Frankly, dishonest.

No matter what they say, no matter what they promise, be sure not to get one of those rooms. I wrote them later hoping for a positive response. No answer, nothing.

It's very chic inside but may seem a little quirky to a traditionalist. If you are driving you will be required to park in the adjacent parkade, which cost us around $11.00 per day. Considering this is downtown in a major city, it's very affordable. The hotel offers a continental breakfast which consists of small pastries, juice, tea, coffee, apples/oranges and bagels and toaster. On our second morning I arrived for breakfast one hour before it closed and they were out of bagels. I asked the attendent if there were more bagels and she said no and put the toaster away. Disappointing considering the hotel charges $12.00 extra per night for their \"free\" breakfast, \"free\" wireless, and a couple of other \"free\" things that they advertise.

I complained the first night and the person on the front desk didn't really want to help. They did have other rooms but they'd be just as noisy apparently! The bed has sticky out bits which get your shins, the shower is like an irked snake and wants to jump off the wall to attack you, the water doesn't stay in the shower area and likes to wet everying on the floor (namely towels, with the lack of towel rails) and finally, there's hardly any space around the sink to put anything. The breakfast is back to the weird stylish-before-practicality thing; three choices of pastry and some orange juice. If you want an apple, there are loads. My wife is allergic to nuts so the one pastry she could have eaten, had been lobbed in with the nutty ones - meaning she was welcome to an apple if she wanted... We ate at ihop across the road which was terrible but at least filled us up! Good points - there's an inexpensive, secure car park right next door and the Staples centre is around the corner.

A small hotel with an adjacent independant parking structure ($11.00/day or $20.00/day for in and out priviledges). Very easy check-in and check-out. I had their cheapest room ($98 + change) which was smaller than my apartment, but all I needed to simply spend the night. Very comfortable bed, in-room mini-fridge (which I was told was being switched out so I brought a cooler anyways), coffee maker which I had to move to the floor to make the cord reach an outlet. Bizarre shower fixture which sprayed water into the bathroom since there is only a half-panel glass for the shower. The water sprayes into the toilet area which is only closed off by a semi-luminescent (?sp?) sliding door. Hardly any shelf space near the sink for personal items. No 'guide book' for hotel features, ammenities, restaurant/bar menu, etc... Clock radio had no directions as to how to set the correct time (it was incorrect and I had to call the front desk) or how to 'program' the AC/Heat unit. The hotel does have a bar and restaurant but they included none of this information in the room. They did advise me of the complimentary breakfast buffet which was nothing but juice, coffee, bagels, and dry pastry. I had to leave the lights on 24/7, even during the day as the 'window' was nothing but a 'trough' looking at the walls and air-conditioning pipes. I heard the people above me constantly, not partying or being wild, but just what appeared to be walking around, as well as people on either sides of the room. All in all, even though I was only there to rest before a concert at Staples, and get a nights sleep before driving home, it was an irritating time.

The Staples Centre & LA Live are only 3 blocks away. There are lots of people wearing purple shirts riding bikes who will help with any questions & I found that most people were willing to help you with directions etc. The homeless people are not pushy or very visible where I went. There were a lot of security and police presence everywhere I went & I felt very safe even walking at night. I found my hotel room (Queen) to be very clean & charming with the bed being so comfortable I never had an ache or pain.

To stick with the per diem for hotels, I chose to stay at The O Hotel. The lobby was trendy, and when my co-workers and I checked in around 11 pm, the doorman operated the red-lit elevator for us. I reserved a boutique room, which is the smallest room that you can stay in. Initially I was given a room on one end of the hallway. When I opened the door I was surprised at how small the room was. It seemed to be approximately 10' x 15', and I immediately saw the bed and almost walked into the mini fridge on the floor. The full-sized bed took up almost the entire room! The only positive things I can say about this particular room are that it was clean, quiet, and the bed was comfortable. The next evening I went to the front desk to ask if there were any other rooms available (of the same type) that were bigger. I knew that they existed because my co-worker was staying in a boutique room on the other end of the hallway, and it was a little bigger than mine. The woman at the desk gave me a key to the room directly above my coworker's. I was able to switch to it (at no additional charge since it was the same room type) and slept a lot better the rest of the week. I only have a few complaints about this room. There wasn't a lot of good lighting in the bedroom area, I could hear people throwing away garbage (like glass bottles) in the dumpsters in the alley below my room until 11 or 12 at night, and the closest stairwell to my room required me to go through a staff breakroom area when I reached the first floor. One of my co-workers complained about hearing garbage trucks at 4:30 in the morning, and another said that he could hear people \"screaming\" in the rooms on either side of his. I also had to get used to the hand-held shower and the open shower design to make sure that I didn't splash much water onto the bathroom floor. Overall, I would recommend The O Hotel if you weren't staying more than a couple of nights and don't mind noise. The people at the front desk were always very friendly and helpful (for example, there wasn't a remote in the fitness room, so the employee came in to turn the TV on for me).

It seemed like a great value for the price, to me. The Japanese-influenced decor is soothing yet fashionable, and the architects paid quite a lot of attention to detail. For example, the hollow in the shower for the fancy soaps and shampoo is exactly vertically centered among the rectangular tiles. (Tip: the bathroom does have a door--it's sliding glass, and not that easy to see at first!) I enjoyed the mood lighting (base of the bed lights up; elevator is red), though it might be difficult if you were trying to, say, work on your screenplay at night. The location is pleasant: a clean street on one of the better blocks of downtown, right near a new and fancy Ralphs supermarket. The lobby is glamourous--you could probably bring clients there, and make them feel impressed. A great place to be if you're planning to visit MOCA, the Disney Concert Hall, the Mark Taper Forum or Staples Center.

I was told the hotel just opened the week before (9/07) -- the fitness room was not ready yet, nor was the restaurant/ bar. The hotel definitely has style -- the elevator is lit in red, the beds glow from beneath, the wash basin is a stone bowl instead of sunken ceramic basin. I really enjoyed the decor. Even the stylish absence of a door on the shower amused me, although my colleague reported substantial water loss onto the bathroom floor. There were a few little irritations: my shower did not work at first (it was fixed that day); it took the hotel several hours to get my colleague an iron; the internet connection worked great, but it cost $5 to rent a cable, then another $5 when I left it at work and had to buy it; and my colleague's TV did not work at first. I assume these are mostly new-hotel kinks that will get worked out. The staff were friendly and helpful, and at $130+tax it was a fair bit cheaper than the Wilshire Grand nearby.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto Ontario", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly good value for location\u201d", "Author": "MA&DF", "ReviewID": "UR8051919", "Content": "I was quite worried about our first trip to LA based on the hotel reivews I had read that were within our price range.
