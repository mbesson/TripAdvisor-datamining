The bed was big, the bathroom was clean and the air-con was fast and effective. It is only a 5 minute walk to the MTR (subway) and has a great variety of eating and market shopping places nearby. The Wifi was very good. It dropped out about once per day but only for a few minutes; otherwise it was very fast. We used to live in Hong Kong so were very used to the stair-well access to the road but honestly, one reviewer here said this was unsafe however HK is one of the safest / crime-free cities in the world so this really isn't an issue. I actually enjoyed the anonymity of coming and going as we pleased without the hotel staff seeing us. I only had one time I called front desk. I wanted to make a cup of tea but there was no sugar. They informed me the hotel doesn't supply sugar but then about 10 minutes later a porter knocked on the door with a few sachets of sugar. Having lived there we were also used to the compact way HK people can make a room. The only thing I thought was too small was the wash basin as you can't fully lean over the basin while brushing your teeth / shaving but in reality this is not really a big deal.

There were two entrances to the hotel, one which looked like a residental house entrance, and a few door further along the street, there was another entrance that was far more trendy with lots of blue lighting and black reflective surfaces. The hotel was arranged within two adjoined buildings, but only one side had a lift, but even in the side without a lift (where I was staying), the staff were helpful with moving luggage in. All of the communal areas were clean and attractively presented, and there was also a business centre with computers and other business related bits and bobs. The room itself was clean and a resonable size. I had a double room, but the bed seemed a wee bit wider than a standard double. The bed was quite hard, but comfortable, and the (white) bed linens were flawlessly clean and totally unstained. There was also a DVD player and a LAN cable for the wired internet access. The ensuite bathroom was an acceptable size, and complimentary shaving and dental kits were provided along with the usual shampoos etc. One thing to mention however, is that the sink is very narrow and between two walls, so if you are blessed with the gift of shoulders and/ or arms, doing anything over the sink will be difficult (ie. shaving, washing your hands etc). Given the resonable price, I would have given the hotel a 5 star rating, however, it was very noisey at night. I was in a street facing room on the third floor, but the exterior wall onto the balcony is made of thin wood, and a lot of noise gets in. There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel, so that exacerbates the noise problem (the buses run until about midnight).

I got quite a good deal, paying 425HK$ for the night. The room has a double bed that is wedged in between two walls, so not ideal if you are tall or claustrophobic. The bathroom was a good size and the complementary toiletries are always nice. I ended up having to stay another night but by that time i could only get the superior room. This worked out 725HK$, which is still cheaper than the 1500HK$ they will want if you book it through the hotel. The room was bigger with two single beds, although the bathroom was slighty smaller. If you think you will need to stay longer than the hotel check out at 12.00, i would book another night as it is 100HK$ every hour as a late check out fee. The good thing about the rooms is that each room has a large flatscreen TV, complete with english TV channels and a load of movies you can watch. The staff are generally friendly, the cleaning ones always greet you warmly. Some of the bad points: there is no lift, so you have to haul your luggage up from the first floor or down from the sventh floor, its up to you. Also if you get a room on the front of the hotel, its quite noisy with all the traffic paired with the balcony doors. I think its better to subsitute the window in a room for some peaceful sleep. A final point is the scuffed paint i had in my double value room. I don't know why every hotel room, apartment or office in china is painted white. The dirt and scuff marks show up very easily and are often not repainted for years. I really think as a hotel this should have been touched up.

Which they do claim is \"is perfectly suited to the needs of the business traveller, served by the latest technology, services and devices.\" Well I took pictures: - Bed - 72\" x 48\" - Mirror hidden behind bathroom door - Sink 8\" diameter basin with textured glass behind it (No mirror behind it). - there was a refrigerator and hot water heater - the clock in the room was analog and clicked all night - there was a TV and Air Conditioning . . . but could not find the remotes. - there was NO balcony (Like so many others talk about on this site) - the shower was so small but they did have hot water and good water pressure. . . - the soaps they put in bathroom were in hard shampoo bottles and difficult to get out. - the internet was worthless, I spent 2 hours trying to download email (I stayed on a Sunday night without much incoming email). When I checked out. . . same two girls were at the counter. I told them that I felt cheated and that Mingle By the Park misrepresents their rooms by showing photos rooms with real sized beds. I guess they have heard this many times before as they did not care. If you feel energetic and don't need any service . . . this could be a good place . . . but if you are a business person . . .

The entrance to the hotel itself is sandwiched between a Chinese health shop and I think it was an opticians. It it so small you would miss it if you didn't know it was there!!. It was however perfect for what I needed. A bed and a shower for a few nights. It had a TV and free Wifi which was great given thatI only paid the equivalent of about 25/30 GBP per night! The bathroom was the smallest room ever and the sink was hilarious, around 6 inches wide between 2 walls with a mirror over the sink - you could only squeeze one shoulder in at a time to see in the mirror, but its all part of the HK charm! The bed stretched from one side of the room to the window, with just a few cm's spare to get in and out. Its exactly as it says on their website and really cute for a solo traveller. Perfectly situated on the MTR, bus and tram lines. Noisy as it is on the main Wanchai to Central road - but you know what youre booking when you look it up so it wasn't a problem to me. I used to live in HK so I knew it would be like this given the fact it was on the busiest road ever !! It also had the smallest balcony in the world. Standing room only ! I just loved this place Staff were very friendly and kept my luggage in their tiny recption on the last day so I didnt have to drag it round with me. given this is far more like a hostel than a hotel I was impressed with the staff and the Wifi for the money.

We would buy the local delights from the neighbourhood and enjoy it in the private garden. Plus points: - Quaint, historical boutique hotel with an interesting concept. Read all about it in the tourist kit in the room. Tourist kit also had great tips for visiting major tourist spots. - Clean & thoughtful with their toiletries - Helpful service staff - Great location. Close to MTR station. - The hotel has a huge collection of free movies on your 'smart' tv system. To unwind after a day of shopping/sightseeing, I unwound by watching all 3 series of Ip Man (very appropriate themed movie being in HK) :) - Free Wifi Minus points: - Small bathroom space - Small in general - Noisy (if you are facing the main road.

There are eateries, shopping centres and convenience stores nearby. The entrance was extremely difficult to find. It's just a narrow entrance leading onto stairs with a small sign - it's in the middle of a row of shops. I doubt if taxis would know it as it's new and not very visible.

The room itself is tiny - possibly the smallest I've ever stayed in! Use of space was ingenious with a mini bar fridge, tea/coffee area, pull out desk and wardrobe all in a small alcove. There's also an LCD TV over the bed and aircon. The bathroom is a good size considering. The only awkwardness was a lack of space for my suitcase - I pushed it towards the balcony door where it was mostly out of the way. WiFi is included and was of good quality with good signal strength. The TV has a good selection of English-speaking cable channels as well as local free to air channels. There was no lift and the security/door man is available to help bring suitcases up and down. I stayed on level 2 so it was just a short walk up and down: probably faster to get in and out than many hotels with their busy lifts. The room also featured a very small balcony, facing onto Wanchai Rd. The building is a renovated 1960s block of flats and there are some nice design touches as well as comprehensive booklet introducing guests to traditional life in these apartments (as was).
