My parents stayed here between 8 and 14 September 2011. I live in Istanbul and they were coming here for my wedding. My partner and I chose the hotel months earlier and looked at a Deluxe room (it was Easter and no standard rooms were vacant to look at). I should say here that a Deluxe room is one level up from a standard room. It was beautifully decorated and huge, so we logically thought that a standard room, even if half the size, would be fine. The hotel also has a lift, which is important for my father, who cannot climb a lot of stairs. My husband's brother-in-law is a travel agent here and he booked it for us and got the normal travel agent rate (about 20 Euros less than if you walk in off the street). When my parents arrived at 1am last Friday, I couldn't believe the way the staff behaved. An older man at reception started the check-in, then abandoned it when some people he knew came in the hotel. He started chatting while my parents (my father is 88) stood up waiting. When I asked if we could hurry because my parents were very tired, he was rude and dismissive. I've lived in Turkey for seven years, my husband is Turkish and we know that this kind of behaviour is totally alien to Turkish culture - older people are greatly respected and treated with care, as are visitors generally. Then we saw the room - it was a third of the size of a deluxe room. You couldn't both move around the bed at the same time, there wasn't space for a dressing table or even a proper wardrobe. The wardrobe was like a very long, slim cupboard, about double the size of a CD rack. We asked to be changed and they transferred my parents to a downstairs room of exactly the same size. The bellboy was clearly embarrassed but of course it was not in his hands. Apparently there were no other rooms available. After much calling the next day, the hotel agreed to move my parents to a deluxe room (at no extra cost), but said that it wouldn't be available until the Sunday, three nights after they arrived. They accepted this. In the meantime, my mother (and my husband, on the phone) asked for coathangers and a chair to put their clothes across - three times, before she eventually got them. They moved to the 'deluxe' room on Sunday and it was exactly the same size as the standard room, just upstairs. The bathroom was actually smaller, so you had to inch around the door to get inside. My husband and I came in the car to pick up my parents several times, and once we asked to park in the car park for an hour or two while we took them down the road for a coffee. Apparently this was 'forbidden', even though the car park was nearly empty. For balance and honesty I will say that they said the breakfast was huge and impressive (we saw the roof terrace and it has a great view) and the decoration and quality of the fixtures and fittings is very good, the air conditioning works etc. I can't comment on the gym or sauna as they didn't use any of those facilities. I am extremely upset that my parents were treated this way, as well as the fact that the room was terribly small. I believe now that the hotel management showed the biggest, most impressive room (natural, all hotels do this), but that they then accommodate people in box rooms after they have booked. Three years ago my parents stayed at Side Hotel, a completely different kind of place - much more basic and rustic with a simple breakfast (my younger brother stayed there this time). But for my parents, for our wedding week, we wanted them to stay somewhere a little more comfortable. However, when they come back again we will return to the Side because there we know what we are getting and the staff behave as if they want their guests to come back! (For clarity, I am not affiliated in any way with Side Hotel). Please don't stay at this hotel and make them richer!

The hotel is just finishing its major renovations and it is major!! The hotel is being completly renovated inside and outside and when i was there they were finishing off some of the rooms and doing the reception area. Location: Fantastic 10/10. Only a 2 min walk from the main shops and tram service. There is a little garden area before you enter the main road so hotel is set a little back which makes it quieter and more suitable. 5-10min to Blue Mosque., Hagia Sofia and Grand Bazaar. By Tram only 3 stops to spice bazaar and Topkapi Palace. Rooms: Very Grand and nice. Go for the Deluxe rooms worth a little extra for the room. My parents room has nice double bed, a dressing table, a small table and 2 chairs and a wardrobe. With two windows - one balcony looking over to Hagia Sofia and a window looking at Blue Mosque. My room was a twin room with ample space. Lovely walk in shower. One downside to take into mind if going in peak times is that the walls are thin! We can hear people talking in next room in bathroom and in room, but as April was off peak not so significant. Breakfast and Terrace View: Breakfast is served between 7am to 10am. A very big buffet with everything and anything! Breakfast is exceptional. You sit on the the terrace which is glassed (or can sit outside) with views over istanbul and of the blue mosque and hagia sofia truly break taking !!!!!!! Istanbul itself: I found quite costly in terms of food and taxis. There were four of us but we would pay approx \u00c2\u00a335-40 for a meal and with all the added extras can be more! Taxis it is best to ask price before getting in, we found it easier to use tram service it costs only 1.5 turkish liras per person and if you get on at Sultanahment station (right in front of hotel) it will take you 3 stops to spice bazaar and Topkapi palace in one direction and in opposite direction 3 stops to grand bazaar. Its really easy to work out just look at the map or ask someone! always willing to help. You can walk to Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia, just head towards the building cutting through the park and it is very quick. If there is any other questions you would like to ask drop a reply or note to this post and i will try and help. Will post a pic of hotel in a few days. Overall Hotel was very nice, breakfast was fantastic, rooms were very clean and adequate. Location is fantastic, only downside walls a bit thin but if you are going to be out quite late and if you are not a very light sleeper (which i am) you should be fine.
