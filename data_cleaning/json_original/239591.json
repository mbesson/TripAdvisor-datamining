They offer breakfast for 12 euro (we never tried it). They also have a laundromat a couple of doors down which was really handy. The hotel is close to La Rambla if you want to be right in the action. Really the only downside was the price, we paid approx 840 euro for the five nights. Others we met seemed to think this was pricey. Hard to tell, we have had far better prices in the rest of Spain (including Madrid) so not sure if this is just a Barcelona issue in that prices here are higher. We did have a hell of a time trying to book accommodation in Barcelona, we took this hotel after being told by about 7 others that they were full. Would advise to shop around if you can.

However, upon coming to Barcelona, we realized that we were going to need to splurge a bit on a hotel for our enjoyment and safety (after all, it was our honeymoon), and thought that the Hotel Principal looked nice from its website photos and also seemed to be a \"decent\" price (90 euros) if we agreed to pay in advance and book ahead. It was, ironically enough, the only hotel that we didn't research ahead of time on TripAdvisor, as we decided at the last minute to visit Barcelona on our travels. To say that our experience with Hotel Principal was disappointing would be an understatement. Upon arriving to the room and the hotel in general, had we not already paid in advance (to our sadness), we would have walked out the door and found someplace way better. The walk from the metro station to the hotel took us down dirty alley streets smelling of garbage and urine, graffitied buildings, party hostels and bars, before we finally found the Hotel Principal. The attendant checking us in promptly informed us of the pickpocketers of Barcelona, and how to fend of an attack if necessary. He also told us not to stay out late at night in order to be safer on the streets coming back to the hotel. I was a little freaked out by this, as I'd never had a hotel clerk greet me with this kind of a warning before. When we came to our room, it was completely BARE minimum. The sheets were incredibly scratchy (complete with hairs on them-- thank you very much), you could feel the springs through the bed, there were stains on the walls, and the floors creaked from the plastic-y hardwood. The hotel also had a weird system where you had to put your room key in a slot on the wall to turn the lights on in the room, but this system also lit up a red light outside your door, letting everyone know when you were and were not present in your room. That was super weird and we were not at all comfortable with that indicator. We hid our possessions just in case. We skipped out of breakfast and were glad we did so, because they charged an outrageous price. The hotel thankfully had free wireless internet, and the other guests all seemed to be of more an adult caliber, which was nice. It was honestly nothing more than a glorified hostel. And really, if we only paid 30 euros a night for the room I would totally not be complaining-- you get what you paid for. But 90 euros??? We saw MUCH better places for 90 euros around the city, but were stuck at our hotel due to pre-payment. When we told them that we wanted to be upgraded since it was our honeymoon, they said, \"sorry, we're fully booked\" which was completely untrue. We were very disappointed in the service we received at the hotel. I kind of felt sorry for the workers though-- working there would bring my morale down also. It is completely NOT worth the money, and it really makes me mad that their website advertisements make it seem much more glamorous and spacious than it really was. It was also in the part of town that every guidebook tells you to avoid. Yes it was close to the Ramblas, but that street isn't much to rave about either. It's filled with weird carnival mimes doing awkward things, people shoving you to buy things, and drunk people most of the time. We preferred the Olympic Village area and places not so 'downtown.' I would definitely stay in a different area if we ever visit Barcelona again (which is unlikely). Avoid this place if you want a better hotel for your money!!!", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWhat a little gem of a hotel\u201d", "Author": "jmgale", "ReviewID": "UR71821865", "Content": "Arrived on the day that Spain won the World Cup... what a celebration.

It offers free computer usage and internet. The rooms were basic but very clean. The bathroom was great, especially in comparison to \"American\" standards and absolutely beats the \"European\" standard. With that said, there were some interesting aspects about staying at the hotel. First, when we arrived the receptionist kept mentioning that breakfast was in the main dining room. He gave us the times and said to go there when we woke up. Fast forward to check-out -- breakfast is NOT included and cost 10 euros/day per person. NOT WORTH IT. It was annoying because the entire time it sounded like it was included with our booking. I accept full responsibility for not verifying that information prior to having breakfast, but it still seemed \"shady\" not to mention it. One general safety issue for me is the knowing/not knowing if people are in their rooms. The hotels all have bright red lights above the doors that turn on when the key is inserted into the space to turn on the electricity. This does not seem safe. Basically a big target that yes, we are in the room. My impression of Barcelona is colored by the concern for my safety. Rick Steves recommends to never venture west of Las Ramblas -- and that is exactly where this hotel is located -- one block west of Las Ramblas. There is graffiti, homeless people, dirty streets, and a ton of people who can \"pick\" you out as a tourist. I was expecting a grandiose Barcelona, and was severely disappointed by the city. Las Ramblas had tacky tourist/souvenir stores and fast food restaurants. The tapas restaurants hardly had any \"true\" tapas food. It was not the best area to stay in. To further complicate this issue of safety... We showed our itinerary to the receptionist and verified that we would be safe walking around the city. By the end of our discussion we had five main roads to walk on and lots of mini streets to walk quickly through and avoid if we could. I did not have a good experience in Barcelona and partly colored by the location of the hotel.

So we immediately realize that we can hear every sound coming from the hallway. Everything. the rolling carts, people talking, laughing, doors closing (slamming). We are pretty easygoing so it didn't bother us. After a day full of activities we get back to bed and were watching a TV show on our tiny netbook, and we hear this knocking on our door. I figured it would just go away, the hotel woulndt knock, they would call if they wanted to contact us. Knocking did not stop. so i have to get out of bed, put something on, and answer the door. and it's some hotel clerk telling me that there's a NOISE COMPLAINT!! about us!

When our cab brought us to the hotel the driver laughed and said, \"Authentico Barcelona!\" It's a very short walk to Las Ramblas, and to either the front or back entrance of La Boqueria, the large open-air food market. I found the location perfect for sightseeing, we were maybe a 3 minute walk from the middle of Las Ramblas, near the edge of Bari Gotic, and the L3 line of the Metro (Liceu stop). About 1/2 mile(10 minute walk) from Placa Catalunya. This location is not only convenient for sightseeing, but much quieter than the hotels that are directly on Las Ramblas or Placa Catalunya. The rooms are not especially soundproof (no rugs in rooms or halls) but the hotel was not noisy. The room was spotlessly clean, a decent size with plenty of storage. Bathroom was large. We had 2 small balconies that looked out onto the street and the building across the street (apparently the back of that building). The TV left something to be desired, but who goes to Barcelona to watch TV? Breakfast cost 10 Euros but was plentiful - eggs, sausage, bacon, breads, salad, fruit juice, cereal, coffee & tea. More than a typical European continental breakfast. Its also easy to walk over to La Boqueria and get some bread, fruit, and drinks. The beds are extremely firm, but we like them that way. We were on the 3rd floor, and the WiFi worked well in our room.

But it was such a great location, even with the slightly questionable neighborhood immediately surrounding it, that I'm very glad we stayed there.

We saw MANY people wheeling their luggage to/from the Aerobus along Las Ramblas and in the area around Placa Catalunya. If you go to Barcelona, beware of pickpockets. Our son is a college student there, and used an ATM on Placa Catalunya in the middle of the day. Two teenage girls shoved a clipboard in his face asking him to sign something just after he hit the \"get cash\" button.

I definitely agree with the other reviewers about the location - its great. Very close to La Rambla (2 minute walk down a nice street) but far enough away that its quiet for sleeping. Its also very close to the Market, which is a definite must-see if visiting Barcelona. There's also a parking garage across the street from the hotel, but I don't know if there are any discounts associated with being a guest at the hotel. I found the hotel to be clean, and pretty modern on the inside, and appears to have been very recently renovated/refurbished. My wife also liked it, and she can be fussy about this kind of thing, so that's a good sign. We stayed in a superior room with a terrace. Our room was quite large (especially by European standards) with two twin beds put together, rather than a Queen (not unusual in Europe), with a couch, flat screen TV, and a good sized closet and bathroom, as well as a terrace, overlooking the street. I've seen the standard rooms and there is a BIG difference - especially considering they're not that much cheaper than the superior rooms. The hotel has 3 computers with internet access that are free for guests to use, and a breakfast area that serves a standard hotel breakfast (its fine if its included in your room rate, but probably not worth buying if its not). Hotel Staff was friendly enough - they don't go out of their way, but they're not rude either, which is fine with me. Its not a 5 star hotel, after all. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay - I have no complaints with the place. Great location, nice, clean and modern, reasonably priced for the location. It is not a 2 star hotel - its not priced like a 2 star and the rooms and amenities are definitely 3 star quality at a minimum.

The hotel was basic and although pricey I expected more, with a restful lounge/bar area where I could sit and read/relax rather than in my room. There was a seating/internet area which will appeal to some and some vending mchines for snacks/drinks, (the restaurant only serves breakfast from 7.30am - 10.30am) but the seating area was nothing more than a few basic chairs and tables in what was essentially the corridor area to the lift. A bar would have been a plus. Beware of ordering a taxi from the reception as I was charged an additional 9.50 euros when I came to pay the taxi driver at the airport on top of the 25 euros fare, which he stated was a booking fee for the hotel which I was not warned about. The Aerobus to/from the airport departs/drops off at the Plaza Catalunya and costs 4.25 euros each way, and one stop on the tube is 1.35 euros, although with not such heavy cases you could walk to the plaza and save a taxi/tube fare! Recommended sights - City bus tours, cable car from Montjuic, a coffee in the cafeteria at the top of El Corte Ingles for the spectacular views, the promenade for drinks/tapas (bit pricey though) in front of the History Musuem. The restaurant at the top of the History Museum offers a menu for 10 euros including starter/main/drink/sweet & coffee (lunchtime only).

Knowing that we had so little time in Barcelona, we didn't intend to waste much of it in our room so it didn't make sense to splurge, and location was a priority to optimize what we could see during our short stay. While I probably would not choose this hotel for a longer stay, it was virtually perfect for our needs, especially considering that it was by far the cheapest non-hostel option available to us at the time. Definitely check the hotel's website for specials. Hotel Principal was about a ten-minute walk from the Aerobus stop at Placa de Catalunya. (Be sure you have an old-fashioned map or directions, as the crowded nature of the area meant our GPS unit had trouble finding a signal.) Cabs were readily available in the plaza for those who would prefer not to walk. We were somewhat concerned we'd look out of place trudging around with our suitcases, but many others on the street were also clearly tourists en route to local hotels. Hotel Principal is only a couple of blocks off La Rambla, which we thought was great because it meant the benefits of the location without the crowds and noise of the main drag (and we had no interest in touristy La Rambla itself anyway). The hotel's neighborhood didn't make us feel any less comfortable than anyplace else we went in Barcelona - we never felt particularly uncomfortable anywhere - but we weren't out past midnight, so I can't comment on the area late at night. There were a decent number of other people, sufficient lighting, and several restaurants/storefronts...it certainly didn't have a \"back alley\" feel or anything. The front desk staff spoke English and were friendly at check-in. Our room was on the second floor. We used the elevator (painfully slow - there's only one tiny elevator for the entire hotel!) to bring our bags up to our room but subsequently used the charming marble staircase for other trips up and down. The room was tiny, with barely enough room for a bed and small dresser. Everything was clean, and the bed was fortunately more comfortable to sleep on than we expected after first sitting on it. The bathroom was actually quite large. Essentially, the accommodations were about the equivalent of an EconoLodge or Motel Six, albeit with a bit more charm. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, as there are many little cafes a short walk from there (as well as La Boqueria market). Just be aware that nothing opens for breakfast until after 8 am - we're morning people and had gone to bed before midnight because of jet lag, so it was a bit of a shock to find that we had the city pretty much to ourselves when we ventured out around 7! As I mentioned, the location was the best part of this hotel. We wandered all over the city (Gothic Quarter, Parc de la Ciutadella, Monument a Colom, Mansana de la Discordia, etc.) and never once needed a cab or public transportation. We did decide to take a cab to our ship, and that was a good choice, as the terminal area was not particularly pedestrian-friendly and was quite a trek from the Columbus monument. Really the only complaint I have about this hotel, taking into account the expectations one should have for a budget hotel, pertains to their luggage holding process. There is a large open area adjacent to the lobby, and that's where guests are instructed to leave luggage as needed. No one watches to see who accesses this room (which doesn't even have a door), there is no claim ticket, and there's nothing to stop people from walking out with any of the luggage in there. Check out time was 10:30, not 11 as was noted on the confirmation materials I received when making the reservation, and we opted not to board our ship until after 3 pm. We didn't want to miss our chance to explore Barcelona, but I would have felt better while doing so if our belongings were a bit safer. That\u2019s the only aspect of our stay that would make me hesitate to book Hotel Principal again for a pre-cruise night.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cLoved This Hotel - Gracias :D :D :D\u201d", "Author": "manhannz", "ReviewID": "UR24209172", "Content": "If you go to Barcelona, stay at this hotel.

Overall we found the hotel to be lovely and it was in a superb location just off the Rambla, although some sights are quite a way away such as the Sagrada Familia and the Nou Camp, however we like walking and so this wasn't a problem, the metro also runs to these sights. At first, i must admit, we were a little concerned about the hotels situation as it was accessed by a small side street, we soon found, however, that the street was quite well lit and was very busy at all times even at night and so we didn't feel as threatened. Also it is a very short walk from the Rambla. On first impressions our room was a little small although we had booked a standard double and not an upgrade. The room was perfect for what we wanted, though, as we were simply using it as a base. The hotel has a clever light on the outside of the door which is switched on when you insert your key card into the electric slot within your room, this was really good as the maid knew when you were still in your room. The rooms and the whole hotel were absolutely spotless, the maid actually mopped the floors everyday and the towels were changed if left on the floor. We did have a small leak in our shower, but it was very small and we just mopped it up with a towel after we had finished. Also i would say that the shower was only warm and not hot, but this is very picky and it depends on personal preference. There was a kettle and safe within the room although there was a charge for the safe of \u20ac2.50 a day which wasn't too bad. We had the breakfast in the hotel everyday, it was very nice although a expensive at \u20ac9 each, there is a little cafe at the end of the street which looked nice although we did not try it. The breakfast was a buffet and so you could go up and get whatever you wanted. Breakfast consisted of hot food including: Scrambled eggs- which were very good Bacon Sausage- often 2 types, 1 spicy and the other like a hot dog Beans Fried eggs/omelette- this varied Bread for toasting- both brown and white Cold food: Meats Cheese Salad- tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber, etc Cereals Drinks: Tea Coffee Milk Fruit Juices- orange was very nice There was also croissants and a selection of jams or honey. Last year we went to Paris and i would say that Barcelona is definitely better and i felt far safer, however, it is very expensive, especially with the current \u00a3 to \u20ac rate. Lastly just a few tips, the Sagrada Familia and Nou Camp are a must, for the Nou Camp make sure you check the opening times on the website and get there early if you want to go on the tour, it is very popular. We also spent a lovely afternoon/evening at the top of Montjuic watching the sunset over Barcelona, the views from the top by the castle are amazing. I would recommend walking up Montjuic, however, it is a steep pull and there is a cable car which also has amazing views but is very high and quite expensive as it is double the price for a return!! We tried the aquarium also as it rained one day, this was a lot of fun, although again expensive at \u20ac17 each. Port Vell at the bottom of the Rambla is lovely especially on a sunny day, from here you can watch the cable cars on Montjuic. Just one more tip, there is a lovely little Italian called the Ideal Restaurant, it is on the Rambla on the corner of Carrer Nou de la Rambla. The Sangria is lovely and i must recommend the tortellini cream and ham which was so good i had it twice in our 3 day stay, my boyfriend also recommends the pizza, the food arrived very quickle and was piping hot. Don't be put off by there being nobody else in (if this happens to be the case), someone has to be first, and others will follow.

Room itself was perfectly adequate for our needs, although we didnt spend much time there!!! Only thing that let the room down was the tepid water in the power shower, no matter what we tried we could'nt get it hot, that was a minor niggle though! 2 day safe hire was E5.75. Location was fine, 5 mins stroll from Ramblas, a little way into El Raval but at no time did we feel intimidated or uncomfortable. We are already planning another visit next year and will be using the same hotel. We were very vigilant looking out for any pickpockets etc...but can honestly say we saw absolutely nothing, I had a small money pouch that I carried under my arm so felt quite at ease. Food was fantastic, we ate at Quinze Nits one night and The Attic on Ramblas another. Both times fantastic, Quinze Nits was cheap as chips too but get there early, large queues later. Done the touristic bus, well worth it, Sagrada Familia can only be seen, no words can describe how unbelievable it is. Montjuic cable car was good, although we thought it went from where the bus drops you up to the castle then down to the marina, there are actually 2 cable car systems, the one down to the Marina is located a bit lower down from the one to the castle! The only time we nearly fell into a tourist trap was when we had been recommended Nuria retaurant at the top of Ramblas, we went to the door, a lady in a long black coat was a doorperson, we had looked at the menu outside and proceeded to enter Nuria as the prices were very reasonable, as we approached, the lady said we could go in a side entrance???? It was actually a glass door 2 feet to the left! So up the stairs we went and into the restaurant, shown to a table, there was only about 8 people in and checked the menu. To our shock the prices were double to the menu outside advertised. Me and my girlfriend decided to walk out, we got back outside the restaurant and the doorlady asked if we wanted to eat downstairs, she got told what to do!!! When looking back at the restaurant facade you could see the restaurant we were taken to was actually called Barco (sp) She had obviously been told to try and get peple into the more expensive restaurant first! So beware. But that was the only downer on an otherwise fantastic place and that was minor. English style bars were few and far between, Irish pub prices...you're looking at around 11 euros for 2 pints!!! After that we drank in the Hard Rock on Placa Catalunya, 7 euros for 2 pints.

Despite the colourful district we did not feel uncomfortable at any time tho' we did take a while to get over the semi-hysterical warnings about pick pockets at every turn. We had our car broken into in Paris as early as 1979 & know that if you experience or witness something it IS shocking but we feel this danger was overhyped to the point of potentially scaring people off Barcelona. Anyway it is also possibly that 2 women might have felt less secure in this district than a 'couple'. I sleep badly and so sent a list of attributes that I would appreciate our room having - I was not encouraged to be over-optimistic BUT the hotel came up trumps in all regards so that we had a very quiet room to the back away from the early chambermaid area & lift, without any scope for inconsiderate late returners disturbing us, being at the end of a corridor. We did indeed 'lie in' & MUCH appreciated the teabag left each day [one pack of digestives we'd brought with us & the tea - you'll need some UHT - was enough to get us moving before we explored the endless local possibilities for a coffee and croissant or pastry]. The nearby Boqueria Market can't be talked up too much - whether in search of delightful photos or food to take away, fruit or edible gifts, it was a daily must. La Rambla may have its tacky sides but it was an entertaining ramble (ha!) home via the endless moving statues, despite the appallingly caged birds (the only time I was 'threatened' was by such a stall owner when I took 2 photos) and the many shops of all price ranges. I think we ate twice there - too tired to ramble further & neither was a disater or a rip off, tho' we did walk out of one place which was going that way before ordering; you just need to choose carefully. We ate thrice in the Gothic Quarter, thanks to previous reviewers, and once round the corner from our hotel in the Square St Augusti (decor past its best but reasonably priced, opposite the cocktail bar & Orgasmic. We had our last lunch at the latter before catching our Airport bus - it WAS delicious & I thoroughly recommend it for a change, it having good natural vegi fare as well as low key tapas) The two best meals we had were in the Gothis Qutr, in Plaza Real 10 - Tobogan, & Troubador - Ferran 46. Do try any likely looking patisseries - their coffee is usually above average & the cakes were to die for; in our case near the Fontana Metro (a charming owner) & in the pouring rain in the Gr\u00e0cia district (hazel nut filled meringues). Back to the hotel - we found the desk staff cold and distant, so that we made no attempt to use their expertise tho' on the last day when had to deposit our luggage they were fine & I thought it was a shame they had this kind of metaphorical defence wall - they'd been downright cold when we'd arrived late & tired, & my padlock that I'd put on my backpack in paranoia jammed so I couldn't access my booking etc.; the same happened when I had difficulty accessing my hotmail on their free pc's - they said there were no problems; the other users then told me they all had problems too. We also felt it was a bit sad that they felt they had to charge daily for safe usage in our room though I know it's not uncommon, the guest really has no choice. We would also recommend the 2 day bus touristique, tough luck if you get dreadful weather like we did for half a day as you see nothing from the downstairs floor & don't get off much but it gets you home in one piece with an idea of where to go back. We found the commentary sporadically sparse compared to Palma, Turin, Glasgow or Edinbro'. The queues at the beginning are ridiculous but think 'out side the square' & you'll soon solve that one :) We would highly recommend the son et lumi\u00e8re Magic Fountain in Montju\u00efc [note this only happens Fri & Sat 7-9 in the low season] - that whole quarter with the olympic area at the top (& Miro) and the MNAC collection & at present the Art Nouveau Alphonse Mucha at the Caixa Forum is a must. The rest of our time was divided between the obvious La S Fam, Parc G, & La Ped [glorious all 3 of course] - note the Port is a good destination in the rain because of the covered shopping & eating area; we decided to dip our toes in the Med in Sitges [v pretty] so have no idea if we missed much at the Barca beaches. To return to the hotel - you can't go wrong location, cleanliness etc despite one or two eccentricities - remember to ASK for what you want via direct email: hotel@hotelprincipal.es & fingers crossed they'll be as obliging as they were to us when it mattered, if not face to face.", "Date": "October 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cHotel Principal - Fantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Boyd08", "ReviewID": "UR19980646", "Content": "I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Principal with my new husband. We were visiting Barcelona for a short break to see the sights and i had previously booked a higher star rated hotel and changed last-minute as we realised it was quite far out from the centre. I booked this hotel based on the previous reviews and i am so glad i did!!! We got a taxi direct to the hotel for around 25 euros, we arrived 2 hours before check-in and although our room wasn't ready we were able to leave our luggage in a side room and asked to come back an hour later (so still earlier than we were supposed to check-in). La Rambla is less than a 5 minute walk and is really the centre of going anywhere in Barcelona. We returned and got the key to our room, where we were so pleasantly surprised, the room/bed/sheets were spotless as was the bathroom with an amazing power shower, some toiletries, clean towels (which were changed every day) and a hairdryer. We had a TV with lots of channels, altho the only English speaking channel was CNN, but who cares, you're not there for the tv!! You have free access to internet in the hotel, they have 2 or 3 PC's which you can use at anytime and vending machines, for drinks/snacks/neccessities. They have a buffet breakfast from 7.30-10.30, for about 7 euros, we never had this but it looked lovely and fresh. The hotel is totally non-smoking, I do smoke but i either went out to the front of the hotel where they had ashtrays or up to the terrace on the roof. The hotel knew we had recently married and they left us a bottle of champagne in our room on the first night with a note to say it was a present to us from the hotel, we were totally overwhelmed as we actually honeymooned in a 5star+ hotel in Mexico and didn't even get so much as a congratulations so it was lovely to have that little caring touch. At the top of the street that the hotel is on there is a little bar/cafe on corner, i think it's called Zanzibar or something similar, the sncks were lovely, and they do the most amazing mohitos. Was lovely to come back after a day of sightseeing and sit there and relax and people watch. I would definitly recommend doing the 2 day Turistic bus tours which run on red/blue/circle routes. The best way to see all of Barcelona in a nut shell - costs 20 E for 1 day or 26E for 2 days, you can buy tickets from Placa Catalyan which is a square at the top of La Rambla, you will see the buses/tour guides when you go up there. My husband and I also had the best meal of our lives at Shoko, a Japanese restaurant down at Port Olympic, we got the Blue Route bus and got off at Po Ol, you will see it from the main road if you go back on yourself, it's tucked in behind the casino. Food amazing and gorgeous setting/atmosphere. We both had starters/mains and i had dessert and a bottle of wine for around 80E but definitly worth it :) Overall, we loved it, there are lots of pickpockets around but if you're aware of them it's fine, we never had any problems although we did see 2 men being pickpocketed, but they had left their bags on the ground and open wide, think they were also locals as we tried to explain to them what had happened and they didn't understand.

I was hesitant to book the hotel but in the end I am sooo glad i did. Sorry this review is so long but i wanted it to be honest and thorough) THE AREA: Excellent for getting around the city. it is right in the heart of the city. The hotel is on the doorstep of LIceu metro station which will take you around town. Outside on la Rambla is a very easy to use bus system, the number 59 takes you direct to the beach. Very close to bars, resturants, cafes etc...all very handy when you find you are eating out most nights and walking home after a heavy meal. Although the hotel is pretty much on las ramblas it is very easy to take a stroll (5 mins walk) to other areas, such as Placa Reial to eat and there are excellent little boutique shops on C/ de Ferran (spelling?). When you come out of Liceu station the first thing you will notice is the smell. BCN does smell, especially in the older parts like Barrio Gotic, Cuitat Veilla, Raval, the beach etc. I don't know why this is (drains, Iave been told) but you get used to it and it isn't all that bad. It's worth staying in these areas because you would miss out on so many cultural experiences otherwise. Secondly you notice the prostitutes. Yes, you heard right, but they are not blatant about what they are doing and definitely not 'slutty' or anything. In fact, most of them are so discreet until someone told me what to look for I missed them. They look like they are just hanging around with their friends, so don't worry about it being a problem if you have children and are staying in that area, it really isn't offensive. HOTEL: Fantastic! We stayed in room 326, a superior room, which we booked with breakfast. This was back in may sometime and cost around \u00a3535. the room was very clean, nicely decorated and spacious, defeinitely big enough for two adults. I would say that perhaps it would not be big enough for a family with young children, particularly more than one child because the furniture is quite large. The room had an IKEA style sofa bed (good for children to sleep on) and a chair. Rooms also had tea making facilities, and cleaners change the cups daily. The cleaners did come rather early, (around 7-8am) but that's typical of all hotels really. The wardrobe is a double, but a small one, but there is plenty of drawer space and a shoe rack. My only qualm is the bathroom. The door is large and when fully open gets in the way of the toilet and so is quite tricky to access. That's all really. the bathroom is very clean, and newly decorated with marble worktops and clean white suits. The staff were very helpful as well, especially as we didn't check until 1am. I no I probably sound like an advert but i was very impressed with the hotel given that it is only a two star.

The hotel was very central - just off the middle of the famous La Ramblas street that everyone visits, and close to lots of shops and restaurants. I had been a bit concerned before we went that some people thought the area was seedy, but it did not seem any different to other back streets in central Barcelona. We were happy with it as it was great to be so central. It was also very easy and cheap to get there from the airport - we caught the airport bus from just outside the airport (4 euros each) to the last stop in town, then walked for 10 minutes down La Ramblas to the hotel street. I would also recommend the \"Bus turistic\" open top double decker, hop on hop off, bus for seeing the whole city easily and at your own pace.

The hotel also has a nice rooftop terrace with ample seating. The outdoor bar/caf\u00e9 at the end of the street is a nice convenience for the weary tourist at the end of the day.

I quite like to be able to have a coffee in the morning before going for breakfast! We weren't booked in for breakfast, but there were plenty of places around the hotel. I would suggest hanging around the Gothic area mostly for bars/restaurants and cafes, as Las Ramblas is very expensive and I wasn\u2019t too impressed, mainly by the rude service.

Location was also very good relativly easy to find altho you may need to ask for directions but people are more then friendly in helping and there is a station nearby to the hotel like 5 mins away. Only thing i have to say to be wary of which is nothing to do with the hotel. Is pickpockets who are rife in Barcelona and i had two not so good experiences with them.

We're in our late 20's and wanted to do a lot of sightseeing and stay at a decent, relatively inexpensive, very conveniently located hotel. This hotel was perfect. We booked at otel dot com and it worked out to about $160 USD/night including buffet breakfast. Room and Check-In: We arrived at the hotel at 10 am after our cruise and were very surprised that our room was ready. We stayed in room 331 (3rd floor) and it was compact and had a view of a wall (ok since we were hardly there). The important items in the room were a hair dryer, safe, no alarm clock (but wake up calls were fine), flat screen tv, kettle, shampoo (not very good quality so bring your own). Location: Excellent! This was the reason we stayed here. If you're coming from the airport (buy a T10 - 10 trips for $6.90 euros or $1.25 euros per single ticket), take the Renfe train to Placa de Catalunya (20 minutes) and you can either walk down La Rambla (10 minutes) or transfer to the metro and go to Liceu station (2-3 minute walk). Either option, you want to turn right on Carrer de Hospital and turn left 2 blocks down on Junta Del Comerc. Once you turn the corner, you'll see the hotel. You're about 2 blocks (3 minute walk) from the closest metro stop and the subway is very easy to use. You can also walk to most places including Mercat de la Boqueria (<5 minutes), Catedral de Barcelona (10 minutes) , Museu Picasso (15 minutes), Placa de Catalunya (10 minutes) where most of the good shopping starts as you head further up. Amenities/Service: Not very many as this is a 2 star hotel and service was ok (although dining room employees were very nice). Free internet on the main floor (3 terminals) was excellent. The service/hospitality from the front desk employees is seriously lacking. On a few occassions, the front desk employees didn't speak English well at all and if they could, they didn't have answers to my questions. Buffet breakfast: Very good selection and fills you up for a good day of sight seeing. Selections included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, croissants, toast, selection of hams and cheeses, yogurt, cereal, milk, coffee, and teas. Restaurant recommendations: -Comerc 24 (take the subway to Arc de Triomf) - had the tasting menu for about $60 euros/person (wine extra). Very creative and tasty dishes. -Cal Pep (near Museu Picasso/walking distance) - very tasty tapas including calamari and sausages for around $10 euros each tapa -Can Majo (take the subway to Barceloneta or walk >30 minutes) - best seafood paella at $14 euros/person -El Cellar de Can Roca (in Girona, 1 hour by train) - 11th best restaurant in the world this year. Tasting menu was around $80 euros and was truly a memorable and delicious experience. Girona is also a very lovely city to explore. -do not eat on La Rambla as it is overpriced and the food quality is ok -Pans is a fast food type sandwich place (all over and one on La Rambla) - good choice if you're in a hurry or want something relatively cheap ($4 euros for a footlong ham and brie sandwich) Shopping Recommendations: -Zara, H&M, Mango, Sfera are all on Passeig de Gracia -soccer jerseys can be found in many stores along La Rambla and all over as well as Nike and FCB (the official Barca store). There's one at the airport too for your last chance to buy one. Other notes: -we stayed at Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya for one night before our cruise (4 star, much better hotel, but away from the touristy sights). Booked at HotelsRUs dot com for $176 USD/night including an excellent buffet breakfast -take a taxi to the cruise terminal (we walked 2 miles from the bottom of La Rambla) I'm happy to answer any questions at caprice611 at hotmail dot com.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barceloan", "Title": "\u201cNot a happy hotel experience\u201d", "Author": "appliepie2", "ReviewID": "UR10031533", "Content": "This hotel is in the centre of Las Ramblas and only 2 minutes from the everything.However, please be warned that the hotel is behind a red light district so ladies please be careful when walking home late at night!

I was extremely impressed with almost everything about the hotel, especially at the price we were paying. We managed to book the room around two months before for around \u00a350(75 euros) per night. The room was slightly smaller than I expected from the photos I had seen but it was by no means small. It was very clean upon our arrival and was cleaned every day we were there whilst we were out. Having read the reviews on trip asvisor I was worried about the noise and the staff, but the staff were very kind and would help with anything if you asked but I would say that if you make an effort to at least try and speak spanish then they tend to remember you and say hola when they see you, however they speak fluent english so it really isn't a problem. The noise was not a problem at all even though we had a room at the front with a balcony, I would say it was quite nice to wake up to the noise of the locals. The only bad thing about the hotel was the roadworks going on in front of it. It is based on a quiet street but the roadworks make it look ugly until you get inside. As for the city itself, it is beautiful. The pick-pocketting problem didn't affect us thankfully, but I would say as long as you're careful then it isn't a problem, so just take out what you need and leave the rest in the safe in your hotel room. The food tends to be rather expensive in most places on la ramblas and I found a few places where the drink prices were ridiculous but there are a few gems, however don't be fooled into going to the italian which offers a set menu for 6.50 euros, it was quite frankly the worst dining experience of my life. There best places we found to eat and drink where between the hotel and la carme st. Make sure you visit the cathedral nearby, and go to la sagrada familia which is just a quick metro journey away.

When I go to cities, I have a difficult task to find somewhere in a great location which is clean, comfortable, en suite, tv AND isn't over the odds money wise. This is the best example I've found. AIRPORT When arriving for the first time, when you get outside, go RIGHT! We turned left and wandered for a while wondering where the hell the train was. It's right and up the escalators. Buy a T10 ticket. You can legitimately share them and gives you 10 journeys for a discounted rate. Don't be fooled by other tourists not buying them - they just don't know about them. You don't need to speak Spanish to buy them - the automated machines display in English and even if that fails, \"T-10\" is easy to spot. You can use these T10's all week on the metro. MUGGING Warned by a million (or so) people before I went. We didn't get mugged - although the Scottish woman in the cheese shop (see below) did say \"If they don't get you when you arrive, they'll get you when you leave\". I think most people should be fine if you just do some simple things. Keep your wallet in your pocket -when it's crowded or you're on the metro, keep your hand on it. Be aware of who's around you - if you have a backpack, wear it on your front. If you're in a restaurant, keep your bag on your lap or twist the handle round your foot. As long as you don't drop your \"sensible\" rather than \"obsessive\" guard - you should be fine. If you're lucky enough to be travelling with someone, keep an eye on each other's stuff. We put the large camera we had in an ordinary looking shoulder bag for safety. And always keep a spare card etc back at the hotel. HOTEL Comfortable beds, bath, shower, LCD television, good maid service, kettle and cups (we provided t-bags and milk). There is a safe, but didn't use it. Just kept things in our bags with a token padlock. That was me being obessive rather than feeling there was a danger of anything being taken. LITTLE SHOP To purchase small things like milk, water, choclate, sweets etc please go to a little shop - you turn left out of the hotel and then right and it's just on the right a little way down. It's a long thin shop. The lady in there is SO welcoming. She didn't have enough change one day for some stuff we bought and she waved us and with the goods and said to pop in another time. We did the next day and she looked so pleased. Glad to show her tourists are good people. BREAKFAST We only had breakfast once and it was average. MUCH better is to go to Bar Ra. Take a left out of the hotel; cross the road and go past the chairs (small square) on left and up towards what looks like a car park. Keep walking straight on. On t'other side of the car park is a great place for English Breakfast and it's good value too. Highly recommend. Yum. Doesn't open until 10 mind you. DINNER NEAR BY In terms of food - Blue Rita is a great place to have a beer and steak. Out of the hotel turn left, turn right and then turn right into the big square on the right - Blue Rita is tucked into the corner. LA RAMBLA BEER Warning - DO not have a drink on La Rambla - we did and it cost 18 euros!! CHEESE You must go to the Cheese shop run by a Scottish woman. 5 euros gets you two small glasses of her wine and three pieces of cheese to taste. DELICIOUS!

The bathroom was mammouth with a crazy shower thing that shot water out at every direction you could want.! As for the shower doors i don't know what all the fuss was about! We had a good breakfast there everyday with plenty of fruit, cereal, pastries, yoghurt, ham, cheese, bread etc to choose from. There was also some hot stuff but in that weather i couldn't face it. The A/C in the rooms was a god send and worked perfectly. It was in a great location just 3 mins from La Ramblas and although not in the nicest area it wasn't scary . The next street over had lots of girls loitering and we got a bit lost round there but i didn't feel threatened. And its very close to a metro station as well which was brilliant. All in all i thought for the money we paid it was a real find and very good value for money. I'd maybe stay further over into the Gothic Quarter next time i visit but that'd probably hike the price up.

There is a key card that activates the lights, and also activates the red light on the outside of the door. We had a late morning one day and were not disturbed by house-keeping as they could see that we were still in the room. Great when you need a bit of a lie-in! We had no problems with dogs in the area, all the dogs we saw belonged to someone and were well behaved. We never felt threatened or concerned when walking to the hotel at night, and wouldn't describe the area as seedy. The area is slightly off the bright lights of La Rambla and doesn't attract many tourists and has loads of character. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as there are so many options around the area so can't comment on the standard of food.

I also paid for breakfast and compared to some other hotels I've stayed in in Europe, there wasn't that much choice of food. Despite the above, there were some plus points to the hotel. It was clean and the free internet access was a bonus. The hotel was ideally located away from the noise of La Rambla; all the main tourist attractions were within easy walking distance. Apart from having a two day pass on the Tourist Bus (two days are definitely better value for money as each tour takes two hours), I walked everywhere else. Before I went to Barcelona, everyone said it was very notorious for pick-pocketing. As a single, female traveller I was orginally worried about this and also, El Raval (the area where the hotel is situated) has a bit of a dodgy reputation. I did have heightened wariness about this and especially as my mum's purse was stolen literally within minutes of us being in Rome earlier this year.
