The hotel's location is unsuitable for anything else! I travelled to Istanbul and stayed there for 5 nights in March 2012. On arrival I found the toilet in my room in awfull condition, with yellow stains on the seat and brown water at the bottom!!! Of course I reported it to the reception and they made sure it was properly cleaned. Other than that the hotel itself seems very good and complete, with spacious rooms, friendly staff, swimming pool and fitness center, and with a very good restaurant inside. However, despite all the luxury, it is realy just a big concrete block with no particular views - all I could see from my room was a 12-lane motorway folowed by the airport's runway (I think the other side is even worse). If you plan to travel downtown and maybe do some shopping you must avoid staying there because there is nothing worth seeing and doing around it. One night I took a taxi to the Bosphorus and took about 90 minutes to get there (a result of both the distance and the infamous Istanbul traffic). However if the purpose of your trip is situated near the airpot or the exhibitions around it, it is very convenient. Two things to have in mind are: a) in the evenings the motorway to and from the hotel is packed with cars, which is why many taxi drivers will NOT want to take you there and b) it is TOO close to the airport and the exhibitions, which again may result in taxi drivers not willing to take you for such a short distance. So overall a pretty good hotel but only as a stop-over or if your work is nearby.

The hotel told me every half hour when I called to enquire so thank goodness I caught it fairly quickly. Check in was a disaster as there was an entire lobby full of TK passengers they were accomodating whose flight must have been cancelled. Not the hotel's fault obviously, but the wait to check in was an eternity behind this group. The reception agent was however very pleasant when I got to the front. The room was adequate, but nothing particularly special. Dinner at the one restaurant in the hotel was subpar and the service was exceedingly slow, so that is a minus. Breakfast, as is typical of airport hotels, always seems to start long past the time folks need to be at the airport in the morning, so I didn't partake.

Otherwise I would have to move my room to another tower and use a cable for the internet. I told them that I did not want this and that I was very unsatisified by such a shocking ommission in a hotel charging 135 Euro per night. I also asked for the Night Manager to call me. He never did, although I waited until 11:30 for the call...... The next day, I complained again to the front desk to see if I could be moved closer to the internet. They told me that the 2nd tower had wonderful wireless internet and that they would move me and upgrade my room. This is exactly the opposite of what the clerk on duty on Wednesday night told me..... Fool that I am, I packed up my room and moved to the new tower. Guess what, same poor wireless internet. The original room was actually quite nice and the upgraded room was not really much of an improvement. Funny how the staff all knew to ask the guests if they wanted to upgrade to business class rooms for and extra 45 Euro per night, but no one seems to know the shoddy state of their IT infastructure.

I rarely feel the need to write reviews because I generally tend to agree with the majority of reviewers but this time I had a rather different experience than the majority. We booked this hotel because this was the site of my husband's work conference, so I was a bit wary about booking this hotel, particularly after reading the reviews. Well... to my immense surprise and great pleasure, I loved this hotel! And after talking to other conference attendees, all appeared to share the same sentiment. Regarding the look of the hotel, I was expecting some old shabby looking lobby. Instead, what I got, was an ultra-modern, minimalist looking lobby in tones of black, white and red. The lobby couches were very comfortable and not at all dreary. Our rooms were quite large, very clean and had all the modern amenities one could want from a 5-star hotel. My only complaint was the rock hard mattress. In all, while this hotel doesn't reflect a traditional ottoman furnishing, it was crisp, impeccably clean and elegant Regarding the shuttle bus, yes its true there is only a shuttle every hour, but while I was waiting for the shuttle at the airport (and by the way, it always arrived on time) I also noticed the schedule for all the other airport hotels shuttles, including the Courtyard, Holiday Inn and the Sheraton and they also had ourly shuttles, so no difference there. We did the trip into the Old Town 4 times with public transport, and yes it took us over an hour to get there, but public transport is safe and easy and in rush hour traffic it may actually beat a taxi ride. Breakfast was another pleasant surprise. The choice was plentiful and varied. This included about 8 different types of breakfast breads, pastries, cakes, yogurt (with various toppings), an egg station serving made-to-order omelets, scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, various fruits and vegetables, french toast, pankakes and traditional turkish items. In short, they had something to suit any palate. The pool and gym were somewhat dissapointing and were rather dark and unwelcoming, but they still contained the basic amenities of any gym.

The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd always tries to be positive ! OK - - let me start with the positives. It is very near the Istanbul (Aratuk) airport. Apart for the actual hotel within the airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it must be the closest. It is a 10 minute (max) taxi ride for 5 Euros (7 max). So if like me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you are here for only 20 hours and do not savour the prospect of the plastic and metal chairs in Istanbul airport\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I rest my case ! My room (101) is lovely. Very spacious, plasma TV with 30 channels (2-3 English, including BBC World service), massive king size bed (all for me !), pillows to die for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sooo soft!, air con (that does not seem to work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it is cold here; so maybe on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd permanently ?), utterly spotless including bathroom, iron and iron table, fridge, kettle (cups and free tea/coffee/whitener), mood lighting (low if you want and plenty of light to work by if required). AND a major plus - - a massive window that opens wide for fresh air !!. Lovely ! All staff I met \u00e2\u20ac\u201c concierge, check-in and restaurant were most courteous and welcoming. Nice. I have seen comments on this hotel about aircraft noise. I think my room is more to the back of the hotel - - so apart from the odd distant rumble of aircraft - the only noise is the local kids kicking a football around in a nearby park.. And the Iman of the local Mosque \u00e2\u20ac\u201c singing (rather badly !) at various hours through a Tannoy. But to me that is fun ! Ah well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Now for the not so good: 1. The hotel should inform guests the pick-up times and locations of their (free) shuttle bus at the Airport. I stood for 40 minutes on the footpath outside the airport in a general Hotel Shuttle bus pick-up zone, before a local man (for a 1 Euro tip) told me - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh that bus never comes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (!) And got me a local (yellow) taxi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for a 7 Euro fare to the hotel ! 2. Then \u00e2\u20ac\u201c honestly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I am paying 150 Euros for one night in here. In no way is it worth that. The Hotel is situated right next to a 12 lane highway (airport and through roads), next to a grubby local shopping area [selling what my dear father would have termed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tatt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd]. There is no way you would chose to stay here apart for airport-access expediency ! Maybe 90 Euros \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no more. Do not consider this for a romantic getaway !! 3. To add to the cost - the mini bar prices are nothing short of diabolical ! One example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one 500 ml bottle of water is 2.50 Euros !! I walked next door (walk out hotel front door and go right for 100 metres) to the Shell service station. And bought 2 x 1.5 litre bottles of chilled water and 1 small can of Coke for 1.75 Euros !! By the way - - that service station has all sorts of choccie bars and nibbles, too ! At local (realistic) prices ! 4. Oh \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as previously reported - the WiFi in the rooms is AWFUL. It cuts out every 30 seconds. It is quite unusable in the room ! I seriously complained about this on departure. Go to the large foyer area (lobby level) and it works fine ! 5. I ate dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. WOW ! On the one hand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the risotto with grilled veg and soft white cheese was truly beautiful (10 Euros). BUT to pay 8 Euros for a small bottle of local beer !!! They really have rocks in their head. Utter rip-off. Now I know why the waiter could not find the drinks menu !!! Not his fault. But Radisson management really have to consider these ridiculous prices ! To sum up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If you really need to stay near Istanbul airport for one night. OK. Any more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no way. If you want to eat and drink in this hotel (without negotiating an additional bank loan) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c forget it !

It would be nice if they gave a continental breakfast option and included it with the room booking. 5) Seemed to have a nice fitness area - and although we missed out on the swimming pool (again, a language issue - we thought we had more time than we had - it closes at 10 PM), it looked nice, but small. 6) Checkout had a couple of hiccups - a few charges for things we didn't think we should be charged for - but the front desk staff was great about fixing those issues. And then they went out and found us the two taxis we needed to get back to the airport as we couldn't wait for the shuttle (which runs from the hotel on the hour). Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives. It is a fine place for an overnighter when you aren't looking to see the city. Obviously, if you want to actually see Istanbul, you could do much better by going into the heart of the city.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cSerious rip off\u201d", "Author": "Sakko", "ReviewID": "UR37594374", "Content": "This is the most serious rip off we have come across.

The fan turns on and you are greeted with the noise of an airplane and/or a blast of hot air, that cannot be controlled. Forget trying to open a window. You can't. The hotel advertises internet. You can send a letter in the mail faster than what their system will send. As per other readers and the prices of food, VERY expensive and no service at all. The health club is mediocre at best. There are numerous treadmills and good brand exercise machines. No maintenance is done on them, so be aware of faulty equipment. The good part?

Okay - no one stays in an airport hotel for fun. It's the 4am check-in that brings us here - but I have stayed in numerous comfortable, friendly, sometimes charming, occasionally stylish airport hotels. This is not any of the above. The exterior is the standard squat, internationalist architecture - but not immediately giving a sense of foreboding. Once through the revolving door, however\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 No architect - even in the dim recesses of the 1970s -could have thought this soulless atrium, devoid of style, ornamentation, colour, anything, an appropriate lobby. The central bar, a pair of wooden tiki huts seemed laughably out of place. The (polite) receptionist could not find my reservation, but having done so placed me in a twin-room (I had specifically asked for a king), the bell-hop had me moved\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Service is - at best - desultory. The shop was closed and would reopen \"in an hour or so\", in the meantime I was advised that I could get what I needed \"in the gas station down the road\". The airport shuttle mentioned on their website no longer runs - I don;t mind paying for a cab, but it would be nice to know. And what kind of airport hotel doesn't run a shuttle - after all, they run one to their sister hotel in downtown Istanbul. Breakfast is from 6.30 (a little pointless when your check-in is at 6) and the bar and restaurant for this captive audience is grotesquely expensive. On the plus side, the staff are courteous, the room is spacious (though the beige with orange tubular furniture recalls a 70s office), and the Wi-Fi free (though confusingly the note in the room says it has to be paid for).

The fact it was a Radisson attracted me, as I am not a frequent user of the chain, prefrerring Marriott every time, so I gave it a go. BIG Mistake. I paid \u00c2\u00a3105 for a standard room, which is not particularly cheap, expecting a 5 star experience. If this is 5 star it is in breach of Trade Descriptions. Here are my experiences; 1. The receptionist checked me in, but never stopped talking on the phone while he did it. 2. The Hotel is on a motorway (Yes DIRECTLY on a motorway), with nothing either side of it but a Shell garage. 3. The room was dated, drab and dirty. There were cigarette burns in the carpet (This was a Non smoking room!), the fabric of the desk chair was worn and stitched together, and the beds were about one foot of the ground, with pillows (sorry, pillow) about 3 inches thick. They were single (and I mean single) beds. The last time I slept in a bed like this was in my Mums house when I had my own room for the first time and a handed down bed from my sister! I had just come from the Marriott Amman, a double room there consists of two DOUBLE beds, with 4 very large pillows per bed, and even a two inch thick mattress protector. 4. They gave me one room key. This key also operates the room safe. Problem is, it also operates the lights. Guess what. When you take the key from the holder by the door, the lights go out. So you can't see the safe to open it. Therefore you must get someone to hold open the door to shine in some light, take the key from the holder 'click' off go the lights, and then try to find what you want from your dark abyss. 5. The bathroom was horrible. Everyone likes a nice clean hotel bathroom. Two pet hates of mine are brown discoloured grout/Sealant, and no plug in the sink, just a black hole full of previously spat toothpaste and hair. This room had both. Why no plug in the sink of a 5 star hotel? 6. Lastly, and this is the big one. PRICES PRICES PRICES. Are they kidding!!! Exchange rate was YTL1.70 to 1 Euro. My minibar was priced as follows Local beer 12 YTL (7 euro or \u00c2\u00a35 GBP for 33cl) Whiskey 25 YTL (15 euro or \u00c2\u00a310 GBP for 5cl Peanuts 20 YTL (12 euro or \u00c2\u00a38 GBP for PEANUTS!!!!!!) The bar downstairs was priced even higher, so two small beers would set me back twenty quid!!. Stuff it, I took a cab to the nearest supermarket, bought 6 cans of 50 cl beer, some crisps and peanuts and chocolate, and came back. The cost including a return cab fare - 25 euro. I got all this and the cab ride for the same price as two 33cl beers from my minibar. You get the picture!! It seems that its remote location is deliberate to make you spend excessively as a captive. The disgruntled look i got from the security guard as I passed through the scanner and was searched seemed also to suggest this. ; \"Not good - outside food - not good OK go! \") Lastle, there is a selection of shops in the hotel. I passed by slowly looking in the windows, when suddenly a deranged man leapt at me, dragging me towards his wares. \"Come you must look, come!!!.\" When I refused he followed me from his shop, into the reception, shouting virtual abuse at my lack of interest. I had to scuttle away looking behind me to see he was gone. Good 5 star hotel experience eh! Friend and fellow travellers, I eat sleep and breath travel, planes hotels taxis restaurants for business and leisure, so please believe me this is one grotty dump, if you want to be relieved of a few hundred quid for an overnight stay with a meal (in the ONE restaurant - don't like Italian - tough!), go ahead, or do as I will do next time guys, stay some place else.
