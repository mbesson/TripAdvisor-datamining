{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Basic Business Hotel but close to Tokyo University Kizankan is not the most convenient for most tourists, but it's fine if you need to be near Tokyo University and want to be able to catch a Metro, or if you're attending something at Tokyo Dome and everything around there is booked up. It's on a very quiet side street near the University and a couple of blocks from the Hongo-san-chome station. Tokyo Dome is one stop away. The restaurant was unexciting but plenty of places to eat nearby.The single rooms are small as is typical of business hotels, but clean. The front desk staff was very helpful (no English spoken, none needed).", "Date": "Jun 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR290935614", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RogerR-Phila"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066442-d633001-r16773556-Hotel_Kizankan-Bunkyo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "633001", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
