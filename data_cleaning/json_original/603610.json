I said we had to choose as I had seen the reviews and overall I was not looking forward to this stay...what an amazing surprise! From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with an honest smile. The front desk staff was extremely courteous and they ensured our room was assigned in line with our reservation requests. As we travel with kids, we always order additional towels when checking in, and it usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes to receive them if we are lucky. The moment we walked into our room we found the housekeeper placing additional towels...that is quick and efficient service. At all points of contact, every staff member kept asking us if we needed anything else so they could take immediate action. The room was extremely clean, I can say hospital-like clean. Comfortable and very cozy. The food ordered from room service was surprisingly good, served exactly as requested, at the right temperature and brought promptly by a very friendly staff member. Yes, the food is expensive (about CAD$4.00 for a can of soda), but you also pay for the convenience as the closest restaurant is about 1 mile away. I do not complain about these prices, as they are available for you to see before you order, so at the end it is your choice to take it or not. It was worthy and convenient for me and my family. Location is not the best if you do not have a car and if you are a tourist. However, after my previous horrible experience at NH Hotel in Mexico City, I strongly recommend Camino Real Pedregal as the perfect place to relax and enjoy a clean room with outstanding service.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "manzanillo, mexico", "Title": "\u201cexpensive and lacklustre\u201d", "Author": "golfing10", "ReviewID": "UR115918557", "Content": "Do not be fooled by a seemingly good room rate in comparison to toher neighboring hotels.

For such a new hotel, the rooms seemed quite dirty. There were food smudges on the wall, and what looked like blood or some other dark matter smudged above the bathroom light switch. And there were many spills and stains on the floor. The bathroom sink had water stains on it, which suggested that it had been cleaned incompletely. Contrary to other reviews, I found the service quite friendly, if a bit inconsistent at times. Some services seemed incomplete--I never saw signs or indications of the pool that was advertised on the website, and the restaurant's prices were ridiculous. $35 for breakfast?? This isn't the Waldorf Astoria, and they could charge $15 and still keep out the riffraff. Good thing I was on an expense account. The hotel is in an extremely safe--but completely isolated and automobile dependent--part of town. I was lucky to have a driver, but if you don't you'll be spending lots of money on cabs, and will have to drive at least 30 minutes to go anywhere interesting. The nearest good night/dining spot is Charco de las Ranas (\"croak of the frogs\"). My hosts obviously wanted me to stay safe, but I would have traded some safety to be closer to the major sites. One other complaint is that the Internet speeds and connectivity were atrocious. I paid $12.95/day for internet (I had to go to the front desk to get a new password EVERY DAY), and I would lose my connection regularly. I almost asked for a refund.

This time we spent 1 night and got a very good price (aproximately $140 US for 3 pax) through Expedia although the rate they have posted on reception is $400 US !!! They claim to be a 5 star hotel which is overstaing the truth by at least a star and a half . The room had large stains all over the carpet which immediately gave the impression of dirt and since the hotel is widely used by the Angeles Hospital next door we did not even want to think about what the stains might be. The bathroom only had ONE hand towel although we had paid a U.S $40 surcharge for our daughter to share the room. and nobody ever showed up to turn back the beds which had enough bedding on them for Alaska in December. Our main complaint was that the a/c did not work: Since it was up in the 90\u00c2\u00b0s the a/c not working quickly became an issue and we called reception for help and they said they would send somebody from maintenance. We waited and waited and eventually fell asleep as we had driven for 5 hours and my daughter had got off a 14 hour flight. None of us slept for long and sweated it out all night. The \"courtesy\" coffee in the room cost $35 MXP and we were astonished on checking out to be charged a 10% service charge on the coffee that we ourselves had made. We refused to pay it on principle. We also called for the duty manager to complain about the a/c and he was completely did-interested and never bothered to apologise. It is a constant problem in Mexico that the customer is NEVER right.

I was there for two full weeks. The room was very well-kept with a huge window and a beautiful view out to the mountains. It was thoroughly cleaned and restocked every day, and the staff were very friendly when I ran into them. I had some initial problems getting connected to the internet, and I was disappointed to find that the fees were not included in the price of the room (this is unclear on their site). It ended up being roughly $10/day for internet, and I had to call the front desk every day to request a new username and password. I don't speak Spanish, which could have been why I had a hard time explaining what I needed. Enough of the staff spoke English pretty well, but certainly not all did. The restaurant on the second floor, Maria Bonita, is a taverna style restaurant with good food and a nice bar. The first floor restaurant is an Italian bistro that I only ate at once, and it was decent. You can also order any of the menu as room service - they were very prompt and I had some delicious room-service meals. The food at both is probably more expensive than local places (especially at the bistro), but not bad for a hotel. Online sources about the hotel are vague about the existence of a pool (I never found it) and a convenience store on site. I think both used to exist, but I'm not sure if either still does. You do have to pay for bottled water (although their water from the tap is filtered), but that's fairly typical at U.S. hotels so I wasn't surprised by it.

I did have a little trouble getting the internet to work at first, but eventually I figured it out with help from the front desk (and realizing that the wireless worked better than the wired).

It did help that I speak Spanish, so I can't say how well the staff speak English, but after expecting a horrible stay from the other reviews, I was pleasantly surprised at having a very nice stay.

I decided to give the Camino Real Pedregal a second chance because the hotel itself was nicer than my other options. Again, I left feeling ripped off and cheated. The stay did not start out well. When I arrived to the hotel I was told I did not have a reservation. Only upon production of a printout of my confirmation were they willing to help find the reservation. The entire process took about 30 minutes. My room was on the 30th floor. The hotel has 33 floors. Floor numbering starts at 21. I don't know why they number the floors this way. The room was fine, as expected, just like the last time. There was no bottled water in my room, though. Whatever. This did become an issue later on. Coffee is MXN30 per satchet as detailed in other reviews. I wouldn't mind paying if it was good coffee. But, it's not. At check out I was told that I consumed a bottle of water, and was charged almost MXN90 (USD$9.00). This was because when they put a fresh bottle of water in my room to replace the one that was never there, they probably charged me for it. They did take this off. However, I also disputed the room rate. The hotel confirms their rates in US DOLLARS. Then, they charge you a rate in Mexican Pesos, that is FAR in excess of any established exchange rate. They think you will miss this, and then leave. If they confirmed their rates in Mexican Pesos, and I agreed to the rate, fine. But, they quote their rates in US Dollars, and should charge you what you were confirmed. This is standard offer and acceptance. But, this hotel engages in \"bait and switch\" tactics. I argued with the clerk, but they refused to budge. I am going to be disputing the charge with my credit card company and will NEVER stay at this hotel again. They are crooks.
