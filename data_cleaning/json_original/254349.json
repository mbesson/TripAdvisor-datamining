I booked the room through their website using their 14-day advance non-refundable rate, and I was only charged approximately CAN$110 per night, which was quite a bargain! I have read the reviews of this property on Tripadvisor, and I was prepared for the worst. Upon checking in and entering our room, however, we were all REALLY impressed! When we arrived, the valet parking was full, but the attendant kindly directed us to a parking garage nearby, which was connected to the hotel by an elevator. The lobby was small but quite elegant, and the check-in process was quick and simple. Our apartment unit was HUGE, that I almost could not believe it! It was certainly more spacious than the floorplan they posted on the website, so they might have upgraded us. Nevertheless, we had a large closet space by the entrance, a dining area, a pull-out couch and a bedroom with sliding doors. The bathroom was so beautiful with stained glass lighting on the ceiling. One thing that really impressed me was how THOUGHTFUL and detail-oriented the hotel was. The pull-out mattress from the couch had a sheet and blanket on it. There were also extra pillows and blankets in the closet, should we require any. The kitchen was fully-equiped with pots, pans, plates, mugs, wine glasses, placemats and even sponges, dishwashing liquid and drying rack!! It really was like having your own place! There were also two TV sets and telephones - one in the living room and another in the bedroom area. Some users had complained about the air-conditioner, but we did not have any problem with ours, so they must have fixed it. There was a thermostat in the room, so we could adjust the temperature to our liking. The location of the hotel could not be any better. We were right next to the Sherbrooke subway station, which made travelling very easy and convenient. We were also surrounded by nice little shops and restaurants around the area. At night, the hotel was quiet and tranquil enough for a comfortable snooze. To be fair, the hotel was definitely not a five-star, and there were many signs of wear and tear everywhere. I found marks and streaks on the wall and the curtains, and the overall decor was not luxurious. They had an indoor pool which was somewhat dimly lit, and the water was SO COLD. I also used the exercise room, which was tiny and basic, but it was well-maintained and modern. Overall, I was very impressed with this property, and I would certainly recommend it. For the price we paid and the amenities we received, I think it was a superb deal. My suggestion would be to try getting their advanced purchase rates from their website.

I thought that it would be the perfect place for a family of 5 ( two adults and three kids). I was totally wrong, we arrived and as one reviewer stated earlier the main door is locked so one thinks we are at the wrong place but the actual entrance is next door. They do have ballet parking and its $15 no choice, which is fine because most places dont have parking, especially in downtown. This hotel is located close to downtown and there is a walking distance to down town. And getting to downtown I mean walking down a street, so if you are not used to walking or if you are traveling with kids I would recommend taking your own trasportation or taking the metro which is located next to the hotel. The room was very, very, very small for our three kids to even move around. The kitchen was even smaller than the bathroom, the sofa bed was torn and the furniture was scratched and outdated, the room was clean but we were dissappointed. To make things worse the room was not cooling so we asked the front desk to change us to another room and it was still the same, hot, so we decided to sleep with the window open. Also, there is a note in the kitchen that says that you must leave the kitchen the same way as it was otherwise there is a 25.00 charge.

The good: Our Junior Deluxe Suite was very enjoyable, and I would probably stay here again. We were there for a week to see the sights. The room had a separate bedroom with non-locking sliding doors (opaque window panes), a sofa bed, a bathroom (with two entry points) and a full kitchen. Did I mention 2 televisions? Very handy to have with such diverse members of our family. Check in was a little confusing, but ultimately quick and efficient. Although there is a sign that clearly says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153La Presidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it shares the building with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DoubleTree\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. To check in, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother going in the door under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153La Presidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign. Just go directly to the door under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DoubleTree\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and check in at the front desk there. Be sure that they know that you are with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153La Presidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to find your reservation. The air conditioning worked great throughout the room. We were able to borrow an internet cable with a deposit of $50. Except for one day, the internet connections were fast and reliable. The kitchen was perfect, full stove/range top, full fridge, micro, toaster, coffee maker, plates, glasses, coffee cups, silverware, cooking utensils, etc. If you are traveling with little kids, you may want to bring along plastic cups to prevent breakage. The only other things I bought on my own were paper towels (none provided), Ziploc bags to store leftovers, and our own food. The biggest supermarket we could find is on the corner of St. Hubert & Ontario \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about a 5-minute walk downhill. You just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat the convenience of being able to whip up a quick meal for the little ones at the drop of a hat! Adults could always wait a while, but kids somehow forget to tell you they are hungry until they are STARVING. Also, if anyone has a special diet, they should pack what they need instead of hoping you can find it nearby. Housekeeping was very efficient, and the place was spotless every time. The pool downstairs was small, but perfect for our young kids to splash around in, especially after a long, hot day of sightseeing. One end was about 3 feet deep, the other end about 5.5 feet deep. We visited the pool almost daily, and the level of crowdedness varied each day. If you are a lap swimmer, you may want to visit early in the morning or late at night, otherwise, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just be dodging other swimmers, kids playing, etc. The fitness center was small (just 2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, 1 bike, 2 weight benches, various hand weights and several exercise balls) but clean and sufficient for that quick workout. One wall was entirely made of windows so that you could look out on part of Sherbrooke Street. There were also anti-bacterial wipes to wipe off equipment after use, fresh towels, and a water machine. The Sherbrooke Metro was located within the same block of the hotel (along the Berri Street side of the hotel). Yes, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see the big Metro sign ACROSS the street, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to cross the street. The bad: There is a little sign in the kitchen that says you need to leave the kitchen exactly as you found it or else there would be a $25 charge. We cleaned everything, organized it all as best we could, but we left all of our leftover food in hopes that someone in the housekeeping staff would want it. Silly us! We were charged the $25. Service was not very reliable. We called housekeeping/front desk 3 times to have a rollaway delivered. It never arrived. Finally, the 3rd adult in our party decided to just sleep on the couch, as our kids were sleeping on the sofa bed mattress that we placed directly on the carpet. We ended up canceling the request. On another occasion, we could not get the water to turn on in the bath/shower. All of the other faucets worked fine, the toilet flushed, etc. So, we called the front desk and they said they would send someone right away. Again, after several calls, still no visit. Finally, we asked if we were the only ones with this problem or if it affected the whole building. It was a problem for the whole building! If they had just told us that at the start, we would have been more understanding.

I was meeting with a large group of people so I splurged and got the presidential suite. My main consideration in picking this hotel was for it to be in downtown, near the metro and to have a spacious room with a seperated bedroom area. At $250 a night it was a great bargain in my opinion. You get two bedrooms a living area and a kitchen. One of the most spacious places I've stayed at thats for sure. The hotel was easy to find although it does share the building with a doubletree, so it wasnt that readily apparent that La Presidence is in the same building. They had a door that said the hotel name but it was locked and there was construction going on in there. So when I initially got there I was kind of worried about that. I eventually sorted it out though. Checking in also had its snag, they gave me a room that was under construction at first. I had to go back down and get another room. Under most circumstances I would have been annoyed but they swiftly resolved it and were very accomidating. Also they give you a warm cookie when you check in.. that was a nice touch and probably one of the reasons I didnt have a chip on my shoulder. In regards to the room, it was spacious and clean. Kitchen was well equipped and the bathroom had a hot tub that i didnt use. The bedrooms had alot of closet space and good roaming room. The beds were large and fairly comfortable, however my only gripe about them was that for a bed so large the pillows seemed inadequate. they were just too small and flimsy. I figure for a room that is labeled as a presidential suite it should give you either more pillows or a few throw pillows or something. It just felt bare. I will probably stay there again in future montreal visits.

On arrival the staff took my Big SUV (Height does not fit in most garages) and found a space for it. Many hotels have left it to me to find parking. Check in was smooth and the free breakfast tickets were a nice surprize. Then I went to my Executive Suite and WOW was I surprized. It was beautifully laid out, spacious, and easily as nice as any suite I have been in for 2 to 3 times the costs. The Maid obliged my timing for room cleaning, room service was quick and cordial. The Bath was large and roomy with a 2 person tub :) King bed was super comfortable. TV's were large and easy to operate with plenty of cable channels. The Resturant is Magnificent and eggs are to order. Service was impecable like I am used to in the finest resturants in the city. The kitchen was large and had everything you will need to prepare meals and snacks, plus free coffee. The Price was right and they have many smaller suites if you want to save a few additional dollars. It is located NEAR St Denis for Shopping and sightseeing and St Laurant for Clubbing and Dining. The negatives are minor but for balance I will tell you to bring a cord for your computer as WIFI is not in suites. Cord works fine. Some of the furniture is a bit KMart-ish, good looking but could stand an upgrade. Totally acceptable for the room rate.

Elevators, common areas of larger hotel were shopworn and dirty (although signs promise a multi-million $$ renovation). The concierge at the separate La Presidence entrance was \"on a break\" so we had to check in amidst long lines at the Crowne Plaza. Parking was $19!! Breakfast was included in our rate, served in hotel dining room, but it turned out it was a coupon good for only the \"cold\" continental breakfast, not any of the good stuff like eggs or pancakes. Our 10 year old started to cry so we paid $7.95 for an overpriced \"upgrade\" for his breakfast. Kind of a rip off. All in all, a very nice room in subpar surroundings.

Good internet pricing for a top-notch downtown Montreal hotel. The location is not too bad: within walking distance of downtown, and right on the Metro (subway). There are no shops or cafes in the immediate area, but lots of bars/restaurants on St. Denis (a 15-minute walk). The view was to the north, looking at the side of an adjacent highrise, and in sight of the landmark Mont Royal. Room was very clean and well-appointed. I had reserved a \"Senior Suite\" for my wife and teenage son (who got the sofabed). We were assigned Room 606 on the top floor of La Presidence's block of rooms. As you will read elsewhere, La Presidence is co-located with The Plaza and shares bar, restaurant, gym, etc. The higher floors are part of The Plaza Hotel. Gripe #1: the bathroom in 606 is accessible only via the bedroom. It's an \"ensuite\" layout. Thus teenage son needed to barge in through our bedroom in the dead of night to use the facilities. The floor plan on the web site shows the bathroom is accessed from common hallway, but such is not the case in Room 606. So if you are booking a suite with plans to have friends/family use the sofabed, be sure to ask for a room that does not have the en-suite bathroom. Gripe #2: other TripAdvisor reviews have mentioned an included continental breakfast. This has either disappeared from their offering, or was not made available to us, since we booked the \"lowest internet rate\" package. I asked about it at the front desk and was told the only breakfast was served in the restaurant. $19CDN for a very nice buffet. Gripe #3: the room did not have a spacious desk, large work area, nor could I find the promised high-speed internet connection. It had a tiny desk with poor lighting way at the end of a dark hallway, no power outlets, and an RJ-45 jack that was wired for dialtone (dial-up). The Hotel Services binder had no mention whatsoever about how to use the internet. No signs or guides in either offical language. This didn't really bother me since I was there for vacation, not to do e-mail and web surfing. I did not call the desk to enquire. It could be that the hi-speed jack was hidden away somewhere. There was no wireless internet in evidence -- I scanned for it. Gripe #4: The room was a little noisy for my tastes. There was a constant high-pitching whining sound coming from above. I suspect there is a utility room directly above Room 606 with circulating pumps or other mechanical apparatus. I am a light sleeper and have trouble accomodating to new hotel environments. At least it was a constant background sound, and not as disturbing as the heat pumps that cycle on and off constantly at some hotels. Surprise #1: as noted elsewhere, they want $19 for indoor parking. An extremely helpful and friendly bellman (David) told me to just park across the street on Sherbrooke. One can park there overnight and all day for free, except between 3:30pm and 5:30pm (rush hour). We were checking in just at 5:30 as the embargo lifted, so we scooted across the street and left the car until the next afternoon. Then moved it to a side street a block away. Side street parking is problematic at the best of times, but if you happen to be arriving at 5:30-6:00pm, chances are you can snag a spot right on Sherbrooke. Surprise #2: a very comfy, reclining leather-like rocking easy chair with matching footstool. The seating in hotels, even upscale ones, is often sub-par. A lumpy hide-a-bed sofa and perhaps an overstuffed side chair. This one was really comfortable - great for kickin' back, watching TV, reading the paper. Despite the gripes above, all-in-all I found this to be an excellent hotel. I would recommend it, though be sure to get a room without the \"ensuite\" bathroom setup if privacy is a concern. Room 606 has a strange layout, with a long wasted hallway, a huge walk-in front closet, and poor desk/work setup. I suspect it gets assigned to those who book the cheap Internet rate, or those who don't know better.

I just had a really good feeling. Five days later we headed to Montreal, upon arrival we checked in at The Crown Plaza reservation desk as both hotels share the same building. La Presidence occupies a few floors and has it's own elevator. We occupied a 1 bed room suite which was located on the back of the 3rd floor. (We didn't mind). The suite was beautiful with a full kitchen which consisted of stove with a huge microwave on top, toaster, coffee maker, electric kettle and a refridgerator and all the necessary utensils, and I have to add that everything was clean and spotless. There was a little breakfast nook for two, and the living room had beautiful drapes, a beautifully framed mirrow hung over the couch and there was a coffee table and television set and a leather armchair with ottoman (which every man needs) The bedroom has a desk, a table and a television as well, and is separated by a set of french doors. The bathroom was beautiful, spacious and had picture light over the bathtub (especially beautiful). We liked the location because we could walk 10 mins to the beautiful restaurants or jump on the metro (which is right around the corner) to see other parts of this beautiful city.

But the action on St. Denis is less than a five minute walk away. (Tip: go up a block on St. Denis to Park St-Louis, then head through park along a restaurant pedestrian mall to St. Laurent.) It's also a five minute walk to La Fontaine Park and only ten minutes to McGill University or to Old Town.", "Date": "May 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMy ideal type of hotel\u201d", "Author": "Eddy22", "ReviewID": "UR3228714", "Content": "Spent a couple of weeks here.

When we were fewer guests, we moved to a junior suite (one queen bed and a separate living room with a pull-out sofa bed) which worked nicely for a couple and one other person. La Presidence is contained within the Crowne Plaza Hotel, with a separate entrance and \"concierge\" desk, but you can take full advantage of the Crowne Plaza's facilities. It seems to be intended primarily for long-term guests, but works nicely for families or groups who want a kitchen and a little extra space. It's conveniently located -- two blocks from central bus station and a half-hour walk to Old Montreal. Their reservation system was not quite up to the task (there was a bit of confusion about our reservation when we arrived, but the reservation was eventually found and then we were given the key to a room that was already occupied and those who had already been assigned to the room returned to discover that their key card no longer worked after it was reassigned to us), but all problems were apologized for and cheerfully corrected. If you get a package that includes the \"deluxe continental breakfast for two\" -- and, like us, are more than two people, be forewarned that, at $13.75 plus gratuity for each additional guest, it may not be worth it. Also, note that they have their own website, lapresidence.com, and will match any price you find elsewhere and give you an additional 10% off.", "Date": "September 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ancaster", "Title": "\u201cReally worth a visit!!\u201d", "Author": "kdscott", "ReviewID": "UR2378923", "Content": "Wonderful hotel! Rooms provide excellent ammenities, full kitchen, amazing bath, and seperate bedroom and living areas! One complaint about the room though is how uncomfortable the mattress' are! Not the best for those of us with back problems! We had requested an early check-in for noon, however upon arrival found that the customer service rep we spoke to over the phone had not submitted the request for us! The staff, however, were quick to react and promptly upgraded our room so that we would be able to check-in. Staff is very helpful and polite!
