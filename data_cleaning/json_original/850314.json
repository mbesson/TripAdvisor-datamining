{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The Pelican is So So To Start, the owner of the Inn, Jim Behr, is cool. He made himself available at a really odd hour to ensure that we found the place. It is tucked in the hills amongst some homes and other Inns and Villas. We got there at like 3 in the morning and he lead us straight to bed. That was nice no paperwork or anything to deal with. In fact I simply paid with a credit card over the phone and there were NO hidden charges. He is a super nice guy. All be it sometimes hard to get a hold of. You can call but often you are left leaving a message and hoping he calls you back. We stayed in a small 2 bedroom apartment type which only lacked a full kitchen which was fine because after the good rates we could afford to eat out for our meals. The apartment accomidated 4 of us for only $401 after tax for 3 nights. No extra charges for extra people either. We had a fridge and microwave and even some plastic ware for eating. I loved how each room had its own AC because it got pretty hot. The apartment was clean for the most part. The shelving in the bathroom didn't look very clean. It just needed a bit of deep cleaning and the rugs on the floors had alot of stains which wasn't very appealing. On the morning of the 2nd day of our stay there was no water in our little apartment. That meant no showers or washing of hands. We couldn't even flush the toilet. This posed a problem when you wake up and the only thing you want to do is go to the restroom. I called Jim and didn't hear anything back. We finally just left and held it until we arrived at a place with a restroom. That was a bit inconvenient. Luckly we had family staying at a different hotel and they were nice enough to let us use theirs for the rest of that day. When we returned later on that night the water was working but we still hadn't heard from Jim. We were to leave the next morning early and just left the key in the room. I never did hear anything back from Jim about the water or how our stay was. I guess he assumed everything was ok. In the future I will try to dig a bit deeper and make sure the place is big enough to at least have a staff on hand if something goes wrong.", "Date": "Oct 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR546092237", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Emily20"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g264369-d850314-r21358272-Pelican_Estate_Inn-Rincon_Puerto_Rico.html", "HotelID": "850314", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
