They welcomed me with tea in the lobby and breakfast at 7.30, although check-in is not until 13.30, they rushed to get my room ready for me and I was fast asleep in a clean, comfortable and spacious room by 10.30am. After waking fairly late in the day, they then went out to get me take-out delivered to my room as room-service. You really couldn't ask for more.

There were just a few minor things that prevented this place from earning a perfect score. Your take away from reading this review, however, is that the Historia is a fantastic choice for your stay in Istanbul. First the great; Perfectly located in the Sultanahmet district of Istanbul with impressive views of the Bosphorus if your room has a balcony. My room was peaceful enough to make me not want to leave and look at anything else. Quite affordable. I actually spent the 1st part of my Istanbul vacation at a top US franchise \"Big Box\" business/luxury class hotel and that was very nice, well run with all the amenities that you would expect from that kind of property. And it was over twice what I paid at the Historia, witrhout the view or the local charm that the Historia delivered. Well run with professional, friendy manaagement and staff. Omar Sevgili, the Coordinator (which is Manager, I assume) is an impressive young entrepreneur with an excellent grasp of both the English language and the use of new media (Facebook, etc.).to promote his business. I'm a pretty cheap date as a hotel guest, but if I had required a lot of hand holding, I'm sure that the staff would have provided it. The breakfast buffet was very good, served in a discrete dinning room with garden terrace on the building's 2nd floor. Next the adequate; the property is clean and decently maintaned. Room service cleaned my room daily.; Towels and bathroom ameneties were acceptable. The building has a lift (elevator). It's not big, but it's perfectly adequate for getting up and down if you don't like stairs. It's not that you need to climb far anyway. My room was on the 6th floor, which is the top. That was two floors above the lobby and check in area, which is apparently street level (although it's listed as the 4th floor - building is on a hill, I guess). Room furnishings are not fancy, by any means,, but adequate and in good repair. Hot water was a little slow to get started in the evenings, probably because my room was on the top floor, but it did come. The shower faucet was a little tight, but functional. There were two available outlets in my room which, given the room size, was fine. There is also a train train that runs behind the property, but the train is electric and does not run that frequently (it's not the CTA), so noise was not a problem. Finally the needs some improvement section. The rooms are a bit small. My signle, while perfectly fine for me as a solo traveler, might have been a little tight quarers for two people. Thet could stand to upgrade their TV's from the old school 14\" CRT flea market jobs to flat panels, and their reception on some of the channels was spotty. Wasn't a big issue for me, though. They could use coffee makers in their rooms. Having to walk around in public without my first cup of coffee is a cruel act for everyone concerned. While my room was cleaned every day, the drinking glasses that I used were not replaced. All in all, I highly recommend the Historia. I will personally stay here again.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Excellent Value\u201d", "Author": "Andrew255103", "ReviewID": "UR120134421", "Content": "Myself and two friends stayed at the Hitstoria in Instanbul for a few nights of R&R in a business trip and we couldnt have been more pleased with the location of the hotel.

Negatives - The room was really small -the bed was against the wall so one of us had trouble getting in and out - The bed was really really creaky - The air conditioning kept going off we kept having to call to reception where they had to \"reset\" something - quite annoying at nighttime - The drains from the toilet really smelt and an application of bleach would not go amiss - The cleaner kept leaving the window open after she had been (probably to combat the above) we found this a bit of a security risk.

There was a convenient food street somewhere along the tram line (but i'm sorry i can't remember the street name). We loved one of the restaurants named Et-is. The trick is to ask the locals where they would eat. And they are usually very friendly if you ask nicely (and of course don't ask the restaurant owners standing out by the street because they'll point to their own shops). The Spica Bazaar is about 20 minutes away but well worth the walk. Look around the Grand Bazaar but do your shopping in the Spice Bazaar! Prices go down to half or a third of Grand Bazaar prices. Anyway, staff in Historia Hotel were wonderfully helpful and were happy to explain directions and point out places of interest on the map. They were always courteous and helpful and it was a delight to have a lovely outdoor verandah to eat breakfast at. We got basement rooms which aren't consistent.

The two of us (both girls) rather spontaneoulsy embarked on this trip and left completely unprepared (without even a guide-book), merely with some recommendations we had recieved from friends and a print out of the compact information on the sites from the hotel's website. But preparation was unnecessary. To our extremely pleasant surprise all our needs were taken care of by the outstandingly friendly hotel staff!! Transfer to the hotel from the airport was arranged and upon arrival on our first day we were booked onto a Bosphorus boat tour within minutes. This was a suggestion by the manager we didn't regret, because the sunny weather did change according to the fore-cast a day later. Furthermore the staff was always helpful in suggesting sights, routes and restaurants. The hotel's location is simply perfect - it is in the Sultanahmet district right by the Blue Mosque, the church of Saint Sophia, Topkap\u00c3\u00bd Palace, Basilica (Yerebatan) Cistern, Grand Bazaar and the Cemberlitas Hamam (which may be a disappointing experience for those familiar with western Spa's and thermal baths). The location definitely adds on to its charm -prayers are unlikely to be overheard. The hotel's amenities are simple and clean, the beds comfortable and the breakfast buffet rich. The price value ratio is excellent! Internet is available in the foyer. My friend and I left Istanbul with the most positive impressions (people were so friendly), the wish to return soon and the urge to recommend the friendly little Hotel Historia to all those wanting to go to Istanbul soon!

Easy to book via venere.com. The hotel is ideally located in a small cul de sac in Sultanamhet. This is only a few minutes walk from Haghia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Cavalry Bazaar, Mosaics Museum etc and lots of small restaurants, bars, shops. Our rooms overlooked the Bosphorus and one had a small balcony on which we drank the occasional bottle of wine and watched the sun go down. All these plus points mean that the area can be noisy on occasion - there is a railway close by but we did not find this a problem. The rooms are small but very clean. The beds were good as were showers. Plenty of hot water. Downsides for some might be the small size, there is no chair (only a stool to sit at) and no tea / coffee facilities in the rooms. Breakfast is a buffet in a downstairs patio from 7.30 to 10.30. There is plenty to eat and quality is OK rather than outstanding. There is no lunch or dinner but as the place is surrounded with such establishments (we liked the Cafe Sofa about 30 yards away) that is not a problem. There is free internet in front lobby and a small bar. Staff are very friendly and helpful though, like most Turks, their English is not up to dealing with anything very out of the ordinary so you need to allow time for those exlanations. (On the other hand my Turkish comprises about a dozen words). There is a lift to all floors except the top one. In summary, an excellent hotel for sightseeing but you are not getting, or paying for, luxury. If you need space and quiet then you should look elsewhere.

The only comment I would make about the area is that there are many carpet showrooms around the hotel and you will be approached by salesmen. However, I am a solo woman traveler, and I did not feel unsafe at any time walking around this area of the city. I stayed at this hotel twice -- at the beginning and at the end of my tour of Turkey. My comments are the same for both stays. Bear in mind, I am a budget traveler and tend to stay in less comfortable hotels, so my standards are simply a safe, clean, comfortable place to sleep and bathe. Therefore, if you require 5 stars, you may not agree with my review. Room clean and very comfortable, spacious by European standards. Small tub, but comfortable enough for a shower if somewhat awkward to get in to. Plenty of hot water. Very good breakfast spread, nice variety. Firm, but comfortable beds; crisp linens; and towels big enough to fit around a large woman like myself -- but I found those things to be the same in all of the hotels I stayed at in Turkey. However, the selection of TV channels in English was the best of all the hotels at which I stayed in Turkey. Decor was pleasing. The pillows were good, too.
