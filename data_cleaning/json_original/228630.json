You can walk everywhere and you are right near the Temple of Debod which is the most amazing place I have ever sunbathed in Europe. 2. The rooms - spacious, clean, everything you need; quiet; really comfy beds - I have slept like I was at home and when the rooms are cleaned in the morning they are immaculate. 3. Free gym with enough to keep those churros pounds off In summary - this hotel has been perfect - it is so much more personal than the business hotels and yes reception could be more personable but to be frank they are there to do a job and they do it perfectly well.

Although it was centrally located on Gran Via, and reasonably clean and appointed, I found the service patchy, and I really didn't sleep well. SERVICE: when I arrived, the keycard for my room did not work owing to some problem with their computer system. The man on reception was polite enough about it, but didn't attend to it with any obvious urgency (which would have been nice for someone who was coming from the airport and quite tired). The keycard failed on another occasion while I was there. These were minor, but irritating inconveniences. When I was leaving, I deposited my luggage for a little shopping before going back to the airport. When I returned to collect it, there was a huge queue of people building up, and the staff on reception were quite relaxed about it. Needing to rush off to get my plane, I was a bit annoyed to see that the staff were having a very pleasant little chat with each person. Madrilenos are very friendly - and that's why it's nice to go there - but maybe this behaviour is not so appropriate at busy times. SLEEP: I stayed on the 7th floor. The walls were extremely thin, meaning that I could hear, through one wall, the bleep of the lift, and through most of the walls the noise of people passing my room to go to theirs (at all hours, this being Madrid). A further problem is noise from the connecting doors along the corridors. All the connecting doors are on a magnetic switch, which keeps them open during the day, but they swing shut at night. When people come back in the later hours, these heavy connecting doors must be opened, and then they swing to, heavily, and with a loud bang that woke me up several times each night.

A welcome packet would be nice; - Place a bellman to help their guests to bring up the luggage (4 star hotel must have this function) and set up a luggage deposit system (when a guest leaves his/her luggage, the hotel should give the numbered ticket to the guest as a receipt); - Air Conditioning is out-dated and make a loud noise. This should be included in the hotel's long-term capital investment plan to upgrade the system.

The upgrade was much appreciated especially as we had a good deal of 59 euros per night throught Booking.com (Trip Advisor (TA)and Solmelia websites are useful for offer prices). A very friendly young lady on reception offered us a twin room with balcony on the 7th floor facing Gran Via. She also offered us a deal on breakfast at 8 Euros each per day. The room was large with very big, comfortable twin beds. There is plenty of traffic noise but the double glazing was effective and we had undisturbed sleep. The aircon is not very effective and it may be quite hot in the height of summer. The ensuite was smallish but claen, modern and adequate. The hotel is spotless and comfortable and we found the staff to be very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was excellent and good value. The hotel is well located for a city break. The metro stn (plaza de espana) is about 40yds away, the Madrid Vision Bus tour stops 100yds away, there are very many restaurants of all kinds everywhere, and the city centre is a 10 min walk. Many of the must sees are within walking distance. We were there for 3 nights which was about right for us as we did not want to spend time in the many museums. We bought a 2 day ticket for Madrid Vision City Tour Bus for 10 euros each which let us do both red and blue routes to get our bearings and then get on and off to visit attractions. Tickets can be bought online, at the hotel or on the bus. Must see sites are: Stop 21 Egyptian Temple, Stop2 Royal Palace (long queues in the morning) and Cathedral , Stop4 Basilica de San Francisco El Grande (fabulus but closed from1-4pm), Stop6 Plaza Mayor, Stop 13 Retiro Park, and any of the museums that appeal. There are all kinds of eating places from \"all you can eat buffets\" at 9 euros each to very high class restaurants. We searched out a few recommendations from Trip Advisor and particularly liked La Gloria de Montera at about 20 euros and Cornucopia at about 24 euros a head for 2 courses with wine - both are within a 10 min walk from the hotel and can be found on the TA maps. We also enjoyed Cafe de Oriente, overlooking the Royal Palace, for a lunchtime beer and tapas. We had a great time and would recommend the hotel especially at the prices we found.

This hotel is centrally located on Gran Via, a very busy street. Our room was quite specious, which surprised me as I heard about rooms being small in size. Both room and the bathroom were very clean. Room has a wooden floor and I was again surprised to find it to be super clean!! The bed was comfy! There is a minibar, from which we used one soda one day and I believe the charge was 2 euro. We got the room which didn't face Gran Via and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever from the street or from other rooms. So we were very lucky about that. There was a balcony, but not an impressive view as it was off Gran Via, which was fine by us.. This room had a safe, which we used extensively. It had all the typical things that a hotel room has- hair dryer, glasses, cups. However, this room didn't have any coffee making facilities. We would have liked it but seriously I was so in love with Cafe con leche that I highly doubt I would have made any coffee in the hotel room and not drink Cafe con leche. And we were out most of the time anyway! So, it wasn't an issue for us. Our iron was missing in the room so my husband just made a ph call to reception and they sent it within 5 minutes. I have heard tons of things regarding the room temp problem mainly during Summer how the rooms were extremely hot and AC not working properly. When I booked this hotel, I got such a good rate that I didn't consider that as a problem and besides I thought by November it would be cold anyway, so, this issue of room being too hot would be moot. However, first two nights the room was quite cold, which meant something was really wrong with the heating system. My husband called the reception and they instructed him to adjust the temp so and so and it worked, but could have been better. While we were there they were having a promotion of breakfast 7 or 8 euro per person breakfast, but we didn't use that. There is a VIPS right across the hotel, where we had breakfast most of the time. And there are countless other restaurants within 5-10 minutes of walking distance to any direction from the hotel. Check in was easy- we got there really early around 8 in the morning. Reception told us that room is not ready and housekeeper would come at 9 and our room would be ready by 10. We went outside leaving the baggage with them, and by the time we came back at 11 it was ready. Check out was easy as well. I informed them night before to call a taxi for us and they did. Plaza de Espana metro is literally a block away from the hotel. Once you get out walk right and cross the street and metro station is there. There are 3 or 4 other metro stations within 5 minutes walking distance. As far as tourist attractions, on one direction from the hotel Plaza de Espana, Templo de Debod, Royal Palace are very close. So are Sol and Plaza Mayor on the other direction. If you stay at this hotel to visit these places you won't need to use the metro at all. I would definitely stay at this hotel again based on the cleanliness of the room/hotel, location and hassle free reception.

The first was Thurs-Sun, and I booked the Tryp Menfis. Although tempted to book it for the following weekend from Fri-Sun as well, I decided I would hold fire and see what the experience was like before re-booking for the following week, and I have to say I am very glad that I waited, as I had no intention of returning to the Tryp Menfis after my first experience. On arrival at the hotel, you are greeted with stairs to climb up to reception, with no ramp to wheel up your suitcases, so you have to carry them up yourself. The hotel has no bell boys or concierge service. Not a huge deal but something to be aware of if you have heavy bags with you that you cannot manage. Although I had booked a double-bedded room, the front desk allocated me a room with 2 single beds, so I was forced to return to reception to request that they move me to a double room as per my booking. It seems that most hotels in Spain always try to farm you off with a twin-bedded room in the first instance, and I recommend checking before you head up to the room. The guy on reception was helpful enough but said that I would have to have a smoking room at the back of the hotel if I wanted a double bed, even though I had booked a non-smoking double room. I was ok with being at the back of the hotel as it is quieter at night than facing onto the main Gran Via. The weekend I was there was one of the hottest they had experienced all summer with the temperature hitting 41C. The air conditioning in the room did not seem to work at all well, even before the temperature surge, and it was unbearably warm in the hotel room. There is no way to set the temperature on the thermostat - you can just choose, Low, Med and High - and none of these seemed any different from each other. I do not believe it was Air conditioning at all, just a very light fan that you could barely feel. After the first unpleasant night I called down to reception and advised that I didn't think that the AC was working. The receptionist made no attempt to send anyone to the room to investigate - and proceeded to respond by saying no one had complained about the AC before and suggested that perhaps it was me that had a problem. I knew this to be untrue as I had seen some reviews (after booking) on Trip advisor already complaining about the AC. I asked if housekeeping could provide me with a fan in the room, and he point blank refused and said that they didn't keep any fans on the premises. I asked what he would do if the AC really did break down, and he didn't have an answer. I have to say I expected a little better customer service than that - I was basicaly fobbed off and made to feel as though I was a naggy guest.... Apart from that the rooms are fairly decent, clean, bathrooms are very tiny. Location is great 2 mins walk from Metro and close walking distance to Gran Via shopping and the centre Sol. I walked most places - and was able to walk back in the early hours of the morning on my own with no issues. It was always reassuring to see police on every corner deterring trouble. As a woman on my own I felt incredibly safe throughout Madrid. Internet in the hotel is not free but I was lucky enough to pick up a free wireless network from my room, that said it depended on which part of the room I was in, but if I tried close to the wall which backs onto the sister hotel - the Tryp Washington, I was able to pick it up no problem. So would recommend trying that first before paying for internet in the hotel. In fact I found quite a few free wifi points throughout my trip in Madrid so its always worth checking. I used the mini bar which was fairly reasonable prices compared to most hotels. For my return to Madrid I booked the Senator Spa Espana which is 2 doors up from the Tryp Menfis, and was a much better overall experience, for a similar rate I got breakfast included, free wifi, free minibar which included soft drinks (although no alcohol) a much bigger room and bathroom, and very very helpful staff - a seperate review to follow on that hotel.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "HardCorToronto", "ReviewID": "UR33585473", "Content": "We loved the Tryp Menfis - everything about it, from the staff, to the terrific outside room balcony, location, breakfast, exercise room - really, everything.

There was a nice variety of breads, eggs, meats, cheeses, juices, yogurt, fruit and delicious coffee on the breakfast buffet. The scrambled eggs were cold both mornings and the sausage links were not good. But with the amount of choices available, it was hard to leave hungry. The main waiter who brought our coffee was very nice and friendly. The location is just a few steps from the Plaza de Espana and from the metro stop of the same name. It's also a couple of blocks from the Palace. The Metro in Madrid is great and easy to use. We'd definitely stay at the Tryp Menfis again. We ate one night at La Gloria de Montera Restaurante as recommended by Rick Steves. I highly recommend it.

Location at the end of Gran Via (closest Metro is either Plaza de Espana or Sol, depending on the line you're using) puts you near everything, but without the high room prices of other areas. A quick 10 minute walk puts you at the Puerta del Sol, Opera, Real Palace, or Plaza Mayor... all major attractions. I found that the Menfis had an excellent buffet, with something for all diets, as well as several excellent tapas-themed bars nearby, with some high-end restaurants as well. If you have to be American with your burger, there's a TGI Friday next door. Directly across the street is an excellent Tapas bar, Canas y Tapas, with some of the better tapas around the area. If you want pampering, this isn't the place, but if you want comfortable and safe surroundings, this is hard to beat. The only comparable hotels nearby might be the High Tech chain, whose properties tend to be off quieter streets than Gran Via. Bathrooms are indeed small for USA standards, but when traveling in Europe, just deal with it people! Do ask for a room off the Gran Via for slightly more quiet. This is Madrid, and people love their auto-horns at all hours. If you want quiet, definitely look elsewhere, but this hotel wins by a landslide on its location and comfort! Regarding Metro: Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem on the Metro to the airport, even with large luggage. It takes about 30 minutes, and costs 2 Euro each way, which is a bargain compared to a Taxi, which is more towards $30 each way, depending on passengers and luggage. The Madrid metro is exceedingly clean and modern, compared to anything in the USA, and is a safe and excellent option to get around this beautiful city.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wageningen, the netherlands", "Title": "\u201cclose to all interseting sights and good value for four stars and price\u201d", "Author": "sjordens", "ReviewID": "UR30940271", "Content": "The hotel is close to metrostation and city center.
