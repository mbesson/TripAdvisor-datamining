We had good sleeps in clean sheets; it was a bit chilly at nights, but we had extra blankets in the cupboard. All our rooms had a private bathroom. Ofcourse an old and cheap hotel isn't shiny and perfect, but we did't come to London to spend our time exploring dust and bucks in a hotel. Got up early for brekfast - fell in bed exhausted late at night. Corbigoe Hotell was perfect for us for our purposes! Felt safe in the area.

We said that we were happy with a double bed which we had booked and a call was then made by the receptionist and we were told that we had to stay \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdown the road\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We asked if the room was the same standard and that it was all Ok and we were advised that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcyes it was a very good room and we had to stay there because the Corbigoe was full\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (despite being offered a twin room and a vacancy sign showing on the door). We were taken to The Park Hotel on 64 Belgrave Road and were taken to a room 4 floors up (very steep stairs) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Room 14. This room was a very small room with a standard double bed. The room did not have any wardrobe or hooks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so in fact no-where to hang clothes, no cupboards, drawers or shelves so no-where to place anything. The bed was made up with a single sheet on the double bed so only half the bed was covered and the mattress was exposed. A thin blanket and a sheet lay on the bed. There was one towel, one mug (unwashed), one spoon, coffee, tea and no sugar in the room. We were unable to unpack or hang our clothes so spent the night getting ready stepping over our cases. The kettle would not fit under the tap so we could only fill it by scooping water from the dirty mug. The kettle then could only be plugged in on a plug half way up the wall and the kettle had to be held whilst being boiled. We went to Reception and asked to change room and was advised that nothing was available. We asked for the bed to be remade with a double sheet as we did not wish to lay on an exposed mattress, we were told there was nothing wrong with the bed and the sheets were changed only once per stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after a lot of arguing we finally got a sheet and made the bed ourselves. We asked for an extra towel and again was told we could not have one, the towels were only given out once per stay, we tried explaining it was not reasonable to expect us both to use the same towel and after much arguing finally we got an extra towel, the same went for the mug. The receptionist was extremely rude and unhelpful and made it very hard for us to get these extra items, we asked to speak to a manager but was advised one would not be available until Monday am. When we returned to the room a few minutes later the receptionist burst into the room without knocking and said; \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsorry sirs you are right the room is terrible, I will get you a refund, the fu~~ing cleaner did not do his job properly, tomorrow I will F~~k him F~~k him..... we were completely shocked by this outburst. The receptionist continually apologised agreeing the room was disgusting and said that tomorrow (Sunday) he would get us a better room and a refund for Saturday, he had also brought with him an open plate of sugar which contained dirty bits. We had an unpleasant nights sleep in what was a dirty cold room and showered in a disgusting mouldy shower. We could only sit on the toilet sideways as our legs would not fit in front of us. That night we returned to the hotel at separate times. My partner came in and went to bed taking the key from reception (we had to leave the key at the desk when going out). I returned at 4am and after knocking continually at the Reception window the receptionist got out his bed which was made on the reception floor and advised me I could not have a key to get in but I must wake up my partner to get in my room\u00e2\u20ac\u201c which I therefore did. The following morning we chose not to have breakfast at the hotel as we did not feel satisfied that the food hygiene would be up to standards as the room certainly as not. We spoke to the same receptionist in the morning and again he apologised and said we must speak with the manager on Monday morning (Mr S...?) and he would arrange a refund for us. In the meantime he had said that he had arranged for us to return to our original hotel to a larger room with a wardrobe so we could hang our clothes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all was to be in order and waiting for us. We walked back to the Corbigoe with our luggage and was told by the receptionist that we had to pay \u00c2\u00a315 extra for the room! By this time I was really annoyed and made it clear i would not be paying anymore. We were then taken to a room on the 3rd floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c room 13. This room was larger with a wardrobe and contained 3-beds. The room was still dirty and the beds made with just a single sheet on the mattress, it was again a disgusting room , however we could hang our clothes. The beds that night were extremely uncomfortable and the towel rail fell off the wall, the Tv only had 4 working channels. During our stay I noted that every fire door was propped open and I advised the receptionist that this was not correct as the fire doors should remain closed to prevent the spread of fire, the receptionist would not accept this and said they were left open to let people in/out. This therefore gave us grave concern as we were up on the 4th floor and our only means of escape in the event of a fire was down the one set of stairs where all the doors were constantly propped open! I also noticed that some fire extinguishers required a re-service this month. That night I returned to the hotel before my partner (who had the key on him) and asked the receptionist for a spare key, he told me \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and that i had to get the key from my partner. Not being happy I insisted he opened the door with a master key to let me in, finally he gave me a key but said I must return it immediately after unlocking my door, I said NO as I did not wish to walk up/down 4 flights of steep stairs, and reluctantly he followed me up to take back the key. Again we chose not to take breakfast at the hotel. I explained to the receptionist that i wished to have a written confirmation of my complaints which he refused to give. He said i must speak with the manager but the manager was away on holiday. I have photos which I can send you showing all the above mentioned faults should you wish. I am an operations Manager for a Warner hotel so I did realise that @\u00c2\u00a350 per night we would be not be getting large rooms or anything special in London \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we just wanted a clean place to sleep, shower and take breakfast;, however we did expect a clean room and bed, towels, blankets and sheets and to stay in the hotel we had booked and not get treated rudely. We did not get what we paid for and in fact one night did not even get to stay in the hotel we booked for. The whole experience ruined our weekend as we felt uncomfortable walking and washing in dirty rooms, stepping over our cases because we could not hang anything.

However this didn't linger, as staff sprayed room freshener after they had finished eating. We took our own towels, so can't comment on that. I made our beds everyday before leaving room. House keeping went into our room everyday to mop bathroom floor and give a quick hoover. The room always smelt fresh when we returned, bathroom bin was always emptied, daily.

Upon arriving at the Park Hotel London myself female (25) and my mother (50) were greeted with silence from the gent behind the counter, he placed his hand out and simply said 'confirmation form' and then 'how are you paying', we thought nothing of this other than he must have been having a bad day, however he was quick enough to demand payment!! He then said there was a problem with our room and that we would be moved \"half a minutes walk\" to their other hotel. We questioned why we could not move to another room to which he said simply - we couldnt we needed to be moved. We followed the gent to the complete other end of Belgrave Road, a good 7 or 8 minutes walk from where we orginally booked! Once there at the Corbigoe Hotel, we were once again greeted with silence! We were then shown to our room, three doors down from the reception area, we opened the door and i had to stand outside the room while the gent showed my mum inside as it wasnt big enough for 3 of us!! We had paid for a private bathroom and toilet. We asked where this was to which he said your bathrooms here - to our amazment the private bathroom was a cupboard with a shower head. We asked again where our toilet was to which he said it is 2 doors down next to the reception!! We complained that we had paid extra for private toilet, to which his reply was \"well only you will be using this\"! We then asked the gent where we should go for breakfast as we had paid for this to which he said you have not paid for breakfast at this hotel, we once again complained perfusly that we had not only had to move hotel but now we had to argue for something we had already paid for, i asked the man to get my confirmation form out which stated this and he refused to do so, i then said i have it here on my phone in email format stating clearly we have paid for breakfast, he response to this was \"well we will see in the morning\"! We were then woke up at 7.45am by builders in the next room, drilling, sawing and banging! We got up at this point totally disgusted and left at 8.30! To say the least this experience completely ruined our trip, (which was to celebrate my mums 50th by seeing a show and shopping). The attitude of both staff from each hotel was something i have never experienced before and wouldnt wish anyone to experience this again. The room was dirty, the heating not working, the television above the bed looked totally unsafe, the one cup for tea was cracked and broken. I feel extremely saddend that a company like this can still trade, i feel the authorities should be informed and i will be taking this matter further.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tartu, Estonia", "Title": "\u201cWhat a horrible place!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "friedchicken030", "ReviewID": "UR81909885", "Content": "Me and my friend were looking for a nice and cheap place to stay while visiting London.

As we got to this place, we were taken downstairs to a very nasty room, which door actually had a sign saying Fire exit on it. It had one big bed, on top of it was an ugly looking towel and a used soap. It was just horrible. It didnt take us long to decide that we were so not going to stay there! So we went back upstairs where we were told to pay for a one night stay:S:S so we just did it in order to get away from there as soon as possible!!! So there we were alone in the big city without any accommodation. Luckily we had looked up another place to stay at and they had a mixed dorm which was compared to Corbigoe really nice. Sooo I can only advise you to stay away from this hotel. Before actually booking, we looked at this site and read the negative comments but we coulndt believe it would be actually so bad.

We wanted to file a complaint and the front desk clerk told us to go back to the other hotel because we were registered there and it was not his concern. We said we were not going back to that hotel being we were informed that they were both the same establishment, even though at this point we know that this was not the truth. We requested that the man get our luggage and he nastily told us that he was a 2 star hotel, a bed and breakfast and had a job to do and was not going to get our luggage. We were not going to stay at a hotel that we did not make reservations at. The man finally sent one of the staff up to our room to retrieve our luggage. We were forced to walk around London until we found a much higher priced hotel where we could stay.

We did not complain about air conditioning because we were never even taken to a room in the hotel we booked. Our travel agent called back because we asked for the name of the man at the desk when we checked in and our supposed room number. Suddenly the manager had left and the supervisor was out of town.

However when we were given the rooms (on the top floor - no lift, 10 flights of stairs) we were disgusted at what we saw. The rooms had not been made up and were filthy. The beds were dirty, the bins were over flowing with food. The bathroom - well don't ask. I immediately went downstairs and requested a refund (we had to pay as soon as we entered the building). The guy said he understood why we did not want to stay there but wanted to take us to a better hotel, with bigger rooms and a nicer shower. Foolishly we agreed and were taken to The Corbigoe. From the outside, these hotels look beautiful - however the inside leaves a lot to be desired. I think that because of the original memory of The Park, we conceded that the rooms at The Corbigoe were better - however the truth is, they were not! I have uploaded photos of the bathroom because I believe people should see what they could encounter if they chose to stay there. We were given two rooms - a twin room and a room big enough for three of us. My room was not ready when we were taken there but was assured that it would be cleaned before I came back after sight seeing.I wouldn't put my worst enemy in this room. The beds were uncomfortable with very dirty sheets. Not sure if we imagined it, but we itched all night long. The window was broken so would not close, making it cold and noisy in our room. The person next door to us, clearly could not use a key and decided to kick his bedroom door open at night. This terrified us (I was with two children). At any time of day, we could make our way down the several flights of stairs and find dirty bed linen on the floor - still there several hours later. A vacuum was also left in the landing, possibly for show as I refuse to accept that it is ever used!The bathroom was so filthy we were considering not washing during our stay. The mould and pure filth was extensive in the bathroom. I can barely believe we came out alive! There was no hot water for the shower after early morning and we used bottled water to brush our teeth due to the dirt on the sink taps. The toilet was deeply stained with a brown substance - that was just lazy cleaning staff - no excuse for such awful standards. We did not pull the shower curtain around us, for fear it might touch us - yuk!! The bathroom smelled and this obviously drafted into our sleeping area. The handles on the wardrobe and cupboard were broken and there was such dust inside that you would never hang your clothes up anyway. The breakfast described as continental was just toast and jam. But to be fair, had they served up anything more, it would go uneaten as you can just imagine the environment where it may be cooked. The reception is advertised as 24 hour, however this appears to be shared between the two hotels. We came back from a trip to the theatre at midnight and could not get in. Eventually a man came carrying keys to let us in, but it took him a further 15 minutes to locate the right key and get us into the hell hole. I am not passive in any way and complained repeatedly to the manager, however this fell on deaf ears. We found the staff to be rude and ignorant and unhelpful. I am aware that it is a budget hotel and as such did not expect plush surroundings, but a basic standard of hygiene should always been maintained and here it was not. It would be better and cleaner to sleep in the tube station.

I planned a trip to London for New Year's and while looking for a budget hotel I came across the Corbigoe website. Happy to see that there was a website and that there was an online booking discount offer, I called the hotel to ask a few questions, got them answered in a relatively professional manner, and went ahead to make my reservation online. I arrived in London and took the tube to the station Corbigoe recommended on their website. Big mistake. If after reading all these reviews you still plan to book with them, take the underground to Pimlico (2 blocks away), NOT to Victoria. After a long and convoluted walk I found the hotel. I was hoping to get in the room, shower, and sleep for a few hours. My friend who was staying with me was arriving later that day. At the receptionI was told that the room wasn't ready for another 3 hours...The guy at the reception told me however that I had to pay for everything now. Not being used to paying upfront, and not having enough cash, I was dismayed but gave him my credit card. He told me that there is a three-pound surcharge for using a card, and as I realized later, an awful exchange rate. He told me I could leave my suitcase in the room and come back in a few hours. I walked into the room and was overcome by disappointment, fear, and a desire to run away! The room was tiny, untidy and dirty. I thought that they probably hadn't cleaned it yet since the previous customers checked out. I left the hotel, and returned after about 2 hours, which I thought was ample time for them to get it cleaned, since they knew I had arrived already. When I came back the room was still unavailable, but the man rushed the maid to wrap up the cleaning so that I could use the room. As a result they forgot to leave any toilet paper or soap. I took a nap and thought that after I wake up everything will seem better. After I woke up, things were even worse. There was serious mold on the walls. The carpet was still dirty (I found jelly beans on the floor). The drawers were dirty and sticky. There was a thick layer of dust on the closet. The bathroom ceiling leaked every time someone upstairs showered. One of the wall lamps had no bulb and was broken. Given that there are no phones in the rooms, I wasn't sure how they would let me know that my friend had arrived. But he had no difficulty finding the room. Apparently, he gave the receptionist my name and they told him the room # and let him in without asking any other questions (not even his name) and without letting me know that someone was here to see me. During the 6 days we stayed the room was never cleaned, the (two) towels never changed, and the bed was made once. When I checked out there were two men in the reception. I returned the key and told them I'm checking out. They said \"OK\". I also gave them 3 umbrellas that I had to buy for the rain, and told them that they could give them out to other customers when they need them (I needed one the first night, and was told that they didn't have any). They took them and remained silent. I stood there for a minute or so, waiting for the courtesy \"thank you for staying with us\" or \"we hope you enjoyed your stay\", but all I got were looks of \"ok, you're done\". At that moment all I could do was smile and be happy that I was out of there. Had I not paid in advance, and were it not a busy time of the year, I would have left from day 1.

On arrival we were told that the room they had reserved for us was not available as there was a 'problem', so they would be taking us to a nearby partner hotel - the Chester Hotel. 'Taking us' actually meant that we had to walk quite some distance down the street with a member of the reception staff, who didn't offer any assistance, even though we had quite a few bags between us. We were then met by a member of staff from the other hotel. Had I not already paid for the room through hotels.com, I would have walked away as soon as I saw it. However, I did not see there being much chance of me getting my money back so we decided to brave the room for the night. The room was very small and was probably even too dirty for cockroaches to stay there. The fridge in the room did not work, the cups for us to drink tea from were covered in a healthy layer of dirt, which was actually not such an issue given that there was no tea, milk or sugar provided in the room (I eventually discovered that this was to be found in a tray outside of reception in the basement, not that I would ever have taken the risk of consuming anything from those cups) and various wires covered the floor in front of the bathroom door as the TV was some distance from the aerial socket, meaning a trip or fall was a possible occurence. Two double beds (but only 1 towel in total!) were provided in the room for our use. This was fortunate as it allowed my girlfriend and I to choose the option with the least unidentified hairs on the pillow/under the duvet.

After checking in and mentioning that we'd booked two en-suite rooms, we got a double room each, no extra charge, how generous we thought!! ! we mentioned that we had booked 2 ensuite singles, and instead of an explanation or apology, we got a dirty look!! the tv in my room did not have a single channel that worked, the draws and wardarobe were unfit for use and had a funny musty smell, so badly that i had to wash my unworn clothes when i got home!! no ensuite facalities in the room except for a wash basin, bedsheets that smelt horrible and were stained, bed that looked threadbare, the carpet may as well not had been there! i looked forward to having in room tea and coffee facilitys, but after inspecting the cups, i wouldn't let a dying person drink out of one! the paint work needed redoing badly, carpets that looked like they hadn't been hoovered ever! scratches all over the bedside draws! the towels provided in room, was so disgusting i wouldn't dry my dog with one!! as for the rest of the hotel, all carpets were threadbare, the toilet smelt horrible, was tiny, and the door lock was about as much use as a chocolate fireguard! i tried to avoid using the toilet as much as possible, the subway toilets in westminster were like royalty-type compaired to this! the shower was so small, so dark,so dirty, i went without a shower for 3 days, i thought to myself, which would i rather do, smell or catch a disease!! the staff were inconsiderate, i had the misfortune of being in the room nearest to reception and had the pleasure of them shouting at the top of there voices at 5 in the morning! and no i didn't request a wake up call!! i looked forward to a nice breakfast and cup of tea! the tea tasted like it had been drained out the nearest sewer, the breakfast was cornflakes or toast, the cornflakes tasted like they were quite literally \"so last year\" one morning my dad and i sent the toast back!! we felt fortunate to be given jam to go with it! i am a lover of orange juice, there juice didn't taste of orange! so after all that we had to pay out for food on outings! the breakfast room was cold, un appealing, cramped, basic, and not to mention so uncomfortable that i would have been happier to sit on a park bench! if you want accomodation that is at least clean and provides a cup of tea, i wouldn't so much recommend this hotel for that!", "Date": "July 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cCorbigoe Hotel then...\u201d", "Author": "KiwiTrekker", "ReviewID": "UR5019758", "Content": "I booked into this hotel primarily because this was the cheapest I could find in London and our New Zealand dollar (at that time) would only fetch 33 English pence. My wife and I are not fussy people when it comes to accommodation and with some foresight had an idea of what we may be getting ourselves into. We booked and stayed for 5 nights and although breakfast was included we did not eat there but preferred to make sandwiches in our room. Some issues about Corbigoe are listed below: 1. Expect to be asked to pay your full accommodation costs at book in time. 2. Staff are OK but not overly helpful 3. No lift, If you are on the top floor you will need to negotiate some pretty tough stairways ( alright for those who like the exercise). 4. Change of towels and bed linen are irregular. 5 TV set will get 2 or 3 watchable channels 6. Double room was adequate but ensuite toilet and shower required attention (mildew etc). On the plus side: Centrally located, close proximity to Pimlico station and local laundromat, Victoria Station about 1km away. (If you are concerned about the cost of \"eating out\" in Westminster City you can catch a local bus just outside, which will take you all the way to Campbell Town for cheap eating). Overall: As one reviewer pointed out, \"You pay for what you get\" My reason for flying half way around the world was to see London's sights and scenes on a budget. I used Corbigoe Hotel for the purpose of having a cheap place to rest my head each night. Although, I was far from enthused about Corbigoes service, it primarily suited my needs. Would I stay there again? Maybe, if Corbigoe can rectify its faults and upgrade its service (if not already) I cannot see why not.", "Date": "April 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCheap means cheap\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4721068", "Content": "You definetly pay for what u get, when we arrived we were greeted by a tiny room, the room itself was clean and tidy, so was the bathroom apart from the shower which looked to have not been cleaned in weeks, we were disappointed with the breakfast which was small,(and the breakfast room was so cold you needed to wear a coat), definetlely not good enough for a days wlking around in London, for breakfast there was only cornflakes, tea, coffee(which was cold), and toast which you had to make yourself bearing in mind there were only 2 toasters for everyone, you even had to make your own tea, not the best organised in the world then when we were leaving we wanted to leave our luggage for the day and they charged us 1 pound per bag, I wont be staying there again.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cTurned Out Great !!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4692248", "Content": "After Reading all the scary reviews on this place(After being booked of course) We were freaked to say Just a Little.

I am a United States Marine currently vacationing with a friend from back home in Europe and I had thought from prior experiences in Iraq I had seen the worst. NEVER did I EVER expect to find a place of business let alone a Hotel in downtown London in such Heinous condition. If you continue on you may find humor or you may find disgust but this is the absolute truth about 2 gentlemen and how we paid to sleep under conditions you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find in the worst Compton Crack house. Honestly people it was so nasty it was funny, at least to a bunch of 22 year old travelers, families beware. We had just finished up a wonderful 5 days in Barcelona, full of fun in the sun, great food and awesome people en route to London where neither my friend nor myself had ever been. After squelching by on remedial Spanish we both looked forward to being able to utilize our English again, myself more than my friend as I have been living abroad in Geneva for over one year already without returning home to the states. We arrived in the late afternoon to 101 Belgrave road via Taxi from Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s station which is fairly close by. The Carbigoe hotel was chosen in advance off of Expedia primarily because of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location and due to it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasonable price we had low expectations from the get go. As we entered our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153palace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the first thing my friend and I realized was that this was not the same hotel we had seen pictured on their website, we wondered. Next we noticed a dingy smell of crud permeating through our nostrils complimented by the overbearing noise of an ensemble of hammer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drills and screaming Arabian men. An Arab man wearing a polkadot butterfly collar shirt with goldrope necklace came around from the corner countertop and greeted us with a sly smile whilst we pulled out our Expedia confirmation. Preeminent dread filled my thoughts as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gentleman\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the front desk proceeded to tell us we had to pay him and that our expedia reservation was just a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reservation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which required a fee in which he claimed he received nothing. Hmmm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Pretty pricey for a minimal service arrangement such as hotel accommodations. Of course being the streetwise cat that I am I immedietly countered with a look of extreme anger and mistrust and demanded to see where it say\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that I had to pay twice. Having the paperwork on me of course worked to my benefit as he could produce nothing. After the two minutes of haggling it was time for my pal and I to see our room. We were given the key to room # 14 a few stories up, I grabbed my luggage and headed 2 feet from the desk towards the only direction other than the exit which was a narrow decrepit carpeted monstrosity someone could also describe as a staircase. I went on to lug my hefty baggage upstairs when I almost tripped over the ridiculous amount of garbage strewn across the first landing, I wobbled and regained my composure then proceeded up the next flight of stairs. We finally reach our destination. Room #14 we open the door and find ourselves in a room as follows, Four disgusting soiled walls with random holes and hand prints everywhere. Three mattresses pushed together to form what I guess was supposed to be their equivalent of a kingsize bed (hence the knickname we gave the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Royal Carbigoe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) linen strewn with I kid you not, pubic hairs. Notheless It reminded me of something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see in the home of abusive foster parents. The carpet was stained and reeked of urine, was also torn in most area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The sink jutting out of the wall was rusted and when we turned the knobs we were shocked to find brown water spurting out from the faucet. For entertainment my friend and I were shocked to see a non-functioning 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s era television set that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure not even the salvation army would have excepted as a goodwill donation from a dying 80 year old man. The furniture could hardly be called even that. Our dressor unit looked as though it had been manufactured by a three year old, it was crooked and had rusted nails sticking out of every nook and cranny, even the d\u00c3\u00a9cor on my Marine Corps issue wall locker was nicer. Overall this place was a dump. But as heinous and awe inspiring this room was we could not overlook the one comforting amenity the management was so kind to include, and that was two stained and dirty coffee mugs with two wet instant coffee packet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, even a complimentary half used roll of toilet paper. thanks guys. Well, were only here for two days we both thought since we are only using this as a place to crash out at night what the hell. Hmmm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Why then am I writing this paper? Please continue reading. We were both getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cleaned up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before getting ready to go out for a night out on the town, although I must admit it felt a bit more like getting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dirtied up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in this joint. My friend came dashing up the stairs, I could tell 10 seconds before he entered because of the increased creaking coming from the floorboards beneath his feet. He came in wet with a beach towel wrapped around his waist (they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even supply us with a towel) on his face was the look of disgust. He said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deniz man the shower is clogged..\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I ran down to investigate and opened the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153community shower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was at best a 4ftX4ft closet that had been tiled inside and converted into a shower by someone simply jamming a pipe through a hole in the wall and then chiseling a hole in the side of the floor which was clogged up due to cigarette butts jammed up inside its crevice. I wanted to puke at the site of dirty water overflowing into the hallway and onto the already moldy dirty carpet. Nonetheless after a half hour of drainage I was able to take a 30 second shower myself by quickly wetting my body down then to subdue the imminent flooding that was about to occur, quickly shutting off the water and soaping up (with my own soap of course, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide us with any. Although their was a dirty brown piece of soap floating on the shower floor..) then I rinsed off very quickly (the shower still overflowed). My buddy and I quickly got dressed and locked the door behind us running from this disaster.. we were quickly slowed by the Arab man who ran the front desk stepping into our way and propositioning us to bring him back some lady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when we returned later that night. Although I cannot speak directly for the opposite sex, I will go as far as to call this man the sketchiest person alive. We ran down to Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s station and after this episode we were determined to hit up a bar in order to drown out the awful feelings this brief encounter with the carbigoe hotel had induced. We returned sometime in the wee twilight of morning, I wont go into detail of our exact condition but it was good enough so that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really mind lying down in our disgusting room and passing out. We were both in a deep comatose slumber when at sometime between 7 AM and 8 AM we were awoken by a banging and kicking at our door. Could this be real? Was I dreaming? I quickly came to and my friend from the other side of the room (yes we moved the beds) babbled in a half sleepy tone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what the hell is going on..??\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I got up went over to the door and asked who it was. In a thickly accented language one might call English our Arabian friend who we can also now refer to as Mr. Sketchball was demanding we open up and let him in. Well since I am only a guest in his Royal Palace of Carbigoe I was obliged to do so. He came in, this time wearing a brown leisure suite but with still the butterfly collar and gold rope knecklace adorning his hairy chest. Sketchy sat down on the edge of my friends bed. He spoke of things, many things but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until he pulled out a set of keys from his leisure suit pocket did we actually comprendo what was going on. He said in a raspy voice whilst exhibiting the sly smile we had both come to know and love \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you go upstair, new room, today we have construction demolition this room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hmm.. could this be true, was our friend Senor Sketchball really demanding we leave this room so he could destroy it. What luck!!! So we gladly agreed to Sketchball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands and told him within one hour we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be ready to relocate, he gave us a grin and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yess you lucky, today you move up in Carbigoe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What could we say after that? Although I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall what room number we were now moving into, it was located directly above our current lodging and as we made our way through yet another set of wobbly stairs and through the mountain pass of garbage left on the landing and up over a stream of toilet paper stuck to the floor in front of our new accommodations we breathed a sigh of relief\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. One more night here and were GONE. Amen. We opened the door and found a room almost identical to the one from the night before, except for one improvement. This time there were no holes in the wall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. I felt flushed, I felt angered at the thought that our good friend Mr. Sketch hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accommodated us this well the first night. I know this room was vacant because for nothing less than novelty my friend and I had toured the hotel top to bottom the day before taking pictures and documenting the other oddities we found hilarious. Makes you wonder. Anyways this time we left our luggage and locked the door, setting out for our last day in London. We got done sightseeing around 9 PM and headed back to the Carbigoe, thank goodness, only a few more hours left and we were out of here. We had to wake early in the morning, approximately 1:30 AM so we asked Mr. Sketch if he could give us a wakeup call, he agreed but I asked him how he would go about this since we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any phone in our room, he smiled \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Chills ran down my spine as I became even more creeped out than ever before as he grinned. I then asked again \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so, sir\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 how do you plan on waking us up?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he pushed some yellowed, cracked button on the wall and I heard a slow whiney buzzer go off, ingenious! He has a system, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see if it works. I turned to Mr. Sketch one last time with hope in my eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and asked him also if he could call a cab for us to be ready and out front at 1:45 AM. He looked back and grinned muttering something that sounded like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This I believe is common practice at most hotel establishments around the world. I suggested we pack up early so we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about it at 1 AM\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 My friend agreed so we did just that. I looked on the floor and saw a dirty black sock, thinking it belonged to my friend I almost went to pick it up when my friend informed me it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t his. I had noticed this sock since earlier in the day but I just assumed that it was his. I guess I was wrong. But someone tell me this, WHY IN THE WORLD was there someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dirty used sock on the floor of my hotel room, I paid to stay in this hotel room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 WHY! Before we hit the hay my friend suggested we walk back downstairs to check out our room from the first night. We did so and were shocked to see a sheet tacked to where there was once a doorway, we peered through even further and to our astonishment found a demolished room, Sketch wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kidding when he told us a demo crew was coming up there that day, I mean I took pictures this room was completely destroyed, I smiled at this thought and said to myself this was perhaps a good thing. Luckily my cellphone alarm went off at 1:30 I never heard the buzzer. My friend and I got up, I was ready first so I told my friend I would go downstairs and find out if our friendly front desk attendant had called our cab since he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t woken us as he promised. As I sped down the spiral of doom known also by the name staircase, I heard the buzzer go off. Slick guy you are Mr. Sketch, Very very slick. This guy was so on the ball that when he heard me coming from all the way down on the 1st floor he felt compelled to push his stinkin button, that way I could never say he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done for me what little he could. Thanks. So I make it downstairs and I see Mr. Sketch, not smiling, not frowning but rather dismayed and in panic. He had not called the cab. Our bus was leaving Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at 2:15 AM, it was approaching 2. Thanks again Sketch. So I kindly and patiently asked him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sir, could you please call us a taxi? It is urgent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He assured me that he would and picked up his cell phone and smiled, slyly\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 he hung up after a few words and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ok I call, you pay me now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I looked at him and assured him that when the taxi came I would pay them myself, and that I appreciated his kind goodwill gesture of trying to take that burden upon himself. He fumed back \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No you pay me now for call Taxi, service me pay cell phone bill!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I laughed, could this be for real, this fellow who had made our stay a virtual nightmare, whom I showed more compassion and leniency than most without so much as a single complaint, could he really be mad at this simple and favorable request. Even after all the money I had paid to stay in this dump, which I might add is a considerable amount for what could be considered a negative five star establishment, Mr. Sketch still wanted more. That was it, it was time to release. I looked at Sketch, I stared him right in the eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and saw nothing, no feeling, no conscience, no remorse for his selfish and devious way\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and I let loose a verbal assault with such eloquence and tact that he could say no more. He stood there silently staring at his pathetic wall as my friend came down and joined me in the akward silence that seemed to last forever, although in actuality it was only momentary. A car pulled up, not a taxi but rather another middle eastern gentleman in his own private vehicle and Sketch motioned us that our cab had arrived. This was what we call where im from in Boston, a Gyspy Cab which I believe is quite an illegal practice. Sketch and the driver spoke and embraced, perhaps our taxi driver was a relative or fellow crook, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care at this point we had a plane to catch. So we climbed into this so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taxi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to knowingly get overcharged and headed out to nearby Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s station never to return to that stink hole called Carbigoe again. NEVER. Overall London was great, but I attribute none of this to our hotel at all. If anything this hotel was the only blemish on our entire trip which took us to many other destinations over a 2 week period. For those wondering why I would take my time and write such a piece let me say this. If it is not already evident I am not a writer, this was not for profit and this was not to defame the establishment mentioned, at least not for personal gain. I was so compelled after staying in this establishment and so dismayed that there appears to be no regulations or sanctions to prevent this place from operating and advertising falsely I might add on reputable websites such as expedia or hotels. Lastly I will simply state that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my WORST enemy confined to this rathole. The management is horrendous and this is a building that ought to be condemned. Like I stated earlier I have clearly slept in rougher places, but certainly not by choice and certainly not for any kind of fee. So Carbigoe, I surely join many, many other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in saying your hotel is the MOST heinous and disgusting hotel I hope to ever, ever see. For people reading this please take my word and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t subject yourself to this type of masochist abuse by staying here.", "Date": "June 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey, Channel Islands", "Title": "\u201cA little Gem\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3271464", "Content": "Having paid such a nominal amount for what we thought was a 'Budget Hotel' in London, imagine our surprise as the concierge opened the front door, we were greeted by a large marble floored reception with a beautiful chandelier hanging above the centre piece fountain.

Beautifully furnished with a Moroccan theme, the view from the room over the rooftops with the London Eye glistening in the distance was simply breathtaking.

Unfortunately i am unable to use a similar word beginning with the letters 'sh' to fully describe how awful this hotel really was.", "Date": "March 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe Pits - Vile!\u201d", "Author": "Coolwaters", "ReviewID": "UR3263696", "Content": "I wish there was a minus scale rating on Tripadvisor as this hotel does not warrant even 1 out of 5. It is vile and I was bitten by bedbugs!!!!! Disgusting, dirty and most certainly unprofessional. I would't even consider it to have Youth Hostel standards - honestly! I wish I had read the reviews below before booking.....do any official tourst boards act on the information stated by guests on advisory sites such as this? If so, the reviwes give plenty of reason for the place to be condemned, closed down and...if possible, bulldozed!
