When we arrived Sunday afternoon for our two night stay, it appeared the part of town it is in -- a business park area -- had \"rolled up the sidewalks.\" However that was just fine for my wife and me; we have reached a point in our lives that we want to be away from the \"excitement\" when we turn in for the night while traveling. Even though a bit \"removed from the action,\" it was not too difficult to get to our desired destination -- Seaworld -- by driving. However I did get turned around and was going the wrong way on International Drive before figuring it out. So it might help to have a map of the area or to turn on your GPS (I didn't becuase I thought I knew where I was going -- ha!) Speaking of GPS, we drove in on the FL turnpike, and the exit we were directed to take is a Sunpass prepaid only toll site (no cash accepted). Forturnately I saw this on the sign before getting off, and I just went on down the road a bit and was able to get turned around and, evenutally, to the hotel. This is certainly not the hotel's fault, but they might need to mention it in the driving directions on their website. This hotel definitely met Hampton's standards, and overall we were highly satisfied and would definitely stay here again when we visit Orlando.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWe've Found A New Place To Stay In Orlando!\u201d", "Author": "sounddude", "ReviewID": "UR128282854", "Content": "My wife and I needed a room near the Orlando Convention Center for a couple of nights while we were to attend an Andrew Wommack conference at the Hilton. We had previously stayed at another hotel nearby but I was having trouble finding the listing for that property so with the help of The Negotiator, I started a new search. This Hampton Inn popped up for under $90 through one of Trip Advisor's partners so I reserved a room here as the ratings of this four year old property were 9+ out of 10. We checked in late and were quickly taken care of by the night manager herself and in no time, we had two hot cookies and were on our way to our room. I can't express enough how nice it is after a long day to find a spacious, super clean room waiting. If you've ever stayed in a Hampton, you know what the rooms are like: large and handsomely appointed. Again, this property is only 4 years old but a room can get wrecked in less time. Apparently, the management of this hotel takes constant steps to keep the place in top shape. The walls were unscathed, the beds were large queens, firm but not hard with pillow top mattresses, the cable television had lots of crystal clear channels to watch, WiFi was strong and fast. This room had a large mini-fridge that did not have a freezer section and also came with a microwave and coffee maker. The bathroom was spacious, looked brand new, comfortable and had a separate door from the rest of the room. Our room, 314, was directly backed by the elevators but we did not hear any noise at all from those units. Another nice touch was the ice maker and drink machine, which are normally next to the elevators, are actually in a closed room with a glass door. This prevents the sound of the coolers from disturbing the guests in the adjacent rooms as well as the sound of people filling their buckets with ice. We thought this was a real clever idea and kudos to Hampton Inns for coming up with this feature. The breakfast area is large with the typical annoying large screen TV at one end. These should never have the sound up as it causes all the patrons eating to speak loudly to be heard over the TV. We would suggest that management mute the sound and turn the closed captioning on. This would provide a more pleasant breakfast experience. The offering for breakfast at a Hampton is usually pretty good. Our first morning was great. Fresh fruit greets hungry travelers. The hot entrees were reconstituted scrambled eggs and sausage patties. The eggs were okay but the sausage was great. They also have the make-you-own Belgian waffles and cold cereal. Add to that all the normal bagels, muffins, apples (individually wrapped), etc., and you'll get plenty to fill you up. Also noted is that they had four different types of juice and three different types of coffee to drink. The second day the hot offerings were a cheese covered bagel and a cheese omelet. This was not the best idea as many people like myself do not or can not eat cheese so having the two hot foods both with cheese is not good planning. So I made myself a waffle. Where not terrible, it tasted like and had the consistency of pancake batter, which is much cheaper than good quality waffle mix so this could be improved but is a nit-pick. The second day fresh fruit offering was not as good as the first and we would recommend a greater variety in the mix. Still good but could be better. A nice feature of Hamptons is the free lunch bag they provide (until the daily supply runs out) at the front desk. These consist of various things like health bars, apples, bananas, a bottle of water, etc. A nice touch and we took ours to have for our break-time snack during the conference. The manager told us that this property was built as a business hotel as it's off the beaten path and right in the middle of a commercial complex, so it may be under the radar for many folks going to the theme parks or attending events at the Convention Center, which is only two miles away. We would highly recommend the Hampton Inn & Suites Orlando John Young Parkway for any travel to the Orlando area!", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smith's, Bermuda", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and large comfortable room\u201d", "Author": "buccij", "ReviewID": "UR128086141", "Content": "Stayed for one night before driving to Port Canaveral (about one hour drive) to embark on a cruise.

I had booked online through the Hampton Inn website and the only rooms available were those with 1 King bed. I went ahead and booked b/c the reviews for this hotel were very good and we needed to be in this area as it was located right off the turnpike. When I booked, I did specify I was a Hilton Honors member and wanted to request a two double bed room (they ask you if the room you wanted was available when booking, and if you answer no, then they ask your room preference). We arrived very early at this hotel (around 12:20pm) and were told the hotel was completely full, so they couldn't accommodate our request for two beds. They told us the room should be ready around 3pm (which is check-in time). We were directed to a mall area that had a lot of shopping and restaurants nearby. When we returned from lunch and shopping our room was indeed ready. They didn't say anything about the room itself, so I had just accepted that we were going to get the room we reserved. Imagine our surprise when it was indeed the two double beds! After about 45mins of being in the room, I received a call from the manager just to make sure the accommodations were okay (which they were). The beds were comfortable, the bathroom had been newly remodeled and it had all of the little toiletries one expects (shampoo, face soap, body soap, lotion). There was a refrigerator in the room with a small freezer so we were able to refreeze the cold packs we had in our portable lunch bag so our drinks could stay cool for the remainder of our road trip. While this hotel is in a business park (behind a business park actually), it is very quiet and seemed very safe. It's only a couple of turns/roads away from Orange Blossom (trail I believe it's called) and that is where the Florida Mall is (we didn't go in) and lots of chain type restaurants (Chili's, Red Lobster, etc.) and familiar shops. The hotel also had a pool and the breakfast the next day was decent (it's complimentary, so no complaints:-)) You could make your own Belgian waffle (the mix was pre-prepared; the iron beeped loudly when it was done.

It was very close to the malls and right across the street from a Walmart! The front staff was helpful and welcomed us with some Thanksgiving treats :) We only had a bad experience when leaving. We got the bill and saw they charged us for \"long distance\" calls. When we called the front desk to query and said we called only \"407\" LOCAL numbers (which are free), they said because I put a \"1\" in front of it, they consider it long distance so my billed showed over $44 in calls!! We were outraged and Maria at the front counter was adamant on the fact she could not help us, and could not fix anything until the manager comes back 3 days later! She could see the numbers that was dialed were local but said if we want we can \"email a complaint\". We couldn't believe it, she could see it was local, and she wouldn't pass on our message or offer to call an manager, but said we should \"send an email\"! She said it doesn't matter cuz \"we've already been billed\"..... So we definitely left on a bad note there. The manager however did call us 3 days later and left a voicemail advising all charges were removed and he apologized. But someone needs to do something about that! Apart from that, the room (416) was very spacious, clean and up to date, flat screens included! Make sure to go down to breakfast early as they start to clean up and remove stuff 10am sharp! Where as the Hampton Inn in Coral Gables were more accommodating especially to those who had families to allow them to eat and enjoy themselves without rushing!

This hotel is mainly visited by business travelers; weekends usually families will stay there. It's not in the middle of the parks and a car will be necessary to travel around. For us that is a plus; we like a more quiet place instead of families taking over a place. Staff is very helpful and friendly.

We are Hilton Honors members and that gives us better rates in the Hilton family of hotels. We arrived late in Orlando ( almost midnight) and were very hungry. We stopped at a nearby 7 Eleven and we were very scared, I must say. There was a group of youngsters drinking and smoking right outside ( which is a gas station!!! ) and they had a very unfriendly look on their faces. Bear in mind if you book this hotel that you will definitely need a car, there is nothing within walking distance, and this 7 Eleven, though quite a walk from the hotel, feels very unsafe. The hotel itself is very nice, the room is very spacious and has a microfridge and a coffee maker. They serve a very decent breakfast ( both hot and cold items) . As we arrived very late at night we requested a late check out and the front desk promptly granted our request at no extra charge. Parking is free but there is a huge sign stating hotel cannot be held responsible for personal items left inside the car. That sign added on to our feeling that the neighborhood wasn't a safe one. One good aspect though, is that all rooms are inside the building, and you need a key to acess the inside. Our room was very clean and we have no complaints at all. I'd say that, if Disneyworld is your destination and you plan to spend most of your time at Disney, this hotel is a long drive from their parks. It is closer to Universal and Sea World, but not really near. If distance and time are not an issue, and you won't be out later at night, I'd recommend this Hampton Inn.

For the past 5 years, I have traveled throughout the southeastern states and have stayed at a variety of Hampton Inns and this Orlando Hampton is by far the best one!! This Hampton is the best for a number of reasons. First is the cleanliness. Cleanliness is always the utmost priority for me (and I am very particular in this category!). During each and every stay at this Hampton property, I\u2019ve found the rooms to be exceptionally clean and up to my very high standards. The housekeeping staff works extremely hard and does a super job of keeping the rooms and common areas of the hotel clean and fresh. Another reason why this Hampton property is the best is for the high-level of customer service the staff provides to their guests. Since I am in sales, I am cognizant to the quality of customer service that I receive. In my opinion, excellent customer service always starts at the top with the leader of an organization. They are the one who sets the tone and at this Hampton, it\u2019s Jennifer Haskell, the general manager. She is an excellent GM and has assembled a fantastic group of people who are some of the most courteous, customer-centric and helpful people I\u2019ve ever encountered! Jennifer and her team really understand how to give excellent customer service and excel in this category!

Staff was friendly and they were having a pizza reception when I arrived. I had just eaten dinner so I didn't eat any, but was a nice touch. Just wish they would have had some cookies (really what I was craving), you can't look gift food in the mouth :) The lobby was large and had a lot of tables and chairs. Room The room had two queen beds and was on the smaller side for a Hampton Inn. Maybe because I usually get a King Executive and this was just plain two doubles (all they had)? As you walked in there was a nice new closet with a icy glass type door with ample hangers, a very clean iron and ironing board. There was a larger than average mini-fridge and a microwave. The room had a desk and chair for business travelers with wired free high speed that worked perfectly. There was also another odd chair kind of tucked into the work station. The HVAC unit was thermostat, which I know sounds stupid, but I don't really like as I enjoy having a constant background noise (fan) when I'm sleeping. Temperature regulation was fine. The beds were extrememly comfortable, firm, just like I like them with both poly and feather pillows. The TV was a nice newer HD or Plasma with ample cable channels and closed caption. I did open the drawer on the nightstand and found a bag with empty candy wrappers. A little concerning, but that was really my only complaint. Room was very quiet, I didn't hear much noise from other rooms, a little noise above me, but nothing to complain about. The bathroom was very nice and had a large top on the vanity. They provide a decent size shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Water pressure was fine and shower was okay, however the bar stuck out a lot so watch your elbows! Other The hotel had a very small fitness center with two treadmills and an elliptical, however the machines, like everything else in the hotel was brand new and they had the TV option, so you just plug into the jack and can watch anything you want. Very nice. Business Center looked fine, had a printer as well. Water will cost you $2 in the machine, so you might want to bring your own, they also have a snack shop.
