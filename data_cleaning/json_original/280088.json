Hotel de l'Europe is both. Situated a short (2 minute) walk from Gare du Nord it was perfect to let me get around the city easily. It is most certainly NOT a 5-star hotel. In fact it's not even 3-star, but it is clearly in a process of regeneration. The reception and communal breakfast area is modern, bright and clean and there's free wifi access in the lobby too. The accommodation itself is less impressive. I had a twin room with en suite. It was small and dark (as most rooms in a converted French city house are) and the view was... the building behind the hotel, but seeing as you can't sight-see Paris from your hotel window, this didn't really bother me. The en suite was functional with a shower cubicle so 'compact' that it would certainly dissuade you from over-indulging on the croissants. The room and corridor had clearly been recently painted, which made the room brighter and there was also a TV, should you want it. The bed itself was not great. It was very soft, like sleeping on a sponge cake and the concept of duvets has not made it there yet, so sheet and blanket is all you get. Despite this, the room, bathroom and bed were clean and cleaned daily, which is about as much as you can ask for in a cheap 2-star hotel. The best feature was the staff. Every single one of them was friendly and genuinely helpful, speaking clear French (for those of you who can) and good English (for those of you who can't). Breakfast (coffee & croissant) is available in the lobby for about 7 euros. I didn't have it, but can thoroughly recommend the Brasserie Terminus Du Nord which offers coffee, pastries and tartines (baguette, butter and jam) for the same price but in lovely traditional brasserie surroundings and allowing an excellent spot for people-watching early in the morning. All in all, the hotel is satisfactory if you just want somewhere to sleep. It's in a very convenient location and affordable. It's not really ideal for a romantic weekend but if you just want a (soft) bed for the hours inbetween tourist attractions then it's more than OK.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florianopolis, Brasi", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel in the trip\u201d", "Author": "Ricardo F Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR125225242", "Content": "We booked this hotel to stay for a night, close to Gare du Nord and easy to access the airport.

The property itself is very outdated, do not expect much from the decor. The rooms are not big but that's generally how it is in Europe - so for me and my mom it didn't come as a surprise. If you are looking for more spacious and bright rooms then do not book here. The washrooms were of a good size, mind you the have the older versions of sliding doors for their showers - so when you close the door it leaves a crease in the middle and the floor may get wet while you are showering. So just put a towel down before showering. The bathrooms came with all the essentials - you just have to open the mirror and they are all there. The corridors on all the floors have lights but due to sensors will turn themselves off when it realizes no one is walking by - so just flip the switch as you are turning into your corridor and it will automatically turn itself off after sometime (green initiatives). The property is situated on a busy street and close to a hospital - so some nights (even though they have sound proof walls and windows) we could hear ambulance sirens from time to time - but after a full day seeing sights and shopping we were too exhausted that we slept right through them. There is no safe in the room - so we just locked most valuables in our luggage and that was fine. You do leave your keycard at the reception before venturing off - this again was no surprise as most hotels in Europe ask of the same. The staff and owners are very very nice and helpful. They gave us great recommendations for places to eat and which form of transportation to take to reach our destination. The location of the property is excellent once you sort of get use to the surrounding areas. It feels like it would be a bit dodgy at night but it is safe. You are about a 5-7min walk from Gare du Nord - which metro trains can take you to every part of the city. When you do arrive at Gare du Nord, understand it is a very very busy station and also a bit run down. People will be rude and unhelpful, but if you try speaking a bit of french then have a tendency to be more willing to communicate with you - rather than you starting your sentence off in English, it's just how it is in Paris. Another great thing to being so close to Gare du Nord is that it is the station that offers multiple trains to Brussels, Belgium a day. If you are looking to cross another city of your list - you can take 1.5hr train to Brussels which I highly recommend just for the day. Located basically right in front of the hotel are many bus lines that - and it takes about 20-30mins to get into the city (depending on traffic). We didn't try the breakfast at the property, around the area you are situated there are amazing traditional french restaurants that offer the most amazing food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. My advice is to stay at this hotel if you don't mind a bit of an older property and are if you are on a budget. It has a great location with lots of great places to eat. Very close to the Montmartre district and Moulin Rouge as well and about 20-30mins away from central Paris.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cMy advice?

The hotel website looked fine, and the rooms also looked fine: http://europe-paris-hotel.com/ It was pretty easy to reach there from Charles-De-Gaulle airport. The moment I arrived in Gare du Nord was a huge disillusionment. It was not the Paris I had imagined. (Later, I asked other Parisians and they told me that it is the worst district in Paris. So, beware.) When I arrived at the hotel, the receptionist did not ask me for my identity/passport/reservation confirmation. He did not ask me to fill in a kind of form during check-in. So, if something bad happened, no one could prove or see that I stayed at the hotel. This wiped away all my trust. As I was a solo traveller, I had to be extra extra careful. Anyway, I went up to my room, and saw that there was no light in the corridor, I had to strive to find a switch. Finally I found my room. It was a stinky, stuffy, badly-decorated, tiny room. I went to the bathroom (no towels, no shampoo, no soap). There was a long semi-transparent window in the bathroom that people could see you (though blurred) from the outside. Then I went back to the room, opened the window, the view was dirty rooftops very nearby. And I could see a woman taking shower right across my window (half-blurred window). I checked the bed, saw that the pillow cases were dusty and dirty. One more thing, you cannot lock your door when you're inside the room. You just shut it. And believe me in a hotel like this, it does not make you feel secure. When you go out, you have to give your card back to the receptionist. It was around 9 pm; I was tired, hungry, totally uncomfortable and unhappy. So I decided to leave my suitcase at the hotel and have something to eat. One hour later I went back and decided to leave the hotel. I told the receptionist and he charged me 2 nights. This annoyed me greatly, because he insisted that I stayed that night, when all I did was to leave my suitcase inside for only 1 hour, and that he could not find someone to book for the other day, so I had to pay for 2 nights.

Gangs of young black men hang around the street corners and outside bars and restaurants. I went into a takeaway called \"Quick\" the French equivalent of McDonalds I think (and the food is just as bad! but it fills a hole!) anyway, just as I was leaving a young black guy came in, nothing wrong with that, however he watched me take my change something like 35 Euros and then immediately turned and and walked out. When I got out of the shop he approached me asking if I wanted a smoke I said no he then put his hand on my shoulder and muttered somthing like which football team do I support. Needless to say I made a quick exit towards the station.... it was not a pleasent experience and it i not the nicest of areas. OK the hotel....... what you get for your money is a room with a bed (or beds) and a bath or shower onsuite and thats all. The rooms are cleaned every day (no complants) , yes its a bit tatty the decor isn't the best the beds and the carpet have seen better days the TV has one english channel, there is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room or in the hotel (outside of breakfast). However I wasn't there to sit in a hotel room watching tv and drinking coffee I was there to see Paris so for me the hotel served its purpose and for the price I cannot complain. Ah I can complain! the noise from inside was deafening cause by people opening and closing doors during the night! and I'm deaf!!! (actually my wife will tell you I have selective hearing) :) I didn't try breakfast so cant comment. If this is your first trip to Paris be warned its expensive...very expensive. Cappuchino (5/6 Euros) the norm so I bought a kettle for 12Euros. If you are travelling with a baby then its a nightmare travelling. for example the Metro - very few stations have escelators (I didnt see any lifts), next time I may try the bus service! Similarly very few restaurants have highchairs (I think here in the UK its so easy to find restaurants with highchairs, maybe I expect too much!) and the baby changing facilities were none existant!! most of the restaurants are tiny so getting a pushchair in at all is difficult and once in you are always left with the impression that you are in the way and the quicker you leave the better. One plus point on the hotel they did allow me to use the microwave in the hotel to warm the baby's food. Incidentall no cots! Talking of pushchairs I remember thinking how on earth do people in wheelchairs cope! the place was a joke in this respect! I know I sound like I have a downer on the place I dont I loved Paris!! however next tiime I will be better prepared. Will I stay at this hotel? probably not I didnt particularly like the area. I did however dine at a restaurant DEGRES DE NOTRE DAME ( lesdegrehotel.com) which was great and reasonably price food three course lunch for 12.50E (Try it!) and they were great with the baby!

On our arrival we had to find the hotel, which although what appears to be quite quaint Parisian streets actually gave us the feeling of insecurity due to the type of people who were walking around. They all looked shifty and not at all pleasant. We found the hotel and entered the small reception area off the main street. The young man at the desk was lovey and very friendly. He checked us in and directed us to the lift, which was up about five steps. The lift was like a dumb waiter. Room for two suitcases and two people only and then it was a very tight squeeze. We had to close the gated doors to the lift ourselves. After a very rickety ride to the floor our room was located on we opened the door to be greeted by two rather old and tatty single beds. We entered and were mortified by the peeling wallpaper, the mouldy bathroom, and the window which looked out onto the street which could not be shut. The noise was overwhelming. The carpet was growing a life form of it's own. We sat down, forced ourselves not to cry and gathered our thoughts, and within five mintues we were back downstairs checking out. The nice young man asked what was wrong, and I told him that the place was a dump and that it was totally disgusting. He kept asking what was wrong and I told him that I had to check out as there was no way we could stay at this hotel and that it was so horrid that there was just no way we were going to stay there. During this he had called for the manager and I had logged onto the internet in the reception to try and get the hotels web site up so that I could show them the nice rooms they were displaying with the trendy wood floors and the almost Ikea style rooms. When the manager arrived he told me that there were rooms like this but they were more expensive and that I had not booked this style of room. I was so over the whole experience that I just said to him that there was no way I was paying the extra for a room as I just felt the whole hotel was a shamble and that I had to get out. So I did just that. I left and jumped into a taxi and went to the Ibis at Montmatre which was a much more pleasant and safe area to be in. In the defense of the manager, after contacting the booking agency with whom I had booked the hotel, they spoke to him and he refunded two of the nights out of the three that we had booked. This is of importance as they have a 72 hour cancellation policy so by right they did not have to do this. So be warned. This really is a horrid place to stay and I cannot emphasise this enough. If you are prepared to look furthur afield there are much nicer alternatives out there. Also unfortunately since I was only there for a matter of minutes I was unable to take any pictures, but there are some already here on trip advisor which show some of the horrors we had to face.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cClean and perfunctory\u201d", "Author": "elhoskins", "ReviewID": "UR45151214", "Content": "This hotel was very clean (a bonus for Paris) and easy to find and in a great location between the Gare du l'est and nord.

WHY WE BOOKED HERE: We seen a last-minute deal through Thomson and jumped at the chance to go to such a wonderful city at such a good price. We looked up the hotels website and were quite impressed with the pictures it showed and the hotels amenities, so we went ahead and booked. However, once we arrived we soon realised the pictures on the website do NOT look anything like the actual rooms! CHECK-IN: Check in was very easy and the member of staff was very helpful and very fluent in english. We found the other members of staff to be pleasant. THE HOTEL ITSELF: The reception and breakfast area is very clean and we had no complaints about this. However, its once you approach the stairs to go up to your room, that you start to panic. The carpet on the stairs was tearing away from the wall and looked dirty. You walk up a few steps to the lift, which is approx 5ft X 2ft. Its the smallest lift I have ever been in and it just fits comfortably 2 average size people and 1 suitcase. Disabled people would have no easy way of getting to their room. Once out of the lift, the corridors are riduculous. Dingy wallpaper and yet again more tatty red carpet. Our room was situated at the end of a very dark corridor. Very squeaky floorboards!!!! There was a WC on our floor and my partner went to look in it and found a thong lying on the floor. Not a good impression for a guest. THE ROOM: The room itself was an average size and was big enough for the double occupancy. The bed was bearably comfortable but we weren't expecting luxury. There was exposed pipes running down one wall and everytime someone from the room upstairs flushed the toilet, you could hear the flushing down the pipes and the vibrations it made. The room door I didnt feel was safe. There was a latch lock near the top that had been broken off and there was no actual lock on the inside (however, when you went out of the room and closed the door, you couldnt open it again, so it was a little reassuring!) There was no air-conditioning so at night (espec in july/august) it got very warm and you had to leave the window open. The bathroom was a diaster. It was so small you couldn't even get dressed properly after having a shower. The shower was also very very tiny. There was bits of mould around the ceiling and on some tiles, as there was no fan to let the steam from the shower escape. So when you took a shower the room was absolutely roasting. EXTRAS: There were no extras at all in the room, which would probably be expected from a 2 star (i'm not quite sure!) - but I thought there would have at least been soap in the bathroom... but no! CLEANLINESS: The bed was clean. There was wallpaper peeling from the walls though. The bathroom was clean too (toilet/sink) apart from around the corners of the ceiling where small bits of mould had started to form! The reception area was immaculate! If only they put the same effort into their rooms!!! SERVICE: The staff were very helpful and were able to speak very good english. We asked about a safety disposit box and were told that it was a safe hotel but there was a safety deposit at reception if we needed it. The morning after we arrived, we heard a guest asking for his valuables to be put safely away, the reception staff member took the belongings and placed them in an unlocked cupboard, which i presume was the \"safety deposit box\" so we ended up having to lock our valuables in our suitcase. BREAKFAST: This was very simple but it was expected of a european hotel and a 2 star one! We got a piece of baguette, a croissant, orange juice and coffee. My partners orange juice was served in a glass which was cracked nearly a third of the way round near the bottom. LOCATION: The hotel was very handy to the Gare du Nord where connections to the airport and central paris were very easy. Distance from the station was around 5 mins walk. There were alot of beggers and homeless people around this area so its not the nicest of places. However, the cafes/bars opposite the entrance to the station are very nice so I'd recommend you give these a try. The hotel is situated on a busy road so its very noisy during the daytime (but this doesn't really matter because you're out!). At night, it seems that everyone with a motorised scooter comes out and races up and down that road, so its difficult etting to sleep. The warmth of the room made you open the window but then you got the endless noise of scooters and police/ambulances. The website says there's \"soundproofing\" of the walls. Nonsense. OVERALL: If your looking for a one night stop-over or if you're REALLY well and truely strapped for cash, then this hotel might just do the trick. But if like us, you're looking for a romantic getaway for a week, its well worth looking into another area (I suggest Notre Dame!) The hotel is in a conveinent location and the condition of the hotel is very very basic. It's rated a 2 star but I would only give it a 1. It needs a lick of fresh paint, new carpet n the removal of mould in the bathroom!!!", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane girl in London", "Title": "\u201cConvenient base for tourists in Paris\u201d", "Author": "BrissyGirl-in-London", "ReviewID": "UR18314191", "Content": "We found this family run hotel perfectly located for our 4 day stay in Paris.
