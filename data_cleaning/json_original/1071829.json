The hotel is way outside the centre of Amsterdam but access to and from the centre (and main train station) is easy from the nearby tram (number 4) terminus. If you have an OV chip card the nearby metro station will again give you easy access to Amsterdam Centraal railway station. Schiphol airport is a short train ride away from Amsterdam Rai railway station. RAI station, Tram terminus and Metro station are all located together and around 100m from the hotel. If you want to experience Amsterdam culture and chiming churches and canals this hotel isn't for you and you will need to spend probably 3 times the price getting an equal standard of hotel in the centre.

The RAI is about a 10 minute walk so the hotel's location is good, so long as it's not raining. The hotel overall is basic and passable but has a lot of annoying aspects. The decor is dated, the carpets are dirty and shabby, and the hotel overall feels cheap, cramped, and in need of an update. If I were coming to the RAI again I'd try the Holiday Inn across the street, though I haven't investigated its reviews. Here are the things I found frustrating about this hotel: 1. Brusque front desk service. My assistant (no longer working for me) had goofed and booked me for arrival a day earlier than I actually arrived. This was a surprise to me. The desk clerk was more obnoxious about it than necessary. 2. The hotel provides free wireless internet, which is certainly a plus, but it requires going through a very annoying start page to accept their terms every time you connect. My cell phone, iPad, computer, etc. would all drop the connection after awhile, necessitating going through this hassle over and over and over and over again. Why can't they just provide internet and be done with it? Or have their system remember the MAC address of each device and the fact that it has ALREADY accepted the terms! 3. The hotel has only four elevators and these are absolutely overwhelmed at check-in and check-out hours. I wound up waiting in large crowds of people for long periods of time just to get to the lobby or up to my floor. I also had many a ride up and down that stopped on EVERY floor due to the overload. 4. The gym is OK ... a couple of treadmills, a couple of elipticals, a couple of stationary bikes, and some rudimentary weights. It's located on the \"first\" floor (the floor above the ground floor) and there is no way to get to it by the elevators. They don't stop on that floor! You have to go to the lobby, then walk up stairs to the first floor. But then there is a nasty surprise waiting for you: your key won't open the gym! You have to go back to the lobby, wait in line for a desk clerk (in your gym shorts!), and ask them to activate your room key card for the gym. It's unfathomable why they don't just do this automatically with every room key. 5. When phoned, the staff is helpful but VERY slow to respond to anything that requires someone coming to the room. They promised to bring me various items, pick up laundry, etc. Each time it took 30 minutes or more before the promised person showed up. 6. The maid cleaning my room screwed up something just about every day. Examples: didn't replace an obviously dirty used drinking glass, did not provide a new doorknob card for ordering breakfast (requiring a call to the front desk and long wait to get one), did not replace the coffee creamers after I had used them up. 7. My room was too hot and there was no way to cool it down. The room has separate controls for heat and air conditioning. I turned the heat off and turned the air conditioning to maximum. Result? The air vent made a lot of noise but just recirculated the air in the room without cooling it. I think the air conditioning system must be turned off because it's winter. The room does have a window that can be opened, but only a tiny bit (presumably for safety reasons). I wound up leaving it open all the time but the room was still too hot. 8. Along with #7, a huge frustration was that the hotel provides only a thick down duvet, which is much too hot for the temperature of the room. 9. The hotel has room service food but the menu options are extremely limited. It's the shortest room service menu I've seen anywhere.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "west midlands", "Title": "\u201cNovotel made our amsterdam trip magical !!!!\u201d", "Author": "lyndsey s", "ReviewID": "UR126189928", "Content": "Hello me and my boy friend just got back from the novotel ansterdam , 1st impressions very clean and staff were straight there to check you in no hanging around got card x2 for the room even got a card to the sauna (shame i didnt take my cozi )then straight up to the room great sized room the bed was huge and a choice of soft and hard pillows which i thought was a nice touch .Bed sheets and fresh towles changed every day ,there is a mini bar which you get your own key for but we recomend taking your own munch and pop with you as both hotel and amterdam prices for pop crisps chocolate is unreal 5 euros for bottle water.we paid 12 euros for 2 cans of pop and two chocolates .

The desert alone was 7.5 euro's, which i wouldn't mind but it was nouvelle cuisine to the extreme. A little cake the size of a table spoon on a big plate with some mango sauce dribbled on the side. Terrible! If the prices weren't so high, the food better and more choice, then maybe they would have more guests staying for dinner. I cannot be alone in thinking this because on every night i was there, only a small handful of people were having dinner when i walked past the restaurant.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "Spotngrey", "ReviewID": "UR122351913", "Content": "Service was good.

Large spread of salads, bread, meats, cheeses, omelets to order, on and on. The room was clean and comfortable; being American it isn't spacious but is cozy.

This French owned group are not the most inviting hoteliers and tend to go for middle-of-the road-hospitality. Or so I thought. It's obviously too long ago since I stayed in one of the Accor products. Close to the RAI exhibition centre and Amsterdam RAI station -walking distance- I found a pleasant exception, although I recognised some standard Accor-style elements. There is nothing else around the hotel to nip out to, no shops, no bars, no nothing. Price/Quality ratio is fine. And to dispel the notion about all cabs in Amsterdam being bad: from Novotel I took a cab twice to the RAI (an extremely short trip of 7.50 euro), and was neither overcharged nor refused. I found that sticking to a brand (TCA in this case) often makes sure you're not fleeced. At least you have a come-back if it should happen. Just don't take 'unlabeled' cabs (no or neutral roofsign) from Central Station or Leidseplein. Go for a brand-name. Reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful (the display of Sinterklaas-delicacies you could help yourself to whilst checking in, helped), check-in was swift and the room was large enough for two. Perhaps not large, but the fact that there is a couch and a chair helps. The area where the lifts are is strangely wide and decidedly bland and boring. Room service was quick and helpful, choice is not particularly large. Just one comment about catering: when my wife showed up for breakfast five minutes before closing, staff at the entrance were decidedly unfriendly, as if they were unhappy that she had turned up in the last five minutes before closing. Breakfast is large and varied. The bar area is nice. Staff are helpful and friendly. One big minus though: when you're sitting at the tables near the entrance beware: cars and cabs dropping people at the entrance often leave their lights on, which shine straight at you in the bar. A foil on the outside windows would prevent this from happening.

We got our room at a very good rate which includes complimentary breakfast for all of us (it costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22.50 per pax). We love the air-conditioned room in summer, shower & bathtub in room with basic amenities, but sufficient. Our shower head was not working well on first day, it was fixed the next day morning and the hotel staff actually stop by to ask if everything is ok, which is a nice gesture. The hotel is situated right next to a broad major road but the traffic from street is not affecting us in the room (we're on 4-th floor).

From airport, it takes 7 minutes train to hotel; and tram4 travels to city centre at 10mins interval, total journey takes 10 - 15 minutes (depending on where you get off). We checked in early, and as we leave our luggage, the very friendly staff gave us some maps, showed us the major attraction areas, gave us restaurant recommendations, and even provide us with public transport time table (tram & night bus) with detail description. Big breakfast buffet area with nice spread (love their made to order omelettes) and reasonable quality. Novotel handles a large number of guests (get the impression from breakfast crowd), and they're doing a good job. The only down side with such high occupancy rate hotel is lift/elevator capacity. There are 4 elevators but at 'rush hour', it is not enough to handle all crowds, but no problem for us, just take the next available one :) It is a bit outside of city center but that's why we get much more room space for the price we pay.

Also, as someone who never stays in hotels that allow children (I am a primary school teacher and want peace and quiet on my holidays) a hotel full of teenagers filled me with horror but you would not have known they were there. I can't rate this hotel enough and I wouldn't change anything about the whole weekend if I could do it all over again.-don't be put off by the grounds outside the entrance as they are landscaping to make the hotel even better. The food is outstanding both room service, breakfast in bed and the restaurant which is expensive but worth every penny. The rooms were bigger than I expected and very clean. Free use of the internet for 20 mins every day was fantastic to check up on flight details especially with BA striking. The staff at the hotel couldn't do enough for us especially Oliver at the bar who I would recommend asking for an ATB (Ask The Bartender) or a Jack in the box cocktail. The hotel is not in the city centre but once you have seen the number of tourists pouring in and out of the hotels to check them out or book dinner you will be pleased to have chosen this hotel. After 12o'clock you need to get a taxi back (20euros) as no trains or metros go to Rai station directly and for this price it is cheap! (I am comparing this to Amsterdam prices where a Macdonalds happy meal is \u00c2\u00a38 -yes you read that correctly!!! 4 times the price of ours!!!) Ask at Reception for a hotel card so that if you are too drunk or stoned you can show it to any taxi driver who will get you home and there is no haggling over prices as everything is done on a meter. Hotel Location is perfect next to Rai station and the number 4 tram (where we were first on and last off so you will get a seat). (Note you pay for the tickets actually on the tram) We brought an 'I amsterdam' card which was worth every penny as free transport (just scan your card like an oyster card) as well as getting into lots of places for free e.g. Van Gogh and the map and information inside the guide book were fantastic as it tells you everything you need to know e.g. what transport you need to take, opening hours, prices and information on all the attractions and restaurants in Amsterdam City. Note on Amsterdam itself: Lots of fun but very, very expensive so take LOTS of money. We didn't leave our hotel until midday each day and in 3 days managed to: Day 1: Anne Franks house, sex museum, erotic museum, candle light canal cruise & red light district. We walked from central station to Anne Franks house it is not far!! Day 2: Nemo science museum, Heineken Experience & the Ice Bar. Day 3: Van Gogh, House of Bols, Amsterdam Dungeon & Grasshopper Coffee shop We even had time to spare where we couldn't think of anywhere else we wanted to visit and so relaxed back at the hotel. Only had to queue for Van Gogh and Anne Frank all the rest we just walked into. Personally I would advice you to do the Heineken Experience out of everything - as there was so much to do and it was FUN!!!

To be honest I was a little worried becasue of some of the negative reviews about the hotel being under renovation and the fact someone said the receiption and restaurant was in a \"tent\" in the carpark. I got there and was plesently supprised. We arrived at the airport and got a train to Station Rai. Stepped out the station turned right and we could see our hotel! Only a 5min walk or less and we were checking in. As for this \"tent\" in the carpark, its not a tent at all. It is a purpouse built structure and is very nice. The moment we stepped inside the noise (what little there was) stopped. Its very well sound proofed and air conditioned. We arrived very early (9:30am) and were allowed to check in straight away no questions asked. There was free internet on 2 macs in the reception and all in all my worries that I had before arriving soon faded. The rooms are very nice, spacious and clean. We were on the 15th floor and had a great view. There was a good selection for breakfast and is what you would expect from a hotel. I would highly recommend booking a room that includes breakfast. Breakfast alone is a bit pricey at 21euros! But worth it when booked with the room for an extra \u00c2\u00a35 or so. Yes this hotel is not right in the center of things but I liked that. I researched everything before I went so I knew there was the metro station close to the hotel, along with the trams (number 4). I knew we would be staying out later than the metro or trams would run, and there is a night bus that runs every half hour from 12:30am right through to 6:00am! Take the number 354a bus and it will drop you outside station Rai. It really is so easy to get around the city and exeptional value if you but a 24/48/72 hour ticket. These can be purchased from the metro section of station Rai from the machine. The people that worked there were very helpful and showed us what we needed to get.

The 2nd time my booking said I was supposed to get an executive room which from the description made it sound like it was one up from the standard room, but it was exactly the same as the first time around! Room: Pretty small, 2 twin beds which I hate as I'm clearly 1 person I don't think it was fully booked. You can't even move them together as they're fixed to the floor! Bed wasn't very comfortable. It was however clean, had tea/coffee, nice enough bathroom. TV had more English channels than usual for a foreign hotel (usually just BBC news), had BBC1 & 2 which was nice. Service: Friendly staff - one thing I am disappointed with is that on my 2nd visit I was asked if I wanted to sign up for A Club theit loyalty scheme. As you can transfer the points to BA ones I said yes. I received an email shortly afterwards asking me to activate mt membership which I did. It said points arrive a few days after your stay. I didn't stay in another Accor hotel for over 6 months and I only checked my account a few days ago as I am booking into one (why would I check it otherwise?!). There were no points and when I contacted them to get them put on I was told you have to make the claim within 6 months. I find this quite poor considering that I signed up in the hotel when I checked in and received an email acknowledging this, so clearly I had stayed in the hotel, why were they not on my account? As I said its not like I had any reason to look at my account in the meantime, and I of course trusted them to do their job. This isn't really an issue with the hotel, more Accor, but I thought I'd put it on here. Food: Breakfast has a pretty good choice. I was disappointed with my dinner the 2nd time staying. I had a goats cheese salad, one of my favourite meals, and it was horrible. The goats cheese was more of a spread, it had a weird garlicy taste and a light airy texture, not at all like how I ever tasted it. The bread it was on wasn't toasted and really, for the price it was just very disappointing. The bar is small but cosy, we were there so long they were kind to let us stay a bit after it had closed but eventually had to tell us to leave! Location: Depends where you need to be. For the RAI it is perfect, a short walk away.

Many different coffees and teas to suit all taste buds. The staff are all very friendly and the tables and cutlery are spotless.

Over all, for the price, I am happy with what I got.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton, California", "Title": "\u201cWorth it\u201d", "Author": "Olga P", "ReviewID": "UR7697481", "Content": "We stayed here for three days and enjoyed it quite a bit.

The train is also there which you can take to Schipol Airport or Leiden if looking for the gardens. The location was great, breakfast was really good and we had it included in our rate. It gave us a chance to really start our day nice. Although we stayed out late every evening we never had an issue or felt unsafe. The twin room was small by our standards here in the states but was perfect for people who are basically in and out on vacation. Bathrooms were new and modern. The staff friendly and helpful.

It is also 2 minutes from Rai train station, where you can catch trains to and from the hotel. Staff were helpful and the reception dest sells strips of tram tickets.

I had two different rooms in this hotel. The first, unfortunately, was right by the elevator; the second was nicer. As in all European hotels, the room is small by American standards. It does not have a full shower door, but instead a panel that covers maybe a quarter of the shower. You'll easily get used to it. The restaurant downstairs is a good place for very basic food, and for the free breakfast. You might as well eat there during your stay. The concierge and front desk were very friently. Don't worry: their English is excellent.

We needed a hotel with reasonable prices, accessible for wheelchair and preferably in the center. After almost losing hope we found the Novotel which had 2 of the 3. It was a bit out of the center, but it had a trm station near by that took us within 15 minutes to the center of town. The price was good: we found a hot deal ON THE SITE of the hotel, where they claimed to give you an extra discount if you find a cheper price than their's on the internet. The room wasn't very big but fine for us. It was clean and kept up nicely. The bathroom was all set up for disabled. The staff was helpful and polite. We had breakfast only once, through room service. Although it was nice I don't think it was worth the 18.5 Euro per person they took for it. The bottom line: Nothing fancy but suits all your needs if you don't mind being out of the immediate center. 2 small things: 1. While making the reservation I specified a wheelchair accessible room, but when I called the morning before leaving to make sure all is in order they didn't have it written down. 2. At check out they almost charged us for 4 breakbasts altough we had only one. Not on purpose, I'm sure. Just keep out for those things.
