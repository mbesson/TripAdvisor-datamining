{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The Beijing Ritz- A great experience Although we traveled in April, I am finally getting around to posting about our China trip. Normally, we prefer to venture on our own, but for China we decided to take an organized tour. After a lot of research, we chose the Pacific Delight tour company- the 13 Day Golden Route Gold Experience (Beijing, Shanghai, Xi\u9225\u6a83n, Guilin, and Hong Kong). We chose this company based on the small group size and the upgraded hotels. And what a fabulous time we had. The tour was great- there were only twelve people in our group and our guide was efficient and knowledgeable. In Beijing, we stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Beijing for three nights. Since it was April, we benefited a lot from the build-up/clean-up for the Olympics, without the crowds. :-) Ha. The hotel had only been open for a few months, was beautifully appointed and oh so clean and shiny. It\u9225\u6a9a located very close to a high-end shopping mall and, for die-hard Starbucks fans, there is one located steps away from the hotel. After check in, since we had just spent 17 hours travelling, we were pretty tired. So we took a walk through the mall and ate dinner in one of the nice restaurants there. We made a good choice and were pretty pleased with our first meal in China. Unfortunately, the hotel seemed pretty far away from the other places we wanted to go to in Beijing, making it kind of inconvenient to just hop in a taxi to explore for a short period of time.The rooms were spacious and the beds, pillows, and linens were very comfortable. This became important, since my body decided not to sleep a full night for my entire stay. I was able to lie comfortably and watch tv, which was a nice-sized flat screen. The bathrooms were also very big. We did have one small glitch with the bathroom. The shower was glass-enclosed, separating it from the toilet, which was also glass-enclosed. When we would shower, the water would seep into the toilet area. We had to roll up a towel and lay it along the bottom so that the toilet area did not flood. Other than that, our room was perfect. Housekeeping was very attentive. We called for transformers and they were there within three minutes. A second call for plug adapters had the same quick response. The hotel was absolutely beautiful, and the rest of the staff we encountered were polite and provided superb customer service. One of our favorite places in a hotel when we are on vacation is the hotel bar. We always have a cocktail or two at the end of the night to wind down and recap the day. Although, Beijing is relatively inexpensive, we were at the Ritz and paid Ritz prices. The bar/lounge was very comfortable, with several types of seating arrangements. They provide nibblers to go along with your drinks, played different music each night, and the bar staff was very attentive without being obtrusive.We did not spend too much time at the hotel, but our Peking Duck dinner was scheduled there. The food was delicious, but the service was kind of confused. In the end, all was well. I attribute that to the newness of the hotel and them still working out a couple of the kinks. Breakfasts were large buffets that were elaborate, multi-cultural and pretty satisfying. The same for the other dinner buffet. As with any buffet, there were some foods that were much better than others. But, it allowed you to try different types of foods, without completely committing.What we did in Beijing: Tiananmen Square; Forbidden City\u9225\u6a9a Imperial Palace with jewelry section; Summer Palace; Beijing Duck dinner party; The Great Wall; Cloisonn\u8305 Factory; Hutong tour via pedicab; Drum Tower; visit with local Siheyuan family; Temple of Heaven. Our favorite was the awesomeness of the Great Wall. The least favorite: the peddlers- they are everywhere and will swarm around you (even on the Great Wall). If you ignore them, they won\u9225\u6a9b bug you as much. However, we had a couple who bought from everyone and peddlers were relentless. The traffic is crazy. We had great bus drivers, but even they got into situations that would make your hair stand on end. And many of the places we went to were just opportunities for them to sell something (cloisonn\u8305, local family visit).", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR710039118", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "L&JinVA"}, {"Content": "A great hotel for Beijing. Having read some of the other reviews I'd like to make a few points. Firstly the location is indeed set away from the tourist areas, it's in a business district but only 5 stops on the Metro / Subway to the Forbidden City and the fare is 0.20 EUR. The station is outside the hotel, the trains are frequent, clean and it's an interesting experience. Why take a taxi and get caught up in the traffic? Secondly the hotel is in China so English is not their first language. Of course some staff will have a better grasp than others, however, the staff here are way above average in their language skills so don't worry.The hotel is very new and well furnished. Rooms are of a good size but in some aspects the finish is not perfect but during our stay there was plenty of repainting going on now that the building has settled.The spa and pool are first class, whilst the pool is not the size of a public swimming pool it does not need to be as it is seldom busy.Breakfast offers a huge selection but is a little pricey. The hotel restaurants offer a good standard with Italian themed 'Barolo' being particularly notable and I believe has won an award already. Drinks are not cheap as is usual in China so bring a bottle or two of wine from duty free if you like to indulge in a nightcap.Enjoy!", "Date": "Dec 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR489387970", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Achilles_F12"}, {"Content": "More than 5 stars hotel Fisrt, it has a very good location.

The service is very professional--we were constantly greeted and asked if we needed anything. Although the decor is very traditional Victorian the hotel is actually almost brand new--rooms are quite spacious, and the usual high end comfort items are here (towels, cosmetics, robes/slippers, etc.). We found the king bed to be very comfortable and, thankfully for the jet lagged, the sound insulation worked well. Our package included the buffet breakfast downstairs next to the lobby and we found it to be quite good, except for some rough spots (the asian dishes tended to be better than the Western food--cardboard pancakes and burned waffles??). It's located next to Shin Kong shopping mall, the hot it place for shoppers. You've got to eat in the restaurant floor upstairs where some of the best food in Beijing is located. There's a branch of Din Tai Fung--soup dumpling heaven!!--along with several other excellent restaurants. The hotel is located approximately 20 minutes by car from the Forbidden City and Tiannemen square, and the subway system is just around the corner, so the location is quite convenient. Overall we found the hotel to be very nice, perhaps not 5 star, but in Beijing it's probably the best combination of comfort, class, and location.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR999042467", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "travelsny"}, {"Content": "fantastic stay Stayed here for 8 nights in June during a business trip to China.

But at $850 a night, I am not so sure.The hotel is in the middle of what? A faceless, souleless zone of high rises and high-end shops peddling international branded items at super inflated prices. No character, no thought to planning and as memorable as an airport terminal. Nothing intrinsically wrong but nothing particularly right. The well established faux English furnishings seemed completely out of place in this anonymous environment. Comfortable but depressing. Finish was poor, everything slid off the bathroom shelf, bath tiles cracked and not properly fixed. Walls were paper thin. Not built to last.Lobby is designed to keep people out being very small but then of course becomes very crowded as there is nowehere else to wait.Had a very poor and expensive dinner at the Aroma restaurant. Food indifferent and appaling wines from a very limited list at an average price of $130 a bottle. Not much better at breakfast. But what a contrast at Barolo, the hotel's Italian restaurant which was superb under the tutored eye of Ronnie Rizzi and his German-Greek co-maitre whose name I didn't catch but who supervised a great dining experience.Pool meets the length test (25 metres) but narrow as a strand of spaghetti so seemed full with only a couple of other swimmers. Wet part of the spa: steam etc was good and had a large terrace from which to survey the bland tower scape.However, the biggest failing was that the staff were not that well trained and English was a real struggle as is my Mandarin. Simple requests either didn't get met or had to be presented in a variety of ways to build an understanding. Willing but not very capable.Calling the concierge was immensely frustrating as they never answered the phone, particularly important as I was outside the hotel and needed to change pick-up times. This happened repeatedly. Not good enough.Hotel transfer to the airport is twice the price of the Peninsula: RMB 1460 vs 700 in an Audi 6 vs a BMW 7 series and it's closer, so how does that work?All in all a disappointing experience and management just weren't ready for the Big Event.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR265063843", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "nowvoyager1"}, {"Content": "Worthy of all the praise and more!

The Ritz Carlton stands next to the equally good looking and new JW Marriott Hotel. The staff at the Rtiz Carlton are exemplary, always trying their best to meet all your needs and more. Perhaps this is because the hotel is still relatively new (it opened only in Dec 2007) and trying to impress. When I was there, I was surprised to see some tour groups staying in the hotel - this made the small lobby noisy and rather chaotic at times.
